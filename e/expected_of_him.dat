5|$|Throughout the book, Chomsky {{discusses}} {{what the}} Occupy movement {{is and what}} it is demanding, as well as advocating ways in which it could gain greater support and achieve governmental reforms, using historical examples as evidence. Press reviews were largely positive, with some noting that Chomsky had taken a more moderate, reformist position than they <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
5|$|Vaughan Williams's {{family would}} have {{preferred}} him to have remained at Charterhouse for two more years {{and then go on}} to Cambridge University. They were not convinced that he was talented enough to pursue a musical career, but feeling {{it would be wrong to}} prevent him from trying, they had allowed him to go to the RCM. Nevertheless, a university education was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> and in 1892 he temporarily left the RCM and entered Trinity College, Cambridge, where he spent three years, studying music and history.|$|E

25|$|For {{the first}} few years of his UFO studies, Hynek could safely be {{described}} as a debunker. He thought that a great many UFOs could be explained as prosaic phenomena misidentified by an observer. In his 1977 book, Hynek admitted that he enjoyed his role as a debunker for the Air Force. He also noted that debunking was what the Air Force <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
25|$|Xun Xu {{served in}} the privy council and {{was in charge of}} state secrets for a long time. He was not only a talented writer, but also a deep thinker who {{understood}} very well his place as a subject of his lord. He knew what his lord <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and adapted his behaviour accordingly to please his lord. That was why he managed to remain in Emperor Wu's favour and live a comfortable life until his death.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, {{fresh from}} winning the 1994 FIFA World Cup with the Brazil {{national}} team, became {{manager at the}} Mestalla in 1994. Parreira immediately signed Spanish goalkeeper Andoni Zubizarreta and Russian forward Oleg Salenko, as well as Predrag Mijatović, but failed to produce the results <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> He was replaced by new coach José Manuel Rielo. The club's earlier successes continued to elude it, {{although it was not}} short of top coaching staff like Luis Aragonés and Jorge Valdano, as well as foreign star forwards like Brazilian Romário, Argentineans Claudio López and Ariel Ortega, and Adrian Ilie from Romania.|$|E

25|$|The {{expectation}} {{was that}} Koerner would prevent Spain from entering into the American Civil War {{on the side}} of the Southern slave states. Although Koerner, the Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary of the United States of America (his precise titles as ambassador) managed to accomplish this objective, he was discontented in Spain and asked the president several times for a replacement. An important reason prompting his request was that the stipend for his ambassadorship did not nearly cover the huge financial obligations <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at the Spanish court. Koerner had to provide such funds from his private accounts. In 1864, he left the diplomatic service and returned to the United States.|$|E
25|$|A 'Welcome Home Ken Barrington' {{dance was}} {{arranged}} {{on his return}} from New Zealand where he was presented with a silver trophy to a standing ovation {{in front of the}} Surrey team. With the Ashes left in Australia the English press focused on Barrington's achievements and much was hoped for against the West Indies in 1963. Frank Worrell was the first full-time African-Caribbean cricketer to captain the West Indies and had a colourful team in the shape of Conrad Hunte, Rohan Kanhai, Gary Sobers, Basil Butcher, Lance Gibbs, Wes Hall and Charlie Griffith. Barrington made 110 not out against them for Surrey (the next highest score was 22) and joked that the Test match would be over in three days as England had gone 13 Tests against the West Indies without defeat. The First Test was a rude awakening as he was out for 16 and 8 and England lost by an innings. The Second Test at Lord's is one of the Great Tests; the West Indies made 301 and Barrington top scored with 80 in England's reply of 297. The West Indies were out for 229 in the second innings and England needed 234 to win. Barrington made 60, added 99 runs with Colin Cowdrey (whose arm was broken by Wes Hall) and Brian Close and hit Gibbs for a six followed by another onto the Lord's balcony. A last minute collapse left England 228/9 with Cowdrey returning to the crease in the last over with victory, defeat, a tie or a draw still possible. As it was Dave Allen played for a draw. Fred Trueman's 12/119 won the Third Test at Edgbaston, but Barrington made only 9 and 1, followed by 25, 32, 16 and 28 as Worrell's team won the last two Tests and the series 3–1. For all the excitement provided by the tourists it was a bad series for Barrington as {{this was the kind of}} cricket he had forsaken and his 275 runs (27.50) was less than what was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Even so, he published his first book with Phil Riley called Running in Hundreds, detailing his struggle to play for England and rise to fame.|$|E

60|$|The dinner began quietly {{enough with}} the cowboys divided between embarrassment and {{voracious}} appetites that they evidently feared to indulge.

500|$|Another {{psychological}} theory used by Blassingame is role theory. According to this theory, [...] "a person's {{behavior is}} generally {{determined by the}} socially defined roles or the behavioral patterns <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> in certain situations." [...] Blassingame asserts that through applying interpersonal and role theory to the fugitive slave narratives, historians can determine [...] "the extent to which slaves acted the way their masters expected them to behave" [...] and how the Sambo, Jack, and Nat personality types can be misleading.|$|E
500|$|We {{would have}} little family talks. They began at first with Malcolm telling me what he {{expected}} of a wife.

After dinner one night he said, [...] "Boy, Betty, something you said hit me like a ton of bricks. Here I've been going along having our little workshops with me doing all the talking and you doing all the listening." [...] He concluded our marriage should be a mutual exchange.|$|E

Tall for his age, Lincoln was also strong and athletic. He attained a reputation for brawn and audacity after a very competitive wrestling match with the renowned leader of a group of ruffians known as [...] "the Clary's Grove boys".|$|E

6000|$|For a time, Jack Chase, out of {{a polite}} {{nervousness}} touching myself, as a newly-elected member of the club, would frequently endeavour to excuse to me the vulgarity of Shanks.

500|$|Elizabeth {{demanded of}} her Lieutenant-General to refrain at all cost from any decisive action with Parma, {{which was the}} {{opposite}} of what Leicester wished and what the Dutch <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> After some initial successes, the unexpected surrender of the strategically important town of Grave was a serious blow to English morale. Leicester's fury turned on the town's governor, Baron Hemart, whom he had executed despite all pleadings. The Dutch nobility were astonished: even the Prince of Orange would not have dared such an outrage, Leicester was warned; but, he wrote, he would not be intimidated by the fact that Hemart [...] "was of a good house".|$|E
500|$|Kikukawa convened an {{emergency}} board meeting on 14 October, and then, arriving late, cancelled the circulated agenda {{and asked the}} board to consider removing Woodford from his post of chief executive. Woodford {{was not allowed to}} speak or vote; the motion was carried unanimously, although he retained his seat on the board of directors. Kikukawa circulated a staff email the same day, stating that the departure was due to differences in management style, and that Woodford had [...] "ignored established decision-making processes and created many wedges among the managers and within the organization... vastly different to what we had <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> which was to accelerate decision-making and speed up the management." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music for}} Myst and Riven was {{composed}} by Robyn Miller; Jack Wall created the {{score for the}} third installment. Irish stated that developing the music {{was one of the}} hardest aspects of Exile: [...] "We had to match or exceed the surrealistic style of music that Robyn [...] had pioneered. It had to be recognizable as Myst, but unique and distinctive." [...] Wall looked at the increasing complexity of games as an opportunity to give players a soundtrack with as much force as a movie score. Wall also echoed Irish's opinion that he wanted to make a very different score from the [...] "wonderful sonic pastiche" [...] of Myst and Riven, yet still recognizable as a sequel to the earlier games; Wall considered copying Miller's style as the [...] "safe" [...] yet unappealing route that was <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|The Nordiques finally {{acquired}} Gélinas on June 20, 1993, {{in exchange}} for Scott Pearson. He lasted only 31 games with Quebec before being placed on waivers and claimed by the Vancouver Canucks. After scoring 16 points in 33 games to end the 1993–94 regular season with Vancouver, Gélinas added nine points in 24 playoff games. The Canucks reached the 1994 Stanley Cup Final but were defeated in seven games by the New York Rangers. In the lockout-shortened 1994–95 season, he scored 23 points in 46 games and won his first of two consecutive Fred J. Hume Awards as Vancouver's [...] "unsung hero". Gélinas finally achieved the offensive production <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> when he was drafted by recording consecutive 30-goal seasons. He scored 30 goals in 1995–96 and led the Canucks with 35 goals, was second to Alexander Mogilny with 68 points and recorded a four-goal game against the Phoenix Coyotes in 1996–97. He won three team awards: The Cyclone Taylor Award as Vancouver's most valuable player, the Molson Cup for earning the most three star selections and the Most Exciting Player Award.|$|E
500|$|Roberts {{described}} Joseph as an [...] "awkward {{and very}} bookish" [...] character, one who struggled {{to relate to}} his patients, {{in contrast to the}} [...] "happy-go-lucky Sam", which resulted in comedy as [...] "Sam is the antithesis of Joe." [...] He also deemed his character [...] "incredibly honest and morally upright", [...] "a total oddball with all sorts of hang-ups", and as being [...] "very stuck in his ways." [...] During his tenure, these aspects of his characterisation have each been explored. It was revealed in Joseph's first appearance that both his father and grandfather had been pioneering cardiothoracic Consultants, and that it had always been <b>expected</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> to follow the same path. [...] His residual guilt over his brother's attempted suicide was developed throughout his first few months at Holby City Hospital. Roberts commented on the event that: [...] "It underpins much of his behaviour. He is a man burdened by guilt and loss. I think I can be so bold as to say he transfers many of his feelings about his brother onto patients and staff alike, without ever betraying the source of his pain." [...] Joseph's resultant fastidiousness developed into OCD, something he attempted to control and hide by use of relaxant medication.|$|E
