40|$|A new trap, {{named the}} 'H trap', was {{developed}} at Hellsgate Tsetse Research Station in South Africa for the simultaneous collection of live Glossina brevipalpis Newstead and Glossina austeni Newstead. Its design followed {{an evaluation of}} the responses of the two species towards traps that are used elsewhere in Africa for the collection of other tsetse fly species. These traps were found at Hellsgate to be unsuitable for capturing both G. brevipalpis and G. austeni. Some new trap designs and many modifications of these were tested, most of which were unsuccessful. The odour-baited blue and black H trap represents a different approach for trapping tsetse flies as it is fitted with lateral cones of white netting which induce the flies to take a more horizontal flight path once they have entered the trap, instead of the vertical flight paths they assume in existing tsetse fly traps. A number of modifications of the prototype H trap were devised (H 1 -H 5), before the final design was <b>established.</b> <b>Catches</b> of up to 76 G. brevipalpis and 37 G. austeni were obtained per trap on a single day with the H 3 modification. Further modifications improved on the trap's efficiency to capture G. brevipalpis and G. austeni. The final modification caught a record number of 180 G. brevipalpis and 57 G. austeni on a single day. The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{examines}} how {{the requirement for}} annual catch limits (ACLs) has been implemented for data-limited stocks in all federally-managed fisheries in the United States. The legal mandate to establish ACLs in the U. S. has spurred substantial scientific advances, including the development and adoption of at least 16 methods for <b>establishing</b> <b>catch</b> limits for data-limited fisheries. This study analyzed the assessment methods that {{form the basis of}} ACLs, those which determine the overfishing limits (OFLs) and the acceptable biological catches (ABCs). Nationally, 30 % (150) of OFLs/ABCs are currently calculated using conventional data-rich assessment methods, 11 % (59) using data-moderate methods, and 59 % (295) using data-poor approaches. There is substantial variation in the proportion of stocks that are currently managed with data-rich versus data-limited methods across regions, and there are clear geographical patterns in the types and diversity of methods being utilized to calculate OFLs/ABCs. Data-poor methods are the most commonly used OFL/ABC-setting methods in the U. S., particularly in the Southeast, Atlantic highly migratory species (HMS), Pacific, and Western Pacific regions. The Southeast and Atlantic HMS regions use some form of catch scalar or an ABC of zero landings for each data-limited stock. The Pacific and North Pacific regions currently employ a higher diversity of data-limited methods than any other region; these include both data-moderate methods and data-poor methods. Regional disparities in data-limited method development and implementation are attributed to regional differences in the number of stocks being managed, the data types and lengths of the time series available, and the resources dedicated to data processing and stock assessment. Recommendations for improving management of data-limited stocks include establishing a complete inventory of all available data for each managed stock, dedicating resources and expertise to data-limited method development and evaluation, and developing a more streamlined assessment process to handle the expanded volume of stocks requiring ACLs...|$|R

40|$|Nitrogen {{leaching}} during autumn {{and winter}} after establishment of winter oil-seed rape (Brassica napus L.) in Sweden is usually relatively high. The reasons {{are most likely}} the tillage operations {{that need to be}} carried out in summer and the common use of fertilizer nitrogen at establishment. To reduce these negative effects of tillage and fertilizers when growing winter rape, the possibility to establish Winter rape by direct drilling into growing ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.) or white clover (Trifolium repens L.) was evaluated in a field experiment at Lönnstorp, Skåne. On a morainic clay loam, autumn mould board ploughing followed by conventional seedbed preparation and sowing was compared with direct drilling into barley stubble, and with direct drilling into the growing <b>catch</b> crop, previously <b>established</b> in spring barley (Hordeum vulgare L.). Throughout the experiment, 48 cm row spacing was used for the rape. The tillage treatments were combined with nitrogen fertilizer strategies, with or without 40 kg N ha- 1 in autumn at establishment. Where nitrogen was added in the autumn, the amount of fertilizer added in spring was reduced with the same amount. In spring, only the treatments without a catch crop were inter-row weeded because of too vigorously developed ryegrass and white clover, and weeding was therefore not possible to carry out in these treatments. Direct drilling of winter rape was successful compared to conventional tillage, even though the mean root neck diameter of oil seed rape in November was small and the over-wintering was poor There was no yield of oil seed rape when it was sown into growing ryegrass due to poor establishment of the rape and poor overwintering.

Zooarchaeological evidence shows that the clearest changes in marine fishing in England between AD 600 and 1600 occurred rapidly around AD 1000 and involved large increases in catches of herring and cod. Surprisingly, this revolution predated the documented post-medieval expansion of England's sea fisheries and coincided with the Medieval Warm Period [...] when natural herring and cod productivity was probably low in the North Sea. This counterintuitive discovery can be explained by the concurrent rise of urbanism and human impacts on freshwater ecosystems. The search for 'pristine' baselines regarding marine ecosystems will thus need to employ medieval palaeoecological proxies in addition to recent fisheries data and early modern historical records...|$|R

Existing and new legal mandates, {{such as the}} requirement to <b>establish</b> Annual <b>Catch</b> Limits for each United States fishery by 2011, {{as well as the}} ongoing need to improve understanding of fish stock dynamics, are driving efforts to develop new, more efficient ways to assess fish stocks when resources are insufficient for full stock assessments. Moreover, there is an increasing recognition of the need to assess stocks at smaller spatial scales. In December 2008, fishery scientists, fishermen, and managers convened at a workshop in Berkeley, California (USA), to discuss such methods. One goal of the workshop was to identify methods for estimating potential reference points for managing data-poor fisheries, such as science-based overfishing thresholds, allowable biological catch levels, and vulnerability indices. Here we review methods presented at the workshop, as well as some promising methods gleaned from the literature, for establishing reference points for data-poor situations. We present a new framework to help managers and stakeholders consider and choose appropriate analytical methods and alternative management approaches, based on avail-able data (type, quantity, and quality) and feasibility constraints (scale, value, and implementation costs).

Three alternative methods to establish the ABC control rule are considered: (1) a constant buffer approach where the ABC for each stock would be set by application of a constant pre-specified buffer value below the OFL; (2) a variable buffer approach where the ABC would be annually calculated from a prespecified percentile of the distribution for the OFL (noted as P*) and using a probability distribution for the OFL that accounts for scientific uncertainty in the estimate of OFL and any other specified scientific uncertainty; and (3) a blended approach that uses a variable buffer for stocks in Tiers 1 through 4 and a constant buffer for stocks in Tier 5.

For important fish species like Atlantic salmon, this could have large implications for their conservation and management. Most salmon rivers are managed by specifying an angling season of predetermined length based on population demography, which is typically <b>established</b> from <b>catch</b> statistics. Given the circularity of using catch statistics to estimate demographic parameters, {{it may be difficult}} to quantify the selective nature of angling and its evolutionary impact. In the River Etne in Norway, a recently installed trap permits daily sampling of fish entering the river, some of which are subsequently captured by anglers upstream. Here, we used 31 microsatellites to establish an individual DNA profile for salmon entering the trap, and for many of those subsequently captured by anglers. These data permitted us to investigate time of rod capture relative to river entry, potential body size-selective harvest, and environmental variables associated with river entry. Larger, older fish entered the river earlier than smaller, younger fish of both sexes, and larger, older females were more abundant than males and vice versa. There was good agreement between the sizes of fish harvested by angling, and the size distribution of the population sampled on the trap. These results demonstrate that at least in this river, and with the current timing of the season, the angling catch reflects the population's demographics and there is no evidence of size-selective harvest. We also demonstrated that the probability of being caught by angling declines quickly after river entry. Collectively, these data indicate that that the timing of the fishing season, in relation to the upstream migration patterns of the different demographics of the population, likely represents the most significant directional evolutionary force imposed by angling...|$|R

Size at first maturity (L 50) was estimated at 16. 86 and 18. 55 cm for females and males, respectively. The total fecundity ranged between 17, 816 and 120, 333 mature oocytes per female and relative fecundity was 235 ± 63 oocyte. g− 1 whereas batch fecundity varied between 20 and 25 % from total fecundity. Since the species is widely caught, we suggest a closed season from March to May and to <b>establish</b> a minimum <b>catch</b> size of 18. 5 cm for both sexes, since there is no evident sexual dimorphism...|$|R
50|$|In 1928 Salvesen left Oxford {{to enter}} the family business, {{alongside}} his brothers Noel and Norman and his cousin Iver. The work was divided among the partners, with Norman responsible for chartering and agency work and Iver handling merchant shipping. Noel, with his father Theodore, headed the whaling division, which Harold joined. After learning Norwegian - the universal language among the whalers - he spent the summers of 1928/29 and 1929/30 in the Antarctic, the first senior manager to actually visit the Southern Ocean whaling fleet, and came back arguing strongly for more investment and more modern practices. He oversaw the conversion of two factory ships for pelagic whaling, Salvestria and Sourabaya, and brought a new zeal and efficiency to the operations at South Georgia and at sea. The boom in Antarctic whaling {{came to an abrupt}} halt in 1930/31, with the price of oil dropping by half, and over the following years Salvesen was a leading player in the negotiations to <b>establish</b> an agreed <b>catch</b> quota among the whaling firms. His major achievement was to set the quota in terms of whales killed rather than oil produced, encouraging a less wasteful approach to whaling.|$|R
