DNA sensors have been of interest as an analytical tool to test for specific gene sequences. Conventional DNA sensors have used a gold surface layer to immobilize lipid-functionalized probes containing single-strand DNA. The electrical properties of these early devices are known and have been implemented to determine if a genetic match occurred. The goal of this project is to develop a new DNA sensor using perovskite materials. In this investigation a DNA sensor was built where the DNA probe strand is immobilized on the SDS/BST/p-GaAs surface. The sensor is composed of a p-doped gallium arsenide (GaAs) substrate, a perovskite dielectric layer composed of barium strontium titanate (BST) and a polar binding layer consisting of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS). The SDS is a polar lipid that binds to a functionalized DNA probe strand. The SDS binding was verified using electrical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (ATR). FTIR was used to detect the presence of immobilized DNA on the SDS layer; however, <b>direct</b> <b>capacitance</b> measurements serve as a reliable method to verify the binding. The DNA sensor works as follows: the probe that contains the DNA single strand can only bind to the complimentary DNA target strand.

40|$|A {{high-resolution}} capacitive sensing {{technique is}} presented in this thesis: the Resonant Double Gate Transistor (RDGT). The major advantage of the RDGT compared to "pure" capacitive sensing techniques is its low output impedance because of the <b>direct</b> <b>capacitance</b> to current conversion of the transistor. The important difference between the Resonant Gate Transistors (RGT) reported earlier and the RDGT is {{that in addition to}} the oscillating gate there is also a fixed gate. The additional gate provides long- term stability and makes possible a choice of the working point of the transistor independent of the bias applied to the oscillating gate. According to simulations the RDGT provides a spatial resolution of the order of 10 - 13 m Hz - 1 / 2 with an air gap of 2 µm and a DC voltage of 10 V on the oscillating gate. First measurements on fabricated RDGT´s resulted in a spatial resolution of 2 x 10 - 11 m Hz - 1 / 2. Oxygen plasma assisted wafer bonding is evaluated as a tool for integrating micromechanics with electronics such as the RDGT. Our oxygen plasma enhanced wafer bonding using ICP RIE results in high surface energies after storage for 24 hours at room temperature. The surface energies achieved are comparable to the surface energies obtained when wet chemical cleaned and bonded wafers are annealed at 800 °C. Investigations were carried out to understand the plasma assisted bonding mechanism. We propose that a porous silica network resulting from the plasma treatment makes faster diffusion of water through a porous network possible. This makes it easier for hydroxyl groups to come into contact for reaction, which gradually increases the surface energy at room temperature. The first electrical characterisation of ASIC´s with standard electronic components and circuits after oxygen plasma treatment using an ICP RIE showed no degradation of their performance. Based on the measurement results it is very likely that our oxygen plasma assisted room temperature bonding is CMOS compatible.

40|$|Thermal {{transport}} in low-dimensional {{structure has}} attracted tremendous attentions because micro/nanoscale materials play crucial roles in advancing micro/nanoelectronics industry. The thermal properties {{are essential for}} understanding of the energy conversion and thermal management. To better investigate micro/nanoscale materials and characterize the thermal transport, pulse laser-assisted thermal relaxation 2 (PLTR 2) and transient electrothermal (TET) are both employed to determine thermal property of various forms of materials, including thin films and nanowires. As conducting polymer, Poly(3 -hexylthiophene) (P 3 HT) thin film is studied to understand its thermal properties variation with P 3 HT weight percentage. 4 P 3 HT solutions of different weight percentages are compounded to fabricate thin films using spin-coating technique. Experimental results indicate that weight percentage exhibits impact on thermophysical properties. When percentage changes from 2 % to 7 %, thermal conductivity varies from 1. 29 to 1. 67 W/m*K and thermal diffusivity decreases from 10 - 6 to 5 × 10 - 7 m 2 /s. Moreover, PLTR 2 technique is applied to characterize the three-dimensional anisotropic thermal properties in spin-coated P 3 HT thin films. Raman spectra verify that the thin films embrace partially orientated P 3 HT molecular chains, leading to anisotropic thermal transport. Among all three directions, lowest thermal property is observed along out-of-plane direction. For in-plane characterization, anisotropic ratio is around 2 to 3, indicating that {{the orientation of the}} molecular chains has strong impact on the thermal transport along different directions. Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) thin film is synthesized by electrospinning features porous structure composed by TiO 2 nanowires with random orientations. The porous structure caused significant degradation of thermal properties.

30|$|High-performance {{supercapacitor}} electrodes {{should have}} high-rate performance. Variations in specific capacitances of symmetric supercapacitors {{based on the}} calcined samples with increase in current density are shown in Fig.  7 c. In general, at lower current densities (from 0.25 to 2  A/g), the specific capacitance decreases {{with the increase in}} discharge current density; it may be caused by the internal resistance of the electrode. At an extremely low current density of 0.25  A/g, the maximum specific capacitance values for the supercapacitors based on samples with calcination temperatures 200, 225, 250 and 300  °C, respectively, are 372, 524, 716 and 621  F/g. At lower current densities, ions can penetrate into the inner structure of electrode material having access to almost all available pores of the electrode, but at higher current densities an effective utilization of the material is limited only to the outer surface of electrodes. It results in the reduction of specific capacitance values. At current densities above 2  A/g, specific capacitance tends to stabilize. The sample calcined at 250  °C retains more than 83  % of its capacitance (605  F/g at a low current density of 1  A/g) retention even when the current density increases as high as 25  A/g, indicating the relatively good high-rate capability. The sample calcined at 300  °C is also able to retain 79  % of its capacitance at a high current density of 25  A/g. But samples calcined at 200 and 225  °C are able to retain only 60 and 65  % of their capacitance, due to the incomplete formation of nanocrystallites and mesopores. Cycle life is another important factor for evaluating the performance of a supercapacitor. Cyclic stability curves for symmetric supercapacitors at a constant current density of 1  A/g are illustrated in Fig.  7 d. For samples annealed at 250 and 300  °C, the specific capacitance increases gradually at the beginning of cycles and then there is a slight decrease. This phenomenon indicates that there is an initial activation process for Faradaic pseudocapacitance of mesoporous Co 3 O 4. During the first 500 cycles, the specific capacitance of the sample annealed at 250  °C increases from 605 to 625  F/g and that of Co 3 O 4 nanowires with flower-like morphology increases from 509 to 520  F/g. For the samples annealed at 250 and 300  °C, the specific capacitance slowly decreases with increase in cycle numbers. At the end of 5, 000 cycles, supercapacitors based on samples with calcination temperatures 200, 225, 250 and 300  °C retain, respectively, 80, 85, 97 and 93  % of their maximum <b>capacitance.</b> <b>Direct</b> growth of 1 -D Co 3 O 4 nanostructures on carbon substrates and the self-organization of nanostructures into flower-like microarchitectures also have dramatic impact on supercapacitor performance, as each nanostructure will be electronically attached to the current collector which in turn will reduce the internal resistance of the electrode facilitating the rapid transport of the electrolyte ions and increasing the electrochemical utilization and pseudocapacitive performance of Co 3 O 4.|$|R
