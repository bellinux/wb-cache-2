40|$|Abstract Essentials Between-lab {{variations}} of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> in lupus anticoagulant detection are unknown. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were calculated in 11 labs each testing plasma from 120 donors with 3 platforms. Major variation was observed {{even within the}} same platform. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> determined in different labs are not interchangeable. SUMMARY: Background <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for interpretation of lupus anticoagulant (LA) detection are poorly investigated. Aims (i) To assess whether results from healthy donors were normally distributed and (ii) the between-laboratories differences in <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for screening, mixing and LA confirmation when calculated as 99 th or 95 th centiles, and (iii) to assess {{their impact on the}} detection rate for LA. Methods Each of 11 laboratories using one of the three widely used commercial platforms for LA detection was asked to collect plasmas from 120 healthy donors and to perform screening, mixing and LA confirmation with two methods (activated partial thromboplastin time [APTT] and dilute Russell viper venom [dRVV]). A common set of LA-positive or LA-negative freeze-dried plasmas was used to assess the LA detection rate. Results were centralized (Milano) for statistical analysis. Results and conclusions (i) Clotting times or ratios for healthy subjects were not normally distributed in the majority of cases. The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> should be determined preferably by the non-parametric method based on centiles. (ii) There were relatively large inter-laboratory cut-off variations even within the same platform and the variability was marginally attenuated when results were expressed as ratios (test-to-normal pooled plasma). The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> should be determined locally. (iii) There were differences between <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> calculated as 99 th or 95 th centiles that translate into a different LA detection rate (the lower the centile the greater the detection rate). The take-home message is that <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> determined as the 95 th centile allow a better LA detection rate...|$|R
40|$|Background: Clinical {{breakpoints}} and epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for N. gonorrhoeae azithromycin {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} {{have not}} been established. This study utilized existing minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) data from CDC’s Gonococcal Isolate Surveillance Project (GISP) to establish epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for azithromycin and N. gonorrhoeae as determined by agar dilution. Methods: MIC distributions for the pooled dataset and each data year (2005 - 2012) were constructed. Epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were calculated using two methods. Method 1 considers the wild-type MIC distribution, the modal MIC for the distribution, and the inherent variability of the test (± 1 twofold-dilution). Method 2 defines the epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> as two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50. Results: Taking into consideration the wild-type MIC distributions and the inherent variability of the test, the epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> chosen for the pooled dataset and each data year using Method 1 was ≤ 1. 0 µg/mL. The MIC 50 for the pooled dataset and each data year was 0. 25 µg/mL. Two twofold-dilutions higher than the MIC 50 (0. 25 µg/mL) for the pooled dataset and each data year was 1. 0 µg/mL. Discussion: The epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> chosen using Methods 1 and 2 (≤ 1. 0 µg/mL) were identical for the pooled dataset and each data year, indicating the epidemiological <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> has not changed from 2005 - 2012.

This study determines the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for the obesity indices that represent elevated incidence of hypertension in 18 - 65 -year-old Chinese adults using data from the China Health and Nutrition Survey (CHNS) 2006 - 2011 prospective cohort. Individual body mass index (BMI), waist circumference (WC), waist:hip ratio (WHR) and waist:stature ratio (WSR) were assessed. ROC curves for these obesity indices were plotted to estimate and compare the usefulness of these obesity indices and the corresponding values for the maximum of the Youden indices were considered the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Five-year cumulative incidences of hypertension were 21. 5 % (95 % CI: 19. 4 - 23. 6) in men and 16. 5 % (95 % CI: 14. 7 - 18. 2) in women, and there was a significant trend of increased incidence of hypertension with an increase in BMI, WC, WHR or WSR (P for trend < 0. 001) in both men and women. The Youden index indicated that the optimal BMI, WC, WHR, WSR <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were 23. 53 kg/m 2, 83. 7 cm, 0. 90, and 0. 51 among men.

BackgroundThe {{aim of this}} study was to define <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for serum creatinine as an indicator of several levels of renal impairment. MethodsTo identify the suitable values, receiver operating characteristic curves were constructed based on the data of 984 laboratory assessments of renal function. The glomerular filtration rate was measured with inulin clearance. Three levels of renal impairment were analyzed. An index that gave the same weight to false positive and false negative results was used to determine the thresholds. Robustness of the results was tested using a “bootstrap” technique. ResultsConsidering an inulin clearance of less than 80 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for serum creatinine was 115 μmol/liter for men and 90 μmol/liter for women. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for a clearance of less than 60 ml/min/ 1. 73 m 2 was 137 μmol/liter for men and 104 μmol/liter for women.

40|$|Objective　To {{explore the}} {{potential}} influence of gender on screening value of aldosterone-renin ratio (ARR) for primary aldosteronism (PA). Methods　The biochemical parameters were collected of 451 PA patients and 300 essential hypertension (EH) {{patients who were}} diagnosed in the General Hospital of PLA from 1992 to 2014. Each group was then {{divided into two groups}} by gender. The clinical characteristics were compared and then the receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) was conducted to evaluate the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> Results　The plasma aldosterone concentration (PAC), serum sodium and ARR were much higher, but the plasma rennin activity (PRA), serum potassium and BMI were much lower in PA patients than in EH patients (P 0. 05). The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in male PA patients was 19. 11, the relevant area under the curve (AUC) was 0. 968, the sensitivity and specificity was 92. 44 % and 93. 08 %, and the Youden index (YI) was 0. 86. The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in female PA patients was 27. 26, with AUC 0. 956, sensitivity 92. 07 %, specificity 90. 00 % and YI 0. 82, respectively. If the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> was set at 27. 26 in males, the specificity would rise a little, but the sensitivity and YI would sharply decrease. Similarly, the sensitivity would increase a little but the specificity and YI would fall substantially if the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> in females was set at 19. 11. The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of ARR in men was smaller than the official value recommended by guidelines.

Material and Methods: One-hundred and one subjects (55 SpA patients and 46 age and body mass index ((BMI) -matched healthy controls (HC)) were investigated. US was performed using a MyLab 70 US system (Esaote Biomedica, Genoa, Italy) with a linear probe (6 - 18 MHz). Three images per Achilles enthesis were stored and the antero-posterior thickness of the enthesis was measured {{at the level of}} the Achilles tendon deeper margin insertion into the calcaneal bone on the longitudinal median scan. The best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for each gender was determined by ROC curve analysis and compared to the other <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> in the literature: 1) 5. 29 mm for both genders, and 2) 5. 5 mm for females and 6. 2 mm for males. The number of measurements exceeding the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> as well as sensitivity (SE), specificity (SP), positive (PPV) and negative (NPV) predictive values were calculated. Results: A significant difference was observed for Achilles enthesis thickness between genders (mean±SD: 4. 6 ± 0. 7 mm in males vs. 4. 0 ± 0. 8 mm in females, p< 0. 00) and between SpA patients and HC (mean±SD: 4. 4 ± 0. 8 mm in SpA patients vs. 4. 0 ± 0. 8 mm in HC, p< 0. 001). The ROC curve analysis revealed the best <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> to be 3. 7 mm for females and 4. 8 mm for males (SE: 43 - 70 %, SP: 59 - 85 %, PPV: 66 - 79 %, NPV: 54 - 63 %). Previously reported <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were found to have high SP (91 - 98 %) but very low SE (2 - 11 %).

It is unknown whether this protocol has been adopted in sarcopenia research and practice. The aim {{of the study was}} to provide insight into current measurement practice, including the use of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for low muscle strength. Methods: A systematic review of the literature was conducted, followed by a methodological quality assessment and extraction of relevant data. Inclusion criteria included a description of the grip strength protocol, EWGSOP standards were used to define sarcopenia, data was collected after 2010 and participants were 65 years and older. Results: Twenty-seven observational papers were included in the review. The methodological quality was acceptable/good. Overall, information about the protocol was limited with a large variability in measurement approach. Most non-Asian studies used <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for low grip strength of 30 kg for men and 20 kg for women. Asian studies showed more variability in choice of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Discussion: The proposed grip strength measurement protocol has been poorly adopted since its publication. Although there seems to be some agreement on <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> in non-Asian studies, proposed <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> need to be evaluated in specific diseases and settings and its predictive abilities regarding outcomes such as mobility limitations and falls needs to be determined. Asian research on <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> is still ongoing. © 2015 Elsevier Masson SAS and European Union Geriatric Medicine Society. All rights reserved. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|In a {{perspective}} of economic constraints the prioritizing of patients to IFN-free regimens is mainly {{based on the}} determination of liver stiffness by transient elastography (TE). Being a continuous variable the interpretation of TE results requires the identification of <b>cut-off</b> <b>values,</b> to date set to maximize diagnostic accuracy even if such values should be better based on more helpful outcome prediction endpoints. To define the TE <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> in different clinical scenarios, including new IFN-free regimens, and to balance the clinical benefits versus harms in treated and untreated patients. We assessed the accuracy of TE in staging 728 consecutive HCV patients {{and the distribution of}} TE values in 1, 001 blood donors. Ten experts quantified the expected harm/benefit ratio for 6 scenarios resulting from 2 stages of liver disease (F≥ 2 or F≥ 3) and 3 treatment regimens: PEGIFN+ribavirin, PEGIFN+RBV+first-generation protease inhibitor, and IFN-free regimens. The optimal TE <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were identified using the Metz equation. The estimated mean expected harm/benefit ratio for IFN-free regimens was 1 / 8. 3 in patients with F≥ 2 and 1 / 10 in those with F≥ 3. The resulting optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were respectively 4. 5 kPa with sensitivity at 99 % and specificity at 12 %, and 6. 8 kPa with sensitivity at 94 % and specificity at 41 %. These <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> are lower than those maximizing accuracy and allow {{to reduce the number of}} false negative results. The optimal TE <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> to prioritize patients for IFN-free regimens, are sensibly lower than those used to maximize diagnostic accuracy...|$|R

This value is compared to a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> Results below the value {{are assumed to be}} negative, those above positive. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> itself is determined by comparing the results of patients with two or more different detection methods.

40|$|The GOLD Guidelines {{propose to}} define airways {{obstruction}} using a fixed <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> 70 % for the FEV 1 /FVC ratio. The predicted FEV 1 /FVC ratio and its LLN are, however, {{highly dependent on}} age. As a consequence, {{the use of a}} fixed <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> may lead to overdiagnosis of airways obstruction, especially in an older population. The use of a fixed <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> may also lead to an under-diagnosis of asthma and other obstructive disorders in a younger population. In order to make the interpretation of pulmonary function test easier, the LLN should be systematically mentioned on the report.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was the {{detection}} of Dictyocaulus viviparus carriers in Dutch dairy herds by use of a serum ELISA of bulk-milk ELISA, from April until June 2011. The used ELISA from Hannover is based on a MSP antigen and was compered with the ELISA from Deventer witch is based on a native lungworm antigen. Induvidual feces samples were collected from dairy cows and evaluated with the Baermann method. From positive dairy herd were blood samples taken for the serum ELISA from positve and negative cows. From the 23 dairy herds were 12 herds positive with the Baermann method (52, 2 %; 95 %-CI: 31, 8 - 72, 6 %). The results from the bulk-milk ELISA from Hannover were all negative by a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 49, 3 %. The bulk-milk ELISA from Deventer had a prevalence of 60, 9 % (95 %-CI: 40, 9 - 80, 8 %), a sensitivity of 91, 7 % and a specificity of 72, 7 %, by a <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 7 %. The <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of 10 % had a prevalence of 26, 1 % (95 %-CI: 8, 1 %- 44, 0 %), a sensitivity of 50 % and a specificity of 100 %. 46 positive and 118 negative cows were evaluated with the serum ELISA. The serum ELISA from Hannover had a sensitivity of 58, 7 % and a specificity of 94, 9 % (<b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> 49, 3 %). The serum ELISA from Deventer had a sensitivity of 28, 3 % and a specificity of 94, 9 % (<b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> 30 %). These results were compared to the earlier results when dairy herds with and without lungworm outbreaks were evalueted (August-October 2010) and dairy herds with carriers (January-March 2011). The ELISA's could be a usefull contribution in the diagnostics of lungworm carriers, if the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> are adapted. Different <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for the ELISA's should be used with lungworm outbreaks or detection of carriers, to realise an optimal sensitvity and specificity...|$|R
40|$|Abdominal {{obesity is}} {{a risk factor for}} cardiometabolic disease, and has become a major public health problem in the world. Waist {{circumference}} is generally used as a simple surrogate marker to define abdominal obesity for population screening. An increasing number of publications solely rely on the method that maximises sensitivity and specificity to define ‘optimal’ <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> It is well documented that the optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of waist circumference vary across different ethnicities. However, it is not clear if the variation in <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> is a true biological phenomenon or an artifact of the method for identifying optimal cut-off points. The objective of the present review was to assess the relationship between optimal cut-offs and population waist circumference levels. Among sixty-one research papers, optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> ranged from 65 · 5 to 101 · 2 cm for women and 72 · 5 to 103 · 0 cm for men. Reported optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> were highly correlated with population means (correlation coefficient: 0 · 91 for men and 0 · 93 for women). Such a strong association was independent of waist circumference measurement techniques or the health outcomes (dyslipidaemia, hypertension or hyperglycaemia), and existed in some homogeneous populations such as the Chinese and Japanese. Our findings raised some concerns about applying the sensitivity and specificity approach to determine <b>cut-off</b> <b>values.</b> Further research is needed to understand whether the differences among populations in waist circumference were genetically or environmentally determined, and to understand whether using region-specific cut-off points can identify individuals with the same absolute risk levels of metabolic and cardiovascular outcomes among different populations. © 2010 The Authors...|$|R
40|$|Obesity is {{associated}} with increased cardiovascular risk. Anthropometric <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> derived for Caucasians may not be applicable to other populations. The main objective {{of the present study}} was to derive population-specific anthropometric <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> to define high CVD risk for Sri Lankan adults. A nationally representative sample of 4474 non-institutionalised adults aged ≥  18 years was analysed. <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> to provide optimum sensitivity and specificity were derived using receiver-operating characteristic curve analysis. BMI, waist circumference (WC), waist-to-hip ratio (WHR), blood pressure and overnight fasting venous blood samples were collected to measure glucose, HDL-cholesterol and TAG. An oral glucose tolerance test was also performed. The results suggested that the age-adjusted BMI, WC and WHR were significantly associated with all cardiovascular risk factors (P <  0 · 001). <b>Cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for BMI, WC and WHR for males were 20 · 7  kg/m 2, 76 · 5  cm and 0 · 89, respectively. The respective values for females were 22 · 0  kg/m 2, 76 · 3  cm and 0 · 85. The common <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> for BMI for males and females was 21 · 5  kg/m 2. Similarly, WC and WHR <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> for both males and females were 76 · 3  cm and 0 · 87, respectively. The Asian and Caucasian anthropometric cut-off levels showed lower sensitivity and higher false negative percentage compared with newly derived cut-off levels. In conclusion, BMI, WC and WHR were all associated with increased CVD risk. We propose the following anthropometric cut-off points to determine high CVD risk level for Sri Lankan adults: BMI ≥  21 · 5  kg/m 2, WC ≥  76  cm and WHR ≥  0 · 85 (women) and 0 · 90 (men) ...|$|R
40|$|Background D-dimer {{testing to}} rule out deep vein {{thrombosis}} is less useful in older patients because of a lower specificity. An age-adjusted D-dimer <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> increased the proportion of older patients (> 50 years) in whom pulmonary embolism could be excluded. We retrospectively validated the efficacy of this cut-off combined with clinical probability for the exclusion of deep vein thrombosis. Design and Methods Five management study cohorts of 2818 consecutive outpatients with suspected deep vein thrombosis were used. Patients with non-high or unlikely probability of deep vein thrombosis {{were included in the}} analysis; four different D-dimer tests were used. The proportion of patients with a normal D-dimer test and the failure rates were calculated using the conventional (500 mg/L) and the age-adjusted D-dimer cut-off (patient's age x 10 mg/L in patients > 50 years). Results In 1672 patients with non-high probability, deep vein thrombosis could be excluded in 850 (51 %) patients with the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> versus 707 (42 %) patients with the conventional <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> The failure rates were 7 (0. 8; 95 % confidence interval 0. 3 - 1. 7 %) for the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> and 5 (0. 7 %, 0. 2 - 1. 6 %) for the conventional <b>cut-off</b> <b>value.</b> The absolute increase in patients in whom deep vein thrombosis could be ruled out using the age-adjusted <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> was largest in patients > 70 years: 19 % among patients with non-high probability. Conclusions The age-adjusted cut-off of the D-dimer combined with clinical probability greatly increases the proportion of older patients in whom deep vein thrombosis can be safely exclude...|$|R
40|$|Background: Serum tumor markers (TMs) were seldom {{reported}} in esophageal carcinoma (ESCC), {{and the results}} were still unsatisfactory. Materials and Methods: We retrospectively analyzed carcinoembryonic antigen, CA 125, CA 199, CA 724 and CA 242 in ESCC patients. The preliminary relations between serum TMs and clinicopathological factors or prognosis were analyzed by Fisher′s exact test and Kaplan-Meier method firstly. Then, the <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of these serum TMs were delimited according to lymph node metastasis, hematogenic metastasis and 2 -year survival or 5 -year survival of ESCC by receiver operating characteristic curve. Based on these <b>cut-off</b> <b>values,</b> the relations between the serum TMs and clinicopathological factors or prognosis were analyzed again. Univariate and multivariate analyses of Cox regression proportional hazard model were performed to evaluate the prognostic parameters for survival. Results: We chose 13. 65 U/mL, 9. 945 U/mL and 6. 25 U/mL as new <b>cut-off</b> <b>values</b> of CA 125, CA 199 and CA 724, respectively, and chose 25. 35 U/mL as the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> of CA 125 for ESCC hematogenous metastasis. with these optimal <b>cut-off</b> <b>values,</b> CA 199, CA 125 and CA 724 were associated with ESCC hematogenous metastasis, and CA 199 and CA 125 were associated with ESCC lymph node metastasis, but not associated with other clinicopathological factors. The prognosis was better in patients with CA 125 ≤ 13. 65 U/mL than those with CA 125 > 13. 65 U/mL. Vascular tumor thrombus, grading, T grade, lymph node metastasis and CA 125 were independent prognostic factors. Conclusion: CA 125 could predict lymph node metastasis, hematogenic metastasis and prognosis with the <b>cut-off</b> <b>value</b> 13. 65 U/mL...|$|R
