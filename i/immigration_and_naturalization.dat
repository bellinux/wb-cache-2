40|$|This paper {{shows that}} the {{availability}} of dual citizenship, or here Overseas Citizenship of India (OCI), leads to higher naturalization rates {{in the country of}} residence. The analysis is based on three distinct naturalization rates, calculated on the basis of annual <b>immigration</b> flows <b>and</b> <b>naturalizations</b> seven years later; the resident population eligible for naturalization; <b>and</b> <b>naturalization</b> records for specific immigrant cohorts. To isolate effects specific to India as the country of origin from general factors in the U. S., the development of naturalization rates for Indian, or India-born, immigrants is juxtaposed with the respective rates for all Asian immigrants to the U. S. and for all immigrants to the U. S. as comparison groups. Contextualizing the naturalization decision, considering factors in the country of origin, destination, {{as well as in the}} migrant community alike, the paper finds that, depending on the metric used, the naturalization rate of Indian immigrants grew stronger than that of the chosen comparison groups by 2 to 12. 8 percentage points...|$|R

50|$|Almost immediately, the {{provisions}} of the law were challenged by Southwestern businesses. US entry into World War I, {{a few months after the}} law's passage, prompted a waiver of the Act's provisions on Mexican agricultural workers. It was soon extended to include Mexicans working in the mining and railroad industries and the exemptions continued through 1921. The Chinese Exclusion Act was repealed in 1943. The Luce-Celler Act of 1946 ended discrimination against Asian Indians and Filipinos, who were accorded the right to <b>naturalization,</b> <b>and</b> allowed a quota of 100 immigrants per year. The Immigration Act of 1917 was later altered formally by the <b>Immigration</b> <b>and</b> Nationality Act of 1952, known as the McCarran-Walter Act.

40|$|The {{motivations and}} {{opportunities}} for immigrants to naturalize continuously change. During the 2006 nation- wide mobilizations against House of Representatives bill 4437 the message : "Ahora marchamos, mañana votamos" (Today we march, tomorrow we vote) was a common banner carried amongst the marchers in the streets. I examine {{the extent to which}} the mobilizations created an opportunity for Latinos in the U. S. to naturalize and their motivations for becoming United States citizens within the context of this renewed mobilization for immigration reform. This research focuses on Latinos who have become or are in the process of becoming naturalized U. S. citizens since the 2006 mobilizations and who participated in citizenship workshops in San Diego. I also provide a closer look at the current campaign to promote <b>immigration</b> reform <b>and</b> <b>naturalization</b> in order to see how the tactics activists are employing now are related to those developed or adopted in 2006. My analysis employs theories about citizenship as well as a social movements lens. Using both theoretical perspectives helps expand our understanding of naturalization embedded within the larger immigration reform movement in the United States. The final part of this thesis suggests future implications these movements may have for the political incorporation of Latinos within the political opportunity structure created by the mobilizations of 2006.

40|$|The {{years since}} German reunification have seen changes in {{ideologies}} and policies toward societal multilingualism, linguistic pluralism of linguistic minorities. These changes {{have responded to}} the increasing diversity of minority languages as a result of immigration from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and the subsequent expansion of the European Union. At the same time, the use of polylingualism or hybrid linguistic practices in everyday, informal contexts by both migrants and Germans has risen to public prominence. In contrast to the official policies that stress German-only education as the key to academic success and social integration, the (covert) prestige and use of languages other than German, especially Turkish, by members of other ethnic groups has been rising, and hybrid linguistic practices are gaining ground, particularly among youth. This paper examines the underlying ideologies, policies, and debates, especially with respect to the role of proficiency in German for adult <b>immigration,</b> <b>naturalization</b> <b>and</b> integration, as well as educational polices and practices for German and other languages...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} influence of neo-liberal discourses and strategies of governance on a revaluation of the national language, {{in the form of}} formalized requirements and testing of language proficiency, within <b>immigration,</b> integration, <b>naturalization,</b> <b>and</b> citizenship policy in Canada and the United Kingdom. Employing an interdiscursive language policy analysis (da Silva & Heller, 2009), the dissertation combines textual analysis of policy documents, informed by the principles of Critical Discourse Analysis (CDA), with an ethnographic understanding of the policy process gathered through interviews with policy actors. It applies the key CDA analytical categories of emergence, selection, operationalization, and materialization of discourses within domains of social action, and recontextualization of discourses across domains (Fairclough, 2009; Wodak & Fairclough, 2010) to a comparative case study of the policy processes surrounding language, <b>immigration,</b> <b>and</b> citizenship in Canada and the UK. The analysis of the cases reveals how neo-liberal discourses of the knowledge-based economy and communitarian discourses of cohesion and active citizenship have been recontextualized within the domains of <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> citizenship policy, ultimately constituting a similar hegemonic discourse on the importance of language skills in a common, national language for immigrant integration. Further, the operationalization and materialization of this discourse is interpreted, drawing on the field of governmentality studies, as instantiating an advanced liberal political rationality (Rose, 1996, 1999), with formal language requirements and tests serving as political technologies for the subjectivation of prospective citizens. It is also revealed, however, that contestation over, and contradictions within this neo-liberal strategy of governance have shaped the particular policies regarding language, <b>immigration,</b> <b>and</b> citizenship in each case. The dissertation contributes to the literature on language testing practices for <b>immigration</b> <b>and</b> citizenship by identifying the motivation for such practices in the political economy of contemporary globalization and neo-liberal state strategies for the governance of <b>immigration,</b> integration, <b>and</b> citizenship. It also contributes to the field of Language Policy and Planning (LPP) by suggesting a theoretical and methodological framework for the study of state language policies in a neo-liberal, post-national era...|$|R
