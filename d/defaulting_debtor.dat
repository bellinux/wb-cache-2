50|$|The former {{security}} was first {{created by the}} 1283 Statute of Merchants, or Statute of Acton Burnell (named after Acton Burnell in Shropshire, the place where Parliament met and passed the statute) and amplified by the 1285 Statute of Merchants 1285, whence its name, and the latter {{by an act of}} 1353, which provided that in every staple (i.e. public mart) the seal of the staple should be sufficient validity for a bond of record acknowledged and witnessed before the mayor of the staple. They were originally permitted only among traders, for the benefit of commerce, but afterwards extended by an act of Henry VIII (1532) to all subjects, whether traders or not. The creditor under either form of {{security was}} allowed to seize the goods and hold the lands of a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor</b> until satisfaction of his debt. While he held the lands he was termed tenant by statute merchant or by statute staple. In addition to the loss of his goods and lands the debtor was liable to be imprisoned.

40|$|The {{events from}} the 2007 - 2009 {{financial}} crisis have raised {{concerns that the}} failure of large financial institutions can lead to destabilizing fire sales of assets. The risk of fire sales is related to exemptions from bankruptcy's automatic stay provision enjoyed {{by a number of}} financial contracts, such as repo. An automatic stay prohibits collection actions by creditors against a bankrupt debtor or his property. It prevents a creditor from liquidating collateral of a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor</b> since collateral is a lien on the debtor's property. In this paper, we construct a model of repo transactions, and consider the effects of changing the bankruptcy rule regarding the automatic stay on the activity in repo and real investment markets. We find that exempting repos from the automatic stay is beneficial for creditors who that hold the borrowers' collateral. Although the exemption may increase the size of the repo market by enhancing the liquidity of collateral, it can also lead to subsequent damaging fire sales that are associated with reductions in real investment activity. Hence, policy makers face a trade-off between the benefits of investment activity and the benefits of liquid markets for collateral...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new framework for valuating corporate credit risk using a balance sheet approach. Debt {{held by a}} company can be broadly classified into two categories: short-term debt that must be repaid within {{a relatively short period}} of time and long-term debt whose maturity period is relatively long. The greater the proportion of short-term debt to total debt, the greater the company's short-term credit risk. However, many existing risk valuation models have been unable to analyze credit risk based on the composition of the maturity periods because they assume all bonds and debentures are due on the same date. In this paper, we develop a model capable of simultaneously measuring both short-term and long-term credit risks, in which the short-term credit risk increases with the proportion of short-term debt to total debt, by inputting data on the two types of debt separately. In the real world, a creditor often grants an extension of the repayment period to a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor</b> company. Our model assumes cases in which such extensions result in a rise in the price of bonds issued by the debtor company. When combined with the hypothesis that creditors maximize the overall value of their bond holdings, this model can provide varying degrees of credit risk depending on whether or not a company's provider of short-term and long-term credit is the same. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 5th century BC {{there was an}} {{increase}} in the problem of indebtedness due the appropriation of public land (ager publicus) by the rich landowners to expand their estates (which restricted the amount of land available to small farmers), Rome’s territory being attacked by neighbouring peoples and taxation. This also led to an increase in the problem of the abuse of <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtors.</b> Because of the absence of clearly defined laws and judicial procedures, the creditors could imprison and torture the debtors and, sometimes, sell them as slaves. This led to the First Plebeian Secession (494 BC), which was the start of the Conflict of the Orders.|$|R
50|$|The plebeians {{demanded the}} state to protect small farmers from the abuse of <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtors</b> by the creditors, who were the wealthy patrician landowners. When this was not forthcoming, they resorted to boycotting the levy. At that time the Roman army was a {{part-time}} militia of peasant farmers who were drafted each year for the military campaigning season {{and then went back}} to their farms. Refusing the call-up gave plebeians significant political leverage. When their demands were not met, on their return from a defensive military campaign the soldiers refused to obey orders and seceded to Mons Sacer, outside Rome. They threatened to stay there until their demands were met. There were negotiations and the secession ended.|$|R
40|$|The recent {{crisis in}} sub-prime {{mortgage}} lending in the US has highlighted {{the risks associated}} with borrowing money against the security of one?s home.

40|$|When a {{mortgagor}} is {{in default}} and the mortgagee wants {{to enforce the}} debt the National Credit Act (hereafter the NCA) may apply. A credit agreement may be enforced in court by a credit provider against a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor</b> only once the requirements of sections 129 and 130 of the NCA have been adhered to. If a mortgagor (who is a protected consumer {{in terms of the}} NCA) is in default, the mortgagee must deliver a section 129 (1) notice to the consumer, thereby drawing the default {{to the attention of the}} consumer. For a number of years there has been uncertainty about the interpretation of section 129 (1) and how it affects the execution procedure in the case of a mortgage bond over immovable property. The recent Constitutional Court judgment of Sebola v Standard Bank 2012 5 SA 142 (CC) overturns, to my mind, the more reasonable approach to such notices in Rossouw v Firstrand Bank Ltd (2010 6 SA 439 (SCA)). It was held in Sebola that before instituting action against a defaulting consumer, a credit provider must provide proof to the court that a section 129 (1) notice of default (i) has been despatched to the consumer's chosen address and (ii) that the notice reached the appropriate post office for delivery to the consumer, thereby coming to the attention of the consumer. In practical terms the credit provider must obtain a post-dispatch "track and trace" print-out from the website of the South African Post Office. There is now a much heavier burden on a bank to ensure that proper proof is provided that the notice was sent and delivered to the correct address. Consequently it places another hurdle in the path of a mortgagee who wishes to foreclose...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} economic effects {{of state and}} federal laws, commonly known as bankruptcy exemptions, which protect the assets of a debtor who defaults on his debts. Chapter 1 examines these laws {{in the context of the}} costly state verification literature. Chapter 2 uses cross-sectional and time series variation in these laws to improve upon a literature which asks: (1) Do larger exemptions lead to higher bankruptcy filing rates? and (2) Do larger exemptions affect the choice of bankruptcy chapter? Chapter 3 uses similar techniques to examine the effect of these laws on the home mortgage credit market. Chapter 1 demonstrates that because many exemptions may be waived through the use of secured credit, large exemptions, by themselves, do not necessarily lead to a sub-optimal contract. Chapter 2 finds that while the use of cross-sectional and time series variation leads to greater support for the proposition that larger exemptions lead to higher filing rates, this result is not as strong as one might expect. Several reasons are given for this result. Among the reasons not cited in the previous literature is the fact that many exemptions protect the assets of a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor</b> who does not file for bankruptcy and thus do not necessarily make bankruptcy relatively more attractive. In contrast to previous papers which examine credit generally, Chapter 3 finds that large homestead exemptions do not increase the probability of denial or the interest rate on home mortgage loans and may, in fact, reduce both of these variables. While personal property exemptions may lead to a higher probability of denial and increased interest rates, this effect does not appear to be economically significant. This conflict with the previous literature most likely stems from the seniority of the mortgage with respect to the home which insulates the mortgage from many of the adverse consequences of exemptions. ...|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical referencesThe {{status of}} a {{creditor}} has always been vitally important in South African law. Our law contains numerous provisions - amongst others in the law of insolvency - to protect creditor's rights, that is, the ability of creditors to collect from debtor s what they are owed. Traditionally secured creditors - that is, creditors who hold some form of real security for their claim - rank higher in priority {{when it comes to}} repayment of their claims by a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor,</b> both in individual and collective debt enforcement procedures, and as such are, {{in the vast majority of}} cases, able to recover full or at least partial repayment of their claims. Business rescue was introduced into South African l aw with the commencement of the Companies Act 71 of 2008, which became effective on 1 May 201 1. Business rescue is a relatively new collective debt enforcement mechanism applicable to corporate debtors. There has been considerable uncertainty with regards to the interpretation of some of its provisions, mainly due to important concepts and terms not being defined. This uncertainty has extended to the provisions dealing with the extension of finance to a corporate debtor after commencement of the business rescue proceedings (so-called 'post-commencement finance') and the ranking of priority of creditors of such corporate debtor during the business rescue proceedings. The dissertation firstly seeks to explain the concept of business rescue, with specific emphasis on post-commencement finance. The relevant provisions relating to post-commencement finance are interpreted along the lines of recent principles governing statutory interpretation. An apparent conflict in the interpretation of these provisions is identified through specific reference to the limited number of judicial pronouncements on this subject matter to date. In attempting to resolve the apparent conflict in the interpretation of the relevant provisions, the dissertation then briefly considers the background to business rescue in South Africa. The Companies Act itself is considered, with specific reference to its stated purpose and objects, along with a look at the historical development of the specific provisions in question. A brief review is then undertaken of the role and f unction of real security in a collectively debt enforcement procedure such as business rescue under South African law, with specific reference to the existing distribution rules in insolvency la w. A comparative review of relevant foreign jurisdictions is then carried out. The dissertation concludes with a suggested approach to the interpretation of the ranking of priorities under business rescue...|$|E
40|$|In most {{contemporary}} economies loan contracts that mandate exclusionary penalties such as imprisonment or other non-pecuniary punishments for <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtors</b> are illegal, {{despite the fact}} that in some cases contracting parties might gain by being able to use them.

We explore the ability of such externalities to account for these restrictions. We contrast exclusion with enforceable collateral seizure, a widespread feature of developed financial systems. We also consider "behavioral" agents who underestimate their chances of being punished, and show that overconfidence of this type is a less compelling justification for restrictions on exclusionary punishments than is often argued. ...|$|R

40|$|This {{contribution}} {{deals with}} the archives of Old Assyrian traders (originating from the city-state of Assur on the Tigris) from the first centuries of the second millennium BC, found in their houses in the lower town of the ancient Anatolian city of Kanesh, which is excavated since 1948 by Turkish archaeologists. The now more than 23. 000 cuneiform tablets discovered there, belonging to at least 60 different merchants’ archives, constitute the most detailed and extensive written evidence on overland trade before the early Middle Ages. After providing general information on the traders, their business and their archives (kept in sealed “strong-rooms”), a more detailed analysis is preceded (§ 2) by distinguishing the various situations in which traders {{lived and worked in}} Kanesh – seniors or young men, with or without their family, some also with a house in another trading town in Anatolia - and the impact this had on their relations with their mother-city and on the nature and number of written records in their archives. In § 3 a brief sketch is given of the self-governing, corporate Assyrian merchant community, called “kārum Kanesh” (its location and archives have not yet been discovered), run by its main members. As an extension of the government of the city of Assur and head of the colonial network in Anatolia it played a vital role in performing administrative (it kept accounts, organized general accounting sessions and could impose rules), commercial (organizing collective operations and dealing with the local palace and ruler) and judicial tasks (as court of law), whose impact on the activities of the traders is reflected by their archives. In § 4 the three main categories into which the records may be distinguished are described: a large variety of letters, legal documents (contracts and judicial records) and memorandums, lists and short notes, whose functions the long § 5 analyzes. Three functions, which may overlap, are distinguished. Firstly (§ 5. 1) as means of communication, mainly by letters, essential for the success of the caravan system and the contacts between people - relatives, business partners, authorities - in Assur and the colonies, notably with personnel and relatives traveling or temporarily settled elsewhere in Anatolia. Secondly (§ 5. 2) as aid to memory, letters, testimonies, memorandums and lists, {{to keep track of the}} many, often complex and valuable transactions, especially investments and credit operations, to monitor due dates and dun defaulting debtors. And thirdly (§ 5. 3) as evidence, especially “valid” records, that is those in sealed envelopes, both contracts and agreements and a variety of usually sworn depositions and testimonies, which resulted from and were used in private summonses, mediation, arbitration or formal lawsuits. The latter could take place in kārum Kanesh and in Assur, before the City Assembly, headed by the ruler of Assur, which resulted in verdicts and official letters. Credit operations in particular generated many evidentiary records, most of them in order to provide creditors with various securities and specific facilities, such as a “payment contract” (with a <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtor)</b> and a kind of “bearer’s cheques”. Paragraph 6 investigates the role of “copies” and “duplicates”, both of letters and “valid records”, made to serve multiple addressees of letters, to provide business partners and co-witnesses with essential data (e. g. to dun defaulting debtors and to prepare for lawsuits), and to keep evidence available when originals were sent overland. The final § 7 analyzes the various ways in which records were classified, by subject matter, persons involved, the nature of the texts (e. g. letters, debt-notes, and sealed or unsealed records), and stored in the archives. This was usually on shelves along the walls or in various types of frequently sealed containers (wooden boxes, baskets, leather bags and jars) or as sealed packets, whose contents could be identified by inscribed bullae that served as labels. Letters of absent traders who ask wives or friends to retrieve records from their archives and write about the transport of groups of tablets provide interesting information. Unfortunately the archaeological record about the discovery of the tablets usually is too general, because their exact find-spots and numbers are rarely mentioned, which makes it impossible to distinguish valid, current records, from old files, no longer in use and possibly stored in jars. The informative value of the bullae, often separated from the tablets to which they belonged and published separately, is also not exploited. The resulting picture, mainly based on the textual information, shows a rather practical way of classification in various types of easily distinguishable groups and files in different “containers”, but many details remain unclear...|$|E

40|$|The {{existence}} of sovereign debt {{relies on the}} ability of creditors to impose costs on <b>defaulting</b> <b>debtors.</b> In their seminal contribution Eaton and Gersovitz (1981) began the modern literature on sovereign debt by assuming that creditors could not impose sanctions but could exclude debtor countries from international capital markets. This piece was followed by a large literature that attempted to weaken its assumptions. However, as a result of changes in the law {{as well as from the}} development of new legal strategies, during the last thirty years the possibilities for creditor actions against sovereigns have improved significantly. This survey reviews the evidence from recent litigation practice and discusses whether this requires a change in our understanding of sovereign debt markets.

50|$|A debtor borrows $10,000 {{from a car}} {{dealership}} to purchase an automobile, using the automobile itself as collateral for the loan (in other words the dealership retains a right to repossess the automobile in the event the <b>debtor</b> <b>defaults</b> on the loan). The dealership makes this loan using an authenticated security agreement - a signed agreement giving the dealership the secured right to repossess {{the car in the}} event of <b>default</b> of the <b>debtor.</b> The debtor also has two unsecured creditors who have made loans of $1000 each to the debtor. Neither of these creditors has a security agreement - their only method of recovering their money in the event that the <b>debtor</b> <b>defaults</b> on the loan is through the judicial system, whereas the secured creditor can simply repossess the car at his option (This is called self-help repossession and is completely legal provided the secured creditor does not breach the peace in doing so). The debtor is in debt $10K to the secured creditor and $2000 to the unsecured creditors. Assume the <b>debtor</b> <b>defaults</b> and his only asset is the automobile. The dealership can repossess the auto and sell it to satisfy its debt. Two things can happen here: 1) The dealership sells the collateral (car) for more than the amount of the debt (let's say $15K). In this case, the debtor would receive the excess $5K (surplus) which he would use to satisfy the debts of his unsecured creditors (and then would have $3K left over). 2) The dealership repossess the car and sells it for less than the amount of the debt, let's say $9K (more likely scenario). In this case, the secured creditor dealership keeps the $9K, and the remaining $1K (deficiency) that the dealership is owed becomes unsecured - it is on the same level of priority as the other two unsecured loans. Those three unsecured claims of $1K each will be paid off equally. Thus, if the debtor has $1500 to satisfy its debts - each unsecured creditor would get $500 (1/3 of amount each). The remaining debt will probably never be repaid because, in cases such as these with the debtor having multiple loans on <b>default,</b> the <b>debtor</b> has most likely filed for Ch. 7 Bankruptcy.|$|R
