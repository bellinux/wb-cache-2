The promotion {{was the first in}} a series of planned national ENERGY STAR promotions aimed at increasing consumer familiarity with and loyalty to ENERGY STAR-qualifying products and related energy-saving best practices. Some of the evaluation findings were based on measurable indicators, such as traffic on the Internet, media impressions, ad equivalencies, products sold, number of participants, shelf space/model counts, mystery shopping, etc. In addition, much of the evaluation focused on talking to participants—including utilities, retailers, and manufacturers—to understand their experiences as promotion implementers. This included the experiences of utility partners who were participating in their first-ever ENERGY STAR lighting promotion, as well as the experiences of those with mature lighting programs. The evaluation examined how communications tools were used in the campaign—through the media, the Internet, and <b>in-store</b> <b>point-of-purchase</b> (POP) materials.

Advertising provides one of the clearest lines of visual differentiation between the Communist and non-Communist worlds. We take for granted the constant nattering of commercial messages through the broadcast media; fat and colorful publications in which information and entertainment are wedged as incidentals among compelling exhortations to consume; billboards, car cards, and <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>displays.</b> And for us, the absence or scarcity of advertising makes for an impression of gray drabness when we enter the urban landscape of Eastern Europe.

40|$|This study {{utilizes}} the relativity theory, from behavioral economics, {{to evaluate}} {{impact of a}} ‘decoy' product offering {{in a set of}} product choices on consumer evaluation and purchase intention of eco-friendly products. Product categories tested include multipurpose cleaners (low involvement decision), denim jeans (medium involvement), and vehicles (high involvement). 310 respondents were tested. The findings of this research indicate that the addition of a less-desirable "decoy" product offering has a positive effect on the overall evaluation and purchase intention of eco-friendly goods. Further, this research is unique in finding that the addition of a less-desirable "decoy" product offering also has a positive effect on certain evaluation components of equivalent-quality competitor products. This research provides a foundation to better market sustainably-produced goods at <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>displays</b> (both virtual and physical), indicating that marketers can influence and increase consumer purchase of eco-friendly goods.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to show the {{potential}} that strategic packaging communication could have on attracting a larger client base. Through revealing current packaging innovations and the psychology behind it, a business should be well informed on how to appeal to the maximum amount of customers. The study consisted of elite and specialized interviewing of industry experts in order to get an inside look at packaging and how companies are using it to communicate to their target markets. The next step was to survey this targeted customer base and discover the psychology behind their purchases and what is most desired in a product’s package. The results of this study revealed the decline in demand of <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>displays.</b> Price is becoming overwhelmingly important in which package is selected off the shelf. Store placement is still of great consequence and has shown to be the drive behind a significant amount of sales.

50|$|Louis Winter {{soon had}} {{to expand his}} {{operations}} and purchased a larger five story building from the Reichmann family, the former Planter's Peanut factory at 301 Lansdowne Avenue, just two blocks from Empire's current base on Florence Street, and he added additional production, including a synthesis laboratory {{on the top floor}} for the manufacturing of saccharine, the low calorie sweetener. Winter also purchased a printing facility which he renamed Professional Printing Services Limited from the Mount family in 1963 that was originally located at 1389 Weston Road, Toronto, and Walter and Peter Mount became Empire employees. Empire Laboratories could then provide all of its independent pharmacies from coast to coast with customized prescription delivery bags, <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>displays,</b> posters, and signage as a loyalty incentive, in an era prior to the dominance of national chain drug stores. Empire also provided medical practitioners with complimentary stationary and prescription pads.

40|$|Well-designed <b>Point-of-Purchase</b> <b>{{displays}}</b> {{can boost}} sales {{for a product}} tremendously. There is theory behind what POP displays should look like and therefore {{we thought it would}} be interesting to explore the Swedish retail environment and to see how POP displays are designed to increase sales. Therefore the purpose of this thesis is to provide a better understanding on how POPs are used in a retail environment. In order to reach this purpose, two research questions asked about how the POP design and the in-store environment can be described. Based on these questions we conducted a literature review that lead to a conceptual framework, which in turn presented what we would collect our data on. A qualitative, case study methodology was used, where the data was collected through observation of POPs at two Swedish supermarkets. The findings indicate that it is important for the products to be shown clearly and in a stylish matter and that the design should be unified, with the right proportions and having a clear focal point. It was also found that the power aisle has a great affect on the perception of the store, as well as an affect on the price perception and the image of the store. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the chief}} {{concerns}} of any business is to maintain steady, profitable growth in a rapidly evolving marketplace.

40|$|Many {{advertisers}} {{believe the}} pictorial and verbal components of an ad should convey the same meaning. Based on {{theoretical and empirical}} evidence from a va-riety of areas, three experiments were conducted that show superior recall for ads in which the picture and copy convey discrepant information about product attri-butes when the picture and brand name are linked interactively. An elaborative processing explanation for the effect {{is supported by the}} finding that this superiority diminishes if consumers have less opportunity to process the ad and form associative linkages in memory. Picture-Word Consistency and the Elaborative Processing of Advertisements Virtually all forms of marketing communications rely on a combination of verbal and nonverbal elements to convey the intended message. Within the store, manu-facturer <b>point-of-purchase</b> <b>displays,</b> packages, and re-tailer on-site merchandising materials often feature col-orful graphic and visual elements along with verbally oriented elements to attract consumer attention and con-vey a message about a product. Outside the store, news-paper and magazine advertisements as well as television commercials often emphasize their message through the same form of visually oriented communications, whereas radio uses music and sound effects. Despite this prom-inent use of nonverbal elements as message cues, sur-prisingly little research has examined the effects of non-verbal cues on consumer information processing. Even less research has investigated the effective integration of verbal and nonverbal elements in the design of market-ing communications. Recent studies on the effects of pictorial material in print advertisements generally has examined the impact of pictures added to verbal material in comparison with verbal material alone.

The concept of restaurant that joins the retail allowed visitors to do more activities. Malang city is a tourist city and one of the favorite culinary tourism destinations, so there are many restaurants and cafes. Beside taste and price, the main factor that visitors are looking for is the atmosphere. Store atmosphere {{can be used as a}} creative strategy to face the intense culinary business competition.

40|$|Can <b>point-of-purchase</b> (POP) <b>displays</b> cause a {{decrease}} in sales of the featured brand? In an actual test-market promotion, the use of special POP displays led to {{a decrease}} in sales of featured wines from a specific U. S. region. Moreover, sales of regularly shelved wines from competitive regions actually increased. The results of a laboratory experiment supported the explanation that the POP displays essentially reorganized the wines into region categories within the stores, {{making it easier for}} consumers to compare alternatives by region. As a result, sales of wines from preferred regions increased and sales of wines from disliked regions decreased relative to when the wines were displayed by variety categories on regular shelf space. Further evidence indicated that reorganizing products by levels of a given attribute influences purchase likelihoods mainly when the attribute is otherwise low rather than high in salience and when brands have normally high rather than low purchase likelihoods. 14 page(s...|$|R
40|$|A {{sustainable}} {{primary prevention}} strategy for infant {{iron deficiency anemia}} (IDA) was implemented and evaluated in a community with at-risk infants in northern Quebec, Canada. Communication strategies were used to promote iron-rich complementary food rather than iron-fortified formula, which can interfere with breastfeeding practice. This food-based approach has been successfully implemented in developing countries, but has not been applied in an industrialized country setting. Mass media (i. e., radio dialogues, key messages, print material, <b>point-of-purchase</b> grocery store <b>display)</b> and interpersonal (i. e., homemade baby food cooking activity) communication strategies were developed in collaboration with community members and implemented in partnership with an existing community program. Reach and exposure of the strategies were measured using a questionnaire administered to a post-intervention sample (n = 45). Sales of promoted iron-rich infant food were examined pre- and post-intervention period. A repeat cross-sectional design {{was used for the}} impact evaluation. Two groups of mothers with infants, aged 7 - 10 months at Time 1 (n = 32) and Time 2 (n = 22) were interviewed. Outcome variables were infants' total iron and complementary food iron intakes measured by two 24 -hour recalls. Secular trends in infants' hemoglobin values and milk type consumption were examined in the study community and two comparison communities. Multiple communication channels increased awareness of IDA and influenced self-reported use of iron-rich infant food. Iron-rich infant food sales increased from pre- to post-intervention (p < 0. 05). Complementary food intake iron increased between Time 1 (3. 2 +/- 0. 8 mg) and Time 2 (4. 4 +/- 1. 1 mg) (p < 0. 05). The proportion of infants with anemia (hemoglobin < 110 g/L) significantly decreased from the period before (37. 2 %) to during (14. 3 %) the intervention (p < 0. 05). No significant difference was found for this variable within the comparison communities. The proportion of infants receiving iron-fortified formula in the study community did not differ between Time 1 and Time 2, but increased from Time 1 (55 %) to Time 2 (73 %) (p < 0. 05) in the comparison communities, indicating an erosion of breastfeeding practice. These results suggest the effectiveness of communication strategies to improve infant iron nutrition in a community with good access to iron-rich infant food. The potential for this strategy in other communities warrants further investigation...|$|R
