The system can be tuned at up to 1 KHz over the 3. 3 - 3. 8 micron spectral region, where hydrogen-bond stretching modes provide spectroscopic signatures {{for a wide variety}} of chemicals. We have fielded the DIAL system on the LLNL site with targets at <b>horizontal</b> <b>ranges</b> of up to 2 km.

60|$|The coast {{as far as}} Bahia Blanca (in {{latitude}} 39 degrees S.) {{is formed}} either of a <b>horizontal</b> <b>range</b> of cliffs, or of immense accumulations of sand-dunes. Within Bahia Blanca, {{a small piece of}} tableland, about twenty feet above high-water mark, called Punta Alta, is formed of strata of cemented gravel and of red earthy mud, abounding with shells (with others lying loose on the surface), and the bones of extinct mammifers. These shells, twenty in number, together with a Balanus and two corals, are all recent species, still inhabiting the neighbouring seas. They will be enumerated in the Fourth Chapter, when describing the Pampean formation; five of them are identical with the upraised ones from near Buenos Ayres. The northern shore of Bahia Blanca is, in main part, formed of immense sand-dunes, resting on gravel with recent shells, and ranging in lines parallel to the shore. These ranges are separated from each other by flat spaces, composed of stiff impure red clay, in which, at the distance of about two miles from the coast, I found by digging a few minute fragments of sea-shells. The sand-dunes extend several miles inland, and stand on a plain, which slopes up to a height of between one hundred and two hundred feet. Numerous, small, well-rounded pebbles of pumice lie scattered both on the plain and sand-hillocks: at Monte Hermoso, on the flat summit of a cliff, I found many of them at a height of 120 feet (angular measurement) above the level of the sea. These pumice pebbles, no doubt, were originally brought down from the Cordillera by the rivers which cross the continent, {{in the same way as}} the river Negro anciently brought down, and still brings down, pumice, and as the river Chupat brings down scoriae: when once delivered at the mouth of a river, they would naturally have travelled along the coasts, and been cast up during the elevation of the land, at different heights. The origin of the argillaceous flats, which separate the parallel ranges of sand-dunes, seems due to the tides here having a tendency (as I believe they have on most shoal, protected coasts) to throw up a bar parallel to the shore, and at some distance from it; this bar gradually becomes larger, affording a base for the accumulation of sand- dunes, and the shallow space within then becomes silted up with mud. The repetition of this process, without any elevation of the land, would form a level plain traversed by parallel lines of sand-hillocks; during a slow elevation of the land, the hillocks would rest on a gently inclined surface, like that on the northern shore of Bahia Blanca. I did not observe any shells in this neighbourhood at a greater height than twenty feet; and therefore the age of the sea-drifted pebbles of pumice, now standing at the height of 120 feet, must remain uncertain.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that the {{atmospheric}} inhomogeneities have great impact on sound propagation over long ranges. For the application of predicting wind turbine noise, either the flow wakes generated by rotating turbine blades or small-scale atmospheric turbulence can affect the propagation of sound over ground surfaces from individual turbines. ^ In this thesis, the effects of wake and atmospheric turbulence on the propagation of wind turbine noise are investigated. By introducing the Parabolic Equation (PE) method, the effects of atmospheric changes in sound speed can be incorporated at each marching step as the prediction of sound field advances in the <b>horizontal</b> <b>ranges.</b> With a simulated wake profile near the wind turbine, more accurate predictions in the sound field can be achieved for realistic atmospheric conditions. This work aims to improve current prediction schemes for assessing the impact of wind turbine noise on the neighborhood communities. ...|$|R
