The use of distributed blowing {{through the surface}} of a cylinder to reduce this source of noise was investigated experimentally. Two configurations were tested, one with a cylinder upstream of an <b>H-beam</b> (denoted the OH configuration) and the other with an <b>H-beam</b> upstream of the cylinder (denoted the HO configuration). The mean velocities and velocity fluctuations were determined in the flowfield using particle image velocimetry. The application of blowing to the OH configuration reduced the streamwise Reynolds stress (u′u′). This resulted in a noise reduction of 9. 2 dB at a Strouhal number (St) of 0. 2.
