Four workers were killed while 67 others - including three firefighters - were hospitalized for burns and exposure to ammonia gases. The explosion happened when natural gas was purged into the interior of the building during commissioning of a new, gas-fired water heater. This explosion was directly responsible for an amendment to the National Fuel Gas Code prohibiting <b>fuel</b> gas <b>piping</b> systems in large buildings from being purged indoors.|$|R

40|$|Pipe route design plays a {{prominent}} role in ship design. Due to the complex configuration in layout space with numerous pipelines, diverse design constraints, and obstacles, it is a complicated and time-consuming process to obtain the optimal route of ship pipes. In this article, an optimized design method for branch pipe routing is proposed to improve design efficiency and to reduce human errors. By simplifying equipment and ship hull models and dividing workspace into three-dimensional grid cells, the mathematic model of layout space is constructed. Based on the proposed concept of pipe grading method, the optimization model of pipe routing is established. Then an optimization procedure is presented to deal with pipe route planning problem by combining maze algorithm (MA), nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (NSGA-II), and cooperative coevolutionary nondominated sorting genetic algorithm II (CCNSGA-II). To improve the performance in genetic algorithm procedure, a fixed-length encoding method is presented based on improved maze algorithm and adaptive region strategy. Fuzzy set theory is employed to extract the best compromise pipeline from Pareto optimal solutions. Simulation test of branch pipe and design optimization of a <b>fuel</b> <b>piping</b> system were carried out to illustrate the design optimization procedure in detail and to verify the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed methodology...|$|E
40|$|Column {{separation}} on {{both the}} upstream and downstream sides of a valve in an aviation kerosene pipeline {{was the subject of}} an investigation involving the method of characteristics to solve the partial differential equations governing pressure transient propagation. Particular attention was given to obtaining accurate velocity results at the instant the predicted pressure at a section reached vapour pressure. A test rig utilizing L. 56 aluminium alloy <b>fuel</b> <b>piping</b> and other aircraft standard components and pumping Aviation Kerosene Specification 2494, was employed to investigate the phenomenon and test the computing procedures. For separation upstream of a valve following closure, a comparison of the computed and observed results indicated an accuracy within 3 % for the first peak following valve closure and 5 % for the cavity duration. Computed results within 10 % of the observed were obtained for the later peaks following cavity collapse. Observation and filming of the sequence of events downstream of the valve during and following closure indicated that the air released during initial separation remained out of solution. The effect of this air was significant but could be included, in terms of its partial pressure, in the cavity boundary equations. The predicted cavity collapse pressures were consistently above those observed. Predicted values of maximum and minimum pressures, and their event times, following valve closure were, at worst, within 10 % of the observed results. Analysis of the released gas indicated that it had normal air composition. Measurement of column velocity from the films and the use of a hot film probe and anemometer supported the assumptions made with reference to column motion. The hot film probe results demonstrated that this flow measurement technique was practical in this application...|$|E

5000|$|Boiling water {{reactors}} {{generally have}} negative void coefficients, and in normal operation the negative void coefficient allows reactor {{power to be}} adjusted by changing the rate of water flow through the core. However, the negative void coefficient can cause an unplanned reactor power increase in events (such as sudden closure of a steamline valve) where the reactor pressure is suddenly increased. In addition, the negative void coefficient can result in power oscillations {{in the event of}} a sudden reduction in core flow, such as might be caused by a recirculation pump failure. Boiling water reactors are designed to ensure that the rate of pressure rise from a sudden steamline valve closure is limited to acceptable values, and they include multiple safety systems designed to ensure that any sudden reactor power increases or unstable power oscillations are terminated before <b>fuel</b> or <b>piping</b> damage can occur.|$|R

40|$|AbstractA set {{of dynamic}} models was {{developed}} for an indirect district heating system (IDHS), including pumps and adjusting valves. Firstly, dynamic simulations were conducted {{to find out how}} the supply water temperature of the boiler, indoor air temperature and fuel consumption vary with outdoor temperature. The influence of outdoor temperature could be compensated by modulating fuel consumptions, but the influences of solar radiation and indoor heat gains could not be ignored. Then, one-week operational states were simulated with actual meteorological data exerted and validated. And then, different control strategies were implemented and the one-week operational situations were simulated, respectively. The smallest indoor temperature variations could be achieved if the <b>fuel,</b> the primary <b>piping</b> network and radiator water flow rates were jointly controlled. However, the least amount of energy was consumed if the fuel consumption was controlled in terms of boiler supply temperature jointly with primary piping network flow rate controlled in terms of indoor temperature...|$|R

40|$|The {{sustainable}} {{transportation of}} liquid <b>fuels</b> in a <b>piping</b> {{system can be}} interrupted due to slug flow, which causes the severe unsteady loading on pipelines. A feature that is particularly affected by this problem is the oil transportation pipeline, where gas is often combined with the produced oil. In order to fully understand the behavior of such flows, {{it is imperative to}} simulate the effective zones along the span of the pipelines. This will allow the designer of the piping system to estimate the required pumping power through the evaluation of the pressure drop in the slug oil/gas flow. This paper reports the oil/gas flow phenomena in a horizontal pipe with a large diameter of 0. 16 m, with 3 -dimensional, transient, incompressible fluids, utilizing STAR-CCM+ commercial software. The volume of fluid (VOF) model was adopted to track the interface between the two phases. The operational conditions for the cases studied were extracted for the slug zone from the Baker chart. The slug flow was achieved accordingly, which gives us granted validation with the experimental source. The numerical procedure allowed the determination of the pressure drop. Also, the transient behavior of the slug flow was predicted through the tracking of the slug development in the pipe segment. Moreover, the proposed model could be extended to simulate other types of two-phase flow regimes...|$|R
40|$|Nondestructive testing (NDT) is a {{collection}} of analysis techniques used by scientists and technologists as a way of analyzing the interior of an object without damaging the object. Since the analysis is done without damaging the object, NDT is an extremely valuable technique used in various industries for troubleshooting and research. CNDE {{has a long history of}} working with a variety of industrial sectors which include Aerospace (commercial and military aviation) and Defense Systems (ground vehicles and personnel protection); Energy (nuclear, wind, fossil); Infrastructure and Transportation (bridges, roadways, dams, levees); and Petro-Chemical (offshore, processing, <b>fuel</b> transport <b>piping)</b> to provide cost-effective tools and solutions. X-ray tomography is the procedure of using X-rays for generating tomographic slices of the required object. The object is bombarded with X-rays and the scanned image intensity values are collected on a detector. A significant drawback in X-ray tomography is the amount of data collected. It is generally huge in the order of gigabytes and hence the processing of data presents a big challenge. One way to speed up the processing of data is to run the programs on a cluster. CNDE uses a 64 node Beowulf cluster to do the reconstruction of an image. However with the advent of the GPU (Graphic Processing Unit) we have a far more cost efficient and time efficient hardware to run the reconstruction algorithm. The GPU can be fitted into a single PC, costs 10 times less than the cluster and also has a longer life time. This thesis has two major components to it. One of it is the desvelopment of new preprocessing and post processing techniques (includes filters, hot pixel removal etc.) to improve the quality of the input data and the other is the implementation of these techniques as well as the reconstruction program on the GPU using CUDA. Speedup on the GPU is not just a matter of porting the developed algorithms in parallel onto the hardware like in a cluster. GPU architecture is extremely complex and involves the usage of many different types of memory each with its own advantages and disadvantages and also many other optimization techniques for accessing and processing the data. These new techniques as well as the introduction of GPU are a significant addition to X-ray program here at CNDE...|$|R
40|$|This {{study has}} {{extended}} {{the development of}} an exciting technology which promises to enable the Pb-Bi eutectic cooled reactors to operate at temperatures up to 650 - 700 °C. This new technology is a functionally graded composite steel which resists high temperature LBE corrosion. This composite steel consists of a Fel 2 Cr 2 Si protective layer weld overlaid on a T 91 steel and then drawn to <b>fuel</b> cladding and <b>piping</b> material. A series of tests and materials analysis were performed on the composite piping material. These tests / analysis included microstructural characterization, heat treatment optimization, creep and tensile testing, diffusion testing, and long term static corrosion tests. Although the composite fuel cladding was not available {{at the time of this}} study, all of the results from the piping material characterization are directly applicable to the fuel cladding material. It has been shown that the heat treated composite piping material exhibits mechanical properties in excess of the ASTM minimum standard for T 91. This material also exhibits a conservative corrosion rate of< 22 pm/yr in static Pb-Bi eutectic. This low corrosion rate will enable fuel cladding to have a 3. 6 year lifetime and piping material a 36 year lifetime, if the static corrosion rate is equivalent to the flowing corrosion rate. This material has also been shown to have a very slow diffusion rate for chromium, with a chromium inter-diffusion zone of < 35 um over the lifetime of the nuclear reactor. There still however exist several challenges to implementing this technology. The challenges include resolving the issue of cracking of the Fel 2 Cr 2 Si layer during tube drawing and increasing the high temperature stress / creep resistance of the structural T 91 layer. by Elliott Shepard Fray.
