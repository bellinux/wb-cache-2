(Though it is described in the Gospel of Peter) [...] If the <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> remained in the same location where Jesus' head had lain, it suggests that the resurrection process saw Jesus lifted through his clothing or that he dematerialized while in them. If the <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> had been balled up and put to the side, it suggests that Jesus returned to life while lying in the clothes and himself removed the wrapping from his head leaving it beside him.|$|E

50|$|In {{more recent}} times, the {{possibility}} that Jesus passed through cloth and dematerialized has frequently been regarded as evidence of divine action by God. This interpretation, however, was not one {{that existed in the}} early church, which viewed such interpretations as docetism. Those advocating a more supernatural account have argued that the fact that the soudarion (a <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> for the dead) and the other grave clothes were set apart merely reflects the distance of the neck as it is situated between the head and the body, or that it simply means that the cloth was curled in a ball rather than lying flat, i.e., that it was lying in a different manner to the others.|$|E
5000|$|The exact {{relationship}} between this headpiece {{and the other}} clothes is not certain. The passage can be read either as meaning the cloth {{is not in the}} same location of the others or as meaning the cloth is not lying in the same manner of the others. Is the cloth separated from the others, and if so where is it? One interpretation is that this separation merely reflects the distance from the head to the torso. Others see the cloth as being moved to a part of the burial place or tomb well away from the other cloths. Those who believe the phrase is closer to [...] "not lying like" [...] believe that it simply refers to the <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> being in a ball rather than lying flat like the others.|$|E

5000|$|Some Christians {{believe that}} long hair is {{intended}} to be the only headcovering that Paul describes (see 1 Corinthians 11:14-15).

50|$|A kippah is a <b>cloth</b> <b>head</b> {{covering}} worn by Jewish males during prayer {{or other}} ritual services. Some wear it every day. In the United States, most synagogues and Jewish funeral services keep a ready supply of kipot for the temporary use of visitors {{who have not}} brought one.|$|R
5000|$|The {{difference}} in {{male and female}} apparel lies in accessories. Men wear a hand woven pis (<b>head</b> <b>cloth)</b> and a 15m-long kandit (belt or sash) made of red cloth called gilim. The pis serves as [...] "protection" [...] from spears and knives during combat, and may be fastened around the trousers. The women wear a short skirt over the trousers, around which a rectangular, hand woven cloth is tied. This cloth {{is the most expensive}} part of their costume because it is woven in a tedious manner. Men and women wear the saruk, the Yakan hat worn to make one look more attractive and elegant. Some wear the hat over the turban {{and use it as a}} purse for betel nuts, tobacco, and money. Yakan warriors wear a bulletproof shirt prepared by hadjis and imams who write Arabic script all over the shirt (Sherfan 1976:160, 205-207).|$|E
5000|$|In contrast, the Visayans wore clothes {{similar to}} that of Indonesians and Malaysians. They wore a robe called Marlota or jacket called Baquero without a collar that reached the feet. The robes or jackets were brightly coloured. The Tagalogs and the Visayans bound their foreheads and temples with long, narrow strips of cloth called Putong. Necks were covered with gold necklaces, and wrists with golden armlets called Calombigas - these had {{intricate}} patterns. Others would wear precious stones.The usual male headdress was the pudong, a turban; though in Panay, both men and women also wore a <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> or bandana called saplung. Commoners wore pudong of rough abaca cloth wrapped around only a few turns so that {{it was more of a}} headband than a turban and was therefore called pudong-pudong - as the crowns and diadems on Christian images were later called. A red pudong was called magalong, and was the insignia of braves who had killed an enemy.|$|E
5000|$|John {{additionally}} {{describes the}} presence of a soudarion, for the head, that was set apart. A soudarion is literally a sweat rag; more specifically it was a piece of cloth used to wipe away sweat, but in the context of dead bodies, most scholars believe it was used to keep the jaw closed. Tradition holds that the Sudarion was a turban, and that it later found its way to Oviedo in Spain, becoming the Sudarium of Oviedo. Although it may initially seem insignificant, the fact that the item for the head was set apart fundamentally affects Christology. If the <b>head</b> <b>cloth</b> remained in the same location as the remainder of the clothes, and if these remained where the body had been, it implies that Jesus' body was lifted through the clothing, or that Jesus' body de-materialised and re-materialised elsewhere, hence supporting more docetic interpretations. Conversely, it being set apart implies the opposite—that someone took the clothes off in an ordinary manner. Furthermore, the Greek text uses the word entetuligmenon, translated [...] "having been folded up", seeming to imply some intentional action had been taken on the soudarion. Some see this as a direct attack by the author of John on docetism, and the gnosticism that used the synoptic accounts to advocate it.|$|E
