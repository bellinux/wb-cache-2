5|$|JIVE Records {{commissioned}} a music video {{for the song}} to be directed by Billie Woodruff. It was produced under Geneva Films, while the choreography was created by Wade Robson. The narrative of the video shows Spears dreaming as she sleeps in her room. As the dream begins, Spears is shown in a blue and silver futuristic room with several different levels, where she sings and walks around, and puts {{her feet on the}} wall while wearing a shiny silver outfit. MTV news reporter Ellen Thompson considered it the sexiest moment of the music video. As the video continues, Spears is seen on top of the apartment building she lives in, performing a dance segment in a red top and black skirt with a few backup dancers. The following scenes shows the singer wearing white clothes and singing in the room in which she is sleeping, while her love interest comes <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> to see her. Together, they start a pillow fight that shortly ends after Spears is shown again in her room still sleeping, however, now with a smile upon her face. A longer dance segment intercalates with all the scenes during the whole video.|$|E

Lou Blonger soon arrived to arrange her defense, and {{eventually}} she was acquitted. Kitty had previously worked in Albuquerque, where she had a soiled reputation.

25|$|In the 1997–1998 anime series Street Fighter II V, Chun-Li is {{introduced}} as the fifteen-year-old daughter of Inspector Dorai, a Hong Kong police chief {{who has also}} schooled her in the martial arts. While attempting to bring down a drug smuggling operation in the country, he works with Interpol to investigate a mysterious organization known as Shadowlaw. Chun-Li serves as the tour guide for Ryu and Ken when they {{pay a visit to}} work on their training; Ken is smitten with her and later buys her lavish gifts, including an engagement ring. Despite being underage, they enter a club in a dangerous part of town that hosts an underground fighting ring so Ryu and Ken can prove themselves as street fighters. After Ryu soundly defeats several opponents, the trio are marked for death by the ringleader as a result, and while on the run they encounter and battle various street gangs before being rescued by Chun-Li's father. Traveling with Ryu and Ken to Spain, Chun-Li is stalked by an obsessive Vega, who presents her with a severed bull's ear, intercepts her outside her hotel, sneaks <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> to observe her in her sleep, then invites her to a masquerade ball that is actually a setup to get Ken to fight him in a cage match. The whole time, Chun-Li is under the influence of Vega's love potion, but it wears off when Vega is defeated. Bison then accosts Chun-Li and she realizes that he is the leader of Shadowlaw, who, unbeknownst to her, had also hired Cammy to garrote Chun-Li's father, an attack he barely survives. Chun-Li plays her largest role in the five-part finale, when she and Ryu are kidnapped and brainwashed by Bison via microchips embedded in their foreheads, and like in the 1994 film, she acquires her signature outfit (albeit grayish-blue with white accents and slightly modified) while Bison's captive. The chip puts her into an overly aggressive state, which she displays by snapping an opponent's neck in combat, and she later manages to overpower Guile in battle before Ryu and Ken, during their victorious final fight against Bison, succeed in destroying the equipment triggering the chips (in addition to reducing the Shadowlaw base to ruins), returning Chun-Li to normal.|$|E
500|$|At {{the age of}} fourteen, Shanina, {{against her}} parents' wishes, walked [...] across the taiga to the rail station and {{travelled}} to Arkhangelsk to study at the college there (the trek was later attested by Shanina's school teacher Alexander Makaryin). Shanina left home with little money and almost no possessions; and {{before moving to the}} college dormitory she lived with her elder brother Fyodor. Later in her combat diary Shanina would recall Arkhangelsk's stadium Dinamo, and the cinemas, Ars and Pobeda. Shanina's friend Anna Samsonova remembered that Roza sometimes returned from her friends in Ustyansky District to her college dormitory between 2:00 and 3:00 am. As the doors were locked by that time, the other students tied several bedsheets together to help Roza climb <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room.</b> In 1938, Shanina {{became a member of the}} Soviet youth movement Komsomol.|$|E
500|$|Murasaki {{disliked the}} men at court whom she thought to be drunken and stupid. However, some scholars, such as Waley, are certain she was {{involved}} romantically with Michinaga. At the least, Michinaga pursued her and pressured her strongly, and her flirtation with him is recorded in her diary as late as 1010. Yet, she wrote {{to him in a}} poem, [...] "You have neither read my book, nor won my love." [...] In her diary she records having to avoid advances from Michinaga—one night he sneaked <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> stealing a newly written chapter of Genji. However, Michinaga's patronage was essential if she was to continue writing. Murasaki described his daughter's court activities: the lavish ceremonies, the complicated courtships, the [...] "complexities of the marriage system", and in elaborate detail, the birth of Shōshi's two sons.|$|E

Nyle, monitoring Elena's actions, is intrigued by this blatant display of psychic ability and pleased at Margo's death. He allows Elena to leave her cell, then activates the prism, causing her to convulse and pass out. While unconscious, Elena is approached by a massive entity in a red space suit (identified as a [...] "Sentionaut"), who injects her with a syringe before walking off.|$|E
2500|$|Due to Anna Lizas success, Vega {{was dubbed}} the [...] "Original Soap Opera Princess". Director Ruel Bayani, the {{producer}} of ABS-CBN's remake of Anna Liza, commended Vega, calling her portrayal of the role [...] "iconic" [...] and that she set a high standard on being a [...] "child star". Judy Ann Santos once stated on StarStudio's special issue about Santos herself {{that she is a}} fan of Vega, and when she learned about the latter's death, she first disappeared <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> and then into the bathroom. She turned the bathroom's doorknob quietly, pushed the door shut then {{stood in front of the}} sink. She then looked at herself in the mirror and cried.|$|E
2500|$|Fellow Miller's Court {{resident}} and prostitute, Mary Ann Cox, who described herself as [...] "a widow and unfortunate", reported seeing Kelly returning home drunk {{in the company}} of a stout ginger-haired man wearing a bowler hat and carrying a can of beer at about 11:45p.m. Cox and Kelly wished each other goodnight. Kelly went <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> with the man and then started singing the song [...] "A Violet I Plucked from Mother's Grave When a Boy." [...] She was still singing when Cox went out at midnight, and when she returned an hour later at 1:00. Elizabeth Prater had the room above Kelly's and when she went to bed at 1:30, the singing had stopped.|$|E

2500|$|In July 1817 {{his mother}} died after the sudden onset of violent stomach pains and amidst the grief his older sisters had to take charge, with their father {{continuing}} to dominate the household whenever he returned from his doctor's rounds. To the -year-old Charles this situation was not a great change, as his mother had frequently been ill and her available time taken up by social duties, so his upbringing had largely been {{in the hands of}} his three older sisters who were nearly adults by then. In later years he had difficulty in remembering his mother, and his only memory of her death and funeral was of the children being sent for and going <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room,</b> and his [...] "Father meeting us crying afterwards".|$|E
2500|$|In Ophelia's next appearance, {{she tells}} Polonius that Hamlet rushed <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> with his {{clothing}} askew and a [...] "hellish" [...] {{expression on his}} face; he only stared at her, nodding three times without speaking to her. Based on what Ophelia told him, Polonius concludes that he was wrong to forbid Ophelia from seeing Hamlet, and that Hamlet must be mad with love for her. Polonius immediately decides to go to Claudius, the new King of Denmark and also Hamlet's uncle and stepfather, about the situation. Polonius later suggests to Claudius that they hide behind an [...] to overhear Hamlet speaking to Ophelia, when Hamlet thinks the conversation is private. Since Polonius is now sure that Hamlet is lovesick for Ophelia, he thinks Hamlet will express his love for her. Claudius agrees to try the eavesdropping plan later.|$|E
2500|$|Murasaki's [...] The Tale of Genji {{is barely}} {{mentioned}} in the diary. She writes the Emperor had the story read to him, and that colored papers and calligraphers had been selected for transcriptions of the manuscript – done by court women. In one anecdote she tells of Michinaga sneaking <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> to help himself to {{a copy of the}} manuscript. [...] There are parallels between the later chapters of Genji and the diary. According to Genji scholar Shirane, the scene in the diary which describes Ichijo's imperial procession to Michinaga's mansion in 1008 corresponds closely to an imperial procession in [...] "Chapter 33 (Wisteria Leaves)" [...] of The Tale of Genji. Shirane believes the similarities suggest portions of Genji may have been written during the period Murasaki was in imperial service and wrote the diary.|$|E

2500|$|Upon {{arrival in}} Grasse, Grenouille catches {{the scent of}} Laura Richis (Rachel Hurd-Wood), the beautiful, redheaded {{daughter}} of the wealthy Antoine Richis (Alan Rickman) and decides {{that she will be}} his [...] "thirteenth scent", the linchpin of his perfume. Grenouille finds a job in Grasse under Madame Arnulfi (Corinna Harfouch) and learns the method of enfleurage. He kills a young lavender picker and attempts to extract her scent using the method of hot enfleurage, which fails. After this, he attempts the method of cold enfleurage on a prostitute he hired, but she becomes alarmed and tries to throw him out. He murders her and successfully preserves the scent of the woman. Grenouille embarks on a killing spree, targeting beautiful young women and capturing their scents using his perfected method. He dumps the women's naked corpses around the city, creating panic. After preserving the first twelve scents, Grenouille plans his attack on Laura. During a church sermon excommunicating him, it is announced that a man has confessed to the murders. Richis remains unconvinced and secretly flees the city with his daughter, telling no-one their destination. Grenouille tracks her scent to a roadside inn and sneaks <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> that night, murdering her.|$|E
2500|$|Upon their marriage, Thomas {{moved into}} his wife’s house, at Chelsea Manor in London, {{where she lived}} with her step-daughter, the 14-year-old Elizabeth. Thomas was the uncle of Elizabeth's half-brother, and the newly wed husband of her step-mother, and their family roles {{regarding}} each other were, perhaps, unclear. Now, living {{under the same roof}} as Elizabeth, Thomas became more than a little familiar, if not intimate, with Elizabeth, indulging in daily romps with her, tickling her, and slapping her on her behind as she lay in her bed, or coming <b>into</b> <b>her</b> <b>room</b> in his nightclothes. Her governess, Kat Ashley, thought this scandalous, and reported it to Catherine. [...] Indignant, Thomas retorted, 'By God's precious soul, I mean no evil, and I will not leave it!' [...] At first, Catherine dismissed the behaviour as just innocent fun, and even joined in the romps on a few occasions. Elizabeth's feelings regarding this behaviour are unknown, but it was said that she bore Thomas some degree of affection. And though her governess, Kat Ashley, [...] "bade him go away in shame," [...] she found him more amusing than dangerous. When Catherine was pregnant in the spring of 1548, she had become concerned enough about her husband’s flirtatious relationship with Elizabeth that she sent Elizabeth away to live with Anthony Denny and his wife, Joan Champernowne (Kat Ashley's sister), in Hertfordshire. In June 1548, Catherine and Thomas Seymour moved their household from London to Sudeley Castle, the property granted to Seymour when he became Baron Seymour of Sudeley. In September 1548, Catherine gave birth to a daughter, Mary Seymour. In the following days, she became uncharacteristically hostile and delusional. Thomas lay in bed with her to quiet her, but she did not get better, and died of complications due to childbirth, just before Elizabeth’s 15th birthday. Upon her death, Catherine bequeathed all of her possessions to Thomas, making him one of the richest men in England. He said he was [...] "amazed" [...] at her death; yet it opened up new opportunities to him, as his eye returned to Elizabeth. From fear or shrewdness, she avoided him, returning, with her governess, Kat Ashley, to her childhood home, Hatfield House.|$|E
