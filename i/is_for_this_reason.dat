5|$|Developed {{over many}} centuries, Kraków {{provides}} a showcase setting for many historic styles of architecture. As the city expanded, so too did the architectural achievements of its builders. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{the variations in}} style and urban planning are so easily recognisable.|$|E
5|$|A common idea in {{the comics}} is that Bruce saw a Zorro film with his parents before they were murdered. Nolan {{explained}} that by ignoring that idea – which he stated is not found in Batman's first appearances – it {{emphasized the importance of}} bats to Bruce and that becoming a superhero is a wholly original idea on his part. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> Nolan believes other DC characters do not exist in the universe of his film; otherwise, Wayne's reasons for taking up costumed vigilantism would have been very different.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} for forensic anthropologists {{to take into account}} all available markers in the determination of sex due to the differences that can occur between individuals of the same sex. For example, it is possible that a female may have a slightly more narrow than normal pubic arch. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that anthropologists usually classify sex as one of five possibilities: male, may be male, indeterminate, may be female, or female. In addition, forensic anthropologists are generally unable to make a sex determination unless the individual was an adult at the time of death. The sexual dimorphisms present in the skeleton begin to occur during puberty and are not fully pronounced until after sexual maturation.|$|E
25|$|The {{police and}} the {{government}} were {{of the opinion that}} the death penalty deterred offenders from carrying firearms and it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that such offences remained punishable by death.|$|R
50|$|To start with, it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that smaller {{terraces}} were merged {{in around}} 1950, {{this resulted in}} large scale reallocation, which turned parts of the original landscape completely upside down.|$|R
50|$|There {{are several}} {{measures}} of hypoxemia {{that can be}} assessed, but there are various limitations associated with each. It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the MIGET was developed, to overcome the shortcomings of previous methods.|$|R
5|$|The {{small size}} of the airport is perhaps best {{illustrated}} {{with the fact that}} a Boeing 757 cannot taxi past another aircraft to parking positions. As a result, controllers are responsible not only for ensuring that valuable space is utilised, but also ensuring that other aircraft are kept circling until larger aircraft are parked. Despite these limitations, the airport successfully handles ten to twenty times more traffic than airports of a comparable size. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that plans to relocate the airport are so important in the short-term scale. In 2006, a NIS 5.5 million renovation programme of Eilat Airport's terminal and runway was undertaken, designed to sustain the airport until it is replaced in the near future.|$|E
25|$|Viral {{integration}} {{tends to}} occur in or near oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes and it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{the integration of the}} virus can greatly {{contribute to the development of}} tumor characteristics.|$|E
25|$|By 1840, {{the area}} of Nova Scotia Gardens had {{degenerated}} into a notorious slum. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the philanthropist, Angela Burdett-Coutts purchased the land, and, after the leases expired, established Columbia Market in 1869.|$|E
50|$|In 1848, {{along with}} Giacomo Margotti, {{he founded the}} newspaper, Armonia ("Harmony") in Turin. It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that he fell a victim to the anti-clerical {{influence}} which had deprived him of his post at Superga.|$|R
50|$|The {{area where}} Milano Santa Giulia {{is being built}} is a 296 acre wide former {{industrial}} zone, where Montedison and Acciaierie Redaelli facilities used to <b>be.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason,</b> the district <b>is</b> also nicknamed Montecity, after Montedison.|$|R
5000|$|Giscard has, {{throughout}} his political career, {{always been a}} proponent of greater European union. In 1978, he <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> the obvious target of Jacques Chirac's Call of Cochin, denouncing the [...] "party of the foreigners".|$|R
25|$|The term Implementer was the self-given name of {{the creators}} of the text {{adventure}} series Zork. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that game designers and programmers {{can be referred to}} as an Implementer (video games), often shortened to Imp, rather than a writer.|$|E
25|$|Noseclips {{can prevent}} water from {{getting in the}} nose. However, this is {{generally}} only used for synchronised swimming. Using noseclips in competitive swimming can cause a disadvantage to most swimmers. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that noseclips are only used for synchronised swimming and recreational swimming.|$|E
25|$|Despite their effectiveness, non-water agents do not {{cleanse the}} hands of organic material, but simply {{disinfect}} them. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that hand sanitizers are not as effective as soap and water at preventing the spread of many pathogens, since the pathogens still remain on the hands.|$|E
5000|$|Francisco Pizarro [...] "founded Lima on the Day of the Kings...it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that Lima took as {{its arms}} and device the three crowns {{of the holy}} Kings and the shining star that {{appeared}} to them." ...|$|R
50|$|The area slowly {{started to}} change after {{expensive}} houses were built in Elizabeth Bay and further east and a road was needed from Sydney. It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that William Street was built, dividing the land for the first time.|$|R
60|$|Tarzan {{nodded his}} head. He {{was a man}} of few words, and {{possibly}} it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> as much as any that Kadour ben Saden had taken to him, <b>for</b> if there <b>be</b> one thing that an Arab despises it is a talkative man.|$|R
25|$|A Catechumen (from Latin catechumenus, Greek κατηχουμενος , instructed) is one {{receiving}} {{instruction in}} {{the principles of the}} Christian religion with a view to baptism. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that those who are already validly baptized in another Christian Faith are not known as Catechumens, but rather Candidates.|$|E
25|$|Because of the {{independence}} of local communities, Jewish ethnicities, even when they circumscribe differences in liturgy, language, cuisine and other cultural accoutrements, are more often a reflection of geographic and historical isolation from other communities. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that communities are referred to by referencing the historical region in which the community cohered when discussing their practices, regardless of where those practices are found today.|$|E
25|$|The Catholic Church and {{the ancient}} Christian Churches see priestly {{ordination}} as a sacrament dedicating the person ordained to a permanent relationship of service, and, like Baptism and Confirmation, having an ontological effect on the person. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that a person may be ordained {{to each of the}} three orders only once. They also consider that ordination can be conferred only on males.|$|E
50|$|NSAIDs can be {{classified}} based on their chemical structure or mechanism of action. Older NSAIDs were known long before their mechanism of action was elucidated and <b>were</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> classified by chemical structure or origin. Newer substances are more often classified by mechanism of action.|$|R
6000|$|... [67] It was {{supposed}} that Napoleon contemplated constituting Central Italy, {{or at least}} Tuscany, into a kingdom for his brother Jerome, and that it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the latter {{had been sent to}} Florence with a French corps {{at the beginning of the}} war.|$|R
60|$|Norris {{supported}} <b>this</b> view. It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that when, {{at breakfast}} {{on the day}} on which Jephson's were due to play Leicester's, he received an invitation {{from one of his}} many uncles to spend a weekend at his house, he decided to accept it.|$|R
25|$|Intravenous sodium {{bicarbonate}} is an aqueous solution that is sometimes used for cases of acidosis, or when insufficient sodium or bicarbonate ions {{are in the}} blood. In cases of respiratory acidosis, the infused bicarbonate ion drives the carbonic acid/bicarbonate buffer of plasma to the left and, thus, raises the pH. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that {{sodium bicarbonate}} is used in medically supervised cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Infusion of bicarbonate is indicated only when the blood pH is markedly (<7.1–7.0) low.|$|E
25|$|Kula {{exchange}} {{is the only}} way for an individual to achieve local prestige without local political action. But this prestige is fleeting and does not transform into permanent differences in rank because women's participation is minor and Kula shells lack cosmological authentication. It is not Kula shells but women's cloth wealth that is connected with matrilineal ancestors. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that women retain high prestige and authority despite the fame of male Kula exchange players.|$|E
25|$|While {{it works}} in {{preventing}} speech, {{a person who has}} been stuff gagged can easily spit it out by pushing it with his/her tongue. However, it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that the stuff gag is one of the safest gags to use during self bondage, as the person with his/her hands tied can still spit the gag out if he/she feels any kind of discomfort. However, the risks of asphyxiation and choking are still present for someone who is not careful.|$|E
5000|$|Although real {{programs}} are rarely purely deterministic, it <b>is</b> easier <b>for</b> humans {{as well as}} other programs to reason about programs that <b>are.</b> <b>For</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason,</b> most programming languages and especially functional programming languages make an effort to prevent the above events from happening except under controlled conditions.|$|R
50|$|The family {{died out}} in the {{following}} century, after which the castle passed {{through a number of}} hands, without ever being refurbished. It therefore retains many original features, and it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that it <b>was</b> listed as a monument historique {{at the end of the}} twentieth century.|$|R
30|$|It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> {{that the}} Middlesborough Consensus {{recommended}} that a disposable Veress needle {{should be used}} in order to reliably hear these important clicks, which signify that these two layers have <b>been</b> penetrated, whereas <b>for</b> all other ports, reusable equipment could be justified on the grounds of economy.|$|R
25|$|The most {{accurate}} figures usually {{belong to the}} air arm fighting over its own territory, where many wrecks can be located, and even identified, and where shot down enemy are either killed or captured. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that at least 76 of the 80 aircraft credited to Manfred von Richthofen can be tied to known British losses—the German Jagdstaffeln flew defensively, on their own side of the lines, {{in part due to}} General Hugh Trenchard's policy of offensive patrol.|$|E
25|$|The {{subsequent}} sale of {{the track}} bed was postponed following {{the prospect of a}} number of schemes to re-open the closed section of the line. But they were all unsuccessful, and it <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that it took 15 years for the railway to become available to private buyers. Even so, certain covenants have been inserted into the deeds stating that there is to be no building on this land and it can be compulsorily purchased back should the need arise to reinstate the line.|$|E
25|$|The BEST bus routes {{are spread}} citywide and to {{neighboring}} cities. The BEST operates inter-city services to three areas beyond the municipal limits of Mumbai city, i.e., into {{the limits of}} the bordering corporations of Navi Mumbai, Thane & Mira - Bhayander. The BEST supplements suburban rails, which is the mass carrier on Mumbai region. It <b>is</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that BEST always gives priority for feeder routes over other routes. The BEST uses CNG and diesel powered buses for its operation. BEST introduced Air conditioned buses in 1998.|$|E
2500|$|Señorita was “pretty badly shaken up” {{during one}} {{run to the}} Cascades in 1858, when the {{hurricane}} deck was blown off, and other damage was sustained. [...] According to one source, it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason,</b> and high operation costs, that Señorita was soon thereafter withdrawn from service {{and sent to the}} scrapyard.|$|R
50|$|His {{part-owner}} Richard Burridge {{has stated}} that it <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that Desert Orchid would have struggled in the Grand National: connections felt he could do himself serious injury at the ninety-degree Canal Turn especially on the second circuit (ref. Richard Burridge: The Grey Horse: The True Story of Desert Orchid).|$|R
50|$|The Spanish {{defense of}} the colony {{consisted}} mostly of a citizen militia, not considered adequate by the authorities. With the aim of improving the army, they wanted a governor with military experience. It <b>was</b> <b>for</b> <b>this</b> <b>reason</b> that Alonso de Ribera received the appointment, with the mandate of organizing a professional army.|$|R
