50|$|The arch marimba was {{probably}} the first, followed by a simple instrument with a diatonic row of <b>wood</b> <b>bars</b> played with mallets, with gourd resonators, placed on a wooden a stand. In 1894 came a major breakthrough when Julián Paniagua Martínez and Sebastián Hurtado developed the chromatic marimba by adding to the diatonic row of sound bars, comparable to the white keys of the piano, a second row equivalent to the black keys.|$|R

The wood industries one in Chali, Pichkooban in Sartappeh and wood saturating factory that {{has been established in}} 1932 AD (1311 Iranian date) and because of less use of <b>wood</b> <b>bars</b> in rail way its production has been limited. Of course a kind of this factory has been made in Ghazvin province that only isolated the wood. So that was the first saturating factory in Iran.|$|R

25|$|Sandstone slip gate piers {{are found}} at the bottom entry point to the Buchans field beside the {{pedestrian}} footpath. Such slip gates were built {{with a series of}} downward facing 'L'-shaped grooves {{on one side and a}} matching concavity on the other gatepost. <b>Wood</b> <b>bars</b> could then be inserted across and parallel, giving a gate without a hinge. These are sometimes still found in the countryside at large, but they are almost always adapted to carry metal hinged gates. In some areas wood rather than stone was used to construct this type of hinge-less gatepost.|$|R

5000|$|The roneat ek (រនាតឯក; {{also called}} ronneat rut) is a {{xylophone}} {{used in the}} Khmer classical music of Cambodia. It is built {{in the shape of}} a curved, rectangular shaped boat. It has twenty-one thick bamboo or hard <b>wood</b> <b>bars</b> that are suspended from strings attached to the two walls. They are cut into pieces of the same width, but of different lengths and thickness. Originally these instruments were highly decorated with inlay and carvings on the sides of the sound box. Now they are simpler. It is one of the instruments used in the pinpeat ensemble. In that ensemble, it is placed to the right of the roneat thung, a lower-pitched xylophone. The roneat ek is the analogous equivalent to the Thai xylophone called ranat ek, and the Burmese bamboo xylophone called [...] "Pattalar".|$|R

5000|$|Bonnie is {{four years}} old in 1873. Spirited and willful, she has her father wrapped around her finger and giving into her every demand. Even Scarlett is jealous of the {{attention}} Bonnie gets. Rhett rides his horse around town with Bonnie in front of him, but Mammy insists it is not fitting for a girl to ride a horse with her dress flying up. Rhett heeds her words and buys Bonnie a Shetland pony, whom she names [...] "Mr. Butler," [...] and teaches her to ride sidesaddle. Then Rhett pays a boy named Wash twenty-five cents to teach Mr. Butler to jump over <b>wood</b> <b>bars.</b> When Mr. Butler is able to get his fat legs over a one-foot bar, Rhett puts Bonnie on the pony, and soon Mr. Butler is leaping bars and Aunt Melly's rose bushes.|$|R

5000|$|The Alley {{is one of}} {{the last}} {{remaining}} Oakland piano bars. It was founded in 1933. Most of the previous piano bars closed upwards of thirty years ago. The bar looks like a saloon or 1920s alleyway with wood shingles and windows in the interior. Writer Kimberly Chun has described the interior as being designed by [...] "a drunken Walt Disney". It has booths throughout it similar to those found at a diner. Approximately 40,000 to 50,000 business cards from visitors are displayed all over the walls, attached with staples. Business cards from Jerry Brown and Gregg Allman can be found. Dinner, which is served nightly, focuses on American cuisine such as steaks and burgers. An average steak dinner costs around $10. A piano is located past the main bar surrounded by a lacquered <b>wood</b> <b>bar.</b> Twelve seats sit at the bar and a pianist sits on the far end. Songbooks and microphones also rest on the bar. They primarily play songs from the Great American Songbook.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>wood</b> <b>bar</b> {{with square}} {{cross-section}} was biaxially compressed {{with respect to}} the cross-sectional plane and the impact 4 -point bending test was performed using the compressed wood. The wood material used was sap wood of Sugi, which is a kind of Japanese cedar. The biaxial compression apparatus which enabled to prevent the gap generation between the material and the tool was used. The fixation of wood specimen was also processed. The bar length was 100 mm and the edge length in cross-section was 15 ~ 25 mm. In the 4 -point bending test, the distance between the supports and the stress points were 80 mm and 40 mm. The stress points were impacted by a light-weight drop-hammer with 3. 0 kg mass. The impact velocity was 2 m/s. The surface strain was measured by a strain gage. When the Young’s modulus was estimated by assuming a linear elastic property, it attained about 32 GPa, which was more than 4 times of the uncompressed wood. The stress – strain hysteresis loop was more remarkable under the impact condition. It was found that the compressed wood provided not only a high rigidity, but also a good property in dissipation of vibration energy...|$|R

Insects such as the black swallowtail and the tiger swallowtail are also found there.|$|R
40|$|The {{transitional}} {{phenomenon of}} veneer thickness in successive cuts is, {{as pointed out}} by R. B. Hoadley in his reports, due to the the deflections caused in <b>wood</b> by pressure <b>bar</b> compression. In the previous report, these compressive deflections were determined experimentally, and in the present report, this transitional phenomenon was analyzed {{on the base of}} these experimental results...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{commanding}} officer (CO) was Lt Col Desmond <b>Woods</b> MC and <b>bar.</b> <b>Woods</b> {{had won the}} MC with the Royal Ulster Rifles in Palestine during 1938, at that time he was the youngest holder of the award.

In his earliest days as CO, Woods {{made it clear that he}} welcomed Catholics into his battalion. This was not welcomed by his former adjutant from the B Specials who, started a campaign to discourage former specials from joining. This man had been retained in the USC after the force was disbanded in order to ensure that all weapons were handed in, so he still had ample contact with the men in order to make his case.|$|R

5000|$|In the 1970s, he was {{initially}} {{influenced by the}} Russian Constructivist painters Vladimir Tatlin and Kazimir Malevich. He then became increasingly interested in installations, using <b>wood,</b> iron <b>bars,</b> tiles, rubber and other industrial materials. In his Axis Mundi (1980), he expressed the inner [...] "nirvana" [...] while attempting to depict the individual's outer view of the world. A trip to Japan in the 1980s inspired him to adaopt a more metaphysical approach to his work {{in line with the}} teachings of Zen Buddhism. [...] This is apparent in his Reflektor (2005) in Emdrup. Made of mirror glass, the work lies on the steps of an amphitheatre, depicting the effects of weather and time.|$|R
50|$|The {{interior}} {{is characterized by}} sloping floors with many of its original beams. Internal building partitions have been removed. The fireplaces display roughly cut granite lintels. The Smuggler's Bar in particular retains its 18th century feel with its large granite fireplace in the <b>bar</b> and dark <b>wood</b> beams. The <b>bar</b> area contains many old bank notes {{on the walls and}} various items such as brass or copper kettles and urns.|$|R
50|$|The rich social {{environment}} was {{coupled with a}} nostalgia inspired decor. The McDibbs rat served as the mascot for the establishment, often showing up {{on the covers of}} the monthly calendars showing the upcoming acts. The rat and its tambourine served as the 'hat' for compensation for artists on a night without a cover charge. A regular would sit at the <b>wood</b> grained <b>bar</b> facing a full mirrored bar. The only beer served was import and microbrewed beer. Bass ale, David Peele's unofficial favorite beer, among others, was often on tap or by the bottle. Also adding to the McDibbs atmosphere were winter plants. Asparagus ferns and Jade plants showed up behind the bar during the winter months. The atmosphere was not that of a typical bar, but of a hangout. Its this environment that is so often emulated in the Asheville area.|$|R
