While on a date with Rita, <b>Dexter</b> finds another crime scene in which the victim has been cut into pieces with no traces of blood; this time, however, the head is missing. <b>Dexter</b> theorizes that the killer murders his victims in extreme cold, explaining the absence of blood. <b>Dexter</b> further suggests that a stolen refrigerated truck is being used for the murders. <b>Dexter</b> allows Debra to pitch the theory, but their superior officer, Lt. María LaGuerta (Lauren Vélez), who dislikes Debra, dismisses it.|$|E
