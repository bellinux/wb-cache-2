40|$|Though the British and Dutch {{approaches}} to disability {{in the construction}} sector exhibit common features, Britain tends towards a capabilities model compared with the Netherlands which is closer to a social model. The construction sector is considerably more regulated in the Netherlands but is in both countries highly <b>disabling</b> <b>and</b> exclusive. Sector-specific <b>disabling</b> <b>and</b> enabling factors and policy measures were investigated {{in the two countries}} with a view to identifying which policies might facilitate labour market participation. The investigation was based on interviews using similar questionnaires with key stakeholders, firms <b>and</b> <b>disabled</b> employees <b>and</b> a focus group. Policy in each country addresses the nature of exclusion in different ways. The conclusion drawn is that a sector-specific approach is needed if disability policy in Britain is to be more in tune with the social model—as apparent from the comparison with the Netherlands.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 144 - 157). Compared to disciplines like {{gender and}} health, fewer {{studies have been}} done on <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women's participation in the informal sector. This may be {{explained by the fact that}} for a long time, few <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women in Uganda engaged or participated openly in income generating activities (IGAs). Many started getting involved in the 1990 's and as the available literature shows, those who have done so are very enthusiastic and this has encouraged others. This study focuses on the gender <b>and</b> work challenges <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women encounter in the informal sector of Uganda. The study is based on a review of existing literature and actual fieldwork carried out in the Mubende and Mityana districts of Uganda. It seeks to: (a) explore the types of business activities in which <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women are engaged; (b) explore the nature of work challenges <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women encounter in the informal sector and the nature of strategies they utilize to overcome these challenges; (c) ascertain the benefits that <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women have gained in respect of participation in the informal sector; (d) establish the policies and laws that govern <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women with regard to their work in the informal sector; and (e) establish how resources are allocated by various governmental and nongovernmental Organisations among <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women in Mubende and Mityana districts. The study was carried out in Mubende and Mityana district, the central region of the densely populated <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women. In this study in-depth interviews and focus group methods were used to collect qualitative data. Evidence from the study confirms that <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women were engaged in similar IGAs although a few of them were engaged in different IGAs. The similarity in IGAs was likely to be a result of the limited range of IGAs that <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women could engage in considering the nature of their impairments, limited finances and the limited skills that they had. The visually and hearing impaired men and women were mainly involved in a single IGA in the informal sector and most of the physically <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women were engaged in multiple IGAs. This was linked to visually and hearing impaired men and women lacking or having insufficient capital and skills to engage in multiple IGAs, as compared to physically <b>disabled</b> men <b>and</b> women...|$|R
