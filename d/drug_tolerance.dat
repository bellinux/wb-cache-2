25|$|Pain is {{typically}} treated with opioids, varying in potency {{based on the}} severity of symptoms. When opioids are used for prolonged periods, <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance,</b> chemical dependency, and addiction may occur. Opiate addiction is not typically a concern since the condition {{is not likely to}} ever completely disappear. Thus, lifelong treatment with opioids is fairly common for chronic pain symptoms, accompanied by periodic titration that is typical of any long-term opioid regimen.|$|E
25|$|Tolerance {{may occur}} to {{quazepam}} but {{more slowly than}} seen with other benzodiazepines such as triazolam. However, quazepam causes significantly less <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance</b> and less withdrawal symptoms including less rebound insomnia upon discontinuation compared to other benzodiazepines. Quazepam may cause less rebound effects than other type1 benzodiazepine receptor selective nonbenzodiazepine drugs due to its longer half-life. Short-acting hypnotics often cause next day rebound anxiety. Quazepam due to its pharmacological profile does not cause next day rebound withdrawal effects during treatment.|$|E
30|$|Discussion Adequate {{sedation}} {{is important}} in paediatric intensive care. By contrast, oversedation promotes <b>drugs</b> <b>tolerance</b> and withdrawal leading to a delayed recovery. In the effort to reduce prolonged opioid and benzodiazepine exposure, we introduced clonidine in our sedation protocol. We found an acceptable side-effects profile and a clinical efficacy both in ventilated and in non-ventilated patients. Our data also confirm a benzodiazepine and opioid sparing effect of clonidine, with significant reduction in midazolam and morphine consumption.|$|R

40|$|Aim. To {{develop a}} test on {{tolerability}} of small alcohol doses (SAD), to study hemodynamic and vestibular changes induced by SAD during mono- and combined antihypertensive therapy. Material and methods. 30 healthy volunteers and 292 patients with arterial hypertension 1 - 2 stages {{were involved in}} the study. Tolerance to SAD was estimated in untreated hypertensive patients (n= 77), patients receiving one (n= 218), two (n= 46) and three (n= 28) antihypertensive <b>drugs.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> to SAD was evaluated by blood pressure changes as well as change of upright body balance and subjective sensations of the patient. Results. Hypotension and circulatory vestibular disorders can be induced by alcohol consumption during antihypertensive therapy. These disorders appear more often due to peripheral vasodilators as well as combined antihypertensive therapy. Conclusion. It is necessary to inform the patient about risk of alcohol taking and necessity to restrict of its dose during antihypertensive therapy. </p...|$|R
25|$|Withdrawal {{symptoms}} are a normal response in individuals having chronically used benzodiazepines, and an adverse effect and result of <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance.</b> Symptoms typically emerge when dosage {{of the drug}} is reduced. GABA is the second-most-common neurotransmitter in {{the central nervous system}} (the most common being glutamate) and by far the most abundant inhibitory neurotransmitter; roughly one-quarter to one-third of synapses use GABA. The use of benzodiazepines has a profound effect on almost every aspect of brain and body function, either directly or indirectly.|$|E
25|$|Caffeine also {{causes the}} release of {{dopamine}} in the dorsal striatum and nucleus accumbens core (a substructure within the ventral striatum), but not the nucleus accumbens shell, by antagonizing A1 receptors in the axon terminal of dopamine neurons and A1–A2A heterodimers (a receptor complex composed of 1 adenosine A1 receptor and 1 adenosine A2A receptor) in the axon terminal of glutamate neurons. During chronic caffeine use, caffeine-induced dopamine release within the nucleus accumbens core is markedly reduced due to <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance.</b>|$|E
25|$|DCC is {{expressed}} {{at very low}} levels {{through most of the}} body but at higher levels {{in many areas of the}} brain, particularly in dopamine neurons.

40|$|Rats {{were made}} {{tolerant}} to dermorphin or to morphine by continuous ICV infusion of these <b>drugs.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> to the analgesic effect {{was assessed by}} evaluating the shift of the ED 50 of dermorphin or morphine in dermorphin-infused or in morphine-infused animal respectively, after single doses of these opioids. Tolerance to catalepsy was revealed with the significant reduction of this effect after single ICV dose of morphine in morphine-infused and dermorphin in dermorphin-infused rats. Both dermorphin and morphine induced tolerance to the analgesic and cataleptic effects. Acute administration (SC and ICV) of morphine in DER-tolerant rats induced a significant decrease of the analgesic and cataleptic effects of this opioid, showing the onset of cross-tolerance between morphine and dermorphin. Acute injections of dermorphin (ICV) in MOR-tolerant rats, while significantly decreasing its analgesic potency, indicating the development of cross-tolerance, did not modify the cataleptic response to the peptide, showing that no cross-tolerance was present to this effect...|$|R
40|$|Over the 75 -year {{lifetime}} of the British Pharmacological Society {{there has been}} an enormous expansion in our understanding of how opioid drugs act on the nervous system, with much of this effort aimed at developing powerful analgesic drugs devoid of the side effects associated with morphine – the Holy Grail of opioid research. At the molecular and cellular level multiple opioid receptors have been cloned and characterised, their potential for oligomerisation determined, a large family of endogenous opioid agonists has been discovered, multiple second messengers identified and our understanding of the adaptive changes to prolonged exposure to opioid <b>drugs</b> (<b>tolerance</b> and physical dependence) enhanced. In addition, we now have greater understanding of the processes by which opioids produce the euphoria that gives rise to the intense craving for these drugs in opioid addicts.

25|$|Adverse {{effects of}} benzodiazepines such as {{diazepam}} include anterograde amnesia and confusion (especially pronounced in higher doses) and sedation. The elderly {{are more prone}} to adverse effects of diazepam, such as confusion, amnesia, ataxia, and hangover effects, as well as falls. Long-term use of benzodiazepines such as diazepam is associated with <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance,</b> benzodiazepine dependence, and benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome. Like other benzodiazepines, diazepam can impair short-term memory and learning of new information. While benzodiazepine drugs such as diazepam can cause anterograde amnesia, they do not cause retrograde amnesia; information learned before using benzodiazepines is not impaired. Tolerance to the cognitive-impairing effects of benzodiazepines does not tend to develop with long-term use, and the elderly are more sensitive to them. Additionally, after cessation of benzodiazepines, cognitive deficits may persist for at least six months; it is unclear whether these impairments take longer than six months to abate or if they are permanent. Benzodiazepines may also cause or worsen depression. Infusions or repeated intravenous injections of diazepam when managing seizures, for example, may lead to drug toxicity, including respiratory depression, sedation and hypotension. <b>Drug</b> <b>tolerance</b> may also develop to infusions of diazepam if it is given for longer than 24 hours. Adverse effects such as sedation, benzodiazepine dependence, and abuse potential limit the use of benzodiazepines.|$|E
25|$|When used appropriately, opioids {{and other}} central analgesics are {{otherwise}} safe and effective, however risks such as addiction and the body's becoming {{used to the}} <b>drug</b> (<b>tolerance)</b> can occur. The effect of tolerance means that frequent use of the drug may result in its diminished effect so, when safe to do so, the dosage {{may need to be}} increased to maintain effectiveness. This may be of particular concern regarding patients suffering with chronic pain. Opioid tolerance is often addressed with opioid rotation therapy in which a patient is routinely switched between two or more non-cross-tolerant opioid medications in order to prevent exceeding safe dosages in the attempt to achieve an adequate analgesic effect.|$|E
25|$|Opium {{contains}} two main groups of alkaloids. Phenanthrenes such as morphine, codeine, and thebaine {{are the main}} psychoactive constituents. Isoquinolines such as papaverine and noscapine have no significant central nervous system effects, and are not regulated under the Controlled Substances Act. Morphine is the most prevalent and important alkaloid in opium, consisting of 10–16 percent of the total, and is {{responsible for most of}} its harmful effects such as lung edema, respiratory difficulties, coma, or cardiac or respiratory collapse. Morphine binds to and activates mu opioid receptor in the brain, spinal cord, stomach and intestine. Regular use can lead to <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance</b> or physical dependence. Chronic opium addicts in 1906 China or modern-day Iran consume an average of eight grams of opium daily.|$|E

40|$|International audienceA major {{challenge}} in transplantation medicine is controlling the very strong immune responses to foreign antigens {{that are responsible}} for graft rejection. Although immunosuppressive drugs efficiently inhibit acute graft rejection, a substantial proportion of patients suffer chronic rejection that ultimately leads to functional loss of the graft. Induction of immunological tolerance to transplants would avoid rejection and the need for lifelong treatment with immunosuppressive <b>drugs.</b> <b>Tolerance</b> to self-antigens is ensured naturally by several mechanisms; one major mechanism depends on the activity of regulatory T lymphocytes. Here we show that in mice treated with clinically acceptable levels of irradiation, regulatory CD 4 +CD 25 +Foxp 3 + T cells stimulated in vitro with alloantigens induced long-term tolerance to bone marrow and subsequent skin and cardiac allografts. Regulatory T cells specific for directly presented donor antigens prevented only acute rejection, despite hematopoietic chimerism. By contrast, regulatory T cells specific for both directly and indirectly presented alloantigens prevented both acute and chronic rejection. Our findings demonstrate the potential of appropriately stimulated regulatory T cells for future cell-based therapeutic approaches to induce lifelong immunological tolerance to allogeneic transplants...|$|R
25|$|Chronic or {{excessive}} use of temazepam may cause <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance,</b> which can develop rapidly, so this drug is not recommended for long-term use. In 1979, the Institute of Medicine (USA) and the National Institute on Drug Abuse stated that most hypnotics lose their sleep-inducing properties after about three to 14 days. In use longer than one to two weeks, tolerance will rapidly develop towards the ability of temazepam to maintain sleep, resulting {{in a loss of}} effectiveness. Some studies have observed tolerance to temazepam after as little as one week's use. Another study examined the short-term effects of the accumulation of temazepam over seven days in elderly inpatients, and found little tolerance developed during the accumulation of the drug. Other studies examined the use of temazepam over six days and saw no evidence of tolerance. A study in 11 young male subjects showed significant tolerance occurs to temazepam's thermoregulatory effects and sleep inducing properties after one week of use of 30-mg temazepam. Body temperature is well correlated with the sleep-inducing or insomnia-promoting properties of drugs.|$|E
25|$|Quazepam is {{selective}} for type I benzodiazepine receptors containing the α1 subunit, {{similar to other}} drugs such as zaleplon and zolpidem. As a result, quazepam {{has little or no}} muscle relaxant properties. Most other benzodiazepines are unselective and bind to type1 GABAA receptors and type2 GABAA receptors. Type1 GABAA receptors include the α1 subunit containing GABAA receptors which are responsible for hypnotic properties of the drug. Type 2 receptors include the α2, α3 and α5 subunits which are responsible for anxiolytic action, amnesia and muscle relaxant properties. Thus quazepam may have less side effects than other benzodiazepines but, it has a very long half-life of 25 hours which reduces its benefits as a hypnotic due to likely next day sedation. It also has two active metabolites with half-lives of 28 and 79 hours. Quazepam may also cause less <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance</b> than other benzodiazepines such as temazepam and triazolam perhaps due to its subtype selectivity. The longer half-life of quazepam may have the advantage however, of causing less rebound insomnia than shorter acting subtype selective nonbenzodiazepines. However, one of the major metabolites of quazepam, the N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam (aka N-desalkylflurazepam), binds unselectively to both type1 and type2 GABAA receptors. The N-desmethyl-2-oxoquazepam metabolite also has a very long half-life and likely contributes to the pharmacological effects of quazepam.|$|E
500|$|In {{the reward}} system, reward is the {{attractive}} and motivational property of a stimulus that induces appetitive behavior [...] (also known as approach behavior) – and consummatory behavior. A rewarding stimulus {{is one that}} has the potential to cause an approach to it and a choice to be made to consume it or not. Pleasure, learning (e.g., classical and operant conditioning), and approach behavior are the three main functions of reward. As an aspect of reward, pleasure provides a definition of reward; however, while all pleasurable stimuli are rewarding, not all rewarding stimuli are pleasurable (e.g., extrinstic rewards like money). The motivational or desirable aspect of rewarding stimuli is reflected by the approach behavior that they induce, whereas the pleasurable component of intrinstic rewards is derived from the consummatory behavior that ensues upon acquiring them. [...] A neuropsychological model which distinguishes these two components of an intrinsically rewarding stimulus is the incentive salience model, where [...] "wanting" [...] or desire (less commonly, [...] "seeking") corresponds to appetitive or approach behavior while [...] "liking" [...] or pleasure corresponds to consummatory behavior.}} In human drug addicts, [...] "wanting" [...] becomes dissociated with [...] "liking" [...] as the desire to use an addictive drug increases, while the pleasure obtained from consuming it decreases due to <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance.</b>|$|E
40|$|Medicine has become, {{and will}} {{continue}} to become, much more a science, not less, so that the physician of tomorrow will have to be more a scientific, not less. Nevertheless, the art of medicine remains, and the physician must continue to be wise and understanding with a deep respect for the patient as a human being. The secret of success in the care of the patient is still in carrying for the patient. The physician must always have a reasonably clear-cut indication for the administration of any drug. No drug should ever be given until the physician has determined whether or not the patient is sensitive to it. If a drug sensitive exists, the fact should be noted prominently. The careful physician also avoids drugs which might further complicate his patient´s probleme. Many factors can influence that patient´s response to a drug, including age of the patient, disease of the organs of drug elimination (kidney, liver), the concurent use of other drugs, foods, and chemicals (drug interactions), previous therapy with the same <b>drugs</b> (<b>tolerance),</b> and a variety of genetic factors that can influence the kinetics and toxicity of drugs (pharmacogenetics) ...|$|R

50|$|A {{significant}} {{advantage of}} inhibiting {{the breakdown of}} endogenous opioid peptides rather than stimulating opioid receptors with exogenous drugs is that the levels of opioid peptides are only increased slightly from natural levels, thus avoiding overstimulation and downregulation of the opioid receptors.

40|$|Tolerance and {{sensitization}} {{are relatively}} simple manifestations {{of learning and}} memory that refer to decreases and increases in {{the strength of a}} response to a stimulus induced by past experiences with the same or related stimuli. In the context of the study of <b>drugs,</b> <b>tolerance</b> refers to the decreased effectiveness of a given drug with repeated administration; sensitization to the increased effectiveness with repeated administration. Tolerance usually involves active adjustments or adaptation to the drug-induce disturbances of function, either within cells or within a neural system. In situations involving inter-neuronal events, these processes of adjustment may take the form of learned modifications that can be re-evoked on future occasions by events that co-occurred {{at the time of the}} original modifications. Sensitization, defined as the enhancement of a directly elicited drug effect, though adaptive, appears to represent facilitation within a system, making the effect easier to elicit on future occasions. Like tolerance, sensitization of a drug effect can become linked to the events that co-occurred when the effect was originally elicited, making it possible for sensitization to come under selective event control. This paper is concerned with factors that affect whether tolerance and/or sensitization to the various effects of drugs will develop and be expressed, and with the variety and levels of mechanisms responsible for tolerance and sensitization under different conditions of exposure...|$|R
2500|$|Very rare {{causes of}} {{awareness}} include <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance,</b> or a tolerance {{induced by the}} interaction of other drugs.

There may be genetic variations that cause differences in how quickly patients clear anesthetics, and there may be differences in how the sexes react to anesthetics as well. In addition, anesthetic requirement is increased in persons with naturally red hair. Marked anxiety prior to the surgery can increase the amount of anesthesia required to prevent recall.|$|E
2500|$|Benzodiazepines such as {{clonazepam}} are {{an alternative}} to SSRIs. These drugs are often used for short-term relief of severe, disabling anxiety.

It has been recommended that benzodiazepines be [...] considered only for individuals who fail to respond to other medications. Benzodiazepines augment the action of GABA, the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain; effects usually begin to appear within minutes or hours. [...] In most patients, tolerance rapidly develops to the sedative effects of benzodiazepines, {{but not to the}} anxiolytic effects. Long-term use of benzodiazepine may result in physical dependence, and abrupt discontinuation of the drug should be avoided due to high potential for withdrawal symptoms (including tremor, insomnia, and in rare cases, seizures). A gradual tapering of the dose of clonazepam (a decrease of 0.25mg every 2 weeks), however, {{has been shown to be}} well tolerated by patients with social anxiety disorder. Benzodiazepines are not recommended as monotherapy for patients who have major depression in addition to social anxiety disorder and should be avoided in patients with a history of substance abuse.|$|E
2500|$|Neuroscientists, pharmacologists, {{molecular}} biologists, {{and other}} researchers in related fields have identified the transcriptional and epigenetic mechanisms of addiction pathophysiology. Diagnostic models, which use the pharmacological model of addiction (this model associates addiction with drug-related concepts, particularly physical dependence, drug withdrawal, and <b>drug</b> <b>tolerance),</b> do not currently include diagnostic criteria to identify sexual addictions in a clinical setting. [...] In the brain disease model of addiction, which uses neuropsychological concepts to characterize addictions, sexual addictions are identifiable and well-characterized. In this model, addictive drugs are characterized as those which are both reinforcing and rewarding.Dependence is defined as an adaptive state that develops in response to repeated drug administration, and is unmasked during withdrawal, which occurs when drug taking stops. Dependence from long-term drug use may have both a somatic component, manifested by physical symptoms, and an emotional–motivation component, manifested by dysphoria. [...] While physical dependence and withdrawal occur with some drugs of abuse (opiates, ethanol), these phenomena are not useful in the diagnosis of addiction {{because they do not}} occur with other drugs of abuse (cocaine, amphetamine) and can occur with many drugs that are not abused (propranolol, clonidine). [...] The official diagnosis of drug addiction by the Diagnostic and Statistic Manual of Mental Disorders (2000), which makes distinctions between drug use, abuse, and substance dependence, is flawed. First, diagnosis of drug use versus abuse can be arbitrary and reflect cultural norms, not medical phenomena. [...] Second, the term substance dependence implies that dependence is the primary pharmacologic phenomenon underlying addiction, which is likely not true, as tolerance, sensitization, and learning and memory also play central roles. It is ironic and unfornate that the Manual avoids use of the term addiction, which provides the best description of the clinical syndrome.}} [...] Addictive behaviors (those which can induce a compulsive state) are similarly identified and characterized by their rewarding and reinforcing properties.|$|E

40|$|International audienceVacuolar H+-ATPases (V-ATPases) are a {{specific}} class of multisubunit pumps that play {{an essential role}} in the generation of proton gradients across eukaryotic endomembranes. Another simpler proton pump that co-localises with the V-ATPase occurs in plants and many protists: the single-subunit H+-translocating inorganic pyrophosphatase (H+-PPase). Little is known about the relative contribution of these two proteins to the acidification of intracellular compartments. Here, we show that the expression of a chimaeric derivative of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase AVP 1 that is preferentially targeted to internal membranes of yeast alleviates the phenotypes associated with V-ATPase deficiency. Phenotypic complementation was achieved both with a yeast strain with its V-ATPase specifically inhibited by bafilomycin A 1 and with a vma 1 null mutant lacking a catalytic V-ATPase subunit. Cell staining with vital fluorescent dyes showed that AVP 1 recovered vacuole acidification and normalised the endocytic pathway of the vma mutant. Biochemical and immunochemical studies further demonstrated that a significant fraction of heterologous H+-PPase is located at the vacuolar membrane. These results raise the question of the occurrence of distinct proton pumps in certain single-membrane organelles, such as plant vacuoles, by proving yeast V-ATPase activity dispensability and the capability of H+-PPase to generate by itself physiologically suitable internal pH gradients. Besides, they envisage new ways of engineering macrolide <b>drugs</b> <b>tolerance</b> and outline an experimental system for testing alternative roles for fungal and animal V-ATPases, other than the mere acidification of subcellular organelles...|$|R
