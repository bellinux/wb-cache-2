Three hundred ninety-three resected specimens of HCC were examined for tumor thrombosis in the portal vein and the hepatic vein: 231 tumors <- 5 cm in diameter were examined for the relationship between mode of tumor spread and tumor size. Efferent vessels in HCC were identified by direct injection of radiopaque material into the tumor in 23 resected liver specimens and by percutaneous infusion of radiopaque media into tumor nodules in 8 patients. The mode of tumor spread in HCC progressed from capsular invasion to extracapsular invasion, then to vascular invasion, and finally to intrahepatic metastasis. There was a strong statistical correlation between the presence of intrahepatic metastasis and portal vein thrombosis (p< 0. 05, R= 0. 998). Radiopaque material injected directly into 23 resected tumors entered only the portal vein in 17 tumors and into both the portal and hepatic veins in 6 tumors. In all 8 patients with unresectable lesions, radiopaque media injected percutaneously into tumor nodules flowed only into the portal vein. These findings suggest that intrahepatic invasion by HCC may occur through the portal vein as an efferent tumor vessel.

40|$|That {{gangrene}} {{can result}} from venous obstruc-tion, although rare, is not widely realized. A preliminary and brief examination of its genesis is worth while. As Learmonth (I 950) pointed out, among other factors, the viability of tissue depends on an adequate rate of blood flow through the capillaries. Interference with the blood flow maybe caused by a lesion in (i) the <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> or artery, (2) the capillary itself, (3) the afferent vessel or vein, (4) some combination of the preceding.

40|$|The {{expression}} of glutamine synthetase (GS) {{is confined to}} a rim of hepatocytes surrounding the efferent hepatic veins in all mammalian species investigated. In rat liver, a two- to three-cell thick layer of GS-positive (GS(+)) hepatocytes uniformly surrounds the two to four terminal branching generations of the hepatic vein that collect blood from sinusoids (central veins). With increasing diameter of the <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel,</b> this multilayered rim of GS(+) hepatocytes becomes confined to patches surrounding {{the decreasing number of}} central vein outlets. The remaining part of the wall of these sublobar hepatic veins is bordered by a one-cell thick layer of GS(+) hepatocytes. Around still larger veins, this single-cell layer of GS(+) hepatocytes gradually disappears. The expression pattern of GS is therefore a convenient biological parameter to delimit sinusoidal draining ("collecting") from nondraining ("conducting") surfaces in the wall of the efferent hepatic vessels. The hepatocytes surrounding a single tree of central veins together form a compound liver lobule. (J Histochem Cytochem 47 : 1507 - 1511, 1999...|$|E

40|$|Coil {{occlusion}} of intracranial aneurysms, both ruptured and unruptured, is {{safe and}} efficacious if patient selection and endovascular treatment are carried out adequately (Raymond et al. 1997, Roy et al. 2001, Pierot et al. 2008, Spetzler et al. 2013). A major limitation for this treatment modality {{is related to the}} geometry of the target aneurysm. A neck of ≥ 4 mm and a fundus width/neck ratio ≤ 1 mm are unfavorable for simple coiling (Brinjikji et al. 2009). Intraluminal flow diversion has solved this issue for sidewall aneurysms (Fischer et al. 2011). Intraaneurysmal flow disrupter (e. g., WEB, Sequent Medical; LUNA, nFocus/Covidien) are promising but not yet fully established devices for selected bifurcation aneurysms (Klisch et al. 2011, Pierot et al. 2012, Lubicz et al. 2013, Pierot et al. 2013). For WNBAs, the techniques to assist coil occlusion include single or crossing stent deployment and balloon remodeling (Lubicz et al. 2009, Moret et al. 1997), both requiring catheter access to at least one <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> of the bifurcation. This catheterization can sometimes be difficult. Coil assist techniques without <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> access include TriSpan device (Raymond et al. 2001), which is no longer available, and the deployment of self-expanding stents with their distal end inside the aneurysm, the so-called “waffle cone” technique (Horowitz et al. 2006). The stents used for the “waffle cone” technique (e. g., Solitaire AB, Covidien; Enterprise, Codman) are not optimized for this purpose and are far from ideal. pCONus® (phenox) is a dedicated neurovascular device, which was designed to address the functional needs of an extra-intrasaccular neck bridging aneurysm implant to assist the coil occlusion of WNBAs. The present thesis summarizes the in vitro study of the device, its initial use in 9 New Zealand White Rabbits as well as the angiographic and clinical results in the endovascular treatment of 50 intracranial aneurysms. In the clinical use of pCONus® we refer to the initial state of the patient, the angiographic outcome of the treatment session, possible complications and clinical outcome after the treatment.

40|$|Because the {{viability}} of the gill withdrawal reflex is dependent on age in Aplysia, we examined physiologic and morphometric properties of two motor neurons, L 7 and LDG 1, involved in the reflex in three postmetamorphic age groups: young, mature, and old. L 7 's capability to elicit pinnule contraction, a major component of the reflex, was reduced markedly in old gills; facilitation at old L 7 terminals, upon which contraction is dependent, was significantly reduced. The morphology of the pinnule neuromuscular junctions changed with increased age. In contrast, LDG 1 's capability to elicit <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> contraction, a major component of respiratory movements, was not significantly altered by age; facilitation also was relatively unaffected; and morphologic changes at neuromuscular junctions were poorly correlated with age. Aging occurs differentially in two motor neurons innervating the gill.

40|$|Hypertension, by definition, is a hemodynamic disorder. A high {{cardiac output}} and a normal {{systemic}} vascular resis-tance characterize the young hypertensive patient. As hy-pertension progresses, resistance becomes progressively elevated and cardiac output returns to normal. The elderly patient with hypertension has very high systemic vascular resistance and low cardiac output. Antihypertensive drugs {{should not only}} lower arterial pressure but also bring other hemodynamic parameters as well as functional and struc-tural changes of the cardiovascular system back to normal. With the notable exception of the classic -blockers, all antihypertensive drug classes, including the vasodilating -blockers, increase or maintain cardiac output and lower systemic vascular resistance. Calcium antagonists, al-though a very heterogeneous group, {{have been shown to}} have a similar effect on systemic hemodynamics. Initially, the short-acting agents (even verapamil) produce a reflex increase in heart rate and cardiac output with a decrease in systemic vascular resistance. This reflexive cardiac accel-eration is not seen with the extended-release or longer-acting formulations, which usually maintain cardiac output and decrease systemic resistance. Lercanidipine is a novel calcium antagonist that has been shown to differ from other dihydropyridines in that the incidence of vasodila-tory edema for any given decrease in blood pressure is less pronounced. Whereas all dihydropyridine calcium antag-onists dilate the afferent arteriole in the kidney, preclinical studies have shown that lercanidipine also produces dilation of the <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel.</b> Similar balanced pre- and postcapillary vasodilation may be an explanation for the lower incidence of vasodilatory edema seen clinically with lercanidipine.

The purpose of this study was to investigate geometrical changes caused by closed-cell design stents in bifurcation and sidewall aneurysms. 31 patients with 34 aneurysms underwent SACE with closed-cell design stents. Inflow angle α, determined by aneurysm neck and afferent vessel, and angle between afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> close to (δ 1), respectively, more remote from the aneurysm neck (δ 2) were graphically determined in 2 D angiography projections. Stent assisted coiling resulted in a significant increase of all three angles from a mean value (±SEM) of α = 119 ° (± 6. 5 °) pretreatment to 130 ° (± 6. 6 °) posttreatment (P ≤. 001), δ 1 = 129 ° (± 6. 4 °) to 139 ° (± 6. 1 °), (P ≤. 001) and δ 2 = 115 ° (± 8. 4 °) to 126 ° (± 7. 5 °), (P ≤. 01). Angular change of δ 1 in AcomA aneurysms was significant greater compared to sidewall aneurysms (26 °± 4. 9 ° versus 8 °± 2. 3 °, P ≤. 05). The initial angle of δ 1 and δ 2 revealed a significantly inverse relationship to the angle increase (δ 1 : r = - 0. 41, P ≤. 05 and δ 2 : r = - 0. 47, P ≤. 01). Moreover, angle δ 1 was significantly higher in unruptured compared to ruptured aneurysms (135 °± 7. 1 ° versus 103 °± 10. 8 °, P ≤. 05). Stent deployment modulates the geometry of the aneurysm-vessel complex, which may lead to favorable hemodynamic changes more similar to unruptured than to ruptured aneurysms. Our findings also suggest that the more acute-angled aneurysm-vessel anatomy, the larger the angular change. Further studies are needed to investigate whether these changes improve the clinical outcome...|$|E
40|$|The New Zealand {{freshwater}} crayfish P. zealandicus emerges from water and exposes it's respiratory surface to desiccation and collapse, it's haemolymph to acid-base disturbance and it's tissues to hypoxia. This {{study was to}} investigate the respiratory system during aerial respiration. P. zealandicus has 20 gills, a rudimentary gill and an epipodite (20 + r + ep). Two types of gill filament were identified; a respiratory filament with a cuticle 0. 7 µm thick, an afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel</b> and haemolymph lacunae adjacent to the cuticle, and an ion regulating filament with a cuticle 1. 2 µm thick in which the cells adjacent to the cuticle contain all the organelles and membranes which are associated with ion regulating tissues. It was found that P. zealandicus emerged from the water voluntarily. There {{was no significant difference in}} the frequency of emersion by solo crayfish at 18 °C, crayfish pairs at 18 °C, solo crayfish experiencing hypoxia at l 8 °C, and solo crayfish at 24 °C. Solo crayfish and crayfish pairs recorded a significantly higher level of emersion activity at night than during the daytime. At 15 °C the settled rate of oxygen consumption in air, 1. 03 ± 0. 03 µmol. g- 1. h- 1 (± 1 sem), was not significantly different from the settled rate of oxygen consumption in water, 1. 10 ± 0. 03 µmol. g- 1. h- 1. Oxygen consumption in water was compromised by declining external oxygen tension below PCR 1 T (41 - 44 Torr). At PCR 1 T the oxygen consumption was 1. 06 ± 0. 05 /lffi 01. g- 1. h- 1 At only one time in 48 hours aerial respiration was haemo 1 ymph arterial oxygen tension below PCRIT. This was after 12 hours aerial respiration, and was associated with an increase in lactate concentration to 5 mmol. 1 - 1, which was, however, removed during the subsequent 12 hours aerial respiration. The crayfish were not considered to be experiencing internal hypoxia for the remainder of the 48 hours in air. The total oxygen consumed during 8 hours recovering from aerial respiration was similar to the total oxygen consumed during the 8 hours settling at the beginning of the experiment, indicating no measurable oxygen debt accumulated during 48 hours aerial respiration. After emersion into air the crayfish experienced a respiratory acidosis, and an elevated arterial carbon-dioxide tension. Total haemolymph carbonates, measured 12 hours after emerging from water indicated compensation by metabolic alkalosis. Upon returning to the water the crayfish experienced a respiratory alkalosis. Rapidly declining arterial carbon-dioxide tension, and total haemolymph carbonates indicated compensation by metabolic acidosis. The measured in vitro non-bicarbonate buffer capacity was - 3. 8 mmol. - 1. (pH unit) - 1. During the 48 hours in air the pH was regulated between 7. 55 and 7. 68 with the pH significantly more alkaline at 8 pm than at 8 am, by 0. 1 pH units. At 15 °C, the solubility of oxygen in haemolymph, ±PLASMAO 2, was 1. 8 µmol. 1 - 1. Torr- 1, and at an oxygen tension of 150 Torr the total haemolymph oxygen content was 1 mmol. 1 - 1. There was a Bohr effect, ΔlogP 50 /ΔpH, of - 0. 48 to -, 0. 96. Settled in water at 15 °C, with a haemolymph carbon-dioxide tension of 2. 6 Torr, the crayfish haemocyanin was 50 % saturated at an oxygen tension of 12 Torr. Crayfish kept at 15 °C had an oxygen content when the haemocyanin was 50 % saturated, and a total oxygen content, which were 50 % higher than crayfish from water at 9. 5 °C. Estimates of limitation to diffusion/perfusion, Ldiff, in water of 0. 76, and in air of 0. 98, indicate that respiration in P. zealandicus is diffusion limited. The respiratory frequency, fR, and heart frequency, fH, of settled crayfish in air was not significantly different from settled crayfish in water. The fH during aerial respiration demonstrated less fluctuation than fH in control crayfish in water, and the fR of crayfish in air was more variable than the fR in control crayfish in water. The control crayfish settled in water exhibited a significant diel fluctuation in fR and fH, with high fR and fH recorded in the evening and low fR and fH in the morning. Several activities and changes measured in this study have a diel rhythm. A dusk pH recorded at 8 pm. was 0. 1 pH units more alkaline than a dawn pH recorded at 8 am. Settled in water, P. zealandicus exhibits a diel fluctuation in fR and fH, with high fR and fH recorded in the evening and low fR and fH in the morning. At 18 °C, solitary crayfish and crayfish pairs show higher levels of emersion activity at night than during the daytime. The results indicate that crayfish P. zealandicus has a respiratory system which can cope with aerial respiration, and some of the activities and changes reported in this study have a diel rhythm...|$|E

30|$|The {{choice to}} use a liquid embolic agent mainly {{combined}} with other agents (coils) for TE in various abdominal diseases was made to maximize the embolizing power with a good level of safety, owing to the poor tendency of the polymerized agent to migrate towards off target sites. Squid is a non-adhesive liquid embolic agent well known in cerebral field but with poor application in abdominal district (Erbahceci et al., 2014). It is composed of ethylene vinyl alcohol (EVOH) copolymer dissolved in dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and micronized tantalum powder for radiopacity. Differently from the other most known EVOH-based liquid embolic agent Onyx, Squid is available in different combinations, with Squid- 12 characterized by low density and viscosity. Squid- 18, such as in case of Onyx use, is suggested for initial plug formation, while the new formulation Squid- 12 can improve vascular penetration and spread more distally. Another advantage of Squid over Onyx {{is related to the}} reduced percentage (30 %) of tantalum which can improve vessels visualization during embolization and limit metallic artifacts at imaging follow-up (Gioppo et al., 2017), as also recently demonstrated (Pop et al., 2018). Squid was always administered using DMSO-compatible coaxial microcatheters as straight Renegade Hi-flo (Boston) or curved Carnelian (Tokai): the peculiar cobra-shaped tip of Carnelian was useful in selected cases of marked tortuosity of the target artery, as for example in VAA (splenic) or type 2 endoleak embolization. No technical problems, such as microcatheter entrapment, were recorded. In the present study on 30 patients affected by different abdominal diseases, both formulations of Squid were used. Squid- 12 was largely used in right PVE to embolize also the medium-peripheral branches of the right portal vein, usually after PVA particles administration. Embolization with Squid- 18 was preferred in VAAs and AVMs usually combined with coils and PVA particles, respectively. The use of Squid, in association with other embolic agents, does not represent a limitation but rather a valid option, which increases the embolizing power. For example, in 6 patients submitted to VAA embolization using Squid and coils the occlusion process of the target artery was very rapid. According to the isolation technique (Ikeda et al., 2010), VAA embolization was successfully performed embolizing subsequently the <b>efferent</b> <b>vessel,</b> the aneurysmatic sac and the afferent vessel: Squid- 18 slowly injected through the microcatheter during its careful retraction was able to produce a stable plug into the target artery strengthening the embolizing action of the coils: coils provide the support, while Squid can fill the hollows between the coils. In 2 patients affected by splenic artery aneurysms, a transient amylases increase after the procedure, conditioning a prolonged hospitalization of 24 [*]h but spontaneously resolved, was recorded. It was probably caused by an accidental infusion of DSMO, differently from Squid not radiopaque and thus undetectable on fluoroscopy, in small pancreatic branches arising from the splenic artery. Pancreatic branches are probably more sensitive than other arteries to the DMSO toxicity (Pamuk et al., 2005). DMSO-infusion, which precedes Squid administration, must be performed very slowly. In our series of 5 patients, AVMs embolization strategy was initially based on PVA particles to determine nidus or microcirculation hypoxia, followed by Squid- 18 to occlude the feeding arteries. In AVMs, it is mandatory before Squid administration to embolize nidus using PVA particles or embosphere (Merit Medical, Jordan, Utah, USA): the lack of peripheral occlusion with proximal embolization alone can favor collaterals formation from other vessels predisposing to relapses and re-interventions (Conger et al., 2016). Furthermore, {{in the case of an}} acute iatrogenic arterial bleeding Squid was very useful in emergency to quickly and completely fill the ruptured artery that presented a large breach with significant extravasation of contrast. Squid alone was used in 4 cases of type II endoleak embolization: after the advancement of a coaxial microcatheter in the Riolano arch or in the ileo-lumbar artery and its placement in the endoleak sac, the progressive filling with Squid of the aneurysmatic sac was successfully performed and a permanent occlusion was obtained. In the past, type 2 endoleak embolization was performed using different embolic agents such as glue, coils, thrombin and Onyx, combined or alone (Abullarage et al., 2012; Ierardi et al., 2017; Khaja et al., 2014). The advantage of using an EVOH-based liquid embolic agent, as Onyx or Squid, is related to its capacity to fill completely the sac including inflow and outflow vessels, forming a more stable plug than that provided by coils (Ierardi et al., 2017). Another significant advantage of EVOH-based liquid embolic agents is their complete detachment from the microcatheter tip, not always verifiable after glue infusion. Usually in type 2 endoleak embolization, after the placement of a standard angiographic in the superior mesenteric (or hypogastric) artery, microcatheter is advanced for a long distance before reaching the endoleak sac. The risk of an accidental spread of embolizing material from the microcatheter tip after embolization during its long retraction for many tens of centimeters without the protection of the angiographic catheter is potentially higher using glue than Squid (or Onyx): an accidental embolization of branches of inferior mesenteric or ileo-lumbar arteries with consequent ischemia is possible and it was previously described using glue (Bailey et al., 2011). Considering the clinical outcome of the whole population, our findings were globally satisfactory in terms of technical success, clinical success, re-intervention and recorded complications. In our heterogeneous group of patients, the largest subgroup of patients (n[*]=[*] 10) was that submitted to right PVE, extended to IV and I segments in selected cases, to reduce the risk of postoperative liver failure after right hepatectomy (Loffroy et al., 2015). In the past, different embolic agents were used for PVE, even though cyanoacrylate glue is usually considered the ideal embolic agent with the highest expected rate of liver regeneration (Jaberi et al., 2016). Onyx was previously used in PVE either in humans (Né et al., 2018) or in experimental models (Smits et al., 2012). In our series, Squid and PVA particles (coils in some cases) were used as embolic agents in PVE obtaining good outcomes in terms of technical success (100 %), clinical success (80 %), and also future liver remnant volume increase (more than 50 %). In only two patients future liver remnant volume increase was not sufficient to perform right hepatectomy. 99 mTc-mebrofenin hepatobiliary scintigraphy (HBS) associated to CT volumetry was useful to completely evaluate the function of the future liver remnant before surgery: in previous studies (de Graaf et al., 2010), it was particularly helpful in case of compromised liver (previous chemotherapy, cirrhosis). Summarizing in PVE, further studies with a larger cohort of patients and randomized trials will be necessary to establish if Squid and glue could be comparable in terms of liver regeneration induction.|$|E
5000|$|The {{anterior}} set comprises (a) two {{or three}} small nodes behind {{the base of the}} xiphoid process, which receive afferents from the convex surface of the liver, and (b) one or two nodes on either side near the junction of the seventh rib with its cartilage, which receive lymphatic vessels from the front part of the diaphragm.

40|$|The Circle of Willis (CoW) is a ring-like {{structure}} {{of blood vessels}} found beneath the hypothalamus {{at the base of}} the brain, which distributes blood to the cerebral mass. Simple models of cerebral blood flow dynamics would create a tool capable of diagnosing potential outcomes of surgical or other therapies. A one-dimensional flow model is developed to capture the auto-regulation dynamics by which cerebral blood perfusion is maintained. Figure 1 shows a CoW schematic composed of circulus, afferent (inflow) and efferent (outflow) arteries. Positive flow around the CoW is clockwise but not restricted in direction, while flow in afferent and <b>efferent</b> <b>vessels</b> is restricted to the directions shown. Flow in <b>efferent</b> <b>vessels</b> is regulated by time varying peripheral resistances modelling the effects of auto-regulation in the smaller blood vessels they supply. While many individuals have complete and symmetrical CoW geometry, it is not uncommon for some elements to be restricted or omitted (van der Zwan and Hillen 1991) with the communicating vessels having a higher occurrence of omission (Alpers and Berry 1963) ...|$|R
