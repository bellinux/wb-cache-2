40|$|In {{order to}} {{construct}} low-risk, software-intensive safety-critical systems, {{it is crucial to}} identify and prevent risks during the early stages of software development, since most safety-critical decisions are made at that time. Even if limited information is available about the system under development, a detailed safety analysis should be applied, for example to derive safety-oriented requirements for safety-critical systems. Certain faults of software-controlled systems that are caused, e. g., by missing requirements can lead to fatal consequences such as death, environmental pollution, etc. However, traditional requirements engineering techniques do not focus on identifying hazards and their associated risks, but rather on identifying functional requirements consistently and completely, and safety analysis techniques are generally applied unsystematically when deriving safety requirements, without consideration of the completeness of the functional requirements. Only few approaches have been proposed to identify the functional requirements (expected behavior) and the safety requirements (non-expected behavior) concurrently. But even the most closely related methods do not identify these requirements in a complete, systematic, intuitive, and effective way. Therefore, an approach for effectively and completely identifying both <b>functional</b> requirements and <b>safety</b> requirements is desired. To resolve these open issues, SafeRE is proposed in this thesis. SafeRE (Safety-oriented Requirements Engineering) is a novel method for concurrently and completely determining <b>functional</b> requirements and <b>safety</b> requirements. It defines a general structure and a grammar for accommodating both <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> requirements and proposes a systematic safety analysis based on the identified type-based functional requirements for deriving safety requirements. The combined safety-oriented requirements are then generated in a finite state machine and presented in an HTML-based specification. For obtaining the complete set of <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> requirements, a sequence-based specification methodology and its corresponding tool are extended. The extended tool is named SafeSBS. This approach was validated in one industrial case study and one research case study. The results of these case studies show that SafeRE is effective for identifying the safety-oriented requirements completely both in theory and in practice...|$|R

40|$|Dynamic {{adaptation}} {{means that}} components are reconfigured at run time. Consequently, {{the degree to}} which a system fulfils its <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> requirements depends on the current system configuration at run time. The probability of a violation of functional requirements in combination with an importance factor for each requirement gives us a measure for reliability. In the same way, the degree of violation of safety requirements can be a measure for safety. These measures can easily be derived based on the probabilities of possible system configurations. For this purpose, we are introducing a new probabilistic analysis technique that determines configuration probabilities based on Fault trees, Binary Decision Diagrams (BDDs) and Markov chains. Through our recent work we have been able to determine configuration probabilities of systems but we neglected timing aspects [1]. Timing delays have impact on the adaptation behavior and are necessary to handle cyclic dependences. The contribution of the present article is to extend analysis towards models with timing delays. This technique builds upon the Methodologies and Architectures for Runtime Adaptive Systems (MARS) [2], a modeling concept we use for specifying the adaptation behavior of a system at design time. The results of this paper determine configuration probabilities, that are necessary to quantify the fulfillment of <b>functional</b> and <b>safety</b> requirements by adaptive systems...|$|R
