25|$|If {{a person}} has wrongfully damaged to the body, health, reputation, liberty, credit, privacy or {{chastity}} of another, or to another's personality in a severe way, the injured person may claim a reasonable compensation in money even if such injury is not a purely pecuniary loss. If it was reputation that has been damaged, the injured person may also claim the taking of proper measures for the rehabilitation of his reputation. A person who, intentionally or negligently, has wrongfully damaged the rights of another is bound to compensate him for any injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied when the injury is done intentionally in a manner against the rules of morals. A person, who violates a statutory provision enacted {{for the protection of}} others and therefore prejudice to others, is bound to compensate for the injury, except no negligence in his act can be proved. If several persons have wrongfully damaged the rights of another jointly, they are <b>jointly</b> <b>liable</b> for the injury arising therefrom. The same rule shall be applied even if which one has actually caused the injury cannot be sure. Instigators and accomplices are deemed to be joint tortfeasors.|$|E
2500|$|One case {{is headed}} {{by a team of}} 14 {{attorneys}} of Dutch law firm , which is representing 11 plaintiffs including the foundation [...] "Mothers of the Enclaves of Srebrenica and Žepa" [...] (which represents 6,000 relatives of the victims), who asked the court, inter alia, to grant a judicial declaration that the UN and the State of the Netherlands breached their obligation to prevent genocide, as laid down in Genocide Convention and to hold them <b>jointly</b> <b>liable</b> to pay compensation for the loss and injury suffered by plaintiffs as well as damages yet to be determined by the court, and to settle these according to law. On 10 July 2008, the court ruled that it had no jurisdiction against the UN, however the proceedings against the State of the Netherlands continued. Plaintiffs have appealed the judgment (in relation to UN immunity), and first public hearings relating to this issue were held on 28 January 2010. The decision by the Court was made on 30 March 2010, by which the UN's absolute immunity was upheld. Plaintiffs have appealed this judgment as well, but the Supreme court of the Netherlands held in April 2012 that the UN enjoyed the immunity. On 11 June 2013 the European Court of Human Rights unanimously declared the application inadmissible, in relation to the alleged violation of Article 6 of the European Convention of Human Rights because of the granting of absolute immunity to the UN by the Dutch Supreme Court. On 16 July 2014 the District Court in The Hague ruled that the Netherlands is liable for the deaths of some 300 victims who were under Dutchbat's effective control, and which were forced out of the Dutchbat compound in Potočari, but not for the deaths of other victims. On 27 June 2017 the Hague Court of Appeals upheld the first-instance judgment against the Netherlands, but limited the Dutch government’s liability to 30 percent of the damages.|$|E
