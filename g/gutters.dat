5|$|The {{exterior}} of the observatory building has a brick cornice, with stone sills and lintels, stone water course, ornamental <b>gutters,</b> and original copper downspouts. Most of the building's windows are of the wooden double-hung variety and original, as are the front entrance door transom and concrete stoop. The original front balustrade has been replaced, however, the western stoop and ornamental iron balustrade is still original.|$|E

50|$|A box <b>gutter,</b> {{parallel}} <b>gutter,</b> or trough <b>gutter</b> is a rain <b>gutter</b> on a roof usually rectangular in shape; {{it may be}} {{lined with}} EPDM rubber, metal, asphalt, or roofing felt, and may be concealed behind a parapet or the eaves, or in a roof valley.|$|R
5|$|Copper {{has been}} used since ancient times as a durable, {{corrosion}} resistant, and weatherproof architectural material. Roofs, flashings, rain <b>gutters,</b> downspouts, domes, spires, vaults, and doors have been made from copper for {{hundreds or thousands of}} years. Copper's architectural use has been expanded in modern times to include interior and exterior wall cladding, building expansion joints, radio frequency shielding, and antimicrobial and decorative indoor products such as attractive handrails, bathroom fixtures, and counter tops. Some of copper's other important benefits as an architectural material include low thermal movement, light weight, lightning protection, and recyclability.|$|E
5|$|Lead {{has many}} uses in the {{construction}} industry; lead sheets are used as architectural metals in roofing material, cladding, flashing, <b>gutters</b> and gutter joints, and on roof parapets. Detailed lead moldings are used as decorative motifs to fix lead sheet. Lead is still used in statues and sculptures, including for armatures. In the past it was often used to balance the wheels of cars; for environmental reasons this use is being phased {{out in favor of}} other materials.|$|E
5|$|The {{rainwater}} which {{falls on}} Poh Ern Shih is collected from surface run-offs and rain <b>gutters</b> {{and used to}} irrigate the temple grounds, {{as well as to}} generate electricity used for charging the batteries of in-house motorised wheelchairs. The electricity is produced by water from the highest floor of the temple passing through hydroelectric-generators. A purification system is also being installed, so that the collected rainwater can be filtered and made potable.|$|E

40|$|A <b>gutter</b> {{design that}} optimises self {{flushing}} potential {{is crucial in}} rain water harvesting at the dwelling scale. Excluding and removing organic debris from a <b>gutter</b> {{is essential for the}} maintenance of water quality in water harvesting systems. There are existing debris exclusion products; however the function, performance and suitability of these products is not well understood and application is limited as they require ongoing maintenance. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the water harvesting <b>gutter</b> configuration that minimises the maintenance needs and optimises self flushing. Investigation into the conditions and processes that influence the performance of guarded and un-guarded roofs found that the failure mechanisms of <b>gutter</b> guard products was due to the entrapment of debris (above the guard) and infiltration of decomposed debris. A series of experiments was undertaken to test a set of three hypotheses, regarding the most efficient shape and slope and obstruction threshold. The results support the notion that the semi-circular <b>gutter</b> is the most efficient cross sectional shape for a <b>gutter.</b> Increasing the slope of a <b>gutter</b> increased the bed-load (sediment) transport facility of a <b>gutter,</b> but had a negative effect on the removal of buoyant debris from the <b>gutter.</b> The combination of <b>gutter</b> guard products with accessibility to the 'head' of the <b>gutter</b> and the semi-circular high slope design conditions is likely to provide an effective self flushing and low maintenance <b>gutter...</b>|$|R
50|$|A <b>gutter</b> punk is a {{homeless}} or transient individual, often through means of freighthopping or hitchhiking. <b>Gutter</b> punks are often juveniles {{who are in}} some way associated with the anarcho-punk subculture.

5|$|At an {{altitude}} of , Chard {{is one of the}} highest towns in Somerset, and is also the southernmost. The suburbs include: Crimchard, Furnham, Glynswood, Henson Park and Old Town. Local folklore claims that the town has a very unusual and unique feature, a stream running along either side of Fore Street. One stream eventually flows into the Bristol Channel and the other reaches the English Channel. This situation changed when the tributary of the Axe was diverted into the Isle; the gutter in Holyrood Street, though, still flows into the River Axe and therefore it is still true it lies on the watershed and that two <b>gutters</b> within the down eventually drain into the Bristol Channel and the English Channel.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the War of the First Coalition Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. With {{military}} rations unable to satisfy his large appetite, he would eat any available food from <b>gutters</b> and refuse heaps but his condition still deteriorated through hunger. Suffering from exhaustion, he was hospitalised and became the subject of a series of medical experiments to test his eating capacity, in which, among other things, he ate a meal intended for 15 people in a single sitting, ate live cats, snakes, lizards and puppies, and swallowed an eel whole without chewing. Despite his unusual diet, he was of normal size and appearance, and showed no signs of mental illness other than what was described as an apathetic temperament.|$|E
5|$|Chastened by this experience, {{he agreed}} to submit to any {{procedure}} that would cure his appetite, and was treated with laudanum, tobacco pills, wine vinegar and soft-boiled eggs. The procedures failed, and doctors could not keep him on a controlled diet; he would sneak {{out of the hospital}} to scavenge for offal in <b>gutters,</b> rubbish heaps and outside butchers' shops, and attempted to drink the blood of other patients in the hospital and to eat the corpses in the hospital morgue. After being suspected of eating a toddler he was ejected from the hospital. He reappeared four years later in Versailles suffering from severe tuberculosis, and died shortly afterwards, following a lengthy bout of exudative diarrhoea.|$|E
50|$|A rain <b>gutter</b> (also {{known as}} eavestrough (especially in Canada), eaves channel <b>guttering</b> or {{simply as a}} <b>gutter)</b> is a narrow channel, or trough, forming the {{component}} of a roof system which collects and diverts rainwater from the roof.|$|R

5|$|In general, humans {{consider}} woodpeckers in a favourable light; {{they are}} viewed as interesting birds and fascinating to watch as they drum or forage. However, their activities are not universally appreciated. Some individual birds habitually excavate holes in buildings, fencing and utility poles, and there are various reverberatory structures on buildings such as <b>gutters,</b> downspouts, chimneys, vents and aluminium sheeting, that the birds find attractive for drumming. Houses with shingles or wooden boarding are also attractive as possible nesting or roosting sites, especially when close to large trees or woodland. Several exploratory holes may be made, especially at the junctions of vertical boards or {{at the corners of}} tongue-and-groove boarding. The birds may also drill holes in houses as they forage for insect larvae and pupae hidden behind the woodwork.|$|E
5|$|On April 4, Lin passed {{directly}} over Tonga with winds up to 110km/h (70mph) and heavy rains. Initial reports of damage stated that only vegetation had been impacted. However, later reports stated that power lines had been knocked down by high winds {{and the heavy}} rains triggered minor flooding in Nuku'alofa. Some houses lost their rain <b>gutters</b> from the storm. Due to strong winds, officials were forced to shut down power stations in Tongatapu to protect the system. Most of the power lines in Tonga were either downed or damaged by the storm and numerous trees fell across the island. Several roads were also blocked by downed trees and billboards were broken. No one was injured by the storm but {{there were reports of}} significant crop losses.|$|E
5|$|A royal hunting park {{close to}} Melbourne was {{probably}} created by King John around 1200, and the King {{is known to}} have stayed at the manor house on at least five occasions. John gave the manor and its lands to Hugh Beauchamp, although they appear to have soon reverted to the crown, being gifted by Henry III to Bishop Walter Mauclerk of Carlisle in about 1230. The estate returned to the crown on the bishop's death in 1248, and Henry granted the land to his son, Edmund Crouchback, 1st Earl of Lancaster, in 1265. At some later date, the manor appears to have been granted to a Philip Marc, before passing to Thomas, 2nd Earl of Lancaster, the King's son. This was in 1298 when he came of age, his father having died two years earlier. Early references to the house itself are rare, but there are records of repairs to the <b>gutters</b> in 1246 and to the roof of the King's Chamber in 1248.|$|E

5000|$|There are {{a number}} of types of curb, {{categorized}} by shape, material, height, and whether the curb is combined with a <b>gutter.</b> Most curb is constructed separately from the pavement, and the <b>gutter</b> is formed at the joint between the roadway and the curb. Combined curb and <b>gutter</b> (also called [...] "curb and channel") has a concrete curb and <b>gutter</b> cast together in one piece. [...] "Integral curb" [...] is curbing constructed integrally {{as a part of a}} concrete pavement.|$|R

5|$|Cultural {{attitudes towards}} rain differ across the world. In {{temperate}} climates, {{people tend to}} be more stressed when the weather is unstable or cloudy, with its impact greater on men than women. Rain can also bring joy, as some consider it to be soothing or enjoy the aesthetic appeal of it. In dry places, such as India, or during periods of drought, rain lifts people's moods. In Botswana, the Setswana word for rain, pula, is used as the name of the national currency, in recognition of the economic importance of rain in its country, since it has a desert climate. Several cultures have developed means of dealing with rain and have developed numerous protection devices such as umbrellas and raincoats, and diversion devices such as <b>gutters</b> and storm drains that lead rains to sewers. Many people find the scent during and immediately after rain pleasant or distinctive. The source of this scent is petrichor, an oil produced by plants, then absorbed by rocks and soil, and later released into the air during rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the roll, the length of the roll, the length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as <b>gutters</b> and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|Following this incident, Tarrare {{was desperate}} to avoid further {{military}} service, {{and returned to the}} hospital, telling Percy that he would attempt any possible cure for his appetite. Percy treated him with laudanum without success; further treatments with wine vinegar and tobacco pills were likewise unsuccessful. Following these failures, Percy fed Tarrare large quantities of soft-boiled eggs, but this also failed to suppress his appetite. Efforts to keep him on any kind of controlled diet failed; he would sneak out of the hospital to scavenge for offal outside butchers' shops and to fight stray dogs for carrion in <b>gutters,</b> alleys and rubbish heaps. He was also caught several times within the hospital drinking from patients undergoing bloodletting, and attempting to eat the bodies in the hospital mortuary. Other doctors believed that Tarrare was mentally ill and pressed for him to be transferred to a lunatic asylum, but Percy was keen to continue his experiments and Tarrare remained in the military hospital.|$|E
50|$|A street <b>gutter</b> is a {{depression}} running parallel to a road designed to collect rainwater flowing {{along the street}} and divert it into a storm drain. A <b>gutter</b> alleviates water buildup on a street, allowing pedestrians to pass without walking through puddles and {{reducing the risk of}} hydroplaning by road vehicles. When a curbstone is present, a <b>gutter</b> may be formed by the convergence of the road surface and the vertical face of the sidewalk; otherwise, a dedicated <b>gutter</b> surface made of concrete may be present.|$|R

5|$|Nearly 300 {{households}} {{were members}} by 2006, {{and in the}} same year, the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation awarded the synagogue a grant of $350,000 for exterior restoration of the sanctuary. The grant was part of a million-dollar capital campaign that the membership intended to carry out in 2008, as the synagogue building still required extensive repairs: the roof leaked, causing interior damage, and (along with the <b>gutters)</b> needed to be replaced; interior columns were taped to prevent plaster from falling off them; the sanctuary doors needed to be replaced; and the stained glass windows needed to be removed, the metal holding them repaired, and their wooden framing replaced. In 2007 the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites Program awarded Baith Israel Anshei Emes grants totaling $17,500, for copper roof and masonry restoration.|$|E
5|$|On the {{outbreak}} of the War of the First Coalition, Tarrare joined the French Revolutionary Army. Unfortunately for him, military rations were insufficient to satisfy his appetite. He would carry out tasks for other soldiers in return for a share of their rations and scavenge on the dungheap for scraps, but this was not enough to satisfy him. Suffering from extreme exhaustion, he was admitted to the military hospital at Soultz-Haut-Rhin. He was granted quadruple rations but remained hungry; he would scavenge for garbage in <b>gutters</b> and refuse containers, eat the scraps of food left by other patients, and creep into the apothecary's room to eat the poultices. Military surgeons could not understand his appetite; Tarrare was ordered to remain in the military hospital to take part in physiological experiments designed by Dr.Courville (surgeon to the 9th Hussar Regiment) and George Didier, Baron Percy, surgeon-in-chief of the hospital.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} {{commonly}} caught throughout its habitat, with sand flats, tidal <b>gutters</b> in estuaries and surf beaches commonly having producing good catches. Excessively shallow water, especially in proximity to Zostera beds may produce numerous undersized fish, {{and may be}} avoided if the young fish are too prevalent. Due to their preferred habitat, light lines with minimal weight added are employed to avoid spooking the fish, with a small running bean or ball sinker commonly rigged above a size 4 or 6 hook. Specialist whiting fishermen often use a red piece of tubing or beads to attract the whiting; whether this works {{has yet to be}} proved, but anecdotal evidence shows the fishermen's catches don't suffer. Baits used resemble the species natural prey, with prawns, nippers, a variety of bivalves and beach worms most often used, with more successful catches obtained using live bait.|$|E
