These are inspections, adjustments, cleaning, or replacements that should be done regularly to ensure proper functioning of all the systems in a house, and to avoid costly emergencies. Examples include annual testing and adjustment of alarm systems, central heating or cooling systems (electrodes, thermocouples, and fuel filters), replacement of water treatment components or air-handling filters, purging of heating radiators and water tanks, defrosting a freezer, vacuum refrigerator coils, refilling dry floor-drain traps with water, cleaning out rain gutters, <b>down</b> <b>spouts</b> and drains, touching up worn house paint and weather seals, and cleaning accumulated creosote out of chimney flues, which may be best left to a chimney sweep.|$|R
50|$|Plottel {{enjoyed a}} very diverse {{architectural}} practice with {{commercial and residential}} commissions in an eclectic modern style drawing on the American Romanesque and Arts and Craft movement. Among his early commissions were Embank House at 325 Collins St in 1911, the Williamstown Municipal Buildings in 1914 and several flat projects such as ‘Chilterns’, Glenferrie Road, 1917 ‘Garden Court’ of 1918 in Marne St South Yarra and ‘Waverly’ at 115-119 Grey Street St. Kilda from 1920. These designs tended to fine detailing in brick, but in a restrained manner characteristic of the romantic movement of the Arts Crafts. The prominent use of rain heads and <b>down</b> <b>spouts</b> in the composition is an interesting pointer to Plottel’s later work.|$|R

It likewise assessed the system’s technical soundness, environmental dimensions, economic feasibility {{as well as its}} social and political acceptability. Technically, the rainwater harvesting system consisting of rooftops, gutters, <b>down</b> <b>spouts,</b> filter and storage tank is capable of collecting/impounding rainwater to supply and support the drinking water needs of 8 - 12 members of the family throughout the six-month dry period (January-June) of the year. In terms of rainwater microbiological quality, total coliforms and Escherichia coli were of low concentrations (i,e., less than 1. 1 MPN/ 100 ml) meeting the allowable limits set by the Philippine National Standards for Drinking Water (PNSDW). Other quality and aesthetic characteristics of collected/stored rainwater such as the presence of inorganic and organic substances through total dissolved solids as well as its total hardness adequately met the PNSDW values indicating potability of the harvested rainwater. The harvester is economically feasible especially so if construction materials would be limited to locally available ones. Economic analysis showed that the cost of the rainwater harvestin...|$|R

40|$|As the {{infrastructure}} in the United States ages, increasing importance is {{being placed on}} rehabilitating the nation’s wastewater treatment collection systems. Cracks, settling, tree root intrusion, and other disturbances that develop over time deteriorate pipe lines and other conveyance structures that comprise wastewater collection systems. These deteriorating conditions can {{increase the amount of}} inflow and infiltration (I/I) entering the system, especially during periods of wet weather. Increased I/I levels create an additional hydraulic load on the system and thereby decrease its overall capacity. In addition to I/I flow, storm water may enter the wastewater collection system through illegal connections such as <b>down</b> <b>spouts</b> and sump pumps. If the combination of wastewater, infiltration, and illegal storm water connections entering the wastewater treatment plant exceeds the capacity of the system at any point, untreated wastewater may be released into the receiving water. This bypass of untreated wastewater, known as a Sanitary Sewer Overflow (SSO), may adversely affect human health as well as impair the usage and degrade the water quality of the receiving water. Under the traditional method of sewer relief, a replacement or additional parallel sewer line is constructed by digging along {{the entire length of the}} existing pipeline. While these traditional methods of sewer rehabilitation require unearthing and replacing the deficient pipe (the dig-and-replace method), trenchless methods of rehabilitation use the existing pipe as a host for a new pipe or liner. Trenchless sewer rehabilitation techniques offer a method of correcting pipe deficiencies that requires less restoration and causes less disturbance and environmental degradation than the traditional digand-replace method. Trenchless sewer rehabilitation methods include...|$|R

5000|$|The {{complete}} distilling apparatus {{consists of}} three parts: the [...] "cucurbit" [...] (Arabic ḳarʿa, Greek βίκος, bikos), the still pot containing the liquid to be distilled, which is heated by a flame; the [...] "head" [...] or [...] "cap" [...] (Arabic anbiḳ, Greek ἄμβιξ, ambix) which fits over {{the mouth of the}} cucurbit to receive the vapors, with an attached downward-sloping [...] "tube" [...] (Greek σωλήν, soleen), leading to the [...] "receiver" [...] (Arabic ḳābila, Greek ἄγγος, aggos, or φιάλη, phialee) container. In the case of another distilling vessel, the retort, the [...] "cap" [...] and the [...] "cucurbit" [...] have been combined to form a single vessel. The anbik is also called the raʾs (head) of the cucurbit. The liquid in the cucurbit is heated or boiled; the vapour rises into the anbik, where it cools by contact with the walls and condenses, running <b>down</b> the <b>spout</b> into the receiver.

40|$|Groundwater {{monitoring}} has detected tritium ({sup 3 }H) and {sup 22 }Na contamination down gradient {{from the}} Brookhaven LINAC Isotope Producer (BLIP), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Site characterization {{studies indicate that}} the BLIP {{is the source of}} contamination. The highest measured values for {sup 3 }H were 52, 400 pCi/L recorded less than 100 feet south (down gradient) of the BLIP facility. The BLIP produces radioisotopes that are crucial in nuclear medicine for both research and clinical use. The BLIP also supports research on diagnostic and therapeutic radiopharmaceuticals. During operation a proton beam impinges a target (typically salts encapsulated in stainless steel) to produce the required radioisotopes. The proton beam is completely absorbed prior to reaching the soils surrounding the target shaft. However, secondary neutrons are produced that reach the soil causing activation products to form. Among the longer-lived isotopes of concern are tritium and {sup 22 }Na. Both of these isotopes have the potential to negatively impact the groundwater below the BLIP. Several corrective actions have been implemented at the BLIP facility in response to tritium detection in the groundwater. The first actions were to improve surface water management (e. g. storm water <b>down</b> <b>spouts)</b> and the installation of a gunite cap around the BLIP facility. These measures are designed to minimize water flow through the activated soils in the vicinity of BLIP. In conjunction with these improvements, BNL is installing a close-proximity subsurface barrier in the activated soils beneath the BLIP facility. The barrier will prevent water migration through the activated soil zone as well as prevent activation product migration out of the zone. To minimize impacts on the operation of the BLIP requires in-situ barrier installation using low energy techniques that will not disturb the alignment of the BLIP or nearby accelerator beams. BNL chose an innovative barrier technology termed Viscous Liquid Barrier (VLB). This technology was developed at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory with funding from the US Department of Energy (EM- 50). It uses low-pressure permeation grouting to deliver a colloidal-silica grout to the subsurface. The grout gels in place forming a barrier to liquid movement. MSE Technologies Applications (MSE-TA) has been tasked with designing, installing and verifying the barrier. This paper will discuss the problem faced at BLIP and detail the design and proposed installation of the VLB at the site...|$|R

"But, Linda--" [...] {{and then}} he went on to show to her how very {{unsatisfactory}} a courtship theirs would be, if, now that they were together, nothing could be arranged as to their future meeting. It soon became clear to Linda that Ludovic knew everything that {{was going on in the}} house, and had learned it all from Tetchen. Tetchen at this moment was quite aware of his presence up-stairs, and was prepared to cough aloud, standing at the kitchen door, if any sign were made that either Steinmarc or Madame Staubach were about to leave the parlour. Though it had seemed to Linda that her lover had come to her through the darkness, aided by the powers thereof, the assistance which had really brought him there was simply that of the old cook down-stairs. It certainly was on the cards that Tetchen might help him again after the same fashion, but Ludovic felt that such help would be but of little avail unless Linda, now that she had acknowledged her love, would do something to help also. With Ludovic Valcarm it was quite a proper course of things that he should jump out of a boat, or disappear into the roof among the rafters, or escape across the tiles and <b>down</b> the <b>spouts</b> in the darkness, as preliminary steps in a love affair. But in this special love affair such movements could only be preliminary; and therefore, as he was now standing face to face with Linda, and as there certainly had been difficulties in achieving this position, he was anxious to make some positive use of it. And then, as he explained to Linda in very few words, he was about to leave Nuremberg, and go to Munich. She did not quite understand whether he was always to remain in Munich; nor did she think of inquiring how he was to earn his bread there. But it was his scheme, that she should go with him and that there they should be married. If she would meet him at the railway station in time for the early train, they certainly could reach Munich without impediment. Linda would find no difficulty in leaving the house. Tetchen would take care that even the door should be open for her.|$|R

I have often observed that this corner is a haunt and loitering-place for those winds which have no work to do upon the deep, dashing ships against our iron-bound shores; nor in the forest, tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their vast roots. Here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief. See, at this moment, how they assail yonder poor woman, who is passing just within the verge of the lamplight! One blast struggles for her umbrella, and turns it wrong side outward; another whisks the cape of her cloak across her eyes; while a third takes most unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire.

5000|$|The {{species has}} been used in antiquity for the {{production}} of potash, hence: its Arabic name, ušnān. The 10th-century Arab physician, al-Tamimi, described the plant in his day as being imported into Palestine, Egypt and other countries from the riverine gulches around the vicinity of Amman, in Transjordan, and used in the production of an alkali soap (Arabic: غاسول = ġāsūl) and of cleaning agents. According to al-Tamimi, the plants were gathered in their fresh, green-state in large bundles, transferred to furnaces made with plastered floors and stone spouts, where they were cast inside, beneath which were laid large timbers that were set aflame, causing the melting alkali-substance to drip <b>down</b> by the <b>spouts</b> into a threshing-floor directly below. The liquid would there be collected and eventually become hardened when it cooled-off, the finished product resembling a hard black-colored stone. The stone-like mineral could be broken-up into smaller fragments and used as a laundry detergent. Some of the salt bushes produced a type of potassium alum (Arabic: shab) that was brownish in color, having a strong alkalinity and burning effect when tasted. Al-Tamimi adds that one of the chemical elements had by burning Seidlitzia's succulent green leaves is al-qalī, which, besides being a natural cleansing agent, its [...] "plant ashes" [...] (potash) could be converted into potassium by placing the ashes into a pot, adding water thereto, and heating it until one is left with an evaporated solution. When this solution was mixed with coarsely ground yellow-orpiment (...) and with oil extracted from unripe olives, heated in a ceramic skillet placed over a fire, and turned constantly with an iron spoon until it congeals (having the fire actually touch it until it turns reddish in color), it too, according to al-Tamimi, is said to have certain medicinal properties, said to prevent tooth decay, as well as in assuaging blood loss from the gums. It is also said to be useful in removing halitosis. When the substance congeals, stirring ceases, and the substance is then allowed to burn completely while remaining in the ceramic skillet. It is then taken-up while still hot and is pounded by mortar and pestle, until one is left with a fine powder. It is then sifted in a sieve and stored until ready for use. A quantity of one dirham-weight (ca. 3.31 g during Ottoman times) was traditionally applied with one's finger to the effected part of the gums in the mouth, and allowed to remain there for one hour. Its application, however, {{is said to have been}} quite unpleasant because of its severe burning effect and strong alkalinity. After which, the mouth was rinsed with cold water, followed by gargling with Persian rose oil to aid in the mouth's cooling.|$|R
60|$|When Spirit of Vitriol poured upon common Salt or Salt-petre {{makes an}} Ebullition with the Salt, and unites with it, and in Distillation the Spirit {{of the common}} Salt or Salt-petre comes over much easier than it would do before, and the acid part of the Spirit of Vitriol stays behind; does not this argue that the fix'd Alcaly of the Salt attracts the acid Spirit of the Vitriol more {{strongly}} than its own Spirit, {{and not being able}} to hold them both, lets go its own? And when Oil of Vitriol is drawn off from its weight of Nitre, and from both the Ingredients a compound Spirit of Nitre is distilled, and two parts of this Spirit are poured on one part of Oil of Cloves or Carraway Seeds, or of any ponderous Oil of vegetable or animal Substances, or Oil of Turpentine thicken'd with a little Balsam of Sulphur, and the Liquors grow so very hot in mixing, as presently to send up a burning Flame; does not this very great and sudden Heat argue that the two Liquors mix with violence, and that their Parts in mixing run towards one another with an accelerated Motion, and clash with the greatest Force? And is it not for the same reason that well rectified Spirit of Wine poured on the same compound Spirit flashes; and that the Pulvis fulminans, composed of Sulphur, Nitre, and Salt of Tartar, goes off with a more sudden and violent Explosion than Gun-powder, the acid Spirits of the Sulphur and Nitre rushing towards one another, and towards the Salt of Tartar, with so great a violence, as by the shock to turn the whole at once into Vapour and Flame? Where the Dissolution is slow, it makes a slow Ebullition and a gentle Heat; and where it is quicker, it makes a greater Ebullition with more heat; and where it is done at once, the Ebullition is contracted into a sudden Blast or violent Explosion, with a heat equal to that of Fire and Flame. So when a Drachm of the above-mention'd compound Spirit of Nitre was poured upon half a Drachm of Oil of Carraway Seeds in vacuo, the Mixture immediately made a flash like Gun-powder, and burst the exhausted Receiver, which was a Glass six Inches wide, and eight Inches deep. And even the gross Body of Sulphur powder'd, and with an equal weight of Iron Filings and a little Water made into Paste, acts upon the Iron, and in five or six hours grows too hot to be touch'd, and emits a Flame. And by these Experiments compared with the great quantity of Sulphur with which the Earth abounds, and the warmth of the interior Parts of the Earth, and hot Springs, and burning Mountains, and with Damps, mineral Coruscations, Earthquakes, hot suffocating Exhalations, Hurricanes, and Spouts; we may learn that sulphureous Steams abound in the Bowels of the Earth and ferment with Minerals, and sometimes take fire with a sudden Coruscation and Explosion; and if pent up in subterraneous Caverns, burst the Caverns with a great shaking of the Earth, as in springing of a Mine. And then the Vapour generated by the Explosion, expiring through the Pores of the Earth, feels hot and suffocates, and makes Tempests and Hurricanes, and sometimes causes the Land to slide, or the Sea to boil, and carries up the Water thereof in Drops, which by their weight fall <b>down</b> again in <b>Spouts.</b> Also some sulphureous Steams, at all times when the Earth is dry, ascending into the Air, ferment there with nitrous Acids, and sometimes taking fire cause Lightning and Thunder, and fiery Meteors. For the Air abounds with acid Vapours fit to promote Fermentations, as appears by the rusting of Iron and Copper in it, the kindling of Fire by blowing, and the beating of the Heart by means of Respiration. Now the above-mention'd Motions are so great and violent as to shew that in Fermentations the Particles of Bodies which almost rest, are put into new Motions by a very potent Principle, which acts upon them only when they approach one another, and causes them to meet and clash with great violence, and grow hot with the motion, and dash one another into pieces, and vanish into Air, and Vapour, and Flame.|$|R
