50|$|The {{discount}} rate is the fee a <b>factoring</b> <b>company</b> charges {{to provide the}} factoring service. Since a formal factoring transaction involves the outright purchase of the invoice, the {{discount rate}} is typical stated {{as a percentage of}} the face value of the invoices. For instance, a <b>factoring</b> <b>company</b> may charge 5% for an invoice due in 45 days. In contrast, companies that do accounts receivable financing may charge per week or per month. Thus, an invoice financing company that charges 1% per week would result in a discount rate of 6-7% for the same invoice.|$|E

5000|$|There is much {{confusion}} with the terminology “discount rate” because {{the term is}} used in different ways.

[...] Discount rates from factoring companies to consumers can range anywhere between 8% up to over 18% but usually average somewhere in the middle. Factoring discount rates can be a bit higher when compared to home loan interest rates, due to the fact the factoring transactions are more of a boutique product for investors opposed to the mainstream collateralized mortgage transactions.|$|E
