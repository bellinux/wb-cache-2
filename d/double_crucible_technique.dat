The ceramic materials were characterized using x-ray diffraction, dielectric measurements, and hysteresis measurements. To stabilize the perovskite phase, the columbite route was utilized with a <b>double</b> <b>crucible</b> <b>technique</b> and excess PbO. The phase-pure perovskite phase of PNN–PZN–PZT ceramics was obtained over a wide compositional range. It was observed that for the ternary system 0. 5 PNN–(0. 5 - x) PZN–xPZT, the change in the transition temperature (Tm) is approximately linear with respect to the PZT content in the range x [H 11505] 0 to 0. 5. With an increase in x, Tm shifts up to high temperatures. Examination of the remanent polarization (Pr) revealed a significant increase with increasing x. In addition, the relative permittivity ([H 9280]r) increased as a function of x. The highest permittivities ([H 9280]r[H 11505] 22, 000) and the highest remanent polarization (Pr [H 11505] 25 μC/cm 2) were recorded for the binary composition 0. 5 Pb(Ni 1 / 3 Nb 2 / 3) O 3 – 0. 5 Pb(Zr 1 / 2 Ti 1 / 2) O 3...|$|E

This study reveals that the porous bio-char can be prepared by leaching ash from rice husk char at low temperature instead of high temperature application.

In this method, the bulk volume of air inside the bigger crucible is replaced by raw char, again when the crucible is heated up; firstly the volume of air inside the crucible is expanded and a portion of the air comes out from both the small and bigger crucible; secondly the volatile part of rice husk is reacted with oxygen and it is assumed that the entire amount of oxygen is exhausted from the crucible during the heating process.

The CTF is a method for incorporating glasses with vastly differing thermal properties into a single optical fiber. Each of these two classes of fiber brings a new set of optical characteristics into being. The RHOF exhibit many of the same guidance properties as the previously researched microstructure fibers, such as reduced mode counts in a large area core. CTF fibers show great promise for integrating core materials with extremely high levels of nonlinearity or gain.

Rice husk char contains high amount silica that retards the porousness of bio-char. Porousness of rice husk char could be enhanced by removing the silica from char and applying heat at high temperature. Furthermore, the char is activated by using chemical activation under high temperature. In this study no inert media is used. The study is conducted at low oxygen environment by applying biomass for consuming oxygen inside reactor and <b>double</b> <b>crucible</b> method (one crucible inside another) is applied to prevent intrusion of oxygen into the char. The study results shows that porous carbon is prepared successfully without using any inert media. The adsorption capacity of material increased due to removal of silica and due to the activation with zinc chloride compared to using raw rice husk char. The surface area of porous carbon and {{activated carbon}} {{are found to be}} 28, 331 and 645  m 2  g− 1 for raw rice husk char, silica removed rice husk char and zinc chloride activated rice husk char, respectively.
