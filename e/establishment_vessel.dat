2500|$|A {{mutation}} in the NDP gene causes Norrie disease. The official {{name of the}} gene is [...] "Norrie disease (pseudoglioma)", and its official symbol is NDP. The normal function of the NDP gene is to produce the instructions for creating a protein called norrin. For the normal development of the eye and other body systems, norrin {{is believed to be}} crucial. Norrin also appears to be crucial in the specialization of the cells of the retina and the establishment of a blood supply to the inner ear and the tissues of the retina. The role of norrin in the specialization of retinal cells for their unique sensory is interfered by the mutation of NDP. This results in an accumulation of immature retinal cells {{in the back of the}} eye.

40|$|Recently discovered, miRNAs have {{quickly become}} strong {{regulators}} of biological processes. These small non-coding RNAs of about 22 nucleotides partially base pair to the 3 ’UTR of the targeted mRNAs and repress them. Due to their wide range effects, microRNAs were extensively studied in various diseases and were rapidly demonstrated to be deregulated in pathologies such as cancer. More recently, {{they have been}} shown to be implicated in vascular network formation (angiogenesis) and were proposed to be used in anti-angiogenic therapies. Nowadays about twenty angiomiRs have been discovered including the endothelial specific miR- 126. As observed in several miRNA profiling of endothelial cells and confirmed in our laboratory in HUVECs (human umbilical veins endothelial cells), miR- 21 and miR- 125 b are highly expressed in this cell type suggesting that these miRNAs could play a role in vascular network formation. We then studied the implication of miR- 21 and miR- 125 b in in vitro as well as in vivo angiogenesis. One of the most studied miRNA in cancer progression is miR- 21 as it was shown to modify proliferating properties of numerous tumor cells. Our experiments revealed that miR- 21 overexpression and inhibition have no direct effect on endothelial cells proliferation rate. However, miR- 21 overexpression leads to the inhibition of HUVECs migration and tube formation as demonstrated in in vitro angiogenic assays. Moreover, opposite effects were observed upon miR- 21 inhibition. We also confirmed that RhoB, a small Rho-GTPase implicated in stress fibers formation, is involved in these phenomena as RhoB inhibition using siRNA mimics miR- 21 overexpression in endothelial cells. Moreover, miR- 21 modulation affects RhoB mRNA and protein expressions. We further demonstrated a direct interaction between miR- 21 and the RhoB 3 ’UTR confirming that miR- 21 modulates angiogenesis partially through its effect on RhoB expression. A similar approach was used to study the implication of miR- 125 b in vascular network formation. In vivo, miR- 125 b expression was modulated in the zebrafish revealing that miR- 125 b expression needs to be controlled for proper intersomitic blood <b>vessels</b> <b>establishment.</b> In vitro, miR- 125 b overexpression decreases HUVECs migration and tube formation whereas miR- 125 b inhibition increases these functions. A transcriptomic analysis suggests that numerous adhesion molecules such as VE-cadherin or MCAM are involved in these processes. Furthermore, other proteins known to regulate angiogenesis such as the transcription factor ETS 1 and the VEGFA receptor, VEGFR 2 were also shown to be regulated by miR- 125 b. This observation confirms that miR- 125 b modulates angiogenic properties of endothelial cells. Finally, we investigated the impact of miR- 21 and miR- 125 b overexpression in an in vivo pathological model of angiogenesis. In a mouse model of choroïdal neovascularization we demonstrated that miR- 21 or miR- 125 b overexpression in the eyes of these mice decreases blood <b>vessel</b> <b>establishment</b> suggesting that these microRNAs could be used as therapeutic antiangiogenic agents. Taken together, the results presented in this thesis show that miR- 21 and miR- 125 b regulate angiogenesis in vitro and in vivo...|$|R
40|$|Matrix metalloproteinases (MMP) are {{a family}} of {{structurally}} related proteinases most widely recognized {{for their ability to}} degrade extracellular matrix, although recent investigations have demonstrated other biologic functions for these enzymes. MMP are typically not constitutively expressed, but are regulated by: (1) cytokines, growth factors, and cell–cell and cell–matrix interactions that control gene expression; (2) activation of their proenzyme form; and (3) the presence of MMP inhibitors [tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases, (TIMP) ]. MMP have important roles in normal processes including development, wound healing, mammary gland, and uterine involution, but are also involved in angiogenesis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Angiogenesis, characteristically defined as the <b>establishment</b> of new <b>vessels</b> from pre-existing vasculature, is required for biologic processes such as wound healing and pathologic processes such as arthritis, tumor growth, and metastasis. Blocking of MMP activity has been studied for potential therapeutic efficacy in controlling such pathologic processes. Synthetic MMP inhibitors, most notably the hydroxymates, have been engineered for this purpose and are presently in clinical trial. These inhibitors may have broad versus specific MMP inhibitory activity. As increased nonmatrix degrading capabilities of MMP are recognized, however, i. e., cytokine activation, processing of proteins to molecules of distinct biologic function, it becomes less clear whether the nonselective inhibition of MMP activity for all pathologic processes involving MMP is appropriate. This review focuses upon the contribution of MMP to the process of tumor invasion and angiogenesis, and discusses the design and use of MMP inhibitors as therapeutic agents in these processes...|$|R
40|$|Heterotopic {{ossification}} (HO), or endochondral {{bone formation}} at nonskeletal sites, often results from traumatic injury {{and can lead}} to devastating consequences. Alternatively, the ability to harness this phenomenon would greatly enhance current orthopedic tools for treating segmental bone defects. Thus, understanding the earliest events in this process potentially would allow us to design more targeted therapies to either block or enhance this process. Using a murine model of HO induced by delivery of adenovirus-transduced cells expressing bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2), we show here that one of the earliest stages in this process is the <b>establishment</b> of new <b>vessels</b> prior to the appearance of cartilage. As early as 48 hours after induction of HO, we observed the appearance of brown adipocytes expressing vascular endothelial growth factors (VEGFs) simultaneous with endothelial progenitor replication. This was determined by using a murine model that possesses the VEGF receptor 2 (Flk 1) promoter containing an endothelial cell enhancer driving the expression of nuclear-localized yellow fluorescent protein (YFP). Expression of this marker has been shown previously to correlate with the establishment of new vasculature, and the nuclear localization of YFP expression allowed us to quantify changes in endothelial cell numbers. We found a significant increase in Flk 1 -H 2 B::YFP cells in BMP- 2 -treated animals compared with controls. The increase in endothelial progenitors occurred 3 days prior to the appearance of early cartilage. The data collectively suggest that vascular remodeling and growth may be essential to modify the microenvironment and enable engraftment of the necessary progenitors to form endochondral bone. © 2010 American Society for Bone and Mineral Research...|$|R
