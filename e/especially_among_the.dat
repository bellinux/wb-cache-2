5|$|Early Dutch missionaries faced strong {{opposition}} among Torajans, <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> elite, because {{the abolition of}} their profitable slave trade had angered them. Some Torajans were forcibly relocated to the lowlands by the Dutch, {{where they could be}} more easily controlled. Taxes were kept high, undermining the wealth of the elites. Ultimately, the Dutch influence did not subdue Torajan culture, and only a few Torajans were converted. In 1950, only 10% of the population had converted to Christianity.|$|E

5|$|Whole colonies can {{reproduce}} asexually, forming two colonies {{with the}} same genotype. The possible mechanisms include fission, bailout and fragmentation. Fission occurs in some corals, <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> family Fungiidae, where the colony splits into two or more colonies during early developmental stages. Bailout occurs when a single polyp abandons the colony and settles on a different substrate {{to create a new}} colony. Fragmentation involves individuals broken from the colony during storms or other disruptions. The separated individuals can start new colonies.|$|E

5|$|From the 17th century, the Dutch {{established}} {{trade and}} political control on Sulawesi through the Dutch East Indies Company. Over two centuries, they ignored the mountainous {{area in the}} central Sulawesi, where Torajans lived, because access was difficult and it had little productive agricultural land. In the late 19th century, the Dutch became increasingly concerned about the spread of Islam {{in the south of}} Sulawesi, <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> Makassarese and Bugis peoples. The Dutch saw the animist highlanders as potential Christians. In the 1920s, the Reformed Missionary Alliance of the Dutch Reformed Church began missionary work aided by the Dutch colonial government. In addition to introducing Christianity, the Dutch abolished slavery and imposed local taxes. A line was drawn around the Sa'dan area and called Tana Toraja ("the land of Toraja"). Tana Toraja was first a subdivision of the Luwu kingdom that had claimed the area. In 1946, the Dutch granted Tana Toraja a regentschap, and it was recognised in 1957 as one of the regencies of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|However, as {{the fifth}} season's {{production}} period entered its final months, rumors began to circulate – <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> production crew members in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada – {{about the future}} of the series, particularly concerning whether the show would be moving to Los Angeles, California for the sixth season and whether the new recurring character of Jeffrey Spender was planned (in case David Duchovny cut back his commitment to the series) to become a replacement for Duchovny's character of Fox Mulder – either as a part-time or full-fledged substitute. Other, contradictory rumors that Owens heard were that either he or Duchovny would appear in only eight episodes of the sixth season and that his casting as Spender was a sign that the series would either be leaving Vancouver or staying there. According to the actor himself, he always knew that Duchovny would not be leaving the series but only discovered that The X-Files would indeed be moving to Los Angeles when the official announcement was made.|$|E
5|$|Informed of the revolt, al-Hajjaj {{requested}} reinforcements {{from the}} Caliph, {{but was unable}} to stop the advance of the rebel army, which is reported to have numbered 33,000 cavalry and 120,000 infantry. On 24 or 25 January 701, Ibn al-Ash'ath overwhelmed al-Hajjaj's advance guard at Tustar. At the news of this defeat, al-Hajjaj withdrew to Basra and then, as he could not possibly hold the city, left it as well for nearby al-Zawiya. Ibn al-Ash'ath entered Basra on 13 February 701. Over the next month, a series of skirmishes were fought between the forces of Ibn al-Ash'ath and al-Hajjaj, in which the former generally held the upper hand. Finally, in early March, the two armies met for a pitched battle. Ibn al-Ash'ath initially prevailed, but in the end al-Hajjaj's Syrians, under Sufyan ibn Abrad, carried off a victory. Many rebels fell, <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> qurrāʾ, forcing Ibn al-Ash'ath to withdraw to Kufa, taking with him the Kufan troops and the élite of the Basran cavalry. At Kufa, Ibn al-Ash'ath found the citadel occupied by Matar ibn Najiya, an officer from al-Mada'in, and was forced to take it by assault.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} annual Danish-inspired {{celebrations}} in town, including the town parade, Grundlovsdag (Danish Constitution Day), Fastelavn, and Æbleskiver Days. Æbleskiver are traditional Danish pancakes in a distinctive spherical shape. Æbleskiver Days {{is one of}} the town's top attractions, and has been held annually by Danish descendants for more than a hundred years. During this two-day festival held on the 4th weekend of every July, Danebod celebrates its Danish heritage and community.

5|$|With {{the bulk}} of the French Navy {{confined}} to port, the British were able to strike directly at French colonies, although their reach was limited by the significant resources required in blockading the French coast and so the size and quality of operations varied widely. In 1804, Haiti fell to a nationalist uprising supported by the Royal Navy, and in 1806 British forces secured most of the northern coast of South America from its Dutch owners. In 1807 the Danish West Indies were invaded and in 1808 Spain changed sides and allied with Britain, while Cayenne fell to an improvised force under Captain James Lucas Yeo in January 1809. The damage done to the Martinique economy during this period was severe, as British frigates raided coastal towns and shipping, and merchant vessels were prevented from trading Martinique's produce with France or allied islands. Disaffection grew on the island, <b>especially</b> <b>among</b> <b>the</b> recently emancipated black majority, and during the summer of 1808 the island's governor, Vice-amiral Louis Thomas Villaret de Joyeuse, sent urgent messages back to France requesting supplies and reinforcements. Some of these messages were intercepted by British ships and the low morale on Martinique was {{brought to the attention of}} the Admiralty, who ordered their commander on the West Indian Station, Vice-Admiral Sir Alexander Cochrane, to raise an expeditionary force from the ships and garrisons available to him and invade the island.|$|E
