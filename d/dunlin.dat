Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, <b>dunlin,</b> ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, <b>dunlin,</b> redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|Between {{the river}} {{mouth and the}} River Witham, a large expanse of {{saltmarsh}} provides breeding grounds for common redshank, Eurasian oystercatcher and reed bunting in the summer, and Eurasian wigeon, mallard, common shelduck and common teal in the winter. Birds of prey such as hen harrier and merlin feed on the flocks of linnet and twite, while the mudflats support <b>dunlin,</b> whimbrel, and bar-tailed godwit. The Lincolnshire Wildlife Trust have a reserve there, which is next to RSPB Frampton Marsh, a reserve managed by the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds.|$|E
5|$|Nationally {{important}} {{populations of}} breeding waders {{are present in}} the Outer Hebrides, including common redshank, <b>dunlin,</b> lapwing and ringed plover.

40|$|At Boundary Bay, British Columbia, Canada, Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus) {{captured}} 94 <b>Dunlins</b> (Calidris alpina) in 652 hunts. The {{two main}} hunting methods were open attacks on flying <b>Dunlins</b> (62 %) and stealth attacks on roosting or foraging <b>Dunlins</b> (35 %). Peregrines hunted throughout the day, yet the kill rate per observation hour dropped 1 ¿ 2 hr before high tide and peaked 1 ¿ 2 hr after high tide. The drop in kill rate {{coincided with the}} departure of the mass of <b>Dunlins</b> for over-ocean flights lasting 2 ¿ 4 hr. The peak in kill rate occurred just after the tide began to ebb and the <b>Dunlins</b> returned to forage in the shore zone. The hypothesis that closeness to shoreline vegetation is dangerous for <b>Dunlins</b> is supported by three converging lines of evidence: (1) the high success rate (44 %) of peregrine hunts over the shore zone compared to the rate (11 %) over tide flats and ocean; (2) the high kill rate per observation hour at high tide; and (3) the positive correlation of kill rate with the height of the tides. Seven of 13 <b>Dunlins</b> killed by Merlins (Falco columbarius) and all five <b>Dunlins</b> killed by Northern Harriers (Circus cyaneus) were also captured in the shore zone...|$|R

40|$|Kleptoparasitism {{in birds}} {{has been the}} subject of much research, and the Bald Eagle (Haliaeetus leucocephalus) is a known kleptoparasite. It has been {{reported}} to pirate ducks captured by Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus), but ours is the first study to examine the effect of kleptoparasitic Bald Eagles on the kill rate of shorebird-hunting Peregrines and indirectly on a population of <b>Dunlins</b> (Calidris alpina) wintering in coastal British Columbia. Bald Eagles increased seasonally and yearly from October 2008 to January 2011. When eagles were scarce, Peregrines hunted ducks as well as <b>Dunlins.</b> Conversely, when eagles were numerous Peregrines hunted <b>Dunlins</b> only. In 56 instances, one or more eagles closely followed hunting Peregrines and retrieved 13 <b>Dunlins</b> dropped or downed by the falcons. The Peregrines were also kleptoparasitized by Gyrfalcons (Falco rusticolus), which pirated 11 <b>Dunlins</b> from Peregrines. Observed losses to kleptoparasites amounted to 24 (36 %) of 67 Peregrines' captures. The kill rate per hour of observation was 0. 05 hr- 1 in October and November when eagles and Gyrfalcons were few but significantly higher at 0. 18 hr- 1 during January and February. In January 2011, when intraguild kleptoparasites were most abundant, the Peregrine's kill rate was 0. 30 hr- 1. These results support the hypothesis that kleptoparasites had an indirect effect on a population of wintering <b>Dunlins</b> because Peregrines compensated for prey lost to kleptoparasites by increasing their kill rate...|$|R
5|$|Numerous {{other birds}} can be seen, {{especially}} during the spring and autumn migration. Sand martins (Riparia riparia) arrive early and can usually be seen hawking over the water for insects in {{the second or third}} week of March. Flocks of tits (Paridae), swallows (Hirundinidae) and terns (Sternidae) can regularly be seen. Waders, such as lapwings (Vanellus vanellus), <b>dunlin</b> (Calidris alpina) and common snipe (Gallinago gallinago), are attracted to the muddy shores if the water level drops in autumn. By midwinter up to 55,000 gulls, mostly black-headed gull (Chroicocephalus ridibundus) and common gull (Larus canus), may be roosting. Good numbers of reed warblers (Acrocephalus scirpaceus) and sedge warblers (A. schoenobaenus) nest in the fringing reeds, along with grebes (Podicipedidae) and Eurasian coots (Fulica atra).|$|E
5|$|Over 190 {{species of}} birds have been {{identified}} near the bay, some of which {{use it as a}} feeding ground during their migrations. Waders and wildfowl often over-winter on the reserve. The populations of whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus) and black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa) are internationally important. Significant populations of <b>dunlin</b> (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope) also frequent the bay. In early winter the wigeon select Puccinellia maritima in preference to Agrostis stolonifera and Festuca rubra. Avocets have become regular autumn and winter visitors to the area in recent years, favouring the lower reaches of the River Parrett, and, {{for the first time in}} over 50 years, bred on the reserve in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Several rivers, {{including}} the Parrett, Brue and Washford, drain into the bay. Man-made drainage ditches from the Somerset Levels, {{including the}} River Huntspill, also {{run into the}} bay. The mud flats provide a habitat {{for a wide range}} of flora and fauna. These include some nationally rare plants, beetles and snails. It is particularly important for over-wintering waders and wildfowl, with approximately 190 species recorded including whimbrel (Numenius phaeopus), black-tailed godwit (Limosa limosa), <b>dunlin</b> (Calidris alpina) and wigeon (Anas penelope). Fishing has taken place using shallow boats, known as flatners, and fixed wooden structures for hundreds of years. It was also the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing'. There are several small harbours along the coast.|$|E

40|$|Wader species {{migrating}} {{through the}} Sivash (Ukraine) use hypersaline and brackish lagoons. We studied {{the use of}} the two habitat types, and focused on the profitability of Brine Shrimp Artemia salina, prey species in hypersaline lagoons for <b>Dunlins</b> Calidris alpina, Curlew Sandpipers Calidris ferruginea and Broad-billed Sandpipers Limicola falcinellus (although the latter was abundant in the brackish habitat only). Colour-marked <b>Dunlins</b> restricted feeding to the lagoon type in which they were initially captured. <b>Dunlins</b> and Curlew Sandpipers fed in areas where Brine Shrimps were of average size (0. 23 - 0. 34 mg AFDM). Artemia intake may be restricted by the visual foraging mode, as during rain and twilight pecking rates decreased to 45. 9 - 76. 8 % of values measured during dry periods in full daylight. Feeding activities were higher in hypersaline than in brackish lagoon (84. 6 and 69. 0 %, respectively). Broad-billed Sandpipers feeding on Artemia had longer handling times (0. 87 s prey(- 1)) than <b>Dunlins</b> and Curlew Sandpipers (0. 58 and 0. 54 s prey(- 1)), which performed surface tension transport (STT) of prey in their pointed, thin bills. There were no differences in body mass increases in <b>Dunlins</b> in hypersaline and brackish lagoons. In Broad-billed Sandpipers, catching results suggest an increase in body mass in the brackish lagoon only. Supported by intake rate-based calculations of potential mass gain rates, we conclude that Brine Shrimp can form a profitable prey for <b>Dunlins</b> and for Curlew Sandpipers, but apparently not for Broad-billed Sandpipers...|$|R

40|$|Myers {{proposed}} the Migration Distance Hypothesis (that {{the costs of}} long-distance migration force a compensating reduction in breeding investment) to explain parental care differences between species and sexes in shorebirds. This thesis proposes that seasonally increasing predation danger during migration is the main cost of extending breeding investment, and examines whether danger and other cross-seasonal factors predict reproductive patterns of Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> (Calidris alpina pacifica) and other shorebird species breeding in Alaska. The Predation Danger Hypothesis assumes that moult and migration schedules of shorebirds evolved to minimize exposure to raptors, especially migratory Peregrine Falcons (Falco peregrinus). The hypothesis predicts that these scheduling considerations affect parental care because they either require shorebirds to depart breeding areas early and in advance of falcon migration and moult on non-breeding areas prior to the migratory arrival of falcons; or to remain on or near northern breeding areas to moult, and migrate after falcon passage. Following breeding, Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> linger in Alaska until October, arriving on wintering areas after peak falcon passage. I found that breeding Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> renested and double-brooded extensively. Female Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> invested more time to reproduction and remained longer on the breeding grounds than female Western Sandpipers (Calidris mauri), their sympatrically-breeding, ecologically-similar, and early-migrating congener. The breeding seasons of both species were initiated on almost the same day, but the breeding investment of female Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> exceeded that of female Western Sandpipers by 7. 2 days, and the seasonal decline in parental care duration of Western Sandpipers was steeper than in Pacific <b>Dunlins.</b> As predicted, Western Sandpipers but not Pacific <b>Dunlins</b> departed sooner in years with early falcon southward migration (related to snowmelt timing), and they gave up more breeding opportunity to do so. Stable isotope analyses showed that <b>Dunlins</b> and other sandpipers are primarily income rather than capital breeders and I found little support for the Differential Parental Capacity Hypothesis (that female shorebirds truncate care due to higher investment in egg production). These findings support the Predation Danger Hypothesis and highlight how predation danger can have far-reaching impacts on the life histories of potential prey species...|$|R
40|$|One pair of Short-eared Owls nested on Griend, an islet in the Dutch Wadden Sea, in 1992, 1994, 1995 and 1996. The species never bred on Griend {{prior to}} the 1990 s. In the four years one, one, four and zero chicks fledged. Growth of the chicks showed {{differences}} corresponding with hatching order. Oldest chicks grew faster than their younger siblings. In 1996, chicks grew notably slower than in 1995. Pellets and plucking remains found {{in the immediate vicinity}} of the chicks revealed that <b>Dunlins</b> and Wood Mice made up 69 and 28 %, respectively, of prey items in 1995. Other avian prey included Redshank, Turnstone, Common- and Arctic Tern. In 1996, however, Wood Mice made up 76 % of prey items, while <b>Dunlins</b> accounted for only 8 %. Timing of the start of the breeding season seems important for the Short-eared Owl on Griend. It is suggested that the islands' Wood Mice population alone does not allow for optimal growth and survival of owl chicks. When owls started breeding relatively early (1995 : late March), <b>Dunlins,</b> present in large flocks, constituted an additional prey during the chick rearing period. This resulted in fast chick growth and good breeding success. In 1992 and 1996, <b>Dunlins</b> disappeared to migrate to their breeding areas one week after owl eggs had hatched; consequently, chick survival was low. Wood Mice were inadvertently introduced to the island in 1988...|$|R

40|$|During {{the annual}} cycle, migratory waders may face strikingly {{different}} feeding conditions {{as they move}} between breeding areas and wintering grounds. Thus, it is of crucial importance that they rapidly adjust their behaviour and diet to benefit from peaks of prey abundance, in particular during migration, {{when they need to}} accumulate energy at a fast pace. In this study, we compared foraging behaviour and diet of wintering and northward migrating <b>dunlins</b> in the Tagus estuary, Portugal, by video-recording foraging birds and analysing their droppings. We also estimated energy intake rates and analysed variations in prey availability, including those that were active at the sediment surface. Wintering and northward migrating <b>dunlins</b> showed clearly different foraging behaviour and diet. In winter, birds predominantly adopted a tactile foraging technique (probing), mainly used to search for small buried bivalves, with some visual surface pecking to collect gastropods and crop bivalve siphons. Contrastingly, in spring <b>dunlins</b> generally used a visual foraging strategy, mostly to consume worms, but also bivalve siphons and shrimps. From winter to spring, we found a marked increase both in the biomass of invertebrate prey in the sediment and in the surface activity of worms and siphons. The combination of these two factors, together with the availability of shrimps in spring, most likely explains the changes in the diet and foraging behaviour of <b>dunlins.</b> Northward migrating birds took advantage from the improved feeding conditions in spring, achieving 65 % higher energy intake rates as compared with wintering birds. Building on these results and on known daily activity budgets for this species, our results suggest that Tagus estuary provides high-quality feeding conditions for birds during their stopovers, enabling high fattening rates. These findings show that this large wetland plays a key role as a stopover site for migratory waders within the East Atlantic Flyway...|$|R
