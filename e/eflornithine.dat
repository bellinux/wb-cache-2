25|$|Prevention {{of severe}} disease {{involves}} screening {{the population at}} risk with blood tests for TbG. Treatment is easier when the disease is detected early and before neurological symptoms occur. Treatment of the first stage is with the medications pentamidine or suramin. Treatment of the second stage involves <b>eflornithine</b> {{or a combination of}} nifurtimox and <b>eflornithine</b> for TbG. While melarsoprol works for both stages, it is typically only used for TbR, due to serious side effects. Without treatment it typically results in death.|$|E
25|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} drug Vaniqa, {{with the}} active ingredient <b>eflornithine</b> hydrochloride, inhibits the enzyme ornithine decarboxylase, preventing new hair cells from producing putrescine for stabilizing their DNA.|$|E
25|$|<b>Eflornithine</b> (difluoromethylornithine or DFMO), {{the most}} modern treatment, was {{developed}} in the 1970s by Albert Sjoerdsma and underwent clinical trials in the 1980s. The drug was approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration in 1990. Aventis, the company responsible for its manufacture, halted production in 1999. In 2001, Aventis, in association with Médecins Sans Frontières and the World Health Organization, signed a long-term agreement to manufacture and donate the drug.|$|E
25|$|Other {{drugs with}} anti-androgen effects include flutamide, and spironolactone, which can give some {{improvement}} in hirsutism. Metformin can reduce hirsutism, perhaps by reducing insulin resistance, {{and is often}} used if there are other features such as insulin resistance, diabetes, or obesity that should also benefit from metformin. <b>Eflornithine</b> (Vaniqa) is a drug that {{is applied to the}} skin in cream form, and acts directly on the hair follicles to inhibit hair growth. It is usually applied to the face. 5-alpha reductase inhibitors (such as finasteride and dutasteride) may also be used; they work by blocking the conversion of testosterone to dihydrotestosterone (the latter of which responsible for most hair growth alterations and androgenic acne).|$|E
2500|$|Medications for PCOS include oral {{contraceptives}} and metformin. [...] The {{oral contraceptives}} increase sex hormone binding globulin production, which increases binding of free testosterone. [...] This reduces {{the symptoms of}} hirsutism caused by high testosterone and regulates return to normal menstrual periods. Metformin is a drug commonly used in type 2 diabetes to reduce insulin resistance, and is used off label (in the UK, US, AU and EU) to treat insulin resistance seen in PCOS. [...] In many cases, metformin also supports ovarian function and return to normal ovulation. Spironolactone {{can be used for}} its antiandrogenic effects, and the topical cream <b>eflornithine</b> can be used to reduce facial hair. A newer insulin resistance drug class, the thiazolidinediones (glitazones), have shown equivalent efficacy to metformin, but metformin has a more favorable side effect profile. The United Kingdom's National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin when other therapy has failed to produce results. Metformin may not be effective in every type of PCOS, and therefore there is some disagreement about whether it should be used as a general first line therapy. The use of statins in the management of underlying metabolic syndrome remains unclear.|$|E

50|$|Other {{studies have}} {{suggested}} that <b>eflornithine</b> can still aid in some chemoprevention by lowering polyamine levels in colorectal mucosa, with additional strong preclinical evidence available for application of <b>eflornithine</b> in colorectal and skin carcinogenesis. This has made <b>eflornithine</b> a supported chemopreventive therapy specifically for colon cancer in combination with other medications. Several additional studies have found that <b>eflornithine</b> in combination with other compounds decreases the carcinogen concentrations of ethylnitrosourea, dimethylhydrazine, azoxymethane, methylnitrosourea, and hydroxybutylnitrosamine in the brain, spinal cord, intestine, mammary gland, and urinary bladder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Eflornithine</b> is also {{effective}} {{in combination with}} other drugs, such as melarsoprol and nifurtimox. A study in 2005 compared the safety of <b>eflornithine</b> alone to melarsoprol and found <b>eflornithine</b> to be more effective and safe in treating second-stage sleeping sickness Trypanosoma brucei gambiense. <b>Eflornithine</b> is not {{effective in}} the treatment of Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense due to the parasite's low sensitivity to the drug. Instead, melarsoprol is used to treat Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense. Another randomized control trial in Uganda compared the efficacy of various combinations of these drugs and found that the nifurtimox-eflornithine combination was the most promising first-line theory regimen.|$|E
50|$|The gene TbAAT6, conserved in {{the genome}} of Trypanosomes, is {{believed}} to be responsible for the transmembrane transporter that brings <b>eflornithine</b> into the cell. The loss of this gene due to specific mutations causes resistance to <b>eflornithine</b> in several trypanosomes. If <b>eflornithine</b> is prescribed to a patient with Human African trypanosomiasis caused by a trypanosome that contains a mutated or ineffective TbAAT6 gene, then the medication will be ineffective against the disease. Resistance to <b>eflornithine</b> has increased the use of melarsoprol despite its toxicity, which has been linked to the deaths of 5% of recipient HAT patients.|$|E
50|$|Combination {{therapy with}} <b>eflornithine</b> and {{nifurtimox}} is safer and easier than treatment with <b>eflornithine</b> alone, {{and appears to}} be equally or more effective. It has been recommended as first-line treatment for second-stage African trypanosomiasis.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Efl{{ornithine}}</b> is a [...] "suicide inhibitor," [...] irreversibly binding to {{ornithine decarboxylase}} (ODC) and preventing the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active site (Figure 1). Within the active site of ODC, <b>eflornithine</b> undergoes decarboxylation {{with the aid}} of cofactor pyridoxal 5’-phosphate (PLP). Because of its additional difluoromethyl group in comparison to ornithine, <b>eflornithine</b> is able to bind to a neighboring Cys-360 residue, permanently remaining fixated within the active site.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, Gillette {{was awarded}} a patent for the {{discovery}} that topical application of <b>eflornithine</b> HCl cream inhibits hair growth. In the 1990s, Gillette conducted dose-ranging studies with <b>eflornithine</b> in hirsute women that demonstrated that the drug slows the rate of facial hair growth. Gillette then filed a patent for the formulation of <b>eflornithine</b> cream. In July 2000, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) granted a New Drug Application for Vaniqa. The following year, the European Commission issued its Marketing Authorisation.|$|E

However, since African trypanosomiasis has a high mortality rate if left untreated, treatment with <b>eflornithine</b> may justify any potential risk to the fetus.|$|E
50|$|After its {{introduction}} to {{the market in the}} 1980s, <b>eflornithine</b> has replaced melarsoprol as the first line medication against Human African trypanosomiasis (HAT) due to its reduced toxicity to the host.

50|$|Eflornithine's suicide {{inhibition}} of ODC physically blocks the natural substrate ornithine from accessing the active {{site of the}} enzyme (Figure 3). There are two distinct active sites formed by the homodimerization of ornithine decarboxylase. The size of the opening to the active site is approximately 13.6 Å. When these openings to the active site are blocked, {{there are no other}} ways through which ornithine can enter the active site. During the intermediate stage of <b>eflornithine</b> with PLP, its position near Cys-360 allows an interaction to occur. As the phosphate of PLP is stabilized by Arg 277 and a Gly-rich loop (235-237), the difluoromethyl group of <b>eflornithine</b> is able to interact and remain fixated to both Cys-360 and PLP prior to transimination.As shown in the figure, the pyrroline ring interferes with ornithine's entry (Figure 4). <b>Eflornithine</b> will remain permanently bound in this position to Cys-360. As ODC has two active sites, two <b>eflornithine</b> molecules are required to completely inhibit ODC from ornithine decarboxylation.|$|E

50|$|It {{has been}} noted that {{ornithine}} decarboxylase (ODC) exhibits high activity in tumor cells, promoting cell growth and division, while absence of ODC activity leads to depletion of putrescine, causing impairment of RNA and DNA synthesis. Typically, drugs that inhibit cell growth are considered candidates for cancer therapy, so <b>eflornithine</b> was naturally believed to have potential utility as an anti-cancer agent. By inhibiting ODC, <b>eflornithine</b> inhibits cell growth and division of both cancerous and noncancerous cells.|$|E
50|$|The {{reaction}} mechanism of Trypanosoma brucei's ODC with ornithine {{was characterized by}} UV-VIS spectroscopy {{in order to identify}} unique intermediates that occurred during the reaction. The specific method of multiwavelength stopped-flow spectroscopy utilized monochromatic light and fluorescence to identify five specific intermediates due to changes in absorbance measurements. The steady-state turnover number, kcat, of ODC was calculated to be 0.5 s-1 at 4 °C. From this characterization, the rate-limiting step was determined to be the release of the product putrescine from ODC's reaction with ornithine.In studying the hypothetical {{reaction mechanism}} for <b>eflornithine,</b> information collected from radioactive peptide and <b>eflornithine</b> mapping, high pressure liquid chromatography, and gas phase peptide sequencing suggested that Lys-69 and Cys-360 are covalently bound to <b>eflornithine</b> in T. brucei ODC's active site. Utilizing fast-atom bombardment mass spectrometry (FAB-MS), the structural conformation of <b>eflornithine</b> following its interaction with ODC was determined to be S-((2-(1-pyrroline-methyl) cysteine, a cyclic imine adduct. Presence of this particular product was supported by the possibility to further reduce the end product to S-((2-pyrrole) methyl) cysteine in the presence of NaBH4 and oxidize the end product to S-((2-pyrrolidine) methyl) cysteine (Figure 2).|$|E
