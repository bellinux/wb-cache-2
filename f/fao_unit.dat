40|$|External {{program and}} {{management}} review of IPGRI conducted between March 1996 and February 1997 {{by a panel}} chaired by Calvin Qualset. The document contains {{an excerpt from the}} summary of the CGIAR meeting of May 1997, a transmittal letter from the TAC Chairman and CGIAR Executive Secretary, TAC comments, IPGRI's response, and a transmittal letter from the review panel chair. This is the second review of the institute following its transition from an <b>FAO</b> <b>unit</b> to independent status. The panel notes considerable expansion of staff and funding, as well as the addition of responsibility for bananas and plantains under INIBAP. IPGRI is not a research organization primarily, but a service organization, which serves as well as coordinator for the Systemwide Genetic Resources Program (SGRP). Its strategy is intended to protect genetic resources for future use. The panel made a very positive report, with 16 recommendations. Among these was the use of competitive methods in subcontracting research, strengthened program planning and review, and an active role in ensuring that IARC representatives can participate authoritatively in strategic planning, and consult about options for programmatic integration of CGIAR germplasm efforts. It also noted that IPGRI Board members work as individuals with virtually no committee structure. TAC saw a need for rigorous priority setting, given IPGRI's broad subject matter and mandate. Linkages between strategic planning and operational aspects needed to be strengthened. TAC also urged more attention to impact assessment, and improved coordination on banana and plantain with IITA. An external review of SGRP would address issues raised about global planning, and the articulation and representation of CGIAR policies on genetic resources. TAC was not in favor of having a staff legal expert at IPGRI, but encouraged more work on policy, including collaboration with IFPRI...|$|E
40|$|The new FAO seafood price indices {{have been}} {{constructed}} based on import statistics for USA and the European Union. The main objective of the FAO seafood import price indices is to indicate quarterly to annual price trends for key seafood products. Two previous FAO studies have presented seafood price indices together with issues and methodologies involved with constructing them (Kiel, 1993; Doglia, 1999). This study builds on those two, but here we {{take advantage of the}} increased availability of seafood trade statistics through the Internet. The price indices presented here only cover a small part of global seafood trade, which imply that numerous seafood markets have been omitted. The scope was limited to keep the workload at manageable proportions. Fresh salmon, frozen shrimp, frozen cod and canned tuna products in the EU and the US markets are targeted for the price indices. Most indices start from January 1989 or early 1990 s. The selection covers two of the largest seafood markets (Japanese seafood imports are larger than the US in value, but is disregarded because of less accessible trade statistics). Likewise, the products are in terms of value among the most important in international seafood trade. There are clear advantages of focusing on such widely traded products: (1) because of their importance in seafood trade, they can be indicative {{for the price of a}} number of related seafood products, (2) more reliable and consistent data are available for these products compared with many other seafood products, and (3) by limiting the selection to a few key products and key markets the work will be kept at manageable proportions. The FAO seafood price indices are representative for a limited number of species and markets. The performance of the price indices is compared against price data for similar products from the Globefish databank. Overall the unit values mimic prices better than what might initially have been expected. For several reasons, however, there can be considerable discrepancies between price-based index and the <b>FAO</b> <b>unit</b> value based import price indices. Similar but not identical products are being compared, the unit values suffer from compositional effects, and the lag effect in trade data all contribute to the discreapancies. Despite these discrepancies the unit values indices appear to capture the major price trends in the markets. Statistical tests provide further evidence that there is a strong relationship between the unit values and prices series in the long run...|$|E

40|$|International audiencePedodiversity, {{the study}} and {{measurement}} of soil diversity, may {{be considered as a}} framework to analyze spatial patterns. Recently, selfsimilar multifractal patterns have been recently reported in the pedotaxa-abundance distributions at the planetary scale. This is the result to be expected from the complexity of earth soil systems. When the state of soil is understood as the outcome of nonlinear chaotic dynamic, highly irregular patterns with so-called multifractal behavior should be common. This opens the opportunity to use parameters of fractal theory to characterize pedodiversity. We compute Rényi generalized dimensions for the abundance distribution of pedotaxa for the five landmasses and the whole World drawn from the most detailed available global dataset based on the second level of the <b>FAO</b> 1974 classification <b>units.</b> We explore the effective relationship between diversity indices and Rényi dimensions. We show how multifractal analysis unifies diversity indices and how they should be interpreted offering a coherent perspective with a single mathematical procedure to analyze spatial patterns of the pedosphere...|$|R

40|$|This {{harmonized}} set of soil parameter {{estimates for}} Central Africa, comprising Burundi, the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Rwanda, {{was derived from}} the Soil and Terrain Database for Central Africa (SOTERCAF ver. 1. 0) and the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database, using standardized taxonomy-based pedotransfer (taxotransfer) procedures. The land surface of Central Africa, [...] . comprising some 2. 4 million km 2, has been characterized using 244 unique SOTER units, corresponding with 504 polygons. Each SOTER unit may consist of up to 6 soil components; each of these has been characterized by a representative profile. The main soil units mapped for the region have been characterized using 167 real profiles, selected by soil experts as being regionally representative for these units. The associated soil analytical data have been derived from soil survey reports. Gaps in the measured soil data have been filled using a scheme of using a step-wise procedure that uses taxotransfer rules. These rules were developed using some 5672 soil profiles, held in the ISRIC-WISE database, having similar <b>FAO</b> soil <b>unit</b> names as those reported in the primary SOTERCAF database. Parameter estimates are presented by soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 0. 2 m to 1 m depth for: organic carbon, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH(H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, base saturation, effective CEC, aluminium saturation, CaCO 3 content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity of saturated paste (ECe), bulk density, content of sand, silt and clay, content of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), and available water capacity (- 33 kPa to - 1. 5 MPa). These attributes have been identified as being useful for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil carbon stocks and change, and analyses of global environmental change. The current parameter estimates should be seen as best estimates based on the current selection of soil profiles and data clustering procedure.

40|$|Version 1. 2 of {{describes}} a harmonized dataset of derived soil properties for the world. It was created using the soil distribution {{shown on the}} 1 : 5 million scale FAO-Unesco Soil Map of the World (DSMW), rasterised at 5 by 5 arcminutes, and soil property estimates derived from the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database, version 3. 1. The dataset considers 19 soil variables that are commonly required for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil gaseous emissions, and analyses of global environmental change. It presents ‘best’ estimates for: soil drainage class, organic carbon content, total nitrogen, C/N ratio, pH (H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, effective CEC, base saturation, aluminium saturation, calcium carbonate content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity, particle size distribution (i. e. content of sand, silt and clay), content of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), bulk density, and available water capacity (- 33 to - 1500 kPa). These estimates are presented by <b>FAO</b> soil <b>unit</b> for fixed depth intervals of 20 cm up to 100 cm depth (or less when appropriate) for so-called virtual profiles. The associated soil property values were derived from analyses of some 10, 250 profiles held in WISE using a scheme of taxonomy-based taxotransfer rules complemented with expert-rules. The type of rules used to derive the various soil property values have been flagged in the database to provide {{an indication of the}} possible confidence in the derived data. Most map units on the DSMW are complex, comprising up to eight different soil units. Assessments and model applications that use the derived soil properties therefore should consider the full map unit composition and depth range. The soil property values presented here should be seen as best estimates based on the current selection of soil profiles in WISE, the procedure for clustering the measured data, taxotransfer scheme used for deriving soil, properties, and the spatial data of the digital Soil Map of the World. The derived information may be used for exploratory assessments at a broad scale (< 1 : 5 million; 5 by 5 arcminutes and coarser), pending the global update of the information on world soil resources at more detailed scales, upon due consideration of the underlying generalisations and assumptions...|$|R
40|$|This {{data set}} {{describes}} a harmonized set of soil parameter estimates for Senegal and The Gambia. It {{was derived from}} the Soil and Terrain Database for Senegal and The Gambia (SENSOTER ver. 1. 0) and the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database, using standardized taxonomy-based pedotransfer (taxotransfer) procedures. The land surface of the study area, covering some 200 800 km 2, has been characterized using 149 unique SOTER units. Each SOTER unit consists of up to four different soil components. In so far as possible, each soil component has been characterized by a regionally representative profile, selected and classified by national soil experts. Conversely, {{in the absence of any}} measured legacy data, soil components were characterized using synthetic profiles for which only the FAO-Unesco (1988) classification is known. Soil components in SENSOTER have been characterized using 90 profiles of which 34 are synthetic. The latter represent some 37 per cent of the territory. Comprehensive sets of measured attribute data are not available for most of the measured profiles (56) collated in SENSOTER. Consequently, to permit modelling, gaps in the soil analytical data have been filled using consistent taxotransfer procedures. Modal soil parameter estimates necessary to populate the taxotransfer procedure were derived from statistical analyses of soil profiles held in the ISRIC-WISE database. The current procedure only considers profiles in WISE that have <b>FAO</b> soil <b>unit</b> names identical to those mapped for SOTER-Senegal (41) and that originate from the Tropics (n= 4510). Parameter estimates are presented for 18 soil variables by soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 0. 2 m to 1 m depth. Thes include: organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH(H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, base saturation, effective CEC, aluminium saturation, CaCO 3 content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity (ECE), bulk density, content of sand, silt and clay, content of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), and available water capacity (- 33 kPa to - 1. 5 MPa). These attributes have been identified as being useful for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil carbon stocks and change, and analyses of global environmental change. The current parameter estimates should be seen as best estimates based on the current selection of soil profiles and data clustering procedure. Taxotransfer rules have been flagged to provide an indication of the confidence in the derived data. Soil parameter estimates are presented as summary files (in MS-Access format) which can be linked to the SENSOTER map using GIS, through the unique SOTER-unit code (NEWSUID). The derived (secondary) soil data for Senegal and The Gambia are considered appropriate for exploratory studies at national scale (1 : 1 million); these should consider the full map unit composition...|$|R

It has been {{derived from the}} 1 : 1 million scale Soil and Terrain Database for the country (SOTER_TN, ver. 1. 0) and the ISRIC-WISE soil profile database, using standardized taxonomy-based pedotransfer (taxotransfer) procedures. The land surface of Tunisia, covering some 164, 150 km 2, has been characterized in SOTER_TN [...] . using 250 unique SOTER units. Each map unit consists of up to four different soil components. In so far as possible, each soil component has been characterized by a regionally representative profile, selected and classified by national soil experts (see Dijkshoorn et al. 2008). Conversely, {{in the absence of}} any measured legacy data, soil components were characterized using synthetic profiles for which only the FAO-Unesco (1988) classification is known. Soil components in SOTER_TN have been characterized using 100 profiles of which 44 are synthetic. The latter represent some 59 per cent of the territory. Comprehensive sets of measured attribute data are not available for most of the measured profiles (56) collated in SOTER_TN, as these were not considered in the source materials. Consequently, to permit modelling, gaps in the soil analytical data have been filled using consistent taxotransfer procedures. Modal soil property estimates necessary to populate the taxotransfer procedure were derived from statistical analyses of soil profiles held in the ISRIC-WISE database ― the current taxotransfer procedure only considers profiles in WISE that: (a) have <b>FAO</b> soil <b>unit</b> names identical to those mapped for Tunisia in SOTER, and (b) originate from regions having similar Köppen climate zones (n= 3566). Property estimates are presented for 18 soil variables by soil unit for fixed depth intervals of 0. 2 m to 1 m depth: organic carbon, total nitrogen, pH(H 2 O), CECsoil, CECclay, base saturation, effective CEC, aluminium saturation, CaCO 3 content, gypsum content, exchangeable sodium percentage (ESP), electrical conductivity (ECe), bulk density, content of sand, silt and clay, content of coarse fragments (> 2 mm), and volumetric water content (- 33 kPa to - 1. 5 MPa). These attributes have been identified as being useful for agro-ecological zoning, land evaluation, crop growth simulation, modelling of soil carbon stocks and change, and studies of global environmental change.

40|$|The study {{investigated}} relationships between agricultural policy output (proxy by the agricultural productivity index, agricultural GDP/total GDP and crop productivity index) and output of industrial sector (proxy by the industrial capacity utilization rate) from 1970 to 2012 period in Nigeria. The study employed time series variables {{obtained from the}} Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN), National Bureau of Statistics and Food and Agricultural Organization (<b>FAO).</b> Augmented Dickey-Fuller <b>unit</b> root test {{was conducted on the}} specified time series, and the result showed that all non-growth rate series were integrated of order one, while growth rate series were stationary at level. The two-step Engle Granger method was employed to test for the presence of cointegration among specified variables. The result revealed that variables were not co-integrated. To avoid spurious regression, the specified models for non-growth rate series were estimated at first difference of the log variables. The empirical result revealed that, the industrial activities Granger cause crop activities in Nigeria. Also, the industrial activity has insignificant relationship with agricultural productivity indices in Nigeria. The same result was also obtained for industrial activities and agricultural GDP/total GDP. However, the result further revealed that, the industrial activity has significant negative correlation with the crop productivity index in Nigeria. These imply that, agricultural production had not played significant role in industrial development in Nigeria. This result suggests that, there is no significant impact of the backward integration policy of the agricultural sector on industrial sector in Nigeria. In addition, the result revealed that, agricultural policies during liberalization era (1986 - 2012) shifted the coefficient of the industrial activities positively. Therefore, it is recommended that the agricultural production in Nigeria should be boosted so as to generate sufficient demand and raw materials for the industrial sector. Agricultural policy of the liberalization period should be promoted as an alternative way to bring on positive growth in industrial activities and hence economic development in Nigeria...|$|R
