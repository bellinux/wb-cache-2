40|$|Objective: To analyze {{histological}} {{aspects of}} ovaries {{as well as}} the ovulation of adult mice treated with the anabolic agent <b>hexestrol.</b> Methods: Thirty adult mice were divided into three groups of 10 animals each: (GI) the animals received a dose of 3 mg/kg of hexestrol; (GII) the animals were given a dose of 6 mg/kg of hexestrol; (GIII) the animals were injected with distilled water (vehicle). Another 10 -animal group (GIV) was included, and these mice were injected with propionate testosterone (1. 25 mg) after 5 days from the day of birth. <b>Hexestrol</b> was administered intraperitoneally once a day and the treatment lasted 30 days. the mice were then sacrificed; their ovaries and oviducts were removed, submitted to histological routine and analyzed under light microscopy. Results: in mice treated with <b>hexestrol</b> (6 mg/kg) (Group II), ovaries were smaller than those from the controls but highly vascularized; similar results were obtained in GIV. A great number of follicles in several stages of development were found however, with no corpora lutea - in six animals in GII No corpora lutea were found in GIV. the number of luteal bodies and oocytes in GII was lower than that in GI or GIII. No oocytes were detected in GIV. Finally, the nuclear volume of interstitial cells in GII and GIV was the largest.

After 30, 60, 90 and 120 days respectively, blood, urine, muscle tissue (by biopsy) samples were harvested in order to determine, through electrochemioiluminescence, the concentrations of the residue of this steroidal compound. Ovaries were also harvested through ovarioectomy for histo-pathological examination. The maximum levels of this hormone residue were identified in urine (the average value being 652, 4 pg/ml, for group I), intermediate values in blood samples (43. 74 pg/ml), while the muscle samples revealed concentrations inferior to the detection limit for the utilized method (18. 4 pg/g).
