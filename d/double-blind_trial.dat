50|$|The first Phase III {{clinical}} trial {{to evaluate the}} efficacy and safety of pirfenidone {{for the treatment of}} patients with IPF was conducted in Japan.

Pirfenidone 1800 or 1200 mg/day reduced the mean decline in vital capacity from baseline to week 52 compared with placebo. Progression-free survival was also improved with pirfenidone compared with placebo.|$|E
50|$|However, the Schou-Baastrup {{prophylaxis}} {{hypothesis was}} met with great resistance by British psychiatry. To Aubrey Lewis and Michael Shepherd, lithium was ‘dangerous nonsense’. Shepherd, seconded by Harry Blackwell, simply characterized it as ‘a therapeutic myth’, which, in their opinion, was based on ‘serious methodological shortcomings’ and ‘spurious claims’. Even terms such as unethical and unscientific were used. After consideration of the ethical aspects invoked, Schou and Baastrup undertook a <b>double-blind</b> <b>trial</b> of prospective-discontinuation design and with random allocation of manic-depressive patients (already on lithium) to lithium or placebo. It confirmed their hypothesis, published in The Lancet in 1970.|$|E

5000|$|Latrepirdine {{attracted}} {{renewed interest}} in 2009 after being shown in small preclinical trials to have positive effects on persons suffering from Alzheimer's disease. Animal studies showing potential beneficial effects on Alzheimer's disease models were shown in Russian research in 2000. Preliminary results from human trials have also been promising. In an initial six-month phase II trial, results have shown significant improvement over placebo at 12 months. Latrepirdine showed promising results in a phase III-equivalent, <b>double-blind</b> <b>trial</b> in Russia with mild-moderate stage patients.

It is an approved therapy for treatment-resistant depression in the EU and US and is sometimes used as an adjunct to existing antidepressant treatment. The support for this method comes mainly from open-label trials, which indicate that several months may be required to see a benefit. The only large <b>double-blind</b> <b>trial</b> conducted lasted only 10 weeks and yielded inconclusive results; VNS failed to show superiority over a sham treatment on the primary efficacy outcome, but the results were more favorable for one of the secondary outcomes.

50|$|A single {{study in}} humans was {{reported}} in 1978. The <b>double-blind</b> <b>trial</b> of PRL-8-53 in 47 healthy volunteers measured its effects {{on a variety of}} cognitive measures. 5 mg of the drug was administered orally 2-2.5 hours before the study tasks. Overall improvements in recollection differed based on how many words were recalled under placebo, with the poor performers (six words or fewer) experiencing a 87.5-105% increase in recollection and the high performers (eight or more words) a 7.9-14% increase which failed to reach statistical significance; when controlling for subjects over the age of 30 only, a 108-152% increase was noted. The researchers noted that this was likely a result of a ceiling effect due to many of their subjects scoring close to 100% on the recall test even on placebo. No side effects were reported during the trial.|$|E
30|$|In late 1980 s, clinicians transplanted human {{embryonic}} or fetal ventral mesencephalic tissues into PD patients, {{but the results}} were varied. In Madrazo and Lindvall’s open-label trials, PD patients showed improvement of Unified Parkinson’s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS) after receiving fetal DA neuron graft (Madrazo et al. 1988; Lindvall et al. 1989). However, the results from two <b>double-blind</b> <b>trials</b> funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in the 1990 s showed no significant effects (Freed et al. 2001; Olanow et al. 2003). Even more, several side-effects have been shown in PD patients who received these transplantations. The results of these two open-label and <b>double-blind</b> <b>trials</b> raise critical issues regarding ethical considerations, and may enhance controversy which can dissuade the potential use of transplants for PD.|$|R

50|$|Therapeutic {{strategies}} {{have been based}} on either blocking cytokines synthesis or their action. Thalidomide has been demonstrated to suppress TNF-alpha production in monocytes in vitro and to normalize elevated TNF-alpha levels in vivo. A randomized, placebo-controlled trial in patients with cancer cachexia showed the drug was well tolerated and effective at attenuating loss of weight and lean body mass (LBM) in patients with advanced pancreatic cancer. An improvement in the LBM and improved quality of life were also observed in a randomized, <b>double-blind</b> <b>trial</b> using a protein and energy-dense, omega-3 fatty acids-enriched oral supplement, provided its consumption was equal or superior to 2.2 g of eicosapentaenoic acid per day. It is also through decreasing TNF-alpha production. However, data arising from a large, multicenter, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial indicate EPA administration alone is not successful in the treatment of weight loss in patients with advanced gastrointestinal or lung cancer.|$|E

40|$|Ketolides are a {{new class}} of semi-synthetic agents derived from {{erythromycin}} A designed to overcome erythromycin A resistance in Streptococcus pneumoniae. Telithromycin (HMR 3647) is the first member of this new class to be approved for clinical use. Cethromycin (ABT- 773) has been developed up to Phase III, but its further development seems questionable at the moment. Other ketolides are only in the first stages of preclinical development and may not be available within the foreseeable future. Ketolide compounds inhibit bacterial protein synthesis by interacting with the peptidyl transferase site of the 50 S ribosomal subunit, and interact closely with domains II at A 752 and V at A 2058 and A 2059 of the 23 S rRNA. These compounds also inhibit the formation of the 50 S subunit of the ribosome. Ketolides show good activity against the Gram-positive bacteria responsible for respiratory tract infections including penicillin G- and erythromycin A-resistant S. pneumoniae. The 15 clinical trials with telithromycin published to date include four randomized, <b>double-blind</b> comparative <b>trials</b> and three open-label studies in community-acquired pneumonia, three randomized <b>double-blind</b> <b>trials</b> in acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, two randomized <b>double-blind</b> <b>trials</b> in pharyngitis, and two <b>double-blind</b> comparative <b>trials</b> and one open-label trial in acute maxillary sinusitis.
