40|$|In an {{electric}} vehicle powertrain, a boost dc-dc converter enables size {{reduction of the}} electric machine and optimization of the battery system. Design of the powertrain boost converter is challenging because the converter must be rated at high peak power, while efficiency at medium to light load is critical for the vehicle system performance. The previously proposed efficiency improvement approaches only offer limited improvements in size, cost and efficiency trade-offs. In this work, the concept of composite converter architectures is proposed. By emphasizing the direct / indirect power path explicitly, this approach addresses all dominant loss mechanisms, resulting in fundamental efficiency improvements over wide ranges of operating conditions. The key component of composite converter approach, the DC Transformer (DCX) converter, is extensively discussed in this work, and important improvements are proposed. It enhances the DCX efficiency over <b>full</b> <b>power</b> <b>range,</b> and more than ten times loss reduction is achieved at the no load condition. Several composite converter prototypes are presented, ranging from 10 kW to 60 kW rated power.

With peak efficiency of 98. 5 % to 98. 7 % recorded, the prototypes show superior efficiency over a wide operation range. Comparing with the conventional approach, {{it is found that}} the composite converter results in a decrease in the total loss by a factor of two to four for typical drive cycles.

To sustain the charging and discharging states of the ultracapacitor, a bidirectional DC–DC converter is required. Based on a comprehensive overview on different DC–DC converter topologies, the research presented here has shown that, bidirectional voltage–fed topology is better suited for dealing with the fast dynamic response of the ultracapacitor. But for a wide input voltage variation, this topology exhibits a higher circulating power flow and higher conduction losses as a consequence. Therefore, a detailed analysis of the bidirectional converter exploring the impact of the circulating power flow interval is developed in this study. Analytic methods have been applied to establish the optimal operation of the bidirectional voltage–fed converter for an ultracapacitor to improve its performance and efficiency.

40|$|This report {{provides}} {{an update on}} development of a pre-conceptual design for the Small Secure Transportable Autonomous Reactor (SSTAR) Lead-Cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) plant concept and supporting research and development activities. SSTAR is a small, 20 MWe (45 MWt), natural circulation, fast reactor plant for international deployment concept incorporating proliferation resistance for deployment in non-fuel cycle states and developing nations, fissile self-sufficiency for efficient utilization of uranium resources, autonomous load following making it suitable for small or immature grid applications, and {{a high degree of}} passive safety further supporting deployment in developing nations. In FY 2006, improvements have been made at ANL to the pre-conceptual design of both the reactor system and the energy converter which incorporates a supercritical carbon dioxide Brayton cycle providing higher plant efficiency (44 %) and improved economic competitiveness. The supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle technology is also applicable to Sodium-Cooled Fast Reactors providing the same benefits. One key accomplishment has been the development of a control strategy for automatic control of the supercritical CO 2 Brayton cycle in principle enabling autonomous load following over the <b>full</b> <b>power</b> <b>range</b> between nominal and essentially zero power. Under autonomous load following operation, the reactor core power adjusts itself to equal the heat removal from the reactor system to the power converter through the large reactivity feedback of the fast spectrum core without the need for motion of control rods, while the automatic control of the power converter matches the heat removal from the reactor to the grid load. The report includes early calculations for an international benchmarking problem for a LBE-cooled, nitride-fueled fast reactor core organized by the IAEA as part of a Coordinated Research Project on Small Reactors without Onsite Refueling; the calculations use the same neutronics computer codes and methodologies applied to SSTAR. Another section of the report details the SSTAR safety design approach which is based upon defense-in-depth providing multiple levels of protection against the release of radioactive materials and how the inherent safety features of the lead coolant, nitride fuel, fast neutron spectrum core, pool vessel configuration, natural circulation, and containment meet or exceed the requirements for each level of protection. The report also includes recent results of a systematic analysis by LANL of data on corrosion of candidate cladding and structural material alloys of interest to SSTAR by LBE and Pb coolants; the data were taken from a new database on corrosion by liquid metal coolants created at LANL. The analysis methodology that considers penetration of an oxidation front into the alloy and dissolution of the trailing edge of the oxide into the coolant enables the long-term corrosion rate to be extracted from shorter-term corrosion data thereby enabling an evaluation of alloy performance over long core lifetimes (e. g., 30 years) that has heretofore not been possible. A number of candidate alloy specimens with special treatments or coatings which might enhance corrosion resistance at the temperatures at which SSTAR would operate were analyzed following testing in the DELTA loop at LANL including steels that were treated by laser peening at LLNL; laser peening is an approach that alters the oxide-metal bonds which could potentially improve corrosion resistance.

40|$|In {{order to}} fulfill the {{increasing}} worldwide electricity demand, renewable energy sources have long been considered as a very attractive solution. Besides the shortage in the conventional energy sources, rising impact of the global warming and the climate change create {{the need for an}} alternative electricity supply with the lowest possible greenhouse gas emissions. Among the other renewable energy sources, photovoltaic (PV) energy is argued {{to be one of the}} most promising future clean energy source for its no carbon emission, pollution free operation, low maintenance cost, lack of noise and easy installation. Therefore, the PV energy has been foreseen as a major contributor in the worldwide electricity generation in a near future. Since 2010, the more PV capacity has been installed worldwide than in the previous four decades. The high demand and the several benefits of the PV technology brings the motivation for further research to utilize the solar power more efficiently. The PV research nowadays emphasis on improvement of the system efficiency over a wide range of operating conditions with more cost-effective way than the existing system. By following the trend, this PhD dissertation looks into an efficient way of the PV power conversion by designing and developing the novel power converters to improve the energy yield of the entire PV system. This dissertation proposes high efficient, compact, cost-effective DC-DC converters for the distributed PV application. In the PV power generation, the power loss due to the partial shading is a well-known problem in the prior art. It causes power mismatches between the PV outputs and reduces the total energy yield. To address the power mismatch problem and the fluctuations of the PV output, distributed PV power generations are considered as a potential solution. The benefits of the distributed power generation and the different types of configurations of that are discussed in this thesis. Among different options, DC-DC micro-converters (or also known as DC optimizers) are selected for further research as it is one of the most promising solution. Since DC distribution networks are newly emerging technology in the PV market, DC-DC micro-converters are also useful to integrate in a DC distribution system. In this work, two DC micro-converters are proposed for targeting two different applications, one is mainly for a series-connected distributed system and another is for a parallel-connected system. Another topology of a micro-converter is proposed, which is beneficial in terms of its wide input, output voltage range. It will help to track the generated PV power in a wide operating range. In order to deal with the PV output variations and the power mismatch problems, this work proposes the design requirements of a DC-DC micro-converter for the distributed PV application. These proposed requirements can be used as a guideline for the developments of a PV converter. By considering that, a non-isolated multiplier boost topology has been selected. The detail selection procedure and the suitability of the topology for this specific application are explained in the following chapters. A 200 W high frequency non-isolated DC-DC converter is designed and built for the sub-module level power conversion, mainly for a series-connected system. Since it is a high frequency converter, few measures are taken into account during the development of the converter. The different steps from design to implementation are described in detail in the thesis. The measurement result of the converter performance, efficiency measurement results at <b>full</b> <b>power</b> <b>range</b> and the thermal measurement results are provided here. The converter is further tested with the high band gap gallium nitride (GaN) switches in order to investigate the efficiency improvement of the converter. Next to that, a wide input range, high gain, high efficiency non-isolated converter is developed to use as a module-integrated converter for the parallel-connected system. The converter is made to interface between a PV module and a DC bus as it can directly boost from the low PV voltage to a high DC bus voltage (360 V). The converter is further integrated in a real-time PV system set-up and tested under static and dynamic irradiance for the different operating conditions. Finally, a novel DC-DC converter’s topology is proposed for a wide input, output voltage range. Different novel ideas are proposed to increase the voltage gain range and the input-output voltage range of a non-isolated multiplier converter. This topology is applicable for any kind of fluctuating voltage sources. All the presented converters are proposed to facilitate the PV energy harvesting and to increase the overall energy yield of a PV system. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} test results of three NEXT ion engines are presented. These ion engines exhibited peak specific impulse and thrust efficiency ranges of 4060 4090 s and 0. 68 0. 69, respectively, at the <b>full</b> <b>power</b> {{point of the}} NEXT throttle table. The performance of the ion engines satisfied all project requirements. Beam flatness parameters were significantly improved over the NSTAR ion engine, {{which is expected to}} improve accelerator grid service life. The results of engine inlet pressure and temperature measurements are also presented. Maximum main plenum, cathode, and neutralizer pressures were 12, 000 Pa, 3110 Pa, and 8540 Pa, respectively, at the <b>full</b> <b>power</b> point of the NEXT throttle table. Main plenum and cathode inlet pressures required about 6 hours to increase to steady-state, while the neutralizer required only about 0. 5 hour. Steady-state engine operating temperature <b>ranges</b> throughout the <b>power</b> throttling <b>range</b> examined were 179 303 C for the discharge chamber magnet rings and 132 213 C for the ion optics mounting ring...|$|R
