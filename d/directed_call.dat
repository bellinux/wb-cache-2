40|$|The {{problem of}} {{establishing}} and completing a given set of calls {{as early as}} possible is studied for bidirectional and <b>directed</b> <b>calls</b> in various classes of networks. Even under the assumption of unit bandwidth requirements and unit call durations, call scheduling is NP–hard for trees with unbounded degree, for rings, and for meshes. Whereas bidirectional calls can be scheduled optimally in polynomial time for trees of constant degree, the problem for <b>directed</b> <b>calls</b> is already NP–hard for binary trees. Approximation algorithms with constant performance ratio are known for many NP–hard variants of call scheduling. ...|$|R

50|$|A {{large number}} of {{commercial}} and open-source VSTs are written using the Juce C++ framework instead of <b>direct</b> <b>calls</b> to the VST SDK, because this allows multi-format (VST, AudioUnit and Real Time AudioSuite) binaries to be built from a single codebase.|$|R
