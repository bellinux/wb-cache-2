25|$|Every {{polynomial}} in one variable x {{with real}} coefficients can be uniquely written {{as the product}} of a constant, polynomials of the form x+a with a real, and polynomials of the form x2+ax+b with a and b real and a2−4b<nbsp&0 (which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as saying that the polynomial x2nbsp&+nbsp&axnbsp&+nbsp&b has no real roots). This implies that the number of non-real complex roots (up to multiplicity) is always even.|$|E

25|$|A small {{category}} with {{a single}} object <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a monoid: the morphisms of a one-object category {{can be thought of}} as elements of the monoid, and composition in the category is thought of as the monoid operation. Functors between one-object categories correspond to monoid homomorphisms. So in a sense, functors between arbitrary categories are a kind of generalization of monoid homomorphisms to categories with more than one object.|$|E
25|$|Another {{application}} is in database theory, where a relational {{model of a}} database {{is essentially the same}} thing as a relational structure. It turns out that a conjunctive query on a database can be described by another structure in the same signature as the database model. A homomorphism from the relational model to the structure representing the query <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a solution to the query. This shows that the conjunctive query problem is also equivalent to the homomorphism problem.|$|E
25|$|As seen above, in the {{standard}} encoding of graphs as structures the induced substructures are precisely the induced subgraphs. However, a homomorphism between graphs <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a homomorphism between the two structures coding the graph. In {{the example of the}} previous section, even though the subgraph H of G is not induced, the identity map id:H→G is a homomorphism. This map is in fact a monomorphism in the category σ-Hom, and therefore H is a subobject of G which is not an induced substructure.|$|E

25|$|The {{difference}} between {{left and right}} actions is in {{the order in which}} a product like gh acts on x. For a left action h acts first and is followed by g, while for a right action g acts first and is followed by h. Because of the formula , one can construct a left action from a right action by composing with the inverse operation of the group. Also, a right action of a group G on X <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as a left action of its opposite group Gop on X. It is thus sufficient to only consider left actions without any loss of generality.|$|E
25|$|Kant opens section III by {{defining}} the will {{as the cause}} of our actions. According to Kant, having a will <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> <b>thing</b> as being rational, and having a free will means having a will that is not influenced by external forces. This is a negative definition of freedom – it tells us that freedom is freedom from determination by alien forces. But Kant also provides a positive definition of freedom: a free will, Kant argues, gives itself a law- it sets its own ends, and has a special causal power to bring them about. A free will is one that has the power to bring about its own actions {{in a way that is}} distinct from the way that normal laws of nature cause things to happen. According to Kant, we need laws to be able to act. An action not based on some sort of law would be arbitrary and not the sort of thing that we could call the result of willing. Because a free will is not merely pushed around by external forces, external forces do not provide laws for a free will. The only source of law for a free will is that will itself. This is Kant's notion of autonomy. Thus, Kant's notion of freedom of the will requires that we are morally self legislating, that we impose the moral law on ourselves. Kant thinks that the positive understanding of freedom amounts to the same thing as the categorical imperative, and that “a free will and a will under moral laws are one and the same”. This is the key notion that later scholars call the reciprocity thesis. The reciprocity thesis states that a will is bound by the moral law if and only if it is free. That means that if you know that someone is free, then you know that the moral law applies to them, and vice versa.|$|E
