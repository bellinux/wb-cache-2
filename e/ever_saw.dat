5|$|Here and there, {{there are}} some people who are supremely endowed. My memory goes back to Jim Thorpe. He never practiced in his life, and he could do {{anything}} better than any other football player I <b>ever</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{baseball}} field in Fresno named after Chance operated from 1935 to 1941. Joe DiMaggio {{played in the}} first-ever game at Frank Chance Field. Retired players participated in an exhibition game in Chance's honor in 1937. John McGraw, a contemporary and rival of Chance, considered Chance {{one of the greatest}} players he <b>ever</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E

Ser Arthur Dayne and Ser Gerold Hightower greet Eddard as he arrives. Bran remarks that Ser Arthur Dayne was the best swordsman his father <b>ever</b> <b>saw.</b>|$|E

5|$|He was {{the most}} amazing and ingenious combat pilot I <b>ever</b> <b>saw.</b> He was also very lucky on many occasions. He thought nothing of jumping into a fight outnumbered ten to one, often alone, with us {{trying to catch up}} to him. He {{violated}} every cardinal rule of fighter combat. He abandoned all the rules.|$|E
5|$|While heavily recruited, Campbell {{narrowed his}} choices to Houston, Oklahoma, Texas, Arkansas, and Baylor. After in-home visits from Barry Switzer from Oklahoma and Darrell Royal from Texas, Campbell {{ultimately}} chose Texas. Switzer, who unsuccessfully recruited Campbell, {{said in his}} 1989 book that Campbell was the only player he <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> who could have gone straight {{from high school to}} the NFL and immediately become a star.|$|E
5|$|In retirement, the Goodmans {{enjoyed a}} rich family life, visiting often with son Theodore ("Ted") {{and his wife}} Carol, and {{daughter}} Lydia Ann ("Ann") and son-in-law Bob. To his unabashed delight, Urner and Louise Goodman had nine grandchildren. Their son George was killed in action in France during World War II, however. Upon hearing the news in December 1944, Goodman was deeply grieved, and Louise, his wife of 60 years, {{said it was the}} only time she <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> him cry.|$|E

5|$|Like {{many people}} of his generation, Ochs deeply admired President John F. Kennedy, even though he {{disagreed}} {{with the president on}} issues such as the Bay of Pigs Invasion, the Cuban Missile Crisis, and the growing involvement of the United States in the Vietnamese civil war. When Kennedy was assassinated on November 22, 1963, Ochs wept. He told his wife that he {{thought he was going to}} die that night. It was the only time she <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> Ochs cry.|$|E
5|$|Smart's Hymns {{are one of}} {{the first}} works of hymns {{dedicated}} to children, and they are intended to teach Christian virtues. Unlike some of the other works produced by Smart after his release from a mental asylum, such as A Song to David or Hymns and Spiritual Songs, this work was a success and went into many immediate editions. Part of the success of this work lies in the simplicity and accessibility of the text. However, Smart died before he <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> the proceeds of the work and never learned of the book's success.|$|E
5|$|Specimens of B.menziesii {{were first}} {{collected}} by the botanist Charles Fraser during Captain (later Admiral Sir) James Stirling's March 1827 exploration of the Swan River. The following year, Alexander Macleay sent some of Fraser's specimens to Robert Brown. Brown formally published the species in his 1830 Supplementum Primum Prodromi Florae Novae Hollandiae, giving it the specific epithet in honor of Archibald Menzies, surgeon-naturalist on the HMS Discovery under George Vancouver, who discovered King George Sound in 1791. Thus the species' full name is Banksia menziesii R.Br. Neither Brown nor Menzies <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> the plant growing.|$|E

5|$|No. 77 Squadron {{returned}} to Williamtown in early 1969 to re-equip with Dassault MirageIII supersonic fighters, undertaking its initial flights on 7July. The Mirages {{were charged with}} interception, high- and low-angle bombing, close air support, and photo reconnaissance; their armament included 30mm cannon, Sidewinder missiles and conventional bombs. No.77 Squadron's prime role was ground attack, although none of the RAAF's Mirages <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> combat. No.481 Squadron was responsible for day-to-day servicing, {{as well as most}} heavy maintenance. No.77 Squadron suffered its first fatal Mirage accident on 3April 1973, when an aircraft crashed during a training flight at low altitude. Another pilot was killed when his Mirage hit the water during formation flying at night on 24June 1976.|$|E
5|$|After missing {{most of the}} 193435 {{domestic}} season due to injury, McCabe scored an unbeaten 189 in the Second Test of the 193536 tour of South Africa, {{including a}} century in one session, taking Australia {{to the brink of}} a world record-breaking victory on a difficult final-day pitch in poor light before the match was called off. It was one of two Test centuries McCabe made on the tour. The following season, he made five fifties in the first four Tests before scoring a century to help Australia win the deciding final Test against the touring Englishmen. In the First Test of the 1938 tour of England, McCabe played what was regarded as his greatest innings, scoring 232 in four hours, including his last 72 in 28 minutes. Bradman regarded the innings as the greatest batting he <b>ever</b> <b>saw.</b> However, none of McCabe’s three most famous innings resulted in an Australian victory; he has a reputation of being at his best when Australia was in difficulty.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1941, {{officials}} in the War Office and the British Army had taken the decision that light tanks were no longer {{to be used by}} the British Army due to their inferior weapons and armour, as well as their poor performance during the conflict. Consequently, the Mk VIII was obsolete by the time that any significant number of the tanks had been produced, and none <b>ever</b> <b>saw</b> combat. A number of plans were made by the War Office for the design in light of this decision, including equipping reconnaissance units with them, or the unsuccessful idea of attaching wings to them so that aircraft could tow them as gliders into position to support airborne forces; eventually it was decided to hand over those tanks that had been built to the Royal Air Force for use in airfield defence. One variant on the Mk VIII was designed, the Alecto self-propelled gun which was to have mounted a howitzer and used as a close-support vehicle by airborne forces; however only a few were ever produced and they were never used in combat.|$|E

5|$|The {{island is}} ruled {{over by a}} king. His name is Epatiana. He is a large, ignorant-looking boy of about 18 summers, {{and is one of}} the worst rowdies on the island, and there is no power to touch him. The first time we met him he was just landing from an {{excursion}} trip to the island of Rimatara, near by. And you need not be told that I was surprised when told that he was the king of the island; for instead of being dressed in a garb of rich apparel of some kind, with a crown about his head, as I had expected, he had nothing whatever on to indicate his supreme power. His costume was composed of a red breech-clout, a red woolen shirt and upon his bare head an old dried up wreath of faded flowers, such as is worn by all rowdies. When we spoke to him about his island, he dropped his head, as he sat upon the sand, and blushingly answered us. We told him who we were and where we were from, saluted him and left him with very different ideas formed about the king of Rurutu, than we had before meeting him. This was the first monarch of the kind I <b>ever</b> <b>saw,</b> and the first time we were ever under the reign of a king. The island is under the French protection, still it regulates and governs its own affairs, and the French have nothing to say in that respect. The king has judges under him, who make the laws and enforce them while he is in his childhood days.|$|E
