500|$|In September 1984, Jack Slee's mother Alfrieda Slee filed a {{wrongful}} death lawsuit {{in federal court}} for $5 million against Erhard and [...] WE Causes of action brought in the complaint included negligence, intentional infliction of emotional distress, <b>implied</b> <b>warranty,</b> express warranty, fraud, strict liability and unfair trade practices. The suit asserted that mental stress from the est training resulted {{in the death of}} her son. Erhard's company (WE), as well as est trainer Steve Zafflin were named in the suit. The suit stated that Slee had been [...] "subjected to psychological pressures, group pressures ... mind control techniques which caused him to lose his ordinary psychological defenses, emotional confrontations which caused him to become emotionally distraught and which led to physical reactions resulting in his death".|$|E
2500|$|Besides his {{personal}} injury cases, which earned for him his byname [...] "King of Torts," [...] Belli {{was instrumental in}} setting {{up some of the}} foundations of modern consumer rights law, arguing several cases in the 1940s and 1950s that formed the basis for later lawsuits and landmark litigation by such figures as Ralph Nader. Belli argued (in cases such as Escola v. Coca-Cola Bottling Co., in 1944, which arose from an incident in which a restaurant manager from Merced, California was injured by an exploding Coca-Cola bottle) that all products have an <b>implied</b> <b>warranty,</b> that it is to be foreseen that products will be used by a long chain of people, not just the direct recipient of the manufactured product, and that negligence by a defendant need not be proven if the defendant's product is defective.|$|E

5000|$|Sellers of {{consumer}} products who make service contracts on their products are prohibited under the Act from disclaiming or limiting <b>implied</b> <b>warranties.</b> [...] (Remember also that sellers who extend written warranties on consumer products cannot disclaim <b>implied</b> <b>warranties,</b> {{regardless of whether}} they make service contracts on their products.)

5000|$|In the United States, various laws apply, {{including}} {{provisions in}} the Uniform Commercial Code which provide for <b>implied</b> <b>warranties.</b> However, these <b>implied</b> <b>warranties</b> were often limited by disclaimers. In 1975 the Magnuson-Moss Warranty Act was passed to strengthen warranties on consumer goods. Among other things, under the law <b>implied</b> <b>warranties</b> cannot be disclaimed if an express warranty is offered, and attorney fees may be recovered. In some states statutory warranties are required on new home construction, and [...] "lemon laws" [...] apply to motor vehicles.|$|R
50|$|In {{common law}} jurisdictions, an <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> is a {{contract}} law term for certain assurances that are {{presumed to be}} made in the sale of products or real property, due to the circumstances of the sale. These assurances are characterized as warranties irrespective of whether the seller has expressly promised them orally or in writing. They include an <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of fitness for a particular purpose, an <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of merchantability for products, <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of workmanlike quality for services, and an <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of habitability for a home.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Implied</b> <b>{{warranty}}</b> {{of fitness}}—Implied {{warranty of fitness}} arises when the seller knows the buyer is relying upon the seller's expertise in choosing goods. <b>Implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of merchantability: every sale of goods fit for ordinary purposes. Express warranties: arise from any statement of fact of promise.|$|E
5000|$|If the {{merchandise}} is sold with an express [...] "guarantee", {{the terms of}} the <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of merchantability will fill the gaps left by that guarantee. If {{the terms of the}} express guarantee are not specified, they will be considered to be the terms of the <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of merchantability. The UCC allows sellers to disclaim the <b>implied</b> <b>warranty</b> of merchantability, provided the disclaimer is made conspicuously and the disclaimer explicitly uses the term [...] "merchantability" [...] in the disclaimer. [...] Some states, however, have implemented the UCC such that this can not be disclaimed.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A set of {{institutions}} to protect consumer´s rights take {{a central role}} to reduce transaction costs contributing to economic efficiency and social equity. Unfortunately, consumer protection is still poor and weak in most developing countries. In this paper we focus on a particular institution of Consumer Law, <b>implied</b> <b>warranties,</b> current in most Latin American legal system. We develop a model to assess the economic consequences of introducing mandatory and uniformly <b>implied</b> <b>warranties</b> and their effects concerning to the moral hazard problem. Two main aspects will be crucial in order to design <b>implied</b> <b>warranties</b> efficiently: first, to determine the operative conditions to trigger warranties; second, to identify the empirical context in which <b>implied</b> <b>warranties</b> should applied. Then, certain topics related to institutional design and empirical constraints that may arise, especially in Latin American, are discussed...|$|R
