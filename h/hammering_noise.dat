5000|$|Steam {{distribution}} {{systems may}} also be vulnerable to a situation similar to water hammer, known as steam hammer. In a steam system, a water hammer most often occurs {{when some of the}} steam condenses into water in a horizontal section of the piping. Steam picks up the water, forming a [...] "slug", and hurls this at high velocity into a pipe fitting, creating a loud <b>hammering</b> <b>noise</b> and greatly stressing the pipe. This condition is usually caused by a poor condensate drainage strategy.|$|E
50|$|When a pipe is {{suddenly}} closed at the outlet (downstream), {{the mass of}} water before the closure is still moving, thereby building up high pressure and a resulting shock wave. In domestic plumbing this is experienced as a loud banging resembling a <b>hammering</b> <b>noise.</b> Water hammer can cause pipelines to break if the pressure is high enough. Air traps or stand pipes (open at the top) are sometimes added as dampers to water systems to absorb the potentially damaging forces caused by the moving water.|$|E

40|$|The {{technical}} {{environment of}} a radiology department can cause anxiety for a child. The big machine, the narrow, hard bed, confined space, <b>hammering</b> <b>noises,</b> flashing lights, {{the sight of}} the needle for contrast injection may seem horrible. It requires knowledge of the child's characteristics, nursing skills and extra time for preparation for a radiology nurse to perform a successful examination. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine children's experiences in a radiology department and the non-pharmacologic methods used in a radiology examination. Two questions were used to achieve this: How do children experience an X-ray examination? What are the non-pharmacological methods that could help to succeed in the examination of children in the radiology department? The study was conducted as a systematic literature review using six of Goodman's seven steps and the current research were sought in three databases and by manual search. Fifteen articles were sorted by seeking and sonsolidating their similarities and differences. The results show that children experience feelings of worry, anxiety and fear in different intensities in different stages of a procedure.

40|$|LTDS and VIBRATEC {{founded the}} Labcom LADAGE (gears {{dynamics}} joint laboratory). One of its {{goals is to}} develop numerical methods and simulation tools for predicting gears dynamics, {{in order to take}} account of multiphysics couplings between internal and external excitations and to follow the evolution of industrial demand towards more and more complex systems. The operation of a combustion engine is such that it generates a cyclic disturbance of the circular motion of the gearbox primary shaft. Coupled with internal excitations, this disturbance can generate losses of contact at the loaded gear pair. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox <b>hammering</b> <b>noise.</b> The irregular rotation of the motor is also sufficient for generating loss of contact of unloaded gears, such as idler gears of an automotive gearbox. Corresponding vibroimpacts regimes are responsible of the gearbox rattle noise. Two different approaches can be retained to describe the nonlinear dynamic behaviour of mechanisms with contact and backlash nonlinearities, depending on the intensity of the vibroimpact pulses and contact duration. <b>Hammering</b> <b>noise</b> For high level pulses, the contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is long. A nonlinear dynamic model is introduced, taking into account both the gear backlash and the contact stiffness nonlinearities. Solving the equations of motion requires the implementation of specific methods dedicated to nonlinear problems. For example, the finite difference method is used in order to obtain the periodic solutions. They are followed up according to a parameter control, thanks to a pseudoarc length continuation method. Indeed, this approach has proven very efficient for studying multifrequency excitations. A direct integration time method is also used in order to compare obtained results. Eigenvalues of the monodromy matrix inform us about their loss of local stability and {{about the nature of the}} bifurcations that occur. This first approach is well suited to characterize the <b>hammering</b> <b>noise</b> of a truck timing multistage gear. A large variety of dynamic behaviours have been identified. In addition to periodic responses, pseudoperiodic and chaotic ones are highlighted. Multiple impacts per period of excitation are observed. These nonlinear responses occur at resonances and instability regions. Then, the adding effect of the engine torque fluctuation is considered. The dynamic behaviour of the two-stage gear train becomes more complex. Vibroimpact regimes are observed over a wide range of operating conditions. Rattle noise A second approach is retained for low level pulses. The contact duration of successive vibroimpacts is very short. They are described in a more simple way, using a coefficient of restitution. The dynamic response of the system is built piecewisely by solving the equations of motion for the free flight periods. New initial conditions are introduced after each impact, derived from the dynamic response just before impact. This second approach is particularly well suited to characterize the rattle noise due to nonlinear dynamic behaviour of idle gears of an automotive gearbox. In addition to the gearbox design parameters and the engine operating conditions, the dynamic response of idle gears depends on the drag torque applied to the idle gear and the coefficient of restitution. They are identified experimentally through implementation of optical encoders in an actual automotive gearbox and the operation of a specific test bench which replicates the automotive power train. Models of the different drag torque sources are validated from analysis of the free damped response of the drivelines. The coefficient of restitution and its probability density function are measured from further experiments under stationary operating conditions. A nonlinear model of the dynamic response of idle gears is built. The key parameters are the dimensionless backlash, the coefficient of restitution and a dimensionless parameter proposed to describe the rattle excitation level. Periodic, pseudoperiodic and chaotic responses including impacts between active flanks and reverse flanks are observed. Experiments under controlled excitation are performed to validate the assumptions, to confirm the ability of the proposed parameter to describe the rattle noise threshold, and to characterize the dynamic behaviour of the idle gear. Predictions are fitted with the drag torque and coefficient of restitution previously identified. Comparisons with measurements demonstrate the ability of the model to predict gear rattle for any idle gear, any gearbox and any operating condition...|$|E
40|$|When bending {{sharp and}} Jagged edges of {{materials}} and riveting different components of the cars structures, pneumatic <b>hammers</b> generate <b>noise</b> and vibration. The severity of the noise as a potential operator hazard {{should be considered in}} light of the following data. The noise produced by the six studied <b>hammers</b> is impact <b>noise</b> with more than 20 impulses per second. The average peak pressure level is 131. 9 dB with the standard deviation of 2. 1 dB. The equivalent level during a shift work, 8 hours per day, is 114 dB. Hand-arm vibration has also been measured in each applicable direction (x,y,z). The Z direction is the principal direction that vibration enters the hand. The average effective acceleration is 23. 5 m/s 2 and the standard deviation is 15. 2 m/s 2. The total exposure time during a shift is about 6 - 30 minutes which intermittently included 30 - 60 seconds.

The seismic data measured in the local site includes various sensing noises (offset or measurement noise) and man-made/natural noises (road and rail traffic <b>noise,</b> rotating or <b>hammering</b> machinery <b>noise,</b> human activity noise such as walking and running, wind/atmospheric pressure-generated noise, etc.). These additive noises are different in time and frequency characters. The proposed method uses 3 -stages processing to reduce these different additive noises. In the first stage, misalignment offset noise are diminished by time average processing, and then the second and third stages, coherent/incoherent noises such as man-made/natural noises are suppressed by array stacking. In addition, we derived the theoretical equation of the SNR gain improved by the proposed method.

40|$|A steel {{monopile}} is {{the most}} common foundation type of a wind turbine installed offshore and is driven into place with the help of vibratory or impact <b>hammers.</b> Underwater <b>noise</b> generated during the installation of steel monopiles has recently received considerable attention from international environmental organizations and regulatory bodies in various nations. Collected data regarding underwater noise measurements indicate that pile driving operations, especially when impact hammers are used, can be potentially harmful for the marine ecosystem. In this paper, a linear semi-analytical model is developed {{for the study of the}} vibroacoustic behaviour of a coupled pile-soil-water system. The hammer is substituted by an external force applied at the head of the pile. The pile is described by a thin shell theory, whereas both soil and water are modelled as threedimensional continua. The solution is based on the dynamic sub-structuring technique. The total system is divided into two subsystems namely, the shell structure and the soil-fluid medium. The response of each sub-domain is expressed as a summation over a complete set of eigenfunctions. The orthogonality of the shell modes in vacuo and the bi-orthogonality of the acoustoelastic modes is utilized in order to meet the displacement compatibility and the force equilibrium at the interface of the two sub-systems. With the developed model, the wave radiation due to vibratory and impact pile driving is analysed. The influence of soil elasticity and soil stratification on the dynamics of the coupled system is examined. In addition, the energy launched by the hammer into the water and into the soil is investigated for both excitation types in order to highlight the main differences in the generated wave field.

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 24 February 1944 Tally-Ho was ordered back to the Sembilan Islands, and while zig-zagging on the surface at night {{charging}} the batteries, lookouts spotted two wakes ahead. Believing {{there was a possibility}} of the two vessels being friendly (both [...] and [...] being in the area), Tally-Ho immediately altered course to avoid a collision with the rapidly approaching vessels. On making a challenge with the Aldis lamp the vessels responded by altering course straight towards them and dropping depth charges, leaving no doubt they were unfriendly vessels. At this point the closest ship fired a shell which passed dangerously close over Tally-Hos conning tower before the attacker passed closely by the submarine and then turned for another attack. During this encounter Tally-Ho had been unable to dive due to the proximity of the attackers and the shallowness of the waters in the straight, in addition, diving would have presented the attacking ships with the opportunity to ram or depth charge the submarine. In the darkness Tally-Ho manoeuvred to a parallel course to the approaching attacker and the enemy vessel passed closely by the submarine, a loud <b>hammering</b> and tearing <b>noise</b> being heard as the ship passed, the vessel being identified as a Hayabusa-class torpedo boat of 600 tons. As the attacker disappeared in the murk Tally-Ho took on a list to port and assumed a marked bow-down attitude. Bennington decided that the batteries would have sufficient charge to risk diving which Tally-Ho then did. Before closing the conning tower hatch, he noticed that the submarine had taken on a 12-degree list. Once submerged, the crew took stock of the damage, and apart from smashed light bulbs and gauge dial glasses, Tally-Ho appeared to be seaworthy, and she remained submerged until 06:30 of 24 February when Bennington brought Tally-Ho to periscope depth and observed his attacker making unusual manoeuvres apparently searching for the submarine on the starboard quarter some 4 mi off. Tally-Ho remained dived for the following 12 hours before surfacing after dark at 18:25. Upon surfacing it was noticed that the submarine's list had increased to 15 degrees, and it was possible to see the damage to the submarine's port ballast tanks which were all open at the top and beyond further use. With transfer of fuel and water from various tanks and moving of stores and torpedoes, the bow-down attitude was reduced to 4 degrees, and the three-day journey to Trincomalee commenced. This was uneventful apart from encountering a monsoon during the passage of the Bay of Bengal and the possibility of encountering a Japanese submarine close to home. Arriving at Trincomalee harbour on 29 February 1944, Tally-Ho missed her escort and found herself amongst Admiral James Sommerville's battle fleet at exercises. Later, upon examination in dry dock prior to repairs, the extent of the damage to Tally-Hos port ballast tanks became apparent. The rotating screws of the torpedo boat had run the length of the tanks, chewing large holes in them, phosphor bronze fragments of the attacker's propeller blades being discovered inside. Post-war enquiries learned that their attacker's behaviour after the attack had been due to a combination of Tally-Hos lowered port bow hydroplane having pierced the torpedo boat's hull, and the vessel's port screw having been shorn of its blades almost down to the hub.|$|R
