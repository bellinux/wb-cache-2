5|$|A {{wide variety}} of weather can be found along an {{occluded}} front, with thunderstorms possible, but usually their passage {{is associated with a}} drying of the air mass. Within the occlusion of the front, a circulation of air brings warm air upward and sends drafts of cold air downward, or vice versa depending on the occlusion the front <b>is</b> <b>experiencing.</b> Precipitations and clouds are associated with the trowal, the projection on the Earth's surface of the tongue of warm air aloft formed during the occlusion process of the depression.|$|E
5|$|Grouped into cooperatives, women play {{a leading}} role in the island's economy. Notably through microcredit, they engage in fishing-related activities, such as smoking fish and {{processing}} shrimp, oysters, and shellfish in general. As there is no industrial activity on the island (the closest such activity is in Ziguinchor), the island <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> a rural exodus of young people. They return to help their parents in the rice fields and participate in religious ceremonies during the dry season, but they tend to settle off the island permanently.|$|E

5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency. In the most basic sense, this <b>is</b> the <b>experience</b> of the other's body and, in this sense, it <b>is</b> an <b>experience</b> of [...] "my body over there". In most other respects, however, the <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> modified so that what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> as being the other's experience; in <b>experiencing</b> empathy, what <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> <b>is</b> not [...] "my" [...] experience, even though I <b>experience</b> it. Empathy <b>is</b> also {{considered to be the}} condition of intersubjectivity and, as such, the source of the constitution of objectivity.|$|R

Black arrives in the isolated town of Bucksnort, and visits a local diner. Standing out amongst the residents is Michael Beebe (Randy Stone), who has moved there from Los Angeles. Beebe believes his elderly neighbour may be responsible for the attack and asks Black to investigate.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of {{the effects}} of the cosmic {{microwave}} background radiation on the dynamics of distant astrophysical systems in 2000 proved the Copernican principle, that, on a cosmological scale, the Earth is not in a central position. Radiation from the Big Bang was demonstrably warmer at earlier times throughout the universe. Uniform cooling of the CMB over billions of years is explainable only if the universe <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> a metric expansion, and excludes the possibility that we are near the unique center of an explosion.|$|E
30|$|For {{the second}} experiment, having already {{established}} that OT {{can serve as}} a reliable online proxy in healthy participants, we focused more directly on the categorical denials that disownership experiences occur. This time participants were advised as regards the phenomena under investigation and instructed to indicate OT for both ownership and disownership experiences. Again, ownership and disownership <b>were</b> <b>experienced</b> more quickly when stroking was synchronous than when it was not, and the more quickly ownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced</b> the more quickly disownership <b>was</b> <b>experienced.</b> Furthermore, rapidity of onset for both correlated with the experienced strength of the illusions. Thus, consistent with our conjecture, it seems that for standard versions of the RHI ownership and disownership might be intrinsically related: the degree to which ownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the rubber hand, disownership <b>is</b> <b>experienced</b> for the biological hand. When the OT and the questionnaire data were conjoined, they augmented support for the view that disownership experiences do occur.|$|R

5|$|Philosophical behaviorism {{has fallen}} out of favor since {{the latter half of}} the 20th century, coinciding with the rise of cognitivism. Cognitivists reject behaviorism due to several {{perceived}} problems.

5|$|Solar {{urticaria}} can {{be difficult}} to diagnose, but its presence can be confirmed by the process of phototesting. There are several forms of these tests including photopatch tests, phototests, photoprovocation tests, and laboratory tests. All of these are necessary to determine the exact infliction that the patient is suffering from. Photopatch tests are patch tests conducted when it is believed that a patient <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> certain symptoms due to an allergy that will only occur when in contact with sunlight. After the procedure, the patient is given a low dosage of UVA radiation.|$|E
5|$|The ceasefire of 2004 brought {{relative}} peace, {{but in the}} meantime, {{the sinking}} of the Joola in 2002 claimed the lives of many inhabitants of Carabane and curtailed much of its ability to engage in trade and accept tourists for several years.

5|$|The rate of star {{formation}} in the Milky Way is much higher, with Andromeda Galaxy producing only about one solar mass per year compared to 3â€“5 solar masses for the Milky Way. The rate of supernovae in the Milky Way is also double that of Andromeda Galaxy. This suggests that the latter once experienced a great {{star formation}} phase, but {{is now in a}} relative state of quiescence, whereas the Milky Way <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> more active star formation. Should this continue, the luminosity in the Milky Way may eventually overtake that of Andromeda Galaxy.|$|E
5|$|Two hazards {{are uniquely}} {{identified}} with the dam. One is that sedimentation projections are not agreed upon, {{and the other is}} that the dam sits on a seismic fault. At current levels, 80% of the land in the area <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> erosion, depositing about 40million tons of sediment into the Yangtze annually. Because the flow is slower above the dam, much of this sediment will now settle there instead of flowing downstream, and there will be less sediment downstream.|$|E

Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a genetic disease which <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> an accelerated rate of mutation.

5|$|Filipino and English are the {{official}} languages of the country. Filipino is a standardized version of Tagalog, spoken mainly in Metro Manila and other urban regions.

The Philippine constitution provides {{for the promotion of}} Spanish and Arabic on a voluntary and optional basis, although neither are used on as wide a scale as in the past. Spanish, which was widely used as a lingua franca in the late nineteenth century, has since declined greatly in use, but <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> revival due to government promotions, while Arabic is mainly used in Islamic schools in Mindanao. However, Spanish loanwords are still present today in many of the indigenous Philippine languages.|$|E
5|$|Frame Analysis: An Essay on the Organization of Experience (1974) is Goffman's {{attempt to}} explain how {{conceptual}} frames â€“ ways to organize experience â€“ structure an individual's perception of society. This book is thus about the organization of experience rather than the organization of society. A frame {{is a set of}} concepts and theoretical perspectives that organize experiences and guide the actions of individuals, groups and societies. Frame analysis, then, is the study of the organization of social experience. To illustrate the concept of the frame, Goffman gives the example of a picture frame: a person uses the frame (which represents structure) to hold together his picture (which represents the content) of what he <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> in his life.|$|E

Some estimates put the number of visitors spending at least one night as high as 750,000 a year, most of them Danes from other regions, the remainder coming mainly from Norway, Sweden, northern Germany and the United Kingdom. Overall, they spend about DKK 3billion ($540million) in the city each year.

5|$|More global {{behavioural}} abnormalities may be noted, {{such as an}} increase in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor agitation or hyperactivity) which might reflect mania or delirium. An inability to sit still might represent akathisia, {{a side effect of}} antipsychotic medication. Similarly, a global decrease in arousal and movement (described as psychomotor retardation, akinesia or stupor) might indicate depression or a medical condition such as Parkinson's disease, dementia or delirium. The examiner would also comment on eye movements (repeatedly glancing to one side can suggest that the patient <b>is</b> <b>experiencing</b> hallucinations), and the quality of eye contact (which can provide clues to the patient's emotional state). Lack of eye contact may suggest depression or autism.|$|E

Infrastructure services and retail trades were also major industries. About 425 private firms employed a total of 3,332 workers in local industries including manufacturing, retail and infrastructure, at this time. Located within Greater Omak, the adjacent city of Okanogan serves as the administrative center for Okanogan County, the region's largest employer.|$|E
