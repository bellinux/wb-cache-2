40|$|The {{speech of}} older adults is {{commonly}} described as verbose and off-topic, which is thought to influence their social communication. This study investigated the role <b>of</b> <b>inhibition</b> in age-related off-topic verbosity (OTV). <b>Inhibition</b> consists <b>of</b> three functions: access, deletion, and restraint. The access function is responsible for preventing irrelevant information from accessing the attention center (pre-mechanism of inhibition); The deletion function is responsible for deleting previously relevant but currently irrelevant information from working memory, and the restraint function is responsible for restraining strong but inappropriate responses (post-mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>inhibition).</b> A referential communication task {{was used to determine}} whether OTV was influenced by the pre-mechanism <b>of</b> <b>inhibition.</b> A self-involved event interview task was used to investigate the effect of the post-mechanisms <b>of</b> <b>inhibition</b> on OTV.

5|$|Many natural poisons act as {{neurotoxins}} {{that can}} cause paralysis leading to death and have functions for defence against predators or in hunting and capturing prey. Some of these natural inhibitors, despite their toxic attributes, are valuable for therapeutic uses at lower doses. An example of a neurotoxin are the glycoalkaloids, from the plant species in the Solanaceae family (includes potato, tomato and eggplant), that are acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. <b>Inhibition</b> <b>of</b> this enzyme causes an uncontrolled increase in the acetylcholine neurotransmitter, muscular paralysis and then death. Neurotoxicity can also result from the <b>inhibition</b> <b>of</b> receptors; for example, atropine from deadly nightshade (Atropa belladonna) that functions as a competitive antagonist of the muscarinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
