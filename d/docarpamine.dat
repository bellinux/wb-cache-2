40|$|In the periphery, {{physiological}} dopamine increases renal blood flow, decreases renal {{resistance and}} acts on the kidney tubule to enhance natriuresis and diuresis. The loss of dopamine function may be involoved in the deterioration in kidney function associated with ageing {{and may have}} a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension and diabetes. Intravenous dopamine is used as a positive inotrope in the treatment of acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock and as a diuretic in renal failure. The clinical uses of dopamine are limited, as it must be given intravenously, and also has widespread effects. The levels of peripheral dopamine can be increased by the administration of L-dopa to increase synthesis, prodrugs to release dopamine (<b>docarpamine,</b> glu-dopa) or by inhibiting the breakdown of dopamine (nitecapone). Preliminary clinical trials suggest that <b>docarpamine</b> may be useful in patients with low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery and in refractory cirrhotic ascites. Ibopamine is an agonist at dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors, which may retard the progression of chronic renal failure. Gludopa is selective for the kidney thus avoiding widespread side effects. The early clinical studies with ibopamine as a diuretic in heart failure were favourable but the subsequent large mortality study showed that ibopamine increased mortality. Fenoldopam is a selective dopamine D 1 receptor agonist. Intravenous fenoldopam may be useful in the treatment of hypertension associated with coronary artery bypass surgery or in hypertensive emergencies. Although our understanding of physiological and pathological roles of peripheral dopamine has been increasing rapidly in recent times, we still need more information to allow the design of clinically useful drugs that modify these roles. One priority is an orally-active selective dopamine D 1 receptor agonist...|$|E
