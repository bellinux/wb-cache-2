40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{contribute}} to the development of the joining technique of Cf/SiC, joining of SiC ceramic to high strength graphite was investigated. This joining has been successfully realized by reaction joining process using a preceramic polymer, polysiloxane, mixed with the active additive Al-Si powder as <b>joining</b> <b>material.</b> The weld strength is strongly affected by the technological parameters and the ingredient ratio (polysiloxane:Al-Si powder).

The joint quality was determined by microstructural and microchemical analyses (TEM, AEM) and by fracture shear tests for comparative evaluations.

40|$|Abstract. Carbon fibre {{reinforced}} SiC (Cf /SiC) as {{a promising}} high temperature structural material possesses broad prospects for aeronautical and astronautical applications. Joining technique {{is very important}} from both technical and economical points of view. Joining of Cf/SiC to itself has been realized by reaction joining process using a preceramic polymer, polysilazane, as <b>joining</b> <b>material</b> (welding compound). The weld strength of joints is strongly affected by joining temperature and number of times of reinforcement, which comprises infiltration and pyrolysis of polysilazane. Samples were joined at temperatures ranging from 1100 oC- 1400 oC. The maximum weld strength of joints is obtained at 1250 oC. The reinforcement can remarkably increase the weld strength of joints. After three times of reinforcement the shearing strength of joints reaches 27. 78 MPa. Microstructural study and phase analysis reveal that the <b>joining</b> <b>material</b> has transformed into an amorphous ceramic interlayer composed of Si, C and N at 1100 ~ 1250 oC, which is uniform and densified. The thickness of the interlayer is 2 - 3 µm. The contact at the interfaces is good without obvious cracks and pores.

The nonlinear flow curves obtained from the viscosity tests revealed the “shear-thinning” behavior of solder paste samples. Thixotropic loop test results explain the time-dependent structural breakdown and recovery of solder pastes. The viscoelastic properties of solder pastes were interpreted through oscillatory test parameters: storage modulus (G′), loss modulus (G″), and phase angle (δ).
