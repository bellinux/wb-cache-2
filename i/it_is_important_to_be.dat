25|$|In the La Tene II, or La Tene C era (2nd century BC), {{the foot}} of the fibula {{actually}} bent back to touch the bow and was wrapped around it. Many La Tene II fibulae had long bilateral springs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware that this type of construction was in use several centuries later in the tied-foot and returned-foot types of fibulae.

25|$|When using {{biomarkers}} as a {{proxy for}} reconstructing ancient environments, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> aware of the biases inherent in the sedimentary record. Leaf matter incorporated into sediment is largely deposited during the autumn, so seasonal variations in leaf waxes must be considered accordingly. Furthermore, sediments average leaf waxes over lots of different plants in both space and time, making it difficult to calibrate the biological constraints on εl/w. Finally, preservation of biomolecules in the geologic record does not faithfully represent whole ecosystems, and there is always the threat of hydrogen exchange, particularly if the sediments are subjected to high temperatures.|$|E
25|$|Job {{performance}} represents behaviors employees {{engage in}} while at work which contribute to organizational goals. These behaviors are formally evaluated by an organization {{as part of}} an employee's responsibilities. In order to understand and ultimately predict job performance, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> precise when defining the term. Job performance is about behaviors that are within the control of the employee and not about results (effectiveness), the costs involved in achieving results (productivity), the results that can be achieved in a period of time (efficiency), or the value an organization places on a given level of performance, effectiveness, productivity or efficiency (utility).|$|E

25|$|Emergency {{bleeding}} control describes {{actions that}} control bleeding {{from a patient}} who has suffered a traumatic injury or who has a medical condition that has caused bleeding. Many bleeding control techniques are taught as part of first aid throughout the world, though some more advanced techniques such as tourniquets, are often taught as being reserved for use by health professionals, or as an absolute last resort, to mitigate associated risks, such as potential loss of limbs. To manage bleeding effectively, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to readily identify types of wounds and types of bleeding.|$|E
25|$|GIS {{offers a}} {{superior}} method for landslide analysis {{because it allows}} one to capture, store, manipulate, analyze, and display large amounts of data quickly and effectively. Because so many variables are involved, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to overlay the many layers of data to develop a full and accurate portrayal of what is taking place on the Earth's surface. Researchers need to know which variables {{are the most important}} factors that trigger landslides in any given location. Using GIS, extremely detailed maps can be generated to show past events and likely future events which have the potential to save lives, property, and money.|$|E
25|$|For {{the purpose}} of setting {{treatment}} standards and reuse legislation, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to {{determine the amount of}} helminth eggs in an environmental sample with some accuracy. The detection of viable helminth eggs in samples of wastewater, sludge or fresh feces (as a diagnostic tool for the infection helminthiasis) is not straight forward. In fact, many laboratories in developing countries lack the right equipment or skilled staff required to do so. An important step in the analytical methods is usually the concentration of the eggs in the sample, {{especially in the case of}} wastewater samples. A concentration step may not be required in samples of dried feces, e.g. samples collected from urine-diverting dry toilets.|$|E

25|$|While DNA is most {{important}} for information storage, a large fraction of the cell's activities are carried out by proteins. Therefore, {{it is important to}} have tools to send proteins to specific regions of the cell and to link different proteins together, as desired. Ideally the interaction strength between protein partners should be tunable between a lifetime of seconds (desirable for dynamic signaling events) up to an irreversible interaction (desirable when building devices stable over days or resilient to harsh conditions). Interactions such as coiled coils, SH3 domain-peptide binding or SpyTag/SpyCatcher have helped to give such control. In addition <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to regulate protein-protein interactions in cells, such as with light (using Light-oxygen-voltage-sensing domains) or cell-permeable small molecules by Chemically induced dimerization.|$|E
25|$|Diagnosis of food {{intolerance}} can include hydrogen breath testing for lactose intolerance and fructose malabsorption, professionally supervised elimination diets, and ELISA testing for IgG-mediated immune responses to specific foods. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> {{able to distinguish}} between food allergy, {{food intolerance}}, and autoimmune disease {{in the management of}} these disorders. Non-IgE-mediated intolerance is more chronic, less acute, less obvious in its clinical presentation, and often more difficult to diagnose than allergy, as skin tests and standard immunological studies are not helpful. Elimination diets must remove all poorly tolerated foods, or all foods containing offending compounds. Clinical investigation is generally undertaken only for more serious cases, as for minor complaints which do not significantly limit the person's lifestyle the cure may be more inconvenient than the problem.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} detect carbon dioxide leaks and the {{effectiveness}} of geological sequestration sites, different monitoring techniques can be employed to verify that the sequestered carbon stays trapped below the surface in the intended reservoir. Leakage due to injection at improper locations or conditions could result in carbon dioxide being released back into the atmosphere. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to detect leaks with enough warning {{to put a stop to}} it, and to be able to quantify the amount of carbon that has leaked for purposes such as cap and trade policies, evaluation of environmental impact of leaked carbon, as well as accounting for the total loss and cost of the process. To quantify the amount of carbon dioxide released, should a leak occur, or to closely watch stored , there are several monitoring methods that can be done at both the surface and subsurface levels.|$|E

30|$|Finally, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> {{consider}} how exemplar study findings can be generalized. Findings reveal {{the leading edge}} of development, but what does this tell us about more typical development of the construct? Correlational exemplar studies predict the experiences and characteristics that are likely to accompany the construct of interest, but we cannot claim that these experiences and characteristics cause exemplarity. Furthermore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bear in mind that while the exemplars are highly developed in one particular area, they are not necessarily highly developed in others, so <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> bracket findings to the construct of interest.|$|R

25|$|Dr. Wolowelsky {{wrote that}} {{although}} the Talmud appears to have an iron-clad rule that a Kohen should always be called to the Torah first and early practice gave precedence to Torah scholars, the Magen Avraham proposed the then-novel idea that individuals observing special occasions, such as a wedding or Bar Mitzvah, should have precedence. The Magen Avraham's view eventually prevailed, and subsequent commentators, including Rabbi Ovadiah Yosef, developed his ideas {{to the point of}} creating various exceptions under which a Yisrael observing a special occasion could sometimes be called first even if a Kohen is present and refuses to waive the first aliyah. Observing that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> able to tell whether a new approach can be considered a legitimate effort to develop the tradition or an illegitimate attempt to manipulate it, he suggested that changes in traditional concepts of respect involved in the idea of sometimes calling a woman to the Torah based on the Magen Avraham's ideas, may not necessarily be any more radical or threatening to the tradition, from a hashkfic (outlook or worldview) point of view, than the changes involved in developments leading to sometimes not calling a Kohen first.|$|E
