A field study was conducted that enrolled 139 households from California, which has had more stringent flame retardant requirements than other countries and areas.

Concentrations of each PBDE congener in different indoor environmental media were moderately correlated, with correlation coefficients ranging between 0. 42 and 0. 68. Correlation coefficients with blood levels were up to 0. 65 and varied between environmental media and age group.

40|$|Sterilisation of parasites {{prevents}} host reproduction, thereby diverting host {{resources to}} their own benefit. Previous theory predicts that parasites should evolve maximum virulence, yet hosts are often incompletely sterilised. Whereas prior attempts to resolve this paradox have sought evolu-tionary explanations, we present theory and experiments showing that incomplete sterilisation can arise from ecologically driven fluctuations in parasite load. The African ant–plant Acacia drepa-nolobium reproduced more when occupied by small colonies of the sterilising symbiont Crematog-aster nigriceps. In nature, small colonies result from interference competition between ant colonies; these territorial conflicts thus provide <b>intermittent</b> <b>windows</b> of opportunity for host reproduction. Our mean-field model shows that numerical insufficiency of parasites can produce partial sterilisation of host populations, creating the appearance of reduced virulence even if ants have evolved to sterilise completely. This general framework helps explain both the apparent ubiq-uity of partial sterilisation parasitism {{and the ability of}} these symbiotic associations to persist...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} that observation of everyday rhythmical actions biases subsequent motor {{execution of the}} same and of different actions, using a paradigm where the observed actions were irrelevant for action execution. The cycle time of the distractor actions was subtly manipulated across trials, and the cycle time of motor responses served as the main dependent measure. Although distractor frequencies reliably biased response cycle times, this imitation bias was {{only a small fraction}} of the modulations in distractor speed, as well as of the modulations produced when participants intentionally imitated the observed rhythms. Importantly, this bias was not only present for compatible actions, but was also found, though numerically reduced, when distractor and executed actions were different (e. g., tooth brushing vs. <b>window</b> <b>wiping),</b> or when the dominant plane of movement was different (horizontal vs. vertical). In addition, these effects were equally pronounced for execution at 0, 4, and 8 s after action observation, a finding that contrasts with the more short-lived effects reported in earlier studies. The imitation bias was also unaffected when vision of the hand was occluded during execution, indicating that this effect most likely resulted from visuomotor interactions during distractor observation, rather than from visual monitoring and guidance during execution. Finally, when the distractor was incompatible in both dimensions (action type and plane) the imitation bias was not reduced further, in an additive way, relative to the single-incompatible conditions. This points to a mechanism whereby the observed action’s impact on motor processing is generally reduced whenever thi...|$|R

After globally and locally calibrating a 25, 218 DOF 3 D FE model of a major bridge, the average error between the model and experimental frequencies is determined to be 2. 3 % for the frequencies of the first 15 modes. The confidence in the simulated local characteristics such as the stresses and distortions is judged to be around 50 - 75 %, based on local calibration results.

He pointed dramatically across the street many times and fell back, tears running down his face.

40|$|Compliant {{manipulation}} {{is one of}} {{the grand}} challenges for autonomous robots. Many household chores in human environments, such as cleaning the floor or <b>wiping</b> <b>windows,</b> rely on this principle. At the same time these tasks often require whole-body motions to cover a larger workspace. The performance of the actual task itself is thereby dependent on a large number of parameters that have to be taken into account. To tackle this issue we propose to utilize low-level compliant whole-body control strategies parameterized by high-level hybrid reasoning mechanisms. We categorize compliant wiping actions in order to determine relevant control parameters. According to these parameters we set up process models for each identified wiping action and implement generalized control strategies based on human task knowledge. We evaluate our approach experimentally on three whole-body manipulation tasks, namely scrubbing a mug with a sponge, skimming a window with a window wiper and bi-manually collecting the shards of a broken mug with a broom...|$|R

The UC series featured a significantly modernised frontal appearance and a completely new interior dash layout. Torana was now rationalised to a choice of two equipment levels and two six-cylinder engines, the 2.85-litre and the 3.3-litre. A 'Deluxe Pack' was an option that allowed the UC Torana SL to compete with Ford's TE Cortina Ghia, which comprised laminated windscreen, tinted side and rear <b>windows,</b> <b>intermittent</b> wipers, radio/cassette player, cloth trim, sports instrumentation, and bumper overriders. While the V8 was discontinued in the UC, a factory sanctioned dealer option of a turbo was offered. This was called the UC SL/T.

40|$|Abstract—To {{study the}} {{stability}} of a nominal cyclic steady state in power electronic converters, {{it is necessary to}} obtain a lineariza-tion around the periodic orbit. In many past studies, this was achieved by explicitly deriving the Poincaré map that describes the evolution of the state from one clock instant to the next and then locally linearizing the map at the fixed point. However, in many converters, the map cannot be derived in closed form, and therefore this approach cannot directly be applied. Alternatively, the orbital stability can be worked out by studying the evolution of perturbations about a nominal periodic orbit, and some studies along this line have also been reported. In this paper, we show that Filippov’s method—which has commonly been applied to mechanical switching systems—can be used fruitfully in power electronic circuits to achieve the same end by describing the behavior of the system during the switchings. By combining this and the Floquet theory, it is possible to describe {{the stability of}} power electronic converters. We demonstrate the method using the example of a voltage-mode-controlled buck converter oper-ating in continuous conduction mode. We find that the stability of a converter is strongly dependent upon the so-called saltation matrix—the state transition matrix relating the state just after the switching to that just before. We show that the Filippov approach, especially the structure of the saltation matrix, offers some addi-tional insights on issues related to the stability of the orbit, like the recent observation that coupling with spurious signals coming from the environment causes <b>intermittent</b> subharmonic <b>windows.</b> Based on this approach, we also propose a new controller that can significantly extend the parameter range for nominal period- 1 operation.
