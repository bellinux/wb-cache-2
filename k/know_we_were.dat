It's her that cannot be by herself no matter where she goes or what she does, because she's who she is." ...|$|E

[...] Activision obtained model Erin Layne to play Jeanette in promotional material for the game. Layne worked with Bloodlines artist Tim Bradstreet for a day to provide the poses chosen by Activision to represent Jeanette in the game's posters, clothing, and other items.|$|E
500|$|The first {{expedition}} {{to visit the}} ice stream was a United States over-snow traverse, where they spent around {{a week in the}} area of PIG during January 1961. They dug snow pits to measure snow accumulation and carried out seismic surveys to measure ice thickness. One of the scientists on this traverse was Charles R. Bentley, who claims [...] "we didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> crossing a glacier at the time." [...] This is not surprising, because PIG is around [...] wide at the point visited and at ground level cannot be visually distinguished from the surrounding ice. This expedition was called the Ellsworth Highland Traverse.|$|E
500|$|Wednesday 13 {{explained}} the album's inspiration in an interview: [...] "Wednesday 13 (the band) has a live DVD that I put {{out and we}} couldn't think of a title and we were driving down the road thinking, {{we are going to}} have to come up with a name for it. The live titles, you have to put something like that. So, we were watching Bill O'Reilly and we kept listening to him say, 'Fuck it, we'll do it live.' That's kind of how quick we threw that DVD together. We didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> putting it together like 4 days before so we were like, 'fuck it, we'll do it live.' We didn't do any overdubs on it, everybody in the band was sick and we just went with it." ...|$|E

500|$|During {{recording}} {{there was}} pressure from I.R.S. Records {{to try to}} make the album more commercial. The label sent messages to Dixon and Easter, which the producers told the band that they would ignore. While the producers respected I.R.S. president Jay Boberg, they expressed dismay at the comments he made when he visited during the last day of sessions. Dixon called Boberg [...] "record company clueless", while Easter said [...] "I got along with Jay Boberg OK [...] but now and again he would express an opinion that would make me think, 'holy shit', because it would strike me as really teenage." [...] Buck said he was grateful that Dixon and Easter acted as a buffer between the band and its label. He said that [...] "it got to the point where as much as I respected the guys at I.R.S., we basically tried to record the records so they wouldn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> recording them!", and explained that part of the reason why R.E.M. recorded the album so quickly was that the group wanted to finish before representatives from I.R.S. showed up to listen to it.|$|E
500|$|On February 4, 2008 a {{re-recording}} of [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] {{was posted}} on the band's Myspace. The album was reissued on February 19. The reissue has different cover artwork, as well as four bonus tracks – the track listing of which was revealed on February 1. The bonus tracks are: a new song recorded especially for the reiussue, titled [...] "Why Walk on Water When We've Got Boats", two re-recorded songs that were originally featured on their debut album, And Their Name Was Treason – [...] "Heartless" [...] and the aforementioned [...] "You Should've Killed Me When You Had the Chance" [...] – and a cover of the Kelly Clarkson song, [...] "Since U Been Gone". The new tracks were recorded at The Wade Studio. In addition to these bonus tracks, is a bonus DVD with footage of A Day to Remember's performance in Ocala, two music videos, as well as behind the scenes footage of recording and commentary on the re-release. The re-release came about after Victory asked the band whether or not {{if they were going}} to do a new album. Commenting about Victory's inquiry about a new album, Woodard [...] "We weren't ready to do it , so they asked if, you <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> interested in doing a re-release with new artwork and adding some new songs." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seahawks {{head coach}} Mike Holmgren fueled the debate upon {{returning}} to Seattle, saying during a Seahawks rally, [...] "We {{knew it was}} going to be tough going up against the Pittsburgh Steelers. I didn't <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> going to have to play the guys in the striped shirts as well." [...] Al Michaels commented during a Sunday Night Football game a few months later, [...] "The fact that Holmgren was not fined for that statement speaks volumes to me." [...] Michaels explained he was alluding to Holmgren's need to [...] "blow off steam", but also suggested a perceived admission by the NFL that something went wrong in that game. Both Michaels and John Madden noted Seattle's mistakes, such as poor clock management at the end of each half.|$|E

2500|$|On 6 November 1997, Short sent {{a letter}} to Kumbirai Kangai, Minister of Agriculture in Zimbabwe, in which she stated that [...] "we do not accept that Britain has a special {{responsibility}} to meet the costs of land purchase in Zimbabwe." [...] She went on to write [...] "We are a new government from diverse backgrounds, without links to former colonial interests. My own origins are Irish and, as you <b>know,</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> colonised, not colonisers." [...] In the same letter she did, however, offer qualified support for land reform: [...] "We do recognise the very real issues you face over land reform... we would be prepared to support a programme of land reform that was part of a poverty eradication strategy, but not on any other basis." [...] This letter caused a rift with the Zimbabwean government, which asserted that the Lancaster House Agreement of 1979 had contained a continuing pledge from the United Kingdom government to assist in land reform.|$|E
2500|$|With the {{exception}} of The Elephant Man and Dune, which are set in Victorian London and a fictitious galaxy respectively, all of Lynch's films have been set in the United States, and he has stated that [...] "I like certain things about America and it gives me ideas. When I go around and I see things, it sparks little stories, or little characters pop out, so it just feels right to me to, you know, make American films." [...] A number of his works, including Blue Velvet, Twin Peaks and Lost Highway are intentionally reminiscent of the 1950s American culture despite being set in the later decades of the 20th century. Lynch stated that [...] "It was a fantastic decade {{in a lot of}} ways... there was something in the air that is not there any more at all. It was such a great feeling, and not just because I was a kid. It was a really hopeful time, and things were going up instead of going down. You got the feeling you could do anything. The future was bright. Little did we <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> for a disastrous future." ...|$|E
2500|$|Winning the toss and batting, India reached 5/311 by stumps on {{the opening}} day. India were bowled out for 469 on the second day, after Ganguly scored his 16th and last Test century. Hayden was bowled for a third-ball duck, while Ponting was trapped lbw by a Sharma off cutter for five, as Australia {{collapsed}} to 5/58 and then 8/144 in their first innings reply. Shane Watson and Brett Lee combined for 73 eight wicket partnership, helping Australia reach a meagre 268. In the home-side's second innings, Ponting was criticised for using part-timers against the free-scoring Indian batsmen after he was informed that he was five overs behind the required over rate, which is penalisable by a fine, or in severe instances, a ban to the captain. This meant {{that he was not}} able to use pace spearhead Brett Lee significantly. A long discussion between Lee and Ponting prompted media allegations of a team rift, something Ponting denied. [...] "It seems like there are people trying to make a bit more of that than what it actually was," [...] Ponting said after his team's defeat. [...] "I made Brett aware he wasn't going to bowl first-thing in the morning. I let him <b>know</b> <b>we</b> <b>were</b> wanting to take pace off the ball." [...] Where it fell down a bit is I didn't communicate those reasons to Brett at 11am when he wanted to bowl. I made it clear to him from that moment on of those reasons." [...] After India declared on 3/314 with just over four sessions of play remaining, Australia were bowled out for 195 on the fifth morning, with Ponting's off stump knocked out of the ground by another Sharma off cutter for just 2, as India completed a 320 run victory.|$|E

But as you get a little older, or as I've gotten older, I've looked back on the symbol of Bad Religion as still having some meaning, but I wish it wasn't so offensive to other people, because other people could benefit from the ideas, I think, that we've laid down. For instance, what we look at it today as is just a symbol...the cross is sort of the international symbol [...] as this parking symbol, the no parking is...everybody in the world can recognize it. The cross we look at as an international symbol for religion, and it's not anti-Christian, it's not anti-Buddhist, it's not anti-Jewish, it's not anti-anything. It's simply is [...] showing...it's our way of showing that we don't like to subscribe to dogmatic ways of life and dogmatic views on life and that religion, in general, is founded in dogma and in restriction of ideas, restriction of thought and it's these things that I feel are bad about religion, it's also very bad about nationalistic views, it's very bad...it's something that mankind, as a group, is not going to benefit from; it's only something that mankind will... it's something mankind will...I'm sorry, it's something that will instill violence, and it will instill fighting, and it will instill non-cooperation of different groups of humans." ...|$|E
