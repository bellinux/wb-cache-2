5|$|Obesity {{can lead}} to social stigmatization and {{disadvantages}} in employment. When compared to their normal weight counterparts, obese workers on average have higher rates of absenteeism from work and take more disability leave, thus increasing costs for employers and decreasing productivity. A study examining Duke University employees found that people with a BMI over 40kg/m2 filed twice as many workers' compensation claims as those whose BMI was 18.5–24.9kg/m2. They also had more than 12times as many lost work days. The most common injuries in this group were due to falls and lifting, thus affecting the lower extremities, wrists or hands, and backs. The Alabama State Employees' Insurance Board approved a controversial plan to charge obese workers $25 a month for health insurance {{that would otherwise be}} free unless they take steps to lose weight and improve their health. These measures started in January 2010 and apply to those state workers whose BMI exceeds 35kg/m2 and who <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> improvements in their health after one year.|$|E

The irony of his appointment being that it was Ritchie's Barnsley side who stopped Jackson's Terriers from reaching the play-off final the previous season.|$|E
25|$|In , after three-straight first-round defeats, {{and despite}} a fourth-place finish in their {{division}} in the regular season, Chicago {{made it to the}} Conference Final in the rookie seasons of both goalie Ed Belfour and center Jeremy Roenick.

The Oilers were defeated by the Montreal Canadiens 4–3 in front of more than 55,000 fans, an NHL attendance record, at Commonwealth Stadium in Edmonton. The Oilers would <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs in the 2003–04 season.|$|E
25|$|Few {{could have}} {{expected}} the Cinderella season the Cats {{would have in}} 2006. They literally went from worst to first in the SEC, winning a regular-season conference title {{for the first time}} in three decades, and being ranked as high as fourth in the country by one major baseball poll during the season. However, the newly energized Kentucky baseball faithful saw the Cats crash out of the SEC tournament early and <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it out of the regionals of the NCAA tournament at home.|$|E

This marked the second losing season of Joe Gibbs' second term as head coach with the Redskins, compared to the one losing season {{he had in his}} first 12-year tenure as head coach. Despite the failures of the 2006 season, including free agent disasters Adam Archuleta and Brandon Lloyd, the year did see improvement in running back Ladell Betts and Campbell as quarterback.|$|E
25|$|The AFL has {{garnered}} {{increased interest}} in Ireland due {{to the introduction of}} the International Rules series played between an AFL picked All Australian Team and Ireland. This paved the way for young Irish footballers to be rostered to AFL teams mainly {{due to the fact that}} salaries in the AFL are much larger than that of Gaelic Football although most Irish players <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the grade into 1st team football. This also paved the way for extended news coverage and increased broadcasting in the UK and Ireland.|$|E
25|$|The {{film was}} reissued again on a {{separate}} two-disc Limited Edition DVD {{for a brief time}} from September 12, 2006, to December 31, 2006, this time with the film's original, unaltered version as bonus material. It was also re-released in a trilogy box set on November 4, 2008. There was controversy surrounding the initial release, because the DVDs featured non-anamorphic versions of the original films based on LaserDisc releases from 1993 (as opposed to newly remastered, film-based high definition transfers). Since non-anamorphic transfers <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> full use of the resolution available on widescreen televisions, many fans were disappointed with this choice.|$|E
50|$|The Stars <b>failed</b> <b>to</b> {{qualify for}} the playoffs.

25|$|After {{the heavy}} defeat to New Zealand their next {{international}} fixture would be during their second World Cup where the Tongans would again {{be placed in}} another tough group with France, Papua New Guinea again and the South Africans. Tonga would face South Africa in their first match of the tournament {{where they would be}} comfortable victors in a 66–18 drubbing, however the rest of the tournament would not be so kind to the Tongan side with losses to both France and Papua New Guinea meaning the Tongans would again <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it past the first stage of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|A {{legal service}} starts a rally, {{in which the}} players {{alternate}} hitting the ball across the net. A legal return consists of the player or team hitting the ball before it has bounced twice or hit any fixtures except the net, provided that it still falls in the server's court. A player or team cannot hit the ball twice in a row. The ball must travel past the net into the other players' court. A ball that hits the net during a rally is still considered a legal return {{as long as it}} crosses into {{the opposite side of the}} court. The first player or team to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a legal return loses the point. The server then moves to the other side of the service line at the start of a new point.|$|E

Satan's {{assistant}} Demonius finds a cake the exact {{size and shape of}} an Acura TSX as a last-minute substitute. Satan is infuriated that he did not receive the right cake. When Demonius points out that his guests are having fun regardless, Satan flies into a rage. The guests get upset and start to leave, and Satan realizes that, in trying to have a party like the girls on My Super Sweet 16, he became like one of them. He tells the crowd that he is sorry and invites everyone into the party, including the Catholic priests. Having arrived in Los Angeles, Butters uses a make-up mirror to summon Biggie Smalls to the party, who asks Butters to come in with him as thanks.|$|E

25|$|In Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2000), the Weasleys invite Harry and Hermione to the Quidditch World Cup. Ron is {{in awe of}} his {{favourite}} Quidditch champion, Viktor Krum. Ron is {{even more}} excited when Krum, still {{a student at the}} Durmstrang wizarding school, comes to Hogwarts {{to take part in the}} Triwizard Tournament, a magical wizarding tournament opposing the top three magic schools in Europe. However, when Harry, underage, mysteriously becomes the fourth Tournament champion, Ron joins the dissenters who think Harry somehow cheated his way into the tournament and feels let down; according to Hermione, this stems from Ron's latent envy caused by being left out of the spotlight shared by Harry or his brothers. The rift is serious enough that the friends <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up for nearly a month. They only reconcile shortly after Harry successfully gets by a fire-breathing dragon in the first task; Ron realises how dangerous the Tournament is and finally believes that Harry did not enter himself.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{considerable}} amount of evidence indicating that Fergus married a daughter of Henry I. For example, there is abundant documentary evidence suggesting that all three of Fergus' childrenUhtred, Gilla Brigte, and Affraicwere descended from this king. Specifically, Uhtred was called a cousin of Henry I's maternal-grandson, Henry II, King of England (died 1189), by Roger de Hoveden (died 1201/1202). Although sources specifically concerning Gilla Brigte <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a similar claim, potentially indicating that he had a different mother than Uhtred, Gilla Brigte's son, Donnchad, Earl of Carrick (died 1250), was certainly regarded as a kinsman of Henry II's son and successor, John, King of England (died 1216). In regard to Affraic, Robert de Torigni, Abbot of Mont Saint-Michel (died 1186) remarked that her son, Guðrøðr Óláfsson, King of Dublin and the Isles (died 1187), was related to Henry II through the latter's mother, Matilda (died 1167), one of Henry I's daughters.|$|E
25|$|The 1978 album Hot Streets was {{produced}} by Phil Ramone. It was Chicago's first album with a title rather than a number; and was the band's first LP to {{have a picture of}} the band (shot by photographer Norman Seeff) featured prominently on the cover (with the ubiquitous logo downsized). These two moves were seen by many as indications that the band had changed following Kath's death. To a degree, the band returned to the old naming scheme on its subsequent releases, although most titles would now bear Arabic numerals rather than Roman numerals. Hot Streets, the band's 12th album, peaked at No. 12 on the Billboard charts; it was Chicago's first release since their debut to <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the Top 10. The release also marked a move somewhat away from the jazz-rock direction favored by Kath and towards more pop songs and ballads. Dacus stayed with the band through the 1979 album Chicago 13, and is also featured in a promotional video on the DVD included in the Rhino Records Chicago box set from 2003. Again produced by Ramone, it was the group's first studio album not to contain a Top 40 hit. Dacus departed from the band shortly after the album's release.|$|E

25|$|On April 9, the Colts {{announced}} they {{had picked up}} the fifth-year option on Luck's contract, which will pay him a guaranteed $16.55 million in 2016. In Weeks 4 and 5, Luck missed the first two games of his career with an injured shoulder. Backup Matt Hasselbeck played in his place and led the team to a 16–13 overtime win over the Jacksonville Jaguars, followed by a 27–20 Thursday Night Football victory over the Houston Texans. Luck returned to the lineup on October 18 in a 34–27 loss to the New England Patriots. On November 2, Luck led the Colts back from a 17-point deficit in the fourth quarter to force overtime against the Carolina Panthers, but his third interception of the game helped lead to the Panthers' three-point win. On November 10, it was announced that Luck would miss 2–6 weeks with a lacerated kidney and a partially torn abdominal muscle, suffered during the fourth quarter of the Colts 27–24 win over the previously undefeated Denver Broncos two days prior. However, the recovery process took much longer than expected and Luck did not return {{for the rest of the}} season. The Colts would <b>fail</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the playoffs for the first time with Luck, ending the season 8–8. He was ranked 92nd by his fellow players on the NFL Top 100 Players of 2016.|$|E
