40|$|Policy {{conditionality}} {{has been}} a frequently used tool {{in the context of}} the Euro zone crisis management. By linking the <b>disbursement</b> <b>of</b> loan <b>instalments</b> to specific policy requirements the macro-economic adjustment programmes used conditionality as leverage to promote structural reforms. How does conditionality induce policy change?
