50|$|Jill Price (née Jill Rosenberg December 30, 1965) is an American woman, from Southern California, who {{has been}} {{diagnosed}} with <b>hyperthymesia.</b> She {{was the first person}} to receive such a diagnosis, and it was her case that inspired research into <b>hyperthymesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|There are six true {{cases of}} <b>hyperthymesia</b> {{that have been}} {{confirmed}} worldwide. Cases of <b>hyperthymesia</b> differ from related cases of savant memory in that savants have an extraordinary memory for specific hobbies, and events of a narrow basis, whereas cases of confirmed <b>hyperthymesia</b> show surprisingly detailed memory for specific and general events. One example {{is the case of}} AJ (revealed, since May 2008, to be the school administrator Jill Price) who, given any date in history, can recall what the weather was like on said date, personal details of her life at the time, and other news events that occurred at that time. Details of what AJ recalls may be significant to her in some way, but they may not. Personal meaning does not seem to affect AJ's memory—she simply recalls everything. Brad Williams, another confirmed case of <b>hyperthymesia,</b> displays similar remarkable memory abilities. For example, when shown a photograph from his past Brad can recall the date it was taken, where it was taken, what he had done that day, and even more detailed information such as the temperature on said day. Rick Barron has also been diagnosed with <b>hyperthymesia</b> and shares the same superior abilities of AJ and Brad. Individuals with <b>hyperthymesia</b> clearly have a superior degree of recall ability.|$|E

5000|$|In the 2014 film The Dark Place, {{the protagonist}} of the story, Keegan Dark, has <b>hyperthymesia.</b> A mystery-thriller with {{dramatic}} overtones, Keegan's <b>hyperthymesia</b> is shown to have caused significant pain in his family life, as his inability to forget childhood and adolescent traumas has put him at odds with his parents, siblings, and friends. It also becomes an advantage, with Keegan using it {{to solve the mystery}} {{at the heart of the}} story. The <b>hyperthymesia</b> memories are visually depicted in the movie as [...] "screens" [...] appearing to Keegan, often in an overwhelming and distressing manner.|$|E

5000|$|Unlike {{other people}} with {{advanced}} memory abilities, such as savant syndrome (who tend to use calendrical calculation), individuals with hyperthymestic syndrome rely heavily on their personal [...] "mental calendar", which is an automatic and obsessive process. Moreover, individuals with <b>hyperthymesia</b> do not focus on practiced mnemonic strategies. For example, [...] "AJ", who has the first documented case of <b>hyperthymesia,</b> has difficulty consciously applying her memory strategies to help her memorize new knowledge, making her rote memorization abilities below average.|$|E

50|$|Daniel McCartney (September 10, 1817 - November 15, 1887) was an American who {{had what}} {{is now known as}} HSAM--Highly Superior Autobiographical Memory, {{formerly}} <b>Hyperthymesia.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{capabilities}} of the affected individuals {{are not limited to}} recalling specific events from their personal experience. <b>Hyperthymesia</b> has both enhanced autobiographical and episodic memory There are two important characteristics of hyperthymesia: ...|$|E
5000|$|As of November 2013, 25 {{cases of}} <b>hyperthymesia</b> have been {{confirmed}} in peer-reviewed articles, the first being that of [...] "AJ" [...] (real name Jill Price) in 2006. More cases have been identified that are yet to be published. [...] AJ's case was originally reported by researchers from the University of California, Irvine, Elizabeth Parker, Larry Cahill, and James McGaugh, and is credited as being the first case of <b>hyperthymesia.</b> AJ can apparently recall every day of her life from when she was 14 years old: [...] "Starting on February 5th, 1980, I remember everything. That was a Tuesday." ...|$|E
5000|$|Cases of <b>hyperthymesia</b> {{have forced}} {{many people to}} re-evaluate {{what is meant by}} [...] "healthy" [...] memory: [...] "it isn't just about {{retaining}} the significant stuff. Far more important is being able to forget the rest." ...|$|E
5000|$|In a 2011 manga by manga artist Kohske called [...] "Gangsta", main {{character}} Worick Arcangelo {{is said to}} have <b>hyperthymesia</b> which he uses to help police identify murder victims of people in the town of Ergastulum.|$|E
50|$|Individuals {{identified}} as having a condition known as <b>hyperthymesia</b> are able to remember very intricate details of their own personal life, but the ability seems not to extend to other, non-autobiographical information. They may have vivid recollections such as who they were with, what they were wearing, {{and how they were}} feeling on a specific date many years in the past. Patients under study, such as Jill Price, show brain scans that resemble those with obsessive-compulsive disorder. In fact, Price's unusual autobiographical memory has been attributed as a byproduct of compulsively making journal and diary entries. Hyperthymestic patients may additionally suffer from depression stemming from the inability to forget unpleasant memories and experiences from the past. It is a misconception that <b>hyperthymesia</b> suggests any eidetic ability.|$|E
5000|$|Price is able {{to recite}} details of every day of her life since she was {{fourteen}} years old. She can recall various obscure moments {{of her life in}} great detail. Her condition, termed <b>hyperthymesia,</b> or [...] "hyperthymestic syndrome", is characterized by a highly superior autobiographical memory.|$|E
5000|$|Serving as a {{consultant}} on the series is actress Marilu Henner who, like the series' lead character Carrie Wells, possesses <b>hyperthymesia</b> in real life. She had a guest spot in the episode [...] "Golden Bird", as Wells' aunt, who is suffering from symptoms {{similar to that of}} Wells' mother's early-onset Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1942 {{short story}} [...] "Funes the Memorious" [...] by Jorge Luis Borges the protagonist suffers {{a head injury}} after which he gains the ability to {{remember}} every detail of what he experiences, but comes to view this as a curse. The condition may not technically {{be an example of}} <b>hyperthymesia,</b> but shares some features.|$|E
5000|$|The very {{existence}} of eidetic memory is controversial, although <b>hyperthymesia,</b> now known as highly superior autobiographical memory (HSAM), the ability to recall one's past day-by-day, has been confirmed to exist by some neuroscientists (Parker et al. 2006). Even in these cases, however, the memory is not eidetic as, while exceptional, it only contains personally-relevant autobiographical information ...|$|E
5000|$|Individuals with <b>hyperthymesia</b> {{can recall}} {{almost every day}} {{of their lives in}} near perfect detail, as well as public events that hold some {{personal}} significance to them. Those affected describe their memories as uncontrollable associations; when they encounter a date, they [...] "see" [...] a vivid depiction of that day in their heads. [...] Recollection occurs without hesitation or conscious effort.|$|E
50|$|Others {{suspect that}} <b>hyperthymesia</b> {{may be a}} result of {{reviewing}} memories constantly to an obsessive-compulsive degree. Other findings have shown that the tendencies to absorb new information and fantasize are personality traits that are higher in hyperthymestics {{than the rest of the}} population. These traits: absorption and fantasizing also correlated with one of the tests that measures superior autobiographical memory within the hyperthymestic sample.|$|E
5000|$|AJ {{displays}} considerable {{difficulty in}} memorizing allocentric information. [...] "Her autobiographical memory, while incredible, is also selective and even ordinary in some respects," [...] - McGaugh. This was demonstrated by AJ's poor performance on standardised memory tests. At school, AJ was an average student, clearly unable to apply her exceptional memory to her studies. Similar patterns {{have been observed}} in other cases of <b>hyperthymesia.</b>|$|E
50|$|As the {{condition}} has become better known, more people {{claiming to have}} hyperthymestic abilities have emerged. In {{the aftermath of the}} 2006 Neurocase publication alone, more than 200 people contacted McGaugh; however, only a handful of cases were determined to be actual cases of <b>hyperthymesia.</b> The second verified case was Brad Williams, the third was Rick Baron, and in 2009, Bob Petrella became the fourth person diagnosed with hyperthymestic syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Parker {{and colleagues}} {{used a variety}} of {{standardised}} neuropsychological tests in their diagnosis of AJ's <b>hyperthymesia.</b> These included tests of memory, lateralisation, executive functions, language, calculations, IQ, and visual-spatial and visual-motor functions. They also devised novel tests to examine the extent of her memory abilities. These mostly consisted of questions pertaining to specific dates and events in history. Some of her personal recollections were verified with diary entries, as well as by her mother.|$|E

It was published in November 2010. Bakker has planned a number of follow up novels to Disciple of the Dog, including The Enlightened Dead, but due to the first novels poor reception and very few reviews the sequels have not been pursued.|$|E
