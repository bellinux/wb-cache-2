40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{symmetric}} equilibria of a two-buyer, two-seller model of directed search in which sellers commit to information provision. More informed buyers have better differentiated private valuations and extract higher rents from trade. I establish how the char-acteristics of exogenously <b>fixed</b> <b>sale</b> mechanisms determine equilibrium information provision {{and show that}} competition generates complementarities between allocative and informational efficiency. Information provision is higher under competition than under monopoly, yet partial information is provided for many natural sale mechanisms. In contrast, when sellers commit to both information provision and sale mechanisms, I identify simple conditions under which every equilibrium has full information. Sellers capture the efficiency gains from increased information and compete only over non-distortionary rents offered to buyers...|$|E
40|$|The book “Social Housing. A {{handbook}} for designers” is {{the first}} in a series on social housing and is intended as a means for opening up dialogue and spreading the viewpoint of some of the more advanced forms of housing policy. It is an organ for divulging results achieved in this sector in Italy on a national and international scale; for enlarging the awareness of social housing, best practices and the acquired knowhow of the writers. The series consists of a number of books which cover specific topics and detail the procedures, processes, projects, and proposals on offer for affordable housing and rent-capped accommodation, packed full of stories which relate experiences favouring social cohesion, integration of the community and sustainable environments. One of the goals is to bring all the process, design and technological innovation under one roof. That is to say, those aimed at offering added value to housing and services in the rent capping or <b>fixed</b> <b>sale</b> price sector, compared to those on the market, while increasing the standard of living of the home, reducing construction costs and optimising the construction process. The series is a focal point for swapping knowledge on national housing policy based on a welfare mix system, state of the art home design and real-life experiences in different countries, besides allowing room for reflection on the experience of the Fondo Investimenti per l’Abitare (“FIA”) financed by Cassa Depositi e Prestiti aimed at the establishment of local funds set aside for social housing construction projects; on the pathways of the housing co-operatives, starting from their traditional presence within the territory; on the importance of social management and experiences which support the demand for emergency housing sponsored and set in motion by the no-profit foundations and organizations...|$|E

We determine the critical value of ρ under which the value function is finite. We examine the validity of the "principle of smooth fit" and use this to give a complete and essentially explicit solution to the problem, which exhibits a surprisingly rich structure. The corresponding result when the stock price evolves according to the Black and Scholes model is obtained as a limit case. ...|$|R

Secondly, the Commission agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those <b>fixing</b> <b>sale</b> prices) from Article 101.

5000|$|In 1980, the gas 350 was {{replaced}} with the 368 except in California, where the Oldsmobile 350 was used. In both the 1980 Seville and Eldorado (which shared frames) the 368s came with DEFI (later known as throttle body injection when it was later used with other GM corporate engines), whereas in the larger RWD Cadillacs it came only with a 4-barrel Quadrajet carburetor. Independent rear suspension was adopted, helping retain rear-seat and trunk room in the smaller body. The most notable styling touch was an extreme notchback roofline. The Eldorado Biarritz model resurrected the stainless-steel roof concept from the first Brougham. The Eldorado featured frameless door glass, and the rear quarter windows re-appeared as they did before 1971, without a thick [...] "B" [...] pillar.

40|$|Abstract. A {{decision}} problem is investigated in a decentralized two-echelon supply chain with one manufacturer and one retailer during a <b>fixed</b> <b>sales</b> time. There are three possible power balance scenarios: Manufacturer-Stackelberg, retailer-Stackelberg, vertical Nash classified by the different {{influence on the}} market between the manufacturer and the retailer. Aiming at profit maximization,from the perspectives of the consumer, the manufacturer and the retailer, respectively, {{the results of the}} three scenarios are analyzed, in which the retailer price P, warranty period W and the whole price CP are decision variables. Moreover, the sales over time can be characterized by a stochastic Bass model {{in the form of a}} non-homogeneous Poisson process (NHPP-Bass model) and the production system is a make-to-order type of system. Finally, A numerical example is provided to illustrate the effects of some key parameters, including the product reliability, price elasticity, and warranty period elasticity, on the optimal settings of the retail price and warranty period...|$|R
50|$|Exemptions to Article 101 {{behaviour}} {{fall into}} three categories. First, Article 101(3) creates an exemption where {{the practice is}} beneficial to consumers, e.g., by facilitating technological advances (efficiencies), but does not restrict all competition in the area. In practice very few official exemptions were given by the Commission and a new system for dealing with them is currently under review. Secondly, the Commission has agreed to exempt 'Agreements of minor importance' (except those <b>fixing</b> <b>sale</b> prices) from Article 101. This exemption applies to small companies, together holding no more than 10% of the relevant market {{in the case of}} horizontal agreements and 15% each in the case of vertical agreements (the de minimis condition). In this situation as with Article 102 (see below), market definition is a crucial, but often highly difficult, matter to resolve. Thirdly, the Commission has also introduced a collection of block exemptions for different types of contract and in particular in the case of vertical agreements. These include a list of permitted contract terms, and a list of those banned in these exemptions (the so-called hardcore restrictions).|$|R

40|$|When {{customers}} {{buy a new}} product, {{the reliability}} related {{issues such as the}} warranty/post-warranty service and the performance of the product are becoming important factors in the customers' decision-making process. In this dissertation, some important aspects in estimating both warranty and post-warranty repair demands have been studied. To ensure the new product will have a good performance, the availability of a repairable k-out-of-n:G system considering spare parts logistics is investigated. The installed base of the product varies with time due to both new sales and units being taken out of service is considered. We explicitly address the fact that customers may not always request repairs for failed units and formulate the corresponding warranty and post-warranty repair demands for a general failure process. For the case where the product failure time is exponential, we derive the closed-form expressions for the two types of repair demands for both an individual unit and the installed base. A step further, we develop an integrated model to estimate the gross profit for a new durable product to be sold in a <b>fixed</b> <b>sales</b> period at a <b>fixed</b> price. The <b>sales</b> over time is characterized by a stochastic Bass model and the production system is a make-to-order type of system. An approximate, yet accurate approach is developed to quantify the expected total cost of production involving a learning effect. The analysis of key parameters that affect the optimal gross profit is carried out in numerical examples. Finally, the availability management of a new product (or system) is studied. We introduce a collection of operational availability maximization problems, in which the component redundancy levels and the spares stock quantities are to be determined simultaneously under economic and physical constraints...|$|R
