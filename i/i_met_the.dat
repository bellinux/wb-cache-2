500|$|By {{the time}} of the Maharishi's death in 2008, more than 5 million people had learned Transcendental Meditation, and his {{worldwide}} movement was valued in the billions of dollars. The ashram, built on land belonging to the Rajaji National Park, was reclaimed by the government in the mid-1990s after the lease expired in 1981, and fell into disrepair. After the Maharishi died, McCartney said: [...] "my memories of him will only be joyful ones. He was a great man who worked tirelessly {{for the people of the}} world and the cause of unity". Starr said in 2008, [...] "I feel so blessed <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Maharishi– he gave me a mantra that no one can take away, and I still use it". In 2009, McCartney, Starr, Donovan, and Horn reunited at a concert held at New York's Radio City Music Hall to benefit the David Lynch Foundation, which funds the teaching of Transcendental Meditation in schools. A 2008 article in Rolling Stone magazine reported Yoko Ono as saying: [...] "John would have been the first one now, if he had been here, to recognize and acknowledge what Maharishi has done for the world and appreciate it". Author Gary Tillery wrote in 2010 that Lennon [...] "benefited from the experience" [...] and [...] "for the rest of his life he often turned to meditation to restore himself and improve his creativity." ...|$|E

2500|$|Before marrying Barry, Greenwich wrote {{songs with}} {{different}} partners, including Ben Raleigh (co-writer on Barry's first hit as a composer, [...] "Tell Laura I Love Her," [...] in 1960) and Mark Barkan. She {{was also a}} session singer, recording so many demos that she became known as New York's Demo Queen. Her biggest hits during this period were written with Tony Powers. The Greenwich-Powers team made the charts with tunes such as [...] "He's Got The Power" [...] (The Exciters), [...] "(Today <b>I</b> <b>Met)</b> <b>The</b> Boy I'm Gonna Marry" [...] (Darlene Love), and [...] "Why Do Lovers Break Each Others' Hearts?" [...] (Bob B. Soxx & the Blue Jeans, with Love on lead vocal). These last two were co-written and produced by Phil Spector, who had been introduced to the songs, and to Greenwich, by music publisher Aaron Schroeder.|$|E

2500|$|The {{bishops of}} Naumburg, the landgraves of Thuringia and the margraves of Meissen as lords {{of the town}} of Naumburg {{promoted}} a systematic development of the city into the most important town in the Saale-Unstrut region. In March 1131, Bishop Udo <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> Cistercian abbot Bernard of Clairvaux at the Imperial Diet in Liège in March 1131, a meeting of central signiﬁcance for the propagation of the Cistercian order in the Empire. As a result, a delegation of monks from the Walkenried Cistercian monastery moved to a location next to Naumburg in 1137/1138. The founding of the Cistercian Pforta Monastery contributed to the propagation of the Order on to Eastern Europe. One of the greatest achievements of Pforta Monastery was furthermore the settlement of peasants in these regions. This so-called ″Landesausbau″ in the High Middle Ages was supplemented by military protection of the positions already achieved.|$|E
2500|$|During the summers, {{he would}} work in a more typical Impressionist location, such as Appledore Island, {{the largest of the}} Isles of Shoals off New Hampshire, then famous for its artist colony. Social life on the island {{revolved}} around the salon of poet Celia Thaxter who hosted artists and literary figures. The group was a [...] "jolly, refined, interesting and artistic set of people...like one large family." [...] There Hassam recalled, [...] "I spent some of my pleasantest summers...(and) where <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> best people in the country." [...] Hassam's subjects for his paintings included Thaxter's flower garden, the rocky landscape, and some interior scenes rendered with his most impressionistic brush strokes to date. In Impressionist fashion, he applied his colors [...] "perfectly clear out of the tube" [...] to unprimed canvas without pre-mixing. Artists displayed their work in Thaxter's salon and were exposed to wealthy buyers staying on the island. Thaxter died in 1894, and in tribute Hassam painted her parlor in The Room of Flowers.|$|E

McLove entered the ring first, {{withstanding}} one wrestler's attack on his crotch because he has [...] "no willy", but was soon attacked by Father Damo, who brought the whistle he stole from Benson. Father Stone served as a special guest referee, performing a three-count so slow that one wrestler kicked out after two. In 2017, Rooney appeared as Father Damo in the video for Brave Giant's [...] "The Time <b>I</b> <b>Met</b> <b>the</b> Devil", which follows him {{on the way to}} give Mass after a night of alcohol and sex.|$|E

2500|$|The {{band has}} been {{categorized}} under many genres of heavy music. Mainly categorized as heavy metal, hard rock, progressive metal and metalcore, Avenged Sevenfold's music {{has evolved over}} most of the band's career. At first, the band's debut album Sounding the Seventh Trumpet consisted almost entirely of a metalcore sound; however, there were several deviations from this genre, most notably in [...] "Streets", which shows a punk rock style, and [...] "Warmness on the Soul", which is a piano ballad. On Waking the Fallen, the band displayed a metalcore style once more, but added more clean singing and leaned a bit more towards metal and bit less close to hardcore. In the band's DVD All Excess, producer Andrew Murdock explained this transition: [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>met</b> <b>the</b> band after Sounding the Seventh Trumpet had come out before they had recorded Waking the Fallen, M. Shadows said to me 'This record is screaming. The record we want to make is going to be half-screaming half-singing. I don't want to scream anymore. And the record after {{that is going to be}} all singing'." ...|$|E
2500|$|An entirely {{different}} type of person was Virendranath Chattopadhyay, member of a famous family in India. Popularly known as Chatto {{he was a very}} able and a very delightful person. He was always hard up, his clothes were very much the worse for wear and often he found it difficult to raise the wherewithal for a meal. But his humour and light heartedness never left him. He had been some years senior to me during my educational days in England. He was at Oxford when I was at Harrow. Since those days he had not returned to India and sometimes a fit of homesickness came to him when he longed to be back. All his home-ties had long been severed and it is quite certain that if he came to India he would feel unhappy and out of joint. But in spite of the passage of time the home pull remains. No exile can escape the malady of his tribe, that consumption of the soul, as Mazzini called it ... Of the few <b>I</b> <b>met,</b> <b>the</b> only persons who impressed me intellectually were Virendranath Chattopadhyay and M.N. Roy. Chatto was not, I believe, a regular communist, but he was communistically inclined.|$|E
