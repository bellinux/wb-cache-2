The <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> received 70% of the nominal value of their holdings and the shareholders received nothing.|$|E
5|$|Both clubs {{received}} an allocation of approximately 20,000 tickets, {{out of a}} total capacity of 52,063. The remaining seats are accounted for by Hampden Park <b>debenture</b> <b>holders,</b> hospitality, sponsors, media and segregation areas. In excess of 1,000 unused debentures were distributed to each club. The allocation was enough to provide for the season ticket holders of each club, with Hearts having 10,000 and Hibs 7,500 approximately, although both clubs anticipated that there would be little or no need for a general public sale. Hearts decided to sell tickets using their loyalty points system, while Hibs connected their allocation to sales of season tickets and memberships. Due to high demand, Hearts tightened the criteria needed for a ticket during the sales process. Regular tickets cost £35 or £28 for adults and £10 for children under 15 years old.|$|E

50|$|After the Company's {{failure in}} 1895 {{it was sold}} to its <b>debenture</b> <b>holder,</b> John Brightling, who {{continued}} to operate the line until its sale to the Christchurch Tramway Board in 1906.|$|R
5000|$|Brightlife Ltd had {{a charge}} over book debts {{in favour of}} Norandex, its bank. The charge {{said it was a}} [...] "first {{specific}} charge" [...] and did not allow Brightlife to sell, factor or discount debts without written consent. A <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> gave the company a notice converting the floating charge into a fixed charge a week before a voluntary winding up resolution was passed. Counsel argued public policy required restriction on crystallising events, one reason being that an automatic crystallisation clause could take effect without knowledge of company or <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> It could be prejudicial to a third party, because it does not get registered. Counsel referred to the Canadian case R v Consolidated Churchill Copper Corp Ltd, where Berger J rejected the concept of a [...] "self generating crystallisation".|$|R
25|$|The {{company would}} have {{probably}} survived the trade depression of the late 1870s {{were it not for}} the untimely intervention of one of the old Llynvi company's <b>Debenture</b> <b>Holders,</b> probably George Moffatt, former chairman of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co Ltd. Moffatt decided to withdraw his large debenture holding in December 1877, a move which would have resulted in bankruptcy proceedings with disastrous consequences for the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> As a result, the holders opted for the lesser evil of voluntary liquidation. The merger of 1871–2 proved to be disastrous for the Brogdens as they forfeited effective control over their Welsh enterprises, and expanded their exposure to iron, at a time when the south Wales wrought iron trade was about to enter a period of terminal decline.|$|E
25|$|There was a {{restructuring}} of the company on 27 July 1925, a scheme of arrangement being made with shareholders and <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> such that the capital was reduced from £330,000 to £198,192. The following year saw the company take on the drawings and patterns of John Musgrave & Sons following the closure of that business.|$|E

Fans who invest thus in the club receive a pair of tickets for every day of the Wimbledon Championships for the five years the investment lasts. Only <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> are permitted to sell on their tickets to third parties and demand for debentures has increased in recent years, {{to such an extent that}} they are even traded on the London Stock Exchange.|$|E

5000|$|The case {{related to}} an appeal by a <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> against an order of Malins VC. The appeal came before Sir G.M. Giffard LJ.

25|$|An RFU {{debenture}} confers on the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> {{the right}} to purchase, at face value, one ticket for Rugby Union events at Twickenham Stadium for a given period, currently 10 years (with {{the exception of a}} small number of business debentures in the South Stand which confer ticket rights for 15 years). A debenture is fully repayable, currently after 75 years, but bears no interest.|$|R
25|$|Thanks to {{a handful}} of wealthy sympathisers, the sale of {{debentures}} was more successful but the identity of some of the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> suggests that many of these were donations rather than true investments. The first 20 debentures were bought by Edward Martyn, president of Sinn Féin from 1905 to 1908 and patron of many of Griffith's enterprises. John Sweetman, second president of Sinn Féin bought debentures 21 to 70, and the third most important investor, holder of 50 debentures, was Roger Casement, also a patron of many nationalist organisations until his execution {{in the aftermath of the}} 1916 Rising.|$|E
25|$|Because the {{misfeasance}} provision reflects {{causes of}} action vested in the company, any money recovered under it is held {{so that it}} will go to pay off creditors in their ordinary order of priority. In Re Anglo-Austrian Printing & Publishing Union this meant that a liquidator who had successfully sued directors for £7000 had to give up the funds to a group of <b>debenture</b> <b>holders,</b> who had not yet been paid in full, so there is no discretion to apply the assets in favour of unsecured creditors. A potential benefit is that because the causes of action are vested in the company, they may be assigned to third parties, who may prefer to take the risk and reward of pursuing litigation over the liquidator or administrator. These features are the reverse for money recovered through the statutory based causes of action of fraudulent and wrongful trading.|$|E
25|$|Although the Brogden {{family were}} the main {{shareholders}} in the new company and Alexander Brogden was the chairman, the family, for the first time, relinquished control over their fortunes as the new company had {{a large number of}} 'vocal' shareholders in the Manchester and Southport areas who closely monitored the progress of the new venture. In 1873, during a major strike among the iron company workers in south Wales, Alexander Brogden acted unilaterally and settled amicably with the workforce a month before the strike eventually ended {{in the rest of the}} coalfield. In the immediate aftermath of the strike Alexander Brogden was so highly regarded by his workforce in Maesteg that, for a time, it was suggested that the planned town hall in the valley should be named in his honour. By 1874 however, after a brief period of prosperity, profits slumped as the Tondu and Llynvi works faced competition from cheaper producers abroad and, more importantly, from cheap Bessemer steel. Losses accumulated until the company's <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> opted for voluntary liquidation in January 1878.|$|E
50|$|Following the {{rejection}} by WHLR (1964) Ltd of the FR plan {{to act as}} landlord, the FR realised {{that the only way}} to prevent the sale of the trackbed to GCC, was to challenge the application to the High Court by the OR, to sell the trackbed to GCC. However, the FR was not a share or <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> in the old WHLR company and thus it had no standing to be part of the High Court hearing.|$|R
50|$|In sport, a {{debenture}} {{is defined}} as a certificate of agreement of loans which is given under the company's stamp and carries an undertaking that the <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> will get a fixed return (fixed on the basis of interest rates) and the principal amount whenever the debenture matures. The terms may also include ancillary benefits such as an option to buy tickets at a favourable price, as well as or instead of interest. The term stems from the financial concept of a debenture.|$|R

Glen Eden issued a third debenture to Downsview and Russell carried on the business, losing a further $500,000.

500|$|The {{funds for}} the {{dividend}} payment were raised by a debenture of £50,000. By the end of 1890 many City figures were suspicious of the Hansard Union, and were calling it [...] "Bottomley's swindle". Despite Bottomley's outward optimism, in December 1890 the company defaulted on the payment of debenture interest and in May 1891, amid growing rumours of insolvency, the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> petitioned for the company's compulsory winding-up. In the same month Bottomley, who had taken at least £100,000 from the company, filed a petition for bankruptcy. Under examination by the Official Receiver, he could not say where the money had gone, and professed total ignorance of the company's book-keeping. After further enquiries, the Board of Trade instituted prosecutions for fraud against Bottomley, Isaacs and two others.|$|E
500|$|By {{the time}} that the {{rebellion}} was suppressed in 1653, and just prior to the first assignments of land {{under the terms of the}} Settlement of Ireland Act, 1652, Roger had registered the transfer of his investment to Erasmus. Erasmus had speculated by buying out the interests of other subscribers, who had tired of the delay in seeing a reward from their investment; and he was also entitled to further land grants in payment for his supplies to the army. What began as a grant of [...] eventually became— by the 1680s, after various wranglings and adjustments— over [...] situated in nine counties, and Erasmus had an estimated worth of £120,000. Some of these lands, notably those in Connaught, may have been obtained fraudulently by Erasmus, who together with his nephew Edward Smith, sat on the committee based at Grocers' Hall whose purpose was the allocation of lots for the distribution of land between the <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> Edward Smith was subsequently appointed to a Court of Claims in Dublin, where he may also have favoured his uncle Erasmus in his applications for land.|$|E
2500|$|The {{company was}} placed in {{receivership}} on the application of its <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> in 1912, despite the business being [...] "much more promising than for some time past". The cause of this was a proposal to issue prior lien debentures {{to the value of}} £50,000, a move which would dilute the position of existing <b>debenture</b> <b>holders.</b> It was reported that the company might be restructured in order to resolve this issue.|$|E

50|$|Mactrac Ltd was {{a company}} {{carrying}} {{on the business}} of builders and civil engineers. Mactrac Ltd was the beneficial owner of 100% of the issued share capital in C&K (Construction) Ltd. On 3 March 1962 a receiver was appointed withg respect to Mactrac Ltd by a <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> Accounts would later show {{that at this time}} the company had a deficiency of assets against liabilities in the total sum of £389,977.

2500|$|An early {{example of}} <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> having rights to seats at venues was the Royal Albert Hall in London, where about 1,200 of the hall's 5,500 seats were {{provided}} on 999-year leases {{when it opened}} in 1871 to help finance its construction costs, allowing access to most of its music, sporting and other events, subject to an annual service charge. [...] The debentures can be passed on or sold, and the tickets to individual events can be resold if the debenture holder does not wish to attend.|$|E
2500|$|In {{commercial}} practice the term [...] "debenture" [...] typically {{refers to the}} document that evidences a secured debt, although in law the definition may also cover unsecured debts (like any [...] "IOU"). The legal definition is relevant for certain tax statutes, so for instance in British India Steam Navigation Co v IRC Lindley J held that a simple [...] "acknowledgement of indebtedness" [...] was a debenture, which meant that a paper on which directors promised to pay the holder £100 in 1882 and 5% interest each half year was enough, {{and as a result}} subject to pay duty under the Stamp Act 1870. The definition depends on the purpose of the statutory provision for which it is used. It matters because <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> have the right to company accounts and the director's report, because <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> must be recorded on a company register which other <b>debenture</b> <b>holders</b> may inspect, and when issued by a company, debentures are not subject to the rule against [...] "clogs on the equity of redemption". This old equitable rule was a form of common law consumer protection, which held that if a person contracted for a mortgage, they must always have the right to pay off the debt and get full title to their property back. The mortgage agreement could not be turned into a sale to the lender, and one could not contract for a perpetual period for interest repayments. However, because the rule limited on contractual freedom to protect borrowers with weaker bargaining power, it was thought to be inappropriate for companies. In Kreglinger v New Patagonia Meat and Cold Storage Co Ltd the House of Lords held that an agreement by New Patagonia to sell sheepskins exclusively to Kreglinger in return for a £10,000 loan secured by a floating charge would persist for five years even after the principal sum was repaid. The contract to keep buying exclusively was construed to not be a clog on redeeming autonomy from the loan because the rule's purpose was to preclude unconscionable bargains. Subsequently, the clog on the equity of redemption rule as a whole was abolished by what is now section 739 of the Companies Act 2006. In Knightsbridge Estates Trust Ltd v Byrne the House of Lords applied this so that when Knightsbridge took a secured loan of £310,000 from Mr Byrne and contracted to repay interest over 40 years, Knightsbridge could not then argue that the contract should be void. The deal created a debenture under the Act, and so this rule of equity was not applied.|$|E

50|$|In 1992, Leyland DAF Ltd, an English {{member of}} the Dutch group DAF Trucks, granted to Stichting Ofasec a {{mortgage}} debenture to secure a loan, containing a floating charge. In 1993, the DAF group collapsed, and Ofasec appointed administrative receivers, which crystallised the floating charge into a fixed charge. The receivers realised the assets, paid preferential debts, and made interim distributions to Ofasec. £72m remained. In the Netherlands, litigation was ongoing meaning this sum could have been insufficient to meet {{the claims of the}} <b>debenture</b> <b>holder.</b> In 1996, Leyland DAF Ltd entered voluntary liquidation. The liquidator’s costs exceeded the amount realised, but they applied for a declaration that their expenses and pay should come out of the proceeds of the realisation of the assets of Leyland DAF Ltd including those subject to a floating charge.|$|R

Ltd took over the company in the same year. Nine months later the Parker Street premises were destroyed by fire during an air raid, but the company, operating from London offices in Norfolk Street, Strand, son established Government contracts for reproducing maps for Bomber Command, plans for M.I.8, and, after ‘D’ Day, ‘communication maps’ which were collected by the R.A.F. and flown direct to France.|$|R
50|$|In 1869, John Brogden {{died and}} {{his eldest son}} Alexander Brogden came to Tondu {{to take charge of}} the {{business}}. In 1872 Alexander formed a new joint-stock company, the Llynvi, Tondu and Ogmore Coal and Iron Company Limited which merged Brogdens’ Glamorgan business interests with those of the Llynvi Coal and Iron Co. This moved was probably forced - Brogdens' Tywith mine had encroached on the other company's territory and the merger was in lieu of compensation. However the new company was short-lived. The Llynfi company was financed by debentures which could be withdrawn at short notice. A major <b>debenture</b> <b>holder</b> did withdraw making the merged company insolvent. It was wound up by creditors in 1878. The liquidator made a number of attempts to make the business viable until it was taken over by North’s Navigation Collieries (1889) Ltd.|$|R

The machinery for raising capital through debenture is not well articulated in the Companies and Allied Matters Act (CAMA) 1990.
