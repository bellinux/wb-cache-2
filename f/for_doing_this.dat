5|$|Ice had to {{be stored}} at {{multiple}} points between harvesting and its final use by a customer. One method <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> was the construction of ice houses to hold the product, typically either shortly after the ice was first harvested or at regional depots after it had been shipped out. Early ice houses were relatively small, but later storage facilities were the size of large warehouses and contained much larger quantities of ice.|$|E
5|$|The idea {{of using}} atomic {{transitions}} to measure time was first suggested by Lord Kelvin in 1879, although {{it was only in}} the 1930s with the development of Magnetic resonance that there was a practical method <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this.</b> A prototype ammonia maser device was built in 1949 at the U.S. National Bureau of Standards (NBS, now NIST). Although it was less accurate than existing quartz clocks, it served to demonstrate the concept.|$|E

Johnny is seated as the heralded warrior prince with Ro-May as his princess and Adam as a prince. Johnny declares the monarchy to be dissolved and announces that Patusan will operate as a democracy. His reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> is for the people to finally be free of rule, good or evil.|$|E

Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire, to whom he had been married for 13 years, and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection. Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards, which resulted in Headley falling off his bike {{by the side of the}} road. Riverside County, California Sheriff's arrived, and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound. From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City. He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base. Prior to his wife's departure from Gold Base, she was monitored closely day and night by the organization.|$|E
5|$|Many {{attempts}} were made to reconstruct the exact mass of the Roman pound. One method <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> consists in weighing old coins; another uses the fact that Roman weight units were derived from Roman units of length similarly to the way the kilogramme was originally derived from the metre, i.e. by weighing a known volume of water. Nowadays the Roman pound is often given as 327.45g, but one should keep in mind that (apart from the other uncertainties that come with such a reconstruction) the Roman weight standard is unlikely to have remained constant to such a precision over the centuries, and that the provinces often had somewhat inexact copies of the standard. The weight and subdivision of the pound in the Holy Roman Empire was reformed by Charlemagne, but in the Byzantine Empire it remained essentially the same. Since Byzantine coins circulated up to Scandinavia, the old Roman standard continued to be influential through the Middle Ages.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1519, Zwingli {{gave his}} first sermon in Zurich. Deviating from the {{prevalent}} practice of basing a {{sermon on the}} Gospel lesson of a particular Sunday, Zwingli, using Erasmus' New Testament as a guide, began to read through the Gospel of Matthew, giving his interpretation during the sermon, known as the method of lectio continua. He continued to read and interpret the book on subsequent Sundays {{until he reached the}} end and then proceeded in the same manner with the Acts of the Apostles, the New Testament epistles, and finally the Old Testament. His motives <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> are not clear, but in his sermons he used exhortation to achieve moral and ecclesiastical improvement which were goals comparable with Erasmian reform. Sometime after 1520, Zwingli's theological model began to evolve into an idiosyncratic form that was neither Erasmian nor Lutheran. Scholars do not agree on the process of how he developed his own unique model. One view is that Zwingli was trained as an Erasmian humanist and Luther played a decisive role in changing his theology. Another view is that Zwingli did not pay much attention to Luther's theology and in fact he considered it as part of the humanist reform movement. A third view is that Zwingli was not a complete follower of Erasmus, but had diverged from him as early as 1516 and that he independently developed his theology.|$|E

25|$|The {{development}} of homological algebra was closely {{intertwined with the}} emergence of category theory. By and large, homological algebra is the study of homological functors and the intricate algebraic structures that they entail. One quite useful and ubiquitous concept in mathematics is that of chain complexes, which can be studied both through their homology and cohomology. Homological algebra affords the means to extract information contained in these complexes and present it in the form of homological invariants of rings, modules, topological spaces, and other 'tangible' mathematical objects. A powerful tool <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> is provided by spectral sequences.|$|E
25|$|Under this arrangement, however, Inslaw had {{substantial}} difficulty {{demonstrating the}} extent of the enhancements and the use of private funding in their development. It proposed several methods <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> but these were rejected by DOJ as inadequate. Inslaw's attempts to identify the proprietary enhancements and their funding ended when it began installing Promis on the USAO Prime computers in August 1983. By the end of the contract in March 1983, it had completed installing Promis in all 20 of the offices specified in the implementation contract. Since none of the available versions of Promis was compatible with the Department's new Prime computers, Inslaw ported the Vax version, which contained Inslaw's claimed enhancements, to the Prime computers.|$|E

25|$|By 1940, PA 80 was {{extended}} west onto Bigelow Boulevard, Baum Boulevard, and Penn Avenue in Pittsburgh, modern designations of PA 380. By 1960, PA 380 replaced most of PA 80 from Dallas and Penn Avenues in Pittsburgh to Murrysville. On July 15, 1960, PA 380 replaced all of PA 80 from Interstate 479 (now I-579) to Dallas and Penn Avenues. This designation change {{was made to}} reduce the number of concurrent routes in Pittsburgh. The changes took effect a few months later and signs were changed by spring 1961. The reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> was because Interstate 80 was created, so PA 80 was removed so there would not be two Route 80s.|$|E
25|$|Governments use {{different}} kinds of taxes and vary the tax rates. They do this in order to distribute the tax burden among individuals or classes of the population involved in taxable activities, such as the business sector, or to redistribute resources between individuals or classes in the population. Historically, taxes on the poor supported the nobility; modern social-security systems aim to support the poor, the disabled, or the retired by taxes on those who are still working. In addition, taxes are applied to fund foreign aid and military ventures, to influence the macroeconomic performance of the economy (a government's strategy <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> is called its fiscal policy; see also tax exemption), or to modify patterns of consumption or employment within an economy, by making some classes of transaction more or less attractive.|$|E
25|$|Spitting is {{the act of}} {{forcibly}} ejecting saliva {{or other}} substances from the mouth. It is often considered rude and a social taboo {{in many parts of}} the world, including Western countries, where it is frequently forbidden by local laws (as it was thought to facilitate the spread of disease). These laws are generally not strictly enforced. In Singapore, the fine for spitting may be as high as SGD$2,000 for multiple offenses, and one can even be arrested. In some other parts of the world, expectoration is more socially acceptable (even if officially disapproved of or illegal), and spittoons are still a common appearance in some cultures. Some animals, including humans in some cases, use spitting as an automatic defensive move. Camels are well known <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this,</b> though most domestic camels are trained not to.|$|E

In Tekken 2, as in the first tournament, the 20-year-old Nina was once again hired to assassinate the sponsor of the current tournament, Kazuya Mishima. Whether at Kazuya's discretion or Anna's own volition, Anna became a bodyguard for Kazuya, along with Ganryu and Bruce Irvin, who were all charged with Kazuya's protection. Nina was later captured by Mishima Zaibatsu forces and used in Dr. Bosconovitch's cryonics research. Learning about this, Anna volunteered to be another test subject, requesting that she be woken in the future {{at the same time as}} Nina. Her reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> is unknown, but the two most reasonable explanations would be because she didn't want to feel lonely without Nina, and she didn't wanted her sister's age preserved in a cryonic sleep while she herself continues to age.|$|E
25|$|A {{vacuum tube}} {{consists}} {{of two or more}} electrodes in a vacuum inside an airtight enclosure. Most tubes have glass envelopes with a glass-to-metal seal based on kovar sealable borosilicate glasses, though ceramic and metal envelopes (atop insulating bases) have been used. The electrodes are attached to leads which pass through the envelope via an airtight seal. Most vacuum tubes have a limited lifetime, due to the filament or heater burning out or other failure modes, so they are made as replaceable units; the electrode leads connect to pins on the tube's base which plug into a tube socket. Tubes were a frequent cause of failure in electronic equipment, and consumers were expected to be able to replace tubes themselves. In addition to the base terminals, some tubes had an electrode terminating at a top cap. The principal reason <b>for</b> <b>doing</b> <b>this</b> was to avoid leakage resistance through the tube base, particularly for the high impedance grid input. The bases were commonly made with phenolic insulation which performs poorly as an insulator in humid conditions. Other reasons for using a top cap include improving stability by reducing grid-to-anode capacitance, improved high-frequency performance, keeping a very high plate voltage away from lower voltages, and accommodating one more electrode than allowed by the base. There was even an occasional design that had two top cap connections.|$|E

Hook thanks Emma, but Emma says that there's no need to. Hook apologizes for what he said on his ship, and when Emma asks if he meant his saying that he didn't love her, or refusing to accept who she now was, {{he says that he}} still did and will always love her.
