" The {{purpose of this study}} was to describe the accounting information system for the provision of credit and the effectiveness of the existing accounting information systems at Danamon Simpan Lending Unit Stone. This study uses interviews and documentary techniques to collect the necessary data and analytical techniques used on stage for the provision of accounting information system that includes the provision of credit and lending requirements, organizational structure in relation to the granting of credit, documents / forms used in the provision of credit, credit <b>granting</b> <b>procedures,</b> and reports generated from lending activities.

50|$|In other words, the <b>grant</b> <b>{{procedure}}</b> {{before the}} EPO is the procedure {{leading to the}} grant of a European patent or to the refusal to grant a European patent. The procedure starts with the filing of an application and ends with the grant of a European patent or the refusal of the patent application by the EPO, or {{the withdrawal of the}} application by the applicant, or its deemed withdrawal. The prosecution of European patent applications until grant typically takes several years.|$|E

5000|$|In the {{international}} procedure {{according to the}} Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), the European Patent Office acts as a Receiving Office, an International Searching Authority (ISA), an International Preliminary Examining Authority (IPEA) and, with effect from 1 July 2010, as a so-called Supplementary International Searching Authority (SISA). The Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) provides an international procedure for handling patent applications, called international applications, during the first 30 months after their first filing in any country party to the PCT. The European Patent Office does not grant [...] "international patents," [...] as such patents do not exist. After 30 months (or, for a few countries, after 20 months) an international application must be converted into national or regional patent applications, and then are subject to national/regional <b>grant</b> <b>procedures.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The European Patent Office (EPO) grants European patents for the Contracting States to the European Patent Convention. The EPO {{provides}} a single patent <b>grant</b> <b>procedure,</b> {{but not a}} single patent {{from the point of}} view of enforcement. Hence the patents granted are not European Union patents or even Europe-wide patents, but a bundle of national patents. Besides granting European patents, the EPO is also in charge of establishing search reports for national patent applications on behalf of the patent offices of France, Netherlands, Belgium, Luxembourg, Italy, Turkey, Greece, Cyprus, Malta, San Marino, Lithuania, Latvia and Monaco.|$|E
50|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>grant</b> <b>procedure,</b> the {{decision}} to grant a European patent takes legal effect only from the day when the European Patent Bulletin mentions the grant. The publication of this mention in the European Patent Bulletin marks the start of the three-month period (or more in some countries, such as Ireland) for supplying the translation of the text in which the European patent has been granted to each national patent office, in order to have an effective protection in each country.

40|$|Software {{patenting}} is {{an increasingly}} important phenomenon in the European Union. Using a novel database of more than 30, 000 software patents granted to both European and Non-European companies, we investigate the relevant factors explaining firm-level software patenting at the European Patent Office. We find that software patents are mainly applied for by American and Japanese firms, that they are characterised by a higher than average length of the <b>granting</b> <b>procedure</b> and that firms belonging to the software sector generally do not apply for them. Finally, results from non-linear panel data estimation reveal that patents are not deemed as useful appropriability instruments by software firms and that a "threat effect" by hardware firms is growing in importance.

50|$|By {{granting}} {{an exclusive}} right, patents provide incentives, offering inventors recognition for their creativity and material reward for their marketable inventions. These incentives encourage innovation, {{which in turn}} contributes to continued enhancement {{of the quality of}} life. In return for the exclusive right, the inventor must adequately disclose the patented invention to the public, so that others have access to the new knowledge, leading to further innovation. The disclosure of the invention is thus an essential consideration in any patent <b>granting</b> <b>procedure.</b> The word “patent”, or “letters patent”, also denotes the document issued by the relevant government authority. In order to obtain a patent for an invention, the inventor, or often the inventor’s employer, submits an application to the national or regional patent office concerned. In the application, the applicant must describe the invention in detail and compare it with previous existing technologies in the same field in order to demonstrate that it is new.|$|R
50|$|Before 1978, two {{important}} problems when seeking to obtain patent protection in Europe {{in a number}} of countries were first the need to file a separate patent application in each country, with a subsequent distinct <b>grant</b> <b>procedure</b> in each country, and secondly the need to translate the text of the application into a number of different languages. Different languages are indeed utilised across the European countries and there is substantial expense in preparing translations into each of those languages. While the European Patent Convention does not totally overcome the need for translations (since a translation may be required after grant to validate a patent in a given EPC Contracting State), it does centralise the prosecution in one language and defers the cost of translations until the time of grant.|$|E
50|$|A European patent is {{the product}} of a unified <b>grant</b> <b>procedure</b> before the European Patent Office (EPO) under {{procedures}} established by the European Patent Convention (EPC). A European patent is a regional, non-unitary patent. Some of the 38 EPC Contracting States require the patentee to file a full translation of the granted European patent with the national patent office of the State if the text of the European patent as granted is not in one of their official languages. If the required translation is not filed, the European patent is deemed to have no effect from the outset in that State. The London Agreement, which entered into force on May 1, 2008, significantly reduces the number of required translations in the 20 states that are party to it.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an empirical {{analysis of the}} determinants of patent litigation in Germany, based on information from suits filed {{during the period from}} 1993 to 1995 at two of the three most important district courts. A control group was formed by selecting a random sample from the population data taken at this period of time. The results of a probit analysis show that relatively valuable patents {{are more likely to be}} involved in litigation cases than the average patent. Patents which have survived opposition are more likely to encounter subsequent litigation actions after the <b>granting</b> <b>procedure</b> than patents which have not been opposed. Patent owner?s ability to trade patents with potential infringers and to interact with them repeatedly appears to promote pretrial settlement and to prevent patentees from filing suits. In contrast to results for the U. S., individual patent owners in Germany were found to be no more likely to face litigation than companies. [...] Patent,Infringement,Litigation,Innovation...|$|R

40|$|In {{the early}} 2000 s, many {{developing}} countries in Eastern Europe, Latin America and Asia presented substantial corporate dollar debts. This paper suggests an explanation for this worrisome phenomenon, which builds on the traditional signaling approach. The model brings into the picture specific institutional characteristics of the credit market in these countries. If lenders have no direct possibility to infer a firm's financial status, sound firms might want to borrow dollars and bear a high clearance cost [...] connected to the <b>grant</b> <b>procedure</b> [...] just in order to signal their type. The success of this policy depends {{on the behavior of}} bad firms. When dollar borrowing clearance costs are relatively small with respect to the clearance cost of borrowing in the local currency, the whole corporate sector would opt for liability dollarization. In this most inefficient case, the signaling effect vanishes, while all firms bear high clearance costs. We also put forward the necessary conditions for a separating equilibrium to occur. ...|$|E
