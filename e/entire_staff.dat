Hampered by injuries, the team lost all of its games in 1955, and calls intensified for Saban's firing as the season wore on. In December, Saban and his <b>entire</b> <b>staff</b> were fired by new athletic director Stu Holcomb. Ara Parseghian was named as his replacement.|$|E

The rest of the staff, particularly Jim and Dwight, watch their new boss's outburst with concern.|$|E

Four days after their game against Mississippi State, Rich Rodriguez was fired along with his <b>entire</b> <b>staff</b> after failing to meet expectations, as well as failing to defeat rivals Ohio State and Michigan State during his three seasons as head coach. Michigan {{immediately}} launched a national coaching search, and hired Brady Hoke as its new head coach one week later.

On board, the anarchists played music, gave lectures, staged plays and even published a revolutionary newspaper, The Float.

5|$|In 1938, Plaek Pibulsonggram, as President of Chulalongkorn University, {{assigned}} ML Pin {{the duty}} of overseeing the establishment of Chulalongkorn's University Preparatory School according to the National Education Plan of BE 2479 (1936 CE). Although given a tight time frame of only three months, the new school was created on the location of Horwang School, and gradually absorbed the older school, the <b>entire</b> <b>staff</b> merging within a few years. ML Pin became the first director of the school, the country's first coeducational school, now known as Triam Udom Suksa School. It {{is widely regarded as}} one of the best schools in the country. During his term as director, which lasted until 1944, he developed and implemented a fixed class schedule system, along with a mechanical timetable used to assign teaching periods, which is still in use today.|$|E
5|$|While Rand Miller stated Cyan {{would not}} make another sequel to Myst, Mattel (then {{the owner of the}} Myst franchise) offered the task of {{developing}} a sequel to several video game companies who created detailed story proposals and technology demonstrations. Presto Studios, makers of the Journeyman Project adventure games, was hired to develop Myst III. Presto spent millions developing the game and used the studio's <b>entire</b> <b>staff</b> to complete the project, which took {{two and a half years}} to develop. Soon after Myst III: Exile was released, Presto was shut down, and Exile publisher Ubisoft developed the sequel, Myst IV: Revelation, internally. Meanwhile, Cyan produced the spinoff title , which included an aborted multiplayer component allowing players to cooperatively solve puzzles.|$|E
5|$|Muramasa was {{worked on}} by 16 people, {{over half the}} <b>entire</b> <b>staff</b> of Vanillaware, {{including}} Kamitani as the game's writer. The Wii {{was chosen as the}} game's platform of release as its specs were fairly close to that of the PlayStation 2, the console for which Odin Sphere was developed. This meant that the team could carry over their earlier experience rather than start from scratch learning about new hardware. Kamitani did create design proposals for versions on the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, but went undeveloped due to budget limitations. Using the Wii's motion controls was tested by the team, but due to the game's old-fashioned style there was little need to implement them. The biggest problem when developing for the Wii was the graphics, especially how to get the various pieces of artwork in the game's scenery to interact and respond properly. They also wanted to keep loading times down to a minimum, which was made possible due to the Wii's area pre-loading abilities. Technical tinkering of this kind went on until the end of development. The game's programmer was Kentaro Ohnishi, whose biggest challenge was creating a battle system which allowed for cancelling of attacks, while maintaining the appearance of smooth attack animation. The resultant code looked so strange that another programmer thought it was a fault and deleted it, forcing Ohnishi to rebuild it. The team was highly dedicated {{to the success of the}} project, putting a large amount of work to make it as good as it could be for players. By the time of release, funds for the company had been drained.|$|E
