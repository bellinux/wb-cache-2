40|$|Distance {{education}} {{has the ability}} to transcend distance and time, reaching students anywhere at any time, particularly those underrepresented in engineering. Engineering is a practice-oriented profession requiring an interweaving of scientific theory and applied hands-on activities. Despite the need for distance education in engineering, few studies have systematically investigated the impact of student achievement and attitude in distance engineering laboratories. This quasi-experimental research addressed that need by studying the cognitive and affective domains of achievement in engineering laboratories while employing computer-based and traditional oscilloscopes. The students from two courses, electrical engineering for nonmajors and <b>electronic</b> <b>fundamentals,</b> were randomly assigned into treatment and comparison groups.

40|$|AbstractNowadays, {{the use of}} {{technology}} to improve teaching and learning experiences in the classroom has been promoted. One of these technologies is augmented reality, which allows overlaying layers of virtual information on real scene with the aim of increasing the perception the user has of reality. In the educational context augmented reality have proved to offer several advantages, i. e. increasing learning engagement and increasing understanding of some topics, especially when spatial skills are involved. Contents deployed in an augmented reality application are of two types, static, i. e. text, or dynamic, i. e. animations. As far as we know no research project has assessed how the type of content, static or dynamic, can affect the student learning experience in augmented reality applications. In this article the development and evaluation of an augmented reality application using static and dynamic content is described. In order to determine how the type of content affects the learning experience of the student, an experimental design in which the student interact with the application, using static and dynamic contents, for learning topics related with an <b>electronic</b> <b>fundamentals</b> course was performed...|$|E
40|$|Teaching Fundamentals of Electronics allow {{students}} to familiarize with basic electronics concepts, acquire skills {{in the use of}} multi-meter test instrument, and develop mastery in testing basic electronic components. Actual teaching and doing observations during practical activities on components pin identification and testing showed that the lack of skills of new students in testing components can lead to incorrect fault diagnosis and wrong pin connection during in-circuit replacement of the defective parts. With the aim of reinforcing students with concrete understanding of the concepts of components applied in the actual test and measurement, a Computer-Based Training was developed. The proponent developed the learning modules (courseware) utilizing concept mapping and storyboarding instructional design. Developing a courseware as simulated, activity-based and interactive as possible was the primary goal to resemble the real-world process. A Local area network (LAN) -based learning management system was also developed to use in administering the learning modules. The Paired Sample T-Test based on the pretest and post-test result was used to determine whether the students achieved learning after taking the courseware. The result revealed that there is a significant achievement of the students after studying the learning module. The E-learning content was validated by the instructors in terms of contents, activities, assessment and format with a grand weighted mean of 4. 35 interpreted as Sufficient. Based from the evaluation result, supplementing with the proposed computer-based training can enhance the teachinglearning process in <b>electronic</b> <b>fundamentals...</b>|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{represents}} a step towards the detailed {{comprehension of the}} photoisomerization processes and their exploitation. State-of-the-art ab initio quantum chemical calculations {{will be used to}} achieve various objectives. When a molecule undergoes an excitation to an higher electronic energy level, one of the main features to study is the way followed by the molecule to relax back on the <b>electronic</b> <b>fundamental</b> state. This implies the computation of the molecular structures where radiationless deactivation is most probable: conical intersections and singlet/triplet crossings. Such crossings provide effective channels for the radiationless deactivation to the ground state. During the last fifteen years the quantum chemical methods mentioned above have been successfully applied to the investigation of the mechanism of both the internal conversion and photochemical transformation of isolated molecules. First objective of this thesis is about retinal chromophores and the relationship between their structure and the ultrafastness and stereospecificity of the photoisomerization in the protein environment. The acquired experience will be used to investigate for possible applications of molecules that can undergo a cis-trans photoisomerization. In fact, the second objective of this thesis is the study of a chromophore, N-methylthioacetammide (NMTAA), model for a thio-substituted peptide bond. The last part of the thesis, and its third objective, is committed to the development of new tools for the geometry optimization of potential energy surfaces crossings, with high level ab initio computations...|$|R

In this work, various substrates such as PMMA, bare silicon oxide, passivated silicon oxide, and silicon nitride were used to fabricate multi-layer InSe FET devices. Through back gating and Hall measurement in four-probe configuration, the devices' field effect mobility and intrinsic Hall mobility were extracted at various temperatures to study the material's intrinsic transport behavior and the effect of dielectric substrate.
