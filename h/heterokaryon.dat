40|$|High {{yields of}} mouse macrophage-melanocyte <b>heterokaryons</b> and macrophage-macrophage homokaryons were {{obtained}} through the virus-induced fusion of cells spread on a glass surface. After fusion {{there was a}} striking reorganization of cellular architecture {{by means of a}} colcemid-sensitive process. <b>Heterokaryons</b> were isolated through the use of differential trypsinization and many underwent division to form melanocyte-like hybrids. The selective uptake of dextran sulfate by macrophages served as a useful cytoplasmic marker in identifying hybrids. Many characteristic macrophage properties were altered in the <b>heterokaryons.</b> Within an hour of fusion macrophage nuclei became swollen, nucleoli were more prominent, and increased nuclear RNA synthesis occurred. 3 hr after fusion, a wave of DNA synthesis took place in the previously dormant macrophage nuclei. The fate of typical macrophage markers was examined in both <b>heterokaryons</b> and homokaryons. Macrophage homokaryons continued to exhibit active phagocytosis of sensitized erythrocytes, whereas this capacity was lost irreversibly in <b>heterokaryons.</b> The loss of phagocytic activity of <b>heterokaryons</b> occurred at an exponential rate and was accelerated by high concentrations of calf serum. Another macrophage surface marker, a divalent cation-dependent adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase), could be demonstrated histochemically on <b>heterokaryons.</b> Shortly after fusion, it was present in discrete regions, but it became more diffuse and disappeared within a day. Acid phosphatase-positive secondary lysosomes and retractile lipid droplets disappeared from <b>heterokaryons</b> but continued to accumulate in macrophage homokaryons.

Reactivation of CE nuclei was associated with marked changes in nuclear antigenicity. In rat myoblast and HeLa <b>heterokaryons</b> the CE nuclei acquired mammalian nucleoplasmic and nuclear envelope antigens in the corresponding nuclear subcompartments.

40|$|The heterokaryotic and {{vegetative}} diploid {{phases of}} Magnaporthe grisea, a fungal pathogen of grasses, have been characterized. Prototrophic <b>heterokaryons</b> form when complementary auxotrophs are paired on minimal medium. Hyphal tip cells and conidia (vegetative spores) taken from these <b>heterokaryons</b> are auxotrophs with phenotypes identical {{to one or}} the other of the parents.

In fast-growing sectors, most hyphal tip cells are unstable prototrophs. The conidia collected from fast-growing sectors include stable and unstable prototrophs, as well as auxotrophs that exhibit a wide range of phenotypes, including many recombinant classes. Genetic linkage in meiosis has been detected between two auxotrophic mutations that recombine in vegetatively growing unstable diploids. The appearance of recombinants suggests that homologous recombination occurs during vegetative growth of M. grisea. No interstrain barriers to heterokaryosis and diploid formation have been detected.
