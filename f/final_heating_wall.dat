The applied modelling and numerical methods enable a full {{representation of the}} liquid and vapour two-phase mixture behaviour on the heated surface, with included prediction of the swell level and <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> temperature field. In this way the integral behaviour of nucleate pool boiling is simulated. The micro conditions of bubble generation at the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> surface are modelled by the bubble nucleation site density, the liquid wetting contact angle and the bubble grow time. The bubble nucleation sites are randomly located within zones of equal size, where the number of zones equals the nucleation site density. The conjugate heat transfer from the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> to the liquid is {{taken into account in}} wetted <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> areas around bubble nucleation sites. The boiling curve relation between the heat flux and the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> surface temperature in excess of the saturation temperature is predicted for the pool boiling conditions reported in the literature and a good agreement is achieved with experimentally measured data. The influence of the nucleation site density on the boiling curve characteristic is confirmed. In addition, the influence of the heat flux intensity on the spatial effects of vapour generation and two-phase flow are shown, such as the increase of the swell level position and the reduced wetting of the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> surface by the heat flux increase.

We consider the case when both the vortex ring and the thermal boundary layer generated by the vertical <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> are stable and laminar prior to any interaction.

(i) A ring-driven stage, where the vortex ring grows in diameter while approaching the wall and therefore it sweeps progressively an increased surface on the wall. (ii) A boundary layer-driven stage, where the vortex ring moves upward due to the thermal convective motion generated by the <b>heated</b> <b>wall.</b> In some cases, the head-on collision triggers the ring's azimuthal instability as revealed by the formation of vortical structures arranged on a wavy starlike pattern and confirmed by flow visualizations.

Results show that the augmentation of Richardson number causes heat transfer to increase, as the heat transfer decreases by the increment of Hartmann number for various Richardson numbers and the directions of the magnetic field. The highest decline of heat transfer on the linearly <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> was found at θ= 0 ° for Richardson numbers of Ri= 100 and Ha= 100.

40|$|Space {{agencies}} worldwide {{are being}} {{confronted with the}} challenges of more distant manned space missions, which will demand greater energy efficiency and reduced weight and volume. One method being considered to reduce the weight and volume is to replace present single-phase Thermal Control Systems (TCSs) with ones that rely on flow boiling and condensation. This transition will require {{a thorough understanding of}} the influence of reduced gravity on flow boiling and condensation, and the development of predictive tools for both. The primary {{purpose of the present study}} is to investigate the impact gravitational body force effects have on flow boiling heat transfer performance and critical heat flux (CHF). Two flow boiling investigations will be presented, where experimentation was conducted both on-ground and in microgravity conditions. ^ The terrestrial-based study explores the mechanism of flow boiling CHF for FC- 72 in a rectangular channel fitted along one side with a <b>heated</b> <b>wall.</b> The flow is supplied as a two-phase mixture and the channel is tested at different orientations relative to Earth 2 ̆ 7 s gravity. High-speed video imaging is used to identify the complex flow boiling CHF trigger mechanism for different orientations, mass velocities and inlet qualities. It is shown that orientation has a significant influence on CHF for low mass velocities and small inlet qualities, with the orientations surrounding horizontal flow with downward-facing <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> causing stratification of the vapor towards the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> and yielding very small CHF values. High mass velocities cause appreciable diminution in the influence of orientation on CHF, which is evidenced by similar flow patterns and CHF trigger mechanism regardless of orientation. The Interfacial Lift-off Model is shown to predict the influence of orientation on CHF with good accuracy. Overall, this study points to the effectiveness of high mass velocities at combating buoyancy effects and helping produce CHF values insensitive to orientation. ^ It is also shown that the influence of orientation can be negated by simultaneously satisfying three separate criteria: overcoming the influence of gravity perpendicular to the <b>heated</b> <b>wall,</b> overcoming the influence of gravity parallel to the <b>heated</b> <b>wall,</b> and ensuring that the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> is sufficiently long to endure liquid contact. These criteria are combined to determine the minimum mass velocity required to negate gravity effects in both terrestrial and space applications. Exceeding this minimum is of paramount importance to space systems since it enables the implementation of the vast body of published CHF data, correlations and models developed from terrestrial studies for design of thermal management systems for space applications. ^ This study also investigates the interfacial phenomena preceding the occurrence of CHF for flow boiling with a finite inlet vapor void. Temporal records of the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> temperatures are used to track the complex transient response of the <b>heated</b> <b>wall,</b> and identify differences between temperature excursions associated with momentary localized dryout and those with true CHF. It is shown that the flow enters the channel fully separated, with a liquid layer sheathing all four channel walls surrounding a central vapor core. At high heat fluxes, a wavy vapor layer begins to form beneath the liquid layer adjacent to the <b>heated</b> <b>wall,</b> and cooling is provided mostly though wetting fronts associated with the wave troughs in accordance with the Interfacial Lift-off Model. However, depending on mass velocity, inlet quality and flow orientation, conditions may arise that cause breakup of the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> liquid layer into ligaments that are entrained in the vapor core. This phenomenon causes localized dryout and wall temperature excursions at heat fluxes well below CHF, but the wall is able to recover from these excursions by a combination of reattachment of ligaments with the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> and lateral <b>heat</b> conduction within the wall itself. Recommendations are made concerning construction of the <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> and CHF detection in pursuit of reliable CHF data. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 8 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, Mauritius, 11 - 13 July, 2011. Natural convective flow through a vertical plane channel has been considered. Both of the <b>heated</b> <b>walls</b> are kept at the same temperature. These <b>heated</b> <b>walls</b> have sharp-edged wavy surfaces. Conditions under which both laminar and turbulent flow exists in the channel have been considered. Now using a wavy <b>heated</b> <b>wall</b> can increase the heat transfer rate in external natural convective flows. Using wavy <b>heated</b> <b>walls</b> in vertical channel flows could therefore potentially also increase the heat transfer rate. However the added flow resistance resulting from the wall waviness will normally decrease the flow through the channel which would tend to decrease the heat transfer rate from the <b>heated</b> <b>walls.</b> Therefore a need existed to examine what effect the wall waviness does have on the heat transfer rate in natural convective flow through a vertical channel and it was {{for this reason that}} the present study was undertaken. The flow has been assumed to be steady and the Boussinesq approximation has been adopted. The basic k-epsilon turbulence model with the effects of the buoyancy forces fully accounted for has been used. The solution has the Rayleigh number, the Prandtl number, the ratio of channel width to the heated channel height, the ratio of the amplitude of the wall waviness to the heated channel height, and the ratio of the pitch of the wall waviness to the heated channel height as parameters. Results have only been obtained for a Prandtl number of 0. 74 (the value for air at temperatures near ambient) and for a single value of the dimensionless pitch of the wall waviness. This leaves the Rayleigh number, the width to heated height ratio of the channel, and the amplitude of the wall waviness to the heated channel height ratio as parameters. Results have been obtained for a range of values of these parameters and the effect of these parameters on the mean Nusselt number has been studied. pm 201...|$|R
