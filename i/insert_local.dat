50|$|Barter {{deals are}} usually for new {{untested}} shows or older shows. In {{this type of}} deal, distributors get {{a fraction of the}} advertisement revenue in exchange for their program. For example, in a 7/5 deal the producer gets seven minutes of advertising time, leaving five minutes for the station to <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> as well as national advertisements.|$|E

50|$|Live {{programmes}} initially ran between 0700 - 1900, {{with the}} Supergold service from the Chiltern Radio Network overnight. The station increased local hours to 2100 {{a few months}} after going on air. Maldwyn was the only station outside the Chiltern-owned stations that made full use of the automation service available on Supergold to <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> news, commercials and features within network programming. Maldwyn broadcast the Network News service provided by Chiltern Radio before switching to IRN when Network News closed.|$|E

5000|$|The service {{formally}} {{shut down}} operations on December 31, 2008. While {{some of its}} affiliates switched to other networks, the remaining affiliates received a computer-updated loop of satellite/radar images, current weather conditions and temperatures, and daily forecasts for major {{regions of the country}} - operating under the unofficial brand, [...] "NBC Plus". This option allowed the equipment that had been used to <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> content onto the former national feed of NBC Weather Plus to remain in use. The network's forecast system and maps continued to be used until 2010 for studio segments on CNBC and MSNBC, with Weather Channel branding along the top-third banner, before being replaced entirely with graphics used by The Weather Channel by mid-2010 (the graphics system used for Weather Plus's national feed remains in use on NBC's Early Today [...] ).|$|E

At its rollout in 1998, it came months after a major update to the channel's on-air presentation. The Star XL was a major leap over the much older Weather Star 4000 system, featuring advanced capabilities such as transitions, moving icons, cloud wallpaper backgrounds and reading the local forecast contents. The WeatherStar XL first appeared in a beta roll-out on select cable systems in November 1998 and appeared briefly on The Weather Channel Latin America until that channel's demise.|$|E
50|$|PBS {{has also}} {{restructured}} its satellite feed system, simplifying PBS-DT2 into a timeshift feed for the Pacific Time Zone, {{rather than a}} high-definition complement to its formerly primary SD feed. PBS Kids Go! was proposed as a replacement broadcast network for PBS Kids Channel, however, plans to launch the network were folded in 2006. Programming from the PBS Satellite Service has also been carried by certain member stations or regional member networks as a placeholder feed to fill their overnight schedules (particularly those that have transitioned to a 24-hour schedule since the late 1990s), in lieu of providing their own programming sourced by outside public television distributors and repeats of local programming (program promotions shown on the satellite feed advertise upcoming programs as being aired on PBS during the timeslot card normally used as a placeholder for member outlets to <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> airtime information during their station breaks).|$|E

50|$|The {{majority}} of television stations in Mexico are operated as repeaters {{of the networks}} they broadcast. Translator stations in the Mexico are given callsigns which begin with XE and XH. Televisa and Azteca each maintain two networks with national reach. Televisa's Canal de las Estrellas network includes 128 separately licensed stations, the most in Mexico, while Azteca's networks incorporate 88 and 91 stations. These stations may {{have the capability to}} <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> advertising. Azteca's stations in larger cities may include local news and a limited amount of regional content; Televisa prefers to use its non-national Gala TV network and Televisa Regional stations as outlets for its local production. On top of the listed number of transmitters for each network, many have multiple translators of their own that serve areas with little or no signal within their defined coverage area, known as equipos complementarios de zona de sombra ("shadow channels"). Most shadow channels air the same programming as their parent station, with several notable exceptions. The northern and central regional network Multimedios Televisión out of Monterrey uses the same sort of system to a smaller extent, but mainly offers regional outputs for local newscasts and advertising formed around a master schedule.|$|E
5000|$|Local {{commercial}} (and some non-commercial) broadcast {{television stations}} also <b>insert</b> <b>local</b> commercial breaks during programming each half-hour while network-supplied or syndicated content is being broadcast. Television networks and syndication distributors give their affiliates either 60, 90 or 120 seconds each half-hour (typically totaling about four minutes per hour) to run local station breaks, including promos for {{the station and}} advertisements for national and local area businesses (and on a few stations, local news updates - which were particularly common during the 1970s through the 1990s, especially as the [...] "24 Hour News Source" [...] format became commonplace in the United States during the latter decade - current time and temperature information, or a brief local weather forecast), over network programming. Typically, these networks air a blank feed showing the network's logo (such as with Fox, NBC and The CW) or a series of public service announcements (as with ABC and CBS), while stations air local commercials. PBS member stations and other non-commercial educational stations also insert promos for network series and/or syndicated or locally produced programming during promo breaks; as these station are non-commercial, breaks are typically not featured during the programs themselves, instead promos are inserted in-between shows, even - {{in the case of}} PBS members - if the station is carrying the national network feed.|$|E

We focused our research in a local broadcasting station of the Rede Brasil Sul de Comunicações, affiliated to Rede Globo in Brazil. The broadcasting station is located in the countryside of Rio Grande do Sul state. Besides having a decentralized editorial production policy, with reporters and studio away from its headquarters, the local broadcasting station uses its commercial break to present contents produced by itself. These contents match the identities currently adopted by micro-regional audience. To illustrate this practice, we take as an example a production that has been broadcasted for the last five years. Its subject can be described as the ancestors memory preservation through the maintenance and restoration of the architectural patrimony, as well as the narratives associated with it...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Considering {{different}} {{industrial applications}} an experimental investigation {{has been carried}} out for turbulent flow in a circular tube with perforated x-shaped inserts with perforations of 0. 0 %, 5. 7 %, 10. 15 % and 15. 87 %. Air velocities, air temperatures, tube wall temperatures were collected to analyze the surface or wall temperature and the bulk temperature distribution for the plain tube {{as well as for the}} tube with inserts. Temperature distribution profile is a dominant factor for overall heat transfer performance and to alter that profile inserts with different perforations were used. The results indicated that local surface temperature decreases with the increasing Reynolds number at corresponding point on each tube surface and the average surface temperature for tubes with perforated inserts is 1. 03 - 1. 25 times lower than smooth tube and about 1. 15 times lower than the tube with imperforated insert and it is much lower for insert with porosity, R p= 15. 87 %. For tubes with perforated <b>insert,</b> <b>local</b> bulk temperature at each corresponding point is about 1. 01 - 1. 18 fold compared to smooth tube and about 1. 01 - 1. 05 fold compared to the tube with imperforated insert and local bulk temperature distribution along the length of test section is higher for insert with porosity, R p= 15. 87 %.
