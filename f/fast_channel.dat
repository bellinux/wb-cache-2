5000|$|Biyaadhoo or Biyadhoo is a {{circular}} ten-acre resort-island in South Malé Atoll in the administrative division Kaafu Atoll of the Maldives. The island is located 18 {{miles south of}} Malé International Airport. It is located 0.62 miles from the island of Makunufushi, and only 330 yards from another resort-island, Villivaru. Both Biyaadhoo- and Villivaru islands are owned and managed by the Taj group from India. It is mostly made up by the Biyadhoo Island Resort, but remains a densely vegetated and forested island. The rich soil allows the cultivation of various fruits and vegetables, e.g. numerous coconut-, banana-, and mango trees grow on the island. Experts here have also been employed in growing vegetables hydroponically, some of the vegetables grown on the island includes tomatoes, cabbage, and cucumbers used by the resort in preparation of various buffets. There is one resort, a restaurant, spa, and one bar located on the island, all which are parts of the resort. There is also evening entertainment for guests several times aweek.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Most {{congenital}} myasthenic syndromes (CMS) have postsynaptic defects from mutations {{within the}} muscle acetylcholine receptor (AChR). Mutations underlying the slow channel syndrome cause a "gain of function" and usually show dominant inheritance, whereas mutations underlying AChR deficiency or the <b>fast</b> <b>channel</b> syndrome cause a "loss of function" and show recessive inheritance. OBJECTIVE: To characterize the disease mechanism underlying an apparently dominantly inherited CMS that responds to IV edrophonium. METHODS: DNA from CMS patients was analyzed for mutations by single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, DNA sequence analysis, and restriction endonuclease digestion. Functional analysis of mutations was by alpha-bungarotoxin binding studies and by patch clamp analysis of mutant AChR expressed in human embryonic kidney cells. RESULTS: Analysis of muscle biopsies from {{father and son}} in an affected kinship showed normal endplate morphology and AChR number but severely reduced miniature endplate potentials. DNA analysis revealed that each harbors a single missense mutation in the AChR alpha-subunit gene, alphaF 256 L. Expression studies demonstrate this mutation underlies a <b>fast</b> <b>channel</b> phenotype with fewer and shorter ion channel activations. The major effect of alphaF 256 L, located within the M 2 transmembrane domain, is on channel gating, both reducing the opening and increasing the closure rate. CONCLUSIONS: Mutation alphaF 256 L results in <b>fast</b> <b>channel</b> kinetics. Expression studies suggest a dominant-negative effect within the AChR pentamer, severely compromising receptor function...|$|E
40|$|Congenital myasthenic syndromes (CMS) {{result from}} the failure to achieve muscle {{depolarisation}} due to disorders in the structure and/or function of the neuromuscular synapse. Mutations of the nicotinic acetylcholine receptor (nAChR) form a major subset of CMS. We describe a patient who presented with recurrent apnoeic crises in the neonatal period requiring ventilator support. Electromyography revealed compound muscle action potential decrement upon repetitive stimulation. Sequencing of nAChR subunit genes revealed two missense mutations. One previously reported null mutation p. εTyr 15 His, and a second novel missense mutation, p. εThr 38 Lys, that is well expressed in mammalian cell culture and thus likely to exert its effect via alteration of ion channel kinetics. Functional analysis revealed abbreviated ion channel bursts characteristic of a <b>fast</b> <b>channel</b> CMS. The mutation p. εThr 38 Lys occurs at the interface between the α and ε subunits of the nAChR pentamer and leads to instability of the open channel. The effects of this mutation on channel function were investigated {{in relation to other}} <b>fast</b> <b>channel</b> mutants at an analogous subunit interface within the nAChR pentamer. <b>Fast</b> <b>channel</b> syndromes are frequently characterised by severe myasthenic weakness with apnoeic crises; knowledge of the underlying mutation and its functional consequences can be vital for appropriate therapy and patient management. © 2013 Elsevier B.

40|$|Nav 1. 2 and Nav 1. 6 are two {{voltage-gated}} {{sodium channel}} isoforms that are {{abundant in the}} adult central nervous system. These channels are expressed in different cells and localized in different neuronal regions, which may reflect functional specialization. To examine this possibility, we compared the properties of Nav 1. 2 and Nav 1. 6 {{in response to a}} rapid series of repetitive depolarizations. Currents through Nav 1. 6 coexpressed with β 1 demonstrated use-dependent potentiation during a rapid train of depolarizations. This potentiation was in contrast to the use-dependent decrease in current for Nav 1. 2 with β 1. The voltage dependence of potentiation correlated with the voltage dependence of activation, and it still occurred when fast inactivation was removed by mutation. Rapid stimulation accelerated a slow phase of activation in the Nav 1. 6 <b>channel</b> that had <b>fast</b> inactivation removed, resulting in <b>faster</b> <b>channel</b> activation. Although the Nav 1. 2 <b>channel</b> with <b>fast</b> inactivation removed also demonstrated slightly <b>faster</b> activation, that <b>channel</b> showed very pronounced slow inactivation compared to Nav 1. 6.
