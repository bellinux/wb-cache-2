5|$|We {{need people}} like , he fights the fight... He {{refused to take}} his anti-retroviral {{medication}} unless it was made affordable and available to everyone—a hugely courageous thing to do. Before then, I'd been frustrated because I wanted to be more hands-on. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> that TAC are doing it where it needs to happen. It really needed to be given support, and I thought that perhaps I might be well-placed to do it.|$|E
5|$|I fell in {{love with}} him as a ten-year-old boy. I saw him in a play in New York... a very well-staged melodrama which was an {{enormous}} hit for about a year—it was made as a movie later with somebody else. He had the leading role, and I never forgot him. And through the years I'd seen him in movies—little things. And I could never forget that performance of his. He's always played very stereotyped parts in pictures but is one of the best actors I've ever known. I have such respect for him. You play next to him and you <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> the thing that you do with a big actor—this dynamo going on.|$|E

According to Thornton, [...] "I'm one of those artists that people take my music without my consent. People love to snatch my music and do things on their own. You got people that put me on beats I never rapped on. I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> that it's a bad thing." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{sound is}} {{perceived}} as louder than it actually is; sound designer Gary Rydstrom explains that, [...] "from a technical standpoint, 'Deep Note' <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> loud {{because it has a}} spectrum of frequencies that grows from small to large." ...|$|R

500|$|On September 21, Brian {{completed}} the track after Tanner added a final Electro-Theremin overdub. In 1976 he elaborated on the event: [...] "It was at Columbia. I remember I {{had it right}} in the sack. I could <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it when I dubbed it down, made the final mix from the 16-track down to mono. It was a feeling of power, it was a rush. A feeling of exaltation. Artistic beauty. It was everything ... I remember saying, 'Oh my God. Sit back and listen to this!'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> {{like this}} record is really different- youve got club bangers to more 70s glam to more singer-songwriter records to rock music. [...] The Fame {{is not about}} who you are—it's about how {{everybody}} wants to know who you are! Buy it and listen to it before you go out or in the car. [...] I think you've really got to allow artists' creativity to marinate. It took me a while but really delving into myself I finally got it. I couldn't be more proud of it. It's not just a record it's a whole pop art movement It's not just about one song." ...|$|E

And it meant a lot for me to do this." [...] While reviewing the deluxe edition of B'Day, Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine praised the song, saying that it [...] "sound downright subtle".|$|E
500|$|Charlie's {{understanding}} of the world is depicted as omniscient, as when he asks Barton about [...] "the two lovebirds next door", {{despite the fact that they}} are several doors away. When Barton asks how he knows about them, Charlie responds: [...] "Seems like I hear everything that goes on in this dump. Pipes or somethin'." [...] His total awareness of the events at the Earle demonstrate the kind of understanding needed to show real empathy, as described by Audrey. This theme returns when Charlie explains in his final scene: [...] "Most guys I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> sorry for. Yeah. It tears me up inside, to think about what they're going through. How trapped they are. I understand it. I feel for 'em. So I try to help them out." ...|$|E
5000|$|... “Vicki” is wonderfully infectious! The {{music is}} great and engaging.

500|$|The book {{notes the}} artist's {{reluctance}} {{to be interviewed}} or engage with the public, and quotes him as saying: [...] "It's {{very hard for me}} to relate to people asking questions that are not only boring but don't {{have anything to do with}} my life ... It's a waste of time on my part because it drains me from doing what I really want to do, which is just to play music." [...] Van Morrison describes his perceived musical role: [...] "I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> I'm doing the job. My job is to play music and deliver the show ... It's more emotional for the audience ... what they sort of think you are." [...] He states that one of his motivations is [...] "ideally to induce states of meditation and ecstasy, as well as to make people think".|$|E
500|$|... "Feeling This" [...] was {{the first}} track that was {{recorded}} for Blink-182 in early 2003. On {{the first day of}} pre-production on the album, bassist Mark Hoppus asked an engineer to explain Pro Tools to him, as it {{was the first}} time the band would record their music digitally. He began recording guitar and bass parts and experimenting with the software. When guitarist Tom DeLonge and drummer Travis Barker arrived, they too began adding new tracks to the project. The song was written in one day. [...] "I think if I sit there and try to analyze everything, what would be cool here or there, I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> like I get so far away from what I would do, and I think your gut instinct is usually the best thing," [...] said Barker at the time.|$|E

She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her I kind of wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Everything I Shouldn't Be Thinking About" [...] {{is a song}} {{by country}} music duo Thompson Square.

5000|$|In {{terms of}} {{negative}} feedback, reviewer Derek Smith of the Apollo Movie Guide wrote {{that there was}} [...] "not enough substance to Gunny to make him interesting enough to be the central character of a film, and since the movie offers nothing new or fresh, it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> dull and uninteresting." ...|$|R
2500|$|Guitarist Jeff Schroeder also {{hinted that}} the album {{may be less}} heavy than past albums, stating [...] "In this day and age, with what's going on {{politically}} and socially, it <b>just</b> <b>feels</b> right to play something that's a little more spacey and dreamy. We want music to move people on an emotional level." ...|$|R
500|$|In July 2011, Horsfield {{stepped down}} as {{assistant}} manager to concentrate on his coaching qualifications, remaining at Port Vale as a coach. Later in the month he scored in a friendly against Stone Dominoes, but dismissed speculation {{that he would make}} a return to the playing side of the game. In December 2011, loan striker Guy Madjo celebrated his first goal for the club by running over to Horsfield on the touchline, [...] "to say thank you for all the finishing (practice) that we have been doing. He has shown me {{a lot of things that}} I haven't done in the past. In seven years, I have been so many places, to so many clubs and I haven't done that with anyone else, so I <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> it was a good dedication for him." [...] Horsfield retired completely from football in May 2012 to pursue business interests.|$|E
500|$|For {{the song}} [...] "Slaughter", Ndegéocello tried to weave {{together}} sonic influences from the producers Trevor Horn and RZA, {{as well as}} the bands Yes, Sade, and The Human League: [...] "That's what I tried to achieve in this particular recording: some sonic tapestries that people, even if they're not listening to the lyrics, could <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> or hear, or just have a deep, inner dialogue with." [...] She covered Ready for the World's 1986 song [...] "Love You Down", deconstructing it into what Village Voice critic Eugene Holley Jr. described as [...] "a stripper's classic". Songs such as [...] "Mass Transit" [...] and [...] "White Girl" [...] featured Ndegéocello's characteristic ska and reggae influenced basslines; Holley argued that Caribbean riddims and country-rock guitar grooves underpinned the music, serving as a backdrop for Ndegéocello's contralto singing throughout Devil's Halo. In the opinion of Ed Potton from The Times, her voice [...] "resided somewhere between Sade and PJ Harvey".|$|E
500|$|According to Theron Martin, the OVA series School Rumble: Extra Class {{was made}} mostly for devoted fans; {{claiming}} that {{familiarity with the}} series is almost a necessity before watching it, although he later came {{to the view that}} it may also be useful as a sampler of the series. Chris Beveridge gives the OVA series an overall negative review. He did not highlight a single specific reason, instead observing that although all elements that [...] "make the TV series enjoyable are certainly present here, they <b>just</b> <b>feel</b> weaker". However, it did make him want to watch more of the television series, thus serving its intended purpose in keeping interest in the series alive. Katherine Luther endorsed the view that viewers need to be familiar with the story, but reviewed the OVA positively. While she noted lulls in the action, she believes fans will be able to overlook this. Unlike Martin, Luther did not believe the OVA is a good introduction to School Rumble, due to its short sequences and seemingly random nature.|$|E
