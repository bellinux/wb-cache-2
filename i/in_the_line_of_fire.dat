5|$|Eastwood played Frank Horrigan in the Secret Service thriller <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>Line</b> <b>of</b> <b>Fire</b> (1993), {{directed}} by Wolfgang Petersen and co-starring John Malkovich and Rene Russo.

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} teeth involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture, clinically and radiographically, and their associated complications so as to indicate if they should be managed conservatively or extracted. Materials and Methods: Data were collected from patients records treated of mandibular fractures. It was included pre and postoperative panoramic radiographs, information such as demographic data, age, and sex, fracture location, mobility, and vitality <b>of</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture, teeth stabilizing the fracture segment. Results: The sample presented 25 patients with teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> mandibular fractures. A total of 16 patients teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were vital during the 6 th week postoperative follow-up and 9 patients with their teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were nonvital of which 4 were endodontically treated and the rest 5 patients teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture were extracted as they showed signs of infection. Conclusion: This study demonstrated that the presence <b>of</b> teeth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> <b>of</b> fracture is not a limiting factor for the treatment. Despite the risk of complications, tooth <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fracture <b>line</b> should be preserved for its merits. A regular clinical and radiological follow-up should be mandatory for at least a period of 1 year...|$|R
