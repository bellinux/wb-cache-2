50|$|The black-necked, Colombian, silvery, and Junin grebes {{are very}} closely related and were {{formerly}} sometimes separated as the genus Dyas. The <b>great</b> <b>grebe</b> has also sometimes been separated {{as the sole}} member of the genus Podicephorus.|$|E
50|$|The park {{is also a}} birdwatching {{destination}} with sitings of {{the torrent}} duck (pato correntino), the Magellanic woodpecker (carpintero negro), the Chilean pigeon (torcaza), the hued-hued (huet-huet), the Andean condor, the <b>great</b> <b>grebe</b> (huala), the house wren (chercán) and the buff-necked ibis (bandurria).|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>grebe</b> (Podiceps major) is {{the largest}} species of grebe in the world. A disjunct {{population}} exists in northwestern Peru, while the main distribution is from extreme southeastern Brazil to Patagonia and central Chile. The population from southern Chile is considered a separate subspecies, P. m. navasi.|$|E

50|$|Grebes have narrow wings, {{and some}} species are {{reluctant}} to fly; indeed, two South American species are completely flightless. They respond to danger by diving rather than flying, and are in any case much less wary than ducks. Extant species {{range in size from}} the least grebe, at 120 grams (4.3 oz) and 23.5 cm (9.3 inches), to the <b>great</b> <b>grebe,</b> at 1.7 kg (3.8 lbs) and 71 cm (28 inches).|$|E
50|$|The <b>great</b> <b>grebe</b> {{lives on}} a diet mostly of fish, {{sometimes}} over 11 cm (4.3 inches) long, but usually smaller. Prey competition can occasionally occur with the neotropic cormorant over fish, but that species (in spite of smaller body size) usually takes larger fish. Also insects, crustaceans and mollusks are taken. The diet can switch to almost half crabs during the wintertime along the coasts, and these birds can also take the young of other waterbirds, especially coots.|$|E
50|$|A {{total of}} 210 bird species are {{reported}} in this protected area, but a study conducted between 2004 and 2007 reports 58 species (resident or migrant) {{with the possibility of}} finding up to 56 more. Among the birds found in the area are: the white-cheeked pintail, the <b>great</b> <b>grebe,</b> the Andean coot, the Neotropic cormorant, the Peruvian pelican, Franklin's gull, the gray-headed gull, the puna ibis, the black vulture, the Peruvian thick-knee, the black skimmer, the American oystercatcher and Wilson's phalarope.|$|E

50|$|This is a {{very large}} grebe, with {{proportions}} more like a goose or a cormorant then a typical grebe. They range in length from 67-80 cm (26-32 inches) and usually weigh about 1600 grams (3.5 lb), but can scale to at least 2 kg (4.4 lb). They are buffy-rufous on the neck and chest, blackish on the back and have a whitish belly. The head is sooty gray with a reddish-brown eye. Due to its size and unique coloration, the <b>great</b> <b>grebe</b> is unlikely to be confused with any other bird, including other grebes.|$|E
50|$|One of the {{purposes}} of this protected area is to provide a sanctuary for Nearctic migratory birds, as it is a unique habitat on almost 2000 km of coast on the Pacific Ocean.

40|$|The aim of {{the thesis}} was {{monitoring}} abundance and distribution of nests of <b>Great</b> Crested <b>Grebe</b> (Podiceps cristatus) during the season on the Naděje fishpond system. Further observation included factors that could affect nesting success of the <b>Great</b> Crested <b>Grebe.</b> Attention was concentrated on Wild Duck (Anas platyrhynchos) which is bred by man on the fishpond system and might negatively affect nesting success of <b>Great</b> Crested <b>Grebe.</b> Part {{of this study was}} the detailed observation of selected pairs during the nesting season by using camera traps. Temperature measurement in the nests was done by temperature data logger. The investigation was realized on the Naděje fishpond system near the village Frahelž. The research took place from the 14 th of April to the 28 th of October in 2015. In 2015 were found and investigated 37 nests on the Naděje fishpond system. On the fishpond Skutek were monitored 34 nest, on the fishpond Láska 2 nests and on the fishpond Rod only 1 nest. Majority nests (30) were found on a free surface and 7 nests were situated in the bushy vegetation. Parameters of 111 eggs were obtained altogether. On the fishpond Skutek were found 100 eggs, on fishpond Láska 8 eggs and in the only nest on fishpond Rod 3 eggs. Using the camera traps during the observation proved negative effect of wild duck on <b>Great</b> Crested <b>Grebe</b> nesting. The nest was destroyed group of wild duck. The maximum temperature in the nest reached 33, 8 °C...|$|R
