We examine the dynamical evolution of the Earth-Moon system from such initial conÐgurations. We Ðnd that during the early evolution of the system, strong orbital resonances are encountered. Passage through these resonances can excite large lunar orbital eccentricity and modify the inclination of the Moon to the equator. Scenarios that resolve the mutual inclination problem are presented. A period of large lunar eccentricity would result in substantial tidal heating in the early Moon, providing a heat source for the lunar magma ocean.

However, while peak performance of microprocessor-based systems has grown exponentially, the gradual slide in sustained performance delivered to scientific applications has become a growing concern among HEC users. Recently, the Earth Simulator and Cray X 1 /X 1 E parallel vector processor systems have spawned renewed interest in vector technology for scientific applications. In this work, we compare the performance of two lattice-Boltzmann applications and the Cactus astrophysics package on vector based systems including the Cray X 1 /X 1 <b>E,</b> <b>Earth</b> Simulator, and NEC SX- 8, with commodity-based processor clusters including the IBM SP Power 3, IBM Power 5, Intel Itanium 2, and AMD Opteron processors.
