5000|$|<b>Don</b> <b>Gonyea</b> {{has written}} that, [...] "Cain's book, meanwhile, is called This is Herman Cain: My Journey To The White House. His travel {{schedule}} has prompted many {{to wonder if}} it's all really about selling books. Visits to Iowa have been rare instead {{he has been in}} Arkansas, Tennessee, Wisconsin and other places far from the early caucus and primary action. Cain addressed the assertion that his ultimate goal is to land a TV show, like former candidate Mike Huckabee did after his failed 2008 presidential run. [...] "If you know Herman Cain, nothing is further from the truth," [...] Cain said in October. [...] "If you don't believe me, I invite you to get a copy of my new book, This is Herman Cain, if you can find one, because they are selling like hotcakes." [...] Cain made the comments before allegations of past sexual harassment and an awkward answer to a question about Libya that went viral. Any candidate would worry about the impact of such things on a political campaign. But selling oneself as an author or a TV host or commentator is another matter. Constituents there can be much more forgiving." ...|$|E
