For many years, the prospects and problems of providing managers with real-time management information have been discussed and debated (cf., Dearden, 1966).

Now, both technology and business direction are driving information technology management to a fundamentally new paradigm Information technology is no longer exclusive for the <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>specialists.</b> Line business managers increasingly take responsibility for information technology decisions, as computing and telecommunication {{is becoming more and more}} universal.

40|$|Agile manufacturing, fast-response micromarketing, and {{the rise}} of the virtual {{organization}} have led managers to focus on cross-functional business processes that link various divisions and organizations. These processes may be realized as one or more workflows, each of which is an instantiation of a process under certain conditions. Because an ability to adapt processes to workflow conditions is essential for organizational responsiveness, identifying and analyzing significant workflows is an important activity for managers, organization designers, and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>specialists.</b> A variety of software systems have been developed to aid in the structuring and implementation of workflow systems, but they are mostly visualization tools with few analytical capabilities. For example, they do not allow their users to easily determine which information elements are needed to compute other information elements, whether certain tasks depend on other tasks, and how resource availability affects information and tasks. Analyses of this type can be performed by inspection, but this gives rise to the possibility of error, especially in large systems. In this paper, we show how a mathematical construct called a metagraph can be used to represent workflows, so that such questions can be addressed through formal operations, leading to more effective design of organizational processes...|$|R
40|$|Logistics can {{be defined}} as the process of {{strategically}} managing the acquisition, movement, and storage of materials, parts, and finished inventory (and the related information flow) through the organization and its marketing channels in a cost effective manner. It is concerned with delivering the right product to the right customer {{in the right place at}} the right time. The logistics function is composed of inventory management, facilities management, communications unitization, transportation, materials management, and production scheduling. The relationship between logistics and <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> is clear. Systems such as Electronic Data Interchange (EDI), Point of Sale (POS) systems, and Just in Time (JIT) inventory management systems are important elements in the management of product development and delivery. With improved access to market demand figures, logisticians can decrease inventory sizes and better service customer demand. However, without accurate, timely information, little, if any, of this would be feasible in today's global markets. <b>Information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>specialists</b> can learn from logisticians. In a manner similar to logistics management, information logistics is concerned with the delivery of the right data, to the ring customer, at the right time. As such, <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> are integral components of the <b>information</b> logistics <b>system</b> charged with providing customers with accurate, timely, cost-effective, and useful information. Information logistics is a management style and is composed of elements similar to those associated with the traditional logistics activity: inventory management (data resource management), facilities management (distributed, centralized and decentralized <b>information</b> <b>systems),</b> communications (participative design and joint application development methodologies), unitization (input/output system design, i. e., packaging or formatting of the information), transportations (voice, data, image, and video communication systems), materials management (data acquisition, e. g., EDI, POS, external data bases, data entry) and production scheduling (job, staff, and project scheduling) ...|$|R

40|$|Antimicrobial {{resistance}} (AMR) is {{a worldwide}} issue, but with significant epidemiological diversity in different countries. A recently observed phenomenon {{is represented by}} the diffusion of AMR, initially confined to intensive-care units, to medical wards. This was predictable, since patients hospitalized in medical units are made up of more than 70 % of elderly people (over 75 years of age in 1 case out of 2). They are fragile patients, with significant comorbidity (over a half with at least 3 diseases), weakened immune systems, and consequently a higher risk of infection. Given such a scenario, it becomes therefore both necessary and urgent to adopt a multifaceted approach of antimicrobial stewardship programs in order to prevent, detect and control the emergence of antimicrobial resistant organisms. The ideal antimicrobial program is led by an infectious diseases (ID) physician and clinical pharmacist with ID training, together with a list of other important staff: clinical microbiologist, <b>information</b> <b>systems</b> <b>specialist,</b> infection control professional, and hospital epidemiologist. In real life, not all the Italian hospitals have got an ID physician and therefore the best canditates for antimicrobial management practices are internists if provided with a specific expertise in ID and antibiotic therapy. Adhering to the principles of optimal antimicrobial therapy in their clinical practice, the internist is able to improve the care and help to reduce the resistance of a patient at his bedside. At the same time, he can achieve other key goals reducing the length of stay and reducing the cost and utilization of health care resources...|$|R
