5|$|However, more conveniently, {{a pair of}} <b>indices</b> (n,m) is used instead. The <b>indices</b> {{refer to}} equally long unit vectors at 60° angles to each other across a single 6-member carbon ring. Taking the origin as carbon number 1, the a1 unit vector may be {{considered}} the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 3, and the a2 unit vector is then the line drawn from carbon 1 to carbon 5. (See the upper {{right corner of the}} diagram at right.) To visualize a CNT with <b>indices</b> (n,m), draw n a1 unit vectors across the graphene sheet, then draw m a2 unit vectors at a 60° angle to the a1 vectors, then add the vectors together. The line representing the sum of the vectors will define the circumference of the CNT along the plane perpendicular to its long axis, connecting one end to the other. In the diagram at right, Ch is a (4,2) vector: the sum of 4 unit vectors from the origin directly to the right, then 2 unit vectors at a 60° angle down and to the right.|$|E

25|$|This {{applies only}} for {{numerical}} <b>indices.</b> The situation {{is the opposite}} for abstract <b>indices.</b> Then, vectors themselves carry upper abstract <b>indices</b> and covectors carry lower abstract <b>indices,</b> as per the example in the introduction of this article.

40|$|The Malmquist {{productivity}} <b>index</b> {{has many}} attractive features.

40|$|AbstractWe define two {{different}} notions of <b>index</b> for subsemigroups of semigroups: the (right) syntactic <b>index</b> and the Rees <b>index.</b> We investigate {{the relationships between}} them and with the group <b>index.</b> In particular, we show that the syntactic <b>index</b> is a generalisation of both the group <b>index</b> and the Rees <b>index.</b> We use this fact to prove further similarities between the group <b>index</b> and the Rees <b>index.</b> It turns out, however, that {{very few of the}} nice properties of the group <b>index</b> are inherited by the syntactic <b>index...</b>|$|R

25|$|In the {{language}} of tensor algebra, a particular tensor {{is associated with a}} particular shape with many lines projecting upwards and downwards, corresponding to abstract upper and lower <b>indices</b> of tensors respectively. Connecting lines between two shapes corresponds to contraction of <b>indices.</b> One advantage of this notation is that one does not have to invent new letters for new <b>indices.</b> This notation is also explicitly basis-independent.|$|E

25|$|The {{algorithm}} requires as a {{first step}} to sort the sample in ascending order. It then computes the discrete derivative of the sorted list, and finds the <b>indices</b> where this derivative is positive.
