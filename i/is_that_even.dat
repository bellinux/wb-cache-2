5|$|Warren and her {{daughter}} Amelia Tyagi wrote The Two-Income Trap: Why Middle-Class Mothers and Fathers Are Going Broke. Warren and Tyagi point out that a fully employed worker today earns less inflation-adjusted income than a fully employed worker did 30years ago. Although families spend less today on clothing, appliances, and other consumption, the costs of core expenses such as mortgages, health care, transportation, and child care have increased dramatically. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> with two income earners, families are {{no longer able to}} save and have incurred greater and greater debt.|$|E
5|$|Three more eggs {{containing}} embryos {{from the}} same formation were described in 2016 by Wang et al. Though they noted that these eggs strongly resemble M. yaotunensis, they declined to refer them to any ootaxon lower than Elongatoolithidae because Macroolithus is not clearly defined and {{is in need of}} revision. The embryos within these eggs {{are some of the most}} well-preserved of any oviraptorids, providing new information on oviraptorid ontogeny. The specimens show a relatively shallow head which indicates that as oviraptorids matured, their skulls grew dorsoventrally (top-to-bottom) faster than anteroposteriorly (front-to-back). This growth pattern is unusual among theropods, but is also seen in derived ("advanced") tyrannosaurids. Also unusual <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> at this early stage of development, the nasal bones are fused. Coincidentally, tyrannosaurids also show fusion of the nasals early in development.|$|E
25|$|The reality <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> {{though most}} {{organizational}} work processes are largely designed around documentation, much remains unrecorded, especially {{that to do}} with decision-making. The record often reflects the desire to gloss over disagreements and serious questions, or the desire to sell or excuse.|$|E
60|$|Other {{troubles}} too there <b>were</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> {{which made}} all feel <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though Mr. Audley was {{to live to}} himself, his presence in the house would be no small comfort.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{will see}} <b>that</b> the {{marriage}} <b>is</b> not imminent. It may <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> yet {{it will never}} take place. The young lady has refused him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Madam," [...] he replied, [...] "I {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} {{of the young}} lady with whom I <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> at the boarding-house where we both lived." ...|$|R
25|$|Another {{theory is}} that IJ might have arisen from the {{lowercase}} y being split into two strokes in handwriting. At {{some time in the}} 15th or 16th century, this combination began to be spelled as a ligature ij. An argument against this theory <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in handwriting which does not join letters, ij is often written as a single sign.|$|E
25|$|A {{proof of}} the {{politically}} stabilizing effect of the banana boom of the 1950s <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Velasco, who in 1952 was elected president for the third time, managed to serve out a full four-year term. Velasco's fourth term in the presidency initiated a renewal of crisis, instability, and military domination and ended conjecture that the political system had matured or developed in a democratic mold.|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} the differing style of the alliterative {{version of the story}} is the {{treatment}} of Mordred. He is not simply the villain of the piece as he is in other poems but is a complex character with a varying personality. One mark of the prevalence of Christian morality in the poem <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> Mordred cries and seems to be repentant around line 3886.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes, <b>that</b> <b>was</b> Ike. It <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> we disagreed. He scolded me, and I {{answered}} him (you {{must have heard}} us); {{and the next day}} he went away.' ...|$|R

25|$|Being {{the last}} sura of the Quran, it {{is a kind}} of final {{response}} to the invocation that the reader of the Quran made to God in Al-Fatihah, the first sura of the Quran. The response <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> though God has provided detailed guidance, the seeker of guidance must also pray to God that he remains free from the waswāsa of the Satan.|$|E
25|$|Another {{interesting}} property <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if u has a discontinuity at {{an initial}} time t=t0, the temperature becomes smooth {{as soon as}} t>t0. For example, if a bar of metal has temperature 0 and another has temperature 100 and they are stuck together end to end, then very quickly the temperature {{at the point of}} connection will become 50 and the graph of the temperature will run smoothly from 0 to 50.|$|E
25|$|What {{this means}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> {{if we have}} {{extracted}} all possible energy from a Fermi gas by cooling it to near absolute zero temperature, the fermions are still moving around at a high speed. The fastest ones are moving at a velocity corresponding to a kinetic energy equal to the Fermi energy. This is the Fermi velocity. Only when the temperature exceeds the Fermi temperature do the electrons begin to move significantly faster than at absolute zero.|$|E
50|$|Another {{interesting}} fact <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>even</b> {{though he}} had defeated Garrincha in league games, he was so afraid of him during the 1962 World Cup he constantly asked where the attacker was.|$|R
5000|$|Description from Nick Huggett: This is a Parmenidean {{argument}} that one cannot trust one's sense of hearing. Aristotle's response seems to <b>be</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> inaudible sounds {{can add to}} an audible sound.|$|R

25|$|The great {{ecosystem}} {{concept has}} been most often advanced through concerns over individual species rather than over broader ecological principles. Though 20 or 30 or even 50 years of information on a population may be considered long-term by some, {{one of the important}} lessons of Greater Yellowstone management <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> half a century is not long enough to give a full idea of how a species may vary in its occupation of a wild ecosystem.|$|E
25|$|A very {{important}} point that is routinely overlooked by many modern commentators <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> those Muslim women who wear {{what has come to}} be regarded as stereotypically Islamic clothing – ḥijābs, chādors, and burqas – typically wear these in public only. In private, it is common for women to wear Western-style clothing, and the proliferation within OIC member states of global fashion retail chains from Zara to Victoria's Secret – both of which have branches even in Wahabbi Saudi Arabia – is testament to this.|$|E
25|$|This {{concerns}} {{itself with}} fiery religious fanaticism stoked {{up by the}} sudden death of a loved one. The idea behind the song <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> the most ardent supporter of peace can be drawn into violent conflict if their faith is shattered beyond repair. The title reflects the onset of spiritual darkness that pervades and eventually clouds the mind through irrevocable grief and irretrievable loss. Without sounding too political, one can draw a parallel with the current clime of terrorism, where normally peaceful religious groups are being incensed to hatred.|$|E
60|$|Never had Marianne been so {{unwilling to}} dance in her life, as she <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> and never so much {{fatigued}} by the exercise. She complained {{of it as}} they returned to Berkeley Street.|$|R

5000|$|On {{the night}} of 18 March 2012 while Shatter was in Australia for St Patrick's week festivities there was a {{break-in}} at Shatter's home in Ballinteer, Dublin. The burglar <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening</b> apprehended by Gardai and subsequently convicted.ref> ...|$|R
25|$|Rational {{design of}} a protein relies on an {{in-depth}} knowledge of the protein structure, {{as well as its}} catalytic mechanism. Specific changes are then made by site-directed mutagenesis in an attempt to change the function of the protein. A drawback of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> when the structure and mechanism of action of the protein are well known, the change due to mutation is still difficult to predict. Therefore, an advantage of DE {{is that there is no}} need to understand the mechanism of the desired activity or how mutations would affect it.|$|E
25|$|The loss of 30% of the country's {{generating}} capacity led to much greater reliance on {{liquified natural gas}} and coal. Unusual conservation measures were undertaken. In the immediate aftermath, nine prefectures served by TEPCO experienced power rationing. The government asked major companies to reduce power consumption by 15%, and some shifted their weekends to weekdays to smooth power demand. Converting to a nuclear-free gas and oil energy economy would cost {{tens of billions of}} dollars in annual fees. One estimate <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> including the disaster, more lives would have been lost if Japan had used coal or gas plants instead of nuclear.|$|E
25|$|Mercury {{might have}} helped on the musical {{arrangements}} {{based on the fact}} that (as it has been recalled by former bassists and the band themselves) they were in a more collaborative period in the pre-studio days and he was usually the one getting his way with structural ideas. While it is highly possible that he contributed ideas to the song (the modulation types and the expanded form are closer to his style than to May's), the bottom line <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> in that case Mercury would be more a co-arranger than a co-writer per se (like George Martin on The Beatles' songs).|$|E
25|$|The second {{argument}} of the {{counsel for the}} appellants <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the Court of Criminal Appeal had not erred in construing the presumption in section 15 of the MDA, the presumption was inconsistent with Article 9(1) of the Constitution.|$|R
5000|$|The {{cornerstone}} of the C3 series chips' design philosophy has <b>been</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> a relatively simple in-order scalar core can offer reasonable performance against a complex superscalar out-of-order core if supported by an efficient [...] "front-end", i.e. prefetch, cache and branch prediction mechanisms.|$|R
60|$|It <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>evening,</b> and Barrington had {{departed}} suddenly on business to Winnipeg, when Dane rode {{up to the}} Grange. He asked for Miss Barrington and her niece, and when he heard <b>that</b> his comrade <b>was</b> recovering sensibility, sat down looking very grave.|$|R
25|$|Both {{fabric and}} {{neoprene}} drysuits have advantages and disadvantages: a fabric drysuit is more adaptable to varying water temperatures because different garments can be layered underneath. However, {{they are quite}} bulky and this causes increased drag and swimming effort. Additionally, if a fabric drysuit malfunctions and floods, it loses nearly all of its insulating properties. Neoprene drysuits are comparatively streamlined like wetsuits, {{but in some cases}} do not allow garments to be layered underneath and are thus less adaptable to varying temperatures. An advantage of this construction <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> it if floods completely, it essentially becomes a wetsuit and will still provide a degree of insulation.|$|E
25|$|In 1992 Jagannathan {{started working}} on issues {{concerned}} with prawn farms {{along the coast of}} Tamil Nadu. This time the problems were not from the local landlords, but from large industries from cities such as Chennai, Mumbai, Kolkatta, Delhi and Hyderabad which occupied large areas of land for aquaculture along the coast, which not only threw the landless labourers out of employment but also converted fertile and cultivable land into salty deserts after a few years when the prawn companies moved on. The prawn farms also caused heavy seepage of seawater into the groundwater in the neighbourhood, thus the local people were deprived of clean drinking water resources. The result <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> more small farmers sell their meager land-holdings to multinational prawn companies and move to the cities, filling urban slums.|$|E
25|$|In {{the natural}} state, a VS {{ribozyme}} motif contains 154 nucleotides that fold into six helices. Its RNA contains a self-cleavage element which {{is thought to}} act in the processing of intermediates made through the process of replication. The H-shaped structure of the ribozyme is organized by two three-way junctions which determine the overall fold of the ribozyme. A unique feature of the structure of ribozyme <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>even</b> if the majority of helix IV and distal end of helix VI would be deleted there would be no significant loss of activity However, if the lengths of helix III and V were to be changed there be major loss of activity. The base bulges of the ribozyme, helices II and IV have very important structural roles since replacing them with other nucleotides does not affect their activity. Basically, VS ribozyme's activity is very dependent on the local sequence of the two three-way junctions. The three-way junction present in the VS ribozyme is very similar to the one seen in the small (23S) subunit of rRNA.|$|E

50|$|It {{was based}} on the {{assumption}} that accuracy errors made by stressed soldiers could be made up for by launching multiple rounds per trigger pull.
