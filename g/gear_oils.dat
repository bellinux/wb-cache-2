50|$|API {{viscosity}} {{ratings for}} <b>gear</b> <b>oils</b> {{are not directly}} comparable with those for motor oil, and they are thinner than the figures suggest. For example, many modern gearboxes use a 75W90 gear oil, which is actually of equivalent viscosity to a 10W40 motor oil. Multigrade <b>gear</b> <b>oils</b> are becoming more common; while gear oil does not reach the temperatures of motor oil, it does warm up appreciably as the car is driven, due mostly to shear friction (with {{a small amount of}} heat conduction through the bellhousing from the engine block).|$|E

40|$|An {{optimized}} rotorcraft {{propulsion system}} incorporating a foil air bearing supported Oil-Free engine coupled {{to a high}} power density gearbox using high viscosity <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> is explored. Foil air bearings have adequate load capacity and temperature capability for the highspeed gas generator shaft of a rotorcraft engine. Managing the axial loads of the power turbine shaft (low speed spool) will likely require thrust load support from the gearbox through a suitable coupling or other design. Employing specially formulated, high viscosity <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> for the transmission can yield significant improvements (approx. 2 X) in allowable gear loading.

40|$|Vibration and {{temperature}} monitoring are the techniques for machinery maintenance and fault diagnosis that could predict the gears and bearings failure.,This {{research focuses on}} the condition monitoring of worm gearbox lubricated with contaminated <b>gear</b> <b>oil.</b> Worm gearbox consists of a spirally grooved screw moving against a toothed wheel. The main objectives are to characterize vibration behavior of worm gear as hction contaminated lubricant viscosity. Experimental test rig with inverter, electric motor and gearbox was developed and employed for this research. New <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> with IS 0 VG 100, 460 and 680 had been indentified to serve the sliding friction of both gears as a comparison to contaminated oil. A predetermine speed of electric motof at 900, 1150 and 1400 WM {{was introduced to the}} gearbox and a set of vibration instrumentations with ICP accelerometer model PCB 393 B 04 was installed as to capture the vibration signal generated. As to enhance the effectiveness of condition monitoring techniques, temperature rising in the <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> upon the testing period was monitored using PicoLog USB TC- 08 Data Logger and later to be analyzed. The experiment had revealed that oil with higher viscosity will contribute to less vibration spectrum. At 900 RPM for IS 0 VG 100, IS 0 VG 460 and IS 0 VG 680 the vibration reduction percentage within new and contaminated <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> were 5 1. 02 %, 24. 66 % and 5 1. 3 0 % respectively.

40|$|A {{coal-fired}} power plant operating in the western United States was experiencing short gearbox life in its coal pulverizing operation. The AGMA 6 EP (ISO 320) <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> recommended by the original equipment manufacturer (OEM) failed to provide adequate lubrication and protection based on oil analysis results and gearbox inspection after one year of operation. This was confirmed by excessive wear metals and lower viscosity in the used oil reports. Further analysis of the used extreme pressure (EP) <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> indicated excessive buildup of particulate contaminants in the lubricant and depletion of the EP additive package. The particulate contamination consisted primarily of dirt/coal dust and metallic particulates being generated by bearing and gear tooth wear, and a chain reaction of excessive wear was taking place...|$|R
5000|$|Liqui Moly's {{main product}} is motor oil with MoS2 {{but there are}} also other {{lubricants}} with MoS2 and the additive MoS2 itself to be added by the end user during oil changes. Molybdenum disulfide enhances the lubrication quality of the oil and offers emergency operating features under harsh conditions. It can be added to motor oils and to non-motor oils including gear oil, transmission oil or differentials oils.

5000|$|Shell Rotella T {{is a line}} {{of heavy}} duty engine {{lubrication}} products produced by Royal Dutch Shell. The line includes engine oils, <b>gear</b> <b>oils</b> and coolants. The oil carries both the American Petroleum Institute (API) diesel [...] "C" [...] rating {{as well as the}} API gasoline engine [...] "S" [...] rating. Ratings differ based on the oil. Rotella oils like T3 15w-40 meets both the API CJ-4 and SM specifications, and may be used in both gasoline and diesel engines. However, it is formulated specifically for vehicles without catalytic converters, containing phosphorus levels beyond the 600-800ppm range. Therefore, Rotella is not recommended for gasoline vehicles with catalytic converters due to the higher risk of damaging these emission controls. Newer formulations of Rotella T6 however are API SM rated as safe for pre-2011 gasoline vehicles.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to present the {{descriptive}} and empirical results of the survey responses regarding the <b>gear</b> <b>oil</b> drainage from end-of-life vehicle (ELV).
