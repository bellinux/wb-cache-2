25|$|Consumption of {{incandescent}} light bulbs grew {{rapidly in the}} US. In 1885, an estimated 300,000 <b>general</b> <b>lighting</b> service lamps were sold, all with carbon filaments. When tungsten filaments were introduced, about 50 million lamp sockets existed in the US. In 1914, 88.5 million lamps were used, (only 15% with carbon filaments), and by 1945, annual sales of lamps were 795 million (more than 5 lamps per person per year).|$|E
25|$|House lights provide {{light on}} the theater's seats and aisles for the {{audience}} before and after performances and during intermissions. They are generally incandescent lights, however fluorescent lights or scoops {{may be used in}} some instances. House lights are often controlled by dimmers, but are sometimes on simple switches. Worklights provide <b>general</b> <b>lighting</b> backstage or in the house, and are often fluorescent fixtures. Work lights are almost always non-dimmed.|$|E
25|$|Objections to {{replacement}} of incandescent lamps for <b>general</b> <b>lighting</b> mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate {{the effects of}} these concerns, various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and dimmable types are available.|$|E

25|$|Very small lamps {{may have}} the {{filament}} support wires extended through {{the base of the}} lamp, and can be directly soldered to a printed circuit board for connections. Some reflector-type lamps include screw terminals for connection of wires. Most lamps have metal bases that fit in a socket to support the lamp and conduct current to the filament wires. In the late 19th century, manufacturers introduced a multitude of incompatible lamp bases. General Electric introduced standard base sizes for tungsten incandescent lamps under the Mazda trademark in 1909. This standard was soon adopted across the US, and the Mazda name was used by many manufacturers under license through 1945. Today most incandescent lamps for <b>general</b> <b>lighting</b> service use an Edison screw in candelabra, intermediate, or standard or mogul sizes, or double contact bayonet base. Technical standards for lamp bases include ANSI standard C81.67 and IEC standard 60061-1 for common commercial lamp sizes, to ensure interchangeablitity between different manufacturer's products. Bayonet base lamps are frequently used in automotive lamps to resist loosening due to vibration. A bipin base is often used for halogen or reflector lamps.|$|E
500|$|Every shot in {{the film}} passed through the hands of eight {{different}} teams. The art department gave each shot its color scheme and <b>general</b> <b>lighting.</b> Under Craig Good, the layout department then placed the models in the shot, framed it by setting {{the location of the}} virtual camera, and programmed any camera movement. To make the medium feel as familiar as possible, they sought to stay within the limits of what might be done in a live-action film with real cameras, dollies, tripods, and cranes. Headed by directing animators Rich Quade and Ash Brannon, each shot went to the animation department from the layout. Lasseter opted against Disney's approach of assigning an animator to work on a character throughout a film, but made certain exceptions in scenes where he thought acting was particularly critical. The animators used the Menv program to set each character in the desired pose. Once a sequence of hand-built poses (or [...] "keyframes") was created, the software would build poses for the frames in-between. The animators studied videotapes of the actors for inspiration, and Lasseter rejected automatic lip-syncing. To sync the characters' mouths and facial expressions to the actors' recorded voices, animators spent a week per 8 seconds of animation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Target {{tracking}} is a {{main application}} of {{wireless sensor networks}} (WSNs), and has been studied widely [4], [10]. In this work, we study indoor passive tracking problem using WSNs, in which we assume no equipment is carried by the target and the tracking procedure is passive. We propose to use light to track a moving target in WSNs. To our best knowledge, {{this is the first}} work which tracks a moving object by using <b>light</b> sensors and <b>general</b> <b>light</b> sources. We design a novel probabilistic protocol (system) iLight to track a moving target and several efficient methods to compute the target’s moving patterns (like height, moving speed etc.) at the same time. We implement and evaluate our tracking system iLight in a testbed consisting of 40 sensor nodes, 10 <b>general</b> <b>light</b> sources and one base station. Through extensive experiments, we show that iLight can track a moving target efficiently and accurately. I...|$|R
2500|$|Rendering is the {{generation}} of a 2D image from a 3D model by means of computer programs. A scene file contains objects in a strictly defined language or data structure; it would contain geometry, viewpoint, texture, lighting, and shading information as {{a description of the}} virtual scene. The data contained in the scene file is then passed to a rendering program to be processed and output to a digital image or raster graphics image file. The rendering program is usually built into the computer graphics software, though others are available as plug-ins or entirely separate programs. The term [...] "rendering" [...] may be by analogy with an [...] "artist's rendering" [...] of a scene. Though the technical details of rendering methods vary, the general challenges to overcome in producing a 2D image from a 3D representation stored in a scene file are outlined as the graphics pipeline along a rendering device, such as a GPU. A GPU is a device able to assist the CPU in calculations. If a scene is to look relatively realistic and predictable under virtual lighting, the rendering software should solve the rendering equation. The rendering equation does not account for all lighting phenomena, but is a <b>general</b> <b>lighting</b> model for computer-generated imagery. 'Rendering' is also used to describe the process of calculating effects in a video editing file to produce final video output.|$|E

40|$|We examine various simple {{algorithms}} that exploit homogeneity and accumulated opacity for tracing rays through shaded volumes.
