40|$|Abstract—The high-powered {{machines}} used {{to produce}} coal from longwall coalfaces disperse large amounts of dust, {{a significant proportion of}} it being respirable and therefore injurious to health. Although techniques for reducing the primary make of dust have been developed, together with dust control systems based on water spraying close to the cutting picks, there are still sites where dust make can be excessive. The concept of placing a 'vacuum cleaner ' on the machine to extract and clean the dust has always looked attractive. However, the technical difficulties of providing such a system able to operate efficiently under the numerous constraints present on a coalface have proved insurmountable until recently, when devices based upon water-powered 'dust capture ' tubes have been developed. These tubes, which use high-pressure water sprays to move air and then remove the airborne dust, are small, robust and non-blocking. They can, therefore, be mounted close to the cutting zone where dust is produced. Initially, tubes were integrated with the coal-loading devices on face machines and significant reductions in dust were measured under conditions where the cutting zone could be partly enclosed. The restriction to such conditions has been overcome by the latest development, the <b>extraction</b> <b>drum,</b> in which tubes are sited within the actual rotary cutting drum. Improved control of firedamp within the cutting zone is an additional benefit provided by the <b>extraction</b> <b>drum...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} extractor {{was developed}} for extraction of okra seeds. Studies were conducted on effect of different cylinder speed (5, 6 and 7 m/s), concave clearance (7, 10 and 13 mm), moisture content of okra fruit (12. 3, 15. 8 and 18. 8 % db) and type of <b>extraction</b> <b>drum</b> at a feed rate of 70 kg/h on machine performance and seed quality. Three types of extractor drums namely; square head bolted, rubberized and rasp-bar were used. Seed quality was evaluated for vigour index, dead seed, normal and abnormal germination. The performance of seed extractor was evaluated for its extraction efficiency, cleaning efficiency, seed loss and energy consumption at different crop and machine variables. Extraction efficiency (99. 3 %) caused by square head bolted drum was found highest among all the three extraction mechanisms. Cleaning efficiency {{was found in the}} range of 97. 9 to 99. 6 % for all crop variables. The value of seed loss (4. 7 %) was low with the square head bolted drum in comparison to rasp-bar and rubberized extraction mechanism. The average energy consumption per quintal (100 kg) seed was found to be 1. 9 kWh. It was found that germination and vigour index decreased with increase in pod moisture content. Higher germination was found with square head bolted drum as compared to the rasp-bar and rubberized drum. The germination decreased, whereas dead seed percentage increased with cylinder speed. The best seed quality machine performance was found at 12. 3 percent moisture content (d. b.), 7 mm concave clearance and 5 m/s cylinder speed with the square head bolted drum extraction mechanism...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} model of solving two-phase flow {{of gas and}} dust particles was built by established the k-ε-Θ-kp equation. Moreover, by using FLUENT software, the diffusion rule of dust pollution in the whole-rock fully mechanized workface was researched with different air-draft amount. The result showed that when the air-draft amount increased from 320 m 3 /min to 600 m 3 /min, de-dust ability of <b>extraction</b> fan <b>drum</b> is gathering strength, pervasion intensity of producing dust is continuously decreased in tunneling place. The simulation results of each measuring point are basically consistent with the field measurement results...|$|R
40|$|A semi-automated coal {{extraction}} system with longwall drum ranging shearer is described {{to illustrate the}} way in which knowledge of mobile robots can be used to tackle previously unsolved technical problems. Height adjustment by means of sonsors of the drums along the limit between the coal and country rock is the first step towards the automation of coal <b>extraction</b> with <b>drum</b> ranging shearers. Because of the changing conditions during the extraction operations, unique sensor control of the drum height is not expedient. A multi-sensor system with superimposed seam model increases the control potential. This multi-sensor system makes it necessary to merge the individual statements using algorithms derived from AI research. The sensor and control structure used for this purpose is described. It permits hybrid theoretical value generation, either from the on-line sensor guidance or optionally via an extrapolation from the environment model...|$|R
50|$|During <b>extraction</b> of <b>drums</b> {{from the}} bottom of the pools, an {{accident}} occurred that might have cost two workers' lives. After the left-hand pool was covered with protective lids, cleanup workers cut windows inside them with torches in order to feed in a capturing device that lifted drums {{from the bottom}}. The windows were covered with iron sheets to protect the workers from radiation and prevent them from falling in. During this work, one of the workers, a starshina 1st stage, inadvertently stepped onto an iron sheet covering one of the windows. The sheet failed to support his weight, and they both fell into the pool's radioactive water. As the worker fell, his legs got caught under some nuclear waste drums, and the water splashed onto the others, who also did not have radiation protection equipment.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} a new {{algorithm}} for removing drums from a polyphonic audio signal. The aim of this algorithm is to discard time/frequency bins which present a percussive magnitude evolution, according to a pre-defined parametric model. Special care is taken to reduce the irrelevant removal of frequency modulated signal {{such as the ones}} produced by the singing voice. Performance evaluation is carried out using objective measures commonly used by the community. Compared with four state-of-the-art algorithms, the proposed algorithm shows competitive performances at a low computational cost.

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, {{we propose}} a {{supervised}} multilayer factorization method designed for harmonic/percussive source separation and <b>drum</b> <b>extraction.</b> Our method decomposes the audio signals in sparse orthogonal components which capture the harmonic content, while the drum {{is represented by}} an extension of non negative matrix factorization which is able to exploit time-frequency dictionaries {{to take into account}} non stationary drum sounds. The drum dictionaries represent various real drum hits and the decomposition has more physical sense and allows for a better interpretation of the results. Experiments on real music data for a harmonic/percussive source separation task show that our method outperforms other state of the art algorithms. Finally, our method is very robust to non stationary harmonic sources that are usually poorly decomposed by existing methods...|$|R
40|$|The {{manufacturing}} of {{washing machines}} has lately {{been an important}} issue for the appliance industry. Current environmental awareness demands the improvement of machine efficiency and increasing of quality of washing processes. Developing of high efficient and high speed spinning washing machines raises the problem of designing smart suspension systems to control vibration and noise in real time. In the paper a horizontal-axis washing machine is under the study. The machine has a drum with perforated walls. In the water <b>extraction</b> process, the <b>drum</b> starts rotation and this gives rise to significant centrifugal imbalance forces and imbalanced rotation of the laundry mass. This results in vibration and shaking. By elimination of such vibrations {{it will be possible}} to design more silent washing machines for higher wash loads within the same outside dimensions. In the paper the results of modelling of dynamics of washing machine and designing of smart suspension system comprising magnetoreological dampers for semi-active vibration control are presented. The commercial software MSC. ADAMS/View and MATLAB/Simulink have been used for 3 D-modelling of dynamics of washing machine. Both traditional suspension with passive dampers and suspension with magnetoreological dampers are implemented into the developing mathematical models. Identification of passive dampers and magnetoreological dampers dynamics was done based on experimental study. Full scale test rig of washing machine was used for validating the models. The validated model has been used for designing and optimization of smart suspension system with magnetoreological dampers of high speed spinning washing machines. Analysis of the obtained results has proved a big potential of utilization of magnetoreological dampers for developing of semi-active suspension systems for washing machines...|$|R
40|$|A Cochlear Implant (CI) is {{a medical}} device that enables profoundly hearing {{impaired}} people to perceive sounds by electrically stimulating the auditory nerve using an electrode array implanted in the cochlea. The focus of most research on signal processing for CIs has been on strategies to improve speech understanding in quiet and in background noise, since the main aim for implanting a CInbsp;(and still is) to restore the ability to communicate. Most CI users perform quite well in terms of speech understanding. On the other hand, music perception and appreciation are generally very poor. The main goal of this PhD project was to investigate and to improve the poor music enjoyment in CI users. An initial experiment with multi-track recordings was carried out to examine the music mixing preferences for different instruments in polyphonic or complex music. In general, a preference for clear vocals and attenuated instruments was observed with preservation of bass and drums. Based on this knowledge, a music pre-processing scheme for mono and stereo recordings wasnbsp;which is capable of balancing vocals/bass/drums against the other instruments. The scheme is based on thenbsp;of harmonic and percussive components in the spectrogram and on the spatial information of the instruments in typical stereo recordings. Subsequently, the music pre-processing scheme was evaluated in a take-home experiment with post-lingually deafened CI users andnbsp;genres of music, providing encouraging results for building a tool for music training or rehabilitation programs.
