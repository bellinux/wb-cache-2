25|$|Information {{management}} (IM) is {{the collection}} and management of information from one or more sources {{and the distribution of}} that information to one or more audiences.

40|$|Reliability {{degradation}} {{analysis is}} {{the analysis of}} the occurrences of degradations and the times of maintenance to determine their reliability and risk implications. A program is presented for applying reliability degradation analyses to <b>maintenance</b> <b>data</b> collected at nuclear power plants. As a specific part of the program, time trending of <b>maintenance</b> <b>data</b> is illustrated. <b>Maintenance</b> <b>data</b> on residual heat removal (RHR) pumps and service water (SW) pumps at selected boiling water reactor (BWR) plants are evaluated to show how trends in <b>maintenance</b> <b>data,</b> which generally do not involve failures, can be used to understand effectiveness of maintenance. These trends also are translated to specific impacts on pump unavailability and on core-damage frequency (assuming that the trends in failure rate are the same as those observed for degradation rate). The second application shows the use of reliability degradation analysis to quantitatively evaluate the effect of maintenance, i. e., the quantitative change in component unavailability when no maintenance is performed. Assessment of these impacts are important since they measure the reliability and risk impacts of maintenance and can be fed back to the maintenance program to improve its effectiveness...|$|R
