40|$|ABSTRACT Two {{experiments}} were conducted using {{a total of}} 288 Hy-Line W- 36 day-old pullets in each experiment The pullets {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the six dietary treatments that consisted 0,. 3,. 6,. 9, 1. 8, or 3. 6 mg supplemental pantothenic acid/kg of a corn and soybean meal basal diet (4. 8 mg/kg). Six replicates of eight pullets per replicate were used per treatment in each experiment. Feed and water were provided for ad libitum access. The pullets were housed <b>in</b> <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> pens with raised wire floors. Body weight, body weight gain, average feed consumption per day, total feed consumption, and feed conversion were determined at 3 and 6 wk of age (WOA). The birds were observed for any signs of pantothenic acid deficiency. At the end of a 6 -wk experimental period, the pullets previously receiving the diets containing either 0 or 3. 6 mg supplemental pantothenic acid/kg of diet were raised to sexual maturity and their age at sexual maturity, body weight at 24 WOA, and average number of eggs per pullet through 32 WOA were measured in both of the experiments. No differences (P>. 05) in total body weight, body weight gain, average feed consumption per day, total feed consumption, and feed conversion were observed in any of the supplemental pantothenic acid treatments from 0 to 3 and 3 to 6 WOA. None of birds during the experimental period showed any signs of deficiency. No differences were observed in the subsequent age at sexual maturity, number of eggs laid, and the body weight at 24 WOA. It was concluded from these experiments that Single Comb White Leghorn pullets require at least a total of 4. 8 mg/kg pantothenic acid based in a corn-soybean meal diet from 0 to 6 WOA and at subsequent sexual maturity for optimum performance...|$|R

40|$|Administration {{of large}} doses of thyroid hormone {{preparations}} (desiccated thyroid powder, thyroxine, triiodothyronine, diiodotyrosine) to cholesterol-fed chicks was asso-ciated with decreased rate of weight gain and partial inhibition of hypercholesterolemia. Consistent, definitive inhibition of aorta and coronary atherogenesis was not observed, despite partial suppression of hypercholesterolemia. Potassium iodide and thyroid-stimulating hormone of the anterior pituitary were essentially without effect. PREVIOUS studies from this departmentindicated that thyroid hormone admin-istration was partially effective in preventing hypercholesterolemia and atherogenesis in cholesterol-fed chicks. 1 " * It was also 8 hown that hypothyroidism counteracted {{the ability of}} estrogens to prevent coronary atherosclero-sis in cholesterol-fed cockerels. 5 - 7 The experi-ments {{described in the present}} report were undertaken to explore further the parameters of the effects of tli 3 rroid hormone.

40|$|During {{the course}} of our studies on the role of hormones in atherosclerosis, we have become {{increasingly}} {{aware of the importance of}} the protein level in the diet upon the action of hormones. 2 " 5 In the present study, therefore, the lipid and atherogenic responses to the administration of an anabolic hormone, testosterone propionate, and a catabolic hor-mone, hydrocortisone (compound F), were analyzed at two different levels of protein in a cholesterol-oil supplemented diet. Methods Two series (S 72, S 82) of experiments were done and involved a total of six groups and 230 birds.

40|$|An {{experiment}} {{was conducted to}} evaluate the use of a single diet containing 18 % crude protein (CP) and 3000 kcal/kgME as an alternative feeding regimen to 3 other conventional feeding standards for broiler production. Three hundred and twenty (320) Anak broilers were randomly divided into four treatment groups. The first three groups served as control while the 4 th was the tested treatment. Broilers in group 1 (G 1) representing control 1 were fed diet with 23 % CP 0 - 3 weeks, 20 % CP 3 - 6 weeks and 16 % CP 6 - 8 weeks. While those in group 2 (G 2) representing control 2 were fed diet with 23 % CP 0 - 6 weeks and 14 % CP 6 - 8 weeks. Also broilers in group 3 (G 3) representing control 3 were fed diet with 20 % CP 0 - 4 weeks and 16 % CP 4 - 8 weeks, while those in group 4 were fed 18 % CP 0 - 8 weeks. All diets contained 3000 kcal/kg of metabolizable energy. The birds were kept <b>in</b> <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> cage for 8 weeks. Feed and water were supplied ad libitum. At the 8 th week, 10 birds were randomly selected from each of the four treatment groups and starved for 18 hours. They were killed by cervical dislocation and used to determine the carcass parameters. Performance results at 8 weeks showed that broilers fed on 18 % CP and 3000 kcal/kg ME had the lowest feed intake (P 0. 05) and better feed to gain ratio than the third control group (p 0. 05). Dietary crude protein CP 18 % and 3000 kcal/kgME for broilers resulted in better carcass weight, breast meat yield and gizzard weight when compared with the controls (P< 0. 05). It also reduced abdominal fat content (p< 0. 05). Economically, feeding broiler on diet of 18 % CP and 3000 kcal/kg of energy for 0 - 8 weeks also recorded a significantly reduced cost benefit ratio a factor that determines how best the production cost is utilized (P< 0. 05). It was then concluded that using dietary CP 18 % and 3000 kcal/kgME for feeding broilers from 0 - 8 weeks, could be an alternative to the conventional feeding methods currently used for broilers where they are fed 2 or 3 different diets in a space of 0 - 8 weeks where they are expected to be marketed. It was also noted that such feeding method would be suitable for poultry farmers who practice on-farm feed production...|$|R

Hatchlings were weighed, examined for gross developmental abnormalities, and transferred to a <b>battery</b> <b>brooder,</b> where they were raised for 7 d. Chicks were then weighed, and 20 birds per treatment were randomly chosen for necropsy. The brain, heart, kidneys, and liver were removed and weighed. Livers were processed further for determination of PFOS concentrations and histological assessment. Hatchability was reduced significantly in all treatment groups in a dose-dependent manner. The calculated median lethal dose was 4. 9 mg PFOS/g egg. Perfluorooctane sulfonate did not affect posthatch body or organ weights. Exposure to PFOS caused pathological changes in the liver characterized by bile duct hyperplasia, periportal inflammation, and hepatic cell necrosis at doses as low as 1. 0 mg PFOS/g egg. Perfluorooctane sulfonate concentrations in the liver increased in a dose-dependent manner. Based on reduced hatchability, the lowest-observed-adverse-effect level was 0. 1 mg PFOS/g egg...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{purpose of}} Experiment 1 was to im-prove the {{digestibility}} of fat {{through the use}} of supple-mental lipase enzymes. A 2 × 3 factorial arrangement of treatments involving two levels of animal-vegetable blend fat (AV) (4 and 8 %) and three enzyme treatments, namely none; Pancreatic, 0. 714 %; and Pancreatin, 0. 714 %, were randomly allocated within a <b>battery</b> <b>brooder.</b> There was an increase in diet ME and apparent fat digestibility when Pancreatic and Pancreatin en-zymes were used (P < 0. 01). However, both enzymes caused lower feed intake and lower BW gain (P < 0. 01). In Experiment 2, Pancreatic enzyme was used at graded levels of 0, 0. 214, 0. 429, 0. 643, 0. 857, and 1. 071 %, involving 4 % dietary AV fat. The ME values were greater as the enzyme level increased (P < 0. 01).

They found that chicks kept under stand-ard <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> conditions and fed a purified Drackett protein diet (analyzed to contain about 50 ppm. of zinc), showed deficiency symptoms characterized by a retardation in growth, a shortening and thickening of the long bones and a reduc-tion in the ash content of the dry fat-free tibia. These symptoms were not observed when adequate zinc was fed in the diet. In another more detailed report, these work-ers (O'Dell and Savage, 1957 b), obtained a growth response from zinc supplementa-tion in five experiments. These {{results indicated that the}} Drackett protein diet used by a number of workers (Dannen-burg et al., 1955; Morrison et al., 1955) for studying unidentified minerals may be deficient in zinc even though 6 - 7 ppm. of zinc is supplied by the mineral mixture.

40|$|ABSTRACT Frequently, {{publications}} {{pertaining to}} waterfowl state that medicated feeds {{should not be}} fed to ducklings and goslings. In some localities, producers and hobbyists who raise {{a small number of}} ducklings and goslings can purchase only medicated chick, turkey, or gamebird starter and grower feeds. Because of the lack of documented information on this subject and the numer-ous requests for advice on this matter, anticoccidial drugs, zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline, and ampro-lium, were mixed in mash feed and fed to Khaki Campbell male ducklings to 4 weeks of age. No significant differences in mean body weight, mortality, and anatomical development were observed among the treatments. Medicated commercial crumble turkey and chick starter feeds produced significantly better feed conversion than the mash medicated or nonmedicated feeds. These differences can be attributed to greater feed spillage with the mash feed. Some ducklings in all treatments showed unsteadiness of gait and shaky legs. These conditions disappeared when the ducklings were moved from the <b>battery</b> <b>brooder</b> to an outside pen. Zoalene, sulfaquinoxaline,and amprolium used at the recommended levels for chickens and turkeys did not cause any leg or anatomical problems in ducklings.

All {{experiments were}} conducted with female Ross × Ross 308 or 708 broilers <b>in</b> <b>brooder</b> <b>batteries</b> from 0 to 18 d posthatching. Treatments had 5 to 8 replications with 5 or 6 broilers per replicate pen. Diets in all experiments were fed without or with Gly (2. 32 % total Gly + Ser). All diets contained 0. 25 % l-Lys·HCl except in experiment 1, where no crystalline Lys was added. In experiment 1, the total dietary Lys level was 1. 26 % with TSAA:Lys of 0. 72 and 0. 76. Increasing TSAA:Lys increased (P < 0. 07) G:F. The main effect of Gly was not significant for ADG, ADFI, or G:F; however, G:F was increased by Gly in broilers fed 0. 72 but not in those fed 0. 76 TSAA:Lys (Gly × TSAA:Lys, P < 0. 03). In experiment 2, the total dietary Lys level was 1. 26 % with TSAA:Lys of 0. 51, 0. 68, 0. 72, and 0. 76. Glycine addition did not affect ADG, ADFI, or G:F; however, increasing TSAA:Lys linearly increased (P < 0. 01) ADG, ADFI, and G:F and the response was quadratic for ADG and G:F. Experiment 3 was similar to experiment 2 except the total dietary Lys level was 1. 35 %. Glycine addition increased (P < 0. 03) G:F and decreased (P < 0. 04) serum uric acid (SUA) and se-rum urea N concentrations. Also, increasing TSAA:Lys linearly and quadratically (P < 0. 02) increased ADG, ADFI, and G:F.
