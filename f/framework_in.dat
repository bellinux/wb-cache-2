Fleming's plan involved maintaining communication with Gibraltar and launching sabotage operations against the Nazis. In 1941 he liaised with Donovan over American involvement in a measure intended to ensure that the Germans did not dominate the seaways.|$|E

40|$|A {{rigidity}} {{theory is}} developed for <b>frameworks</b> <b>in</b> a metric space with {{two types of}} distance constraints. A mixed sparsity graph characterisation is obtained for the infinitesimal and continuous rigidity of completely regular bar-joint <b>frameworks</b> <b>in</b> a flat realisation of the real projective plane. The bar constraints are of two types, representing either direct distance or a re-entrant distance, and the underlying structure graphs are bi-coloured multigraphs. Similar combinatorial characterisations of rigidity are obtained for three other double-distance contexts, namely, frameworks restricted to surfaces with Euclidean and geodesic distance constraints, <b>frameworks</b> <b>in</b> the plane with Euclidean and non-Euclidean distance constraints, and, finally, direction-length <b>frameworks</b> <b>in</b> the non-Euclidean plane.

5|$|Leonardo Bruni was {{the first}} to use {{tripartite}} periodization in his History of the Florentine People (1442). Bruni's first two periods were based on those of Petrarch, but he added a third period because he believed that Italy was no longer in a state of decline. Flavio Biondo used a similar <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> Decades of History from the Deterioration of the Roman Empire (1439–1453).|$|E

5|$|In physics, {{string theory}} is a {{theoretical}} <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> which the point-like particles of particle physics {{are replaced by}} one-dimensional objects called strings. These strings look like small segments or loops of ordinary string. String theory describes how strings propagate through space and interact with each other. On distance scales larger than the string scale, a string will look just like an ordinary particle, with its mass, charge, and other properties determined by the vibrational state of the string. Splitting and recombination of strings correspond to particle emission and absorption, giving rise to the interactions between particles.|$|E
5|$|Soon after {{publishing}} the special {{theory of relativity}} in 1905, Einstein started {{thinking about how to}} incorporate gravity into his new relativistic <b>framework.</b> <b>In</b> 1907, beginning with a simple thought experiment involving an observer in free fall, he embarked on what would be an eight-year search for a relativistic theory of gravity. After numerous detours and false starts, his work culminated in the presentation to the Prussian Academy of Science in November 1915 of what are now known as the Einstein field equations. These equations specify how the geometry of space and time is influenced by whatever matter and radiation are present, and form the core of Einstein's general theory of relativity.|$|E

5|$|Written by Basil Dawson, this four-part story {{involving}} {{murders in}} Victorian London. Dawson, a veteran screenwriter, {{was approached by}} script editor Robert Holmes to develop a story which would introduce a new companion to replace Sarah Jane Smith following her departure. The new character {{was to be a}} Cockney girl whom the Doctor would take under his wing and educate, in the manner of Eliza Doolittle in the George Bernard Shaw play Pygmalion. This story was planned to be the fourth story of Season 14. The Gaslight Murders was quickly abandoned, however. Its spot in the schedule was ultimately filled by The Face of Evil, while Holmes reused the general <b>framework</b> <b>in</b> The Talons of Weng-Chiang.|$|E
