60|$|When the ballast was out {{the captain}} hesitated. On the Moorish coast {{sheltered}} ports are not numerous, {{and for the most}} part Cayman landed and shipped cargo from anchorages behind the sands and reefs. In consequence, her main anchor and cable were very large and heavy, but the captain thought the vessel must be further lightened in order to float across the shoals. Now the iron was landed, she rolled violently, and one hot afternoon, Kit, holding on by a runner, leaned against the bulwarks. Macallister and Miguel occupied the <b>hatch</b> <b>coaming,</b> the captain the grating by the tiller.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you want}} to see the coach locked you'd better go aboard. It's due now," [...] says Mr. Geary. I enter through the door amidships. There is nothing here for display. The inner skin of the gas-tanks comes down to within a foot or two of my head and turns over just short of the turn of the bilges. Liners and yachts {{disguise}} their tanks with decoration, but the G.P.O. serves them raw under a lick of grey official paint. The inner skin shuts off fifty feet of the bow and as much of the stern, but the bow-bulkhead is recessed for the lift-shunting apparatus as the stern is pierced for the shaft-tunnels. The engine-room lies almost amidships. Forward of it, extending to the turn of the bow tanks, is an aperture--a bottomless hatch at present--into which our coach will be locked. One looks down over the coamings three hundred feet to the despatching-caisson whence voices boom upward. The light below is obscured to a sound of thunder, as our coach rises on its guides. It enlarges rapidly from a postage-stamp to a playing-card; to a punt and last a pontoon. The two clerks, its crew, do not even look up as it comes into place. The Quebec letters fly under their fingers and leap into the docketed racks, while both captains and Mr. Geary satisfy them selves that the coach is locked home. A clerk passes the way-bill over the <b>hatch</b> <b>coaming.</b> Captain Purnall thumb-marks and passes it to Mr. Geary. Receipt has been given and taken. [...] "Pleasant run," [...] says Mr. Geary, and disappears through the door which a foot high pneumatic compressor locks after him.|$|E
5000|$|Efficiency {{has always}} been key {{in the design of}} {{container}} ships. [...] While containers may be carried on conventional break-bulk ships, cargo holds for dedicated container ships are specially constructed to speed loading and unloading, and to efficiently keep containers secure while at sea. [...] A key aspect of container ship specialization is the design of the hatches, the openings from the main deck to the cargo holds. [...] The hatch openings stretch the entire breadth of the cargo holds, and are surrounded by a raised steel structure known as the <b>hatch</b> <b>coaming.</b> [...] On top of the hatch coamings are the hatch covers. Until the 1950s, hatches were typically secured with wooden boards and tarpaulins held down with battens. [...] Today, some hatch covers can be solid metal plates that are lifted on and off the ship by cranes, while others are articulated mechanisms that are opened and closed using powerful hydraulic rams.|$|E
5000|$|Professor Faulkner {{who did the}} {{forensic}} independent analysis {{of the loss of}} the M.V. Derbyshire explains why this is such a problem for bulk carriers. He states that [...] "It is quite possible that some of the many unexplained heavy weather losses (of bulk carriers) may have been caused by <b>hatch</b> cover or <b>coaming</b> failures because fore end plunging due to flooding of large holds can be rapid." [...] He noted in his report that [...] "because of their high inertias and natural pitch periods, these large ships do not rise to the waves, as appropriately experienced masters have confirmed. They tend to bury into them." [...] Faulkner concluded that [...] "beyond any reasonable doubt, the direct cause of the loss of the M.V. Derbyshire was the quite inadequate strength of her cargo hatch covers to withstand the forces of Typhoon Orchid." [...] He also noted that [...] "It is not possible to say which of the eighteen covers failed first, or from which direction the waves came; but evidence and other arguments suggest that the no. 1 hatch covers were probably the first to yield, probably from waves over the bow with the ship hove-to." ...|$|R
5000|$|The No. 1 {{hatch cover}} was entirely inside the No. 1 hatch and showed {{indications}} of buckling from external loading. Sections of the coaming {{in way of}} the No. 1 hatch were fractured and buckled inward. The No. 2 hatch cover was missing and the coaming on the No. 2 hatch was fractured and buckled. Hatches Nos. 3 and 4 were covered with mud; one corner of hatch cover No. 3 {{could be seen in}} place. Hatch cover No. 5 was missing. A series of 16 consecutive hatch cover clamps were observed on the No. 5 <b>hatch</b> <b>coaming.</b> Of this series, the first and eighth were distorted or broken. All of the 14 other clamps were undamaged and in the open position. The No. 6 hatch was open and a hatch cover was standing on end vertically in the hatch. The hatch covers were missing from hatches Nos. 7 and 8 and both coamings were fractured and severely distorted. The bow section abruptly ended just aft of hatch No. 8 and the deck plating was ripped up from the separation to the forward end of hatch No. 7.|$|E
5000|$|The rescue chamber was a {{pear shaped}} steel chamber, the big end uppermost, seven {{feet at the}} {{greatest}} diameter and ten feet high. It is divided into an upper closed compartment and a lower open compartment by a horizontal bulkhead which has a water tight hatch in its middle. Surrounding the lower compartment is a ballast tank of a capacity just {{equal to that of}} the lower compartment. Inside the lower compartment is a reel with 400 ft of [...]5 in steel wire on it. The reel is operated by a shaft leading into the upper compartment. The shaft is rotated by an air motor. On the bottom edge of the lower compartment a rubber gasket is embedded into a circular groove, so that when the chamber is brought into contact with a flat surface (the hatch ring) a water tight joint may be effected with the application of pressure. Attached to the upper compartment is an air supply and an atmospheric exhaust hose, wire wound for strength. Also electric cables for telephone and light are attached. A wire pendant for hoisting and lowering is shackled into a pad-eye on top. This wire is also used for retrieving the chamber in case of emergency. The forward and after hatches of American submarines were fitted for attaching the rescue chamber. They have a flat doughnut shaped plate welded to the <b>hatch</b> <b>coaming</b> upon which the bottom of the chamber rests and a bail over the center of the hatch to which the haul down wire must be attached by the diver.|$|E
