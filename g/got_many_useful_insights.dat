We then test whether such trading patterns affect returns. Our stimulus for this bias is a string of same-sign earnings surprises. Though not justified by subsequent price performance, we uncover evidence that investors extrapolate past trends in earnings performance. Specifically, following strings of consecutive positive earnings surprises, the amount of net buying after controlling for other regularities in trading activity is significantly greater than it is after an isolated positive surprise. This difference is increasing in the number of consecutive positive surprises in the string. Furthermore, subsequent to strings, purchasing activity is negatively correlated with returns throughout the remainder of the year.

40|$|Synopsis. In {{this paper}} we discuss the notion of {{individual}} frailty and its interpretation. In addition, we consider the application of this concept to different areas of demography, epidemiology, and the genetics of aging. 1 Hidden differences in the survival chances of individuals in a population influence {{the shape of the}} mortality rate observed in demographic and epidemiological studies. To evaluate the contribution of such hidden variations to observed hazards, frailty models have been suggested. The application of these models to the analysis of survival data in demography, epidemiology, and biostatistics has opened up new avenues for survival studies. However, along with <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> <b>insights</b> and ideas, several unjustified beliefs (myths) have also been generated. In this paper we critically discuss these beliefs. In particular, we discuss the notion of individual frailty and show that the interpretation thereof depends on the identifiability conditions specified for the respective frailty model. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of shared frailty models with and without observed covariates.

We discuss new bivariate survival models with non-gamma frailty distribution and potential directions for further research...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{a number}} of {{philosophers}} of science have claimed that much explanation in the sciences, especially in the biomedical and social sciences, is mechanistic explanation. I argue the account of mechanistic explanation provided in this tradition has not been entirely satisfactory, as it has neglected to describe in complete detail the crucial causal structure of mechanistic explanation. I show how the interventionist approach to causation, especially within a structural equations framework, provides a simple and elegant account of the causal structure of mechanisms. This account explains the <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> <b>insights</b> of traditional accounts of mechanism, such as Carl Craver's account in his book Explaining the Brain (2007), but also helps to correct the omissions of such accounts. One of these omissions is the failure to provide an explicit formulation of a modularity constraint that {{plays a significant role}} in mechanistic explanation. One virtue of the interventionist/structural equations framework is that it allows for a simple formulation of a modularity constraint on mechanistic explanation.

40|$|An {{innovative}} {{feature of}} this paper is the demonstration of the feasibility of real-time vehicle reidentification algorithm development at a signalized intersection, where different traffic detection technologies were employed at upstream and downstream locations. Previous research by the authors on vehicle reidentification has utilized the same traffic sensors (e. g., conventional square inductive loops) and detectors (e. g., high-speed scanning detector cards) at both locations. In this paper, an opportunity arose {{for the first time to}} collect a downstream data set from a temporary installation of a prototype innovative inductive loop sensor known as a "blade" sensor in conjunction with conventional inductive loops upstream. At both locations, advanced high-speed scanning detector cards were used. Although the number of vehicles for which data could be collected was small, encouraging results were obtained for vehicle reidentification performance in this system of mixed traffic detection technologies.

40|$|Although {{heavy-tailed}} fluctuations are {{ubiquitous in}} complex systems, {{a good understanding}} of the mechanisms that generate them is still lacking. Optical complex systems are ideal candidates for investigating heavy-tailed fluctuations, as they allow recording large datasets under controllable experimental conditions. A dynamical regime that has attracted a lot of attention over the years is the so-called low-frequency fluctuations (LFFs) of semiconductor lasers with optical feedback. In this regime, the laser output intensity is characterized by abrupt and apparently random dropouts. The statistical analysis of the inter-dropout-intervals (IDIs) has provided <b>many</b> <b>useful</b> <b>insights</b> into the underlying dynamics. However, the presence of large temporal fluctuations in the IDI sequence has not yet been investigated. Here, by applying fluctuation analysis we show that the experimental distribution of IDI fluctuations is heavy-tailed, and specifically, is well-modeled by a non-Gaussian stable distribution. We find a good qualitative agreement with simulations of the Lang-Kobayashi model. Moreover, we uncover a transition from a less-heavy-tailed state at low pump current to a more-heavy-tailed state at higher pump current. Our results indicate that fluctuation analysis can be a useful tool for investigating the output signals of complex optical systems; it can be used for detecting underlying regime shifts, for model validation and parameter estimation.

The simulations are performed on a representative sample of labor force participants, for which lifetime labor market histories are produced from the panel data collected by consecutive Estonian Labor Force Surveys.

Studies that focus on the city tend to examine the effects of code, but rarely unpack the constitution and mechanics of the code producing those effects. To provide a more holistic account of the relationship between code and the city I forward two interlinked conceptual frameworks. The first places code within a wider socio-technical assemblage. The second conceives the city as being composed of millions of such assemblages. In so doing, the latter seeks to provide a means of productively building a conceptual and empirical understanding of programmable urbanism that scales from individual lines of code to the complexity of an entire urban system...|$|R
