40|$|Abstract. <b>Fine-blanking</b> with {{negative}} clearance {{is a kind}} of fine blanking processes. The punch size of <b>fine-blanking</b> {{with negative}} clearance is larger than the die size. The paper does lots of simulations for the changes of blanking force in <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance and common blanking by DEFORM software, and the blanking force curves are gained by these experiments. The changing principle of blanking force and internal material is obtained through the simulation and experiments. The result shows that simulation blanking force of AISI- 1045 is lager than the actual blanking force. According to the curves derived from experiments, we can see that the maximum blanking force of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance is higher than common blanking force. Compared with <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance, the common blanking force reduces faster after the blanking force reaches maximum value. The experiment result shows that the force of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance under a smaller blanking clearance is a bit bigger than the force of common blanking force, and the blanking quality of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance is much better than that of common blanking. Cracks can be closed effectively by the special squeeze forming in fine blanking with negative clearance. Then, the crack can not expand continuously, and the bonding force is enhanced. The squeeze forming can restrain intergranular deformation and reduce the damage. However, the stretch forming easily leads to the inner crack and defect of materials.

Large {{deformation}} {{is a major}} deformation {{operation in}} many metal-forming processes, such as forging, rolling, extrusion, stamping and <b>fine-blanking.</b> It is difficult to study the deformation changes in these processes in a practical way, through the measurement of forces, due to the severe and localized nature of plastic deformation {{such as in the}} <b>fine-blanking</b> operation.

40|$|An {{excellent}} {{quality of}} shearing edge implies that a smooth cutting edge without tearing will be observed {{on the whole}} edge surface. This {{is one of the}} most significant features of the <b>fine-blanking</b> process. To achieve this good blanking edge quality in <b>fine-blanking,</b> quite a large number of factors need to be considered simultaneously during the operation, such as blanking speed, processing material, product shape, lubrication and tool geometry. Thus, the objective of this paper is mainly to study the influence of tool geometry change in <b>fine-blanking</b> for different materials. This is because the nose radius usually seriously deteriorates with increasing service period in mass production, which eventually causes the entire loss of the specific features of the <b>fine-blanking</b> process. Therefore, a tailor-made experimental study was carried out to investigate the relationship between the punch nose radius and the shearing edge quality, such as the shearing edge surface finish, burr height and die-roll height, during <b>fine-blanking</b> for different types of materials.

40|$|In <b>fine-blanking</b> processes, {{localized}} deformation {{is prone}} to cause tearing failure at the surface of shearing edges, which can influence the quality and functionality of the blanked part.

According to the special requirement of the <b>fine-blanking</b> technique, the major process attributes, such as the vee-ring, the ejector and the edge radii of tools, have been taken into account in the finite element model. The punch-die clearance was set to 0. 5 % of the thickness of the workpiece. To verify the effectiveness of the simulation, the equivalent strain on the sheared surface of a SS 400 steel specimen has been determined experimentally. The experimental values of the equivalent strain have been estimated by measuring the relative displacements of the local grids pre-etched on the meridian plane of the specimen. The results of the finite element simulation are in proper agreement with the experimental findings.

But for lots of special and complicated structures of <b>fine-blanking</b> dies, especially some progressive dies, many problems occurred during the traditional two-dimensional design method, such as heavy workload, time-consuming, difficulty of modification, difficulty of checking interference, difficulty of novice entry. To solve these problems, a rapid parametric CAD system based on SolidWorks is developed for <b>fine-blanking</b> progressive dies in the present study. The system comprises five modules, namely DIEBASE, WORKPART, STANDARD, MOTION and DRAWING.

Therefore, the large strain analysis of most metal-forming processes cannot be carried out successfully by experiments. Thus, this paper aims to present the development of an effective process of strain measurement for severe and localized plastic deformation. To validate the process, an experimental remeshing technique was adopted and applied on a tension test to measure strains in practice. As a result, it was found that, on average, only a 10 % difference in effective strains was observed between the experimental findings with and without remeshing.

Studying on the blanking force size of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance in different blanking stages is a very important significance for studying die wear and analyzing the state of material stress-strain. Firstly, numerical simulation and stress state analysis of the <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance are carried out, with DEFORM-metal forming finite element analysis software. Afterward the relationship curve of blanking force and stroke are measured, and the blanking force with different blanking stages of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance is analyzed by the simulation and the experiment. The analysis result shows that the simulation blanking force is bigger than the experimental result (error about 15 %), but the blanking force variation tendency is accordant. while the punch pushes down within 0. 1 mm, the blanking force changes quickly. The metal sheet will enter into the state of plastic deformation after the blanking force reaching maximum value. Along with the punch continues to move down, the area of shear zone is decrescent so that the blanking force inches down, and the blanking force reaches a certain value in the place of blanking allowance value finally. With punch pushing the metal sheet to enter the plastic state and punch downward the place of the allowance value, the metal sheet sustained the big blanking force all the time as well as the deformation zone material keeps the plastic deformation.

Being an {{important}} blanking parameter, the blanking allowance of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance {{has a direct}} relationship {{with the quality of}} work piece and ejector force. The full process of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance for ASTM- 1022 in different blanking allowances is simulated through the finite element analysis software DEFORM- 2 D, then the ejector force under different blanking allowances is measured through the experiment of <b>fine-blanking</b> with negative clearance. Based on the analysis of the ejector force, the proportion of burnish band and the work piece fracture, the following conclusions are summarized. The size of blanking allowance is not related with the blanking force with the sheet entering plastic state and the maximum blanking force, and is only related with the ejector force. When the value of the blanking allowance is between 0. 1 mm and 0. 3 mm, the friction force between the punch-die and the sheet affects ejector force, and the ejector force is not related with the mechanical properties of material.

Besides, the varying tendency of the simulated effective strain was {{similar to that of the}} hardness value measured from experiment, reflecting that the hardened material layer on the blanked edge was just the result from the severe deformation in the blanking operation.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the characteristics of}} the combined <b>fine-blanking</b> and extrusion process and gives a detailed analysis of the process with the finite-element method. To carry out the simulation step by step and avoid the tendency to diverge in the calculations, the remeshing, tracing and golden section methods were developed and introduced into the finite-element program. Different boundary conditions were used in the simulation; the mesh distortion, field of material flow, and the stress and strain distributions were obtained. From the simulated results, the deformation characteristics under different boundary conditions were revealed. An experiment was also carried out to verify the simulated results. A large strain analysis technique was chosen to determine the effective strain distribution based on the experiment. The effective strain distributions from the simulation are in accordance with the effective strain distributions and the hardness distributions from the experiment.

30|$|A multi-row {{sprocket}} is {{a complicated}} part widely used in chain driving systems for mining machinery and equipment, such as scraper conveyers. The tooth profiles of multi-row sprockets are conventionally machined using a hobbing process, which wastes material and lowers their strength. Common failures of sprockets in the complex environment of a coal mine are excessive wears and tooth fractures (Wang et al. 2012). The chain and multi-row sprockets often bear larger static and dynamic loads in the impact-fluctuating work conditions of a scraper conveyer (Jiao et al. 2014). Therefore, improving the strength of multi-row sprocket plays an extremely {{important role in the}} driving system of mining equipment. Thipprakmas (2011) presented the <b>fine-blanking</b> process for manufacturing sprockets improving their strength with simple processing operations, reducing production time and costs. Takagi et al. (2009) used the technology of powder metallurgy to compact the housing sprocket while maintaining dimensional tolerances and strength. As a whole, the precision forging of multi-row sprockets is a complex process with severe plastic deformation (SPD) which improves the mechanical properties of forged parts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The hole quality {{on sheet}} metal parts is {{directly}} dependent on the die design and process parameters. In conventional piercing process, the secondary operations such as shaving, reaming and grinding are needed for manufacturing the precise-dimensioned holed parts without any cracks, resulting in the increase of both production time and costs. The fine-piercing process, referenced to the <b>fine-blanking</b> principle, is used to produce the precise-dimensioned holed parts with smooth-cut surfaces over the whole material thickness in a single operation. However, {{it is difficult to}} achieve the suitable die design and process parameters for meeting the part requirements. In this study, the die design by chamfering punch cutting edge was investigated on both the experiments and the finite-element method (FEM). The results were compared with the results obtained when the conventional die design with the punch cutting-edge radius was used. The FEM-simulation results showed the amount of die-roll, smooth-cut surface, and cracks agreed well with the experimental results. The results showed that an application of punch cutting-edge chamfer results in a superior fine-pierced hole surface could be achieved. Furthermore, the mechanism and effects of the punch cutting-edge chamfer have been theoretically clarified on basis of the material-flow analysis and stress distribution...|$|E
