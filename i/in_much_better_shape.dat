25|$|Many {{enterprises}} {{were taken}} over by the state or failed, small trade and production shops had to join cooperatives, but only a small proportion of peasant agriculture was made collective (over ten percent of the arable area) by {{the start of the war}} with Germany. Among the industrial installations dismantled and sent east were most of the Białystok textile industry factories. The results of the Soviet economic policies soon resulted in serious difficulties, as shops lacked goods, food was scarce and people were threatened by famine. Nevertheless, the conditions were better under the Soviets than in the German-run General Government. Industry was developed in Lviv and elsewhere and unemployment was officially eliminated by the spring of 1940. The living standards, following the initial collapse, kept gradually improving, many services were free or inexpensive and the poor and people with technical education fared better than under the Polish rule. The cities, of which Lviv and Białystok were particularly well-maintained by the Soviet authorities, were <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> than the countryside. The situation was very difficult for the Polish retirees, deprived of their pensions, and for the tens of thousands of war refugees who fled German-occupied Poland and settled in the eastern cities.|$|E

500|$|Histories {{during the}} Soviet era raised {{the battle to}} a mythic contest with serious {{political}} overtones and had Kutuzov as the master tactician on the battlefield, directing every move with the precision of a ballet master directing his troupe. Kutuzov's abilities on the battlefield were, {{in the eyes of}} his contemporaries and fellow Russian generals, far more complex and often described in less than flattering terms. Noted author and historian David G. Chandler writing in 1966, echoes the Soviet era Russian histories in more than a few ways, asserting that General Kutuzov remained in control of the battle throughout, ordered counter-moves to Napoleon's tactics personally rather than Bagration and Barclay doing so and put aside personal differences to overcome the dispositional mistakes of the Russian army. Nor is the tent scene played out; instead Kutuzov remains with the army. Chandler also has the Russian army <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> moving to secondary prepared positions and seriously considering attacking the next day. [...] Later historians Riehn and Mikaberidze have Kutuzov leaving most of the battle to Bagration and Barclay de Tolly, leaving early in the afternoon and relaying orders from his camp 30 minutes from the front.|$|E

The Japanese plan for the defence of the Philippines envisioned that the surviving carriers {{would be used to}} lure the American carrier forces away from the invasion area to a position where the carriers could be attacked by land-based aircraft and the transports {{by the rest of the}} IJN. The other carrier air groups were not <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> and the Japanese decided to retain the aircraft ashore for use against the American carriers. The Fourth Carrier Division was assigned to the Northern Force under the command of Vice Admiral Jisaburō Ozawa and the sisters sailed from Yashima on 20 October. On the morning of 24 October, the bulk of the few aircraft aboard were launched to attack the American carriers as a distraction. They inflicted no damage and caused the Americans to search in the direction from which they had attacked. The Americans finally spotted the Japanese carriers at 16:40, some [...] east of Cape Engaño, the northeastern tip of Luzon. The American carriers were spread out and it was very late in the day to launch an airstrike, so Admiral William Halsey, commander of the Third Fleet decided to mass his carriers in a position to attack the following morning. Ozawa reversed course during the night, correctly believing that the Americans would follow him north.|$|E

40|$|Document {{is based}} on a {{distinguished}} lecture held in Florence on 26 October 2011 by Yves Mersch, Governor of the Banque centrale du Luxembourg and Member of the Governing Council of the European Central BankSeveral euro area member states are under increased market scrutiny although public finances in the euro area as a bloc are <b>in</b> a <b>much</b> <b>better</b> <b>shape</b> than <b>in</b> the US or Japan. The main reason is that the euro area is an alliance of sovereign countries with most of the relevant political decisions - including public finance - being taken by national governments whereas the other major currencies are sovereign states with central governments and budgets. In the absence of a central government and an internal nominal exchange rate, effective rules are required to safeguard the stability of a currency area. The current crisis has disclosed the weaknesses of the institutional set up of the euro area. Europe has already undertaken major steps to tackle these. Challenges remain, however, to further proceed in the direction of an Optimum Currency Area...|$|R
40|$|The growing {{economic}} and financial momentum of many larger emerging economies, including China, raises serious questions for Western decision makers. Of central strategic concern is whether (several of) the emerging economies are likely to coalesce into an economic or political bloc (be it formal or informal) that might promote alternative approaches to global economic, diplomatic or security issues and develop a counterbalance to Western influence in existing economic, financial and political institutions. In the event that this counterbalancing results {{in the formation of}} a bloc of emerging countries, including coordinated challenges to limit Western influence or the development of alternative economic-financial regimes, European interests stand to suffer. The first decade of the 21 st century has indeed been a period of rapid economic growth in many large emerging economies, especially China. This has brought about substantial changes in the relative power balance between the emerging economies and the West. While the U. S. and many European economies are weighed down by sovereign debt and austerity measures that could condemn them to several years of slow growth, many emerging economies are <b>in</b> <b>much</b> <b>better</b> fiscal <b>shape</b> and have recovered quickly from the global recession. The emergence of a de facto bipolar world with ‘the West against the Rest’ could increase the costs of doing business, severely complicate reaching agreement on transnational problems such as climate change or resource security, potentially challenge the promotion of Western values and human rights, lead to increased diplomatic or military tensions and potentially jeopardize the ongoing process of economic globalization. This report summarizes the results of a study undertaken by The Hague Centre for Strategic Studies (HCSS) on behalf of TNO (Dutch Organization for Applied Scientific Research) to address some of the political, {{economic and}} security issues related to rapid growth of eight emerging economies, which we group as the BRICS+ in this study. Questions this study addresses include: could the BRICS+ (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa, Indonesia, South Korea and Turkey) pave the way toward a new economic or political bloc? What are the sources of influence of the emerging countries? In what ways has the rise of emerging economies affected the international power balance? To what extent are the emerging economies cooperating strategically on economic, diplomatic and security matters? And, how could bloc formation impact on economic opportunities for European firms in these emerging economies...|$|R
