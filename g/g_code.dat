40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to build a plotter for {{printing}} vector graphics on paper. The plotter is computer controlled by a Mach 3 program. Mach 3 is a control software for CNC (Computer Numerical Control) machines. The components of the plotter software are Mach 3 and a <b>G</b> <b>code</b> generating program. Mach 3 has {{a large amount of}} functions because it is intended for CNC machines. However many of these functions are not needed for the plotter.

STEP-NC goes much further that <b>G</b> <b>codes</b> {{and has a}} more comprehensive data model that overcomes the lack of process information in ISO 6983 files (<b>G</b> <b>codes</b> programming).
