25|$|In many clubs {{with longer}} meetings, {{particularly}} in Australia, the evaluation session is split {{up and the}} various parts are located closer to the action being evaluated.

In the recent MAPS 3 vote, the city's fraternal order of police criticized the project proposals for not doing enough to expand the police presence {{to keep up with the}} growing residential population and increased commercial activity. In September 2013, Oklahoma City area attorney David Slane announced he would pursue legal action regarding MAPS3, on claims the multiple projects that made up the plan violate a state constitutional law limiting voter ballot issues to a single subject.|$|E
25|$|Egyptian {{authorities}} have long expressed {{concern over the}} instability in eastern Libya spilling over into Egypt due {{to the rise of}} jihadist movements in the region, which the government believes to have developed into a safe transit for wanted Islamists following the 2013 coup d'état in Egypt that ousted Muslim Brotherhood-backed president Mohamed Morsi. There have been numerous attacks on Egypt's trade interests in Libya which were rampant prior to Haftar's offensive, especially with the kidnapping of truck drivers and sometimes workers were murdered. Due to this, the military-backed government in Egypt had many reasons to support Haftar's rebellion and the Islamist February 17th Martyrs Brigade operating in Libya has accused the Egyptian government of supplying Haftar with weapons and ammunition, a claim denied by both Cairo and the rebel leader. Furthermore, Egyptian President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has become increasingly popular among many Libyans wishing for stability, <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>on</b> the United States to intervene militarily in Libya during his presidential candidacy, warning that Libya was becoming a major security challenge and vowed not to allow the turmoil there to threaten Egypt's national security.|$|E
25|$|The document, {{published}} in December 2016, seeks for Scotland {{to remain a}} member of the European Single Market to allow the Economy of Scotland to benefit from free trade deals across the remaining 27 European Union nations. Furthermore, it seeks that remaining within the European Single Market would be beneficial for trade across the entire United Kingdom, whereby it benefits the economies of both Scotland and the United Kingdom as well as benefiting the wider economy and trade of the European Union. Within Scotland's Place in Europe, the Scottish Government highlights that there are several ways that Scotland could retain its membership of the European Single Market, but most notably by becoming an independent sovereign country within the EU which is the preferred option of Sturgeon and the wider SNP led-Scottish Government. Other than trade and single market membership, Sturgeon advocates the importance of the rights of EU nationals currently working and residing within Scotland and that there rights and liberties are protected post-Brexit. As immigration and border controls remain a reserved matter, Sturgeon <b>has</b> <b>called</b> <b>on</b> strong working with Prime Minister Theresa May and the UK Government to ensure this is achieved. Other issues set in the document include protection over laws and legislation which affects Scotland, protection of worker's rights and entitlements, a review of the devolution settlement in Scotland that will be affected by Brexit such as farming and fishery industries and additional powers granted to Scotland to protect and promote Scottish interests.|$|E

Jeffery Strelzin said in February 2009 that the investigation is still active. [...] "We don't know if Maura is a victim, but the state is treating it as a potential homicide.
