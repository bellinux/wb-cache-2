50|$|This {{material}} has been classified by the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) as a Group 2B carcinogen (possibly carcinogenic to humans). Animal carcinogenicity data for <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> show increased incidences of liver, kidney (renal tubular tumours) and thyroid cancers. Chronic oral exposure in humans {{has been shown}} to give rise to a liver disease (porphyria cutanea tarda), skin lesions with discoloration, ulceration, photosensitivity, thyroid effects, bone effects and loss of hair. Neurological changes have been reported in rodents exposed to <b>hexachlorobenzene.</b> <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> may cause embryolethality and teratogenic effects. Human and animal studies have demonstrated that <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> crosses the placenta to accumulate in foetal tissues and is transferred in breast milk.|$|E
50|$|Pentachlorobenzenethiol can be {{obtained}} from <b>hexachlorobenzene.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> is {{an animal}} {{carcinogen}} {{and is considered}} to be a probable human carcinogen. After its introduction as a fungicide in 1945, for crop seeds, this toxic chemical was found in all food types. <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> was banned from use in the United States in 1966.|$|E
50|$|In 2010, both {{countries}} {{made a deal}} to ship 6,100 ton <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> waste from Australia to Denmark.Greenpeace protested outside the Australian environment ministry to show {{their opposition to the}} shipment of <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> from Australia. On 23 December 2010, Danish Minister of Environment Karen Ellemann cancelled the deal because of the pressure.|$|E
50|$|Pentachlorobenzenethiol is a {{combustible}} gray solid with {{an unpleasant}} odor, practically insoluble in water. It has a monoclinic crystal structure. The compound is not well-biodegradable and presumably bioaccumulable and toxic for aquatic organisms. Pentachlorobenzenethiol {{is itself a}} metabolite of <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and {{is found in the}} urine and the excretions of animals receiving <b>hexachlorobenzene.</b> Pentachlorobenzenethiol has a high potential for long-range transport via air as it is very slowly degraded in atmosphere.|$|E
50|$|At {{least three}} types of {{synthetic}} toxins {{have been found in}} the semen of student volunteers: polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), DDT, and <b>hexachlorobenzene.</b> DDT and <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> are associated with decreased semen quality, while PCBs are associated with decreased fertility overall. Leaks of dibromochloropropane (DBCP) have caused sterility in men. Soldiers that were exposed to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds during the Vietnam war have given rise to children with an increased rate of birth defects.|$|E
50|$|There were {{initially}} twelve distinct chemicals listed in three categories. Two chemicals, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and polychlorinated biphenyls, were listed in both categories A and C.|$|E
50|$|Note: <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> is {{an animal}} {{carcinogen}} {{and is considered}} to be a probable human carcinogen. Its use is banned in the USA and in many other countries.|$|E
50|$|The ternary halides, such as A3TiCl6, have {{structures}} {{that depend on}} the cation (A+) added. Caesium chloride treated with titanium(II) chloride and <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> produces crystalline CsTi2Cl7. In these structures Ti3+ exhibits octahedral coordination geometry.|$|E
50|$|In California, DCPA {{products}} {{are required to}} be labeled with the information that products with DCPA also contain trace amounts of <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB) which is a chemical known to the State of California to cause cancer or birth defects.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexachlorobenzene,</b> or perchlorobenzene, is an {{organochloride}} {{with the}} molecular formula C6Cl6. It is a fungicide formerly {{used as a}} seed treatment, especially on wheat to control the fungal disease bunt. It has been banned globally under the Stockholm Convention on persistent organic pollutants.|$|E
50|$|A {{variety of}} {{compounds}} are considered as epigenetic carcinogens—they {{result in an}} increased incidence of tumors, {{but they do not}} show mutagen activity (toxic compounds or pathogens that cause tumors incident to increased regeneration should also be excluded). Examples include diethylstilbestrol, arsenite, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> and nickel compounds.|$|E
50|$|In World War II, Hooker was {{a leading}} {{supplier}} of dodecyl mercaptan for the synthesis of rubber. The company also produced arsenic trichloride, thionyl chloride, and <b>hexachlorobenzene.</b> Hooker expanded into plastics manufacturing capabilities, developing epoxy vinyl ester resins, and in 1955 acquiring a thermoset plastic phenolic resins business, called Durez Corp.|$|E
50|$|Karen Elleman is {{considered}} a controversial politician in Denmark due to the decision of importing 6,000 tons of highly toxic chemical waste HCB, also known as <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> from Australia. Karen Ellemann {{is convinced that the}} import is a good opportunity to expose Danish knowhow at its best in the process of handling the HCB waste.|$|E
5000|$|In the Stockholm Convention on POPs, {{which came}} into effect on 17 May 2004, twelve POPs were listed to be {{eliminated}} or their production and use restricted. The OCPs or pesticide-POPs identified on this list have been termed the [...] "dirty dozen" [...] and include aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> mirex, and toxaphene.|$|E
5000|$|The Point Aconi Generating Station consumes 189,000 tonnes of {{coal and}} 213,000 tonnes of {{petroleum}} coke {{per year and}} currently generates approximately 6.8% of the province's electricity and produces roughly 10.07% of the province's air pollution, including hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and mercury. [...] In 2007 it created 1.465 million tonnes of greenhouse gases.|$|E
50|$|Chlorothalonil can be {{produced}} by the direct chlorination of isophthalonitrile or by dehydration of tetrachloroisophthaloyl amide with phosphoryl chloride. It is a white solid. It breaks down under basic conditions, but is stable in neutral and acidic media. Technical grade chlorothalonil contains traces of dioxins and <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> a persistent organic pollutant banned under the Stockholm Convention.|$|E
5000|$|The plant burns {{coal and}} {{features}} two boilers and two chimneys; one 152 m (500 ft) and one 92 m (300 ft). [...] The plant consumes 0.8 million tonnes of coal {{per year and}} currently generates approximately 12% of the province's electricity and produces roughly 10% of the province's air pollution, including hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and mercury.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{studies have}} {{measured}} the effect, usually by correlating {{the concentrations of}} a certain chemical in air, water, or biological specimens from {{various parts of the}} world with the latitude from which the samples were collected. For example, the levels of PCBs, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> and lindane measured in water, lichens, and tree bark {{have been shown to be}} greater in higher latitudes.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB), {{was first}} {{introduced}} in 1945-1959 to treat seeds because it can kill fungi on food crops. HCB-treated seed grain consumption is associated with photosensitive skin lesions, colic, debilitation, and a metabolic disorder called porphyria turcica, which can be lethal. Mothers who pass HCB to their infants through the placenta and breast milk had limited reproductive success including infant death. Human exposure is primarily from food.|$|E
50|$|HCB is {{very toxic}} to aquatic organisms. It may cause long term adverse {{effects in the}} aquatic environment. Therefore, release into {{waterways}} should be avoided. It is persistent in the environment. Ecological investigations have found that biomagnification up the food chain does occur. <b>Hexachlorobenzene</b> has a half life in the soil of between 3 and 6 years. Risk of bioaccumulation in an aquatic species is high.|$|E
50|$|The plant burns {{coal and}} {{features}} four boilers and two 152 m (500 ft) chimneys. The plant consumes 1.5 million tonnes of coal {{per year and}} currently generates approximately twenty-five percent of the province's electricity, while producing roughly {{fifty percent of the}} province's air pollution, including hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and mercury. Emissions in the form of particulates are a frequent source of pollution complaints in the neighbourhood and region.|$|E
50|$|Among {{the most}} {{disruptive}} pesticides are those dubbed Persistent organic pollutants (POPs) {{which do not}} break down easily in the environment, or if they do they become something equally harmful. Because POPs represent such a threat to organisms within an environment, especially those higher on a food chain, specific international legislation {{referred to as the}} Stockholm Convention banned several of them being used. Some of these pollutants are DDT, aldrin, chlordane, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> and toxaphene.|$|E
50|$|PCNB was {{originally}} synthesized {{in the laboratory}} in 1868. It {{was introduced to the}} agricultural world in the 1930s in Germany by Bayer AG as a substitute to mercurial pesticides. PCNB is prepared by chlorination of nitrobenzene at 60-70 °C in chlorosulfuric acid, with iodine as a catalyst. It can also be produced by the nitration of chlorinated benzenes. A side product of the synthesis of PCNB is <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB), which is considered as hazardous as PCNB.|$|E
50|$|Well before this, Australia {{had been}} well {{advanced}} {{in meeting the}} measures agreed upon under the Convention. Production, import and use of aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB), heptachlor, endrin, and toxaphene are not permitted in Australia. Production and importation of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are not permitted in Australia, with the phase-out of existing PCBs being managed under the National Strategy for the Management of Scheduled Waste. This strategy also addresses how Australia will manage HCB waste and organochlorine pesticides.|$|E
50|$|Millions of litres {{of toxic}} {{chemicals}} are estimated to have seeped through the sandy soils and into the aquifer, which {{is used as a}} water source for industry and residents. Levels of chemicals such as <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and ethylene dichloride are at 5000 times their safe levels in some placesTesting in 1994 demonstrated levels of ethylene dichloride as high as 6,800 mg/L was present in the groundwater and the plumes are moving in a southerly direction {{at a rate of about}} 90 m per year.|$|E
50|$|In 1934 Lonsdale {{returned}} to work with Bragg at the Royal Institution as a researcher. She was awarded a DSc from University College London in 1936 while at the Royal Institution. In addition to discovering the structure of benzene and <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> Lonsdale worked on the synthesis of diamonds. She was {{a pioneer in the}} use of X-rays to study crystals. Lonsdale one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (the other was the biochemist Marjory Stephenson).|$|E
5000|$|Currently, she is {{a member}} of the {{parliamentary}} faction of the party [...] "People's Front", also member of the Verkhovna Rada Committee on national security and defense. Deputy Chairman of the Interim Commission of the Verkhovna Rada of Ukraine on investigation of the theft of public funds in 2011-2014, when providing services of collecting hazardous <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> waste in Kalush district, Ivano-Frankivsk region; Deputy Member of the Permanent Delegation to the Parliamentary Assembly of the Black Sea Economic Cooperation Organization; member of the inter-parliamentary relations with China.|$|E
50|$|The plant burns {{coal and}} {{features}} a single boiler and two chimneys, the taller {{of which is}} 107 m high. There are, however, taller structures in the area; the windmills of the Point Tupper Wind Farm, which are approximately 125 m feet high. It consumes 400,000 tonnes of coal per year and currently generates approximately 6% of the province's electricity, while producing roughly 10.7% of the province's air pollution, including hydrochloric acid, sulphuric acid, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> and mercury. In 2008 the Point Tupper Generating Station created 1.05 million tons of greenhouse gases.|$|E
50|$|Persistent organic {{pollutants}} (POPs) are compounds that resist degradation and thus {{remain in the}} environment for years. Some pesticides, including aldrin, chlordane, DDT, dieldrin, endrin, heptachlor, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> mirex and toxaphene, are considered POPs. Some POPs {{have the ability to}} volatilize and travel great distances through the atmosphere to become deposited in remote regions. Such chemicals may have the ability to bioaccumulate and biomagnify and can bioconcentrate (i.e. become more concentrated) up to 70,000 times their original concentrations. POPs can affect non-target organisms in the environment and increase risk to humans by disruption in the endocrine, reproductive, and immune systems.|$|E
50|$|The National Emissions Inventory in the U.S. and the Air Pollutant Emission Inventory (APEI) in Canada compile annual {{emissions}} of air pollutants {{that contribute to}} smog, acid rain, greenhouse gases and diminished air quality including particulate matter (PM), sulphur oxides (SOx), nitrogen oxides (NOx), cadmium, lead, mercury, and persistent organic pollutants (POPs) such as dioxins and furans, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH). In addition, the Toxics Release Inventory (TRI) is a publicly available database maintained by the EPA's TRI Program that tracks the management in the U.S. of certain toxic chemicals that may {{pose a threat to}} human health and the environment.|$|E
50|$|Dame Kathleen Lonsdale, DBE, FRS (née Yardley; 28 January 1903 - 1 April 1971) was a British {{crystallographer}} who proved, in 1929, {{that the}} benzene ring is flat by using X-ray diffraction methods to elucidate {{the structure of}} hexamethylbenzene. She {{was the first to}} use Fourier spectral methods while solving the structure of <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> in 1931. During her career she attained several firsts for female scientists, including being one of the first two women elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1945 (along with Marjory Stephenson), first woman tenured professor at University College London, first woman president of the International Union of Crystallography, and first woman president of the British Association for the Advancement of Science.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} a ductile {{molecular}} solid, that can be bent 180°, is <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB). In this example the π-π interactions between the benzene cores are stronger than the halogen interactions of the chlorides. This difference leads to its flexibility. This flexibility is anisotropic; to bend HCB to 180° you must stress the 001 face of the crystal. Another {{example of a}} flexible molecular solid is 2-(methylthio)nicotinic acid (MTN). MTN is flexible due to its strong hydrogen bonding and π-π interactions creating a rigid set of dimers that dislocate along the alignment of their terminal methyls. When stressed on the 010 face this crystal will bend 180°. Note, not all ductile molecular solids bend 180° and some may {{have more than one}} bending faces.|$|E
5000|$|In the U.S., total {{industrial}} {{releases of}} toxic waste into the air were 690 million pounds (313,000 tonnes) in 2015 and pulp and paper accounted for 20%. [...] Of the releases to air by the pulp and paper industry, 60% were methanol {{which is not a}} persistent, bioaccumulative, and toxic (PBT) chemical and is not a carcinogen. Several PBTs are emitted by the pulp and paper industry at measurable levels, including lead, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (HCB), dioxins, furans and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In Canada emissions of these chemicals by the industry were less than 2% of total emissions in 2015. In the U.S., the pulp and paper industry accounted for 22% of total HCB emissions but other PBT emissions were under 2% of national totals.|$|E
50|$|To control {{termites}} {{that attack}} dead material, <b>hexachlorobenzene,</b> {{also known as}} benzene hexachloride-BCH, {{can be applied to}} the vetiver hedge. Brown spot seems to have no effect on vetiver growth. Black rust in India is vetiver-specific and does not cross-infect other plants. In China, stemborers (Chilo spp.) have been recognised, but they seem to die once they get into the stems. Further, vetiver is affected by Didymella andropogonis on leaves, Didymosphaeria andropogonis on dead culms, Lulworthia medusa on culms and Ophiosphaerella herpotricha. Only in Malaysia, whiteflies seem to be a problem. Pest management is done not only by using insecticides, but also by appropriate cultural management: hedges are cut to 3 cm above ground at the end of the growing season. In general, vetiver is highly tolerant to herbicides and pesticides.|$|E
5000|$|Chlorine donors. Used {{together}} with colorants. In some cases, the color emitting species is molecular and not atomic. Such {{is the case}} for blue pyrotechnic flames where the emitting species is copper monochloride. Also, some chloride molecular emitters are much stronger than oxides of the same element, {{as in the case of}} Barium and Strontium. Polyvinyl chloride, polyvinylidene chloride, Saran, chlorinated paraffins, chlorinated rubber (e.g. Parlon), hexachloroethane, <b>hexachlorobenzene</b> (most common chlorine donor until the 1970s, now rarely used), and some other organochlorides and inorganic chlorides (e.g. ammonium chloride, mercurous chloride) are used as chlorine donors. Perchlorates and chlorates play this role {{together with}} their main use as oxidizers. Chlorine donors are often used also in smoke compositions, e.g. hexachloroethane together with zinc oxide to produce smoke based on zinc chloride.|$|E
