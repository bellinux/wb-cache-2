When you give a present of diamonds to a lady, she {{is not likely to}} call for polarized light and refracting liquids {{and the rest of the}} circus. In ninety-nine cases out of a hundred, she will take the things on trust. Very well. You trotted off to a jeweler, and put the thing to him confidentially. I guess you suggested paste. But, being a wily person, he pointed out that paste has a habit of not wearing well. It is pretty enough when it's new, but quite a small amount of ordinary wear and tear destroys the polish of the surface and the sharpness of the cutting. It gets scratched easily. Having heard this, and reflecting that Lady Julia was not likely to keep the necklace under a glass case, you rejected paste as too risky. The genial jeweler then suggested white <b>jargoon,</b> mentioning, as I have done, that, after an application or so of the blow-pipe, it's own mother wouldn't know it. If he was a bit of an antiquary, he probably added that, in the eighteenth century, <b>jargoon</b> stones were supposed to be actually an inferior sort of diamond. What could be more suitable? 'Make it <b>jargoon,</b> dear heart,' you cried joyfully, and all was well. Am I right? I notice that you have not corrected me so far." ...|$|E
6000|$|There are {{witnesses}} who can testify that I have used no artifice. I have, on the contrary, cut away priceless slabs of opus alexandrinum. My gold I have lacquered down to dull bronze, my purples overlaid with sepia of the sea, and for hell-hearted ruby and blinding diamond I have substituted pale amethyst and mere <b>jargoon.</b> Because I would say again [...] "Disregarding the inventions of the Marine Captain whose other name is Gubbins, let a plain statement suffice." ...|$|E

Imitation pearls on the arches and base were replaced with gold beads which at the time were platinum-plated. It was also made smaller to fit George V, the first monarch to be crowned with St Edward's Crown in over 200 years. On 4 June 2013, the crown was displayed on the altar in Westminster Abbey to mark the 60th anniversary of Queen Elizabeth II's coronation [...] - [...] the first time that it had left the Jewel House at the Tower of London since 1953.|$|R
6000|$|... "How did I know?" [...] he repeated. [...] "If {{you mean}} what first made me suspect, I couldn't tell you. It {{might have been}} one of a score of things. A jeweler can't say exactly how he gets on the track of fake stones. He can feel them. He can almost smell them. I worked with a jeweler once. That's how I got my {{knowledge}} of jewels. But, if you mean, can I prove what I say about this necklace, that's easy. There's no deception. It's simple. See here. These stones are supposed to be diamonds. Well, the diamond is the hardest stone in existence. Nothing will scratch it. Now, I've got a little ruby, out of a college pin, which I know is genuine. By rights, then, that ruby ought not to have scratched these stones. You follow that? But it did. It scratched two of them, the only two I tried. If you like, I can continue the experiment. But there's no need. I can tell you right now what these stones are, I said they were paste, but that wasn't quite accurate. They're a stuff called white <b>jargoon.</b> It's a stuff that's very easily faked. You work it with the flame of a blow-pipe. You don't want a full description, I suppose? Anyway, what happens is that the blow-pipe sets it up like a tonic. Gives it increased specific gravity and a healthy complexion and all sorts of great things of that kind. Two minutes in the flame of a blow-pipe is like a week at the seashore to a bit of white <b>jargoon.</b> Are you satisfied? If it comes to that, I guess you can hardly be expected to be. Convinced is a better word. Are you convinced, or do you hanker after tests like polarized light and refracting liquids?" ...|$|E
5000|$|<b>Jargoon</b> or jargon (occasionally in old {{writings}} jargounce and jacounce) {{is a name}} {{applied by}} gemologists to those zircons which are fine enough to be cut as gemstones, but are not of the red color which characterizes the hyacinth or jacinth. The word is related to Persian zargun (zircon;zar-gun, [...] "gold-like" [...] or [...] "as gold"). Some of the finest jargoons are green, others brown and yellow, whilst some are colorless. The colorless <b>jargoon</b> may be obtained by heating certain colored stones. When zircon is heated it sometimes changes in color, or altogether loses it, {{and at the same}} time usually increases in density and brilliancy. The so-called Matura diamonds, formerly sent from Matara (or Matura), in Sri Lanka, were decolorized zircons. The zircon has strong refractive power, and its lustre is almost adamantine, but it lacks the fire of the diamond. The specific gravity of zircon is subject to considerable variation in different varieties; thus Sir A. H. Church found the specific gravity of a fine leaf-green <b>jargoon</b> to be as low as 3.982, and that of a pure white <b>jargoon</b> as high as 4.705. <b>Jargoon</b> and tourmaline, when cut as gems, are sometimes mistaken for each other, but the specific gravity is distinctive, since that of tourmaline is only 3.103. Moreover, in tourmaline the dichroism is strongly marked, whereas in <b>jargoon</b> it is remarkably feeble. The refractive indices of <b>jargoon</b> are much higher than those of tourmaline.|$|E
