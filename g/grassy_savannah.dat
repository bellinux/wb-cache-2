50|$|The habitat {{consists}} of <b>grassy</b> <b>savannah.</b> The larvae feed on Acacia species.|$|E
50|$|The {{breeding}} {{habitat is}} wet <b>grassy</b> <b>savannah</b> {{for the northern}} form, peat bogs for magellanicae, and boggy rivers for andina. The nest is a well-hidden depression on the ground. Both parents incubate the two buff eggs for about 19 days to hatching, the precocial young leaving the nest soon after hatching.|$|E
50|$|Vegetation {{includes}} deciduous xerophytic forests, palm groves, <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs,</b> <b>grassy</b> steppes and bushy steppes. Plants of the Prosopis and Acacia genera of the Mimosoideae {{family are}} common, add the mature forest areas {{are dominated by}} trees of the Prosopis genus.Other plants belong to genera such as Jodina (Santalaceae family), Celtis, Schinus, Geoffroea and Atamisquea (Capparaceae family).|$|R
5000|$|Ancylotherium's habitat was the savannahs of East and South Africa. As an herbivore, {{it evolved}} to browse on {{vegetation}} {{on the trees}} in the <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs</b> of Africa. Ancylotherium's closest relatives are the other perissodactyls, or [...] "odd-toed" [...] ungulates, including the extinct brontotheres and modern-day mammals such as horses, tapirs, and rhinoceroses.|$|R
60|$|It rained on the {{following}} morning; after which we left for the exit of the Teesta, proceeding northwards, sometimes through a dense forest of Sal timber, sometimes dipping into marshy depressions, or riding through <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs,</b> breast-high. The coolness of the atmosphere was delicious, {{and the beauty of}} the jungle seemed to increase the further we penetrated these primaeval forests.|$|R
50|$|For {{the past}} few decades, the {{population}} of this species has declined; the southern subspecies has been declared threatened in New South Wales, and vulnerable in Queensland, and appears to have vanished from 80% of its former range. The reason for the declined population is probably due to spread of pastoralism, changes in fire regime and increases in the density of native woody weeds in <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs.</b> A national management plan was published in 2004 by the New South Wales and Queensland governments.|$|R
50|$|Cirsium lecontei {{occurs on}} the sandy pinelands of {{southern}} coastal plain in damp soil(where co-occurring species include Myrica, Cyrilla, and Ilex), {{specifically in the}} states of Alabama, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina and South Carolina. They are also found in moist to wet <b>grassy</b> pine <b>savannahs</b> and pine barrens, bogs(other species present include pitcher plants, Ilex, sedges, grasses, and sphagnum), and roadside ditches.|$|R
60|$|Having {{returned}} to Titalya, Mr. Hodgson and I {{set off in}} an eastern direction for the Teesta river, whose embouchure from {{the mountains to the}} plains I was anxious to visit. Though the weather is hot, and oppressively so {{in the middle of the}} day, there are few climates more delicious than that of these <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs</b> from December to March. We always started soon after daybreak on ponies, and enjoyed a twelve to sixteen miles' gallop in the cool of the morning before breakfast, which we found prepared on our arrival at a tent sent on ahead the night before. The road led across an open country, or followed paths through interminable rice-fields, now dry and dusty. On poor soil a white-flowered Leucas monopolized the space, like our charlock and poppy: it was apparently a pest to the agriculturist, covering the surface in some places like a sprinkling of snow. Sometimes the river-beds exposed fourteen feet of pure stratified sand, with only an inch of vegetable soil above.|$|R
40|$|The {{contribution}} of biofuels to the saving {{of greenhouse gas}} (GHG) emissions has recently been questioned because of emissions resulting from land use change (LUC) for bioenergy feedstock production. We investigate how {{the inclusion of the}} carbon effect of LUC into the carbon accounting framework, as scheduled by the European Commission, impacts on land use choices for an expanding biofuel feedstock production. We first illustrate the change in the carbon balances of various biofuels, using methodology and data from the IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories. It becomes apparent that the conversion of natural land, apart from <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs,</b> impedes meeting the EU’s 35 % minimum emissions reduction target for biofuels. We show that the current accounting method mainly promotes biofuel feedstock production on former cropland, thus increasing the competition between food and fuel production on the currently available cropland area. We further discuss whether it is profitable to use degraded land for commercial bioenergy production as requested by the European Commission to avoid undesirable LUC and conclude that the current regulation provides little incentive to use such land. The exclusive consideration of LUC for bioenergy production minimizes direct LUC at the expense of increasing indirect LUC. land use change emissions, bioenergy, European policy, Land Economics/Use, Resource /Energy Economics and Policy,...|$|R
50|$|Woolly giant rats {{inhabit the}} cerrado of central Brazil, and the Llanos de Moxos of {{northern}} Bolivia between 60 and 750 m elevation. Within Brazil, they are recorded {{from the states}} of Goiás, Mato Grosso and Rondônia. The rats live in areas of open grassland, <b>grassy</b> shrub, and <b>savannah</b> woodland, and are not found in more densely forested habitats.|$|R
40|$|Paleoecological and geomorphological studies {{indicate}} that, {{during the middle}} Holocene, there was a predominance of drier conditions with <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs</b> replacing forests across the South American continent. Modern savannahs are composed mainly of C 4 plants and soils developed under this type of vegetation show enrichment in C- 13 compared to soils under C 3 vegetation cover, If soils contain stabilized organic matter formed in the middle Holocene, we hypothesize that former C 4 vegetation would be evidenced by a large enrichment of C- 13 in soil organic matter (SOM). We investigate this possibility examining the depth variation of carbon isotopic pic composition in 21 soil profiles collected by different researchers at 14 different sites in Brazil, Of these, profiles from only three sites showed a marked increase of C- 13 with depth (9 - 10 parts per thousand enrichment in delta(13) C difference between the surface soil and deepest depth); two sites showed intermediate enrichment (4 - 5 parts per thousand), and nine sites showed a small enrichment of approximatelly 2. 5 parts per thousand. The majority of sites showing all-C 3 derived SOM were in the Amazon region. Possible causes {{for the absence of}} a large C- 13 enrichment with depth are: (1) dominance of C 3 rather than C 4 grasses in mid-Holocene savannahas, (2) soil profiles did not preserve organic matter derived from mid-Holocene plants, (3) the retreat of forest areas did not occur on a regional scale, but was a much more localized phenomenon...|$|R
50|$|The Dunia Engine allows complex {{sequences}} and run-events during gameplay; {{the game}} features a day-and-night cycle, {{as well as}} tree and vegetation regeneration. A unique fire propagation mechanism, which allows a small fire to spread and eventually cause large brush fires, may be used either to the player's advantage during combat or against the player. The behavior of fire is dependent on factors such as wind speed, wind direction, rain, and vegetation type. For example, a fire may not spread as easily in a lush, moist jungle environment compared to dry, <b>grassy</b> plains and <b>savannahs.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{striped owl}} {{is native to}} much of South and Central America. Its range is not well known, perhaps because it is nocturnal and not easily seen, but it is known from Argentina, Belize, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, El Salvador, French Guiana, Guatemala, Guyana, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Panama, Paraguay, Peru, Suriname, Trinidad and Tobago, Uruguay and Venezuela. It uses a variety of habitats, {{including}} riparian woodlands, marshes, <b>savannahs,</b> <b>grassy</b> open areas, and tropical rainforests. It can be found from sea level to 1600 m and above.|$|R
60|$|The number, tameness, and disgusting {{habits of}} the carrion-feeding hawks of South America make them pre-eminently {{striking}} to any one accustomed only to the birds of Northern Europe. In this list may be included four species of the Caracara or Polyborus, the Turkey buzzard, the Gallinazo, and the Condor. The Caracaras are, from their structure, placed among the eagles: we shall soon see how ill they become so high a rank. In their habits they well supply the place of our carrion-crows, magpies, and ravens; a tribe of birds widely distributed {{over the rest of}} the world, but entirely absent in South America. To begin with the Polyborus Brasiliensis: this is a common bird, and has a wide geographical range; it is most numerous on the <b>grassy</b> <b>savannahs</b> of La Plata (where it goes by the name of Carrancha), and is far from unfrequent throughout the sterile plains of Patagonia. In the desert between the rivers Negro and Colorado, numbers constantly attend the line of road to devour the carcasses of the exhausted animals which chance to perish from fatigue and thirst. Although thus common in these dry and open countries, and likewise on the arid shores of the Pacific, it is nevertheless found inhabiting the damp impervious forests of West Patagonia and Tierra del Fuego. The Carranchas, together with the Chimango, constantly attend in numbers the estancias and slaughtering-houses. If an animal dies on the plain the Gallinazo commences the feast, and then the two species of Polyborus pick the bones clean. These birds, although thus commonly feeding together, are far from being friends. When the Carrancha is quietly seated on the branch of a tree or on the ground, the Chimango often continues for a long time flying backwards and forwards, up and down, in a semicircle, trying each time {{at the bottom of the}} curve to strike its larger relative. The Carrancha takes little notice, except by bobbing its head. Although the Carranchas frequently assemble in numbers, they are not gregarious; for in desert places they may be seen solitary, or more commonly by pairs.|$|R
