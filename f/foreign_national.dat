40|$|AbstractOver {{the last}} decade, {{the number of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> in Spain has increased. Our aim was to report the trends in {{hospital}} admissions, differentiating between <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from high-income countries (HICs) and from low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) in a public hospital. A retrospective analysis of hospital admissions in patients aged ⩾ 15 years between 2000 and 2012 was performed by means of hospital information systems at a public hospital {{in the city of}} Alicante, Spain. During the period of the study, 387, 862 patients were admitted: 32, 020 (8. 3 %) were foreign, 22, 446 (5. 8 %) were from LMICs, and 9574 (2. 5 %) were from HICs. The number of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals,</b> <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs, and <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from HICs admitted increased from 1019, 530, and 489 in 2000 to 2925, 2097, and 828, respectively in 2012. A total of 27. 5 % of patients were admitted for pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, especially <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs (34. 3 %), and 14. 1 % of <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> were admitted for cardiovascular diseases (14. 1 %), which were more common in those from HICs (26. 3 %). The number of admissions among <b>foreign</b> <b>nationals</b> from LMICs increased significantly in all the diagnoses, but in pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium, the increase was higher. In conclusion, nearly one out of 10 adult patients admitted to our hospital was foreign, mainly from LMICs, and the main reason for admission was diagnoses related to pregnancy, childbirth, and puerperium...|$|R
