25|$|Because the {{electrostatic}} discharge of terrestrial lightning superheats {{the air to}} plasma temperatures {{along the length of}} the <b>discharge</b> <b>channel</b> in a short duration, kinetic theory dictates gaseous molecules undergo a rapid increase in pressure and thus expand outward from the lightning creating a shock wave audible as thunder. Since the sound waves propagate not from a single point source but {{along the length of the}} lightning's path, the sound origin's varying distances from the observer can generate a rolling or rumbling effect. Perception of the sonic characteristics is further complicated by factors such as the irregular and possibly branching geometry of the lightning channel, by acoustic echoing from terrain, and by the typically multiple-stroke characteristic of the lightning strike.|$|E

Although previous {{work in this area}} has produced three-dimensional (3 D) information of <b>discharge</b> <b>channels,</b> {{there has not been a}} method to visualise the channel and the characteristics of its shape in a 3 D environment. In the research presented, photographed <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> are reconstructed in a virtual interactive 3 D envi- ronment. It is found that single-channelled discharges produce models that correctly follow the inferred channel paths from the photograph datasets. Single-channelled discharges have also been veri ed in the controlled laboratory environment, providing con - dence in the two-image reconstruction algorithm. The algorithm is shown to fail for an angular separation of cameras less than 15, which produces thicker channel segments. It is further shown that branched <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> can produce models that correctly follow the channel paths. If images are not accurately normalised for lens correction and slight camera tilts, missing segments and duplication of reconstructed branches are evident in the models. Furthermore, it is shown that the algorithm also fails for image perspectives with angular separations less than 15, additional redundant branches are produced in addition to thicker channel segments...|$|R
25|$|Lightning is a {{dramatic}} natural example of static discharge. While the details are unclear and remain a subject of debate, the initial charge separation {{is thought to be}} associated with contact between ice particles within storm clouds. In general, significant charge accumulations can only persist in regions of low electrical conductivity (very few charges free to move in the surroundings), hence the flow of neutralizing charges often results from neutral atoms and molecules in the air being torn apart to form separate positive and negative charges, which travel in opposite directions as an electric current, neutralizing the original accumulation of charge. The static charge in air typically breaks down in this way at around 10,000 volts per centimeter (10 kV/cm) depending on humidity. The discharge superheats the surrounding air causing the bright flash, and produces a shock wave causing the clicking sound. The lightning bolt is simply a scaled-up version of the sparks seen in more domestic occurrences of static discharge. The flash occurs because the air in the <b>discharge</b> <b>channel</b> is heated to such a high temperature that it emits light by incandescence. The clap of thunder {{is the result of the}} shock wave created as the superheated air expands explosively.|$|E
500|$|Sunita Narain, the {{director}} of the Centre for Science and Environment (CSE) think tank, said the unprecedented floods in the Chennai metropolitan region were the direct result of unregulated urbanisation. According to Narain, [...] "our urban sprawls such as Delhi, Kolkata, Mumbai, Chennai, Srinagar, etc., have not paid adequate attention to the natural water bodies that exist in them. In Chennai, each of its lakes has a natural flood <b>discharge</b> <b>channel</b> which drains the spillover. But we have built over many of these water bodies, blocking the smooth flow of water. We have forgotten the art of drainage. We only see land for buildings, not for water." [...] According to research conducted by CSE, Chennai had over 600 lakes in the 1980s, but a master plan published in 2008 showed only a fraction of them to be in a healthy condition. State records have shown the total area of 19 major lakes shrank from 1,130 hectares in the 1980s to around 645 hectares in the early 2000s, reducing their storage capacity.|$|E

In this study, we make a series of plausible assumptions about the temperature and concentration of reactant species in the environment of discharges and we postulate a {{mechanism by}} which ice crystals are able to adsorb nitrogen atoms. We then compare production rates between uncatalyzed and catalytic reactions at 2000 K, 3000 K, and 4000 K.

40|$|High current <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> are an {{interesting}} alternative for the transport of intense ion beams. A sufficiently dense plasma can neutralize both beam-space charge and current and provides a strong focusing magnetic field all the way along the <b>channel.</b> Laser initiated <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> were subject to detailed investigations {{in the past few}} years at GSI [1, 2]. Recently, stable discharges were alternativley initiated by an ion-beam pulse from the UNILAC, which creates a trace of seed electrons in a gas fill of a few mbar along the desired path of breakdown. The discharge chamber is integrated into the beamline by a multi-stage differential pumping system. A beam mask with a single 2 mm diameter circular hole, aligned exactly to the channel axis prepares a narrow ion-beamlet of 11. 4 AMeV Ni 12 + ions, which defines the size of the ionization channel. First experiments produced stable, free-standing 50 cm long <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> in ammonia and argon with currents of up to 55 kA. The discharge is triggered 20 µs after the beginning of a 50 µs long macro pulse with an electric current of less than 5 µA inside the metallic 60 cm diameter discharge chamber. A low energy electric prepulse can optionally be applied before the high current discharge, to stabilize the channels. An upper limit for the electron density induced by the beam, can be estimated from the total energy loss of the beam in the gas. At this current and a gas pressure of 10 mbar the total energy loss of the beam in ammonia during 20 µs is around 10 14 eV/cm 3. Neglecting recombination of free electrons and assuming that the whole energy is used to ionize only electrons with the lowest ionization potential, the maximum electron density becomes roughly 10 13 cm − 3. Although the real density can be one or two orders of magnitude lower, the value is comparable or even higher than the electron densities produced by UV-laser induced ionization of organic molecules, which was used so far for the initiation of <b>discharge</b> <b>channels</b> [3] The dis-x (mm...|$|R
