It comprises a two-way hybrid waveguide-SIW E-plane divider and an unequal SIW <b>dividing</b> <b>network.</b> Firstly, the two-way hybrid divider is developed to realize the waveguide-to-SIW vertical transition and power division at the same time. Besides, it has a wider bandwidth and more compact configuration {{compared with those of}} conventional structures including a transition and a cascading divider. Secondly, an SIW 1 -to- 16 -way unequal <b>dividing</b> <b>network</b> is developed with the phase self-compensation ability. This W-band <b>dividing</b> <b>network</b> is able to generate the desired amplitude and phase distribution. Finally, two back-to-back SIW 16 × 16 antenna arrays are grouped and fed by the proposed feeding network. The low sidelobe levels (SLLs) can be achieved at E- and H-plane of the antenna. The total aperture size of the antenna is 15 % less than that of a conventional antenna with a separated divider and a transition. With such a multifunctional feeding network, the antenna is able to achieve low loss and high efficiency as well...|$|E

After <b>dividing</b> <b>network</b> into some communities with a certain community identification method, we give paths of all pairs of nodes based on communities aiming at reducing the betweenness of the nodes at the boundary of the communities.

The tuning layer augments this core with algorithms that aim at automatically guiding networks toward desired conditions.

40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that High Performance Computing (HPC) systems {{are most frequently}} used by multiple users for batch job, parallel computations. Less well known, however, are the numerous HPC systems servicing data so sensitive that administrators enforce either a) sequential job processing- only one job at a time on the entire system, or b) physical separation- devoting an entire HPC system to a single project until recommissioned. The driving forces behind this type of security are numerous but share the common origin of data so sensitive that measures above and beyond industry standard are used to ensure information security. This paper presents a network security solution that provides information security above and beyond industry standard, yet still enabling multi-user computations on the system. This paper’s main contribution is a mechanism designed to enforce high level time division multiplexing of network access (Time Division Multiple Access, or TDMA) according to security groups.

40|$|Abstract – This paper {{describes}} algorithms for the distributed computation {{of electromagnetic}} transients {{in a power}} system. Conventional simulators based on parallel computing utilize traveling-time delays due to Bergeron’s representation of transmission lines in order to <b>divide</b> the <b>network</b> of interest into subnetworks, and each subnetwork is assigned to a single CPU to solve the decoupled sets of the circuit equations in parallel. However, if a large subnetwork which cannot be divided further by a transmission line is found, this limits the overall performance of the simulator. In {{the case of a}} realtime simulator, this forces a large time step. To solve this bottleneck, two algorithms are described in this paper. One <b>divides</b> the <b>network</b> at series inductors and the other at shunt capacitors (series and shunt with respect to the ground). Since series inductors and shunt capacitors are found in many locations in a power system, the algorithms increase the possibility for <b>dividing</b> a <b>network</b> into subnetworks achieving optimal computational load assignment to the CPUs in a parallel computer...|$|R
