We also show that <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> a large fine boosts compliance more than <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> a small fine, but that the influence of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> both large and small fines decays sharply over time...|$|R

This study {{evaluated}} how prior <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> artificial fruits containing peach and/or guabiroba pulp influenced the ovipositing behavior of A. fraterculus. Insects 15 - 21 days old were exposed to four treatments: 1) <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> guabiroba, Campomanesia xanthocarpa O. Berg (Myrtaceae); 2) <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> peach, Prunus persica (L.) Batsch (Chimarrita cultivar; Rosaceae); 3) <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> both fruits; and 4) no experience (naive).

40|$|In the Contingent Valuation Method (CVM), {{both the}} {{goods being valued}} and the payment {{vehicles}} used to value them are mostly hypothetical. However, although numerous {{studies have examined the}} impact of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the good on the willingness to pay, less attention has been given to <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> the payment vehicles. This paper examines how <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> payment vehicles influences responses to a CV scenario on the maintenance of irrigation canals. Specifically, the paper uses a split-sample survey to investigate the effects of <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> monetary and labour payment vehicles on the acceptance of a CV scenario and protest bids. Using convergent validity tests, we found that experience acquired from using both monetary and labour payment vehicles reduces the asymmetries in acceptance rates. These findings suggest that <b>experience</b> <b>with</b> payment vehicles reduces time/money response asymmetries in the CVM. contingent valuation; payment vehicles; numéraires; experience...|$|R

5|$|Scandal, {{released}} by Shochiku in April 1950, {{was inspired by}} the director's personal <b>experiences</b> <b>with,</b> and anger towards, Japanese yellow journalism.
