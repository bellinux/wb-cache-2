50|$|In mid-to late 2014, the warthog exhibit {{was closed}} down and renovated to house Aldabra <b>tortoises</b> and {{juvenile}} <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises,</b> who were previously behind-the-scenes exclusive animals.|$|R
40|$|Digestive {{strategies}} {{have been recognized}} {{to be a key}} factor for healthy growth in juvenile <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Geochelone nigra). The aim of present study was to investigate digestive coefficients with special regard to fiber fractions. Four captive bred <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> 4 - 5 years of age were fed a controlled diet for 32 days. The diet consisted of 77 % hay, 15 % tortoise pellets, and 8 % apples on a dry matter basis. On a dry matter basis diet analysis showed: 95. 7 % organic matter, 11. 3 % crude protein, 20. 5 % crude fiber, 22. 6 % acid detergent fiber, 5. 0 % acid detergent lignin, and 17. 6 % cellulose. Based on total fecal collection during 7 days average dry matter digestibilities were calculated: 65 % for dry matter, 67 % for organic matter, 63 % for crude protein, 55 % for crude fiber, 49 % for acid detergent fiber, 41 % for acid detergent lignin, 54 % for cellulose. An increase in crude fiber content resulted in a reduced digestibility in comparative evaluations of data for different tortoise species, and in a comparison of tortoises and mammalian hindgut fermenters. Compared to some mammalian hindgut-fermenting herbivore species (domestic horses, Asian elephants, Indian rhinoceroses) on a diet of hay and concentrates, the juvenile <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> showed a digestion of similar efficiency. If a reduction in dietary digestibility is warranted in juvenile <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises,</b> it is concluded that dietary fiber levels should be increased and it is proposed that crude fiber levels of 30 - 40 % on a dry matter basis should be achieved...|$|R
50|$|The {{remaining}} {{species of}} tortoise range in IUCN classification from extinct {{in the wild}} to vulnerable. Slow growth rate, late sexual maturity, and island endemism make the tortoises particularly prone to extinction without help from conservationists. The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> has become a flagship species for conservation efforts throughout the Galápagos.|$|E
50|$|The Galápagos {{tortoise}} complex or <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> complex (Chelonoidis nigra) are {{the largest}} living species of tortoise. Modern Galápagos tortoises can weigh up to 417 kg. Today, giant tortoises exist only on two remote archipelagos: the Galápagos 1000 km due west of mainland Ecuador, and Aldabra in the Indian Ocean, 700 km east of Tanzania.|$|E
50|$|Metro Richmond Zoo {{participates in}} several {{scientific}} research and wild life conservation projects. The zoo also plays a key part in addax and eastern bongo conservation. The bongo herd has had several calves born {{in the past several}} years and many of the addax born at the zoo have been released to the wild. Other threatened and endangered animals living here include Asian black bear, <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise,</b> and black-and-white ruffed lemur.|$|E
50|$|Between 1937 and 1951, Irving Johnson, skipper of the 96 ft {{brigantine}} Yankee Five, introduced five <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> to Pitcairn. Turpen, {{also known}} as Mr. Turpen or Mr. T, is the sole survivor. Turpen usually lives at Tedside by Western Harbour. A protection order makes it an offence should anyone kill, injure, capture, maim, or cause harm or distress to the tortoise.|$|R
50|$|The {{effort to}} {{conserve}} species to increase biodiversity {{is a very}} important aspect of life involving economic, social and cultural values with phylogenetic, biogeographic, ecological and demographic indulgence. <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> provide a great example of this as they represent the top mega-herbivores that aid in shaping Galapagos ecosystems. They provide critical ecosystem services by seed dispersing and by being ecological engineers through herbivory and nutrient cycling. Due to the extinction of many of these large herbivores, ecosystem functioning has diminished worldwide.|$|R

A great discrepancy in growth rates was observed after the ﬁrst year. When the animals were 4 years old, the carapace in the Zurich specimens was approximately twice as long as that in the CDRS tortoises, and the Zurich animals weighed approximately 10 times more than the CDRS animals. The zoo diet was modiﬁed by a reduction in nutrients and an increase in ﬁber to produce a more natural growth rate...|$|R
50|$|Yellow-footed {{tortoises}} {{are a large}} species - fifth-largest {{overall and}} third-largest mainland species, after the Aldabra giant tortoise (Aldabrachelys gigantea), <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Chelonoidis nigra), African spurred tortoise, and Asian forest tortoise. Typical sizes average 40 cm (15.75 in), but much larger specimens are common. The largest know specimen is a female that was 94 cm (37 in) long. They closely resemble the red-footed tortoise, and can sometimes be difficult to tell apart, especially as a preserved specimen, which led to {{quite a bit of}} confusion over the names and ranges.|$|E
50|$|The {{carapace}} is a {{brown or}} tan color with a high, domed shape. It has stocky, heavily scaled legs {{to support its}} heavy body. The neck of the Aldabra giant tortoise is very long, even for its great size, which helps the animal to exploit tree branches up to a meter from the ground as a food source. Similar in size to the famous <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise,</b> its carapace averages 122 cm in length with an average weight of 250 kg. Females are generally smaller than males, with average specimens measuring 91 cm in length and weighing 159 kg. Medium-sized specimens in captivity were reported as 70 to 110 kg in body mass. Another study found body masses of up to 132 kg most commonplace.|$|E
5000|$|The closest living {{relative}} (though not {{a direct}} ancestor) of the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> is the Chaco tortoise (Chelonoidis chilensis), {{a much smaller}} species from South America. The divergence between C. chilensis and C. nigra probably occurred 6-12 million years ago, an evolutionary event preceding the volcanic formation of the oldest modern Galápagos Islands 5 million years ago. Mitochondrial DNA analysis indicates that the oldest existing islands (Española and San Cristóbal) were colonised first, and that these populations seeded the younger islands via dispersal in a [...] "stepping stone" [...] fashion via local currents. Restricted gene flow between isolated islands then resulted in the independent evolution of the populations into the divergent forms observed in the modern species. The evolutionary relationships between the species thus echo the volcanic history of the islands.|$|E
50|$|<b>Giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> are {{characteristic}} reptiles {{that are currently}} found on two groups of tropical islands: the Aldabra Atoll in Seychelles and the Galapagos Islands in Ecuador (a population at the Mascarene Islands was exterminated by the 1900s). These tortoises can weigh as much as 417 kg and can grow to be 1.3 m long. <b>Giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> originally {{made their way to}} islands from the mainland; for example, Aldabra Atoll and Mascarenes <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> are related to Madagascar <b>tortoises</b> while <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> are related to Ecuador mainland tortoises. This phenomenon of excessive growth is known as island gigantism or insular gigantism. It occurs when the size of the animals that are isolated on an islands increases dramatically in comparison to their mainland relatives. This is due to several factors such as relaxed predation pressure, competitive release, or as an adaptation to increased environmental fluctuations on islands. However, <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> are no longer considered to have been examples of island gigantism, as they originally evolved their massive sizes on the mainland. <b>Giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> were once common across the Cenozoic faunas of Eurasia, Africa and the Americas.|$|R
40|$|Conservation discourses change rapidly both at {{global and}} local scales. To {{be able to}} capture these shifts and the {{relationships}} between humans and nature, we focused on a local and iconic conservation case: the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> (Chelonoidis spp.). We used the Q methodology to contextualize conservation for science and decision making and to explore the multidimensionality of the conservation concept in Galapagos. The results indicate four prevailing discourses: (1) Multi-actor governance; (2) <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> and ecosystems conservation; (3) community governance; and (4) market and tourism centred. These findings allow us to identify foreseeable points of disagreement, as well as areas of consensus, and to discuss the implication of the findings to address socio-ecological conservation and sustainability challenges. This can help the different involved stakeholders (managers, scientists and local communities) to the design and apply contextualized conservation actions and policies {{to contribute to a}} better sustainable management of the archipelago. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
25|$|Galápagos green turtles {{have been}} {{recorded}} and observed in the Galápagos {{as far back as}} the 17th century by William Dampier. Not much attention has been paid to them due to the overwhelming research done on the <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises.</b> Only over the last 30 years have extensive studies been performed covering the behaviors of the Galápagos green turtles. Much of the debate that has surrounded them recently is over the binomial classification of the species. It is the only subpopulation of green sea turtle to be given premise for separate species delineation, proposing Chelonia agassizii as a separate species. At this time, no distinctions have been made, mainly due to analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA of 15nesting beaches. This analysis has showed little distinction between the populations of the East Pacific waters and those of other nesting areas.|$|R
50|$|Large {{tortoises}} {{are among}} the longest-lived animals on the planet. Some individual Aldabra giant tortoises {{are thought to be}} over 200 years of age, but this is difficult to verify because they tend to outlive their human observers.

At his death in March 2006 at the Kolkata (formerly Calcutta) Zoo in India, Adwaita is reputed to have reached the longest ever measured life span of 255 years (birth year 1750). Today, Jonathan, a Seychelles giant tortoise, 184 years old, is thought to be the oldest living giant tortoise, and Esmeralda, 170 years old, the second oldest, since the death of Harriet at 176, a <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise.</b> Esmeralda is an Aldabra giant tortoise.|$|E
5000|$|After a short {{display at}} the museum, it was {{expected}} that Lonesome George would be returned to the Galápagos and will be displayed at the Charles Darwin Research Station on Santa Cruz Island for future generations to see. However, a dispute has broken out between an Ecuadorean ministry and the Galapagos Islands over where the preserved body of a <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> should be housed. The Ecuadorean government wants him to be shown in the capital, Quito, but the Galapagos local mayor says Lonesome George was a symbol of the islands and should return home. On February 17, 2017, Lonesome George flew back to the Galapagos Islands and is currently on display in an exhibit completely dedicated to him at the Charles Darwin Research Station. Most sources state Lonesome George was more than 100 years old, though others such as David Attenborough said he was probably in his eighties or possibly even younger. [...] Even one hundred is not especially old for a Galápagos tortoise.|$|E

40|$|The {{growth and}} weight {{development}} of Leopard tortoise hatchings (Geochelone pardalis) kept at the Al Wabra Wildlife Preservation (AWWP), Qatar, was observed {{for more than}} four years, and compared to data in literature for freeranging animals on body weight or carapace measurements. The results document a distinctively faster growth in the captive animals. Indications for the same phenomenon in other <b>tortoise</b> species (<b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises,</b> G. nigra; Spurthighed tortoises, Testudo graeca; Desert tortoises, Gopherus agassizi) were found in the literature. The cause of the high growth rate most likely is the constant provision with highly digestible food of low fiber content. Increased growth rates are suspected to have negative consequences such as obesity, high mortality, gastrointestinal illnesses, renal diseases, ‘‘pyramiding,’’ fibrous osteodystrophy or metabolic bone disease. The apparently widespread occurrence of high growth rates in intensively managed tortoises underlines how easily ectothermic animals can be oversupplemented with nutrients...|$|R
50|$|To restock {{their food}} {{supplies}} for the long journey, Essex sailed for Charles Island (later renamed Floreana Island) in the Galápagos Islands group. The crew needed to fix a serious leak and initially anchored off Hood Island (now known as Española Island) on 8 October. Over seven days they captured 300 <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> to supplement the ship's food stores. They then sailed for Charles Island, where on 22 October they took another 60 tortoises. The tortoises weighed from 100 lb to 800 lb each. The sailors captured them alive and allowed {{some of them to}} roam the ship at will; the rest they kept in the hold. The sailors believed the tortoises were capable of living for a year without eating or drinking water (though in fact the tortoises slowly starved). The sailors considered the tortoises delicious and extremely nutritious and would butcher them at sea as needed.|$|R

50|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> is now {{strictly}} {{protected and}} is listed on Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora. The listing requires that {{trade in the}} taxon and its products is subject to strict regulation by ratifying states, and international trade for primarily commercial purposes is prohibited. In 1936, the Ecuadorian government listed the giant tortoise as a protected species. In 1959, it declared all uninhabited areas in the Galápagos {{to be a national}} park and established the Charles Darwin Foundation. In 1970, capturing or removing many species from the islands (including tortoises and their eggs) was banned. To halt trade in the tortoises altogether, it became illegal to export the tortoises from Ecuador, captive or wild, continental, or insular in provenance. The banning of their exportation resulted in automatic prohibition of importation to the United States under Public Law 91-135 (1969). A 1971 Ecuadorian decree made it illegal to damage, remove, alter, or disturb any organism, rock, or other natural object in the National Park.|$|E
5000|$|The closest living {{relative}} of the <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> is the small Chaco tortoise from South America, {{although it is not}} a direct ancestor. Scientists believe the first tortoises arrived to Galapagos 2-3 million years ago by drifting 600 miles from the South American coast on vegetation rafts or on their own. They were already large animals before arriving in Galapagos. Colonizing the eastern-most islands of Española and San Cristóbal first, they then dispersed throughout the archipelago, eventually establishing about 16 separate populations on ten of the largest Galapagos Islands. Currently there are only 10 species of Galapagos Giant Tortoises left of the original 16 species. During the 16th and 17th centuries, the Galápagos were frequented by buccaneers preying on Spanish treasure ships. Filling a ship's hold with tortoises was an easy way to stock up on food, a tradition that was continued by whalers in the centuries that followed: [...] "whaling skippers were almost lyrical in their praise of tortoise meat, terming it far more delicious than chicken, pork or beef'. They said the meat of the giant tortoise was 'succulent meat and the oil from their bodies as pure as butter, but best of all, the giants could hibernate in a ship's damp for a year or more." ...|$|E

40|$|Volcanic islands {{represent}} excellent {{models with}} which to study the effect of vicariance on colonization and dispersal, particularly when the evolution of genetic diversity mirrors the sequence of geological {{events that led to}} island formation. Phylogeographic inference, however, can be particularly challenging for recent dispersal events within islands, where the antagonistic effects of land bridge formation and vicariance can affect movements of organisms with limited dispersal ability. We investigated levels of genetic divergence and recovered signatures of dispersal events for 631 <b>Galapagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> across the volcanoes of Sierra Negra and Cerro Azul on the island of Isabela. These volcanoes are among the most recent formations in the Galapagos (< 0. 7 million years), and previous studies based on genetic and morphological data could not recover a consistent pattern of lineage sorting. We integrated nested clade analysis of mitochondrial DNA control region sequences, to infer historical patterns of colonization, and a novel Bayesian multilocus genotyping method for recovering evidence of recent migration across volcanoes using eleven microsatellite loci.

40|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{an icon of}} the unique, endemic {{biodiversity}} of Galápagos, {{but little}} is known of its parasitic fauna. We assessed the diversity of parasitic nematode communities and their spatial distributions within four wild tortoise populations comprising three species across three Galápagos islands, and consider their implication for Galápagos tortoise conservation programmes. Coprological examinations revealed nematode eggs to be common, with more than 80 % of tortoises infected within each wild population. Faecal samples from tortoises within captive breeding centres on Santa Cruz, Isabela and San Cristobal islands also were examined. Five different nematode egg types were identified: oxyuroid, ascarid, trichurid and two types of strongyle. Sequencing of the 18 S small-subunit ribosomal RNA gene from adult nematodes passed with faeces identified novel sequences indicative of rhabditid and ascaridid species. In the wild, the composition of nematode com-munities varied according to tortoise species, which co-varied with island, but nematode diversity and abundance were reduced or altered in captive-reared animals.

40|$|The <b>Galápagos</b> <b>giant</b> <b>{{tortoises}},</b> Geochelone nigra, are {{the largest}} living tortoises {{and one of the}} two remaining species of <b>giant</b> <b>tortoises</b> in the world. Within the archipelago, only 1 l of the subspecies survive to the present. Most of the subspecies are endangered. The decline of the populations is primarily due to human impact. Buccaneers and whalers began in the 17 th century to remove tortoises from the islands and use them as a source of fresh meat. Introduced ani maIs such as feral goat, pigs, dogs, rats and continued poaching represent more threats to the surviving populations.
