5|$|In most Western music, tone {{clusters}} tend to {{be heard}} as dissonant. Clusters may be performed with almost any individual instrument on which three or more notes can be played simultaneously, {{as well as by}} most groups of instruments or voices. Keyboard instruments are particularly suited to the performance of tone clusters because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> easy to play multiple notes in unison on them.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{astronomy}} uses radiation {{outside the}} visible range with wavelengths greater than approximately one millimeter. Radio astronomy {{is different from}} most other forms of observational astronomy in that the observed radio waves can be treated as waves rather than as discrete photons. Hence, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> easier to measure both the amplitude and phase of radio waves, whereas this is not as easily done at shorter wavelengths.|$|E

5|$|Though {{virtually}} unseen in nature, high-purity bismuth {{can form}} distinctive, colorful hopper crystals. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> nontoxic {{and has a}} low melting point just above 271°C, so crystals may be grown using a household stove, although the resulting crystals will tend to be lower quality than lab-grown crystals.|$|E
5|$|Vega, also {{designated}} Alpha Lyrae (α Lyrae, abbreviated Alpha Lyr or α Lyr), is {{the brightest}} star in the constellation of Lyra, the fifth-brightest star in the night sky, and the second-brightest star in the northern celestial hemisphere, after Arcturus. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> close at only 25 light-years from the Sun, and, together with Arcturus and Sirius, one of the most luminous stars in the Sun's neighborhood.|$|E
5|$|According to modern-day analysis, a {{tropical}} depression {{developed in the}} Pacific Ocean, south of El Salvador, early on September 27. It drifted northward across Central America and eastern Mexico before emerging into the Gulf of Mexico near Ciudad del Carmen on September 30. Weather reports had indicated low air pressures over the area for several days. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> rare for {{a tropical}} cyclone to cross from the Pacific into the Atlantic, or vice versa, and this storm is among less than a dozen known to have officially done so. Only three other tropical cyclones have crossed from the eastern Pacific into the Gulf of Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Active-swimming predators, {{groups of}} leopard sharks often follow the tide onto {{intertidal}} mudflats to forage for food, mainly clams, spoon worms, crabs, shrimp, bony fish, and fish eggs. Most leopard sharks tend to remain {{within a particular}} area rather than undertaking long movements elsewhere, {{which has led to}} genetic divergence between populations of sharks living in different regions. This species is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the young hatch inside the uterus and are nourished by yolk. From March to June, the female gives birth to as many as 37 young after a gestation period of 10–12 months. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> slow-growing and takes many years to mature.|$|E
5|$|Boletus auripes has a disjunct distribution, {{and is one}} {{of several}} fungi found in both eastern Asia and eastern North America. In North America, where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> common, the range of the fungus extends from Alaska south to Mexico, and east to New York. In Central America, it has been {{recorded}} in Belize. The mushroom has also been recorded from Taiwan, China (including Yunnan, Sichuan, Guangdong, Kwangsi, and Hunan), and Japan. It was reported for the first time from the Russian Far East in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to lack of}} {{surviving}} documentation, {{it is difficult to}} attribute unsigned works from the period with any degree of certainty. The origin of the Crucifix has often been contested, but is generally thought to be by Cimabue based on stylistic traits and mentions by both Vasari and Nicolò Albertini. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> primitive compared to his 1290s works and is thus believed to date from his early period. According to Vasari, the crucifix's success led to the commissions at Pisa, Tuscany that established his reputation.|$|E

5|$|For many years, the Moon {{has been}} {{recognized}} as an excellent site for telescopes. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> nearby; astronomical seeing is not a concern; certain craters near the poles are permanently dark and cold, and thus especially useful for infrared telescopes; and radio telescopes {{on the far side}} would be shielded from the radio chatter of Earth. The lunar soil, although it poses a problem for any moving parts of telescopes, can be mixed with carbon nanotubes and epoxies and employed in the construction of mirrors up to 50 meters in diameter. A lunar zenith telescope can be made cheaply with ionic liquid.|$|E
5|$|In North America, it {{is known}} from eastern Canada, south to Florida and west to Minnesota in the United States, and into Mexico and Central America. Its European {{distribution}} is widespread; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> common in many regions, but rare or almost absent in others. In Asia, it has been recorded from the vicinity of Dashkin in the Astore District of northern Pakistan, and as far east as China, {{where it has been}} recorded from Hebei, Jiangsu, Fujian, Guangdong and Sichuan provinces, and Korea.|$|E
5|$|Inocybe saliceticola {{has been}} {{recorded}} in several locations around Finland, ranging from the hemiboreal zones {{in the east and}} the south of the country, to boreal areas in the north, and it has also been found in Sweden, close to the Klarälven. At least in North Karelia, Finland, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> common in the right habitats. It is one of over 150 species of Inocybe found in the Nordic countries, and fruit bodies can be encountered between late July and early October.|$|E
50|$|Heterosexual {{prostitution}} was legalised in Egypt in 1882 by the British occupying administration. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> {{more widely}} seen between approximately 1929 to 1958, {{a time of}} British occupation.|$|R
50|$|In 2012, {{the event}} took place from 24 to 25 October. About 40,000 people attended, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> trouble-free, with only 23 arrests, {{less than the}} {{previous}} year.|$|R
50|$|Perennial Divide was a British {{electronic}} music band, formed in 1986 by Jack Dangers, Johnny Stephens and Paul Freeguard. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>relatively</b> short-lived; Dangers and Stephens {{left it in}} 1988 to form Meat Beat Manifesto.|$|R
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> {{difficult}} to separate ytterbium from other lanthanides due to its similar properties. As a result, the process is somewhat long. First, minerals such as monazite or xenotime are dissolved into various acids, such as sulfuric acid. Ytterbium can then be separated from other lanthanides by ion exchange, as can other lanthanides. The solution is then applied to a resin, which different lanthanides bind in different matters. This is then dissolved using complexing agents, and due to {{the different types of}} bonding exhibited by the different lanthanides, it is possible to isolate the compounds.|$|E
5|$|Lactifluus piperatus in {{the wide}} sense, i.e. {{including}} probably several species, is found in Europe, the Black sea region in northeastern Turkey, and eastern and central North America east of Minnesota. It has been accidentally introduced into Australasia, where it is found under introduced and native trees. It is found {{on the floor in}} deciduous woodland, particularly under beech (Betula), and can be found throughout summer and autumn and into early winter. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> common, though not as common as the similar species L. vellereus. L. piperatus is found solitarily or in scattered groups. It is sometimes found growing together with Russula cyanoxantha.|$|E
5|$|Np2O5 is black-brown {{in color}} and monoclinic with a lattice size of 418×658×409picometres. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>relatively</b> {{unstable}} and decomposes to NpO2 and O2 at 420-695°C. Although Np2O5 was initially subject to several studies that claimed to produce it with mutually contradictory methods, it was eventually prepared successfully by heating neptunium peroxide to 300-350°C for 2–3 hours or by heating it under a layer of water in an ampoule at 180°C.|$|E
