5|$|As {{winners of}} the Champions League, Manchester United earned places in the 2008 UEFA Super Cup against 2008 UEFA Cup Final winners Zenit Saint Petersburg and the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup in Japan. The Super Cup was played at Stade Louis II in Monaco in August 2008, with Zenit winning 2–1. As UEFA's {{representative}} at the Club World Cup, Manchester United entered the competition in the semi-finals, where they beat 2008 AFC Champions League winners <b>Gamba</b> Osaka 5–3, before beating 2008 Copa Libertadores winners LDU Quito 1–0 in the final.|$|E
50|$|Several {{programs}} and {{many forms of}} example code have been written using and for <b>Gambas.</b> , Freecode (formerly Freshmeat) listed 23 applications that were developed using <b>Gambas,</b> while the <b>Gambas</b> wiki listed 70; several other specialized sites list <b>Gambas</b> applications and code. There is even a <b>Gambas</b> written application, named Gambas3 ShowCase, {{that acts as a}} software center to download or install <b>Gambas</b> 3 applications. Several community sites, including community forums and mailing lists, also exist for <b>Gambas.</b> <b>Gambas</b> Guru offers project hosting, program listing, forums and more for <b>Gambas</b> users.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gambas</b> is {{designed}} to build graphical programs using the Qt (currently Qt 4.x or 5.x) or the GTK+ toolkit (GTK 3.x also supported as of 3.6.0); the <b>Gambas</b> IDE is written in <b>Gambas.</b> <b>Gambas</b> includes a GUI designer to aid in creating user interfaces, but can also make command line applications. The <b>Gambas</b> runtime environment is needed to run executables.|$|R
50|$|The {{next major}} {{iteration}} of <b>Gambas,</b> the 3.x versions, {{was released on}} December 31, 2011. Early benchmarks of the <b>Gambas</b> 3 development versions showed its <b>Gambas</b> scripting being significantly faster than Perl and Python equivalents.|$|R
5|$|Several musical {{instruments}} have been found, including a trumpet, three violins and a viola da <b>gamba,</b> all expensive objects that probably belonged {{to either the}} officers or the trumpeters. One of the trumpeters on board {{was a member of}} the admiral's musical ensemble and it is assumed that one of the particularly fine, German-made instruments belonged to him. Another remnant of the officers' personal stores was discovered in 1997, consisting of a woven basket filled with tobacco and expensive imported foodstuffs and spices, including ginger, plums, grapes and cinnamon quills.|$|E
5|$|The cantata is {{structured}} {{in two parts}} of seven movements each, to be performed {{before and after the}} sermon. It is scored for four vocal soloists (soprano (S), alto (A), tenor (T) and bass (B)), a four-part choir SATB, trumpet (Tr), two oboes (Ob), oboe d'amore (Oa), two violins (Vl), viola (Va), viola da <b>gamba</b> (Vg) and basso continuo (Bc). The two parts of seven movements each are composed as the same arrangement of alternating recitatives and arias with a concluding chorale, only Part II is opened by a sinfonia instead of a chorus. The duration is given as 35 minutes.|$|E
5|$|The work is scored for vocal soloists (soprano, alto, tenor and bass), a four-part choir SATB, and an {{orchestra}} of two flauto traverso (Ft), two oboes (Ob), two oboes da caccia (Oc), two oboes d'amore (Oa), two violins, viola (Va), and basso continuo. Bach added some instruments which were already old-fashioned {{at the time}} in arias for special effects, such as the archlute, the viola d'amore and the viola da <b>gamba</b> (Vg). Bach did not differentiate the vox Christi (voice of Christ), singing the words of Jesus, from the other bass recitatives and arias, nor the evangelist from the tenor arias.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gambas</b> is {{the name}} of an {{object-oriented}} dialect of the BASIC programming language, as well as the integrated development environment that accompanies it. Designed to run on Linux and other Unix-like computer operating systems, its name is a recursive acronym for <b>Gambas</b> Almost Means Basic. <b>Gambas</b> is also the word for prawns in the Spanish and Portuguese languages, from which the projects logos are derived.|$|R
50|$|The {{first of}} the 2.x {{versions}} was released on January 2, 2008 after {{three to four years}} of development. It featured a major redesign of the interface, now with all forms and functions embedded in a single window, as well as some changes to the <b>Gambas</b> syntax, although for the most part code compatibility was kept. It featured major updates to existing <b>Gambas</b> components as well as the addition of some new ones, such as new components that could use GTK+ or SDL for drawing or utilize OpenGL acceleration. <b>Gambas</b> 2.x versions can load up and run <b>Gambas</b> 1.x projects, with occasional incompatibilities.|$|R
50|$|<b>Gambas</b> is {{included}} in the repositories of a number of Linux distributions, such as Debian, Fedora, Mandriva Linux and Ubuntu. A Microsoft Windows version of <b>Gambas</b> was run under the Cygwin environment, although this version was significantly less tested than its Linux counterparts and was command-line only; Cooperative Linux and derivatives have also been used, as well as specialized Linux virtual machines. An independent contributor, François Gallo, also worked on porting <b>Gambas</b> 3.x to Mac OS X and FreeBSD, based on using local versions of the X11 system. <b>Gambas</b> from version 3.2 can run on Raspberry Pi, but offers no just-in-time compilation there.|$|R
5|$|For {{the purpose}} of {{analysis}} the music scholar Jane Glover has divided Monteverdi's list of instruments into three main groups: strings, brass and continuo, with a few further items not easily classifiable. The strings grouping is formed from ten members of the violin family (viole da brazzo), two double basses (contrabassi de viola), and two small violins (violini piccoli alla francese). The viole da brazzo are in two five-part ensembles, each comprising two violins, two violas and a cello. The brass group contains four or five trombones (sackbuts), three trumpets and two cornetts. The continuo forces include two harpsichords (duoi gravicembani), a double harp (arpa doppia), two or three chitarroni, two pipe organs (organi di legno), three bass viola da <b>gamba,</b> and a regal or small reed organ. Outside of these groupings are two recorders (flautini alla vigesima secunda), and possibly one or more citterns—unlisted by Monteverdi, but included in instructions relating {{to the end of}} act 4.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{source for}} the composition is a copied manuscript dated 1768, therefore {{the date of the}} composition is not certain. Research leads to a funeral of a former mayor of Mühlhausen on 16 September 1708. The text is a carefully compiled juxtaposition of biblical texts, three quotations from the Old Testament and four from the New Testament, combined with funeral hymns, of which two are sung and one is quoted instrumentally, and some additions by an anonymous author. Bach scored the work for four vocal parts and a small ensemble of Baroque instruments, two recorders, two violas da <b>gamba</b> and continuo. The work is opened by an instrumental Sonatina, followed by through-composed sections which have been assigned to three movements. The structure is symmetrical around a turning point, when the lower voices, who contemplate the Old Covenant, are overcome by a soprano calling for Jesus.|$|E
5|$|The total {{population}} {{size of the}} African river martin is unknown. In the late 1980s, {{it appeared to be}} common, if local, and large numbers were seen on migration in Gabon. However, it is particularly poorly known in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and it is unclear if there is any relationship between the birds breeding in the DRC and those breeding in coastal areas of Gabon and the Republic of Congo. A flock of 15,000 birds was seen in 1997, and a mixed flock with rosy bee-eater Merops malimbicus was estimated at 100,000 birds; nevertheless, {{due to the lack of}} detailed information, the species is classed by the IUCN as Data Deficient. In the 1950s, the species was caught and eaten in large quantities in the DRC by the local population, and this practice could be increasing. Breeding colonies in river sandbars are also liable to flooding, but thousands of birds were breeding on the grasslands east of <b>Gamba</b> as recently as 2005.|$|E
5000|$|Its {{object model}} and each class being {{represented}} in a file, the archiver to package {{the program is}} inspired by the Java programming language. <b>Gambas</b> {{is intended to be}} an alternative for former Visual Basic developers who have decided to migrate to Linux. There are also other important distinctions between the <b>Gambas</b> and Visual Basic. One notable example is that in <b>Gambas</b> array indexes always start with 0, whereas Visual Basic indexes can start with 0 or 1. <b>Gambas</b> also supports the += and -= shorthand not found in classic Visual Basic. Both of these are features of Visual Basic [...]NET however.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Gambas</b> is a Visual Basic {{inspired}} {{free software}} programming language for the Linux operating system. It {{is not a}} clone of Visual Basic, {{but it does have}} the ability to convert Visual Basic programs to <b>Gambas.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>Gambas</b> is {{intended}} to provide a similar experience as developing in Microsoft Visual Basic, {{but it is not}} a free software clone of the popular proprietary program. The author of <b>Gambas</b> makes it clear that there are similarities to Visual Basic, such as syntax for BASIC programs and the integrated development environment; <b>Gambas</b> was written from the start to be a development environment of its own and seeks to improve on the formula.|$|R

25|$|An early {{highlight}} for {{the season}} was Adelaide's run to {{the final of the}} AFC Champions League against <b>Gamba</b> Osaka. <b>Gamba</b> Osaka entered the FIFA Club World Cup as the winner of the AFC Champion's League, freeing up the tournament's Japanese host position; Adelaide United, as runners-up of the AFC Champion's League, filled this position. Their first match was a play-off against 2007–08 OFC Champions League champions Waitakere United from New Zealand. The Reds defeated Waitakere 2–1 via two set plays from Paul Reid to secure a rematch with ACL rivals <b>Gamba</b> Osaka on 14 December– the third meeting between the two sides in three weeks. The Reds fought valiantly and created many opportunities, in particular Travis Dodd, but lost 0–1 after a 23rd minute shot by <b>Gamba</b> midfielder, Yasuhito Endō. On 18 December, Adelaide played in the fifth-place play-off match against Egyptian club Al Ahly SC, defeating them 1–0 to be rewarded the fifth-place prize of US$1.5 million. Adelaide United were awarded the Fair Play award upon the completion of the tournament, and Cristiano's goal in the fifth-place play-off was selected as goal of the tournament.|$|E
