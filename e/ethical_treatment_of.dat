40|$|Over {{the last}} few decades, {{advertisements}} have objectified and sexualized women as a tactic to attract men into supporting causes and buying products. This research project focuses on the advertisements published by the animal rights group, PETA, People for the <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatments</b> <b>of</b> Animals, and its deliberate use of degrading images of women to support its cause. PETA advertisements juxtapose barely clad women with animals or animal references, making the viewer see women as animalistic, out of control, {{and in need of}} taming or saving. Research shows that the results of such negative advertising tactics are correlated with increased aggression in male viewers, as well as increased acceptance of rape attitudes among men. Sexualized and objectified images take away from the purpose of the animal rights movement, making the audience reluctant to support the cause. Furthermore, these advertisements seriously jeopardize and undermine the women 2 ̆ 7 s fight for equality in our culture. [URL]...|$|R
40|$|My {{purpose in}} this essay is to suggest, via case study, that if Anglo-American {{philosophy}} is to become more inclusive of non-western traditions, the discipline requires far greater efforts at self-scrutiny. I begin with the premise that Confucian <b>ethical</b> <b>treatments</b> <b>of</b> manners afford unique and distinctive arguments from which moral philosophy might profit, then seek to show why receptivity to these arguments will be low. I examine how ordinary good manners have largely fallen out of philosophical moral discourse in the west, looking specifically at three areas: conditions in the 18 th and 19 th centuries that depressed philosophical attention to manners; discourse conventions in contemporary philosophy that privilege modes of analysis not well fitted to close scrutiny of manners; and a philosophical culture that implicitly encourages indifference or even antipathy toward polite conduct. I argue that these three areas function in effect to render contemporary discourse inhospitable to greater inclusivity where Confucianism is concerned and thus, more broadly, that greater self-scrutiny regarding unexamined, parochial western commitments and practices is necessary for genuine inclusivity...|$|R

Dix advocated the expansion of state psychiatric hospitals for patients who were at the time being housed in jails and poor houses. Despite her good intentions, rapid urbanization and increased immigration led to a gross overwhelming of the state's mental health systems and because of this, as the 19th century ended and the 20th century began, a shift in focus from treatment to custodial care was seen. As quality of care declined and psychotropic drugs were introduced, those with mental illnesses were reintroduced to the community, where community mental health services were designated as primary care providers.|$|R

40|$|An {{outgrowth}} <b>of</b> {{demands for}} <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> and repatriation <b>of</b> their ancestral remains, Indigenous Archaeology (IA) reflects {{the desire of}} Indigenous peoples to {{have a say in}} how stories of their pasts get told. Too often, Indigenous people claim, archaeologists have discounted oral tradition in favor of scientifically derived histories, histories that may discount or contradict millennia-old beliefs. IA is different, done for them, sometimes by them, and usually in complete collaboration with them. Their questions are central to research agendas and interpretations. IA is controversial because some archaeologists see collaboration as infringement on academic freedom, as movement away from a hardearned, explicitly scientific archaeology, and as essentializing Indigenous people. Nevertheless, IA has rapidly expanded internationally {{as part of an effort}} to decolonize archaeology. Many more Indigenous people have become trained as archaeologists, and those who practice IA have carefully pondered the many epistemological issues it raises.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lasers {{have been}} used in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> port-wine stains (PWS) for more than 30 years. With the {{introduction}} of the flash-lamp pulsed-dye laser (FPDL) it was assumed that infants could be treated safely, effectively, and probably more efficiently. Nowadays, FPDL treatment is an established form <b>of</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> PWS in childhood. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: On the basis of the iterative Health Care Technology Assessment (HCTA) loop, we examined whether sufficient evidence from evaluations has been present to support the introduction <b>of</b> FPDL <b>treatment</b> for facial PWS at an early age. Such an assessment requires an interdisciplinary approach focusing on aspects of safety, efficacy, effectiveness, quality of life, costs, and the <b>ethical</b> issues <b>of</b> <b>treatment.</b> RESULTS: Assessment <b>of</b> the FPDL in PWS <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> children did not follow the model of medical innovation and evaluation. Most assessments have been focused on laser applications that were already in clinical use. Efficacy and effectiveness <b>of</b> laser <b>treatment</b> have been the major concern in most assessments. Only a few studies have looked at costs and ethical aspects of treating children. CONCLUSIONS: The introduction and diffusion of the use of the FPDL in the <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> PWS in childhood were uncontrolled, and the field was not prepared to use this technique properly. We believe that this nonadherence to the iterative HCTA model reflects the gradual way by which innovations find their way into clinical practic...|$|R
30|$|Experimental animal {{models have}} been created and refined for over 80  years to {{investigate}} the development, management, and <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> sepsis [1], and have contributed to many important advances {{in our understanding of}} sepsis pathophysiology [2]. Recognizing the ethical implications of using animals in research, the “ 3 Rs”—Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction—form the guiding principles for ethical standards when conducting animal research [3]. These guidelines exclude death as an endpoint, and suggest the use of surrogate markers of death to establish humane endpoints where possible. Surrogate markers of death involve using criteria related to pain, suffering, and/or illness, such as clinically relevant scoring systems that semi-quantitatively assess the physical appearance and/or behavior of an animal [4 – 6], in order to gauge the time at which animals should be humanely euthanized [7]. These decisions must be carefully balanced with minimizing premature termination of animal studies, which may lead to incomplete observations and may necessitate use of even more animals [7, 8]. Improvements are necessary to achieve more <b>ethical</b> and humane <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> animals in research related to critical care medicine [7, 9, 10], and specifically for experimental sepsis research [10], where clear endpoint markers have not been established for the gold standard sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).|$|R
