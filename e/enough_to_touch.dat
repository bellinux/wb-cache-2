25|$|A petting zoo, {{also called}} petting farms or children's zoos, {{features}} {{a combination of}} domestic animals and wild species that are docile <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> and feed.

25|$|The Stillness is {{constantly}} wracked by geological cataclysms, and every few hundred years, an event is severe <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> off a global volcanic winter, {{referred to as}} a Fifth Season. Some characters, referred to as orogenes, have the ability to manipulate geological energies on a large scale, as well as magic itself on a smaller scale. They are a persecuted and feared minority, though it is largely due to their efforts humanity has survived the Seasons at all.|$|E

5000|$|Personal Space: (18 inches - 4 feet) - Reserved for {{conversations with}} friends, {{extended}} family, associates, and group discussions.

25|$|The fuel {{channels}} {{can only}} maintain criticality {{if they are}} mechanically sound. If {{the temperature of the}} fuel bundles increases {{to the point where they}} are mechanically unstable, their horizontal layout means they will bend under gravity, shifting the layout of the bundles and reducing the efficiency of the reactions. Because the original fuel arrangement is optimum for a chain reaction and the natural uranium fuel has little excess reactivity, any significant deformation will stop the inter-fuel pellet fission reaction. This will not stop heat production from fission product decay, which would continue to supply a considerable heat output. If this process further weakens the fuel bundles, they will eventually bend far <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the calandria tube, allowing heat to be efficiently transferred into the moderator tank. The moderator vessel has a considerable thermal capability on its own, and is normally kept relatively cool.|$|E
2500|$|In 1997, BBC Radio 4 {{broadcast}} a radio play about the Thetis disaster. The play was called Close <b>Enough</b> <b>To</b> <b>Touch</b> and {{was written by}} Liverpool writer Fred Lawless. The play was also broadcast on BBC Radio Merseyside and the BBC World Service. In 1999, a play entitled HMS Thetis by Mark Gee in association with David Roberts, was performed at the Liverpool Bluecoat Chambers and at Birkenheads Pacific Road Theatre. The play starred John McArdle and also the newly employed First Year Apprentices from Cammell Laird Shipyard, (Paul Gillies, Dave Gill, Alan Lane, Chris Motley, Mike Jebb, Steve Taylor, Ollie Dodson, Stuie Dicken, Mark Poland, Ben McDonald, Tony Cummins, Barry Hayes, Chris Hall, Martin King, Graham Crilly, Billy Coburn, Matty Brassey,) ...|$|E

25|$|The {{recruits}} {{are given}} the opportunity to phone their next of kin and inform them of the recruit's safe arrival, then are searched for contraband. They are issued utility and physical training uniforms and toiletries. From here, the males receive their first military haircut, where they are left essentially bald.

40|$|Atypical two-tine {{tuning fork}} is barely audible when held {{vibrating}} at an arm's length. It is <b>enough,</b> however, <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> its base <b>to</b> a table or, better, to a resonance {{box and the}} emitted sound becomes much louder. An inquiring student may pose questions: Why is a bare tuning fork such a weak emitter of sound?; What {{is the role of}} the resonance box?; Where does energy connected with larger intensity of emitted acoustic waves come from...|$|R
60|$|As I leaned my {{face against}} the bed, his feeble hand could just move itself <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> me. I hope the touch was penitent. It tried to hold my dress and keep hold, but the fingers were too weak to close.|$|E

"Nay," [...] said Jephthah, who, to do him justice, had {{respected}} {{the rights of}} hospitality <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> his weapon even when he thought her Irish, [...] "we harm not women and babes save when they are even as the Amalekites. Let my brother go, child. I touch thee not, though thou be of an ungodly seed; and I counsel thee, Steadfast, touch not the accursed thing, but rid thyself thereof, ere thou be defiled." ...|$|R
50|$|The two sheaths {{pictured in}} the {{photographs}} accompanying this article are both incorrect {{and should not be}} used as references. There is also no evidence for sheaths being suspended from straps, as shown in the two pictures. Contemporary depictions show sheaths attached directly to military belts, with the upper suspension rings in line with the belt and attached very closely to the buttons of the 'frog plates' worn on the belt, often closely <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> be <b>touching.</b>|$|R

60|$|Then he {{came back}} and passing close <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> Foster, went up the steps and through a door. Foster put down the lamp and strolled out of the garage.

He left the door open and by and by heard a man enter the hall and stop at the counter.|$|E

50|$|Bernkastel {{is invited}} to a Tea Party by Lambdadelta and Featherine. Bernkastels journey to the Tea Party {{involves}} avoiding the traps set by Lambda and Featherine in order to not become a laughingstock.

Lambdadelta believes that Bernkastel will be cautious <b>enough</b> not <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> her traps and will arrive, even stating it as the Witch of Certainty, while Featherine replies that Bernkastel will definitely fall for their trap.|$|R

60|$|Alpenstocks.--What we {{have said}} about {{the handle of the}} axe applies in all respects to the Alpenstock, except that the length of the latter should be different, and that the leathern ring would of course not be required.

50|$|Either {{one player}} against the {{computer}} or two human players manage a pushcart full of hexagonal tiles. Tiles {{fall out of}} your basket and slide down the board of other tiles to match up {{with the end of}} your structure in a honeycomb fashion.

The goal is to keep your board fairly clear while hoping that your opponent makes <b>enough</b> mistakes <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the bottom and lose.|$|R
60|$|By this time, {{not more}} than fifty out of the hundred and forty-six who entered the cell were alive. Suddenly a scream of joy, from those near the window, proclaimed that a native was {{approaching}} with some water. The struggle at the window was fiercer than ever. The bowl was too wide {{to pass through the}} bars, and the water was being spilt in vain; each man who strove to get his face far <b>enough</b> through <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> the bowl being torn back, by his eager comrades behind.|$|R
50|$|Trainees {{will undergo}} a {{urinalysis}} test {{the day after}} arrival. Any trainee that fails the drug test will immediately {{be separated from the}} military.

60|$|At {{the foot}} of that beech I found Manytongues, and the deep obscurity in which his form was embedded, was, of itself, a high {{recommendation}} of the position. I did not see him until almost near <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> him. He was seated on a bench, and seemed entirely at his ease, like one accustomed to ambushes, vigilance, and midnight assaults. We exchanged reports, ascertained all was well, and then I took my seat at the interpreter's side, willing to beguile the time by such discourse as occurred to my mind.|$|E
60|$|Only {{one of the}} {{audience}} was sceptical. Being himself a master of deception, Ujarak suspected some trick, and slowly approached the giant bear {{with the intention of}} testing its reality--in some trepidation, however, for he was naturally superstitious. When he had drawn near <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> <b>touch</b> it, he received a tremendous blow on the forehead, which laid him flat on his back in a partially stunned condition, with his head in Pussimek's lap. That amiable woman considerately allowed it to remain there, and as the wizard felt mentally confused he did not care to change his position.|$|E
50|$|For Armor, Hannibal's Bronze Musculata {{was tested}} against Genghis Khan's Steel Lamellar in {{protecting}} against the opposing warrior's sword. Both Hannibal and Genghis Khan's shields held well, with the arm behind it not encountering <b>enough</b> force <b>to</b> break bone. Both the Musculata and the Lamellar sustained harmless penetration, not <b>enough</b> <b>to</b> even <b>touch</b> the wearer. But Hannibal's brass helmet dented and failed at , which meant a depressed skull fracture, while Genghis Khan's helmet {{was not only}} unscathed, but there was not <b>enough</b> force <b>to</b> damage the skull. The edge was given to Genghis Khan due {{to the failure of}} Hannibal's helmet and since Genghis Khan's armor was made of a stronger material.|$|R
