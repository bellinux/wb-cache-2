5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy.</b> While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic pile, and its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy.</b> The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|By the 38th lap, {{drivers who}} made their stops during the safety car period entered into their <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> {{conservation}} phase. Andretti chose {{to allow their}} drivers {{to remain on the}} circuit {{for as long as possible}} and their strategy allowed Félix da Costa and Frijns to catch and overtake d'Ambrosio and Turvey for the fifth and sixth positions in the event's closing period. Félix da Costa then attempted to catch the fourth-placed Prost but was unable to get close to him. As the field began the final lap, di Grassi, Heidfeld and Prost had five percent of usage <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> remaining and Buemi was unchallenged for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. Di Grassi finished second, ahead of Heidfeld in third. Prost was fourth and Félix da Costa fifth. Frijns, d'Ambrosio, Turvey, Engel and Sarrazin rounded out the top ten points-scoring positions. Piquet, Carroll filled the next two positions. Bird was fast enough to unlap himself by passing the race leaders, despite spinning his tyres at the circuit's low-speed exit turns, and finished in 13th. Duval and Rosenqvist were the last of the classified finishers. It was Buemi's first victory of the season and the seventh of his career. There were three lead changes in the race; four drivers reached the front of the field. Buemi led once for a total of 20 laps, more than any other competitor. Of the two other retirements, Vergne stopped with an overheating battery, and Abt lost all <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> in his car after 34 laps.|$|E

5|$|As the {{efficiency}} {{is proportional to}} Fs3, small improvements in low frequency extension with the same driver and box volume will result in very significant reductions in efficiency. For these reasons, subwoofers are typically very inefficient at converting <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> into sound energy. This combination of factors accounts for the higher amplifier power required to drive subwoofers, and the requirement for greater power handling for subwoofer drivers. Enclosure variations (e.g., bass reflex designs with a port in the cabinet) are often used for subwoofers to increase {{the efficiency}} of the driver/enclosure system, helping to reduce the amplifier power requirements.|$|E
5|$|Gas {{tungsten}} {{arc welding}} (GTAW), {{also known as}} tungsten inert gas (TIG) welding, is an arc welding process that uses a non-consumable tungsten electrode to produce the weld.

A constant-current welding power supply produces <b>electrical</b> <b>energy,</b> which is conducted across the arc through a column of highly ionized gas and metal vapors known as a plasma.|$|E

5|$|On lap 20 it was {{announced}} that Vergne was under investigation by the stewards after he was observed speeding in the pit lane. He was issued with a drive-through penalty three laps later, ending his chances of battling for the victory. He remerged in fifth place ahead of both Audi Sport ABT cars but behind Prost, and Buemi inherited second place. Duval stopped on the track with powertrain problems on the 25th lap but was able to restart his car and continued in 18th position. Having made a pit stop one lap earlier {{than the rest of the}} field, Rosenqvist conserved <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> usage, allowing Buemi to close up to him at a rate of nearly two seconds per lap because he used Fan Boost, had more <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> available to him, and the requirement to lift and coast was minimal. Abt lost sixth place when was overtaken by teammate di Grassi at the sixth turn on lap 27. Shortly afterwards, Buemi drafted Rosenqvist, braked later than he did, and overtook him around the outside at turn eleven to take over the lead. López passed Frijns to move into tenth place. Vergne attempted to move ahead of Prost but was unable to pass, allowing di Grassi to close up to Vergne. Vergne defended his position, but di Grassi overtook him at turn seven to take over fifth place.|$|E
5|$|Since <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> cannot {{easily be}} stored in {{quantities}} large enough to meet demands on a national scale, at all times exactly as much must be produced as is required.

5|$|Experimentation by Faraday in 1831 {{revealed}} that a wire moving perpendicular to a magnetic field developed a potential difference between its ends.

Exploitation of this discovery enabled him to invent the first electrical generator in 1831, in which he converted the mechanical energy of a rotating copper disc to <b>electrical</b> <b>energy.</b> Faraday's disc was inefficient and of no use as a practical generator, but it showed the possibility of generating electric power using magnetism, a possibility that would be taken up by those that followed on from his work.|$|E
5|$|Oliver Turvey won {{the pole}} {{position}} after Daniel Abt was penalised for a tyre pressure infringement and maintained his advantage {{on the first}} lap. He came under pressure from José María López until {{he retired from the}} ePrix with power issues, handing the lead to López. Di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio made early pit stops for the switch into their second cars and di Grassi became the leader on lap 26 {{when the rest of the}} field made their stops. D'Ambrosio held off pressure from Vergne for second place until he was passed on the 43rd lap and di Grassi remained the leader for the rest of the race after conserving <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> to win.

It came after Rosenqvist was sent airborne following contact with Evans's rear wheel. Despite his vehicle's back-end sustaining damage, Evans told his team over the radio that he could continue, but Rosenqvist was forced to retire. Prost however was delayed long enough to allow Evans move ahead of him for fifth place. Heidfeld was unhurt and was able to rejoin the race. On lap 44, D'Ambrosio lost third position to Bird who passed him around the outside at turn three. D'Ambrosio then ran out of <b>electrical</b> <b>energy,</b> allowing Gutiérrez into tenth. Di Grassi conserved his <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> usage and crossed the start/finish line after 45 laps to win the race. Vergne finished second, 1.966 seconds behind with Bird in third, Evans fourth and Prost fifth. López recovered from his lap 35 spin to secure sixth place, and Abt took seventh. Carroll, Piquet and Gutiérrez completed the top-ten points-scoring positions. Frijns, Heidfeld, Buemi and d'Ambrosio filled the next four positions with Sarrazin and Rosenqvist the last of the classified finishers. It was di Grassi's first victory of the season and the fifth of his career. Di Grassi's win ended e.Dams-Renault's streak of six consecutive victories, extending back to the 2016 Berlin ePrix.

5|$|The {{capacitor}} is {{a development}} of the Leyden jar and is a device that can store charge, and thereby storing <b>electrical</b> <b>energy</b> in the resulting field. It consists of two conducting plates separated by a thin insulating dielectric layer; in practice, thin metal foils are coiled together, increasing the surface area per unit volume and therefore the capacitance. The unit of capacitance is the farad, named after Michael Faraday, and given the symbol F: one farad is the capacitance that develops a potential difference of one volt when it stores a charge of one coulomb. A capacitor connected to a voltage supply initially causes a current as it accumulates charge; this current will however decay in time as the capacitor fills, eventually falling to zero. A capacitor will therefore not permit a steady state current, but instead blocks it.|$|E
