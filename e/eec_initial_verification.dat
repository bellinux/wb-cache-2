40|$|In {{the present}} study, we aimed to {{discover}} cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) proteins with significant abundance difference between early multiple sclerosis patients and controls, and do an <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> of these proteins using selected reaction monitoring (SRM). iTRAQ and Orbitrap MS {{were used to}} compare the CSF proteome of patients with clinically isolated syndrome (CIS) (n = 5), patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis that had CIS at the time of lumbar puncture (n = 5), and controls with other inflammatory neurological disease (n = 5). Of more than 1200 identified proteins, five proteins were identified with significant abundance difference between the patients and controls. In the <b>initial</b> <b>verification</b> using SRM we analyzed a larger patient and control cohort (n = 132) and also included proteins reported as differentially abundant in multiple sclerosis in the literature. We found significant abundance difference for 11 proteins after verification, of which the five proteins alpha- 1 -antichymotrypsin, contactin- 1, apolipoprotein D, clusterin, and kallikrein- 6 were significantly differentially abundant in several of the group comparisons.

Case Report A term male neonate presented at birth with classic bladder exstrophy, a variant of the exstrophy-epispadias complex (EEC). The defect was covered with sterile silicon gauzes and waterproof dressing; at 72 hours of life, primary closure without osteotomy of bladder, pelvis, and abdominal wall was successfully performed. Discussion EEC incidence is approximately 2. 15 per 1, 00, 000 live births; several urological, musculocutaneous, spinal, orthopedic, gastrointestinal, and gynecological anomalies may be associated to <b>EEC.</b> <b>Initial</b> medical management includes use of occlusive dressings to prevent air contact and dehydration of the open bladder template.

Surgical repair stages include initial closure of the bladder and abdominal wall with or without osteotomy, followed by epispadias repair at 6 to 12 months, and bladder neck repair around 5 years of life. Those who fail to attain continence eventually undergo bladder augmentation and placement of a catheterizable conduit.
