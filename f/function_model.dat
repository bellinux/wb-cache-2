40|$|Belief {{functions}} are a versatile class of mathematical models which include as cases both {{first order logic}} and probability statements. Although belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> have a higher computational cost than probabilistic models, recent progress with graphical belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> has made complex belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> computationally feasible. This {{is especially true in}} models which have a natural graphical structure such as that provided by fault trees. This paper explores the issues involved in constructing belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> for risk assessment by producing belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> for simple problems. In particular, it constructs belief <b>function</b> <b>models</b> for Bernoulli and Poisson processes and extends those models for simple series and parallel systems...|$|R

25|$|Newer {{functional}} neuroimaging techniques include functional {{magnetic resonance}} imaging and positron emission tomography, both of which track the flow of blood through the brain. These technologies provide more localized information about activity in the brain and create representations of the brain with widespread appeal. They also provide insight which avoids the classic problems of subjective self-reporting. It remains challenging to draw hard conclusions about where in the brain specific thoughts originate—or even how usefully such localization corresponds with reality. However, neuroimaging has delivered unmistakable results showing the existence of correlations between mind and brain. Some of these draw on a systemic neural network model rather than a localized <b>function</b> <b>model.</b>|$|E

40|$|Interdisciplinary system {{development}} requires {{the integration of}} diverse expertise to combine different engineering technologies and – increasingly often – services, {{in order to provide}} users with expected value and desired functionality in newly developed products. Failure to achieve integration of disciplines can result in design errors posing a direct threat to the users and to the company. <b>Function</b> <b>modelling</b> is expected to provide suitable means for the integration of disciplines early in the development process. However, a plethora of <b>function</b> <b>models</b> can be found within different disciplines or even across and their divergence has proven to hamper shared, cross-disciplinary <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> in design teams. This article presents research on <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> in different disciplines in practice. Conducted research comprises empirical studies in ten companies developing mechatronic systems and/or Product-Service Systems in diverse market areas. The studies provide insights into the utilisation of different <b>function</b> <b>models</b> in different disciplines and across, as well as the specific needs and preferences of practicing designers regarding interdisciplinary <b>function</b> <b>modelling.</b> Finally, the obtained insights and their implications for supporting interdisciplinary <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> are being discussed.

40|$|Raster {{modeling}} is {{an integral}} component of spatial analysis. However, conventional raster modeling techniques can require {{a substantial amount of}} processing time and storage space, often limiting the types of analyses that can be performed. To address this issue, we have developed <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling.</b> <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling</b> is a new modeling framework that streamlines the raster modeling process by utilizing lazy reading methodologies. To assess the efficacy of <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling,</b> we compared the processing time and storage space required to execute six simulation using our newly developed methodology and conventional modeling techniques. Our findings indicate that <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling</b> substantially reduces both processing time and storage space when compared to conventional modeling. Outside of simulations, we have used <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling</b> to characterize the impacts of fuel treatments on soil erosion given fire disturbance, estimate basal area, trees, and tons of above ground biomass per acre, identify locations in need of forest management, calculate forest residuals given multiple management prescriptions, and integrate spatially explicit delivery cost models with forest residual estimates in a fraction of the time and storage space it would take to perform similar analysis using conventional <b>modeling</b> methodologies. Overall, <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling</b> significantly improves how raster models are processed. To facilitate the use of <b>Function</b> <b>Modeling,</b> we built an object oriented.

An operator <b>function</b> <b>model</b> attempts to represent in mathematical form how an operator might decompose a complex system into simpler parts and coordinate control actions and system configurations so that acceptable overall system performance is achieved. The model represents basic issues of knowledge representation, information flow, and decision making in complex systems.

40|$|<b>Function</b> <b>modelling</b> is {{proposed}} in literature from different disciplines, in interdisciplinary approaches, {{and used in}} practice {{with the intention of}} facilitating system conceptualisation. However, <b>function</b> <b>models</b> across disciplines are largely diverse addressing different <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> perspectives and using different structures and forms for representing the contained information. This hampers the exchange of information between the models and poses particular challenges to joint modelling and shared comprehension between designers from different disciplines. This article proposes an integrated <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> framework, which specifically aims at relating between the different <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> perspectives prominently addressed in different disciplines. It uses interlinked matrices based on the concept of DSM and MDM in order to facilitate cross-disciplinary modelling and analysis of the functionality of a system.

Therein, feedback on the potential of the proposed framework to support interdisciplinary design practice as well as on areas of further improvement has been obtained from participants working in industry...|$|R

40|$|Industry {{is confronted}} with ever-changing and {{increasing}} demand of customers on global markets for integration of diverse functions into newly developed products and systems. As a consequence, companies increasingly often combine different engineering technologies into their products necessitating close collaboration of experts from various disciplines. New types of products, such as Product-Service Systems (PSS), {{which have become}} increasingly important {{in the recent past}} and combine (multi-disciplinary) products with associated services, extend interdisciplinary system development by including further disciplines. Problems in the (cross-disciplinary) exchange of information between the involved designers are considered one of the central risks posed to the success of interdisciplinary system development. <b>Function</b> <b>modelling</b> is expected to provide suitable means for the integration of different disciplines, as it addresses solution finding early in the design process and results in a first abstract representation of the system under consideration. However, a large variety of different and often incompatible <b>function</b> <b>models</b> {{can be found in the}} different disciplines, which hampers shared, cross-disciplinary <b>function</b> <b>modelling.</b> The research project presented in this thesis provides comprehensive insights into central barriers and enablers for cross-disciplinary <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> in the development of mechatronic systems and PSS. Conducted research comprises comprehensive literature reviews of diverse <b>function</b> <b>models</b> and <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> approaches proposed in disciplinary and interdisciplinary design approaches. The derived insights are complemented by empirical studies in ten companies active in diverse market areas, such as machine design, automotive, aerospace, and consumer product development. The empirical studies provide compelling insights into the actual application of <b>function</b> <b>modelling</b> in different disciplines and design departments, as well as into specific needs and preferences of practicing designers from different disciplines. A central contribution resulting from this research is the ”Integrated <b>Function</b> <b>Modelling</b> framework”, which is intended to address the identified needs and provide practicing designers with a flexible and generic modelling approach supporting interdisciplinary conceptual design.
