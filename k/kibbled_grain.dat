40|$|Due to the {{different}} effects on the human health {{it is necessary to}} avoid excessive or insufficient consumption of iodine. Iodine deficiency weakens the synthesis of the thyroid hormones, causes hypothyroidism and can lead to various developmental and functional disturbances known as the disorders from iodine deficiency. The latest literary knowledge about the use of iodine in the broiler chickens identifies the concentration of iodine 5 mg per kg feed as safe for a given group of the animals. Working Group on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed of   Panel on Additives and Products or Substances used in Animal Feed notes that the maximum authorized limit of iodine in the feed of the broiler chickens 10 mg per kg does not represent a health risk. The aim of our research was an observation and assessment of the effect of feed mixtures with iodized oil on production quality of the line hybrid chickens Cobb 500 and selected indicators of breast muscle. For comparison, a control group consists of the chickens, which were fed the feed mixtures without iodized oil. Dietary iodine in the form of potassium iodide was applied to sunflower oil. The mixture was heated at 70 °C with continuous stirring until dissolution of potassium iodide. The content of iodine in iodine suplement was 0. 04   mg per g per 1 kg of feed mixture of starter, growth and the finisher was used 5 g of iodine supplement. The oil mixture was mixed into <b>kibbled</b> <b>grain</b> of corn and carefully homogenized with other components of   the feed mixtures. To meet the aim of research, we realized an experiment, where body weight of the chickens was observed {{at the end of the}} experiment, the breast muscle weight and chemical analysis was made from selected indicators of breast muscle. A body weight of broiler chickens at the beginning and the end of the experiment and a breast muscle weight were observed by weighing on the Kern ECB 20 K 20 type scale with an accuracy of d = 0, 1 g. The breast muscles were analyzed for selected indicators according to the methodology for analytical laboratories (2009). The data were evaluated according to the basic statistical characteristics.   The differences in the values of indicators between groups were evaluated by the SAS system program by t-test. The broiler chickens that were included in the experiment were first grade with a balanced average weight of 42 g. Statistical evaluation    of body weight of the broiler chickens at the beginning of the experiment results in not significant difference between the control group and the experimental group – iodine supplement. Average body weight of the chickens was 2183. 06 g at end of experiment in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 2145. 21 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average weight of the breast muscles was 426. 83 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 412. 11 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average dry matter content      in the breast muscles was 26. 13 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 26. 25 g per 100 g in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P > 0. 05). Average protein contents in breast muscles was 23. 63 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 23. 31 g per 100 g   in control group with a statistically not significant difference (P> 0. 05). Average fat contents in breast muscles was 1. 05 g per 100 g in the group with the addition of iodine compared to 0. 88  g per 100 g in control group with a statistically significant difference (P The results of the experiment indicated some tendency of the positive effect of the feed mixtures with iodized oil on the quality of production of broiler chickens. Based on results, further research was recommended.   Normal 0 false false false SK X-NONE X-NONE <w:LsdExc...|$|E
50|$|It is {{a typical}} Irish stone tower mill, with a {{moveable}} cap turned {{by means of an}} automatic fantail, ensuring that the sails always faced into the wind. When the wind blows directly onto the sails the blades or vanes of the fantail are not moved. However, if the wind veers, it catches the blades and the whole cap turns on an iron ring or ‘curb’, bringing the sails back into the wind. As well as the ground floor the mill has three storeys - a ‘drive’ floor, ‘stone’ floor and ‘hopper’ floor, from the first to third level respectively. The rotating cap sits above the hopper floor. Three pairs of millstones sit at the ‘stone’ floor - one set for making wheatmeal, one for shelling the grains of corn (a process which separated the useless ‘hulls’ from the valuable ‘seeds’ or grain) and a set for grinding grains into oatmeal. The power of the wind is transmitted back from the sails or ‘sweeps’ by means of the central ‘windshaft’ passing back into the cap. On the inner end of the rotating windshaft is the ‘brake wheel’ which drives a bevel gearwheel or ‘wallower’ perched on top of the main (vertical) driveshaft. This power turns the three sets of grinding stones below. The sails would have been covered with canvas sailcloth. The amount of sailcloth used determined the amount of power and this would have been adjusted from within the cap, even while the sails were turning, to suit the particular grinding requirements at any given time. Ballycopeland produced oatmeal and wheatmeal for human consumption, as well as animal feed such as shelled and bruised oats, yellow meal (from maize), <b>kibbled</b> (crushed) <b>grain</b> for poultry and ground peas and beans.|$|R
