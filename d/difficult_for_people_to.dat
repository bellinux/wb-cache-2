25|$|Body image {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} {{psychological}} effects and physical effects. Throughout history, it has been extremely <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> live up to the standards of society and what they believe the ideal body is. There are many factors that lead to a person’s body image, some of these include: family dynamics, mental illness, biological predispositions and environmental causes for obesity or malnutrition, and cultural expectations (e.g., media and politics). People who are both underweight and overweight can have poor body image. However, because people are constantly told and shown the cosmetic appeal of weight loss and are warned about the risks of obesity, those who are normal or overweight on the BMI scale have higher risks of poor body image. This is something that can lead to a change in a person's body image. Often, people who have a low body image will try to alter their bodies in some way, such as by dieting or undergoing cosmetic surgery.|$|E
25|$|As President Bush's AIDS Coordinator, Tobias was {{responsible}} for setting policy detailing which countries would receive monies from various US agencies, how much, and what the rules governing assignment of those funds would be. As AIDS Coordinator, he discussed the rules {{in an interview with}} PBS' Frontline where he detailed a legal requirement that recipients of U.S. aid denounce prostitution:The Congress I think very appropriately has put into the legislation that created this program that organizations, in order to receive money, need to have a policy opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking. I don't think it's too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be opposed to prostitution and sex trafficking, which are in fact two contributing causes to the spread of HIV/AIDS. I think when organizations initially became aware of that requirement, some organizations were concerned about what the implications of that might be, but we implemented that in the first year with non-U.S. organizations. We're now implementing that requirement with U.S. organizations. And so far, I really know of no problems that we've had on the ground.|$|E

500|$|Small {{islands of}} trees growing on land raised between [...] and [...] above sloughs and prairies are called {{tropical}} hardwood hammocks. They may range from one (4,000m²) to ten acres (40,000m²) in area, and appear in freshwater sloughs, sawgrass prairies, or pineland. Hammocks are slightly elevated on limestone plateaus risen several {{inches above the}} surrounding peat, or they may grow on land that has been unharmed by deep peat fires. Hardwood hammocks exhibit a mixture of subtropical and hardwood trees, such as Southern live oak (Quercus virginiana), gumbo limbo (Bursera simaruba), royal palm (Roystonea), and bustic (Dipholis salicifolia) that grow in very dense clumps. Near the base, sharp saw palmettos (Serenoa repens) flourish, making the hammocks very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> penetrate, though small mammals, reptiles and amphibians find these islands an ideal habitat. Water in sloughs flows around the islands, creating moats. Though some ecosystems are maintained and promoted by fire, hammocks may take decades or centuries to recover.

[...] Seth pines for a past not his own and obsessively collects consumer items from earlier in the 20th century. [...] His focus is primarily on the period from the 1930s to the 1950s, a time he feels particularly [...] "Canadian". [...] He goes as far as to wear an old-fashioned overcoat and broad-rimmed hat, for which passing teenagers taunt him, saying he looks like Clark Kent or Dick Tracy. [...] He declares to Chester: [...] "I do think life was simpler then... easier for people to find personal happiness." [...] Brown disagrees, saying, [...] "I think it's always been <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> be happy." [...] Seth dreads the future and allows his memories of childhood to dominate his thoughts, but recognizes and criticizes his own obsessions: [...] "There's something in the decay of old things that provokes an evocative sadness for the vanished past. [...] If those buildings were perfectly preserved it wouldn't be the same." [...] Despite this consciousness, he continues to pursue his collecting.|$|E

2500|$|A second {{rationale}} for using nonsubordination theory to explain domestic violence, beyond {{the variety of}} tactics used by abusers, is that {{the frequency with which}} domestic violence occurs overpowers the idea that it is merely the result of a batterer’s anger. [...] Professor Mahoney explains that because of the sensationalism generated in media coverage of “big” or particularly horrific domestic violence cases, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> conceptualize how frequently domestic violence happens in society. [...] However, domestic violence is a regular occurrence experienced by up to one half of people in the United States, and an overwhelming number of victims are female. [...] The sheer number of domestic violence victims in the United States suggests that domestic violence is not merely the result of intimate partners who cannot control their anger. [...] Nonsubordination theory contends that it is the batterer’s desire to subordinate the victim, not his uncontainable anger, which explains the frequency of domestic violence. [...] Nonsubordination theorists argue that other forms of feminist legal theory do not offer any explanation for the phenomenon of domestic violence generally or the frequency with which it occurs.|$|E
2500|$|The single was {{released}} with two B-sides: [...] "Multiple Exposure" [...] and [...] "Boku to Hana (Sakanaction Remix)". [...] "Multiple Exposure" [...] is an original song written with a chill-out style, which Yamaguchi wrote {{to counter the}} band's most recent songs, the wide audience-focused [...] "Boku to Hana", [...] "Moment" [...] and [...] "Yoru no Odoriko". An inner focused song, [...] "Multiple Exposure" [...] {{was created by the}} band trusted their initial, naturally occurring feelings, showing off to the band newer audience {{what they wanted to do}} musically. Yamaguchi thought that his lyrics would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> interpret, however felt that they were right for the song as they were how Yamaguchi thought naturally. The lyrics contrasted with the [...] "juvenile" [...] lyrical impression of [...] "Yoru no Odoriko", and were written as a realistic discussion of modern society. The second song, [...] "Boku to Hana (Sakanaction Remix)", was the first time the band had released a remix that they had produced themselves. As the song was produced for the drama 37-sai de Isha ni Natta Boku: Kenshui Junjō Monogatari (2012), the remix of the song was how the band would have performed [...] "Boku to Hana" [...] if it had not needed to be a pop song intended for a wide audience of drama viewers. Primarily made by bassist Ami Kusakari and drummer Keiichi Ejima without any input by Yamaguchi, the remix was a version of the song that replaced the song's pop sound with a more club-oriented dance sound. Two versions of the physical single were released: a CD only edition and a CD/DVD edition. The DVD featured material recorded in binaural audio at the pre-show performance of their June 19, 2012 performance at Zepp Tokyo.|$|E
6000|$|The {{relative}} {{amount of}} the United States public debt may be seen, [...] by Chart No. XXII, from an early date down to 1880. Since the war, [...] the surplus revenue of the United States has been constantly [...] appropriated for the payment of the public debt incurred during [...] the late war, until, what with the reduction of debt and the fall [...] in the interest charge, our income is now so much greater than [...] expenditure that we are (1884) actually in difficulties owing to [...] the surplus. To the present time the Treasury {{has been able to}} use [...] its excess of receipts in redeeming matured debt; but the rapidity [...] of the payment has been such that in two years or more no matured [...] debt will exist to be redeemed: $250,000,000 of 4-½ per cent bonds [...] remain, but they do not fall due until 1891; and the 4 per cent [...] bonds to the amount of $737,620,700 do not mature until 1907. [...] Having once raised a large revenue under war pressure, it seems [...] very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>people</b> <b>to</b> understand now why heavy duties were [...] originally levied, and the extraordinary suggestion is often made [...] that the surplus should remain, and new channels of expenditure [...] should be made (such as enormous pensions), simply in order to [...] keep up the heavy taxation. The difficulty is, however, that the [...] unnecessary surplus exists because of customs duties levied for [...] war purposes. But the heavy burden of war taxation ought not to be [...] continued, adding to the cost of production in all industries, [...] without doing a greater wrong than would be done by the [...] passing—and only possible—trouble of a redistribution of capital [...] in a few cases; especially since that distribution of capital will [...] be one from less productive to more productive industries; [...] otherwise, no change would be made.|$|E
