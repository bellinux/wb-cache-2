30|$|Inspired by {{the work}} [33] of input {{estimation}} in the inverse heating problem without the time history of external input, we proposed a biomechanical constrained sequential filtering framework which performs multiframe estimation of the nonrigid myocardial kinematic function and <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of system simultaneously from medical image sequence. Our work is also developed from earlier works like the state-space-based motion recovery algorithms with the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> constructed from boundaries [21, 24] and model-based filtering framework with <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> simulated from an electromechanical coupling model [30]. Contrary to previous approaches using deterministic approximation of <b>external</b> <b>loads,</b> our proposed framework treats <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> as a stochastic input after the biomechanical model is converted into a stochastic state-space representation, which is more rational because of largely unknown knowledge of <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of each patient's heart. Since the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> in our approach are treated as a stochastic variable, we start to call <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> as input forces from here, which is a proper description in the stochastic control theory [22]. Therefore, the main difference of our work to previous multiframe estimation efforts is that rather than making ad hoc mathematical assumptions {{on the behavior of}} input forces, we allow uncertainties inside input forces because of unobservable loading condition of the heart, which is a better description of clinical situation from the stochastic control theory point of view. To achieve optimal estimation, we cyclically feed the updated estimation of input forces and imaging-derived data into the filtering framework until reaching largely data-driven convergence: a Kalman filter is first used to generate the residual innovation sequences without input forces, followed by a recursive least-square filter which is derived to use the sequences of residual innovation to compute values of input forces to the myocardium. Finally, myocardial kinematic function can be recovered by using the estimated input forces.|$|R
25|$|As the pennate {{muscle is}} activated, the fibers rotate as they shorten and pull {{at an angle}}. In pennate muscles, fibers are {{oriented}} {{at an angle to}} the muscle's line of action and rotate as they shorten, becoming more oblique such that the fraction of force directed along the muscle's line of action decreases throughout a contraction. Force output is dependent upon the angle of fiber rotation, so changes in muscle thickness and the vector of change in thickness vary; based upon the force being produced. Due to the rotational motion; pennate muscles operate at low velocities (low shortening distance). The shortening velocity of the pennate muscle as a whole is greater than that of the individual fibers. This gives rise to the property of AGR. Fiber rotation decreases a muscle's output force but increases output velocity by allowing the muscle to function at a higher gear ratio (muscle velocity/fiber velocity). Azizi and Brainerd demonstrated that the gear ratio of pennate muscle can vary; dependent on <b>external</b> <b>load.</b>|$|E

40|$|A time-domain {{filtering}} {{algorithm is}} proposed to recover myocardial kinematic function using output-only measurements without the time history of <b>external</b> <b>loads.</b> The main contribution of this work is that the overall effect of all the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> on the myocardium is treated as a random variable disturbed by the Gaussian white noise because the <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of the myocardium are usually unknown in practical exercises. The kernel of our proposed algorithm is an iterative, multiframe, and sequential filtering procedure consisting of a Kalman filter and a least-squares filter. In our proposed implementation, the initial guess of myocardial kinematic function and residual innovation of all the state variables are first computed using a Kalman filter via state space equations only driven by the Gaussian white noise, and then the residual innovation is fed into a least-squares filter to estimate the total <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> of the myocardium. In the end, the initial guess of myocardial kinematic function is corrected using <b>external</b> <b>loads</b> provided by the least-squares filter. After {{the introduction of the}} whole structure of our algorithm, we demonstrate the ability of the framework on synthetic data and MR image sequences. </p...|$|R

During high-speed movements <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> increases both the magnitude (FT) and rate (RFDT) of tendon loading. Purpose The influence of <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> on muscle and tendon dynamics during maximal vertical jumping was explored. Methods Ten resistance-trained men performed parallel-depth, countermovement vertical jumps {{with and without}} additional load (0 %, 30 %, 60 %, and 90 % of maximum squat lift strength), while joint kinetics and kinematics, quadriceps tendon length (LT) and patellar tendon FT and RFDT were estimated using integrated ultrasound, motion analysis and force platform data and muscle tendon modelling. Results Estimated FT and RFDT, but not peak LT, increased with <b>external</b> <b>loading.</b> Temporal comparisons between 0 % and 90 % loads revealed that FT was greater with 90 % loading throughout {{the majority of the}} movement (11 %- 81 % and 87 %- 95 % movement duration). However, RFDT was greater with 90 % load only during the early movement initiation phase (8 %- 15 % movement duration) but was greater in the 0 % load condition later in the eccentric phase (27 %- 38 % movement duration). LT was longer during the early movement (12 %- 23 % movement duration) but shorter in the late eccentric and early concentric phases (48 %- 55 % movement duration) with 90 % <b>load.</b> Discussion <b>External</b> <b>loading</b> positively influenced peak FT and RFDT but tendon strain appeared unaffected, suggesting no additive effect of <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> on patellar tendon lengthening during human jumping. Temporal analysis revealed that <b>external</b> <b>loading</b> resulted in a large initial RFDT that may have caused dynamic stiffening of the tendon and attenuated tendon strain throughout the movement.
