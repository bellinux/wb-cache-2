25|$|The weak {{visibility}} of the postulated plume in tomographic {{images of the}} lower mantle and the geochemical evidence for <b>eclogite</b> in the mantle source {{have led to the}} theory that Iceland is not underlain by a mantle plume at all, but that the volcanism there results from processes related to plate tectonics and is restricted to the upper mantle.|$|E

For instance, <b>eclogite</b> {{can be defined}} as a rock of basalt composition, but mainly consisting of garnet and omphacite. Pyrope-rich garnet is restricted to relatively high-pressure metamorphic rocks, such as those in the lower crust and in the Earth's mantle. Peridotite may contain plagioclase, or aluminium-rich spinel, or pyrope-rich garnet, and the presence of each of the three minerals defines a pressure-temperature range in which the mineral could equilibrate with olivine plus pyroxene: the three are listed in order of increasing pressure for stability of the peridotite mineral assemblage. Hence, garnet peridotite must have been formed at great depth in the earth. Xenoliths of garnet peridotite have been carried up from depths of [...] and greater by kimberlite, and garnets from such disaggegated xenoliths are used as a kimberlite indicator minerals in diamond prospecting. At depths of about [...] and greater, a pyroxene component is dissolved in garnet, by the substitution of (Mg,Fe) plus Si for 2Al in the octahedral (Y) site in the garnet structure, creating unusually silica-rich garnets that have solid solution towards majorite. Such silica-rich garnets have been identified as inclusions within diamonds.|$|E

Below about , all of the minerals of the upper mantle begin to become unstable. The most abundant minerals present, the silicate perovskites, have structures (but not compositions) like that of the mineral perovskite followed by the magnesium/iron oxide ferropericlase. The changes in mineralogy at about [...] yield distinctive signatures in seismic records of the Earth's interior, and like the moho, are readily detected using seismic waves. These changes in mineralogy may influence mantle convection, as they result in density changes and they may absorb or release latent heat as well as depress or elevate the depth of the polymorphic phase transitions for regions of different temperatures. The changes in mineralogy with depth have been investigated by laboratory experiments that duplicate high mantle pressures, such as those using the diamond anvil.|$|E

The high-Fe–Ti (HFT) <b>eclogites</b> have small to moderate LILE enrichment and lack Nb anomalies. The REE patterns of the HFT <b>eclogites</b> are characterized by LREE depletion and relatively flat MREE–HREE patterns.

We interpret the HFT suite to represent a later stage in an evolution from continental rift to open ocean, following the origin of the LFT suite. Dyke amphibolite compositions, except for probable SiO_ 2 loss associated with metamorphic dehydration reactions, appear to represent liquid compositions quenched in conduits through the lower crust. MELTS modeling shows that dyke amphibolite compositions can be related to each other by fractional crystallization under strongly oxidizing conditions at ~ 0. 5 GPa pressure, and all can be derived from a low-degree melt of modified fertile peridotite from around 1. 7 GPa.

40|$|Slab-derived fluids play a {{key role}} in mass {{transfer}} and elemental/isotopic exchanges in subduction zones. The exhumation of deeply subducted crust is achieved via a subduction channel where fluids from various sources are abundant, and thus the chemical/isotopic compositions of these rocks could have been modified by subduction-zone fluid–rock interactions. Here, we investigate the Mg isotopic systematics of <b>eclogites</b> from southwestern Tianshan, in conjunction with major/trace element and Sr-Nd isotopes, to characterize the source and nature of fluids and to decipher how fluid–rock interactions in subduction channel might influence the Mg isotopic systematics of exhumed <b>eclogites.</b> The <b>eclogites</b> have high LILEs (especially Ba) and Pb, high initial 87 Sr/ 86 Sr (up to 0. 7117; higher than that of coeval seawater), and varying Ni and Co (mostly lower than those of oceanic basalts), suggesting that these <b>eclogites</b> have interacted with metamorphic fluids mainly released from subducted sediments, with minor contributions from altered oceanic crust or altered abyssal peridotites. The positive correlation between 87 Sr/ 86 Sr and Pb* (an index of Pb enrichment; Pb* = 2 *PbN/[CeN + PrN]), and the decoupling relationships and bidirectional patterns in 87 Sr/ 86 Sr-Rb/Sr, Pb*-Rb/Sr and Pb*-Ba/Pb spaces imply the presence of two compositionally different components for the fluids: one enriched in LILEs, and the other enriched in Pb and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr. The systematically heavier Mg isotopic compositions (δ 26 Mg = − 0. 37 to + 0. 26) relative to oceanic basalts (− 0. 25 ± 0. 07) and the roughly negative correlation of δ 26 Mg with MgO for the southwestern Tianshan <b>eclogites,</b> cannot be explained by inheritance of Mg isotopic signatures from ancient seafloor alteration or prograde metamorphism. Instead, the signatures are most likely produced by fluid–rock interactions during the exhumation of <b>eclogites.</b> The high Rb/Sr and Ba/Pb but low Pb* <b>eclogites</b> generally have high bulk-rock δ 26 Mg values, whereas high Pb* and 87 Sr/ 86 Sr <b>eclogites</b> have mantle-like δ 26 Mg values, suggesting that the two fluid components have diverse influences on the Mg isotopic systematics of these <b>eclogites.</b> The LILE-rich fluid component, possibly derived from mica-group minerals, contains a considerable amount of isotopically heavy Mg that has shifted the δ 26 Mg of the <b>eclogites</b> towards higher values. By contrast, the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr- and Pb-rich fluid component, most likely released from epidote-group minerals in metasediments, has little Mg so as not to modify the Mg isotopic composition of the <b>eclogites.</b> In addition, the influence of talc-derived fluid might be evident in a very few <b>eclogites</b> that have low Rb/Sr and Ba/Pb but slightly heavier Mg isotopic compositions.
