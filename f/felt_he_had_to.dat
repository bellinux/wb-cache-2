5|$|Garrett's Miss Pawhuska (1946–1975) was a Quarter Horse broodmare who {{produced}} eight foals, {{three of which}} would become world champion race horses. When she was a yearling, she was sold by her owner, although he had not really planned on selling her. He <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> because one of his employees had told a customer the filly was for sale.|$|E
5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> prove himself because of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|In Globe, Arizona, Burnham unwittingly {{joined the}} losing side of the Pleasant Valley War before mass killing started, and only {{narrowly}} escaped death. He had no stake in the feud, but he was drawn into the conflict by his association with the Gordon family. Once the killing started, he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> join a faction as a hired gun, although it {{put him on the}} wrong side of the law. In between raids and forays, he practiced incessantly with his pistol; he learned to shoot using either hand and from the back of a galloping horse. Even after his faction admitted defeat (the feud would begin again years later), Burnham still had many enemies.|$|E

5|$|The {{next year}} the Capitols went 28–20 but were {{eliminated}} from the playoffs in a one-game Western Division tie-breaker. In the 1948–49 BAA season, the Caps won their first 15 games and finished the season at 38–22. The team reached the BAA Finals, but were beaten by the Minneapolis Lakers, who were led by Hall-of-Fame center George Mikan. In the next season, the BAA and the rival league National Basketball League merged to become the NBA, and Auerbach <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> rebuild his squad. However, owner Uline declined his proposals, and Auerbach resigned.|$|E
5|$|Director Scott Derrickson {{admired the}} {{original}} film's director Robert Wise, {{whom he met}} as a film student. He generally dislikes remakes, but he enjoyed the script, which he decided was a retelling {{of the story and}} not a true remake. He also explained that The Day the Earth Stood Still is not a widely seen classic film, unlike The Wizard of Oz, which he would not bother remaking. Derrickson's benchmark was Philip Kaufman's 1978 remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers. Klaatu was made more menacing than in the original, because the director <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> symbolize the more complex era of the 2000s. There was debate over whether to have Klaatu land in Washington, D.C., as in the original; but Derrickson chose New York City because he liked the geometry of Klaatu's sphere landing in Central Park. Derrickson also did not write in Gort's original backstory, which was already absent from the script he read. He already thought the script was a good adaptation and didn't want the negative connotations of fascism from the original film.|$|E
25|$|Lois' {{first real}} {{relationship}} in this version was with Jose Delgado, a Metropolis vigilante whose legs are shattered {{in a battle}} with a Lexcorp cyborg/human hybrid gone amok. Delgado eventually recovered. He and Lois would have several on and off experiences together before the relationship completely disintegrated, due to Delgado accepting help from a Lexcorp subsidiary ARL and Lois' attraction to Superman with whom Delgado <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> compete.|$|E

25|$|Charles {{correctly}} {{assumed that}} 'Abd-al-Raḥmân would {{feel compelled to}} give battle, and move on and try to loot Tours. Neither side wanted to attack. Abd-al-Raḥmân <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> sack Tours, which meant {{he had to go}} through the Frankish army on the hill in front of him. Charles's decision to wait and stay on the hills proved crucial, as it forced the Umayyad Cavalry to charge uphill and through trees, diminishing their lethality.|$|E
25|$|In August 1937 {{he went to}} Singapore under a fake Chinese {{identity}} and became a teacher. After the Dutch surrendered to Japan he returned to Indonesia via Penang. He then sailed to Sumatra arriving in Jakarta in mid-1942, where he wrote Madilog. After he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> have a job, he applied to Social Welfare Agency and was soon sent to a coal mine in Bayah, on southern coast of West Java.|$|E
25|$|After {{the success}} of the {{previous}} Ayreon release, Into the Electric Castle, Arjen <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> create an album that was a worthy release all on its own, without being derivative or treading on similar ground. To this end, he made some fundamental changes to his previous composition process. Arjen decided to have each vocalist only sing one track each, as opposed to the almost conversational, rock opera-style singing which was utilized in previous albums.|$|E

25|$|The defendants' radical {{politics}} {{may have}} played a role in the verdict. Judge Thayer, though a sworn enemy of anarchists, warned the defense against bringing anarchism into the trial. Yet defense attorney Fred Moore <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> call both Sacco and Vanzetti as witnesses to let them explain why they were fully armed when arrested. Both men testified that they had been rounding up radical literature when apprehended, and that they had feared another government deportation raid. Yet both hurt their case with rambling discourses on radical politics that the prosecution mocked. The prosecution also brought out that both men had fled the draft by going to Mexico in 1917.|$|E
25|$|Codreanu <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> {{amend the}} purpose of the {{movement}} after more than two years of stagnation: he and the leadership of the movement started touring rural regions, addressing the churchgoing illiterate population with the rhetoric of sermons, dressing up in long white mantles and instigating Christian prejudice against Judaism (this intense campaign was also prompted {{by the fact that the}} Legion was immediately sidelined by Cuza's League in the traditional Moldavian and Bukovinan centers). Between 1928 and 1930, the Alexandru Vaida-Voevod National Peasants' Party cabinet gave tacit assistance to the Guard, but Iuliu Maniu (representing the same party) clamped down on the Legion after July 1930. This came after the latter had tried to provoke a wave of pogroms in Maramureș and Bessarabia. In one notable incident of 1930, Legionaries encouraged the peasant population of Borșa to attack the town's 4,000 Jews. The Legion had also attempted to assassinate government officials and journalists — including Constantin Angelescu, undersecretary of Internal Affairs. Codreanu was briefly arrested together with the would-be assassin Gheorghe Beza: both were tried and acquitted. Nevertheless, the wave of violence and a planned march into Bessarabia signalled the outlawing of the party by Premier Gheorghe Mironescu and Minister of the Interior Ion Mihalache (January 1931); again arrested, Codreanu was acquitted in late February.|$|E
25|$|John left Portugal for Aquitaine, and he {{remained}} in that province until he returned to England in November 1389. This effectively kept him off the scene while England endured the major political crisis of the conflict between Richard II and the Lords Appellant, who were led by John of Gaunt's younger brother Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester. Only four months after his return to England, in March 1390, Richard II formally invested Gaunt with the Duchy of Aquitaine, thus providing him with the overseas territory he had long desired. However he did not immediately return to the province, but remained in England and mainly ruled through seneschals as an absentee duke. His administration of the province was a disappointment, and his appointment as duke was much resented by the Gascons, since Aquitaine had previously always been held directly by the king of England or his heir; it was not felt to be a fief that a king could bestow on a subordinate. In 1394–95, {{he was forced to}} spend nearly a year in Gascony to shore up his position in the face of threats of secession by the Gascon nobles. He was one of England's principal negotiators in the diplomatic exchanges with France that led to the Truce of Leulingham in 1396, and he initially agreed to join the French-led Crusade that ended in the disastrous Battle of Nicopolis, but withdrew due to ill-health and the political problems in Gascony and England. For the remainder of his life, John of Gaunt occupied the role of valued counsellor of the king and loyal supporter of the Crown. He did not even protest, it seems, when his younger brother Thomas was murdered at Richard's behest. It may be that he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> maintain this posture of loyalty to protect his son Henry Bolingbroke (the future Henry IV), who had also been one of the Lords Appellant, from Richard's wrath; but in 1398 Richard had Bolingbroke exiled, and on John of Gaunt's death the next year he disinherited Bolingbroke completely, seizing John's vast estates for the Crown.|$|E
50|$|On 12 December, Vice-Minister of the Interior Panagiotis Chinofotis, as a {{political}} leader of the Greek Police, said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> ask for forgiveness for the shooting incident and the resulting death of Alexandros Grigoropoulos, since neither the defendant nor the defendant's lawyer did so.|$|R

500|$|Cobain {{described}} {{the sound of}} Nirvana when it first started as [...] "a Gang of Four and Scratch Acid ripoff". Later when Nirvana recorded Bleach, Cobain <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fit {{the expectations of the}} Sub Pop grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record in favor of a more rocking sound. Nirvana biographer Michael Azerrad argued, [...] "Ironically, it was the restrictions of the Sub Pop sound that helped the band find its musical identity". Azerrad stated that by acknowledging that its members had grown up listening to Black Sabbath and Aerosmith, the band was able to move on from its derivative early sound.|$|E
500|$|By the 1920s, {{there was}} still little {{published}} in English about the French marshals, and Phipps' proposed Lives of the Marshals was enthusiastically anticipated by scholars of the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars. Despite his diligent activity on the project, Phipps' work was complicated by the regular appearance of new material, which he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> read, verify, and digest; he sometimes incorporated the new material into his own work, and sometimes counter-balanced it with other material. Phipps was convinced {{of the importance of}} his subject, particularly the experience of the future marshals in the Republican armies. The French field armies of the Revolutionary Wars (17931800) formed the military education of the future marshals. Although there was great interest in the marshals, little had been published in either French or English about their early military experience. Phipps called these revolutionary armies the Schools for Marshals. Furthermore, he postulated, [...] "the Consulate and the Empire cannot be judged until the Revolutionary period has been studied in detail." ...|$|E

These doubts came {{from the fact that}} <b>he</b> <b>had</b> not released a solo studio album since The Chronic (1992). He stated: ...|$|R

500|$|Pine {{described}} his first audition as [...] "awful", {{because he could}} not take himself seriously as a leader. Abrams did not see Pine's first audition, and it was only after Pine's agent met Abrams' wife that the director decided to give him another audition opposite Quinto. Quinto was supportive of Pine's casting because they knew each other from working out at the same gym. After getting the part, Pine sent William Shatner a letter and received a reply containing Shatner's approval. Pine watched classic episodes and read encyclopedias about the Star Trek universe, but stopped as he felt weighed down by the feeling he had to copy Shatner. Pine <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> show Kirk's [...] "humor, arrogance and decisiveness," [...] but not Shatner's speech pattern, which would have bordered on imitation. Pine said that when watching the original series, he was also struck by how Shatner's performance was characterized by humor. Instead, Pine chose to incorporate elements of Tom Cruise from Top Gun and Harrison Ford's portrayals of Indiana Jones and Han Solo. Chris Pratt also auditioned for the role.|$|E
500|$|According to Cobain, {{the music}} on Bleach {{conformed}} with the grunge genre Sub Pop heavily endorsed. [...] "There was this pressure from Sub Pop and the grunge scene to play 'rock music'", Cobain said, and noted that he [...] " [...] it down and [...] it sound like Aerosmith." [...] Cobain also <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fit {{the expectations of the}} grunge sound to build a fanbase, and hence suppressed his arty and pop songwriting traits while crafting the record. Krist Novoselic said in a 2001 interview with Rolling Stone that the band had played a tape in their tour van that had an album by The Smithereens on one side and one by the extreme metal band Celtic Frost on the other, and noted that the combination probably played an influence as well. The songs were described as [...] "deliberately bleak, claustrophobic, and lyrically sparse, with none of the manic derangement or sense of release of the live performance". Cobain said that the song structures were [...] "one–dimensional", and said that he sought to present a more [...] "polished and urbane side of happy".|$|E
500|$|Arsenal {{were drawn}} in Group E, along with Dutch champions PSV, Greek club Panathinaikos and Norwegian side Rosenborg. An Alex own goal {{was enough for}} Arsenal to claim three points against PSV on the first matchday. The team drew away to Rosenborg and earnt a point at Panathinaikos, despite twice having taken the lead at the Apostolos Nikolaidis Stadium. In the reverse fixture, Cygan scored an own goal to cancel out Henry's first-half opener; the result left Arsenal in second position. Their next match was against PSV at the Philips Stadion, where after eight minutes the home side took the lead. Henry {{equalised}} for Arsenal, having created the chance following a one-two with Ljungberg. In the second half Lauren and Vieira were both sent off, for two bookable offences. Wenger accepted referee Herbert Fandel's decision, but added his surprise that Mark van Bommel was not cautioned: [...] "If {{you look at the}} number of fouls he made without being punished it is very surprising because he made some deliberate fouls. Some people might criticise Patrick when we were down to 10 men but he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> fight harder to win the ball." ...|$|E
50|$|Music {{played a}} {{significant}} role throughout Chōmei's life. His musical mentor, Nakahara Ariyasu, was instrumental in his development, and Chōmei, known as Kikudaifu by his audience, was noted for his skill. According to an account by Minamoto no Ienaga, Chōmei's love for music was revealed in the sorrow <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> when <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> return a biwa (lute) called Tenari to the emperor.|$|R
50|$|Steve Fox {{left the}} {{band in the}} middle of the band's golden era because he {{converted}} to Christianity, as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> make a serious commitment with his faith. From the 1980s to the 1990s, Fox engaged in missionary work in Japan and Hawaii, and he broadcast an evangelistic radio program. In 1999, Steve Fox rejoined Godiego.|$|R
60|$|After {{the lonely}} {{anchorage}} and desolate surf-beaten coast, {{the noise and}} traffic in the streets were strange.
