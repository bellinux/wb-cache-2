40|$|For a {{circular}} sector system consisting of an elastic shell and an incompressible <b>frictionless</b> <b>liquid</b> layer {{with a free}} surface, the coupled liquid-structure frequencies are determined and compared with the natural (uncoupled) frequencies of the shell and the liquid. The coupled frequencies exhibit always smaller values than those of liquid and shell alone. The deviation increases with decreasing thickness of the liquid layer. (orig.)

40|$|A {{circular}} cylindrical {{liquid column}} between two discs and anchored liquid edges changes {{under the influence}} of axial gravity its static form to an amphora-type geometry. For such a geometry the natural frequencies of axisymmetric vibrations have been determined for a <b>frictionless</b> <b>liquid</b> column of height h and diameter 2 (a+r_ 0 (z)). It was found that the natural frequencies decrease in comparision with a perfect cirucular cylindrical bridge with the increase of the Bond number. (orig.)

40|$|Disordered materials, such as window glass, powders, gels, {{concentrated}} emulsions, differ tremendously {{in their}} microscopic detail, {{there is increasing}} evidence that they belong to a more general phenomenon known as jamming. The response of disordered materials to applied stresses is a particularly interesting but difficult problem with broad applications in many fields. Using confocal microscopy, we performed systematic and detailed measurements of inter-drop contact forces inside three-dimensional piles of <b>frictionless</b> <b>liquid</b> droplets. We found chain-like structures of contact forces called force chains and measured long-range correlations of the directions and magnitudes of large forces. These correlations arise from the tendency of two largest forces on a droplet to oppose one another. Furthermore, we found that piles whose height was comparable {{to the length of}} force chains exhibited greater strain hardening than did tall piles. Thus, we established a connection between the microscopic force network and the elastic response of meso- or macroscopic disordered materials. A statistical model that incorporates the force-balance constraint and that assumes random orientation of contacts, confirmed the tendency of two large forces on a grain to oppose each other, which leads to the formation of force chains in disordered materials. This model also provided direct insight into other issues, such as the role of friction, the effects of stress anisotropy, the difference between two-dimensional materials and three-dimensional materials. The numerical results obtained from the model are qualitatively consistent with earlier simulations and experiments. ...|$|E
40|$|For an {{incompressible}} and <b>frictionless</b> cylindrical <b>liquid</b> column the asymmetric {{natural frequencies}} are determined for the angular modes m= 1 and m> 1, abserving at the discs, between which the liquid bridge is located a 'sliding friction' boundary condition. In addition the response for translational and pitching excitation is treated. (orig.)
