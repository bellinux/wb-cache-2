After a visit by Tizard to GEC's Hirst Research Centre in Wembley in November 1939, and a follow-up visit by Watt, the company took up development and developed a working 25cm set using modified VT90s by the summer of 1940. With this success, Lovell and a new addition to the Airborne Group, Alan Lloyd Hodgkin, began experimenting with horn-type antennas that would offer significantly higher angular accuracy. Instead of broadcasting the radar signal across the entire forward hemisphere of the aircraft and listening to echoes from everywhere in that volume, this system would allow the radar to be used like a flashlight, pointed in the <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> This would greatly increase the amount of energy falling on a target, and improve detection capability.|$|E

50|$|The {{study of}} planar chiral {{metamaterials}} {{has revealed that}} planar chirality is associated with an optical effect: the directionally asymmetric transmission (reflection and absorption) of circularly polarized waves. Planar chiral metamaterials, which are also anisotropic and lossy exhibit different total transmission (reflection and absorption) levels for the same circularly polarized wave incident on their front and back.The asymmetric transmission phenomenon arises from different, e.g. left-to-right, circular polarization conversion efficiencies for opposite propagation <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> the incident wave and therefore the effect {{is referred to as}} circular conversion dichroism.Like the twist of a planar chiral pattern appears reversed for opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> planar chiral metamaterials have interchanged properties for left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves that are incident on their front and back. In particular left-handed and right-handed circularly polarized waves experience opposite directional transmission (reflection and absorption) asymmetries.|$|R
40|$|AbstractWhen {{observations}} can be {{made without}} noise, {{it is known that}} adaptive information is no more powerful than nonadaptive information for approximation of linear problems with Gaussian measure. When the noise is additive, independent of the true value, and normal, once again adaption does not help (Theorem 1 in Section 4). However, when those conditions are not satisfied, Examples 1 and 2 of Section 4 show that adaptive information can be much more powerful than nonadaptive information. Finally if orthogonal observations are used with the sample size as well as the number of repetitions fixed, and only the <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations</b> are chosen adaptively, then once again adaption does not help (Theorem 2 in Section 5). The issue is analogous to whether sequential designs are more powerful than fixed sample size designs in Bayesian statistics...|$|R
40|$|Reciprocity and {{scattering}} theorems for the normalized spherical scattering amplitude for {{elastic waves}} are {{obtained for the}} case of a rigid scatterer, a cavity and a penetrable scattering region. Depending on the polarization of the two incident waves reciprocity relations of the radial-radial, radial-angular, and angular-angular type are established. Radial and angular scattering theorems, expressing the corresponding scattering amplitudes via integrals of the amplitudes over all <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation,</b> as well as their special forms for scatterers with inversion symmetry are also provided. As a consequence of the stated scattering theorems the scattering cross-section for either a longitudinal, or a transverse incident wave is expressed through the forward value of the radial, or the angular amplitude, correspondingly. All the known relative theorems for acoustic scattering are trivially recovered from their elastic counterparts. © 1987 Birkhäuser Verlag...|$|R

40|$|Intrinsic 2 D {{chirality}} is {{a property}} of twisted planar objects like spirals {{and the letter}} "S", whose sense of twist is reversed for opposite <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> In 2006 {{it was discovered that}} 2 D chirality is associated with a fundamental electromagnetic effect, the directionally asymmetric transmission of circularly polarized waves. Here it will be demonstrated that the intriguing phenomenon of asymmetric transmission does not require intrinsically 2 D-chiral materials. Instead, extrinsic 2 D chirality, which can arise from oblique incidence onto ANY structured interface, is sufficient. Being dependent on the mutual orientation of metamaterial and incident beam, the asymmetric transmission effect is inherently tunable in this case and it can even be switched off. It will be shown that the tunable transmission asymmetry is necessarily accompanied by tunable directional asymmetries in reflection and absorption, opening up an opportunity to develop novel directionally asymmetric and polarization sensitive devices. Furthermore, an overview will be given over the underlying physics and fundamental limits of the directionally asymmetric phenomena...|$|R
30|$|Modification and {{enhancement}} of the fluorescence in photonic structures {{is important for}} development of optical sensors [1] and improvement of the fluorescence efficiency [2] and light harvesting ability in solar cells [3]. Most papers (see, for example, reviews [1, 4]) deal with experimental and theoretical aspects of the fluorophores embedded in the multilayered films forming one-dimensional (1 D) photonic crystals. The behavior of such structures {{is determined by the}} interference of light that leads to decreased reflectance and enhanced fluorescence at certain <b>directions</b> <b>of</b> <b>observation.</b> Fluorescence has increased intensity and higher degree of polarization at these angles, in comparison to the background emission. The increase of light intensity at certain directions may be explained by resonant coupling of fluorescence with the waveguiding leaky modes in the 1 D structure that can result in shorter fluorescent lifetimes and higher radiative rates [5, 6]. In particular, resonantly enhanced directional fluorescence with decreased lifetime was detected experimentally for a dye doped in 1 D photonic crystals [5] and explained in terms of increased density of states near the photonic bandgap. Directional emission of light has also been reported for the multilayered films doped with quantum dots [7] and rare-earth ions [8].|$|R

40|$|The {{real-time}} {{treatment of}} interactive realistically varying aerosol {{in a global}} operational forecasting system, as opposed to prescribed (fixed or climatologically varying) aerosols, {{is a very difficult}} challenge that only recently begins to be addressed. Experiment results from a recent version of the NASA GEOS- 5 forecasting system, inclusive of interactive aerosol treatment, are presented in this work. Four sets of 30 5 -day forecasts are initialized from a high quality set of analyses previously produced and documented to cover the period from 15 August to 16 September 2006, which corresponds to the NASA African Monsoon Multidisciplinary Analysis (NAMMA) observing campaign. The four forecast sets are at two different horizontal resolutions and with and without interactive aerosol treatment.

40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{efficiency}} of Monte Carlo methods in solving continuum radiative transfer problems. The sampling of the radiation field and convergence of dust temperature calculations {{in the case of}} optically thick clouds are both studied. For spherically symmetric clouds we find that the computational cost of Monte Carlo simulations can be reduced, in some cases by orders of magnitude, with simple importance weighting schemes. This is particularly true for models consisting of cells of different sizes for which the run times would otherwise be determined {{by the size of the}} smallest cell. We present a new idea of extending importance weighting to scattered photons. This is found to be useful in calculations of scattered flux and could be important for three-dimensional models when observed intensity is needed only for one general <b>direction</b> <b>of</b> <b>observations.</b> Convergence <b>of</b> dust temperature calculations is studied for models with optical depths 10 - 10000. We examine acceleration methods where radiative interactions inside a cell or between neighbouring cells are treated explicitly. In optically thick clouds with strong self-coupling between dust temperatures the run times can be reduced by more than one order of magnitude. The use of a reference field was also examined. This eliminates the need for repeating simulation of constant sources (e. g., background radiation) after the first iteration and significantly reduces sampling errors. The applicability of the methods for three-dimensional models is discussed. Comment: submitted to A&A, 19 page...|$|R
