2500|$|Carlo Santos, in {{reviewing}} the manga volumes, found the antagonist monster designs to interest him the most, and wished Ikeda would have focused the story on action-fantasy themed manga. He called antagonist Hokuto Kaneshiro a [...] "dead ringer for Light Yagami from Death Note" [...] and smarter than the usual monsters of the week, but the storyline he is placed in is predictable. Although he liked that Hokuto had a [...] "shocking truth....that {{could have been a}} game-changer for the series", he was disappointed in Ikeda's resolution to the story: [...] "Hokuto has an arbitrary, unconvincing change of heart, school life is reset to the way it was, and the villain walks off as if nothing happened." [...] He found the canned phrases of the girls fighting in some of the comedy chapters to be entertaining, including Kyoko's gold mine of one-liners. HÃ¸gset found the bat to be really obnoxious with its spouting useless trivia, repeating what happens to Moka, and things that bring the story to a grinding halt or [...] "make you want to bludgeon your brain out of your cranium with something made of metal." [...] Serdar Yegulalp of About.com also agrees about the bat bringing the action to <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b> He found the character introductions repetitive, and wished they would deviate from the harem formula and develop into lively, sympathetic ones like with Ouran High School Host Club.|$|E
2500|$|Overall, No More Heroes {{received}} positive reviews. The game {{received a}} 34/40 from Famitsu. GameSpot gave it an Editor's Choice Award, praising the unique story, gameplay, {{and sense of}} humor. X-Play gave the game 5/5, citing [...] "exceptional writing, sharp satire, satisfying game progression, unique visual style, intuitive controls, and a catchy and distinctive soundtrack. Xplay also called it the third best game and best Wii game released {{in the first half}} of 2008". Cheat Code Central called the game [...] "a must-buy blast that out-shines all other third-party Wii titles to date." [...] The praise continued with notable gaming critic Ben [...] "Yahtzee" [...] Croshaw, as he mentioned that he enjoyed the game for its satire, quirky aesthetic, and unpredictable story, despite the repetition and restrictive overworld. GamePro magazine also praised No More Heroes with a Game of the Month Award and Editor's Choice award, saying [...] "The entries for the best new character of 2008 are closed here's your winner (Travis Touchdown)" [...] and that the game [...] "easily ranks among the Wii's finest titles." [...] GameTrailers, although reviewing the game positively, found its open world to be somewhat limited, an assessment shared by IGN, who went even further, claiming it ground an otherwise exciting game to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b> [...] Despite awarding the game a less positive review than others, IGN awarded it [...] "Game of the Month" [...] for January, calling it a [...] "must-play" [...] despite its flaws. Game Informer gave it one of the lowest scores, stating that [...] "the repetition and lack of substance behind the flash" [...] was among the many problems they had with the game. Nintendo Power gave it an 8/10 stating that [...] "No More Heroes's zany charm and zest for excess go a long way to make up for its weaknesses." [...] They also listed it as the 7th best Wii game to date. No More Heroes won multiple Wii-specific awards from IGN in their 2008 video game awards, including Best Story and Best Action Game. It was also a nominee for several other Wii-specific IGN awards, including Best Artistic Design, Best Voice Acting, and Best New IP. GameSpot awards this game for 2008 for its original IP and platform award. Daniel Wilks of Hyper commended the game for its [...] "very clever writing and great combat mechanics". However, he criticised it for being [...] "deliberately repetitive".' ...|$|E
60|$|He {{began to}} walk home, turning over his discoveries in his thoughts, when he {{suddenly}} came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b>|$|E
60|$|The {{instinct}} of self-preservation caused both {{to come to}} a <b>dead</b> {{and violent}} <b>halt</b> when within six yards of the meeting-point. A happy thought burst upon Angus at that instant.|$|R
5000|$|On November 12, 2015, Geoff and Richard Keene jointly posted [...] "The Final Word", citing an {{inability}} to continue financing the game's development. Development of The <b>Dead</b> Linger was <b>halted</b> at this time.|$|R
50|$|Halt and Horace, {{still on}} their rescue mission, find a border outpost {{of which a}} dozen Skandians lay <b>dead,</b> shot. <b>Halt</b> manages to {{recognise}} an arrow, shot by the Temujai and becomes instantly worried. Two decades ago, the Temujai had nearly conquered the world, but with politics and a dish of bad shellfish, the invasion was stopped. Halt and Horace, after managing to track the Temujai down, came to Will's aid and they rescue Cassandra.|$|R
60|$|The horrible {{noise and}} the dreadful {{slaughter}} in their ranks, seemed {{to render the}} affrighted creatures incapable of action, for {{they came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b>|$|E
60|$|The whole party {{came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> on this {{unexpected}} caution, and each cocked his piece as they looked, first into the gloom beyond, and then at each other, in surprise and perplexity.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I {{came to see}} if {{you would}} go to the-- er-- to the-- er----" [...] stammered William Philander, and then he came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b> [...] "Oh, my tooth!" [...] he gasped, suddenly.|$|E
6000|$|A clasp of {{the hands}} in congratulation, {{and then they were}} {{starting}} to return, when they heard a dull tramp, and the head of a dark column came along just ahead of them. The boys shrank back under the guns, and lay flat among the bodies of the <b>dead.</b> The column <b>halted</b> at the guns, and a voice asked: ...|$|R
60|$|This tongue, {{which was}} some four hundred yards in depth, even at its root or widest part was {{not more than}} six hundred and fifty paces across, while at its tip it {{scarcely}} measured ninety. The Greys, who, in passing {{down the side of}} the hill and on to the tip of the tongue, had formed into a column, on reaching the spot where it broadened out again, reassumed their triple-line formation, and <b>halted</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|R
2500|$|At 18:43, however, three [...] "Jills" [...] roared in low {{from the}} east, torpedoes slung menacingly beneath their bellies. Willmarths guns {{opened fire on}} two just before they {{released}} their [...] "fish." [...] One torpedo holed Ashtabula and forced her to a <b>halt,</b> <b>dead</b> in the water. While the oiler's repair parties controlled the flooding and patched the hole, the convoy passed out of Leyte Gulf and reformed {{in the wake of}} the attack. Eventually, Ashtabula, repairs effected, rejoined at 22:30.|$|R
6000|$|Under {{this new}} impulse he hurried forward again, jostling people as he went, and {{receiving}} {{a good deal}} of rough-handling in return. Presently he came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> and with knitted brows and set teeth, hissed, [...] "I'll go and drown myself." ...|$|E
60|$|And suddenly, not {{ten yards}} farther, we beheld them stop. A low cry arose. Silver doubled his pace, digging {{away with the}} foot of his crutch like one possessed; and next moment he and I had come also to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt.</b>|$|E
60|$|Thus commanded, {{the mare}} moved forward once more, {{but this time}} much slower. Once or twice her feet seemed to stick fast, but Pawnee Brown did not notice this. At last she came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> and would not go another step.|$|E
6000|$|As Nobs and I {{approached}} the recumbent figure {{farther up the}} beach, I was appraised by my nose that whether or not, the thing had once been organic and alive, but that for some time it had been <b>dead.</b> Nobs <b>halted,</b> sniffed and growled. A little later he sat down upon his haunches, raised his muzzle to the heavens and bayed forth a most dismal howl. I shied a small stone at him and bade him shut up--his uncanny noise made me nervous. When I had come quite close to the thing, I still could not say whether it had been man or beast. The carcass was badly swollen and partly decomposed. There {{was no sign of}} clothing upon or about it. A fine, brownish hair covered the chest and abdomen, and the face, the palms of the hands, the feet, the shoulders and back were practically hairless. The creature must have been about the height of a fair sized man; its features were similar to those of a man; yet had it been a man? ...|$|R
60|$|Jeekie {{stepped forward}} and asked a {{question}} of the guards, to which they replied with a derisive shout. Then without a word of warning he lifted Aylward's express rifle which he carried, and fired first one barrel and then the other, shooting the two leading soldiers <b>dead.</b> Their companions <b>halted</b> amazed, but before they could lift their guns, Jeekie and those with him rushed at them and began stabbing them with spears and striking them with sticks. In three minutes it was over without another shot being fired. Most of them were despatched, and the others, throwing down their guns, had fled wounded into the forest.|$|R
6000|$|To-day I {{am in the}} Yellowstone Park, and I wish I were <b>dead.</b> The train <b>halted</b> at Cinnabar station, and we were decanted, a howling {{crowd of}} us, into stages, {{variously}} horsed, for the eight-mile drive to the first spectacle of the Park--a place called the Mammoth Hot Springs. [...] "What means this eager, anxious throng?" [...] I asked the driver. [...] "You've struck one of Rayment's excursion parties--that's all--a crowd of creator-condemned fools mostly. Aren't you one of 'em?" [...] "No," [...] I said. [...] "May I sit up here with you, great chief and man with a golden tongue? I do not know Mister Rayment. I belong to T. Cook and Son." [...] The other person, from {{the quality of the}} material he handles, must be the son of a sea-cook. He collects masses of Down-Easters from the New England States and elsewhere and hurls them across the Continent and into the Yellowstone Park on tour. A brake-load of Cook's Continental tourists trapezing through Paris (I've seen 'em) are angels of light compared to the Rayment trippers. It is not the ghastly vulgarity, the oozing, rampant Bessemer-steel self-sufficiency and ignorance of the men that revolts me, so much as the display of these same qualities in the women-folk. I saw a new type in the coach, and all my dreams of a better and more perfect East died away. [...] "Are these--um--persons here any sort of persons in their own places?" [...] I asked a shepherd who appeared to be herding them.|$|R
60|$|A loud summons at {{the door}} of the {{building}} created a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> in the uproar, and the dragoons instinctively caught up their arms, to be prepared for the worst. The door was opened, and the Skinners entered, dragging in the peddler, bending beneath the load of his pack.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Van Astrachan made a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> at {{the idea}} of Dick Follingsbee. He never would receive that man under his roof, he said, and he never would enter his house; and when Mr. Van Astrachan once said a thing of this kind, as Mr. Hosea Biglow remarks, [...] "a meeting-house wasn't sotter." ...|$|E
60|$|Upon {{starting}} with the loaded barrel, for a few paces we got along pretty well, and were constrained to think the idea not a bad one. But we did not long think so. In {{less than five minutes}} we came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> the springing and buckling of the clumsy oar being almost unendurable.|$|E
6000|$|Mr. Losberne {{thrust his}} hands into his pockets, and took several turns up and down the room; often stopping, and {{balancing}} himself on his toes, and frowning frightfully. After various exclamations of 'I've got it now' and 'no, I haven't,' and as many renewals of the walking and frowning, he at length made a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> and spoke as follows: ...|$|E
60|$|The Indian, however, {{proved that}} Rance was wrong by {{suddenly}} {{coming to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> and dropping the last morsel {{he was in the}} act of raising to his mouth. He then heaved a deep sigh and looked round on the whole party with a radiant smile, which was literally sparkling by reason of the firelight which glittered on his greasy countenance.|$|E
60|$|Several {{men were}} {{entering}} {{the room where}} Barney stood before the general and his staff. A glance revealed to the prisoner that Peter of Blentz had come, and with him Von Coblich and Maenck. At the same instant Peter's eyes met Barney's, and the former, white and wide-eyed came almost to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> grasping hurriedly at the arm of Maenck who walked beside him.|$|E
60|$|We {{may have}} {{proceeded}} {{two miles from}} the spot where we had buried Sam, the hunter, when on rising a little hillock, the Indian tossed his arm, the sign that a new discovery was made. This time, however, the gesture was rather made in exultation than in horror. As he came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> at the same instant, we all closed eagerly up, and got an early view of the cause of this exhibition of feeling.|$|E
60|$|A man {{pursued by}} a lion, was about {{stepping}} into a place of safety, when he bethought him {{of the power of}} the human eye; and, turning about, he fixed upon his pursuer a steady look of stern reproof. The raging beast immediately moderated his rate per hour, and finally came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> within a yard of the man's nose. After making a leisurely survey of him, he extended his neck and bit off a small section of his victim's thigh.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look, you," [...] {{coming to}} a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> and scowling upon him. [...] "Look, you," [...] {{swelling}} his bulk out before him like a swaying balloon, [...] "look, you, you on others' behalf ask for money; you, a fellow with a face {{as long as my}} arm. Hark ye, now: {{there is such a thing}} as gravity, and in condemned felons it may be genuine; but of long faces there are three sorts; that of grief's drudge, that of the lantern-jawed man, and that of the impostor. You know best which yours is." ...|$|E
6000|$|And here, too, is a {{somewhat}} similar thing. A steamboat is casting {{loose from the}} wharf. A traveller, portmanteau in hand, is discovered running toward the wharf, at full speed. Suddenly, he makes a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> stoops, and picks up something from {{the ground in a}} very agitated manner. It is a pocket-book, and--"Has any gentleman lost a pocketbook?" [...] he cries. No one can say that he has exactly lost a pocket-book; but a great excitement ensues, when the treasure trove is found to be of value. The boat, however, must not be detained.|$|E
60|$|At {{the last}} moment, when {{face to face}} with the public, young Douglass lost courage. The stake for which he played was so great! Like a man who has put his last dollar upon the hazard, he was ready to snatch his gold from the boards. The whole thing seemed weakly tenuous at dress-rehearsal, and Royleston, half-drunk as usual, {{persistently}} bungled his lines. The children in the second act squeaked like nervous poll-parrots, and even Helen's sunny brow was darkened by a frown as her leading man stumbled along to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> again and again.|$|E
60|$|At last Madeline {{was brought}} to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> by Stewart and his horse {{blocking}} the trail. Looking up, she saw {{they were at the}} head of a canyon that yawned beneath and widened its gray-walled, green-patched slopes down to a black forest of fir. The drab monotony of the foothills made contrast below the forest, and away in the distance, rosy and smoky, lay the desert. Retracting her gaze, Madeline saw pack-horses cross an open space a mile below, and she thought she saw the stag-hounds. Stewart's dark eyes searched the slopes high up along the craggy escarpments. Then he put the black to the descent.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, my dear friend. No, no, Mr. George. No, no, no, sir," [...] remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed, cunningly {{rubbing his}} spare legs. [...] "Not quite a <b>dead</b> <b>halt,</b> I think. He has good friends, {{and he is}} good for his pay, and he {{is good for the}} selling price of his commission, and he is good for his chance in a lawsuit, and he is good for his chance in a wife, and--oh, do you know, Mr. George, I think my friend would {{consider}} the young gentleman good for something yet?" [...] says Grandfather Smallweed, turning up his velvet cap and scratching his ear like a monkey.|$|E
6000|$|... "So {{much the}} better," [...] he jeered back. [...] "Look you," [...] he added, {{coming to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> where he was; [...] "look you, I have been called a Canada thistle. Very good. And a seedy one: still better. And the seedy Canada thistle has been pretty well shaken among ye: best of all. Dare say some seed has been shaken out; and won't it spring though? And when it does spring, do you cut down the young thistles, and won't they spring the more? It's {{encouraging}} and coaxing 'em. Now, when with my thistles your farms shall be well stocked, why then--you may abandon 'em!" ...|$|E
60|$|The {{speed at}} which we traveled, however, fast as it was, availed not {{to keep up with}} the pack. In a short half mile, just as the hollow sloped and merged into level ground, they left us behind and {{disappeared}} so quickly as almost to frighten me. My mustang plunged out of the forest to the rim and dashed along, apparently unmindful of the chasm. The red and yellow surface blurred in a blinding glare. I heard the chorus of hounds, but as its direction baffled me I trusted to my horse and I did well, for soon he came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> on the rim.|$|E
60|$|As {{the guests}} grew thinner, Lieutenant Rich strolled {{for a moment}} out of the drawing-room into the hall in quest of fresher air. But he had no sooner passed the {{threshold}} of the ante-chamber than he was brought to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> by a discovery of the most surprising nature. The flowering shrubs had disappeared from the staircase; three large furniture waggons stood before the garden gate; the servants were busy dismantling the house upon all sides; and some of them had already donned their great-coats and were preparing to depart. It was like the end of a country ball, where everything has been supplied by contract. Brackenbury had indeed some matter for reflection. First, the guests, who were no real guests after all, had been dismissed; and now the servants, who could hardly be genuine servants, were actively dispersing.|$|E
60|$|Instead of {{any longer}} {{throwing}} away the precious moments, in fruitless endeavours to induce his foe {{to cross the}} stream, the young partisan of the Pawnees led his troops, at a swift gallop, along its margin, in quest of some favourable spot, where by a sudden push he might throw his own band without loss to the opposite shore. The instant his object was discovered, each mounted Teton received a footman behind him, and Mahtoree was still enabled to concentrate his whole force against the effort. Perceiving that his design was anticipated, and unwilling to blow his horses by a race that would disqualify them for service, even after they had succeeded in outstripping the more heavily-burdened cattle of the Siouxes, Hard-Heart drew up, {{and came to a}} <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> on the very margin of the water-course.|$|E
6000|$|... "At 11 P.M. {{it began}} to snow hard. Shortly after leaving the small village of Welden, we entered upon that {{tremendous}} prairie solitude that stretches its leagues on leagues of houseless dreariness far away toward the Jubilee Settlements. The winds, unobstructed by trees or hills, or even vagrant rocks, whistled fiercely across the level desert, driving the falling snow before it like spray from the crested waves of a stormy sea. The snow was deepening fast; and we knew, by the diminished speed of the train, that the engine was plowing through it with steadily increasing difficulty. Indeed, it almost came to a <b>dead</b> <b>halt</b> sometimes, {{in the midst of}} great drifts that piled themselves like colossal graves across the track. Conversation began to flag. Cheerfulness gave place to grave concern. The possibility of being imprisoned in the snow, on the bleak prairie, fifty miles from any house, presented itself to every mind, and extended its depressing influence over every spirit.|$|E
