5|$|Anonymous {{first became}} {{associated}} with <b>hacktivism</b> in 2008 following {{a series of}} actions against the Church of Scientology known as Project Chanology. On January 15, 2008, the gossip blog Gawker posted a video in which celebrity Scientologist Tom Cruise praised the religion; and the Church responded with a cease-and-desist letter for violation of copyright. 4chan users organized a raid against the Church in retaliation, prank-calling its hotline, sending black faxes designed to waste ink cartridges, and launching DDoS attacks against its websites.|$|E

The original soundtrack for Watch Dogs 2 was composed by Hudson Mohawke.|$|E
25|$|Tor enables {{its users}} to surf the Internet, chat and send instant {{messages}} anonymously, {{and is used}} by {{a wide variety of}} people for both licit and illicit purposes. Tor has, for example, been used by criminal enterprises, <b>hacktivism</b> groups, and law enforcement agencies at cross purposes, sometimes simultaneously; likewise, agencies within the U.S. government variously fund Tor (the U.S. State Department, the National Science Foundation, and – through the Broadcasting Board of Governors, which itself partially funded Tor until October 2012 – Radio Free Asia) and seek to subvert it.|$|E
40|$|As {{global society}} {{becomes more and}} more dependent, {{politically}} and economically on the flow of information, the power of those who can disrupt and manipulate that flow also increases. This text provides a detailed history of <b>hacktivism's</b> evolution from early hacking culture to its present day status as the radical face of online politics...|$|R
500|$|In {{its early}} form, {{the concept was}} adopted by a {{decentralized}} online community acting anonymously in a coordinated manner, usually toward a loosely self-agreed goal, and primarily focused on entertainment, or [...] {{often referred to as}} [...] "lulz". Beginning with 2008's Project Chanology—a series of protests, pranks, and hacks targeting the Church of Scientology—the Anonymous collective became increasingly associated with collaborative <b>hacktivism</b> {{on a number of issues}} internationally. Individuals claiming to align themselves with Anonymous undertook protests and other actions (including direct action) in retaliation against copyright-focused campaigns by motion picture and recording industry trade associations. Later targets of Anonymous <b>hacktivism</b> included government agencies of the U.S., Israel, Tunisia, Uganda, and others; the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant; child pornography sites; copyright protection agencies; the Westboro Baptist Church; and corporations such as PayPal, MasterCard, Visa, and Sony. Anons have publicly supported WikiLeaks and the Occupy movement. Related groups LulzSec and Operation AntiSec carried out cyberattacks on U.S. government agencies, media, video game companies, military contractors, military personnel, and police officers, resulting in the attention of law enforcement to the groups' activities. [...] Some actions by members of the group have been described as being anti-Zionist. It has threatened to cyber-attack Israel and engaged in the [...] "#OpIsrael" [...] cyber-attacks of Israeli websites on Yom HaShoah (Holocaust Remembrance Day) in 2013.|$|E
50|$|Across these definitions, {{they all}} share {{the view that}} {{cyberterrorism}} is politically and/or ideologically inclined.  One area of debate {{is the difference between}} cyberterrorism and <b>hacktivism.</b> <b>Hacktivism</b> is,” the marriage of hacking with political activism”. Both items are politically driven, and involve using computers, however cyberterrorism is primarily used to cause harm. It becomes an issue because acts of violence on the computer can be labeled either cyberterrorism or <b>hacktivism.</b>|$|E
50|$|The term {{electronic}} {{civil disobedience}} and <b>hacktivism</b> {{may be used}} synonymously, although some commentators maintain that {{the difference is that}} ECD actors don’t hide their names, while most hacktivists wish to remain anonymous.

It is also maintained that <b>hacktivism</b> is done by individuals rather than by specific groups. In reality the distinction between ECD and <b>hacktivism</b> is not clear.|$|E
