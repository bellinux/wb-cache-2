40|$|An {{apparatus}} for degassing {{a liquid}} comprises a containment vessel a liquid pump and a <b>header</b> <b>assembly</b> (12) within the containment vessel in a volume above the reservoir of the liquid. The pump draws from this reservoir and outputs to the <b>header</b> <b>assembly,</b> {{the latter being}} constructed to return the liquid to the reservoir {{in the form of}} a number of stacked, vertically spaced, concentric, conical cascades via orifices. A vacuum source provides a partial vacuum in the containment vessel to enhance the degassing process...|$|E

40|$|Based on a {{theoretical}} analysis of convective heat transfer across large internal surface areas, this paper discusses the design implications for generating lightweight gas-gas heat exchanger designs by packaging such areas into compact three-dimensional shapes. Allowances {{are made for}} hot and cold inlet and outlet <b>headers</b> for <b>assembly</b> of completed regenerator (or recuperator) heat exchanger units into closed cycle gas turbine flow ducting. Surface area and resulting volume and mass requirements are computed {{for a range of}} heat exchanger effectiveness values and internal heat transfer coefficients. Benefit cost curves show the effect of increasing heat exchanger effectiveness on Brayton cycle thermodynamic efficiency on the plus side, while also illustrating the cost in heat exchanger required surface area, volume, and mass requirements as effectiveness is increased. The equations derived for counterflow and crossflow configurations show that as effectiveness values approach unity, or 100 percent, the required surface area, and hence heat exchanger volume and mass tend toward infinity, since the implication is that heat is transferred at a zero temperature difference. To verify the dimensional accuracy of the regenerator mass computational procedure, calculation of a regenerator specific mass, that is, heat exchanger weight per unit working fluid mass flow, is performed in both English and SI units. Identical numerical values for the specific mass parameter, whether expressed in lb/(lb/sec) or kg/ (kg/sec), show the dimensional consistency of overall results...|$|R
50|$|Most ICEs {{consist of}} an adaptor unit that sits between the ICE host {{computer}} and the system to be tested. A pin <b>header</b> and cable <b>assembly</b> connects the adaptor to a socket where the actual central processing unit (CPU) or microcontroller mounts within the embedded system. Recent ICEs enable programmers to access the on-chip debug circuit that is integrated into the CPU via JTAG or background debug mode interface (BDM) to debug the software of an embedded system. These systems often use a standard version of the CPU chip, and can simply attach to a debug port on a production system. They are sometimes called in-circuit debuggers or ICDs, to distinguish {{the fact that they}} do not replicate the functionality of the CPU, but instead control an already existing, standard CPU. Since the CPU need not be replaced, they can operate on production units where the CPU is soldered in and cannot be replaced. On x86 Pentiums, a special 'probe mode' is used by ICEs to aid in debugging.|$|R
40|$|An ion-exchange {{hollow fiber}} is {{prepared}} by introducing {{into the wall}} of the fiber polymerizable liquid monomers, and polymerizing the monomers therein to form solid, insoluble, crosslinked, ion-exchange resin particles which embed in {{the wall of the}} fiber. Excess particles blocking the central passage or bore of the fiber are removed by forcing liquid through the fiber. The fibers have high ion-exchange capacity, a practical wall permeability and good mechanical strength even with very thin wall dimensions. Experimental investigation of bundles of ion-exchange hollow fibers attached to a <b>header</b> <b>assembly</b> have shown the fiber to be very efficient in removing counterions from solution...|$|E

40|$|The {{mechanical}} {{cycling test}} {{was required to}} verify {{the integrity of the}} welded joints and the thin wall tube bends in the primary loop manifold assembly of a four pack thermo electric module and to help establish structural and mechanical requirements of any possible redesign. The test section was subjected to more severe loading conditions than will be experienced during actual operating conditions. The test was a mechanical simulation of the differential thermal expansion which occurs due to the approximately 600 {degrees} F temperature differential in the subassembly. The actual load exerted on the test section represented this deflection. The effects on the joints and tube material were observed. The test was conducted on a test segment of manifold designed to duplicate two of the flexible elbows; the transition joints between the elbows and the tubular module inner clad; and the welded joints of the elbows to the primary loop header. The assembled test segment and hold-down bracket are shown. The bracket was mounted {{to the base of the}} Universal Test Machine. Dial indicators measured the relative displacement between the line of applied load (through the vertical axis of the primary loop header) and the attachment point at the holddown bracket. In the first test, the load was applied in fifty pound increments until the relative displacement of nine mils was measured between the loop header and the welded joint on the feedline elbow. The remaining tests were cycling the <b>header</b> <b>assembly</b> at increasing relative displace ment. The summary of these tests are tabulated. The testing had no noticeable affect on the structural integrity of the weldment...|$|E
