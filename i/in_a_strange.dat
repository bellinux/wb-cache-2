5|$|Along with cargo {{the company}} also took passengers, and an article by Henry Lawson, {{published}} in The Bulletin in 1910 and titled 'Bermagui - <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> Sunset', describes a steamer journey from Bermagui to Sydney – in all likelihood Lawson was traveling with the company. Unfortunately, in 1928 one of the company's vessels, the Merimbula, ran ashore on Beecroft Head while heading south. After this wreck, passenger shipping to the south coast finished, and the company focused entirely upon cargo.|$|E
5|$|Another {{reform was}} that Austria, having lost many officers, veteran and elite troops, and regulars, {{and unable to}} call on allies, embraced the Levée en masse used earlier by the French. By this time, the French were moving from the Levée en masse in favour of forming a regular army based on a core of battle-hardened and elite veterans. <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> {{reversal}} of the earlier Napoleonic Wars, where Frenchmen with little experience and often pressed into service fought against the professional Austrian army, a massive amount of Austrian conscripts, with no experience and only basic training and equipment would be sent into the field against a highly trained, campaign-hardened, and well-equipped French Grande Armée.|$|E
5|$|He {{was dressed}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> way. A šajkača was {{pulled to the}} front of his head and almost {{completely}} covered his forehead. His eyebrows were hardly visible. Under its weight, the ears seemed to have collapsed. He wore a kind of long, black coat, covered in mud and held in place by a string. He used another piece of string for a belt, and from it hung a pot for boiling water, a tea strainer, a canteen, and other useful things. He walked slightly bent forward, followed everywhere by the noise of the things clashing at his waist.|$|E

5|$|In flashback, Dales tells Mulder about {{first meeting}} Exley in 1947. Dales (portrayed {{as a young}} man by Frederic Lane), a member of the Roswell Police Department, has been {{assigned}} to protect a hesitant Exley. Dales travels with Exley and his teammates on their bus, and one night sees that the sleeping Exley is reflected in a window as an alien. The next day, during a game, Exley is hit by a pitch and starts making utterances <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> language before returning to his senses. Afterwards, Dales notices that a mysterious green ooze appeared where Exley's bleeding head had rested.|$|E
5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner {{which has been}} caught <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> cloud belt. They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E

5|$|The wolves {{are kept}} in a human {{facility}} {{for a couple of}} months to be examined, and a wound on Oldtooth's paw is treated. In early winter, the wolves are sedated again and awaken to find themselves <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> high place with radio collars around their necks. Still groggy from the tranquilizer, the strangeness of the events and the smell of grizzly bear in the area triggers Marta's flight instincts and she runs blindly downward, leaving Oldtooth and the cubs behind. When Oldtooth awakens, he quietly abandons Annie and Sula, following Marta's trail, but at a much slower pace.|$|E
5|$|Dennis Showalter, {{writing in}} 1975, defended Starship Troopers, {{stating that the}} society {{depicted}} in it did not contain many elements of fascism. He argues that the novel does not include outright opposition to bolshevism and liberalism that would be expected in a fascist society. Others have responded by saying Showalter's argument {{is based on a}} literal reading of the novel, and that the story glorifies militarism to a large extent. Ken Macleod argues that the book does not actually advocate fascism because anybody capable of understanding the oath of Federal Service is able to enlist and thereby obtain political power. Macleod states that Heinlein's books are consistently liberal, but cover a spectrum from democratic to elitist forms of liberalism, Starship Troopers being on the latter end of the spectrum. It has been argued that Heinlein's militarism is more libertarian than fascist, and that this trend is also present in Heinlein's other popular books of the period, such as Stranger <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Strange</b> Land (1961) and The Moon is a Harsh Mistress (1966). This period of Heinlein's writing has received more critical attention than any other, though he continued to write into the 1980s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the present}} day, Tintin, his dog Snowy, {{and his friends}} Captain Haddock and Professor Calculus follow {{coordinates}} that Sir Francis had left his three sons <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> riddle hidden in three model ships of the Unicorn. Reaching the coordinates, they discover the island and, upon diving, they find {{the wreck of the}} Unicorn. Although they recover various artefacts from it, they do not find the treasure. Back in Belgium, Tintin realises that Sir Francis' message referred, not to the location of the Unicorn, but to a globe mounted on a statue in Sir Francis' former country home. Understanding now that Francis would never have left the treasure but would have taken it with him to his home, Tintin locates the coordinates to the treasure on the globe, presses a secret button he finds there, and discovers Red Rackham's treasure hidden inside.|$|E

5|$|Oshii based {{the setting}} for Ghost in the Shell on Hong Kong. Oshii commented that his first thought to find {{an image of the}} future setting was an Asian city, but finding a {{suitable}} cityscape of the future would be impossible. Oshii chose to use the real streets of Hong Kong as his model. He also said that Hong Kong was the perfect subject and theme for the film with its countless signs and the cacophony of sounds. The film's mecha designer Takeuchi Atsushi noted that while the film does not have a chosen setting, it is obviously based on Hong Kong because the city represented the theme of the film, {{the old and the new}} which exist <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> relationship in an age of an information deluge. Before shooting the film, the artists drew sketches that emphasized Hong Kong's chaotic, confusing and overwhelming aspects.|$|E
5|$|The term {{attachment}} {{disorder is}} used to describe emotional and behavioral problems of young children, and also applied to school-age children, teenagers and adults. The specific difficulties implied depend on {{the age of the}} individual being assessed, and a child's attachment-related behaviors may be very different with one familiar adult than with another, suggesting that the disorder is within the relationship and interactions of the two people rather than an aspect of one or the other personality. No list of symptoms can legitimately be presented but generally the term attachment disorder refers to the absence or distortion of age appropriate social behaviors with adults. For example, in a toddler, attachment-disordered behavior could include a failure to stay near familiar adults <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> environment or to be comforted by contact with a familiar person, whereas in a six-year-old attachment-disordered behavior might involve excessive friendliness and inappropriate approaches to strangers.|$|E
5|$|The Breves causae and Argumenta {{belong to}} a pre-Vulgate {{tradition}} of manuscripts. The Breves causae are summaries of the Old Latin translations of the Gospels and are divided into numbered chapters. These chapter numbers, like the numbers for the canon tables, are not used on the text pages of the Gospels. It is unlikely that these numbers would have been used, even if the manuscript had been completed, because the chapter numbers corresponded to old Latin translations {{and would have been}} difficult to harmonise with the Vulgate text. The Argumenta are collections of legends about the Evangelists. The Breves causae and Argumenta are arranged <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>strange</b> order: first come the Breves causae and Argumenta for Matthew, followed by the Breves and Argumenta for Mark, then, quite oddly, come the Argumenta of both Luke and John, followed by their Breves causae. This anomalous order mirrors that found in the Book of Durrow, although in the latter instance, the misplaced sections appear {{at the very end of}} the manuscript rather than as part of a continuous preliminary. In other insular manuscripts, such as the Lindisfarne Gospels, the Book of Armagh, and the Echternach Gospels, each Gospel is treated as a separate work and has its preliminaries immediately preceding it. The slavish repetition in Kells of the order of the Breves causae and Argumenta found in Durrow led scholar T. K. Abbott to the conclusion that the scribe of Kells had either the Book of Durrow or a common model in hand.|$|E
