It is most reliably diagnosed by the measurement of the blood ethylene glycol concentration. Ethylene glycol in biological fluids can be determined by gas chromatography. Many hospital laboratories do not have the ability to perform this blood test {{and in the absence of}} this test the diagnosis must be made based on {{the clinical}} presentation of the patient. In this situation a helpful test to diagnose poisoning is the measurement of the osmolal gap. The patients' serum osmolality is measured by <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> <b>depression</b> and then compared with the predicted osmolality based on the patients' measured sodium, glucose, blood urea nitrogen, and any ethanol that may have been ingested. The presence of a large osmolal gap supports a diagnosis of ethylene glycol poisoning. However, a normal osmolar gap does not rule out ethylene glycol exposure because of wide individual variability.|$|E
25|$|Ice {{cream is}} a {{colloidal}} emulsion having dispersed phase as fat globules. It is an emulsion {{which is in}} the end made into foam by incorporating air cells which is frozen to form dispersed ice cells. In the composition of ice cream ice crystals are of most importance as they give a desirable mouth feel. Ice cream is composed of water, ice, milk fat, milk protein, sugar and air. Water and fat have highest proportions by weight creating an emulsion. The triacylglycerols in far are non polar and will adhere to itself by van der Waals interactions. Water is polar thus, emulsifiers are needed for dispersion of fat. Also ice cream has a colloidal phase of foam which helps in light texture. Milk proteins such as casein and whey protein present in ice cream are amphiphilic, can adsorb water and form micelles which will contribute to consistency. Sucrose which is disaccharide is usually used as a sweetening agent. Lactose which is sugar present in milk will cause <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> <b>depression.</b> Thus, on freezing some water will be unfrozen and will not give hard texture.|$|E

2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of glass research it was most important to know {{the relation between the}} glass composition and its properties. For this purpose Otto Schott introduced the additivity principle in several publications for calculation of glass properties. This principle implies that the relation between the glass composition and a specific property is linear to all glass component concentrations, assuming an ideal mixture, with Ci and bi representing specific glass component concentrations and related coefficients respectively in the equation below. The additivity principle is a simplification and only valid within narrow composition ranges as seen in the displayed diagrams for the refractive index and the viscosity. Nevertheless, the application of the additivity principle lead the way to many of Schott’s inventions, including optical glasses, glasses with low thermal expansion for cooking and laboratory ware (Duran), and glasses with reduced <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> <b>depression</b> for mercury thermometers.

40|$|The Summitville high-sulfidation {{gold deposit}} is hosted by a {{volcanic}} dome {{consisting of the}} South Mountain Quartz Latite that was erupted 23 Ma ago during formation of the Platoro Caldera complex in the San Juan volcanic field of south central Colorado. Alteration and mineralization developed during or shortly after dome emplacement {{as a result of}} metal-rich magmatic fluids and vapor emanating from a crystallizing intrusion at depth. Copper, arsenic, silver and gold are enriched in the deposit with two of the last paragenetic stages, the barite-base metal sulfide and goethite stages, containing the highest gold grades. Barite contains magmatic sulfur with a range of δ 34 S values (19. 3 – 31. 8 ‰) that reflects SO 42 – – H 2 S isotopic equilibration over a temperature range of 115 to 180 °C, which is consistent a calculated temperature of 147 °C based on the sulfur isotopic fractionation between intergrown barite and galena. Barite δ 18 O values (19. 3 – 31. 8 ‰) indicate the barite fluids contained a minor component of meteoric water. Barite growth zones with acicular crystals (wires) of emplectite (CuBiS 2), a mineral not previously reported from Summitville, contained primary fluid inclusions that yielded a wide range of vapor to liquid homogenization temperatures as a result of stretching but consistent <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressions</b> that infer an average salinity of 5. 1 wt. % NaCl equivalent. These data indicate that the barite fluids were modestly enriched in magmatic sulfur and metals (Cu, As, Bi, Pb, Zn, Au, Ag) and that barite precipitation was likely triggered by cooling during mixing with meteoric waters. The goethite stage developed during weathering of the deposit that likely occurred during uplift and exposure around 9 to 7. 7 Ma ago based on 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates on jarosite. The assemblage goethite + hematite ± jarosite ± scorodite ± gold filled open spaces and coated barite of the barite-base metal sulfide stage. Inclusions of barite and bladed alunite in the iron oxide/hydroxide (FeOx) matrix have the texture, composition and isotopic values of their earlier formed counterparts in the deposit and therefore represent residual material that survived the weathering event. Three 40 Ar/ 39 Ar dates on the bladed alunite ranged from 23. 15 to 22. 88 Ma, confirming their origin as magmatic hydrothermal alteration alunite. Layers of compositionally zoned, small rhombohedral crystals of alunite were also discovered in the FeOx matrix. Although these could not be successfully dated, they had a distinct texture, chemistry and isotopic composition (δ 34 S = 0. 8 ‰ δ 18 O = 4. 7 ‰) that indicated they formed during the weathering event.

40|$|Pre-activation {{denotes the}} {{capability}} of particles or materials to nucleate ice at lower relative humidities or higher temperatures compared to their intrinsic ice nucleation efficiency after having experienced an ice nucleation event or low temperature before. This review presumes that ice preserved in pores is responsible for pre-activation and analyses pre-activation under this presumption. Idealized trajectories of air parcels are used to discuss the pore characteristics needed for ice to persist in pores and to induce macroscopic ice growth out of the pores. The pore width needed to keep pores filled with water decreases with decreasing relative humidity as described by the inverse Kelvin equation. Thus, narrow pores remain filled with ice well below ice saturation. However, the smaller the pore width, the larger the melting and <b>freezing</b> <b>point</b> <b>depressions</b> within the pores. Therefore, pre-activation due to pore ice is constrained by the melting of ice in narrow pores and the sublimation of ice from wide pores imposing restrictions on the temperature and relative humidity range of pre-activation for cylindrical pores. Ice is better protected in ink-bottle-shaped pores with a narrow opening leading to a large cavity. However, whether pre-activation is efficient also depends on {{the capability of}} ice to grow macroscopically, i. e. out of the pore. A strong effect of pre-activation is expected for swelling pores, because at low relative humidity (RH) their openings narrow and protect the ice within them against sublimation. At high relative humidities, they open up and the ice can grow to macroscopic size and form an ice crystal. Similarly, ice protected in pockets is perfectly sheltered against sublimation but needs {{the dissolution of the}} surrounding matrix to be effective. Pores partially filled with condensable material may also show pre-activation. In this case, complete filling occurs at lower RH than for empty pores and freezing shifts to lower temperatures. Pre-activation experiments confirm that materials susceptible to pre-activation are indeed porous. Pre-activation was observed for clay minerals like illite, kaolinite, and montmorillonite with inherent porosity. The largest effect was observed for the swelling clay mineral montmorillonite. Some materials may acquire porosity, depending on the formation and processing conditions. Particles of CaCO 3, meteoritic material, and volcanic ash showed pre-activation for some samples or in some studies but not in other ones. Quartz and silver iodide were not susceptible to pre-activation. Atmospheric relevance of pre-activation by ice preserved in pores may not be generally given but depend on the atmospheric scenario. Lower-level cloud seeding by pre-activated particles released from high-level clouds crucially depends on the ability of pores to retain ice at the relative humidities and temperatures of the air masses they pass through. Porous particles that are recycled in wave clouds may show pre-activation with subsequent ice growth as soon as ice saturation is exceeded after having passed a first cloud event. Volcanic ash particles and meteoritic material likely influence ice cloud formation by pre-activation. Therefore, the possibility of pre-activation should be considered when ice crystal number densities in clouds exceed the number of ice-nucleating particles measured at the cloud forming temperature...|$|R

50|$|Consider {{the problem}} in which the solvent freezes to a very nearly pure crystal, {{regardless}} {{of the presence of}} the nonvolatile solute.
