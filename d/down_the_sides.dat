5|$|In 2007, {{with the}} {{introduction}} of the Rbk Edge jersey, the Flames updated their look once again, replacing the horizontal striping with vertical striping <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> To honour the team's heritage, the Flames added the flags of Alberta and Canada as shoulder patches. In celebration of their 30th season in Calgary, the Flames wore their original jersey design for five games in 2009–10, each against a Canadian opponent. The 2009-10 version of the jersey was produced in the traditional style that preceded the Edge redesign; for the following season, the throwback design was adapted to the Edge format as the Flames' new regular third jersey.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{wound up}} being {{faithful}} to the comics, many designs were made for Spider-Man's costumes: one concept costume designer James Acheson became fond {{of the idea of}} having a red emblem over a black costume. Another, which would eventually lead to the final product, featured an enlarged logo on the chest and red stripes going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the legs. To create Spider-Man's costume, Maguire was fitted for the skintight suit, being covered with layers of substance to create the suit's shape. It was designed as a single piece, except for the mask. The webbing, which accented the costume, was cut by computer. The mask eye lenses were designed to have a mirror look.|$|E

5|$|The {{infantry}} {{scrambled to}} their feet and rushed forward while the sappers hurried to break <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the antitank ditch with picks and shovels. They advanced on a series of posts held by the 2nd and 3rd Battalions of the Italian 115th Infantry Regiment. Posts 49 and 47 were rapidly overrun, as was Post 46 in the second line beyond. Within half an hour Post 48 had also fallen and another company had taken Posts 45 and 44. The two remaining companies now advanced beyond these positions towards a low stone wall as artillery fire began to fall along the broken wire. The Italians fought from behind the wall until the Australians were inside it, attacking with hand grenades and bayonets. The two companies succeeded in taking 400 prisoners.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bardia {{was fought}} over three days between 3 and 5 January 1941, {{as part of}} Operation Compass, the first {{military}} operation of the Western Desert Campaign of the Second World War. It was the first battle {{of the war in}} which an Australian Army formation took part, the first to be commanded by an Australian general and the first to be planned by an Australian staff. Major General Iven Mackay's 6th Division assaulted the strongly held Italian fortress of Bardia, Libya, assisted by air support and naval gunfire, and under the cover of an artillery barrage. The 16th Infantry Brigade attacked at dawn from the west, where the defences were known to be weak. Sappers blew gaps in the barbed wire with Bangalore torpedoes and filled in and broke <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the anti-tank ditch with picks and shovels. This allowed the infantry and 23 Matilda II tanks of the 7th Royal Tank Regiment to enter the fortress and capture all their objectives, along with 8,000 prisoners.|$|E

In typical counter colored fashion, the underside is generally a yellow or lighter brown color often with black blotching.|$|E
25|$|Traditionally a {{predominantly}} white kit is worn including white shorts and socks. However the jersey usually features some form of red, like red stripes, crosses or chevrons. These colours are similar to other English sporting teams and are the colours used on the national flag. In 2008 a new kit was introduced featuring a red cross {{on the front and}} red strips <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the jersey, shorts and socks were white too with red strips. Also in 2008, the Rugby Football League chose to abandon the traditional English lion on the badge in favour of a much simpler shield and cross design.|$|E

Sometimes the aim is to hit the back of the board in the moments that the assistant is turned away from the thrower. Other throwers have placed a vertical row of knives <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the assistant at the moments when the assistant turns to face them.|$|E
25|$|A major {{producer}} {{outside of}} the capital is Alfarería Aguilera Mayolica Santa Rosa in Mineral de Santa Rosa, near Dolores Hidalgo. The designs of this workshop show indigenous influences, {{as well as some}} Italian and Chinese. Alfarería Aguilera is a family operation, run by several generations of the Aguilera family. Smaller workshops in this town produce both traditional and innovative designs for tableware, flower vases, and tile. One notable workshop is that of Juan Guerrero, who makes tableware with dramatic flowers of orange, yellow, and blue. Juan's father, Fortino, makes pottery with a plain reddish base and decorated with two tones of green glaze allowed to dribble <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> Some containers, such as flowerpots will have salamanders on the side. The making of majolica was introduced to Dolores Hidalgo by Father Miguel Hidalgo himself.|$|E
25|$|The cars as {{delivered}} featured rattan {{seats and}} incandescent lighting, staples of most pre-WWII subway cars in New York City. All {{areas of the}} cars were lit, as bulbs were placed along the center roofline and <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of each car's interior. Additionally, pairs of bulbs on each end lit each end vestibule. As delivered, they did not come with fans, however windows and clerestory vents along the upper roof could be opened for ventilation. All windows were drop sash type (rather than rising sash type) for improved safety and {{to reduce the amount}} of draught in moving cars. Floors were made of wood (maple), and grab holds were provided along the roof for standees. Originally, these grab holds were made of leather (as on elevated trains), and later replaced with the steel grab holds that were IRT standard for many years.|$|E

25|$|The HX series {{release of}} 1976 saw only minor updates to the exterior, notably the grille and badgework, {{although}} base specification utilities and panel vans retained the HJ grill (except Sandman which got HX Kingswood frontal treatment). When the HX was released, government emissions controls had been tightened and Holden {{needed to make}} significant changes to their engines. This resulted {{in a loss of}} performance across the range and the deletion of the 2.84-litre straight-six. In addition, a Kingswood panel van was introduced to the range of commercial vehicle offerings. The HX Sandman introduced a large 'Sandman' logo on the tailgate and stripes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides.</b> During the course of the HX series, front bucket seats were adopted as standard equipment for Kingswood-badged vehicles. As with the previous series, a couple of special-build HX Kingswood variants emerged later in production, initially with the Kingswood 50th Anniversary sedan in November 1976 and also a repeat appearance of the Kingswood Deluxe sedan.|$|E
25|$|At this stage, {{it is only}} {{slightly}} curved or may have no curve at all. The katanas gentle curvature is attained by a process of differential hardening or differential quenching: the smith coats the blade with several layers of a wet clay slurry, which is a special concoction unique to each sword maker, but generally composed of clay, water and any or none of ash, grinding stone powder, or rust. This process is called tsuchioki. The edge of the blade is coated with a thinner layer than the sides and spine of the sword, heated, and then quenched in water (few sword makers use oil to quench the blade). The slurry causes only the blade's edge to be hardened and also causes the blade to curve due to the difference in densities of the micro-structures in the steel. When steel with a carbon content of 0.7% is heated beyond 750°C, it enters the austenite phase. When austenite is cooled very suddenly by quenching in water, the structure changes into martensite, {{which is a very}} hard form of steel. When austenite is allowed to cool slowly, its structure changes into a mixture of ferrite and pearlite which is softer than martensite. This process also creates the distinct line <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the blade called the hamon, which is made distinct by polishing. Each hamon and each smith's style of hamon is distinct.|$|E

500|$|Cerro Azul is {{responsible}} for several of South America's largest recorded eruptions, in 1846 and 1932. In 1846, an effusive eruption formed the vent {{at the site of}} present-day Quizapu crater on the northern flank of Cerro Azul and sent lava flowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides</b> of the volcano, creating a lava field 8–9 square kilometres (3–3.5 square miles) in area. Phreatic and Strombolian volcanism between 1907 and 1932 excavated this crater. In 1932, one of the largest explosive eruptions of the 20thcentury occurred at Quizapu Crater and sent [...] of ash into the atmosphere. The volcano's most recent eruption was in 1967.|$|E
500|$|The {{first version}} {{is the largest}} Etruscan temple recorded, and much larger than other Roman temples for centuries after. [...] However, its size remains heavily disputed by specialists; based on an ancient visitor it has been {{claimed to have been}} almost , not far short of the largest Greek temples. [...] Whatever its size, its {{influence}} on other early Roman temples was significant and long-lasting. [...] Reconstructions usually show very wide eaves, and a wide colonnade stretching <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>sides,</b> though not round the back wall as it would have done in a Greek temple. [...] A crude image on a coin of 78 BC shows only four columns, and a very busy roofline.|$|E
