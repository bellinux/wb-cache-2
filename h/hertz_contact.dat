We formally derive a spatially discrete modulation equation, for small amplitude nonlinear waves consisting of slow modulations of time-periodic linear oscillations. The fully-nonlinear and unilateral interactions between beads yield a nonstandard modulation equation that we call the discrete p-Schroedinger (DpS) equation. It consists of a spatial discretization of a generalized Schroedinger equation with p-Laplacian, with fractional p> 2 depending on the exponent of <b>Hertz's</b> <b>contact</b> force. We show that the DpS equation admits explicit periodic travelling wave solutions, and numerically find a plethora of standing wave solutions given by the orbits of a discrete map, in particular spatially localized breather solutions. Using a modified Lyapunov-Schmidt technique, we prove the existence of exact periodic travelling waves {{in the chain of}} beads, close to the small amplitude modulated waves given by the DpS equation. Using numerical simulations, we show that the DpS equation captures several other important features of the dynamics in the weakly nonlinear regime, namely modulational instabilities, the existence of static and travelling breathers, and repulsive or attractive interactions of these localized structures...|$|R

An algorithm to trans-form the outer surfaces geometric properties to the lo-cal contact coordinates system is described. It tracks permanently in time the surfaces of the bodies which are able to contact. An approach to compute the normal elastic force is represented. That one deals with the reduction to one transcendental scalar equation that includes the com-plete elliptic integrals of the fist and second kinds. Sim-ulation of the Hertz model was accelerated essentially due to use of the differential technique to compute the complete elliptic integrals and due to {{the replacement of the}} implicit transcendental equation by the differen-tial one. Based on the <b>Hertz</b> <b>contact</b> problem classic solution an invariant form for the force function which depends on the geometric properties of an intersection for the undeformed rigid bodies volumes, so-called volumet-ric model, is proposed then.

We close the discussion by highlighting the key characteristics of the mechanisms that facilitate strong attenuation of incident impulse. These include low frequency to high frequency (LF-HF) scattering, and turbulence-like cascading in a periodic system.
