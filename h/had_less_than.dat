5|$|Australia <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 15 {{minutes of}} batting before the {{scheduled}} close of play. Barnes made an unsuccessful appeal {{against the light}} after the first ball of the innings, which was a wide by Edrich. Morris and Barnes successfully negotiated the new ball by Edrich and Bedser to reach stumps with 17 without loss. Ideal batting conditions and clear weather greeted {{the players on the}} second day. Barnes and Morris took the score to 73 before Morris was bowled by Laker's off spin. Bradman came in and the score progressed to 121 when Barnes cut Laker onto the thigh of wicket-keeper Evans. The ball bounced away and the gloveman turned around and took a one-handed diving catch to dismiss Barnes for 62. Miller came in and was dismissed for a duck without further addition to Australia's total. He failed to pick Laker's arm ball, which went straight on, clipped the outside edge and was taken at slip by Edrich.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, the Kennel Club {{recognised}} the Dandie Dinmont Terrier {{as one of}} {{the rarest}} dog breeds native to the British Isles, putting it on a new list of Vulnerable Native Breeds. The breeds chosen for this list were those who originated in the UK and Ireland, but <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 300 puppy registrations per year. One particularly low period was between July and September 2003, when only 21 puppies were registered, of which 18 were male. Overall that year, only 90 puppies were registered in the UK, compared to 9,823 for the West Highland White Terrier. Additionally numbers had dropped to low levels in America as well, with the AKC registering only 75 puppies in the same time period. Following work since 2006, the Dandie Dinmont registration numbers have improved slightly, with 151 puppies registered with the Kennel Club in 2010, the highest number for any year in the last ten years. Of other breeds of native terrier, only the Skye, Sealyham, Manchester and Glen of Imaal Terriers have lower registration figures.|$|E

5|$|On {{the night}} of 28 November, the PVA 80th Division {{attacked}} again with four regiments. At the inlet, the Chinese assault became a disaster as communications broke down while devastating fire from the anti-aircraft (AA) guns attached to the 57th Field Artillery Battalion swept the Chinese ranks. In {{the aftermath of the}} fighting, the PVA 238th and the 239th Regiment together <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 600 soldiers. The attacks by PVA 240th Regiment, on the other hand, forced Maclean to order a retreat from the northern hills towards the inlet. On 29 November, the 1st Battalion managed to break through the Chinese blockade and reached the inlet, but Maclean disappeared as he mistook some Chinese soldiers as American. The Chinese finally stopped their attacks on {{the night of}} 29 November while waiting for fresh reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|The tenth caution {{was given}} on lap 243 when Harvick and Kyle Busch collided, {{resulting}} in Busch spinning sideways and colliding into the wall. His car was engulfed in flames, {{but he was}} pulled from the car by NASCAR personnel. At the lap 250 restart, Edwards was the leader, ahead of Johnson, Kenseth, and Harvick. On the following lap, Harvick passed Kenseth for third, as Hamlin fell to 21st. By lap 254, Edwards <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> a one-second lead over Johnson, while Harvick was 2.59 seconds behind. Edwards continued to increase his lead, as Hamlin passed Martin for 15th. With seven laps remaining, Edwards had a 1.67 second lead over Johnson. As Edwards crossed the finish line to win the race, Johnson won his fifth consecutive championship. Harvick finished third, ahead of Almirola and Allmendinger in fourth and fifth. Kahne, Newman, Stewart, Kenseth and Biffle rounded out the top ten finishers in the race.|$|E
5|$|Troop {{numbers for}} each side have been {{difficult}} to estimate. The North Korean army had around 70,000 combat troops committed to the Pusan Perimeter on August 5, with most of its divisions far understrength. It likely <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 3,000 personnel in mechanized units, and around 40 T-34 tanks at the front, due to extensive losses so far in the war. MacArthur reported 141,808 UN troops in Korea on August 4, of which 47,000 were in US ground combat units and 45,000 in South Korean combat units. Thus the UN ground combat force outnumbered the North Koreans 92,000 to 70,000. UN forces had complete control of the air and sea throughout the fight as well, and US Air Force and US Navy elements provided support for the ground units throughout the battle virtually unopposed.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most Bollywood films which {{indulge in}} months of {{promotion}} before the release, Aashiqui 2 <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> three weeks for promotion before its release. A music concert where singers (who sang {{songs in the}} soundtrack album) performed to their respective songs was organised to promote the film. The makers of the film launched the Aashiqui 2 jackets, {{as seen in the}} film's poster. Statues resembling the signature image of the couple hiding under the jacket were placed inside various theatres. Due to the romantic theme of the film, it was originally planned for a Valentine's day release on 14 February 2013, but this was postponed because of production delays. The film's new release date was 10 May 2013, but it was released a fortnight early on 26 April 2013 in over 2800 screens across India. The film was not released in key markets such as UK, US, Canada, Australia and New Zealand.|$|E
5|$|Despite his {{receiving}} unit being plagued by injuries, Jay Cutler ended {{the season with}} 3,629 passing yards, 21 touchdowns, 11 interceptions and career highs in passer rating (92.3) and completion percentage (64.4). The eleven interceptions were the lowest in his career and resulted in an interception percentage of 2.3, the lowest in a season when he has started at least 12 games. The 21 touchdowns were his second-most since 2011 and the 3,629 yards were the third-most in his career. On third down, Cutler had a 103.2 passer rating (fourth in the NFL) after completing 91 of 141 passes for 1,242 yards, seven touchdowns and two interceptions. With five lost fumbles, Cutler had a total of sixteen turnovers in 2015, eight fewer than in 2014. In his lone start against the Seahawks, Jimmy Clausen completed 9 of 17 passes for 63 yards, and including sacks, recorded 48 net passing yards, the second time since the 1990 season that the Bears <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 50 net yards passing. The Bears ended the year with 228.9 passing yards per game, ranked 23rd in the league. The quarterbacking group ended {{the season with a}} combined 63.9 completion percentage and 2.3 interception percentage, both of which ranked third in team history, along with 3,843 gross passing yards and a 42.5 third down percentage (fourth), 3,660 net passing yards (fifth), along with 5,514 total net yards and a 89.7 passer rating (sixth).|$|E
5|$|Before the 1956 season, the Giants, who had {{previously}} been renting the Polo Grounds from baseball's Giants {{at a rate of}} $75,000 a year, began playing their home games at Yankee Stadium. The Giants run of championship game appearances in their late 1950s and early 1960s combined with their large market location translated into financial success. In 1958 they set a new home attendance record when 71,163 fans attended their November 8 game against Baltimore. And in 1959 they established their next four highest home game totals by drawing between 66,000 and 68,000 fans for games versus the Eagles, Packers, Browns, and Steelers. By the early 1960s, the Giants were receiving $175,000 a game under the NFL's television contract with CBS—four times as much as small-market Green Bay, {{which was one of the}} most successful teams of the era. However, in the league's new contract, the Maras convinced the other owners that it would be in the best interest of the NFL to share television revenue equally, a practice which is still current, and is credited with strengthening the NFL. The Giants and professional football as a whole, were helped financially by their contest versus the Baltimore Colts in the 1958 NFL Championship game. The televised game became the first professional football game to go into overtime, and is credited with increasing the popularity of the NFL in the US. The explosion in interest in pro football was evidenced in the Giants financials: in 1956 they <b>had</b> <b>less</b> <b>than</b> 8,000 season ticket holders and by 1963 that number had increased to over 50,000. They sold out every home game in 1962 and 1963. Additionally, while scalpers hardly existed in 1956, by 1963 they regularly received $25 for a $5 ticket.|$|E
