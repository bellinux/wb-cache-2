5000|$|The diameters of the {{cartridge}} are, logically, {{smaller than the}} appropriate diameters of the chamber. But the corresponding lengths [...] "L1" [...] and [...] "L2" [...] are larger. This condition results {{from the fact that}} the length of the junction cone becomes larger if the diameter becomes smaller. With most European cartridges, the dimension [...] "S" [...] is always identical. On the other hand, many American cartridge designs exhibit an oversize designated as delta L (ΔL). This leads to the situation that a cartridge manufactured at the upper tolerance limit can not be loaded into a chamber that was manufactured at the lower tolerance limit. Because cartridges are often manufactured in the lower <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits and chambers tend to be manufactured in the higher <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> limits, these problems are often avoided with (semi) automatic and repeating arms.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{provides}} a new robust design method to dimension a mechanism and to synthesize its <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> The general issue {{is to find}} a robust mechanism for a given task, and to compute its optimal <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances.</b> For that purpose, the developed approach follows two consecutive steps, which are independent and complementary. First, the dimensions of the mechanism are computed by means of an appropriate robustness index, which is used to minimize the sensitivity of its performances to variations. These robust dimensions are obtained independently of the amount of variations, and tolerate globally the largest variations. Thus, knowing the acceptable performance error of the mechanism, the second step aims at computing the optimal <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerances</b> of the mechanism by means of the new tolerance synthesis method.

50|$|Although {{the whole}} {{workpiece}} may be {{inserted into the}} die, the sizing operation can give dimensional accuracy to {{a portion of the}} part based on the contact with the die.

50|$|Field {{use of the}} K98a rifles {{showed that}} as an {{infantry}} weapon, and not a weapon for auxiliary or special troops as originally purposed, the design was inadequate. The greatest flaw was the weak bayonet mount (the bayonet lug would break off when hitting hard objects). The K98a also used a small-ring Mauser action, which complicated production and parts interchangeability. Following the postwar shift to large-ring carbines with 600 mm barrels and Gewehr 98-style bayonet lug/muzzle lengths, such as the Czech vz. 24, {{the decision was made}} to develop an intermediate model rifle for the Polish Army. The design was finalized in 1929. The new wz.29 rifle was based on the old wz.98 rifle, but with a shortened stock and barrel, stronger alloys for the receiver and barrel, a reinforced chamber, and increased <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance</b> in the action, allowing for easy interchangeability of parts. There were two versions of the rifle: Infantry models had straight bolt handles, while cavalry models had curved handles. Since both variations used the same stock, infantry models had a cutout in the stock for the curved handle.|$|E

[...] "full-access") cabinets {{utilize the}} carcase side, top, and bottom panels to serve same functions as do face-frames in traditional cabinets. In general, frameless cabinets provide better utilization of space than face-frame cabinets. A preference for frameless cabinet design developed in Europe in the 1950s and 1960s following {{the devastation of}} World War II and the increasing cost of lumber. A burgeoning market for reconstructed housing in Central Europe offered a fertile environment for developments in efficient hinge and cabinet designs. Frameless cabinets rely on manufacturing methods that permit the production of modern cabinet hardware (hinges and slides) and engineered wood products (for strength, <b>dimensional</b> <b>tolerance,</b> and stability). The intent of the frameless design is to achieve a more streamlined appearance and a more efficient use of space, with ergonomically designed moving components such as drawers, trays, and pull-out cabinets providing better access to interior components. A number of benefits stemming from frameless cabinet design have been successfully applied to face-frame cabinets, such as multiple drawers in base cabinets, full-overlay doors, and cup hinges. With the rise in popularity of European style frameless cabinetry, {{a significant proportion of}} the hardware used by U.S. cabinet manufacturers is imported from Europe.|$|E
