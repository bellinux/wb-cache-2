5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder and Scully investigate a case where a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> declares {{that he will be}} reincarnated and that as a result five men will die.|$|E
5|$|An unusual slapstick mix of film noir, black {{comedy and}} B-movie conventions, the film portrays bizarre {{situations}} involving a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate.</b> The film was a box-office flop, {{and has since}} fallen into obscurity outside of fans of Campbell and Raimi. Few critics reviewed the film, though the little amount of critical attention it received was mostly negative. Several elements of the film influenced later productions by Raimi, {{and the failure of}} Crimewave directly led to the inception of Evil Dead II (1987). The film has achieved the status of a minor cult film.|$|E
5|$|Cordray {{was granted}} a ruling by the Ohio Supreme Court that lower courts could not grant a stay of {{execution}} for a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate.</b> At the same time, Fisher, Cordray's boss, sought a referendum to mandate that appeals in death penalty cases be made directly to the Supreme Court. In 1994 the 6th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Steffen v. Tate (39 F.3d 622 1994) limited death row inmates to a single federal appeal and said that federal courts cannot stay an execution if the case is still in a state court.|$|E
50|$|Formerly, the {{majority}} of Ohio's <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> were held at OSP. In January 2012, {{the majority}} of <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> were transferred to the Chillicothe Correctional Institution. OSP does retain <b>death</b> <b>row</b> cells for <b>inmates</b> who are considered the highest security risk. As of January 2012, six high security <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> remain at OSP.|$|R
5000|$|... 708 male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> {{were held}} at San Quentin.

5|$|In February 1999, David Protess, a Northwestern University journalism professor, and his {{students}} were studying cases of people on death row. They discovered evidence related to <b>Death</b> <b>Row</b> <b>inmate</b> Anthony Porter that might help exonerate him. The students produced four affidavits and a videotaped statement that attributed guilt for the crime to another suspect. They obtained recantations by some witnesses of their testimony at trial. One witness claimed that he named Anthony Porter as a suspect only after police officers threatened, harassed and intimidated him into doing so.|$|E
5|$|As more {{information}} about Burge's reign was published, activists worked to save some Chicago inmates on death row {{who claimed to have}} been wrongfully convicted. In 1998, representatives from the MacArthur Justice Center at the University of Chicago Law School, the London-based International Center for Criminal Law and Human Rights, law professor Anthony Amsterdam, former federal judges George N. Leighton and Abner Mikva, Illinois judge R. Eugene Pincham, and British activist Bianca Jagger, called for a stay of execution for Aaron Patterson, a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> from Chicago. His conviction for murder was based primarily on a confession which he claimed was coerced by torture from Burge and his officers.|$|E
25|$|During his term, 37 {{people were}} {{executed}} in Virginia. Gilmore granted executive clemency to one <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> {{on the basis}} of mental illness. In another well publicized case, he pardoned Earl Washington, a former <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate,</b> after DNA tests, ordered by Gilmore, implicated another person. Gilmore also ordered DNA tests in the case of Derek Rocco Barnabei; the tests confirmed Barnabei's guilt and he was executed.|$|E
50|$|In 1974 male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates,</b> {{previously}} at the Tucker Unit, {{were moved}} to the Cummins Unit. In 1986 male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> {{were moved to}} the Maximum Security Unit. On Friday August 22, 2003, all 39 Arkansas <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates,</b> all of them male, were moved to the Supermax at the Varner Unit.|$|R
50|$|From 1912 to January 1990 male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> were {{housed in}} the Central Correctional Institution (CCI). BRCI held male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> from January 1990 to April 12, 1997, when male <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> were moved to Lieber.

50|$|The {{practice}} of <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> donating organs while alive follows closely {{to that of}} their more general inmate counterparts. Where they differ is in their inability have their organs donated following their execution. Although no law specifically forbids <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> from donating organs postmortem, as of 2013 all requests by <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> to donate their organs after execution have been denied by states. Additionally there is debate about whether current organ donation guidelines, outlined in the National Organ Transplant Act of 1984 and the Uniform Anatomical Gift Act, implicitly prohibit <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> from being organ donors.|$|R
50|$|While <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> sentenced {{by state}} governments may appeal to both state courts and federal courts, federal <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> may only appeal to federal courts; this gives them fewer avenues of appeal.|$|R

At {{the time of the}} attack, Gacy had been out of his cell {{participating}} in a voluntary work program when Brisbon ran towards Gacy and stabbed him once in the upper arm with a sharpened wire. A second <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> injured in the attack, William Jones, received a superficial stab wound to the head. Both Gacy and Jones received treatment in the prison hospital for their wounds.|$|E

50|$|In 1974 <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates,</b> {{previously}} at the Tucker Unit, {{were moved}} to the Cummins Unit.

25|$|In late 2003, Morissette {{appeared}} in the Off-Broadway play The Exonerated as Sunny Jacobs, a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> freed after proof surfaced that she was innocent. In April 2006, MTV News reported that Morissette would reprise her role in The Exonerated in London from May 23 until May 28.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, Blumenthal {{testified in}} the State Legislature {{in favor of}} abolishing Connecticut’s death penalty statute. He did so after {{representing}} Florida <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> Joseph Green Brown, who had been wrongly convicted. Blumenthal succeeded in staving off Brown’s execution just 15 hours before it was scheduled to take place.|$|E
25|$|In 2000 Frank Lee Smith was proved {{innocent}} by DNA profiling of {{the murder}} of an eight-year-old girl after spending 14 years on death row in Florida, USA. However he had died of cancer just before his innocence was proven. In view of this the Florida state governor ordered that in future any <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> claiming innocence should have DNA testing.|$|E
50|$|The {{same reasons}} {{that make the}} general prison {{population}} less suitable to be organ donors—poor health and increased chance of infectious disease—also apply to <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates.</b> However, due to the preplanned nature of executions and lengthy time periods before they are carried out <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> have a greater potential to be screened thoroughly beforehand. Additionally many <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> are in isolation from the general population, reducing their chances of having contracted a communicable disease.|$|R
50|$|Other factors, however, variably {{decrease}} {{the suitability of}} <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> as organ donors. The average age of people on <b>death</b> <b>row</b> is over 50, and chronic medical conditions such as diabetes and hypertension are common. Potentially half of <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> would be unsuitable for organ donation.|$|R
50|$|The prison {{opened in}} 1988. In January 1990 the <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmates</b> were {{moved from the}} Central Correctional Institution to Broad River.

25|$|Anthony Porter (born 1955) is a Chicago {{resident}} {{and was a}} prisoner on death row, convicted of the 1982 murder of two teenagers, before his conviction was overturned in 1999, following the investigation of Northwestern University professors and students from the Medill School of Journalism {{as part of the}} Medill Innocence Project. Porter is notable for being an exonerated <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> who was once only 50 hours away from execution.|$|E
25|$|A 1911 statute {{was passed}} by the Nevada Legislature that allowed a <b>death</b> <b>row</b> <b>inmate</b> to opt to die by {{shooting}} or hanging; that statute was overturned in 1921. Mircovich was insistent on shooting, claiming that hanging often took too long. After the Nevada State Prison warden, George W. Cowing, was unable to find five men to form a firing squad, a shooting machine was requisitioned and built to carry out the execution.|$|E
