5|$|Wyatt Earp <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{not rely}} on civil justice, and decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands. He {{concluded}} {{that the only way to}} deal with Morgan's assassins was to kill them all.|$|E
5|$|Bowie had {{originally}} {{planned to take}} the Glass Spider Tour to Russia, albeit with the band only (no dancers or elaborate props), but with the money and extra stage provided by the sponsorship, Bowie <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> take the full tour to Russia and South America. However, these plans failed to come to fruition, and the tour never reached those regions.|$|E
5|$|Himmler began {{developing}} {{the notion of}} a Germanic religion and wanted SS members to leave the church. In early 1936, Heydrich left the Catholic Church. His wife, Lina, had already done so the year before. Heydrich not only <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> no longer be a member, but came to consider the church's political power and influence a danger to the state.|$|E
60|$|It {{was over}} a week afore <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'e</b> <b>could</b> risk letting Miss Tucker see 'im, and then at seven o'clock one evening <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>'e</b> couldn't wait any longer, and arter {{spending}} an hour cleaning 'imself he started out for the Jolly Pilots.|$|R

5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, manager Dave Hagan and his {{assistant}} Eric Tate left the club. Hagan <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not operate a competitive team on the team's small budget, and so took up an assistant job at Consett. Ian Davison, a player at the club, took up managerial duties, acting as a player-manager, and appointing Gary Innes as {{his assistant}}. Steve Murray is the current Tow Law manager, taking up the role in December 2014.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} to the Nazi–Soviet pact on 23 August 1939, the RAF mobilised. Cunningham had been test-flying the airliner de Havilland Dragon. Only 16 were complete before the declaration of war in September. The growing tension in Europe made war more likely. John was forced to commit himself either to de Havilland or the RAF at this juncture. The RAF had trained him and he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> be of far more use in the RAF than test-flying aircraft.|$|E
5|$|To {{fill the}} demand for other aircraft, {{especially}} smaller ones like the de Havilland Mosquito, the Air Ministry began looking at US manufacturers to supply the bombsight. Frederic Blin Vose of Sperry Gyroscope {{expressed an interest in}} the design and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> adapt the Mk. XIV to US production methods and have it in mass production rapidly. Sperry arranged for AC Spark Plug to take over manufacture, initially on a sub-contract basis and later for direct sales to the UK.|$|E

60|$|Lord St. Maurice <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{afford to}} accept the rebuke, and he bowed his head.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I can't say exactly." [...] He {{would not}} say {{that he did not}} know, but <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> truly say that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not say.|$|R
5|$|Dobell's Eastern Force {{consisted}} of two infantry divisions, the 42nd (East Lancashire) Division commanded by Major General W. Douglas and the 52nd (Lowland) Division commanded by Major General W. E. B. Smith, {{as well as the}} Anzac Mounted Division, a mounted infantry division commanded by Chauvel, the 5th Mounted Brigade commanded by Brigadier General E. A. Wiggin and the Imperial Camel Brigade commanded by Brigadier General Clement Leslie Smith. Murray considered this force to be under strength by at least a division for an advance to Beersheba, but <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> gain El Arish and form an effective base on the coast, from which further operations eastwards could be supplied.|$|E
5|$|Longstreet was not {{enthusiastic}} about secession from the Union, {{but he had}} long been infused {{with the concept of}} states' rights, and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not go against his homeland. Although he was born in South Carolina and reared in Georgia, he offered his services to the state of Alabama, which had appointed him to West Point and where his mother still lived. Furthermore, he was the senior West Point graduate from that state, which implied a commensurate rank in the state's forces would be available. After settling his accounts, he resigned from the U.S. Army on May 8, 1861 to cast his lot with the Confederacy in the Civil War.|$|E
5|$|On {{returning}} to his bush camp, Wilson sent a further message to the laager, which reached its destination at around 23:00: Napier, Scout Bain and Trooper Robertson were the men acting as runners. Wilson repeated {{that he was going}} to stay north of the river overnight, close to the king, and asked Forbes to bring the whole column across by 04:00 in the morning. Forbes thought it unwise to attempt a full river crossing at night, which he reasoned might lead to his force being surrounded in the darkness and massacred, but also <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not recall Wilson, as to do so would be to lose Lobengula for sure.|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, so you've arrived!" [...] cried Dick cheerily, but {{his voice}} had a catch in it. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> guilty, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not tell why.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That is why I have come,' {{answered}} the king; and suddenly his heart seemed to fail him and <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not go on.|$|R
5|$|On the February 14, 2008, {{episode of}} Impact!, Tomko {{announced}} he attacked Christian Cage {{at the event}} because he no longer wanted an alliance with Cage and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> become a star on his own. Tomko then joined The Angle Alliance later on the same episode. On the February 21, 2008, episode of Impact!, it was revealed a Six-Man Tag Team match pitting the team of Cage, Samoa Joe, and Kevin Nash against The Angle Alliance (Kurt Angle, A.J. Styles, and Tomko) was planned for the Destination X PPV event on March 9, 2008. At Destination X, Cage, Joe, and Nash under The Unlikely Alliance moniker defeated The Angle Alliance.|$|E
5|$|Penney {{and some}} of his staff {{returned}} by air on 9 October. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire on 23 October 1952 for his role in Operation Hurricane. Torlesse was supposed to accompany him, but in view of the degree of radioactive contamination, he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not leave his command. He sent Captain D. P. Willan, the skipper of Narvik in his stead. The Royal Navy ships departed the Monte Bello Islands on 31 October. Most of the scientific staff were dropped off at Fremantle, and returned to Britain on RAF Transport Command aircraft. The rest returned on Campania, which arrived in the United Kingdom on 15 December. Hawkesbury continued to patrol the area until 15 January 1953.|$|E
5|$|Two years later, {{the two had}} a major {{argument}} over the country's budget, as Banza adamantly opposed Bokassa's extravagant spending. Bokassa moved to Camp de Roux, where he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> safely run the government without {{having to worry about}} Banza's thirst for power. In the meantime, Banza tried to obtain a support base within the army, spending much of his time in the company of soldiers. Bokassa recognized what his minister was doing, so he sent military units most sympathetic to Banza to the country's border and brought his own army supporters as close to the capital as possible. In September 1967, he took a special trip to Paris, where he asked for protection from French troops. Two months later, the government deployed 80 paratroopers to Bangui.|$|E
50|$|On October 17, 2014, Roberts {{announced}} his retirement from professional baseball. He issued a statement that said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> like <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not play well anymore.|$|R
6000|$|... "Dondersteen!" [...] {{he said as}} soon as <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> speak again, [...] "but thou truly art {{a strange}} wench. Whatever did put that idea into thy head?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I {{shall not}} see her. I am going back with you,' said Robert, {{instantly}} deciding, now that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> both leave Phoebe, and trust {{himself with the}} offender.|$|R
5|$|Despite the {{strength}} of Malvern Hill, as demonstrated in the battle, McClellan felt he needed to continue with his planned withdrawal to Harrison's Landing, to Fitz John Porter's chagrin. Porter felt that the Army of the Potomac should remain atop the hill or perhaps even continue their advance to Richmond. McClellan however insisted that Confederate troops greatly outnumbered his own, <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not protect Harrison's Landing from his current position at Malvern Hill, and feared being cut off from his supply depot. McClellan's mentality prevailed. The Union batteries and McClellan's engineers began moving to Harrison's Landing soon {{after the end of}} the Battle of Malvern Hill. Starting at about 11p.m. unit after unit began to follow. Within hours, nearly all of McClellan's Army of the Potomac was marching towards Harrison's Landing. Once the last of these men had crossed the Turkey Island Bridge, they destroyed the bridge and felled trees over it to stymie any pursuit, leaving the James River between the Union and Confederate armies.|$|E
5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As part of that change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|In 1960 Solti {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} to be {{music director of the}} Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1962. Even before he took the post the Philharmonic's autocratic president, Dorothy Chandler, breached his contract by appointing a deputy music director without Solti's approval. Although he admired the chosen deputy, Zubin Mehta, Solti <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not have his authority undermined from the outset, and he withdrew from his appointment. He accepted an offer to become musical director of Covent Garden Opera Company, London. When first sounded out about the post he had declined it. After 14 years of experience at Munich and Frankfurt he was uncertain that he wanted a third successive operatic post. Moreover, founded only 15 years earlier, the Covent Garden company was not yet the equal of the best opera houses in Europe. Bruno Walter convinced Solti that it was his duty to take Covent Garden on.|$|E
60|$|Galletly chuckled {{over the}} recollection, his wicked little eyes glistening with delight. Telford was thankful {{when they reached}} the store. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not endure this man's society any longer.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{had been}} discovered!--he was still safe! But if he {{stayed at the}} cavity till the mists faded before the moonlight, <b>could</b> <b>he</b> be certain of {{preserving}} his security? <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not! ...|$|R
60|$|At this Hank Stiger winced, for he {{knew only}} too well that Mr. Radbury spoke the truth. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not go too far or he might get into deeper trouble.|$|R
5|$|Following its losses, the 66th Division {{was reduced}} to cadre early in May; which meant that {{infantry}} battalions were cut to ten officers and about 45 men, the surplus being sent to base depots; the artillery, engineer and machine-gun units were distributed among other formations. The divisional artillery was attached to XIX Corps during the Battle of the Avre on 4 April and with XI Corps at the Battle of the Lys later in the month. During the summer, Bethell continued planning for the rebuilding of the division, having recruited a staff he <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> work with, expecting that experienced men would become available as drafts returned from the Mediterranean. Overseas divisions there had suffered fewer casualties and the reduction from four to three battalions per brigade meant {{that large numbers of}} men would be returning. While reinforcements were assembled, the divisional cadres of the 66th Division and the 39th Division were used to train five American divisions in the British zone. The training process was complicated by a rigid schedule laid down by the American high command, who strongly objected to any deviation from their plans. In July, the American divisions moved up to the front and British troops began to arrive from Salonika and Palestine, though the assembly of the division was delayed by the returning men being given home leave and having to spend time acclimatising.|$|E
5|$|Johnson's negotiators {{hoped to}} reach a truce in Vietnam prior to the election. Nixon {{received}} astute analysis on the talks from Henry Kissinger, then a consultant to U.S. negotiator Averell Harriman, and his campaign was in regular contact with Anna Chennault (at a July 1968 meeting in Nixon's New York apartment with South Vietnamese ambassador Bùi Diễm, he had been informed that Chennault would represent Nixon during the campaign). She advised South Vietnamese president Thieu {{not to go to}} Paris to join the talks, hinting that Nixon would give him a better deal if elected. Johnson was aware of what was going on, as he had both Chennault and the South Vietnamese ambassador to Washington bugged, and was enraged by what he considered an attempt by Nixon to undermine U.S. foreign policy. On October 31, with no agreement, Johnson announced a unilateral halt to the bombing, and that peace negotiations would start in Paris on November 6, the day after Election Day. On November 2, after speaking with Chennault again, Thieu stated he would not go to Paris. Johnson telephoned Nixon, who denied any involvement; the President did not believe him. Johnson <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not publicly mention Chennault's involvement, which had been obtained by wiretapping, but told Humphrey, who chose not to use the information.|$|E
5|$|Mason faced {{difficulties}} in being {{elected to the}} ratifying convention from Fairfax County, since most freeholders there were Federalist, and he was at odds with many in Alexandria over local politics. The statute governing elections to the convention in Richmond allowed him to seek election elsewhere, and he campaigned for a seat from Stafford County, assuring electors {{that he did not}} seek disunion, but rather reform. He spoke against the unamended constitution in strong terms; George Nicholas, a Federalist friend of Mason, believed that Mason <b>felt</b> <b>he</b> <b>could</b> lead Virginia to gain concessions from the other states, and that he was embittered by the continuing attacks on him. On March 10, 1788, Mason finished first in the polls in Stafford County, winning one of its two seats; he apparently was the only person elected for a constituency in which he did not live. Voter turnout was low, as many in remote areas without newspapers knew little about the constitution. The Federalists were believed to have a slight advantage in elected delegates; Mason thought that the convention would be unlikely to ratify the document without demanding amendments.|$|E
