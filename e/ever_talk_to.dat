5|$|There {{are those}} who will {{consider}} it their duty, as friends of the Negro people, to tell us to revile him, to flee, even from the presence of his memory, to save ourselves by writing {{him out of the}} history of our turbulent times. Many will ask what Harlem finds to honor in this stormy, controversial and bold young captainand we will smile. Many will say turn awayaway from this man, for he is not a man but a demon, a monster, a subverter and an enemy of the black manand we will smile. They will say that he is of hatea fanatic, a racistwho can only bring evil to the cause for which you struggle! And we will answer and say to them: Did you <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Brother Malcolm? Did you ever touch him, or have him smile at you? Did you ever really listen to him? Did he ever do a mean thing? Was he ever himself associated with violence or any public disturbance? For if you did you would know him. And if you knew him you would know why we must honor him... And, in honoring him, we honor the best in ourselves.|$|E
500|$|Hannah Levin of the Seattle {{publication}} The Stranger {{analyzed the}} lyrics to the track [...] "Mrs. Jones", calling it a [...] "particularly rattling sketch of {{what appears to be}} a rape scene, with Love seamlessly handling three perspectives: the ugly attacker ("Look into the bloodrot, you suicide bitch / It takes an hour with you to make me want to live"), the vengeful victim ("The abortion left an abscess / Don't <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me like that again"), and the supportive narrator ("Just like a pro, she takes off her dress / And she kicks you down in her snow white pumps")." [...] The song also makes direct references to The Ballad of East and West, a poem by Rudyard Kipling, with the line: [...] "East is east and west is west, and mine was you and mine was best", which is a partial quote from the poem.|$|E

50|$|On January 24, 2011, Palawan {{journalist}} Gerry Ortega {{was assassinated}} after finishing his radio show. One of the suspects, Rodolfo Edrad, Jr. confessed shortly after and {{claimed to be}} a former bodyguard of Carrion's.

60|$|NORA [deeply offended]. I suppose {{people are}} {{different}} in England, Mr Broadbent; so perhaps you don't mean any harm. In Ireland nobody'd mind what a man'd say in fun, nor take advantage of what a woman might say in answer to it. If a woman couldn't talk to a man for two minutes at their first meeting without being treated the way you're treating me, no decent woman would <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> a man at all.|$|E

6000|$|... 'Naturally buoyant spirits, {{the gift}} of a merry heart, are a great help; for oftentimes a man may have to spend months without any white man within {{hundreds}} of miles, {{and it is very}} depressing to live alone in the midst of heathenism. But there must be many many fellows pulling up to Surley to-night who may be well able to pull together with one on the Pacific--young fellows whose enthusiasm is not mere excitement of animal spirits, and whose pluck and courage are given them to stand the roughnesses (such as they are) of a missionary life. For, dear Uncle, if you <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> any old pupil of yours about the work, don't let him suppose that it is consistent with ease and absence of anxiety and work. When on shore at Kohimarama, we live very cosily, as I think. Some might say we have no society, very simple fare, &c.; I don't think any man would really find it so. But in the islands, I don't wish to conceal from anyone that, measured by the rule of the English gentleman's household, there is a great difference. Why should it, however, be measured by this standard? I can truly say that we have hitherto always had what is necessary for health, and what does one need more? though I like more as much as anyone.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Don't you <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> {{me about}} any of your English watering-places and sea-port towns! No one knows {{anything}} about what an harbour can be for perfect beauty of earth, air, and sea, for wooded banks and rocky heights, and fine shipping and handsome buildings, and all the bustle and stir of a town of 80,000 inhabitants somehow lost and hidden among gum trees and Norfolk Island pines and parks and gravel walks; and everywhere the magnificent sea view breaking in upon the eye. Don't be angry, darling, for I love Dawlish very much, and would sooner go and sail the [...] "Mary Jane" [...] with you in some dear little basin among the rocks at low tide, and watch all the little crabs and other creatures with long Latin names, than walk about Sydney arm-in- arm with the Bishops of New Zealand and Newcastle, to call on the Governor. But I must say what I think about the natural scenery of places that I visit, and nowhere, even in New Zealand--no, not even in Queen Charlotte's Sound, nor in Banks's Peninsula, have I seen anything so completely beautiful as this harbour--'"heoi ano" [...] "that's enough." [...] The Governor told us yesterday {{that when he was}} at Hobart Town, he made the convicts cut a path through one of the deep gullies running down from a mountain 4,500 feet high to the sea. The path was two miles long, and all the way the tree-ferns, between twenty and thirty feet high, formed a natural roof arched and vaulted like the fretted roofs of our Tudor churches and chapels. There is a botanical garden here with a very good collection of all the Australian trees and shrubs, and with many New Zealand and many semi- tropical plants besides. All the English flowers and fruits grow here as well, so that in the warmer months it must look beautiful. It is close to the sea, which runs here in little creeks and bays close up among the public walks and buildings; and as the shore is all rocky and steep at low water, there is no mud or swamp or seaweed, but only clear green water quite deep and always calm and tranquil, because the harbour is so broken up and diversified by innumerable islets, gulfs, &c., that no wind can raise any sea of consequence in it.|$|E

May {{explained that he}} conceived the idea for this song while reading The White Goddess by Robert Graves.

In a later interview he said, [...] "I remember being totally in love with this girl from biology, and I never <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> her...I was dared to ask out this girl, and she became a lifelong friend, it's very strange...".|$|R
5000|$|The {{first use}} of the phrase [...] "Don't talk to me or my son ever again" [...] online was in a 2014 Tumblr post by user splendidland. The post showed red-colored text {{displaying}} the phrase over a screenshot of Spike Spiegel in the anime Cowboy Bebop next to a smaller-sized duplicate of the character. The [...] "son" [...] referred to the miniature of Spiegel. The post garnered approximately 6,300 notes as of March 2016. [...] The second Internet use of the meme was [...] "don’t you <b>EVER</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or my son that way again", in an August 2015 Tumblr post by konkeydongcountry, which depicted a picture of two Yoshi dolls of different sizes and the phrase. [...] In October 2015, a Twitter user under the name yoshibot used the phrase [...] "don't you <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me or my son again" [...] in a picture he posted showing two Yoshi costumes, one {{much bigger than the}} other one. This time, the word [...] "you" [...] was added and the word [...] "ever" [...] was removed.|$|E

40|$|In this episode, Chris Gaiser (professor {{of biology}} at Linfield College) and Mike Crosser (professor of physics at Linfield College) talk about solar and lunar eclipses: how they work, why they are infrequent, and why people should not look {{directly}} at the sun. This episode is all {{in preparation for the}} great solar eclipse on August 21, 2017, visible (at least in part) to most of North America. A special note from the Podcasters: Partial solar eclipses are amazing events. However, if you have the means to experience totality, you should take advantage of it. Anyone we have <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> who has experienced it became passionate about seeing another one...|$|R

50|$|Terry is an {{embalmer}} and is Dixie's father, who got {{her mother}} Sue pregnant {{while she was}} arranging her former boyfriend Jordan's funeral after Sue, miserable and unable to think straight, had a one-night stand with him. Terry has another family with a wife called Stella and three daughters which makes us infer that he cheated on that past family with sue. He does not really <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> Dixie or contact her, which makes you infer that this half of his family {{he wants to keep}} a secret from Stella and his other daughters; however, {{at the end of the}} book he visits Dixie in Hospital and says he wants to introduce her to her half-sisters.|$|E
5000|$|Stoops {{took time}} off {{from his job as}} a {{graduate}} assistant at Iowa to play as a replacement player for a limited time in 1987 with the Chicago Bears during the NFL strike. [...] Wearing #44, he played safety in three games with the Bears that year, suffering a concussion in an October 4 victory (35-3) against the Philadelphia Eagles. [...] Other former Iowa players who were members of the National Football League Players Association had harsh words for Stoops. He responded, [...] "I don't give a damn what they think. I wasn't trying to hurt anybody, and deep down, I think they know that. But if they feel that way, fine, don't <b>ever</b> <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> me again".|$|E
5000|$|On January 11, 2011, Hoke {{was named}} the 19th head {{football}} coach of the Michigan Wolverines football team. Michigan athletic director Dave Brandon described some {{of the factors that}} influenced his selection of Hoke: [...] "The reason I wanted him to be prominent in this process was simply the combination of turning around two programs, being known as a terrific recruiter, and being a defensive-minded coach with a lot of experience. Everybody that I <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> just raved about the quality of person he is and how much he loves Michigan." [...] Although many speculated that Hoke had been a third choice behind Jim Harbaugh and Les Miles, Brandon stated, [...] "The job was never offered to them." ...|$|R
60|$|One habit Bellingham had {{developed}} of late which Smith {{knew to be}} a frequent herald of a weakening mind. He appeared <b>to</b> be for <b>ever</b> <b>talking</b> <b>to</b> himself. At late hours of the night, when {{there could be no}} visitor with him, Smith could still hear his voice beneath him in a low, muffled monologue, sunk almost to a whisper, and yet very audible in the silence. This solitary babbling annoyed and distracted the student, so that he spoke more than once to his neighbour about it. Bellingham, however, flushed up at the charge, and denied curtly that he had uttered a sound; indeed, he showed more annoyance over the matter than the occasion seemed to demand.|$|R
6000|$|It must be {{believed}} that Mills was right. Monsieur George fell asleep {{before he could}} feel any pang at that intelligence. A sort of confused surprise was in his mind but nothing else, and then his eyes closed. The awakening was another matter. But that, too, Mills had foreseen. For days he attended the bedside patiently letting {{the man in the}} bed <b>talk</b> <b>to</b> him of Doña Rita but saying little himself; till one day he was asked pointedly whether she had <b>ever</b> <b>talked</b> <b>to</b> him openly. And then he said that she had, on more than one occasion. “She told me amongst other things,” Mills said, “if this is any satisfaction to you to know, that till she met you she knew nothing of love. That you were to her in more senses than one a complete revelation.” ...|$|R
