50|$|Formal {{psychological}} evaluation {{consists of}} standardized batteries of tests and highly structured clinician-run interviews, while <b>informal</b> <b>evaluation</b> {{takes on a}} completely different tone. In <b>informal</b> <b>evaluation,</b> assessments are based on unstructured, free-flowing interviews or observations that allow both {{the patient and the}} clinician to guide the content. Both of these methods have their pros and cons. A highly unstructured interview and informal observations provide key findings about the patient that are both efficient and effective. A potential issue with an unstructured, informal approach is the clinician may overlook certain areas of functioning or not notice them at all. Or they might focus too much on presenting complaints. The highly structured interview, although very precise, can cause the clinician to make the mistake of focusing a specific answer to a specific question without considering the response in terms of a broader scope or life context. They may fail to recognize how the patient's answers all fit together.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Recent {{years have}} seen an {{explosion}} in online collaborative tagging, the most prevalent visualization of which are tag clouds. Despite their popularity, tag clouds suffer from limitations of separation from tagged items, lack of relational information between tags and a less-than-fully interactive experience. In this paper we introduce Tagscape, a tag system interface that attempts to address these issues. Tagscape uses a magnet analogy to represent relationships between tags and tagged items as attractions and repulsions. Preliminary <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the interface were positive and revealed avenues for future work. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{debate on}} how to measure the value of IT is an ongoing debate within the IT {{evaluation}} research. Research {{about the value of}} IT tends to focus on formal aspects and ignore informal aspects such as the subjective perceptions of individuals and researchers acknowledge a lack of <b>informal</b> <b>evaluation</b> methods used in practice. This study aims to answer two research questions: How can informal value of IS be evaluated? and What are the benefits and drawbacks of relying on informal value when assessing IS? To answer these questions a qualitative case study have been conducted using the DeLone & McLean IS Success Model as a theoretical framework. The results show that using the model was successful however we argue that important aspects were missing in the model. The benefits of relying on informal value showed to be the possibilities of discovering aspects of value that are not visible in formal evaluation. The drawbacks of performing an <b>informal</b> <b>evaluation</b> are that they are complicated and time-consuming and do not promise useful results. ...|$|E

40|$|This paper treats {{design of}} the built {{environment}} as a decision process and asserts {{the need for a}} more objective base for design decisions. A conceptual review of the designer's problem acknowledges the difficulty of resolving multiple objectives and considers the nature of the information available to the decisionmaker. The designer's formal design evaluation is related to the <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the eventual users of his product. Users' responses are physiological, behavioural, and attitudinal. It is argued that the accumulating understanding of attitudinal responses to the built environment constitutes a potentially valuable information base for the designer's own evaluative decisions. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} we {{introduce}} a new user interface design that maps sensed emotions to an abstract device. This abstract display allows the exploring of emotional expressions avoiding anthropomorphisms caused by human or animal like designs. The presented interface senses emotions by facial video analysis. The device is implemented as an actuated surface that expresses emotions by changing its physical attributes. This change is triggered by sensed emotions via a behavioral mapping. The surface design, including texture, form of expression and dynamics, {{is a result of}} an iterative design process involving interdisciplinary participants. Finally, results of <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> of the device during audience exhibits are presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Despite its {{inclusion}} in prescriptions that are offered for successful change {{management and the}} benefits this could bring, it is widely recognised that systematic, planned evaluation of initiatives rarely takes place. On {{the basis of the}} findings from qualitative case study research undertaken in the public sector, this article explores both the rhetoric, as represented by the literature, and the reality of evaluation in the context of three change initiatives. What emerges is the importance of <b>informal,</b> personal <b>evaluation</b> which appears both to negate the need and to act as a replacement for systematic planned evaluation for the management group. Equally significant is the evidence of <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> occurring at every level of the organisation that were not recognised by management as important [...] and which were being neither captured nor shared, other than in a very restricted sense. Consequently, decisions were being {{made on the basis of}} an assumed reality that did not necessarily reflect the experience of those affected by the change. Rather than emphasising the need for planned, systematic evaluation processes for change initiatives, it is suggested that inclusion of approaches that facilitate recognition and sharing of perception and experience across group boundaries may be more acceptable and productive...|$|R

40|$|Patients {{typically}} undergo physiotherapy {{with the}} help of a physiotherapist who teaches, guides, and corrects the patients as they perform exercises. It would be nice if people could repeat these exercises at home, potentially improving their recovery rate. However, without guidance and/or corrective feedback from a physiotherapist, the patient will not know whether they are doing their exercises correctly. To address this problem, we implemented a prototype that guides patients through pre-recorded exercise movements using visual guides overlaid atop a mirror-view of the patient on a wall-mounted display. We conducted <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> and pilot studies to assess our prototype and identified some working designs and design characteristics.

A systematic exploration of the possible composition and design space is leading to music that communicates the dynamic aspects of the exhibit (e. g., how many fish, what kinds, where they are, what they are doing), as well as conveying the emotional content (e. g., amazement and wonder at the massive whale shark gliding by). <b>Informal</b> <b>evaluations</b> have been very successful; formal evaluations are ongoing. 1...|$|R

50|$|Goal Attainment Scaling (GAS) is a {{therapeutic}} method {{that refers to}} the development of a written follow-up guide between the client and the counselor used for monitoring client progress. GAS was first developed by Thomas Kiresuk and Robert Sherman in response to the wide variety of evaluation models regarding mental illness and treatment. With the advent of GAS, Kiresuk and Sherman sought to create an evaluation program that could measure effectiveness across several different modalities and justify economic and labor resources based on effectiveness. Evaluation practices are important for justification and support for services, especially in mental health. The existing evaluation procedures had problems in definition and measurement, and each mental health center used its own definitions and measurements to evaluate. This created unspecified and <b>informal</b> <b>evaluations.</b> The variety of evaluation methods also made comparisons impossible. Thus, evaluation reform was needed.|$|R
