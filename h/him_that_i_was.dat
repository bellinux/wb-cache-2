25|$|When I {{became a}} member of the law firm of Steger, Thurmond and Rayburn, Messrs. Thurmond and Steger were {{representing}} the Santa Fe Railroad Company, receiving pay monthly. When the first check came after I entered the firm, Mr. Thurmond brought to my desk one-third of the amount of the check, explaining what it was for. I said to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> a member of the Legislature, representing the people of Fannin County, and that my experience had taught me that men who represent the people should be as far removed as possible from concerns whose interests he was liable to be called on to legislate concerning, and that on that ground I would not accept a dollar of the railroad's money, though I was legally entitled to it. I never did take a dollar of it. I have been guided by the principle in all my dealings.|$|E
500|$|Despite {{her history}} with Colin, the {{character}} happily pursued {{a romantic relationship}} with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman). Speaking about the relationship, Francis stated: [...] "I would like {{to continue to work}} with him because he is just so good, and Peter is so nice. I did do a couple scenes with <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really proud of, and they were right before the two of them make love for the first time. There were two scenes where Genevieve bares her soul to him. [...] And through that, the audience hopefully got more insight into who this woman really is." ...|$|E
500|$|However, {{she became}} {{dissatisfied}} with Cochrane, who was openly committing adultery and constantly insulting Gardnerians, even {{at one point}} calling for [...] "a Night of the Long Knives of the Gardnerians", at which point Valiente openly criticised him and then left his Clan. In her own words, she [...] "rose up and challenged him {{in the presence of}} the rest of the coven. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> fed up with listening to all this senseless malice, and that, if a 'Night of the Long Knives' was what his sick little soul craved, he could get on with it, but he could get on with it alone, because I had better things to do". Shortly after, Cochrane committed ritual suicide on Midsummer 1966; she authored the poem [...] "Elegy for a Dead Witch" [...] in his memory. She remained in contact with his widow and other members of the Clan, as well as with Gray, and proceeded to work on occasion with The Regency, a group founded by former members of the Clan.|$|E

500|$|There was a {{backlash}} in India, which forced Gilchrist to clarify his position. Gilchrist later {{insisted that he}} did not accuse Tendulkar of lying in his testimony. He also denied calling the Indian a [...] "bad sport" [...] in regards to the handshake issue. Tendulkar responded by saying that [...] "those remarks came from someone who doesn't know me enough. I think he made loose statements...I reminded <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> the first person to shake hands after the Sydney defeat." [...] The autobiography also blamed the ICC for allowing Sri Lankan cricketer Muralitharan to bowl; Gilchrist believes that ICC changed the throwing law to legitimise a bowling action that he regards as illegitimate. The law change was described as [...] "a load of horse crap. That's rubbish." [...] Gilchrist claimed that Muralitharan threw the ball and alleged that the ICC protected him because Sri Lankan cricket authorities portrayed any criticism of the bowler's legitimacy as racism and a witchhunt conducted by whites. In response to these comments, former Sri Lankan captain Marvan Atapattu said that by questioning the credentials of players like Muralitharan and Tendulkar, Gilchrist had done no good to his own reputation.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the cast}} was not happy with Fincher's {{exacting}} ways and perfectionism. Some scenes required upwards of 70 takes. [...] Gyllenhaal was frustrated by the director's methods and commented in an interview, [...] "You get a take, 5 takes, 10 takes. Some places, 90 takes. But there is a stopping point. There's {{a point at which}} you go, 'That's what we have to work with.' But we would reshoot things. So there came a point where I would say, well, what do I do? Where's the risk?" [...] Downey said, [...] "I just decided, aside from several times I wanted to garrote <b>him,</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to give him what he wanted. I think I'm a perfect person to work for him, because I understand gulags". Fincher responded, [...] "If an actor is going to let the role come to them, they can't resent the fact that I'm willing to wait as long as that takes. You know, the first day of production in San Francisco we shot 56 takes of Mark and Jake – and it's the 56th take that's in the movie". Ruffalo also backed up his director's methods when he said, [...] "The way I see it is, you enter into someone else's world as an actor. You can put your expectations aside and have an experience that's new and pushes and changes you, or hold on to what you think it should be and have a stubborn, immovable journey that's filled with disappointment and anger." ...|$|E
2500|$|After being {{informed}} by intercom that a hijacking was in progress, Captain Uri Bar Lev {{decided not to}} accede to their demands:"I decided {{that we were not}} going to be hijacked. The security guy was sitting here ready to jump. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to put the plane into negative-G mode. Everyone would fall. When you put the plane into negative, it's like being in a falling elevator. Instead of the plane flying this way, it dives and everyone who is standing falls down." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Some day <b>I</b> {{will show}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> {{as good a}} man as he," [...] he muttered to himself. [...] "An evil-hearted dog to put shame upon me!" ...|$|R
2500|$|While at a {{cocktail}} party, Dziubinska met the actor Sir John Mills. She is quoted as saying, 'I adored Hayley, so I went over {{to talk to him}} about my favourite film of all time, Whistle Down The Wind, which I've seen four million times. I said to <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> an actress and that I'd been acting since I was at school and then I asked him if he had any advice, and he said, 'do everything you're offered, because everything you do will give you some experience!' The first thing I was offered the next day was Vampyres!' ...|$|E
2500|$|Former Oakland A's manager Art Howe (Hoffman) {{has spoken}} out {{publicly}} about his disapproval {{of how he}} was portrayed in the film. The story shows Howe as a stubborn manager who, contrary to Beane's wishes, refused to use Bradford out of the bullpen or to start Hatteberg at first base. In fact, Bradford was used regularly out of the bullpen in early 2002, {{just as he had}} been in 2001, when he logged 75 innings primarily as a late reliever or set-up man for Billy Koch, the A's primary closer. Scott Hatteberg has also stated publicly that Howe was portrayed inaccurately. He is quoted in an interview as saying, [...] "Art Howe was a huge supporter of mine. I never got the impression from <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> not his first choice." [...] Later in the interview, Hatteberg mentions that [...] "there was that turbulent relationship" [...] between Howe and Beane.|$|E
2500|$|Later in 1990, Alexandru Stefu (another {{old friend}} from Romania) invited Comăneci and Panait to Montreal, {{where he was}} staying {{with his family and}} Béla Károlyi. Comăneci noted in her memoir that after they arrived in Montreal, andwhen he finally had an {{opportunity}} to get me alone, Alexandru asked what was next for me. I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> thinking about staying in Montreal, but hadn't yet mentioned the idea to [...] because he'd already booked us on a flight back to Los Angeles. The next day, Alexandru sent me to meet with the director of the Olympic stadium, who told me that I could do some exhibitions and appearances for him [...] When I woke up the next morning and went downstairs, Alexandru told me that [...] was gone. I never heard from him again, but I hope he is well and thank him for his help. I realize that our business relationship may have tarnished my name and image, but I safely escaped from Romania, and that is truly what was most important. There wasn't too much time to figure out why [...] had left because very soon after his departure, CNN contacted me.|$|E

60|$|On the {{following}} morning I {{had a conversation with}} Indaba-zimbi. First of all I told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> going to marry Stella.|$|E

60|$|In {{an instant}} I was white with jealousy, {{but only for}} an instant; since Dian quickly drew the man toward me, telling <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> David, her mate.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> averse to marriage; in truth, that will <b>be</b> no falsehood. <b>I</b> {{do not think}} that my heart is capable of more love than it feels at present." ...|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} so imperative and masterful about <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> quite beside myself—“rattled,” as Furuseth would have termed it, like a quaking child before a stern school-master.|$|E
60|$|Now I {{think that}} {{something}} which {{he saw in}} my eye showed <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> in earnest. At least, he changed his tone and began to argue, almost to plead.|$|E
60|$|Something {{seemed to}} startle him--something {{in my voice}} perhaps which told <b>him</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> really distressed. He looked round at me quickly, and caught me with the tears in my eyes.|$|E
