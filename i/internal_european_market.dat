40|$|This book {{is borne}} {{out of the}} {{observation}} of a certain gap in the legal literature on the <b>European</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> which has traditionally focused on substantive issues - such as the content and {{the scope of the}} rules on free movement, including adjacent policies such as State aid control - and on their impact on the allocation of powers between the European institutions and Member States. Little attention has been devoted {{to the way in which}} these rules shape the administrative institutions in charge of securing the internal market. This is, precisely, the subject of this book. The book builds on the notion of "European administrative union" and, hence, on an understanding of the European administration as a sum of institutions, bodies or agencies - both European and national - which act cooperatively. It is against this complex reality that the different chapters of the book scrutinize the organizational and procedural specificities of the different public administrations that interact in the internal market. Some chapters address these issues from a cross-sector perspective (e. g., the studies on the public administration associated to the four fundamental freedoms or the study on independent regulatory authorities) while others do so from a sector-specific perspective (e. g., the studies on the banking union, the European system of State aid control, the European networks of competition and food authorities, or the administrative implications of public procurement rules). The combination of both perspectives provides new insights into the administrative dimension of the internal market.

40|$|One of the {{important}} goals of European energy policy {{is to increase the}} share of renewable energy resources in the energy supply. The instruments used in the member states are not fully compatible with the rules of the European internal market. In a theoretical section, this paper analyses possible different instruments for promoting renewable energy. Some countries use feed in tariffs - using fixed prices to increase incentives for producers to invest into renewable energy, other countries use quantity-based systems like quotas that lead to a premium above the market price. In an institutional analysis we show that on the basis of effectiveness and efficiency considerations for the European Union, in the long-term quantity oriented systems of promotion are preferable if combined with elements of a capacity market. The main reason for this conclusion is that price-based systems cannot give enough incentives for backup capacities necessary to cope with intermittent production of renewable sources. In addition price-based systems violate the basic rules of the open <b>internal</b> <b>European</b> <b>market</b> because feed in tariffs are a considerable barrier for trade of renewable energy products...|$|E

Consumers were not getting enough benefit from the <b>internal</b> <b>European</b> <b>market.</b> Now that deregulation has come into effect, the dynamics in the sales and servicing markets have increased. Due to these changes, market players in the brand distribution chain face a lot of uncertainty and competitive complexity. This article describes: 1) the key issues arising from Monti's regulation; 2) the effects on market dynamics; and 3) the main strategic implications for an importer of cars and parts in The Netherlands, particularly in its relationship with its dealers. Using the Theory of Dynamic Capabilities, this article shows that continuously building on new knowledge, the proactive development of new concepts in pilot environments, and building strong relationships with players in a broader automotive environment, are key success factors in maintaining the competitive advantage in highly dynamic markets. © 2005 Elservier Ltd.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to propose a new {{framework}} to assess the impact of Court of Justice of the EU (CJEU) jurisprudence on the construction of a <b>European</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market,</b> by considering whether the jurisprudence of the Court on corporate taxation fulfils the mandate set out in the European Treaties for establishing such a market. It is shown that the Court’s focus upon removing discriminatory obstacles to the fundamental freedoms does not necessarily lead to a more level playing-field and increased tax neutrality, an instrumental objective towards attaining a <b>European</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market.</b> In order to assess the impact of the jurisprudence of the Court upon neutrality and a level playing-field, the decision in Lankhorst-Hohorst, regarding the compatibility of thin capitalisation rules with free movement provisions, will be used as case study. An economic analysis demonstrates that, depending on the reaction of Member States to the ruling, tax induced differences in capital costs faced by firms operating within the <b>European</b> <b>internal</b> <b>market</b> may increase, while GDP and welfare may decrease. Consideration of actual legislative amendments introduced to thin capitalisation rules by Member States following Lankhorst-Hohorst appear to indicate that it is this negative scenario which has prevailed.

Based on a sample of 13, 911 M&A attempts worldwide during 1986 - 2006, this study provides an analysis of major determinants of M&A completion in the food processing industry. Friendly attitude, cash payment and experience with M&As emerge as strong deal facilitators. Bidding competition, pursuit of parallel transactions, target subsidiary status and acquirer public status {{are the most important}} deal breakers. Unlike the lenient antitrust approach of the Reagan administration, the 1998 UK Competition Act and various directives and regulations on food safety and quality associated with the completion of the <b>internal</b> <b>European</b> <b>market</b> in 1992 facilitated M&A completion. In contrast, the beginning of the Economic and Monetary Union, as marked by the introduction of the Euro in 1999, had a strong negative effect on completion likelihood.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a comparative study on auditor responsibility within two members of the European Union: Germany and the Netherlands. Auditor responsibility {{is an important factor in}} establishing audit quality. The quality of service within the auditing profession is maintained through the promulgation of professional standards and disciplinary law. In Germany, the Wirtschaftspruferkammer is the supervisory body which oversees compliance with standards and professional duties. In the Netherlands, a special court (Raad van Tucht) is concerned with disciplinary actions against auditors. The results of this study show that the disciplinary laws, regulations and professional codes remain basically national, despite efforts to harmonize auditing to meet an increased demand for international audits. This study identifies characteristics of disciplinary systems common to both countries and provides information on the functioning of both systems that may be useful in a number of ways. The results presented might initiate a more systematic comparison of disciplinary systems within members of the European Union, which would enhance institutional knowledge of the European market for auditing services. This in turn could promote the process of further integration of the <b>internal</b> <b>European</b> <b>market</b> and reduce market inefficiencies. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{harmonization}} {{and integration}} of separate national energy markets to an interconnected <b>internal</b> <b>European</b> <b>market</b> is a top priority of the European Commission. However, as energy policy largely remains subject to national sovereignty, {{a higher degree of}} integration can cause unilateral national policies to harm interconnected markets. We investigate the impact of two distinct national reforms in Germany - the phase-out of nuclear power plants after the Fukushima incident and the expansion of renewables promoted by fixed feed-in tariffs and unlimited priority feed-in - on neighbouring countries. We find that the phase-out triggered price increases of up to 19 percent in neighbouring countries whilst the renewable energy support schemes caused a price decrease of up to 0. 17 percent for each percent of additional generation from German renewables. We also apply a novel approach to estimate the degree of market integration and find large differences between neighbouring countries in a range from 14 percent to 99 percent. Our findings point up the need for increased efforts to harmonize national energy policies, but also the need to consider the impact of unilateral environmental measures on other countries' supplies {{in the context of a}} partially integrated and partly unilateral system...|$|E
