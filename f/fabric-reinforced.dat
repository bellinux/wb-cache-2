40|$|ABSTRACT: This paper {{describes}} {{the development of}} a finite element model and a closed-form model for studying viscoelastic damping in woven <b>fabric-reinforced</b> polymer matrix composites. The finite element model was based on the actual geometric configura-tion of a plain weave <b>fabric-reinforced</b> composite unit cell, and the damping loss factors were determined from a strain energy formulation. The closed-form model was developed by first deriving an approximate elastic solution based on the mechanics of materials the-ory, then applying the Elastic-Viscoelastic Correspondence Principle to the elastic solu-tion. The damping loss factors were then determined from the viscoelastic solution. Experi-ments were conducted using an impulse-frequency response technique to measure damping in beam samples made of plain weave E-glass <b>fabric-reinforced</b> vinyl ester resin matrix composite. The predictions from both analytical models show reasonably good agreement with experimental data...|$|E

To this end, a study {{has been carried out}} to investigate the inelastic behaviour of both plain and <b>fabric-reinforced</b> concrete GFS. The results of the study on plain-concrete GFS were reported in the first of a set of two papers, while the present, second paper is devoted to the research work carried out on <b>fabric-reinforced</b> concrete slabs. Both papers aim at advancing the understanding of the behaviour of these slabs by means of non-linear finite-element analysis (NLFEA) that employs a constitutive model which is based on experimental data on concrete behaviour under triaxial states of stress. Similarly to the findings for the plain-concrete GFS, and with design rationale in mind, a new performance-based (PB) definition for the failure criterion is also proposed for <b>fabric-reinforced</b> GFS, which takes into account the all-important slope condition (i. e. the effect of structural loading on flatness and levelness of the slab). Finally, NLFEA-based design recommendations are made on the effect of the steel reinforcement on the strength and serviceability of <b>fabric-reinforced</b> GFS, including also recommendations on the appropriate location (i. e. top or bottom) of the steel in order to achieve a balanced strength throughout the slab.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The present work {{addresses}} the processing parameters, methodology, {{and limitations of}} {{vacuum assisted resin transfer}} molding (VARTM) of carbon <b>fabric-reinforced</b> thermoplastic polyamide 6 (PA 6) matrix panels on the laboratory scale. VARTM is a mature technology for producing large-scale thermoset composite parts/structures but has not been used for thermoplastic composites, which are manufactured primarily by compression molding, extrusion, and/or injection molding. In general, liquid molding of thermoplastics has limitations, such as high resin viscosity, high temperature processing requirements, and a short processing window. The materials used in this study are casting grade PA 6, "-caprolactam with a sodium-based catalyst, and an initiator. This system allows the resin to maintain a very low viscosity (< 1 Pa s) for a reasonable period of time, at relatively low temperatures (100 C). The carbon fabric preform is infused using VARTM after which the resin is fully polymerized in situ. The process developed for using VARTM to produce carbon <b>fabric-reinforced</b> PA 6 matrix composites is explained in detail. Microscopic studies are presented to evaluate wet-out of th...|$|E

In this study, numerical methods to generate and simulate mechanical properties of flax short fibre-reinforced and flax fibre <b>fabric-reinforced</b> polymer composites are proposed. The microstructures of {{short flax fibres}} with different fibre length-to-diameter ratios are generated by algorithm taking fiber defects (e. g. kink band) and fiber bundles into account. Bidirectional flax fabric is generated and discretized by tetrahedron 4 -node finite elements. A brittle material law for fibre defects and interfacial zones of fibre bundles is proposed. Flax short fibre/polypropylene and flax fabric/epoxy composites are modeled by a non-linear plasticity model considering an isotropic hardening law and non-local continuum damage mechanics. The numerical modelling results are compared with the experimental results of these composites. This study shows that the simulation can capture the main damage mechanisms of the composites such as fibre breakage initiated at the fiber defects, damage of polymer matrix and the fibre debonding at fibre/matrix interface accurately.

Recently, jute fibre is being used as reinforcement material in the development of reinforced plastics for various engin-eering products. The production cycle of a composite product often necessitates certain degree of machining operations. Drilling {{is one of the most}} widely practised machining operation for making holes in composite laminates. Hole making is imperative to ascertain the assembly of intricate composite products. The literature available indicate that not much research work has been reported on the machining behaviour of jute fibre-reinforced polypropylene composites. Hence, in the present experimental endeavour, drilling of woven jute <b>fabric-reinforced</b> polypropylene composite has been performed. The effect of operating variables on thrust force and torque signals was investigated. Drilling-induced damage in the developed composite was quantified using stereo microscope. The experimental values indicate close relationship between the tool geometries and the delamination factor. SEM analysis was also conducted to understand the drilling behaviour and surface morphology of the drilled holes. Among the solid drills compared, parabolic drill reveals better cutting behaviour in terms of lower drilling forces and better quality of holes.

40|$|Ultra-high {{molecular}} weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fibres have {{high tensile strength}} (approaching 4 GPa), high elastic modulus (about 130 GPa), and low density (970 kg/m 3), which provide enhanced capacity to absorb energy and resist penetration under impact loading. For protection against impact threats, these fibres are most commonly used {{in the form of}} non-woven composite laminates comprising unidirectional plies of collimated fibres embedded in polyurethane or rubber matrices. However, there is a paucity of data on the impact behaviour of woven fabrics and <b>fabric-reinforced</b> composite laminates made of these fibres. Therefore, this thesis aims to investigate the penetration and failure mechanisms of UHMWPE woven fabrics and <b>fabric-reinforced</b> composite laminates and identify the effects of several important factors. The tensile properties of UHMWPE single yarns were tested at various strain rates from 3. 3 × 10 - 5 to 400 s- 1. A transition from ductile to brittle failure of yarns was observed as the strain rate increased. It was found that the tensile strength and Young’s modulus increased while the failure strain and toughness decreased with strain rate at low strain rates (below 0. 33 s- 1). However, these tensile properties were almost insensitive to strain rate at higher strain rates. The strength of yarns followed the 2 -parameter Weibull distribution at all strain rates studied. The impact behaviour of multi-ply woven fabrics was studied by means of impact testing and finite element modelling. The effect of fabric folding was investigated for the first time by comparing the impact performance of unfolded fabrics, accordion-fold fabrics, and roll-fold fabrics. The results showed that the perforation resistance and energy absorption capacity were significantly improved by folding a fabric into multiple plies compared to the unfolded counterparts, and the roll-fold fabrics performed best. ii The impact behaviour of woven <b>fabric-reinforced</b> composite laminates with four different resins was experimentally investigated. The laminates having flexible matrices performed better in perforation resistance and energy absorption, but had a larger extent of deformation and damage than the counterparts made of rigid matrices.

However its use is largely restricted by inefficient production and by insufficient strength when {{it is in a}} highly swollen state. In this study, a fabric skeleton reinforced chitosan (CS) /BNC hydrogel with high mechanical reliability and antibacterial activity was fabricated by using an efficient dynamic culture that could reserve the nano-fibrillar structure. By adding CS in culture media to 0. 25 - 0. 75 % (w/v) during bacterial cultivation, the CS/BNC composite hydrogel was biosynthesized in situ on a rotating drum composed of fabrics. With the proposed method, BNC biosynthesis became less sensitive to the adverse antibacterial effects of CS and the production time of the composite hydrogel with desirable thickness could be halved from 10 days to 5 days as compared to the conventional static cultures. Although its concentration was low in the medium, CS accounted for more than 38 % of the CS/BNC dry weight. FE-SEM observation confirmed conservation of the nano-fibrillar networks and covering of CS on BNC. ATR-FTIR showed a decrease in the degree of intra-molecular hydrogen bonding and water absorption capacity was improved after compositing with CS.
