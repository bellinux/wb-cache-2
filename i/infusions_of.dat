5|$|Peregrine falcons {{have been}} {{successfully}} bred in captivity, both for falconry and for release back into the wild.

Peregrine falcons {{were removed from the}} United States' endangered species list in 1999. The successful recovery program was aided by the effort and knowledge of falconers – in collaboration with The Peregrine Fund and state and federal agencies – through a technique called hacking. Finally, after years of close work with the US Fish and Wildlife Service, a limited take of wild peregrines was allowed in 2004, the first wild peregrines taken specifically for falconry in over 30 years.|$|E
5|$|The Haflinger, {{also known}} as the Avelignese, is a breed of horse {{developed}} in Austria and northern Italy (namely Hafling in South Tyrol region) during the late nineteenth century. Haflinger horses are relatively small, are always chestnut in color, have distinctive gaits described as energetic but smooth, and are well-muscled yet elegant. The breed traces its ancestry to the Middle Ages; there are several theories for its origin. Haflingers, developed for use in mountainous terrain, are known for their hardiness. Their current conformation and appearance are the result of <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> bloodlines from Arabian and various European breeds into the original native Tyrolean ponies. The foundation sire, 249 Folie, was born in 1874; by 1904 the first breeders' cooperative was formed. All Haflingers can trace their lineage back to Folie through one of seven bloodlines. World Wars I and II, as well as the Great Depression, had a detrimental effect on the breed, and lower-quality animals were used at times to save the breed from extinction. During World War II, breeders focused on horses that were shorter and more draft-like, favored by the military for use as packhorses. The emphasis after the war shifted toward animals of increased refinement and height.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{their ancient}} history, all living Andalusians trace {{to a small}} number of horses bred by {{religious}} orders in the 18th and 19thcenturies. An influx of heavy horse blood beginning in the 16th century, resulted in the dilution of many of the bloodlines; only those protected by selective breeding remained intact to become the modern Andalusian. During the 19th century, the Andalusian breed was threatened because many horses were stolen or requisitioned in wartime, including the War of the Oranges, the Peninsular War and the three Carlist Wars. Napoleon's invading army also stole many horses. One herd of Andalusians was hidden from the invaders however, and subsequently used to renew the breed. In 1822, breeders began to add Norman blood into Spanish bloodlines, as well as further <b>infusions</b> <b>of</b> Arabian blood. This was partially because increasing mechanization and changing needs within the military called for horses with more speed in cavalry charges as well as horses with more bulk for pulling gun carriages. In 1832, an epidemic seriously affected Spain's horse population, from which only one small herd survived in a stud at the monastery in Cartuja. During the 19th and early 20th centuries, European breeders, especially the Germans, changed from an emphasis on Andalusian and Neapolitan horses (an emphasis that had been in place since the decline of chivalry), to an emphasis on the breeding of Thoroughbreds and warmbloods, further depleting the stock of Andalusians. Despite this change in focus, Andalusian breeding slowly recovered, and in 1869, the Seville Horse Fair (originally begun by the Romans), played host to between ten and twelve thousand Spanish horses. In the early 20th century, Spanish horse breeding began to focus on other breeds, particularly draft breeds, Arabians, Thoroughbreds and crosses between these breeds, as well as crosses between these breeds and the Andalusian. The purebred Andalusian was not viewed favorably by breeders or the military, and their numbers decreased significantly.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Nonocclusive {{mesenteric}} ischemia (NOMI) {{after surgery}} has an extremely poor prognosis with a mortality rate of 30 – 100 %. We report {{a patient with}} NOMI following aortic valve replacement who failed to improve despite continuous intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> papaverine, but was successfully treated with alprostadil (prostaglandin E 1 [PGE 1]) <b>infusion.</b> Presentation <b>of</b> case: The patient is a 77 -year-old man who underwent aortic valve replacement. Due to elevated serum lactate levels five hours after intensive care unit admission, superior mesenteric arteriography was performed, establishing the diagnosis of NOMI. Although continuous intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> papaverine was begun, lactate levels remained elevated. Repeat angiography and laparotomy revealed extensive ischemic changes of the intestine. The vasodilator was changed to PGE 1, which improved arterial spasm. The patient ultimately needed an ileocecal resection, but {{the extent of the}} resection was limited with concomitant PGE 1 administration. Discussion: In the present patient, although NOMI was unresponsive to appropriate treatment including intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> papaverine, continuous intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> PGE 1 salvaged most of the intestine. Conclusions: In a patient with recurrent NOMI despite appropriate treatment including intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> papaverine, continuous intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> PGE 1 may limit the extent of intestinal resection needed. Continuous intra-arterial <b>infusion</b> <b>of</b> PGE 1 may be a useful treatment for patients with refractory NOMI...|$|R
