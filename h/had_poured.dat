5|$|On 5 August 1999, a Haringey social worker, Barry Almeida, took Climbié to an NSPCC centre in Tottenham, {{where she}} was {{assigned}} to Sylvia Henry. There was some confusion {{as to why the}} centre was being referred to for the case. Henry later contacted Almeida and was told, according to Henry, that Climbié had moved out of the borough, thereby closing the case. Almeida said he could not remember whether this conversation did take place. On the same day, Kouao met Arthurworrey and Jones at the Haringey social services department, and claimed that Climbié <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> boiling water over herself to stop the itching caused by the scabies and that she had used utensils to cause the other injuries. The social worker and police officer believed her, deciding that the injuries were probably accidental, and allowed Climbié to return home the following day, which she did.|$|E
5|$|Yusef first appears when Afia {{introduces}} him to {{her boyfriend}} Tamwar Masood (Himesh Patel). Tamwar feels he {{is not good enough}} for Afia in Yusef's eyes as he is from a poor background, but Yusef says that does not matter and approves of Tamwar. After Tamwar mentions his mother Zainab Masood's name, Yusef visits the Masood home and finds the door open. When Zainab sees him, she screams and orders him out. It is revealed they were husband and wife from an arranged marriage when Yusef was 17, and Yusef's family <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> oil on her and set her on fire. Yusef says it was his family, not him, and he attempted to save her, revealing bad scarring on his body. Tamwar's father Masood Ahmed, Tamwar and Afia return home, and Masood attacks Yusef, punching him twice. After Yusef returns, Tamwar asks Masood to speak to Yusef, and when he visits, he finds out Tamwar and Afia are still seeing each other. He gives his blessing for them to be married.|$|E
25|$|On July 2, 2009, U.S. Marines, {{simultaneously}} with the British, launched a massive offensive, dubbed Operation Khanjar, {{in hopes of}} securing the province for the Afghanistan presidential elections coming up, as well as turning the tide of the insurgency. In the months preceding the operation, 11,000 U.S. Marines <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> into the province as part of President Obama's troop surge.|$|E

25|$|At {{the date}} of my visit, the volcano <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> out, for five months continuously, a stream of lava on the Legaspi side from the very summit. The viscid mass bubbled quietly but grandly, and overran {{the border of the}} crater, {{descending}} several hundred feet in a glowing wave, like red-hot iron. Gradually, fading as the upper surface cooled, it changed to a thousand sparkling rills among the crevices, and, as it passed beyond the line of complete vision behind the woods near the base, the fires twinkled like stars, or the scintillions of a dying conflagration. More than half of the mountain height was thus illuminated.|$|E
25|$|Featherston {{continues}} to lose more ground into 1944, losing northern Georgia, and {{large parts of}} South Carolina and Alabama. A coup attempt by Nathan Bedford Forrest III shakes his confidence in his men, and he begins to lose his grip on reality. Even then, he believes {{that he will be}} able to get his way through the use of superbombs, a technology he <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> everything he could into upon realizing the war would not be short. Shortly after Germany uses the first superbomb in warfare against Petrograd, the only Confederate superbomb is set off in Philadelphia, by General Potter. However, the bomb detonates on the outskirts of the city west of the Schuylkill River and doesn't affect any US Government buildings.|$|E
25|$|The first {{effort to}} sink the Ciudad de Barcelona had been {{attempted}} in January 1937, but the torpedo had malfunctioned. On Saturday 29 May 1937, some 200–250 international volunteers boarded {{the ship in}} Marseille. They were mainly from North America, Great Britain, Germany and Italy, but some came from Scandinavia, Australia and New Zealand. There was also a group of French pilots and Senegalese passengers. Ciudad de Barcelona was intended to sail to Barcelona or Valencia, depending on situation of the armed conflict between the communists and anarchists in Barcelona. The ship had a cargo of war material, including items like tanks, tires, motorcycles, cotton fabrics and canned food. A day before, the ship's cargo of flour was sabotaged as someone <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> kerosene upon it. She was {{under the command of}} captain Francisco Nadal.|$|E

Most of the food stores were looted by the soldiers. Menéndez found five or six thousand ducats' worth of silver, largely ore, part of it brought by the Indians from the Appalachian Mountains, and part collected by Laudonnière from Outina, from whom he had also obtained some gold and pearls. Most of the artillery and ammunition brought over by Ribault had not been landed, and as Laudonnière had traded his with Hawkins for the ship, little was captured.|$|E
500|$|On 7 February 1979, {{just five}} days after Vicious's death, {{hearings}} began in London on Lydon's lawsuit. Cook and Jones were allied with McLaren, but as evidence mounted that their manager <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> {{virtually all of the}} band's revenue into his beloved film project, they switched sides. On 14 February, the court put the film and its soundtrack into receivership—no longer under McLaren's control, they were now to be administered as exploitable assets for addressing the band members' financial claims. McLaren, with substantial personal debts and legal fees, took off for Paris to sign a record deal for an LP of standards, including [...] "Non, je ne regrette rien". A month later, back in London, he disassociated himself from the film to which he had devoted so much time and money. McLaren went on to manage Adam and the Ants and Bow Wow Wow. In the mid-1980s he released a number of successful and influential records as a solo artist, including the UK's first ever hip-hop chart single, [...] "Buffalo Gals".|$|E
500|$|After days {{of media}} speculation, it was {{confirmed}} on September 6, 2007 that Spears {{would open the}} 2007 MTV Video Music Awards at the Pearl Theatre in the Palms Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas on September 9, 2007. It was also announced {{that she was going}} to perform [...] "Gimme More", with a magic act from illusionist Criss Angel in some parts of the performance. However, the bit is thought to have been rejected by the show's organisers at the last minute. The performance began with Spears lip synching the first lines of Elvis Presley's 1958 song [...] "Trouble". [...] "Gimme More" [...] began, and the camera panned out to reveal Spears wearing a black, jewel-encrusted bikini and black boots. She was accompanied by male and female dancers dressed in black outfits. Several pole dancers danced in smaller stages around the audience. The performance was universally panned by critics. Jeff Leeds of The New York Times said that [...] "no one was prepared for Sunday night's fiasco, in which a listless Ms. Spears teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words in a wan attempt to lip-synch her new single". Vinay Menon of the Toronto Star commented Spears [...] "looked hopelessly dazed. She was wearing the expression of somebody who had been deposited at the Palms Casino Resort by a tornado, one that promptly twisted away, taking her clothing and sense of purpose. [...] lumbering, in slow motion, as if somebody <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> cement into her streetwalker boots". David Willis of BBC stated her performance would [...] "go down in the history books as being one of the worst to grace the MTV Awards".|$|E

Within the first 24 hours of its posting, the video accumulated over 2 million views. [...] "Leave Britney alone!" [...] turned Crocker into an internet celebrity, and was featured on television shows such as The View and The Tonight Show with Jay Leno. It was also parodied by dozens of other YouTube users, most famously by actor Seth Green.

2500|$|Formed in 1890, the American Tobacco Company, {{headed by}} North Carolina {{entrepreneur}} George Washington Duke, underwent {{a period of}} rapid expansion throughout the early 20th century.

The pianos were placed at one end, with French provincial sofas cushioned by an oriental carpet at the other end. Gold and white silk wall panels concealed shelves for records, music-related books, and Hill's musical instruments. Hill had 108 speakers installed in the room, connected with four miles of wiring. He spent more than $20,000 on the room's sound system. Hill also added a hidden movie screen on which to project his collection of comedy films, which was also hidden {{behind one of the}} silk wall panels. [...] The room became a bone of contention; Joan was angry about the amount of money her husband <b>had</b> <b>poured</b> into realizing his dream.

2500|$|Conversely, Corrine Patton {{argued that}} [...] "this text {{does not support}} {{domestic}} abuse; and scholars, teachers, and preachers must continue to remind uninformed readers that such an interpretation is actually a misreading" [...] and that [...] "the theological aim of the passage is to save Yahweh from the scandal of being a cuckolded husband, i.e. a defeated, powerless, and ineffective god. [...] It is a view of God for whom no experience, not even rape and mutilation in wartime, is beyond hope for healing and redemption." [...] Regarding Ezekiel 16, Daniel I. Block wrote that [...] "the backdrop of divine judgment can be appreciated only {{against the backdrop of}} his grace.
