5|$|In many of {{the legends}} of the Cascade Mountains, there are thunderbirds that live on them and Adams is no exception. This {{particular}} thunderbird was named Enumtla and he terrorized {{the inhabitants of the}} land. Speelyi, the Klickitat coyote god, came along one day and they implored <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something.</b> Speelyi transformed himself into a feather and waited. It did not take long for Enumtla to see the feather and investigate. Being suspicious, he thundered at the feather with no effect. He paused and suddenly the magic feather let loose a terrific volley of thunder and lightning and stunned Enumtla. Speelyi then managed to overpower Enumtla and decreed that the thunderbird could no longer terrify the people, could only thunder on hot days, and could not destroy with lightning.|$|E
5|$|During the Crimean campaign, Manstein was {{indirectly}} {{involved in}} atrocities against the Soviet population, especially those committed by Einsatzgruppe D, {{one of several}} Schutzstaffel (SS) groups that had been tasked with {{the elimination of the}} Jews of Europe. Einsatzgruppe D travelled in the wake of Manstein's 11th Army, and were provided by Manstein's command with vehicles, fuel, and drivers. Military police cordoned off areas where the Einsatzgruppe planned to shoot Jews to prevent anyone from escaping. Captain Ulrich Gunzert, shocked to have witnessed Einsatzgruppe D massacre a group of Jewish women and children, went to Manstein to ask <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to stop the killings. Gunzert states that Manstein told him to forget what he had seen and to concentrate on fighting the Red Army. Eleven of the seventeen charges against Manstein at his later war crimes trial were related to Nazi maltreatment and killing of Jews and prisoners of war in the Crimea.|$|E
25|$|In 1976, {{three of}} Presley's bodyguards were fired {{and decided to}} write a tell-all book about their life in his inner circle. Worried about the impact such details might have on his career, Presley, through his father, asked Parker to stop the {{publication}} of the book. Parker made attempts to have it stopped, but failed to do so. According to Presley's friend, Larry Geller, Parker secretly wanted the book to be published, hoping that it would open Presley's eyes to how bad he had gotten and persuade <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> about it. The book would eventually be published in August 1977, two weeks before Presley's death.|$|E
60|$|Nothing {{could be}} more disarming than such genuine sorrow; and Sophy, pardoning him with all her heart, and {{mourning}} for her past want of charity, watched <b>him,</b> longing <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> for his comfort, and to evince her tenderness; but only succeeded in encumbering every petty service or word of intercourse with a weight of sad consciousness.|$|R
50|$|A mysterious {{man named}} Bert Smith, aware that Lloyd is {{down on his}} luck, offers <b>him</b> $25,000 <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> illegal and dangerous—transport {{currency}} from Cairo to Madrid, dropping the box of cash in mid-air. Lloyd has wagered his last $1,000 on a horse race. He says if the horse wins, he won't need Smith's offer, but the race ends tragically with the jockey killed. Lloyd suspects foul play.|$|R

But there must be something in you that understands things--all kinds of things--or you couldn't put it all into music the way you do. How do you do it?

500|$|Musically, {{the song}} is set in common time and has a tempo of 120 beats per minute. While it is played in the key of C major and has backing piano and guitar sounds, [...] "Alfie" [...] also uses a sample from Sandie Shaw's 1967 Eurovision Song Contest winning song [...] "Puppet on a String". In an {{interview}} with Pitchfork Media, Allen stated that the song's lyrics describe her younger brother, Alfie Allen. She further explained:When I wrote [...] "Alfie", nobody really knew who I was. At first he was really upset about it, because he thought that I was just pointing out all of his bad points and attacking him. I thought it was really flattering [...] I thought he'd be really, really happy because it proved to him how much I loved him, that I care about him, and I want <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> with his life. I suppose his paranoia — induced by smoking so much weed — made him think, [...] "Why {{are you trying to}} be mean?" ...|$|E

50|$|Healing the Wounds {{was founded}} by Kevin Richards in 2009. Richards had {{previously}} served with the Royal Regiment of Wales as a combat medic and completed tours of duty in numerous countries including Northern Ireland and Operation Desert Storm.

50|$|In the epilogues, {{the head}} writer comes to grip with the {{consequences}} of his bad writing choices, while the producer’s son, having reverted to his personality from the crewman who switched with <b>him,</b> determines <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> useful with himself. The final vignette shows an actress, who once played an extra on the show, receiving a message showing intimate details of the woman whose life—and death—she helped create. She memorializes her lost “sister” on a beach and meets the head writer of the show, with both realizing that their characters on the show were married.|$|R
50|$|In addition, {{he can use}} {{the money}} to buy {{clothing}} (which he likes very much) for both himself and his wife. In particular, he enjoys dressing his fashion-unconscious wife, much to her distaste. Roarke also gives Eve as many gifts as he can possibly get away with, justifying it because he wants to make up for everything she was not given before. Some times he gets pissed off with Eve when she hides things from him or when she orders <b>him</b> not <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> or when she refuses to use his money.|$|R
2500|$|Dershowitz {{attended}} Yeshiva University High School, {{an independent}} boys' prep school owned by Yeshiva University, in Manhattan, New York City, {{where he played}} on the basketball team. He was a rebellious student, often criticized by his teachers. The school's career placement center {{told him he had}} talent and was capable of becoming an advertising executive, funeral director, or salesman. He later said his teachers told <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> that [...] "requires a big mouth and no brain ... so I became a lawyer." [...] After graduating from high school, he attended Brooklyn College and received his A.B. in 1959, majoring in Political Science. [...] Next he attended Yale Law School, where he was editor-in-chief of the Yale Law Journal, and graduated first in his class with a Bachelor of Laws (LL.B.) in 1962. He {{was a member of a}} Conservative minyan at Harvard Hillel, but is now a secular Jew.|$|E
2500|$|Some {{people believe}} it was Twitchell's second wife who {{suggested}} that he adapt some of his spiritual education into a new religion. Twitchell said her encouragement was a spark for <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> more with his writings. Critics state that at first Twitchell claimed his teachings were new but that he eventually referred to them as an ancient science that pre-dated all other major religious belief systems. Others say this interpretation is based on comments Twitchell made before he officially started Eckankar, when he was promoting what he called his Cliff-Hanger philosophy, which was an outsider's view on modern society. Those were indeed his own views and ideas. However, once he launched Eckankar in October 1965, he always {{referred to it as}} being an ancient teaching. In his book Eckankar: The Key to Secret Worlds, Twitchell lays out wide-ranging examples of the teaching down through history, while also explaining his own personal experiences with his teacher, ECK master Rebazar Tarzs. The actual existence of [...] "Rebazar Tarzs," [...] like that of other Theosophical and ECK masters, remains disputed, since he is not an historical figure, is not physically accessible, and has made no public appearance.|$|E
2500|$|Chief Gadibia (Isaac Yongo), one of {{the chiefs}} who have been {{receiving}} bribes from Western Oil, and also embezzling funds meant for community development, tells his fellow elders that {{he is no longer}} interested in the [...] "unclean" [...] money and he wants to return his share to the people. Gadibia dies the following day, the Elders having poisoned his drink the previous night. Peter (OC Ukeje), Gadibia's son, to whom he has already confessed, explains the incident to Ebiere and how sure he is that his father was murdered by the Elders. Gadibia's stolen fund is discovered in his house and the other elders involved are captured by the community people, led by Ebiere. Ebiere wants the Elders to be reported to the police, but the people refuse to listen and set them ablaze instead. Everyone at the vicinity of the crime is arrested by the Police; Ebiere however claims responsibility for the crime and is sentenced to death by hanging. The film shifts back to the present in the Los Angeles tunnel; Tom Hudson calls Nigeria's Head of State and tells <b>him</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> to stop the execution of Ebiere, but his request isn't granted. Angela (Vivica Fox) of the US Anti-terrorism unit advises that the United States make a diplomatic call to the Nigerian Government, but the head of the department says they do not negotiate with terrorists. They eventually resolve to issue a deceptive press release, stating that Ebiere has been released. When the emancipation movement is informed about the release, they drop their weapons as a result and also release the rest of the hostages, including Tom Hudson. They are arrested by the United States Police, while Ebiere still gets hanged in Nigeria.|$|E

When Marv informs Bob that he will be calling in sick {{on the day of the}} Super Bowl, Bob becomes suspicious and warns <b>him</b> <b>to</b> not <b>do</b> <b>something</b> desperate [...] "that we can't clean up this time". On Super Bowl night, with Rocco in tow, Bob takes $10,000 hidden in his basement and hides it behind the bar counter, with a pistol.|$|R

When he reveals to her that he was once incarcerated in a juvenile correctional facility for stealing cars, Greta is even more attracted <b>to</b> <b>him.</b> Julie tells her that his experience made <b>him</b> determined <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>something</b> positive with his life and he attempts to convince Greta to not give up on hers.

60|$|Her {{absolute}} fearlessness of {{the things}} which children shrank from, the dark, and things of the dark, made her a marked figure.

[...] Matt Bjorke of Roughstock gave the song four stars out of five, saying that [...] "with low booming bass lines and a percussive arena-rock melody backing up Dierks Bentley's lyrics, 'I Hold On' is the kind of song that showcases Dierks Bentley in a new way."
