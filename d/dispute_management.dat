40|$|Alternative dispute {{resolution}} (a. d. r.) processes are entrenched in western style legal systems. Forms of {{dispute resolution}} are utilised within schools and health systems; built in to commercial contracts; found in workplaces, clubs and organisations; and accepted in general day-to-day community disputes. The a. d. r. literature includes references to ‘apology’, but is largely silent on ‘forgiveness’. Where an apology is offered {{as part of}} a dispute resolution process, practice suggests that formalised ‘forgiveness’ rarely follows. Mediators may agree there is a meaningful place for apology in dispute resolution processes, but are most unlikely to support a view that forgiveness, as a conscious act, has an equivalent place. Yet, if forgiveness {{is not limited to the}} ‘pardoning of an offence’, but includes a ‘giving up of resentment’, or the relinquishing of a grudge, then forgiveness may play an underestimated role in <b>dispute</b> <b>management.</b> In the context of some day-to-day <b>dispute</b> <b>management</b> practice, this paper questions whether forgiveness should follow an apology; and concludes that meaningful resolutions can be reached without any formal element of ‘forgiveness’ or absolution. However, <b>dispute</b> <b>management</b> practitioners need to be aware of the latent role other aspects of forgiveness may play for the disputing parties. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{expansion of}} the Islamic financial services industry beyond its original frontiers has not only come with success stories but has also {{been affected by the}} growing preference for litigation as the mode of dispute resolution. Exorbitant legal fees and cost of sustaining protracted litigation are two major challenges that require the attention of major stakeholders in the industry. This paper examines these challenges through a Maqāṣid al-Sharī‘ah focused prism considering the importance of the sustainable <b>dispute</b> <b>management</b> framework in Islamic financial services and products. While singling out the important higher objective (maqṣad) of ḥifẓ al-māl, this study argues that preservation of wealth and financial resources requires effective means of resolving increasingly diverse disputes in the Islamic financial services industry. It is further argued that an effective <b>dispute</b> <b>management</b> framework will consider the original value proposition of Islamic financial intermediation which promotes maṣlaḥah (benefits) and prevents mafsadah (hardship) and ḍarar (financial harm). This makes a case for the affirmative relevance, potential adoption, and systemic modernisation of Islamic <b>dispute</b> <b>management</b> mechanisms such as ṣulḥ, taḥkīm, and muḥtasib in order to fulfil the overarching objective of protection and preservation of wealth and financial resources as one of the core objectives of Sharī‘ah. <br /...|$|E
