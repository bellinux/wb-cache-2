50|$|Rogers {{proposes that}} there are five main {{attributes}} of innovative technologies which influence acceptance, which he calls the ACCTO criteria. These are relative Advantage, Compatibility, Complexity, Trialability, and Observability. Relative advantage may be economic or non-economic, and is the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> innovation is seen as superior to prior innovations fulfilling the same needs. It is positively related to acceptance (i.e., the higher the relative advantage, the higher the adoption level, and vice versa). Compatibility is the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> innovation appears consistent with existing values, past experiences, habits and needs to the potential adopter; {{a low level of}} compatibility will slow acceptance. Complexity is the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> innovation appears difficult to understand and use; the more complex an innovation, the slower its acceptance. Trialability is the perceived <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> innovation may be tried on a limited basis, and is positively related to acceptance. Trialability can accelerate acceptance because small-scale testing reduces risk. Observability is the perceived <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> results of innovating are visible to others and is positively related to acceptance.|$|R

For example, organisms living in communities that are in isolation from one another may be organized differently from {{the same type of}} organism living in a large continuous population, thus the community-level structure is influenced by population-level interactions.|$|E
25|$|The <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> tendon is {{reparable}} {{depends on}} its quantity and quality. Degenerated tendons are often frail and retracted {{and may not be}} amenable to repair. Individuals that are elderly, smokers, or those having had cortisone injections often have weaker tendon tissue that fails without a significant injury. By contrast those whose tendon was torn by a substantial fall often have good quality tendon that can be repaired if surgery is performed promptly after the injury.|$|E
25|$|In {{recent years}} the Conservative Party has shown to have members with a mixed opinion of the EU, with pro-European Conservatives joining the {{affiliate}} Conservative Group for Europe, whilst some Eurosceptics have left the party to join the United Kingdom Independence Party. Under current EU practices, the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> Conservative Government could implement policy change regarding the EU would depend directly on the willingness of other EU member states to agree to such policies.|$|E

25|$|In medicine, {{compliance}} (also adherence, capacitance) {{describes the}} <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> patient correctly follows medical advice. Most commonly, {{it refers to}} medication or drug compliance, {{but it can also}} apply to other situations such as medical device use, self care, self-directed exercises, or therapy sessions. Both the patient and the health-care provider affect compliance, and a positive physician-patient relationship is {{the most important factor in}} improving compliance, although the high cost of prescription medication also plays a major role.|$|E
25|$|Though the {{relatively}} small size of the crease is such that they limit the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> batsman or a bowler can alter where they stand to face or deliver a ball, there is a degree of latitude afforded whereby both can move around the crease {{as long as they}} remain within the aforementioned confines. Batsmen 'use the crease' when they move toward leg or off, before or while playing a shot. Bowlers 'use the crease' by varying the position of their feet, relative to the stumps, at the moment of delivery. In so doing, they can alter the angle of delivery and the trajectory of the ball.|$|E
25|$|Hans Eysenck {{described}} extraversion-introversion as the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> {{person is}} outgoing and interactive with other people. These behavioral differences are {{presumed to be}} the result of underlying differences in brain physiology. Eysenck combined cortical inhibition and excitation with the ascending reticular activation system (ARAS), a pathway located in the brainstem. Extraverts seek excitement and social activity in an effort to heighten their arousal level, whereas introverts tend to avoid social situations in an effort to keep such arousal to a minimum. Eysenck designated extraversion as one of three major traits in his P-E-N model of personality, which also includes psychoticism and neuroticism.|$|E

25|$|The way the {{individual}} {{rights of a}} family member versus {{the rights of the}} family as a unit are balanced vary significantly in different societies. This may influence the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> government may be willing to investigate family incidents. In some cultures, individual members of the family are expected to sacrifice almost completely their own interests in favor of the interests of the family as a whole. What is viewed as an undue expression of personal autonomy is condemned as unacceptable. In these cultures the family predominates over {{the individual}}, and where this interacts with cultures of honor, individualistic choice that may damage the family reputation in the community may result in extreme punishment, such as honor killings.|$|E
25|$|The {{brilliance}} {{of lead crystal}} relies on the high refractive index caused by the lead content. Ordinary glass has a refractive index of n = 1.5, while the addition of lead produces a range up to 1.7 or 1.8. This heightened refractive index also correlates with increased dispersion, which measures the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> medium separates light into its component spectra, as in a prism. Crystal cutting techniques exploit these properties to create a brilliant, sparkling effect as each cut facet reflects and transmits light through the object. The high refractive index is useful for lens making, since a given focal length can be achieved with a thinner lens. However, the dispersion must be corrected by other components of the lens system {{if it is to}} be achromatic.|$|E
25|$|The use of Irish was {{influenced}} by immigrants' local origins, {{the time of their}} arrival and the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> sense of Irishness survived. In 1894 the New Zealand Tablet, a Catholic newspaper, published articles on the study of Irish. In 1895 it was resolved at a meeting in the city of Dunedin that an Irish-language society on the lines of the Philo-Celtic Society of New York should be established in New Zealand. Gaelic League branches were formed in two New Zealand localities (Milton and Balclutha) and items in Irish were published by the Southern Cross of Invercargill. In 1903 Fr William Ganly, a native speaker from the Aran Islands prominent in Gaelic Revival circles in Melbourne, visited Milton, where he met a large number of Irish speakers.|$|E

25|$|In 1984, the ABFO {{began making}} {{an attempt to}} {{diminish}} the discrepancies and increase the validity of bite mark analysis by creating bite mark methodology guidelines. The guidelines attempt to establish standard terminology in describing bite marks and that {{reduces the risk of}} biased results. The ABFO also provides advice on how to effectively collect and preserve evidence. For example, they recommend that the collection of DNA evidence and detailed photographs of bites be taken together at the crime scene. The guidelines also outline how and what a forensic odontologist should record, such as the location, contours, shape, and size of a bite mark. They also provide a system of scoring to assess the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> suspectâ€™s dental profile and bite mark match. According to the ABFO, the guidelines are not a mandate of methods to be used, but a list of generally accepted methods. The guidelines are intended to prevent potentially useful evidence from being thrown out simply because the forensic odontologistâ€™s collection methods were not standardized.|$|E
25|$|In appearance, {{the larvae}} are dark orange with small black spines {{protruding}} {{outward from the}} body. The larval stages of gulf fritillaries include five instars, each with a varying timeframe. After the eggs hatch, the new larvae eats the egg casings for food. Eventually, the larvae will transition either to consuming other eggs or parts of the host plant for nourishment. Throughout the first three instar stages, the larvae primarily consume the leaves and feed away from the leaf margins of the host plant. How much of the leaf and how deep into the layers the larva will eat depend on the type (i.e. thickness or thinness) of the leaf in question. Throughout the last two instar stages, the larvae mainly consume the leaves and feed at the leaf margins. Throughout this food acquisition process, the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> specific leaf is eaten before it is abandoned in favor of another newer leaf largely depends on whether food is in plentiful or scarce supply. The average duration of the larval stage is between 11 and 16 days depending on {{the temperature of the}} environment.|$|E

The second factor concerns the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>an</b> individual is rewarded for performing skills.

The third factor is the <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the individual's cultural context values and promotes understanding of skills over efficiency. These factors, the authors believe, serve to promote not just procedural understanding but conceptual understanding of skills.|$|R
