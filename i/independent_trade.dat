5|$|Wałęsa {{worked closely}} with the Workers' Defence Committee (KOR), a group that emerged to lend aid to people arrested after the 1976 labor strikes and to their families. In June 1978 he became an activist of the {{underground}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). On 14 August 1980, another rise in food prices led to a strike at the Lenin Shipyard in Gdańsk, of which Wałęsa was one of the instigators. Wałęsa scaled the shipyard fence and quickly became one of the strike leaders. The strike inspired other similar strikes in Gdańsk, which then spread across Poland. Wałęsa headed the Inter-Plant Strike Committee, coordinating the workers at Gdańsk and at 20 other plants in the region. On 31 August the government, represented by Mieczysław Jagielski, signed an accord (the Gdańsk Agreement) with the Strike Coordinating Committee. The agreement granted the Lenin Shipyard workers the right to strike and permitted them to form an <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> union. The Strike Coordinating Committee legalized itself as the National Coordinating Committee of the Solidarność (Solidarity) Free Trade Union, and Wałęsa was chosen as chairman of the Committee. The Solidarity trade union quickly grew, ultimately claiming over 10 million members—more than a quarter of Poland's population. Wałęsa's role in the strike, in the negotiations, and in the newly formed <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> union gained him fame on the international stage.|$|E
5|$|On August 14, the {{shipyard}} workers began their strike, {{organized by the}} Free Trade Unions of the Coast (Wolne Związki Zawodowe Wybrzeża). The workers were led by electrician Lech Wałęsa, a former shipyard worker who had been dismissed in 1976, and who arrived at {{the shipyard}} late {{in the morning of}} August 14. The strike committee demanded the rehiring of Walentynowicz and Wałęsa, as well as the according of respect to workers' rights and other social concerns. In addition, they called for the raising of a monument to the shipyard workers who had been killed in 1970 and for the legalization of <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions.|$|E
5|$|On August 16, {{delegations}} {{from other}} strike committees {{arrived at the}} shipyard. Delegates (Bogdan Lis, Andrzej Gwiazda and others) together with shipyard strikers agreed to create an Inter-Enterprise Strike Committee (Międzyzakładowy Komitet Strajkowy, or MKS). On August 17 a priest, Henryk Jankowski, performed a mass outside the shipyard's gate, at which 21 demands of the MKS were put forward. The list went beyond purely local matters, beginning with a demand for new, <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions and going on {{to call for a}} relaxation of the censorship, a right to strike, new rights for the Church, the freeing of political prisoners, and improvements in the national health service.|$|E

50|$|The company {{purchases}} seal {{skin from}} all over Greenland. The company owns trading stations, skin centers, in Maniitsoq, Nuuk, Tasiilaq, and Upernavik, as well as <b>independent</b> <b>trading</b> stations in smaller villages, totalling more than 70 <b>independent</b> <b>trading</b> stations. Dried seal skin can also be purchased from the smallest communities via Pilersuisoq. In total over 2,500 people {{are involved in the}} seal skin trade. This makes Great Greenland Furhouse one of the biggest employers in the entire country. Also, of the 64 people directly employed the company, 51 are working in Qaqortoq, making Great Greenland one of the biggest employers in the town.|$|R
5|$|In 1920 and 1921, local {{opposition}} to requisitioning resulted in anti-Bolshevik peasant uprisings breaking out across Russia, which were suppressed. Among {{the most significant}} was the Tambov Rebellion, which was put down by the Red Army. In February 1921, workers went on strike in Petrograd, resulting in the government proclaiming martial law {{in the city and}} sending in the Red Army to quell demonstrations. In March, the Kronstadt rebellion began when sailors in Kronstadt revolted against the Bolshevik government, demanding that all socialists be allowed to publish freely, that <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions be given freedom of assembly and that peasants be allowed free markets and not be subject to requisitioning. Lenin declared that the mutineers had been misled by the Socialist Revolutionaries and foreign imperialists, calling for violent reprisals. Under Trotsky's leadership, the Red Army put down the rebellion on 17 March, resulting in thousands of deaths and the internment of survivors in labour camps.|$|E
5|$|Because of the 1976 {{disturbances}} and {{the subsequent}} arrests, mistreatment and dismissals of worker militants, a group of intellectuals led by Jacek Kuroń, Antoni Macierewicz, Jan Józef Lipski and Adam Michnik founded and operated the Workers' Defence Committee (Komitet Obrony Robotników; KOR). The aim of the KOR was to assist the worker victims of the 1976 repression. Working to support the spontaneous workers' movements, the dissidents recognized the necessarily predominant role {{of the working class}} in resisting the abuses of the regime and the newly formed opposition increasingly became characterized by an alliance of intelligentsia with workers. The KOR, according to Modzelewski, constituted the core of organized opposition and a seed of political alternative; clearing the way for other opposition formations, it engendered political pluralism. More opposition groups indeed soon followed, including the Movement for Defense of Human and Civic Rights (ROPCiO), Free Trade Unions of the Coast (WZW) and the Confederation of Independent Poland (KPN). The periodical Robotnik ("The Worker") was distributed in factories from September 1977. The idea of <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions was first raised by the Gdańsk and Szczecin workers striking in 1970–71, but was later developed and promoted by the KOR and its leftist collaborators, which led to the establishment in 1978 of Free Trade Unions, the precursor of Solidarity. The KPN represented the minority at that time right-wing of the Polish opposition scene. The opposition members tried to resist the regime by denouncing it for violating the Polish constitution, Polish laws and Poland's international obligations. They fit within the post-Helsinki Soviet Bloc human rights movements {{and for the most part}} had not yet developed more radical, anti-system orientations.|$|E
25|$|Specific countries, {{especially}} countries run by Communist parties, {{while still}} having unions in name, {{do not allow}} for <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions, just as they rarely allow for independent businesses. These state-run trade unions do not function {{in the same way}} as <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions and generally do not hold any kind of collective bargaining power, acting to ensure the smooth running of Government industry.|$|E

25|$|That same year, all {{trade unions}} were {{consolidated}} {{into a single}} union, the National Union of Zairian Workers, and brought under government control.

25|$|Labour {{turmoil in}} Poland during 1980 {{had led to}} the {{formation}} of the <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> union, Solidarity, led by Lech Wałęsa, which over time became a political force.

25|$|Following lengthy {{negotiations}} between the FORA IX {{and a number of}} hitherto <b>independent</b> <b>trade</b> unions, the Argentine Syndicates' Union (USA) was founded in March 1922.

Having the support of socialists, communists, and syndicalists, the USA was more radical than the FORA IX and therefore joined neither the social democratic International Federation of Trade Unions nor the RILU.|$|E
