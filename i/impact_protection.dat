5|$|The FIA {{announced}} a ten-person review panel, composed of former drivers and team principals, {{to investigate the}} cause of the accident and published its findings four weeks later in Doha. According to the report, there was no single cause of Bianchi's accident; contributing factors included track conditions, car speed and the presence of a recovery vehicle on the track. The report made several suggestions to improve safety when recovering disabled vehicles (which were introduced for 2015), and concluded {{that it would have been}} impossible to mitigate Bianchi's injuries with changes to cockpit design. Since 2015, for safety reasons, the FIA has required that the start time of certain Grands Prix be at least four hours before sunset or dusk (except for designated night races). FIA safety commission chairman Peter Wright was quoted in July 2015 as saying that a closed cockpit would not have prevented Bianchi's head injuries, and vice-president Andy Mellow confirmed that attaching <b>impact</b> <b>protection</b> to recovery vehicles was unfeasible.|$|E
5|$|Engine {{packaging}} {{became a}} contentious issue during development. Holden's designers wanted the engine positioned well {{behind the front}} axle to allow short overhangs and an overall sportier appearance, whereas the crash engineers were concerned that this would reduce the body's impact absorption in an accident. Negotiation between designers and crash engineers resulted in moving some of the engine components, including relocating the battery to the boot, freeing up valuable front-end space. By having the engine moved back and further down, the VE Commodore also benefits from near perfect 50:50 weight distribution across all variants, leading to superior handling. Crash engineers introduced several other safety initiatives, including relocating the fuel tank {{in front of the}} rear-axle line, instead of behind. A more crash-resistant rear-end was also seen as necessary. The design though had to incorporate a spacious boot and a spare-wheel bay that could house the largest-sized wheel to be fitted to the car. Crash test results from Australasian New Car Assessment Program (ANCAP) rate the VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the previous generation Commodore. The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing VZ, due to improvements in side <b>impact</b> <b>protection</b> giving a score of 27.45 out of 37 or a four star rating out of a possible five.|$|E

25|$|One {{innovation}} was {{the attention}} paid to passive safety.

25|$|In 1994, {{to add to}} its SIPS, Volvo was {{the first}} to {{introduce}} side airbags and installed them as standard equipment in all models from 1995.

25|$|By November, 1990, the 52/55hp (carbureted/EPI) non-turbo F6A SOHC 4-valve engine became {{available}}, {{available in}} {{a whole range of}} versions: M as three- or five-door (later only five), with manual or automatic transmissions and FWD or 4WD, a sportier S only as a three-door, and the luxurious L only as a five-door with the more powerful EPI engine - which also appeared in 4WDs equipped with automatics. In September 1991 the range was revised, receiving side <b>impact</b> <b>protection</b> and a high mounted brakelight. Since these were considered structural changes the car received a new set of model codes, becoming the CN22S/CP22S/CN32S/CP32S. The SR-Four now came with all-around disc brakes while the S-Turbo was discontinued. An FWD automatic MC version joined the range at the lower end, equipped with a column-mounted shifter. Other special versions abounded, with the luxurious F-Limited EPI 3-door joining in December 1991 and the somewhat cheaper, carbureted M Selection in April 1992. In July of that year, the 3-door, automatic only S Selection managed to find a slot in a pricelist now comprising a faintly ridiculous 27 variants. This didn't hinder Suzuki from adding more versions, the well-equipped LoFt (sic), in June 1994 and the A in April of that year.|$|E

40|$|Electrical and {{electronic}} {{systems can be}} disturbed by radiation-induced effects. In some cases, radiation-induced effects are of a low probability and can be ignored; however, radiation effects must be considered when designing systems that have a high {{mean time to failure}} requirement, an <b>impact</b> on <b>protection,</b> and/or higher exposure to radiation. High-energy physics power systems suffer from a combination of these effects: a high mean time to failure is required, failure can <b>impact</b> on <b>protection,</b> and the proximity of systems to accelerators increases the likelihood of radiation-induced events. This paper presents the principal radiation-induced effects, and radiation environments typical to high-energy physics. It outlines a procedure for designing and validating radiation-tolerant systems using commercial off-the-shelf components. The paper ends with a worked example of radiation-tolerant power converter controls that are being developed for the Large Hadron Collider and High Luminosity-Large Hadron Collider at CERN.

2500|$|A {{cycle helmet}} should {{generally}} be light in weight and provide ample ventilation because cycling {{can be an}} intense aerobic activity which significantly raises body temperature, and the head in particular {{needs to be able}} to regulate its temperature. The dominant form of the helmet up to the 1970s was the leather [...] "hairnet" [...] style. This offered acceptable protection from scrapes and cuts, but only minimal <b>impact</b> <b>protection,</b> and was mainly used by racing cyclists. More widespread use of helmets began in the U.S. in the 1970s. After many decades, when bicycles were regarded only as children's toys, many American adults took up cycling during and after the bike boom of the 1970s. Two of the first modern bicycle helmets were made by MSR, a manufacturer of mountaineering equipment, and Bell Sports, a manufacturer of helmets for auto racing and motorcycles. These helmets were a spin-off from the development of expanded polystyrene foam liners for motorcycling and motorsport helmets and had hard polycarbonate plastic shells. The bicycle helmet arm of Bell was split off in 1991 as Bell Sports Inc., having completely overtaken the motorcycle and motorsports helmet business.|$|E

40|$|Predicting the {{consequences}} of highly energetic particle beams <b>impacting</b> <b>protection</b> devices as collimators or high power target stations is a fundamental issue {{in the design of}} state-of-the-art facilities for high-energy particle physics. These complex dynamic phenomena can be successfully simulated resorting to highly non-linear numerical tools (Hydrocodes). In order to produce accurate results, however, these codes require reliable material constitutive models that, at the extreme conditions induced by a destructive beam impact, are scarce and often inaccurate. In order to derive or validate such models a comprehensive, first-of-its-kind experiment has been recently carried out at CERN HiRadMat facility: performed tests entailed the controlled impact of intense and energetic proton pulses on a number of specimens made of six different materials. Experimental data were acquired relying on embedded instrumentation (strain gauges, temperature probes and vacuum sensors) and on remote-acquisition devices (laser Doppler vibrometer and high-speed camera). The method presented in this paper, combining experimental measurements with numerical simulations, may find applications to assess materials under very high strain rates and temperatures in domains well beyond particle physics (severe accidents in fusion and fission nuclear facilities, space debris impacts, fast and intense loadings on materials and structures etc.) ...|$|R
