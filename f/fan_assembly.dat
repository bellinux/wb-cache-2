40|$|The {{subject is}} {{introduced}} by describing the aerodynamic and vibration characteristics of unstalled, supersonic flutter in <b>fan</b> <b>assemblies</b> having part-span shrouds or clappers. It is briefly compared and contrasted with stall flutter. The importance of frequency and modeshape analyses is stressed and supersonic flutter prediction methods are examined, commencing with the modeshape parameter CO/H. Unsteady work theory {{leads to the}} study of aerodynamic damping with the prediction of flutter mode, speed and wave direction. Throughout, emphasis is given to the support of design analysis by test data, from laboratory measurements on stationary models to full scale engine Altitude Test Chamber behaviour. Finally, the effect on flutter of some of the operating criteria in engine service is considered. * Replaces A. R. C. 36 374 LIST OF CONTENT...|$|R

5000|$|The National Transportation Safety Board {{determined}} the probable {{cause of this}} accident was {{the disintegration of the}} No. 3 engine <b>fan</b> <b>assembly</b> {{as a result of an}} interaction between the fan blade tips and the fan case. According to the NTSB, [...] "the precise reason or reasons for the acceleration and the onset of the destructive vibration could not be determined conclusively," [...] but enough was learned to prevent the occurrence of similar events. The speed of the engine at the time of the accident caused a resonance wave to occur in the <b>fan</b> <b>assembly</b> when the tips of the fan blades began to make contact with the surrounding shroud. The engine was designed to have a rearward blade retaining force of 18,000 pounds to prevent the blades from moving forward in their mountings slots and subsequently departing the fan disk. The rearward force was not enough. As a result of this accident, GE re-designed the engine so that the blade retaining capability was increased to 60,000 pounds, and that change was incorporated into all engines already in service.|$|E

40|$|Objectives.   The aim of {{the study}} is to develop a {{construction}} design that increases the intensity of heat exchange between media and optimises the energy and mass dimensions of the instrument indicators. Methods. A method for the theoretical investigation of thermoelectric heat transfer intensifiers is used, which, by means of forced air flows along the junctions of thermoelements, provides a higher coefficient of heat exchange between media moving in transport zones with altering temperature. Results. The construction of a thermoelectric heat transfer intensifier is proposed, which uses <b>fan</b> <b>assemblies</b> to force air flow in the respective gaps between the junctions of the thermoelements and the media moving in transport zones to increase the heat transfer coefficient. A device model based on the solution of the heat balance equations for media flows in transport zones, thermoelectric battery surfaces and gaps between transport zones and battery surfaces for direct flow conditions is considered. Theoretical studies of the heat transfer intensifier using the developed model were carried out. The dependencies of the media temperature alterations at the output of the heat transfer intensifier on the value of the heat transfer coefficient between the junctions of the thermoelectric battery and the air medium in the gap are determined for a fixed value of the thermoelectric battery supply current equal to 5 A. Conclusion. It is established that an increase in media temperature difference at the input contributes to a sharper decrease in the dependencies of the limiting lengths of the thermoelectric battery on the heat transfer coefficient between the junctions of the thermoelectric battery and the air medium in the gap at a constant supply current.  </p...|$|R
40|$|For {{the past}} two decades, {{virtually}} all manufacturing companies in the United States have adopted or {{are in the process}} of adopting lean manufacturing. Globalization has resulted in the increased availability of reliable, low cost sources putting greater pressures on traditional US manufacturing companies to reduce costs. The need to successfully transform to lean has only grown in importance in this new operating environment, resulting in renewed focus on such initiatives in the United States. This thesis discusses various approaches to lean manufacturing with reference to specific examples from both academia and industry. In particular, lean transformation efforts in Mitchell Engine Company's* Final Assembly Plant will be provided as a case study. Focus on the JP- 3525 <b>fan</b> case <b>assembly</b> cell provides specific examples on how shop floor improvements, assembly cell redesign, and flow can improve process cycle time and decrease variability. The direct result of this work has been a 15 % decrease in cycle time and a 100 % decrease in variability in the JP- 3525 <b>fan</b> case <b>assembly</b> cell. Finally, the role front-line supervisors play in change initiatives will be introduced, discussing the position from both management and labor perspectives. Based on past research, recommendations will be made on how to improve cell leader effectiveness, recognizing these changes require systemic change within the organization. by Douglas H.

40|$|PM motor reduces {{energy demand}} of a {{shipboard}} <b>Fan</b> Coil <b>Assemblies</b> (FCA) by> 50 %. Since {{there are over}} 5, 000 FCAs in the U.

The benefits of VFD-based FCAs have not been realized with commercially available Voltage Source Converter (VSC) based VSDs because added filter components, power conditioning and environmental mitigation required for shipboard compatibility increase the size to six times the conventional motor controller based solution. This paper presents a 3. 75 horsepower VSD/PM motor based FCA system having sufficient compactness to fit within the space allocated for the motor and fan in a typical FCA system of this size. A significant power density is achieved in the VSD by using Current Source Converter (CSC) based interface as the front end interface to the 440 V distribution system. The CSC-based rectifier requires no inrush limiting circuitry, smaller EMI and differential mode filtering when compared to its VSC counterpart.
