The first type is a two-dimensional (2 D) rib design which is very common in proton exchange membrane fuel cell (PEMFC) products so far; the second type is a three-dimensional (3 <b>D)</b> <b>pillar</b> design. The analysis will find optimal sizes of ribs and pillars in a given area of membrane to meet the objective of maximum power density. The same optimization analysis will be carried further for different sizes of the given area of the membrane. Using these results, optimal sizes and ratios of the current collectors and their control areas will be recommended for fuel cell design.|$|E

Satisfactory expressions for the latter are thus required in complex geometries.

The significance of this investigation is that at sub-millimetre-wave or THz frequencies, where the waveguide features are less than 100 μm and the skin depths are less than 200 nm, the exact conductor shape and surface roughness have a significant electrical effect and any variations result in an important disagreement between the modelled and measured characteristics. This is a proof of concept validation of the rapid manufacturing approach and is aimed at paving {{the way to a}} range of THz passive waveguide components, where the availability and cost of such components is typically prohibitive and where the surface roughness is minimized and highly reproducible. Using this approach the fabrication times can be as rapid as a few days and can yield many hundreds of highly reproducible millimetre scale components...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{fabricated}} 3 <b>D</b> <b>pillar</b> type silicon-oxide-nitride-oxide-silicon (SONOS) {{devices for}} high density flashapplications. To solve the limitation between erase speed and data retention {{of the conventional}} SONOS devices,bandgap-engineered (BE) tunneling oxide of oxide-nitride-oxide configuration is integrated with the 3 D structure. In addition, the tunneling oxide is modulated by another method of N 2 ion implantation (N 2 I/I). The measureddata shows that the BE-SONOS device has better electrical characteristics, such as a lower threshold voltage (VT) of 0. 13 V, and a higher gm. max of 18. 6 μA/V and mobility of 27. 02 cm 2 /Vs than the conventional and N 2 I/I SONOSdevices. Memory characteristics show that the modulated tunneling oxide devices have fast erase speed. Among thedevices, the BE-SONOS device has faster program/erase (P/E) speed, and more stable endurance characteristics,than conventional and N 2 I/I devices. From the flicker noise analysis, however, the BE-SONOS device seems to havemore interface traps between the tunneling oxide and silicon substrate, which {{should be considered in}} designingthe process conditions. Finally, 3 D structures, such as the pillar type BE-SONOS device, are more suitable for nextgeneration memory devices than other modulated tunneling oxide devices...|$|E

In order to process the huge quantity of point cloud data effectively and reconstruct their 3 D models, more effective methods should be developed based on existing automatic or semiautomatic point cloud processing algorithms. Here introduce a new algorithm for rapid extracting the pillar features of Chinese ancient buildings from their point cloud data, the algorithm has the least human interaction in the data processing and is more efficient to extract pillars from point cloud data than existing feature extracting algorithms.

40|$|Cell {{migration}} {{processes are}} controlled by sensitive interaction with external cues such as topographic structures of the cell's environment. Here, we present systematically controlled assays to investigate the specific effects of spatial density and local geometry of topographic structure on amoeboid migration of Dictyostelium discoideum cells. This is realized by well-controlled fabrication of quasi- 3 <b>D</b> <b>pillar</b> fields exhibiting a systematic variation of inter-pillar distance and pillar lattice geometry. By time-resolved local mean-squared displacement analysis of amoeboid migration, we can extract motility parameters in order to elucidate the details of amoeboid migration mechanisms and consolidate them in a two-state contact-controlled motility model, distinguishing directed and random phases. Specifically, we find that directed pillar-to-pillar runs are found preferably in high pillar density regions, and cells in directed motion states sense pillars as attractive topographic stimuli. In contrast, cell motion in random probing states is inhibited by high pillar density, where pillars act as obstacles for cell motion. In a gradient spatial density, these mechanisms lead to topographic guidance of cells, with a general trend towards a regime of inter-pillar spacing close to the cell diameter. In locally anisotropic pillar environments, cell migration is often found to be damped due to competing attraction by different pillars in close proximity and {{due to lack of}} other potential stimuli {{in the vicinity of the}} cell. Further, we demonstrate topographic cell guidance reflecting the lattice geometry of the quasi- 3 D environment by distinct preferences in migration direction. Our findings allow to specifically control amoeboid cell migration by purely topographic effects and thus, to induce active cell guidance. These tools hold prospects for medical applications like improved wound treatment, or invasion assays for immune cells...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} investigating {{the synthesis of}} graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process, {{as well as their}} applications in nanoelectronics and energy conversion/storage. The substantial understanding of interaction of graphene layers between the bio-molecules and gas molecules will enable the improvement in the applications of graphene in bio-sensor and chemical sensor. To achieve these objectives, graphene field effect transistors are fabricated to study the interactions of graphene between single stranded Deoxyribonucleic Acids (ssDNA) and gas molecules. ssDNA is found to act as negative potential gating agent that increases the hole density in single layer graphene (SLG). The molecular photodesorption and absorption from pristine and functionalized graphene are studied. The photodesorption induced current decrease in functionalized graphene by concentrated HNO 3 becomes less significant than pristine graphene layers. We suggest {{this is due to the}} passivation of oxygen-bearing functionalities to CVD grown graphene structure defects via HNO 3 functionalization, which prevents the further absorption of gas molecules. The advance of synthesis of graphene and its hybrid nanostructures by CVD promotes their applications in the industrial level. We synthesize the graphene both on nickel thin film and copper foils by CVD, and investigate the grow kinetics, such as the effect of growth pressure on the uniformity and quality of Cu-grown graphene. By controlling the growth pressure we achieve uniform single layer graphene sheets and suggest the feasible methods of synthesizing uniform few-layer graphene. To decrease the sheet resistance, we stack the single layer graphene using layer-layer transfer technique. Highly concentrated HNO 3 is employed to improve the conductivity and surface wettability of graphene layers. Four-layer graphene films with optical transmittance of 90 % after HNO 3 treatment are applied in organic solar cell as anode. Further, we report the fabrication of highly conductive, large surface-area 3 <b>D</b> <b>pillar</b> graphene nanostructures (PGN) films from assembly of vertically aligned CNT pillars on flexible copper foils and directly employed for the application in electrochemical double layer capacitor (EDLC). The PGN films with MWCNTs on graphene layers, which were one-step synthesized on flexible copper foil (25 um) by CVD process, exhibit high conductivity with sheet resistance as low as 1. 6 Ohm per square and high mechanical flexibility. The fabricated EDLC supercapacitor based on high surface-area PGN electrodes (563 m 2 /g) showed high performance with high specific capacitance of 330 F/g. We demonstrate the synthesis and characterization of three dimensional heterostructures graphene hybrid nanostructures (HGN) comprising continuous large area graphene layers and ZnO nanostructures, fabricated via two-step CVD process. The material characterizations exhibit the highly crystalline ZnO nanostructures synthesized on few-layer graphene film. Ultraviolet spectroscopy and photoluminescence spectroscopy indicate that the CVD grown HGN layers has excellent optical properties. The electrical study on the graphene/ZnO/graphene devices suggests that graphene readily form Ohmic contact to ZnO, although rarely Shockley may exist. The electron transport properties highly depend on the temperature. Devices show photoconductive effect under UV illumination. A combination of electrical and optical properties of graphene and ZnO building blocks in ZnO based HGN provides unique characteristics for opportunities in future optoelectronic devices...|$|E
