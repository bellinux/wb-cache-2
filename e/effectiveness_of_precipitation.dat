For simulated and industrial waste-water, chemical oxygen demand, turbidity, and total sol-ids were reduced over 90, 97, and 95 %, respectively, for all coagulants tested. Protein and fat recoveries were over 95 % for all coagulants. The optimal coagulant concentra-tion for maximum by-product recovery depended on ini-tial wastewater concentrations of protein, total solids, and (Key words: egg processing wastewater, by-product recovery, precipitation or coagulation, nutritional analysis, digestibility...|$|E
40|$|Purpose - Maize {{production}} in China {{is exposed to}} pronounced yield risks, in particular weather risk, {{which is one of}} the most important and least controllable sources of risk in agriculture. The purpose of this paper is to analyze the extent to which weather index-based insurance can contribute to reducing the revenue risk in maize production caused by yield variations. An average farm producing maize is analyzed for each of eight Chinese provinces, six of which are part of the Northern Plains of China. Design/ methodology/ approach - Data are based on the Statistical Yearbook of China and the Chinese Meteorological Administration. The used method of insurance pricing is burn analysis. Hedging <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> index-based insurance is measured by the relative reduction of the standard deviation (SD) and the Value at Risk of maize revenues. Findings - Results reveal that precipitation index-based insurance can cause a reduction of up to 15. 2 percent of the SD and 38. 7 percent of the Value at Risk with a 90 percent confidence level of maize revenues in the study area. However, there are big differences in the hedging efficiencies of precipitation index-based insurance measured at different weather stations in the various provinces. Therefore, it is recommended for insurance providers to analyze the hedging effectiveness of weather index-based insurance with regard to the geographical location of their reference weather station if they would like to offer weather index-based insurance products. Research limitations/ implications - The absence of individual, long-term yield data in the study area prevents the evaluation of risk on individual farms. Thus, the hedging effectiveness can only be analyzed on an aggregated level of yield data and can rather be modeled for an average farm of a particular province. Originality/ value - To the author's knowledge, this paper is the first that investigates the hedging <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> index-based insurance designed for reducing revenue risk of maize {{production in}} eight Chinese provinces...|$|E
40|$|Semi-solid {{processing}} is nowadays an exploited {{technology to}} manufacture complex net shaped structural components; to further improve castings performances more advantages can arise from alloy chemical composition adjustments, {{compared with the}} traditional A 356 and A 357. Aim of this work is the setting up and optimization of an aluminum alloy suitable for semisolid die-casting applications characterized by good castability and proper concentration of hardening elements in the alpha phase {{in order to allow}} strengthening precipitation treatment. The Al-Si-Cu-Mg system, with addition of Ag, has been studied by means of thermodynamic calculation and experimental analyses. The castings have been thermal treated (T 6), varying temperature and duration, and characterized by means of microstructural examinations and microhardness measurements to verify the potential <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> hardening. To complete the optimization of the designed alloy, differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) has been used to evaluate the effect of silver percentage and different heat treatment conditions on the microstructural transformations...|$|E

40|$|This NebFact {{addresses}} how to {{deal with}} an inadequate supply of forage for range beef cattle because of drought. Precipitation can be below average for much of the Nebraska Panhandle and adjoining areas for prolonged periods. Prolonged drought results in an inadequate supply of forage {{for hundreds of thousands of}} beef cattle on millions of acres of rangeland. While some variation occurs among ranches and among pastures within a given ranch, all rangeland vegetation in arid environments like western Nebraska can be moderately to severely damaged by drought stress and/or excessive grazing. Consequently, even if soil moisture is not limited in the years following a drought, spring growth rate will be reduced and total annual forage production can be 20 to 50 percent below average on millions of acres of rangeland. Growth of below-ground plant parts in grasses is proportional to the amount of top growth each year. Combinations of drought-limited plant growth and/or excessive livestock grazing have dramatically reduced root growth, levels of stored energy, and formation of buds needed for future-year tillers. Stocking rates following drought must be reduced at least 20 to 50 percent compared to long-term average pair-days per acre because a larger percentage of the drought year 2 ̆ 7 s plant growth should remain ungrazed to improve the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> In the long run, it will be most cost effective to defer grazing in severely damaged pastures for a full growing season, until after a killing frost or until the following summer. Failure to delay turnout and reduce stocking rates in the year following a drought would be a serious tactical mistake for long-term ranch survival...|$|E
40|$|Many {{attempts}} to assimilate precipitation observations in numerical {{models have been}} made, but they have resulted in little or no forecast improvement {{at the end of}} the precipitation assimilation. This is due to the nonlinearity of the model precipitation parameterization, the non-Gaussianity of precipitation variables, and the large and unknown model and observation errors. In this study, we investigate the assimilation of global large-scale satellite precipitation using the local ensemble transform Kalman filter (LETKF). The LETKF does not require linearization of the model, and it can improve all model variables by giving higher weights in the analysis to ensemble members with better precipitation, so that the model will "remember" the assimilation changes during the forecasts. Gaussian transformations of precipitation are applied to both model background precipitation and observed precipitation, which not only makes the error distributions more Gaussian, but also removes the amplitude-dependent biases between the model and the observations. In addition, several quality control criteria are designed to reject precipitation observations that are not useful for the assimilation. Our ideas are tested in both an idealized system and a realistic system. In the former, observing system simulation experiments (OSSEs) are conducted with a simplified general circulation model; in the latter, the TRMM Multisatellite Precipitation Analysis (TMPA) data are assimilated into a low-resolution version of the NCEP Global Forecasting System (GFS). Positive results are obtained in both systems, showing that both the analyses and the 5 -day forecasts are improved by the effective assimilation of precipitation. We also demonstrate how to use the ensemble forecast sensitivity to observations (EFSO) to analyze the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> assimilation and provide guidance for determining appropriate quality control. These results are very promising for the direct assimilation of satellite precipitation data in numerical weather prediction models, especially with the forthcoming Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) sensors...|$|E
40|$|Agriculture production, {{particularly}} of maize and soybeans, {{is a major}} component of Nebraska’s economy and identity. However, agricultural production in Nebraska faces increasing challenges. One of the challenges is the potential for excessive groundwater depletion due to increased demand for food and fuel from irrigated Nebraska crops and increasing risks of water stress due to climate change. Therefore, it is has become essential for {{a deeper understanding of the}} soil-plant-atmosphere continuum to help producers make more informed management decisions. One of the most important variables is soil moisture. Soil moisture is an integral part of the hydrologic cycle and an essential component in understanding land-atmosphere interactions. Eight years of soil moisture and biophysical measurements from an irrigated and rainfed maize-soybean rotation, in growing seasons that ranged from abnormally dry and warm to unusually moist and cool, add to that understanding. It is shown that soil moisture is an excellent measure of the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation</b> and that timing of precipitation can be as important as quantity. Dry spells occurred in most seasons in the study period, but the timing and duration of said dry spells were important. In seasons where adequate precipitation returned, measured evapotranspiration and gross primary productivity at the rainfed field increased to close to that of the irrigated field. Therefore, it is implied that stomatal conductance seemed to return to close to pre-dry spell levels and rainfed yields were not substantially reduced compared to the irrigated field. However, during a classic flash drought in the study period, prolonged soil moisture stress led to reduced stomatal conductance and significantly reduced maize yields. The flash drought case study not only showed the importance of irrigation during a prolonged dry spell, it also showed the utility of using short-term drought indices for identifying water stress of a rainfed field. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{addition}} of iron salts {{is one of}} the most commonly used dosing strategies for sulfide control in sewers. However, iron salts decrease the sewage pH which not only reduces the <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> sulfide <b>precipitation</b> but also enhances the release of residual sulfide to the sewer atmosphere. Equally important, concentrated iron salt solutions are corrosive and their frequent transport, handling, and on-site storage often come with Occupational Health and Safety (OH&S) concerns. Here, we experimentally demonstrated a novel sulfide control approach using electrochemical systems with parallel placed iron electrodes. This enabled combining anodic dissolved iron species release with cathodic hydroxyl anion production, which alleviates all the aforementioned concerns. A long-term experiment was successfully carried out achieving an average sulfide removal efficiency of 95. 4 ± 4. 4 % at low voltage input of 2. 90 ± 0. 54 V over the course of 8 weeks. This electrochemical method was demonstrated to successfully achieve efficient sulfide control. In addition, it increases the sewage pH, thereby overcoming the drawbacks associated with the pH decrease in the case of conventional iron salt dosing. Ferrous ions were produced at an overall coulombic efficiency (CE) of 98. 2 ± 1. 2 %, whereas oxygen evolution and direct sulfide oxidation were not observed. Short-term experiments showed that increasing either inter-electrode gap or current density increased the cell voltage associated with the increase in the ohmic drop of the system. Overall, this study highlights the practical potential of in-situ generation of dissolved iron species and simultaneous hydroxyl anion generation for efficient sulfide control in sewers...|$|R

40|$|Landslides are {{extremely}} important geomorphic events which sculpt river basin ecosystems by eroding hillslopes and providing sediments to coastal areas. However, {{at the same}} time landslides are hazardous events for socio-ecological systems causing enormous biodiversity, economic, and life losses in developed and in development countries. We propose a statistical spatially-explicit model based on a maximum entropy principle model (MaxEnt) for the prediction of precipitation-triggered landslides at the year-scale. The model is based on landslide occurrences, precipitation patterns, and environmental covariates at the basin-scale. The model predicts the size-distribution and location of over 27, 500 historical landslides for the Arno basin in Italy which is considered as a case study of precipitation-controlled basins. Future landslide patterns are predicted for the A 1 B and A 2 climate precipitation ensembles from 2010 to 2100. The spatial distribution of landslides, their size, and their potential hazard is calculated. The potential landslide-hazard is strongly correlated with the variation of the 12 - and 48 -hour precipitation with return time of 10 years. We assume a homogenous damage function in order to provide an average estimate of the potential hazard of landslides. The potential landslide-hazard is determined by 4 -parameters of the double-Pareto landslide-size distribution: scaling exponents and truncation points of scaling regimes. Thus the landslide-size distribution is an indicator of the geomorphic <b>effectiveness</b> <b>of</b> <b>precipitation.</b> We observed an increase in potential landslide-hazard in the dry period 2040 - 2100 due to the activation of small landslides in remnant sites of past big landslides. On average, as the climate gets wetter the probability of large landslides gets higher. For a + 20 and - 15 mm variation of the 12 -hour precipitation in 2020 and 2100 respectively the potential hazard of landslide is predicted 90 and 20 times higher than in 2011. For the Arno, the A 1 B and A 2 emission scenarios do not produce relevant differences in the predicted landslide patterns, supposedly due to the small scale of the basin with respect to the scale of variability of precipitation. The model is proposed as a valuable risk-assessment tool under climate change scenarios. Further development is needed for calculating heterogeneous damage functions based on real exposure and vulnerability as a function of predictions of socio-ecological systems for the landscape analyzed. Our landslide modeling and assessment of landslide hazard is potentially applicable to any river basin worldwide in which precipitation {{plays a key role in}} landscape evolution...|$|E
