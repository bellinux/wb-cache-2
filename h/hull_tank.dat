25|$|The Combat Vehicle Reconnaissance (Tracked) {{family of}} tracked {{vehicles}} were {{designed in the}} 1960s. The family includes the FV101 Scorpion, FV102 Striker, FV103 Spartan, FV104 Samaritan, FV105 Sultan, FV106 Samson, FV107 Scimitar, FV4333 Stormer, and the Streaker. The first vehicle of this series was the FV101 Scorpion, {{which was the first}} aluminium <b>hull</b> <b>tank</b> ever to be built. The hull and turret are actually fabricated from a welded aluminium-zinc-magnesium alloy. Seventeen Scorpion prototypes were delivered for field testing in February 1969.|$|E

50|$|The Hull Cabin {{was built}} in the late 1880s near the South Rim of the Grand Canyon by settler William Hull. The Hull family arrived in the area in 1880 and {{established}} a ranch in the area, raising sheep and building the <b>Hull</b> <b>Tank,</b> a large earth-banked reservoir for their stock. The Hulls branched out into prospecting and {{were among the first to}} take in tourists heading to the Grand Canyon.|$|E

50|$|In 1893 {{the lands}} {{surrounding}} the Hull property were designated the Grand Canyon Forest Reserve. At some point after 1893 Hull left the area, and the cabins became {{property of the}} Department of the Interior. The cabin site was located near the somewhat boundary between Grand Canyon National Monument and Coconino National Forest, and at various times {{was considered to be}} within either property. However, on February 21, 1907 the cabin and its dependencies were transferred to Coconino National Forest, becoming the <b>Hull</b> <b>Tank</b> Ranger Station. In 1910 the cabin became the <b>Hull</b> <b>Tank</b> Ranger Station, the headquarters for Tusayan National Forest, which was created from Coconino. The forest managed the Grand Canyon area until the creation of the national park in 1919, working from the Hull Cabin in summer and from Anita, Arizona in the winter. Tusayan was incorporated into Kaibab National Forest in 1934., and the cabin became the headquarters of the Tusayan District until 1940, when operations were moved to the Moqui Ranger Station near Tusayan. The cabin's rear extension was added at that time, and probably the stone living room chimney. A 1950 proposal was advanced to include the area around the Hull Cabin in Grand Canyon National Park, but the idea was never pursued.|$|E
5000|$|The LeO H-23 was {{powered by}} a [...] Hispano-Suiza 12N tractor {{configuration}} water-cooled V-12 engine, strut-mounted high above the wing and the cockpit. It was in a long, tapered engine cowling which stretched back almost to the trailing edge but its rectangular honeycomb radiator was immediately behind the propeller, standing proud above the engine. Fuel was in a combination of wing and <b>hull</b> <b>tanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Floating production, storage, and {{offloading}} systems (FPSOS) receive {{crude oil}} from deep-water wells and store {{it in their}} <b>hull</b> <b>tanks</b> until the crude is transferred into tank ships or transport barges. In addition to FPSO’s, {{there have been a}} number of ship-shaped Floating Storage and Offloading (FSO) systems (vessels with no production processing equipment) used in these same areas to support oil and gas developments. An FSO is typically used as a storage unit in remote locations far from pipelines or other infrastructures.|$|R
50|$|On 10-11 June 2002, at an {{additional}} cost of 250,000 dollars, {{the ship was}} rolled onto her starboard side by Resolve Marine Group which pumped air into the port side <b>hull</b> <b>tanks</b> to displace at least 2,000 tons of water, used air bags with 350-400 tons of buoyancy, and two tugboats. On 26 June 2002 the wreck was finally opened to recreational divers. In the next week, over a thousand divers visited the site. There were 50,000 dives a year done on the ship during just the first two years.|$|R
5000|$|The Moqui Ranger Station in Kaibab National Forest near Tusayan, Arizona, {{also known}} as Tusayan Ranger Station, was built in 1939 by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1993 for its architecture, which {{includes}} Bungalow architecture, Rustic architecture, vernacular and other styling. [...] It was designed by the USDA Forest Service. The listing includes institutional housing and government office space in six contributing buildings and one other contributing structure over 2 acre In addition to CCC labor, workers from the Works Progress Administration (WPA) may have also {{been involved in the}} ranger station construction. The station replaced the old <b>Hull</b> <b>Tank</b> Ranger Station.|$|E
50|$|Bay Shipbuilding Company (BSC) is a {{shipyard}} and {{dry dock}} company in Sturgeon Bay, Door County, Wisconsin. As of 2015, Bay Ships was {{a subsidiary of}} Fincantieri Marine Group and produces articulated tug and barges, OPA-90 compliant double <b>hull</b> <b>tank</b> ships and offshore support vessels. It also provides repair services to the lake freighter fleet. In the past the shipyard located in Sturgeon Bay has operated under several different names and traces its history back to 1918. The company also built 40,000 ton Lake freighters in the 1970s and 1980s. While capable of producing large freighters, the yard has not built a freighter over 20,000 tons since 1987. Former names of the shipyards at the 2015 location of Bay Shipbuilding are: Sturgeon Bay Shipbuilding, Leathem D. Smith Shipbuilding Company and Christy Corporation.|$|E
50|$|The small {{historic}} district includes the Hull Cabin, a storage cabin, a barn, a root cellar, and the <b>Hull</b> <b>Tank.</b> The Hull Cabin is constructed of round Ponderosa pine logs, V-notched at the corners. In construction the cabin resembles the Buckey O'Neill Cabin at the South Rim. The cabin {{rests on a}} Coconino sandstone foundation. It measures 37 ft by 27 ft, arranged in a main block with a shed-roofed porch along the front and a perpendicularly gabled ell extending to the rear. The front section comprises a kitchen and a living room, with the bedroom to the rear. The storage cabin measures 16 ft by 18 ft, and is constructed to match the main cabin. It comprises a single concrete-floored room. A root cellar near the storage cabin has collapsed.|$|E

40|$|The {{viscosity}} {{plays an}} important role, and a multiphase solver is necessary to numerically simulate the oil spilling from a damaged double <b>hull</b> <b>tank</b> (DHT). However, it is uncertain whether turbulence modelling is necessary, which turbulence model is suitable; and what the role of compressibility of the fluids is. This paper presents experimental and numerical investigations {{to address these issues}} for various cases representing different scenarios of the oil spilling, including grounding and collision. In the numerical investigations, various approaches to model the turbulence, including the large eddy simulation (LES), direct numerical simulation and the Reynolds average Navier-Stokes equation (RANS) with different turbulence models, are employed. Based on the investigations, it is suggested that the effective Reynolds numbers corresponding to both oil outflow and water inflow shall be considered when classifying the significance of the turbulence and selecting the appropriate turbulence models. This is confirmed by new lab tests considering the axial offset between the internal and the external holes on two hulls of the DHT. The investigations conclude for numerically simulating oil spilling from a damaged DHT that when the effective Re is smaller the RANS approaches should not be used and LES modelling should be employed; while when the effective Reynolds numbers is large, the RANS models may be used as they can give similar results to LES in terms of the height of the mixture in the ballast tank and discharge but costing much less CPU time. The investigation {{on the role of the}} compressibility of the fluid reveals that the compressibility of the fluid may be considerable in a small temporal-spatial scale but plays an insignificant role on macroscopic process of the oil spilling...|$|E

50|$|Only three {{ships were}} built in this group, S-1, S-2 and S-3, using {{partially}} German-supplied machinery. The boats were of semi-double hull type, with riveted pressure hull and welded light hull sections in the superstructure and extremities for improved seaworthiness. The sail was medium-sized and oval in plane, to reduce water drag. It housed the conning tower, the bridge, periscope fairings and a 45 mm (1.77 in) anti-aircraft gun. A net cutter was fitted atop the bow. The hull was separated into seven compartments, three of which were able to withstand 10 atm pressure. Nine main ballast tanks, separated into three groups (4 bow, 2 stern, 3 midships), together with a balancing tank and a quick dive tank {{were placed in the}} light <b>hull.</b> Trimming <b>tanks</b> were inside the pressure <b>hull.</b> Ballast <b>tanks</b> were emptied by pressurized air or engines exhaust, thus removing the need for ballast pumps.|$|R
