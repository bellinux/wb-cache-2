She was asked at one point to fetch water from a nearby well; she complied but stopped to take a drink with an old metal cup she had found lying next to the well. A neighbor of Noreen, who had been involved in a running feud with Noreen's family about some property damage, saw her and angrily told her that it was forbidden for a Christian to drink [...] water from the same utensil from which Muslims drink, {{and some of the other}} workers considered her to be unclean because she was a Christian. Some arguments ensued. Noreen recounts that when they made derogatory statements about her religion, she responded, [...] "I believe in my religion and in Jesus Christ, who died on the cross for the sins of mankind.

500|$|When Congress {{met again}} in December, {{although}} the Judiciary Committee voted 5–4 for impeachment, the House voted against it. On January 13, 1868, the Senate overturned Johnson's suspension of Stanton. [...] Grant resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place. Nevertheless, on February 21, the President ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his place—though Stanton barricaded {{himself in his}} office. These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, [...] "Didn't I tell you so? [...] What good <b>did</b> <b>your</b> moderation do you? [...] If you don't kill the beast, it will kill you." [...] Stevens concluded the debate on a renewed impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health {{he was unable to}} complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud. [...] He accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government, and of ignoring the will of the people. [...] He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but [...] "this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves." [...] The House voted 126–47 to impeach the President.|$|E
500|$|From Molossia, Themistocles {{apparently}} fled to Pydna, {{from where}} he took a ship for Asia Minor. This ship was blown off course by a storm, and ended up at Naxos, which an Athenian fleet {{was in the process}} of besieging. Desperate to avoid identification, Themistocles pestered the captain of the ship to continue the journey immediately. According to Thucydides, who wrote within living memory of the events, the ship eventually landed safely at Ephesus, where Themistocles disembarked. Plutarch has the ship docking at Cyme in Aeolia, and Diodorus has Themistocles making his way to Asia in an undefined manner. Diodorus and Plutarch next recount a similar tale, namely that Themistocles stayed briefly with an acquaintance (Lysitheides or Nicogenes) who was also acquainted with the Persian king, Artaxerxes I. Since there was a bounty on Themistocles's head, this acquaintance devised a plan to safely convey Themistocles to the Persian king in the type of covered wagon that the King's concubines travelled in. All three chroniclers agree that Themistocles's next move was to contact the Persian king; in Thucydides, this is by letter, while Plutarch and Diodorus have a face-to-face meeting with the king. The spirit is, however, the same in all three: Themistocles introduces himself to the king and seeks to enter his service: [...] "I, Themistocles, am come to you, who <b>did</b> <b>your</b> house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was compelled to defend myself against your father's invasion—harm, however, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat, which brought no danger for me but much for him."

2500|$|Indeed, Mailer was outspoken {{about his}} mistrust of {{politics}} in general {{as a way of}} meaningful change in America. [...] In Miami and the Siege of Chicago (1968) he explained his view of [...] "politics-as-property" [...] where he likened politicians to property holders who are [...] "never ambivalent about his land, he does not mock it or see other adjacent estates as more deserving than his own". [...] Thus politics is just people trading their influence as capital in an attempt to serve their own interests. [...] This cynical view of politicians serving only themselves perhaps explains his views on Watergate. [...] Mailer saw politics as a sporting event: [...] "If you played for a team, you <b>did</b> <b>your</b> best to play very well, but there was something obscene… with in starting to think there was more moral worth to Michigan than Ohio State." [...] Mailer thought that Nixon lost and was demonized only because he played for the wrong team. [...] President Johnson on the other hand, Mailer thought, was just as bad as Nixon had been, but he had had good charisma so all was forgiven.|$|E
