A flexible on-line GC method has been developed for kinetic study of catalyzed chemical reactions of hydrogen and oxides of carbon. The single capillary column, temperature programmed method was designed for complete analysis of reactants and products (hydrogen, carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, water, C 1 -C- 10 hydrocarbons, and C 1 -C 6 alcohols) : a sample selection valve is used to switch between either the heated line used for input of the synthesis gases or the heated line used to transport reaction products from the reactor. Sample is introduced to the capillary column by means of a 10 -port heated gas sampling valve with two external <b>injection</b> <b>loops</b> (0. 07 and 1. 95 cm 3); this results in the determination of components over a wide range of concentrations in the sample (ppm to percentage levels).

Reliable methods are needed to consistently analyze perchlorate at low concentration levels. This research investigates the use of solid-phase extraction cartridges {{as an alternative to}} large-volume injection loops to achieve low-level (µg/L level) perchlorate quantitation. The method involves commercially available strong anion exchange (SAX) cartridges. Water samples are filtered (100 to 1000 mL) using the cartridge, which removes the perchlorate from the solution by anion exchange. Then, after the desired volume is filtered, the perchlorate is extracted using 4 mL of 1 % NaOH. In addition, a cleanup method is developed to remove competing anions (chloride, sulfate, and carbonate) that are often found in environmental samples. Analyses are performed with an ion chromatograph using a 10 -µL <b>injection</b> <b>loop,</b> yielding a perchlorate method detection limit (MDL) of 210 µg/L.

40|$|Acute decompensated {{heart failure}} with {{preserved}} ejection fraction (ADHFpEF) is a mounting global health problem, causing a significant burden on acute hospital {{care in the}} developed countries and aging societies. Although being {{the most common cause of}} acute hospital admission in Europe and the United States, this disease remains enigmatic, with little known regarding its pathogenesis, predictors of short-term prognosis and optimal management. This study was a prospective observational study to delineate the haemodynamic changes in ADHFpEF, ascertain the incidence of cardiorenal syndrome, identify predictors of short-term prognosis and compare between continuous infusion and bolus <b>injection</b> of intravenous <b>loop</b> diuretics. Patients admitted to acute medical wards with ADHFpEF were recruited. These patients underwent serial follow-up in the first 48 hours after enrollment, assessed by clinical and biochemical methods, together with trans-thoracic echocardiography to assess haemodynamics and bioimpedance vector analysis (BIVA) to assess fluid status. Subjects were further invited to take part in a randomized trial between continuous infusion and bolus <b>injection</b> of <b>loop</b> diuretics. Novel haemodynamic changes were presented in Chapter 3, showing a significant drop in cardiac output by 0. 59 L min^(- 1) and mean arterial blood pressure by 7 mmHg after 48 hours of treatment. These haemodynamic changes were associated with successful diuresis and decongestion. These findings suggest that diuretic treatment, though effective, can hamper cardiac output and possibly affect other organs. Cardiorenal syndrome was shown to be a common phenomenon in Chapter 4. Within 48 hours, 41 of all 100 patients developed worsening renal function (WRF). Meanwhile, 54 of all 100 patients had an increase in neutrophil gelatinase-associated lipocalin level. Hypervolaemia, defined with BIVA, was associated with a lower chance (odds ratio 0. 31) of developing WRF within first 24 hours. These findings suggest BIVA can be used to identify patients at risk of WRF. Short-term prognosis was addressed in Chapter 5. In the study cohort, 3 patients died and 40 had emergency hospitalization within 60 days after enrollment. In a multivariable regression, both higher baseline BNP (hazards ratio 1. 002) and lower reduction in BNP after 48 hours (hazards ratio 1. 003) were associated with higher risk of reaching endpoint. These findings demonstrate the prognostic value of BNP. Continuous infusion and bolus <b>injection</b> of intravenous <b>loop</b> diuretics were compared in Chapter 6. 96 patients were recruited into the trial, with 47 randomized to infusion arm and 49 to bolus arm. No significant difference was seen in the primary outcome of deaths or emergency hospitalization within 60 days after admission. No difference in the risk of WRF was noted. The infusion armed showed an increase in NGAL after 48 hours whilst the bolus arm showed a decrease (49 ± 90 ng/mL vs. - 5 ± 127 ng/mL). These findings suggest infusion may be associated with renal damage detectable by NGAL but not creatinine. All in all, findings from this study provided novel understanding to ADHFpEF, warranting further investigations to establish the utility of these findings. There remains more work to be done to understand ADHFpEF at a level commensurate with its clinical significance. published_or_final_versionMedicineMasterMaster of Research in Medicin...|$|R

The SEP event on 7 Nov 2013 was observed by both STEREO spacecraft, which were longitudinally separated by 68 at that time.

We examine {{the source of the}} bi-directional SEP distribution at STEREO B. On the one hand this distribution could be caused by a double <b>injection</b> into both <b>loop</b> legs of the MC. On the other hand, a mirroring scenario where the incident beam is reflected in the opposite loop leg could be the reason. Furthermore, the energetic electron observations are used to probe the magnetic structure inside the magnetic cloud.

We apply a GCS model to the coronagraph observations from three viewpoints as well as the Global Magnetic Cloud model to the in situ measurements at STEREO B to determine the orientation and topology of the MC close to the Sun and at 1 AU. We also estimate the path lengths of the electrons propagating through the MC to estimate the amount of magnetic field line winding inside the structure. The relative intensity and timing of the energetic electron increases in the different SEPT telescopes at STEREO B strongly suggest that the bi-directional electron distribution is formed by SEP <b>injections</b> in both <b>loop</b> legs of the MC separately instead of by mirroring farther away beyond the STEREO orbit.

The major difficulty in implementing a homodyne detection system is the generation of a suitable local oscillator signal. This local oscillator signal must be at the same frequency as the received data signal, as well as be phase coherent with it. To accomplish this, a variety of synchronization techniques have been explored, including Optical Phase-Lock <b>Loops</b> (OPLL), Optical <b>Injection</b> Locking (OIL) with both Fabry-Perot and DFB lasers, and an Optical <b>Injection</b> Phase-Lock <b>Loop</b> (OIPLL).

This regenerated local oscillator is at the same frequency, and is phase coherent with, the received optical signal. In addition, we show that the injection locking process can be electronically stabilized by using the modulation transfer ratio of the slave laser as a monitor, given either a DFB or Fabry-Perot slave laser. We show that this stabilization technique maintains injection lock (given a locking range of ~ 1 GHz) for laser drift much greater than what is expected in a typical transmission system. In addition, we explore the quality of the output of the slave laser, and analyze its suitability as a local oscillator signal for a homodyne receiver...|$|R
40|$|The {{response}} of adult rabbit small intestine to the heat-stable (ST) and heat-labile (LT) enterotoxins of Escherichia coli {{has been investigated}} by employing the ligated loop technique. Fluid accumulation was determined in relation to enterotoxin dose and duration of gut exposure. The individual responses to ST and LT differed in a characteristic manner. Onset of net fluid accumulation in response to ST appeared to be immediate even at the lowest dose tested. Onset of net fluid accumulation in response to LT was rapid at high doses but delayed at low doses. Maximum volume per length ratios elicited by ST occurred between 4 and 6 h after <b>injection</b> of <b>loops</b> over {{the entire range of}} doses tested. However, maximum ratios elicited by LT occurred no less than 10 h after injection even at low doses. Fluid accumulation elicited by LT increased in duration with increasing dose; high doses of LT producing a response which was sustained for at least 18 h. The net effect of these differences in reaction characteristics is a sharp increase in the proportion of the cumulative net secretory response attributable to LT with time. Therefore, a 6 -h assay time is appropriate for the titration of ST, whereas an 18 -h assay is not. The 18 -h assay was found more appropriate for toxin-antitoxin neutralization studies since only LT was neutralized by anti-enterotoxin serum. LT of E. coli (swine) strain P- 263 and (human) strain 334 was neutralized by antibody stimulated by enterotoxin from E. coli (human) strain H- 10407. LT was labile to mild acid conditions, whereas ST was not...|$|R
40|$|Tannic acid in {{glutaraldehyde}} fixatives greatly {{enhanced the}} visualization of two developmentally and morphologically distinct stages in {{glomerular basement membrane}} (GBM) formation in newborn rat kidneys. First, in early stage glomeruli, double basement membranes between endothelial cells and podocytes were present and, in certain areas, appeared to be fusing. Second, in maturing stage glomeruli, elaborate loops and outpockets of basement membrane projected into epithelial, but not endothelial, sides of capillary walls. When Lowicryl thin sections from newborn rat kidneys were sequentially labeled with rabbit anti-laminin IgG and anti-rabbit IgG-colloidal gold, gold bound across the full width of all GBMs, including double basement membranes and outpockets. The same distribution was obtained when sections from rats that received intravenous injections of rabbit anti-laminin IgG 1 h before fixation were labeled directly with anti- rabbit IgG-colloidal gold. When kidneys were fixed 4 d after anti- laminin IgG <b>injection,</b> however, <b>loops</b> beneath the podocytes in maturing glomeruli were usually unlabeled and lengths of unlabeled GBM were interspersed with labeled lengths. In additional experiments, rabbit anti-laminin IgG was intravenously injected into newborn rats and, 4 - 14 d later, rats were re-injected with sheep anti-laminin IgG. Sections were then doubly labeled with anti-rabbit and anti-sheep IgG coupled to 10 and 5 nm colloidal gold, respectively. Sheep IgG occurred alone in outpockets of maturing glomeruli and also in lengths of GBM flanked by lengths containing rabbit IgG. These results indicate that, after fusion of double basement membranes, new segments of GBM appear beneath developing podocytes and are subsequently spliced into existing GBM. This splicing provides the additional GBM necessary for expanding glomerular capillaries...|$|R
