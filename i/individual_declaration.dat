The subject of the study was an analysis of the role of public benefit organizations in the context of resting youths in school.

An analysis of the organizational activities of the company and the characteristics of tourist and leisure trips organized by them in the years 2012 - 2017 were analyzed. The results indicate that "Our Union" is an organization with a regional impact covering the central part of Poland.

40|$|Open covers {{have been}} widely {{deployed}} in the London marine insurance market for many years, even though {{a significant number of}} legal issues arising out of their use still needs to be resolved. Not surprisingly, the law concerning open covers is very much alive and open to further development. Given that, quite remarkably, no research study has been done specifically on those particular covers to date; this thesis is aimed at making good that deficiency. To ensure that observation is made over the whole picture in respect of the open covers and to produce a comprehensive guide to the legal complexity arising out of the association between them and their subsequent <b>individual</b> <b>declarations,</b> the complete thesis will comprise five chapters: 60 l Chapter 1 will provide historical information and development background of open covers and also will set out the main differences in the operation of floating policies and open covers which were derived originally from the former. Chapter 2 will illustrate (1) how and why the legal nature of an open cover impacts on the parties' rights, obligations, privileges and immunities, and (2) how and why the formation of an open cover {{plays a key role in}} the determination of proper nature. Chapter 3 will shed light on the applicability of the duty of utmost good faith to open covers by explaining the doctrine of utmost good faith within the general law of insurance and then clarifying whether the duty is enforceable pertaining to the covers themselves or only pertaining to subsequent policies individually. Chapter 4 will explore the agency status of insurance brokers in the context of open covers. To this end, it focuses, first, upon giving the general definition of insurance broking, secondly, describing the use and performance of the brokers in the procurement process, currency and claims process of open covers, and lastly the measure of damages recoverable from the brokers. Chapter 5 will discuss conflict of laws in open covers, and in particular problems of jurisdiction and choice of law where the open cover and declarations under it are potentially governed by different regimes. Finally, the legal and practical issues that have been identified, and their suggested solutions will be summarised in the conclusion. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|The {{concepts}} of »honor«, »dignity« and »human rights« {{are discussed in}} this paper is »honor« a »feudal concept« which {{has no place in}} modern society? Out of the ruins of the concept of honor, hasn’t the concept of human dignity arisen, a concept which does not have its foundation in social institutions but rather in the self-consciousness of the independent personality? Along with the integrity and dignity of the <b>individual</b> go <b>declarations</b> on human rights which are a doubtless attainment of bourgeois society. These are freedom, the striving for happiness, the inviolability of the personality, protection {{in the face of the}} pressure of authority, free speech and press. In many socialist societies, not only is this heritage endangered, but also the very basis upon which it rests, the right to human life, brutally abolished. Neither the sanctity of the personality accused at the time of investigation nor the right to professional defense counsel is recognized. In this manner,the right to life is not a right, but rather life is only a consequence of the good will of those who rule. Furthermore, in contemporary bourgeois society, the right to different opinions and actions is more and more curbed. This is not merely a matter of the monopoly of the state on the use of violence, but also of a monopoly on truth. This is a situation in which resistance unavoidably also follows the form of violence. At the end, it is concluded that pride, honor and dignity are inalienable human traits which gain in importance the more general control and repression grow and become stronger...|$|R

Against the self-sufficient <b>individual</b> of the <b>Declaration</b> of the Rights of Man, the organicists claimed to bring the support of science to the primacy of the social bond. For these authors, the natural human state was that of association. As Worms put it in a critique of the contract theory: [...] "Men did not need to associate themselves, they were born associated, and they remained so." [...] Psychological and moral capacities developed through this association; in other words, humans owed their consciousness and their capacity for relative autonomy to society. Individuality as it was known and prized in modern society was a product of society. Lilienfeld stated this as a simple fact: [...] "The intellectual and moral faculties of man are exclusively the product of social life." [...] The organicists believed this should settle the conflict between individual liberty and social solidarity; humans would come to realize their strict dependence on the collective (Barberis 2003: 62).|$|R

Nor are we bound by any expressions in the Constitution, as some have strangely supposed, either not to punish at all, or to punish indiscriminately the like attacks upon the religion of Mahomet or of the Grand Lama, and for this plain reason, that the case assumes {{that we are a}} Christian people, and the morality of the country is deeply engrafted upon Christianity, and not upon the doctrines or worship of those impostors.If we pass beyond these matters to a view of American life, as expressed by its laws, its business, its customs, and its society, we find everywhere a clear recognition of the same truth. Among other matters, note the following: the form of oath universally prevailing, concluding with an appeal to the Almighty; the custom of opening sessions of all deliberative bodies and most conventions with prayer; the prefatory words of all wills, [...] "In the name of God, amen"; the laws respecting the observance of the Sabbath, with the general cessation of all secular business, and the closing of courts, legislatures, and other similar public assemblies on that day; the churches and church organizations which abound in every city, town, and hamlet; the multitude of charitable organizations existing everywhere under Christian auspices; the gigantic missionary associations, with general support, and aiming to establish Christian missions in every quarter of the globe. These, and many other matters which might be noticed, add a volume of unofficial declarations to the mass of organic utterances that this is a Christian nation. In the face of all these, shall it be believed that a Congress of the United States intended to make it a misdemeanor for a church of this country to contract for the services of a Christian minister residing in another nation?There is no dissonance in these declarations.

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 70 - 72). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Old English heroic literature frequently deals with the tension surrounding a combat decision, or the decision to enter into avoidable, mortal combat. The combat decision figures prominently in the poems Beowulf, the Battle of Maldon, and in the entry in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle known as "AD 755 " or "Cynewulf and Cyneheard. " Old English scholars such as Rosemary Woolf and John M. Hill have noted that the tensions in these poems are not resolved by simple reference to a monolithic "Anglo-Saxon Warrior Code" alleged to stretch from the descriptions in the Germania by Tacitus to the end of Anglo-Saxon control of England in 1066. Hill in particular has noted that the comitatus relationship between lord and retainer is depicted with often-overlooked differences in remaining Old English texts, particularly concerning the concept of suicidal loyalty to the lord in situations involving a combat decision. This thesis examines the motivating factors involved in the combat decision, beginning with a close reading of Tacitus and examining the lord-retainer bond as it impacts the combat decision in different stages of the prevailing concept of loyalty and the understanding of the heroic code. Paying particular attention to oaths and boasting, where words and deeds are explicitly linked, reveals that the relationship between declaration and action, sign and signification, is critical to the decision to enter into avoidable mortal combat. Close inspection of the form of the heroic boast, and examples in Beowulf and Maldon, suggest that the most significant contributing factor in the combat decision is the individual's concept of personal identity, bound up in the epistemological question of the "weight" of an <b>individual's</b> words and <b>declarations...</b>|$|R
