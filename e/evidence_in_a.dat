5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. His refusal to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|Mephedrone may be quantitated in blood, plasma or urine by gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry {{to confirm}} {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalised patients or to provide <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medicolegal death investigation. Blood or plasma mephedrone concentrations {{are expected to be}} in a range of 50–100 μg/l in persons using the drug recreationally, >100 μg/l in intoxicated patients and >500 μg/l in victims of acute overdosage.|$|E
5|$|Polonium-210 may be {{quantified}} in biological specimens by alpha particle spectrometry to confirm {{a diagnosis of}} poisoning in hospitalized patients or to provide <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> medicolegal death investigation. The baseline urinary excretion of polonium-210 in healthy persons due to routine exposure to environmental sources is normally {{in a range of}} 5–15 mBq/day. Levels in excess of 30 mBq/day are suggestive of excessive exposure to the radionuclide.|$|E

5|$|Wife selling {{persisted in}} England {{in some form}} until the early 20th century; {{according}} to the jurist and historian James Bryce, writing in 1901, wife sales were still occasionally taking place during his time. In {{one of the last}} reported instances of a wife sale in England, a woman giving <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> Leeds police court in 1913 claimed that she had been sold to one of her husband's workmates for £1.|$|E
5|$|McCarthy's {{judicial}} career attracted {{some controversy}} {{because of the}} speed with which he dispatched many of his cases as he worked to clear the heavily backlogged docket he had inherited. Wisconsin had strict divorce laws, but when McCarthy heard divorce cases, he expedited them whenever possible, and he made the needs of children involved in contested divorces a priority. When it came to other cases argued before him, McCarthy compensated for his lack of experience as a jurist by demanding and relying heavily upon precise briefs from the contesting attorneys. The Wisconsin Supreme Court reversed a low percentage of the cases he heard, but he was also censured in 1941 for having lost <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> price fixing case.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} was {{directed}} by Colombian film director Simon Brand, in Los Angeles between April 6 and April 8, 2001, and was choreographed by Dan Karaty. Shot in a set with futuristic backdrops, Simpson assumes {{the role of a}} spy on a mission in the video. It begins with Simpson exiting a helicopter then entering a building to compromise <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> laboratory there. Simpson takes the elevator which opens onto a pathway. While she is walking, a gadget appears on the floor followed by a small explosion. In the next scene, Simpson walks through a water tunnel, out of which she is pulled by a robotic hand. As the video progresses, Simpson is shown dancing {{in a room full of}} mirrors. Scenes of ninjas climbing up a rope hanging from top of the building are inter-cut with scenes of Simpson dancing until the laboratory explodes. Simpson is next shown dancing on the rooftop alongside the ninjas before a helicopter arrives and Simpson boards it.|$|E
25|$|The Saudi Constitution {{does not}} provide for a right to privacy. The {{government}} can, with a court order, search homes, vehicles, places of business and intercept private communications.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the Evidence Verification Algorithm (EVA) in this paper, which verifies consistency of life cycles of ev-idences (<b>evidence</b> documents) <b>in</b> workflow diagrams. We used the AIST Workflow Language (AWL) as the syntax for workflow diagrams, which has {{additional information about}} evidences. A workflow diagram of AWL {{is essentially the same}} as a Unified Modeling Language (UML) activity dia-gram. EVA verifies the existence of consistent sequences of flows between the occurrences of <b>evidences</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workflow diagram. It is important to verify consistency of life cycles of evidences, since some defects in the workflow diagram itself can be found by checking inconsistent life cycles of <b>evidences</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> workflow diagram...|$|R

25|$|This is {{the highest}} {{standard}} used as {{the burden of proof}} in Anglo-American jurisprudence and typically only applies in criminal proceedings and when considering aggravating circumstances in criminal proceedings. It has been described, in negative terms, as a proof having been met if there is no plausible reason to believe otherwise. If there is a real doubt, based upon reason and common sense after careful and impartial consideration of all the evidence, or lack of <b>evidence,</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case, then the level of proof has not been met.|$|E

25|$|Proof {{beyond a}} {{reasonable}} doubt, therefore, is proof of such a convincing character that one {{would be willing to}} rely and act upon it without hesitation in the most important of one's own affairs. However, it does not mean an absolute certainty. The standard that must be met by the prosecution's <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> criminal prosecution is that no other logical explanation can be derived from the facts except that the defendant committed the crime, thereby overcoming the presumption that a person is innocent unless and until proven guilty.|$|E
25|$|If the {{business}} information {{was produced in}} the course of a domestic criminal investigation, then either one of the above five categories (for absent witnesses) must apply, or the person producing the statement cannot be expected now to have any recollection of the original information. A typical example of this is doctor's notes in relation to an injured person, which is then adduced as medical <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> criminal trial. Previous criminal records can be adduced (if otherwise admissible) under this section, but not normally any further details about the method of commission, unless it can be demonstrated that the data inputter had the appropriate personal knowledge.|$|E
25|$|In September 2017, Zach Adams was {{the first}} to go on trial. The prosecution's case was largely circumstantial, as there was no DNA or other {{forensic}} evidence tying Zach to the murder. Jason Autry, the state's key witness, testified to a series of events that was drastically different from Dylan's confession. He testified that he himself was not involved in the abduction, but that he went to Shayne Austin's home to buy drugs where he saw Zach, Dylan, and Shayne disposing of evidence from the crime. He said Zach had a body {{in the back of his}} truck wrapped up in a multi-colored blanket and Shayne was disposing of <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> burn barrel.|$|E

25|$|There were 25 public {{cases in}} 2012 in which former and current {{government}} officials {{were accused of}} illicit enrichment. In September 2013, Ricardo Jaime, who had been Kirchner's Transportation Secretary, was given a six-month suspended sentence on charges of withholding <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> case of unjust enrichment. Ombudsman Eduardo Mondino told U.S. Ambassador Earl Anthony Wayne in 2011 about allegations that the Argentine government charged a 15% commission on all private international contracts, and wanted Wayne to help {{find out whether the}} earnings were being deposited in a U.S. bank. A German CEO also told Planning Minister Julio De Vido that one of the latter's aides had asked him for a bribe.|$|E
25|$|Law {{enforcement}} {{have used}} mobile phone <b>evidence</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> {{number of different}} ways. Evidence about the physical location of an individual {{at a given time}} can be obtained by triangulating the individual's cellphone between several cellphone towers. This triangulation technique can be used to show that an individual's cellphone was at a certain location at a certain time. The concerns over terrorism and terrorist use of technology prompted an inquiry by the British House of Commons Home Affairs Select Committee into the use of evidence from mobile phone devices, prompting leading mobile telephone forensic specialists to identify forensic techniques available in this area. NIST have published guidelines and procedures for the preservation, acquisition, examination, analysis, and reporting of digital information present on mobile phones can be found under the NIST Publication SP800-101.|$|E
25|$|The Ohio Elections Commission {{issued a}} split {{decision}} on the case, failing to find {{that all of the}} preceding three remarks had been published in violation of ORC 3517.21(B)(10) by clear and convincing <b>evidence.</b> <b>In</b> <b>a</b> series of 4 panel votes, Commissioners affirmed that Turkish American funds are a primary source of support for Rep. Schmidt’s political campaign, but chided Krikorian for statements related to Turkish Government funding of his opponent, because such a funding would be illegal. The votes were taken after a panel decision to disregard testimony provided regarding the Armenian Genocide and its denial, which was criticized by David Krikorian's party and supporters. Schmidt also attempted, to no avail, to press criminal charges against Krikorian for his statements. Sibel Edmonds, a former FBI translator, testified on behalf of Krikorian during the Ohio Elections Commission hearing and spoke about Turkey's connections to Jean Schmidt.|$|E
