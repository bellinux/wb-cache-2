5|$|Adams {{was sworn}} into office as the nation's second {{president}} on March 4, 1797, by Chief Justice Oliver Ellsworth. As president, he followed Washington's lead {{in using the}} presidency to exemplify republican values and civic virtue; and his service was free of scandal. He continued to strengthen the central government by expanding the Navy and Army. In July 1798 Adams signed into law the Act for the Relief of Sick and Disabled Seamen, which authorized {{the establishment of a}} government-operated marine <b>hospital</b> <b>service.</b>|$|E
5|$|Several {{times in}} 1912, amidst an {{outbreak}} of bubonic plague in the Caribbean, Havana operated in violation of Cuban and U.S. quarantine rules. In July 1912, the liner prepared to depart Cuba without an inspection and fumigation, but faced the prospect of seven days quarantine in Havana before the ship {{would be allowed to}} depart. However, a compromise was worked out by the United States Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> which allowed Havana to depart after a one-day delay. In September of the same year, another inspection gaffe resulted in government prosecution of the Ward Line.|$|E
5|$|The Pacific Tower, {{formerly}} the Pacific Medical Center, is a 16-story building on Beacon Hill in Seattle, Washington. It {{is located at}} 120012thAvenueSouth. It was completed in 1932 and opened in 1933 as a Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> facility. The lower floors of the facility still function as a medical center today. Amazon.com occupied much of the building as its headquarters for several years. Much of the space was left vacant after Amazon relocated to South Lake Union. In 2013, the State of Washington agreed to a 30-year lease of 13 floors. Seattle Central Community College subleases six floors for its healthcare training program.|$|E

40|$|This {{project is}} {{a study of the}} {{intended}} impact of the introduction of rate management (takststyring), including the DRG system, and its contribution to meet the political objectives in respect of enhancing the efficiency in the Danish <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> system. The political objectives comprise several areas, all of which {{have an impact on the}} efficiency in the <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> system; activity, productivity, expenses, quality, treatment composition and length of waiting lists. From a perspective comprising the development of the Danish <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> system over the past ten years and the way in which it is possible to perform management in a public institution, like the Danish <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> system, it is evaluated that the objectives have indeed been met via changed management from the exclusive use of framework management (rammestyring) to the simultaneous use of both framework management and rate management. We can thus conclude that rate management has contributed to enhancing the efficiency in the Danish public <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> system...|$|R
40|$|Background: Self-rated {{health is}} a {{subjective}} measure {{that has been}} related to indicators such as mortality, morbidity, functional capacity, {{and the use of}} health services. In Spain, there are few longitudinal studies associating self-rated health with <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> use. The {{purpose of this study is}} to analyze the association between self-rated health and socioeconomic, demographic, and health variables, and the use of <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> among the general population in the Region of Valencia, Spain. Methods: Longitudinal study of 5, 275 adults who were included in the 2005 Region of Valencia Health Survey and linked to the Minimum Hospital Data Set between 2006 and 2009. Logistic regression models were used to calculate the odds ratios between use of <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> and self-rated health, sex, age, educational level, employment status, income, country of birth, chronic conditions, disability and previous use of <b>hospital</b> <b>services.</b> Results: By the end of a 4 -year follow-up period, 1, 184 participants (22. 4 %) had used <b>hospital</b> <b>services.</b> Use of <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> was associated with poor self-rated health among both men and women. In men, it was also associated with unemployment, low income, and the presence of a chronic disease. In women, it was associated with low educational level, the presence of a disability, previous <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> use, and the presence of chronic disease. Interactions were detected between self-rated health and chronic disease in men and between self-rated health and educational level in women. Conclusions: Self-rated health acts as a predictor of <b>hospital</b> <b>services</b> use. Various health and socioeconomic variables provide additional predictive capacity. Interactions were detected between self-rated health and other variables that may reflect different complex predictive models, by gender...|$|R
5|$|The {{building}} was opened in 1933 by the U.S. {{government as a}} United States Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> hospital. Replacing a facility in Port Townsend, it opened with 312 beds in 1933. The hospital originally served veterans, merchant seamen, the US Coast Guard, the US Lighthouse Service, and poor and indigent people defined as “federal compensation cases”. In 1951, it was re-designated as a US Public Health Service facility along with all other Marine hospitals. In 1953, a three-story annex was constructed on {{the east end of}} the building to serve outpatient clinics. Two stair towers were added to the south face in 1975. The building continued to grow in 1980 as a laboratory and primary care addition were built. The federal government ceased operation of the facility and other similar hospitals in 1981. Control was shifted to Seattle, and the city chartered the Pacific Hospital Preservation and Development Authority(PHPDA). The PHPDA owns the property and uses long-term tenants with leases. Lease revenues are advance the PHPDA’s mission of providing health care services to low-income uninsured and under-insured persons in King County. The lease agreement with WRC.Com Tower LLC was signed in 1998 and was terminated in 2012.|$|E

In October 1911, in {{addition}} to reapplying to the army, Howard also applied to the Public Health and Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service.</b> Officers were only selected from the pool of applicants twice per year, {{so it was not}} until April 1912 that he went before a board of examiners. Knox scored an average of 84.99 percent, which led to his appointment with the Public Health and Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> in New York City. In May he was assigned to work in the immigration station at Ellis Island.|$|E

25|$|Hamilton's wartime {{experiences}} exerted their influence, drawing {{him from}} private medical practice into a commission as an Assistant Surgeon in the United States Army (1874) {{and after he}} resigned from the Army, into the Regular Corps of the Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> (MHS). In 1876, the 24-year-old Hamilton sat for the first examination for entrance into MHS, passed with flying colors, and was commissioned as an Assistant Surgeon on Oct 21, 1876. His talent in public health practice revealed itself early, during an 1877 assignment to the Boston Marine Hospital at Chelsea, Massachusetts. Changing land use in the area had blocked hospital sewage from draining properly, causing unexpected outbreaks of infectious disease among patients. Hamilton resolved the crisis successfully by directing a renovation of the facility's drainage and sewage systems.|$|E
25|$|The act, as {{currently}} structured, does not cut present Medicare benefits. It reduces projected future increases in Medicare spending such as inpatient <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> payments and ambulatory care payments {{that would otherwise}} undergo annual re-adjustments. These changes would save $196 billion from Medicare over 10 years and removing wasteful subsidies to insurers for Medicare Advantage plan would save a further $156 billion according to the CBO. Gail Wilensky, a deputy assistant to President Bush Snr advising him on health and welfare issues from 1992–1993 and previously a director of Medicare and Medicaid has expressed concern that this might affect seniors {{access to health care}} if the changes are made too quickly, while other activists such as Stuart Guterman of the Commonwealth Fund argue that Medicare Advantage plans cost the taxpayer $1,000 per policyholder more than if the person had been insured through traditional fee for services.|$|E

25|$|Immediately upon {{receiving}} his degree, Moscati {{joined the}} staff of the Ospedale degli Incurabili, eventually becoming an administrator. During this time he continued to study, conducting medical research when not performing his duties at the hospital. Already recognized for his commitment to his duties, he won further recognition for his actions {{in the aftermath of the}} eruption of Mount Vesuvius on 8 April 1906. One of the hospitals for which Moscati was responsible, at Torre del Greco, was located a few miles from the volcano's crater. Many of its patients were elderly, and many were paralytics as well. Moscati oversaw the evacuation of the building, getting them all out just before the roof collapsed due to the ash. He sent a letter to the general director of the Neapolitan <b>hospital</b> <b>service,</b> insisting on thanking those who had helped in the evacuation, yet not mentioning his own name.|$|E
25|$|After the battle, {{thousands}} of wounded men flooded into Louisville. Hospitals {{were set up}} in public schools, homes, factories and churches. The Fifth Ward School, built at 5th and York Streets in 1855, became Military Hospital Number Eight. The United States Marine Hospital also became a hospital for the wounded Union soldiers from the battle of Perryville. Constructed between 1845 and 1852, the three-story Greek revival style Louisville Marine Hospital contained one hundred beds. It became the prototype for seven U.S. Marine <b>Hospital</b> <b>Service</b> buildings, including Paducah, Kentucky, which later became Fort Anderson. Union surgeons erected the Brown General Hospital, located near the Belknap campus of the University of Louisville, and other hospitals were erected at Jeffersonville and New Albany, Indiana. By early 1863, the War Department and the U.S. Sanitary Commission erected nineteen hospitals. By early June 1863, 930 deaths had been recorded in the Louisville hospitals. Cave Hill Cemetery set aside plots for the Union dead.|$|E

2500|$|Many {{hospitals}} were {{developed during the}} early Islamic era. They were called Bimaristan, or Dar al-Shifa, the Persian and Arabic words both meaning [...] "house [...] of the sick." [...] The idea of a hospital being {{a place for the}} care of sick people was taken from the early Caliphs. [...] The bimaristan is seen as early as the time of Muhammad, and the Prophet's mosque in the city of Madinah held the first Muslim <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> in its courtyard. During the Ghazwah Khandaq (the Battle of the Trench), Muhammad came across wounded soldiers and he ordered a tent be assembled to provide medical care. Over time, Caliphs and rulers expanded traveling bimaristans to include doctors and pharmacists.|$|E
2500|$|Tauber {{constructed}} the luxurious Hotel Majestic on the site, retaining Queen Isabella's bathroom accoutrements, including her marble bath, in the Presidential suite. Designed by Armand Sibien, construction began in 1906 {{and the hotel}} opened in December 1908. The hotel was purchased by Henry Devenish Harben {{for use as a}} military hospital at the outbreak of World War I in 1914, and served in this capacity for five months. It was damaged during its <b>hospital</b> <b>service,</b> and was not renovated and reopened until 1916. In 1922 it was the site of a famous dinner hosted by Violet and Sydney Schiff and attended by Marcel Proust, Igor Stravinsky and Pablo Picasso. The [...] "dinner party of the century": was immortalised in Richard Davenport-Hines's book, [...] "Proust at the Majestic: The Last Days of the Author Whose Book Changed Paris". The 1st unofficial Chess Olympiad was held at the hotel in 1924. George Gershwin wrote An American in Paris while staying at the hotel in 1928.|$|E
2500|$|It was for {{his service}} in the Great War that Dunn was knighted in the 1921 New Year's List of Honours. Dunn functioned {{as a sort of}} secret agent for two Prime Ministers, many years before Ian Fleming {{conceived}} of James Bond. He first rose to the occasion when Asquith asked him (and members of the Asquith family) in the autumn of 1914 to write a report on the Army <b>hospital</b> <b>service</b> behind the lines in France. Next, he negotiated with Jacob Borreson an agreement that all of the nickel mined by the Kristiansand Nickel Company of Norway would be sent to Canada for smelting and refining. The British government obtained a virtual blockade on the supply of nickel to Germany, who were forced to purchase nickel from afar (with all the risk entailed by a distant supply) at inflated [...] "spot" [...] prices. LLoyd George requested a situation report from Dunn on the disrupted supply of foodstuffs from Norway, Sweden and Denmark; Dunn's plans for increasing the supply were sound and worked admirably in practice.|$|E
