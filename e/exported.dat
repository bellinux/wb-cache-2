40|$|This paper {{examines}} the structural competitiveness of oil-rich economies in sub-Saharan Africa {{relative to other}} major oil-exporting developing countries, and investigates reasons for systematic differences in the non-oil <b>export</b> performance across these economies. The analysis reveals that oil-rich Africa lags behind other oil-exporters in terms of diversification, global market share and the overall investment climate. The poor performance of their nonoil sector can be largely attributed to weak infrastructure and institutional quality. The results also show that institutional quality is a significant determinant {{of the extent to}} which oil abundance affects the competitiveness of the non-oil sector; thereby explaining the divergent experiences of oil-rich economies across the world. This implies that oil wealth does not necessarily weaken the non-oil tradable sector; countries may mitigate the impact of Dutch disease and benefit from oil booms if revenues are used prudently to reduce oil dependence.

First, concentration by geographic destination is considered; that is, whether the bulk of <b>exports</b> from a country go to many or few trading partners. Second, industry/sectoral concentration is considered; that is, whether a country’s <b>exports</b> are scattered across many industries and sectors, or concentrated in just a few. Third, product concentration is considered; that is, whether countries produce many products within their <b>export</b> sectors or just a few. The workhorse gravity trade model is adapted with trade diversification as an additional trade cost, and the model solution is empirically tested on a dataset containing over 500 thousand observations for Latin America. Industry and product concentration are found to significantly affect the resilience of Latin American countries’ trade during the global financial crisis - increasing the diversity of both <b>export</b> sectors and <b>export</b> products within sectors by one standard deviation reduces the quarterly decline in <b>exports</b> by approximately 4. 7 percent. Diversifying <b>exports</b> across many different trading partners is not found to significantly affect outcomes.

Between 1850 and 1950, 450,000tons of gum were <b>exported.</b> The peak in the gum market was 1899, with 11,116tons <b>exported</b> that year, with a value of £600,000 ($989,700).

40|$|This paper reexamines Korea''s trade flows. Using the {{standard}} demand-based models, the paper finds that {{owing to the}} increasing share of electrical and electronic products (EEPs) in total <b>exports,</b> the income elasticity of the Korean <b>export</b> demand has fallen sharply while its price elasticity has risen dramatically. This is a curious result, which begs the question of why. Accordingly, an alternative supply-based model shows that the sharp increase in <b>exports</b> of EEPs is mainly due to Korea''s remarkable ability to make technological improvements in their production. After reestimating {{the standard}} import equation, the paper finds estimates similar to those from previous studies. Since most of these imports are industrial inputs, they are jointly determined by consumption, fixed investment, and <b>exports.</b> Trade policy;Economic models;equations, heteroscedasticity, <b>export</b> volume, <b>export</b> demand, autocorrelation, equation, logarithm, independent variables, standard errors, total <b>exports,</b> <b>export</b> supply, trade flows, homoscedasticity, constant term, supply equations, <b>export</b> unit, rate of change, elasticity of <b>export,</b> share of <b>exports,</b> functional form, <b>export</b> equations, goods for <b>export,</b> total <b>export,</b> statistics, manufactured <b>exports,</b> <b>export</b> prices, <b>export</b> production, <b>export</b> equation, world <b>exports,</b> minimization, real <b>exports,</b> econometrics, import prices, real effective exchange rate, financial statistics, value of <b>exports,</b> empirical model, price of <b>exports...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} {{in this paper}} suggests that import and <b>export</b> volume elasticities are markedly lower in oil-exporting Middle East and Central Asian countries than in non-oil countries in the region. A key implication of this finding is that a real appreciation of the exchange rate in oil-exporting countries would achieve little in terms of expenditure switching: an appreciation does not boost imports and non-oil <b>exports</b> constitute only a small share of GDP and total trade in these countries. Therefore, while a real appreciation lowers the current account surplus of oil-exporting countries through valuation effects, the contribution to lowering global imbalances may be more limited.

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the evolution}} of Chile''s trade between 1990 and 2007, studying in particular the impact of trade liberalization in addition to traditional price and demand determinants. The results show that <b>export</b> and import flows are mainly responsive to external and domestic demand, and less so to relative prices, {{although there is a}} small impact on imports. In addition, the analysis suggests that trade liberalization may {{have played a role in}} increasing <b>exports</b> and imports. Estimations of trade elasticities for other countries in Latin America tend to confirm the results found for Chile.
