5|$|A patient's genome {{may include}} an {{inherited}} or random mutation which affects {{the probability of}} developing a disease in the future. For example, Lynch syndrome is a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> that predisposes patients to colorectal and other cancers; early detection can lead to close monitoring that improves the patient's chances of a good outcome. Cardiovascular risk is indicated by biological markers and screening can measure the risk that a child will be born with a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> such as Cystic fibrosis. Genetic testing is ethically complex: patients may not want the stress of knowing their risk. In countries without universal healthcare, a known risk may raise insurance premiums.|$|E
5|$|Since {{the tight}} control of enzyme {{activity}} {{is essential for}} homeostasis, any malfunction (mutation, overproduction, underproduction or deletion) of a single critical enzyme {{can lead to a}} <b>genetic</b> <b>disease.</b> The malfunction of just one type of enzyme out of the thousands of types present in the human body can be fatal. An example of a fatal <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> due to enzyme insufficiency is Tay-Sachs disease, in which patients lack the enzyme hexosaminidase.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{endocrine}} diseases involve dysfunctions of the adrenal gland. Overproduction of cortisol leads to Cushing's syndrome, whereas insufficient production {{is associated with}} Addison's disease. Congenital adrenal hyperplasia is a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> produced by dysregulation of endocrine control mechanisms. A variety of tumors can arise from adrenal tissue and are commonly found in medical imaging when searching for other diseases.|$|E
40|$|Abstract The {{biomedical}} world {{relies heavily}} on the definition of pharmaceutical targets as an essential step in the drug design process. It is therefore tempting to apply this model to <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> as well. However, whereas the model applies well to gain-of-function <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases,</b> it is less suited to most loss-of-function <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases.</b> Most common diseases, as well as gain-of-function <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases,</b> are characterized by the activation of specific pathways or the ectopic activity of proteins, which make well identified targets. By contrast, loss-of-function <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> are caused by the impairment of one protein, with potentially distributed consequences. For such diseases, {{the definition of a}} pharmaceutical target is less precise, and the identification of pharmaceutically-relevant targets may be difficult. This critical but largely ignored aspect of loss-of-function <b>genetic</b> <b>diseases</b> should be taken into consideration to avoid the commitment of resources to inappropriate strategies in the search for treatments. </p...|$|R

5|$|Hemingway's {{behavior}} during his final {{years had been}} {{similar to that of}} his father's before he killed himself; his father may have had the <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> hemochromatosis, due to which the inability to metabolize iron culminates in mental and physical deterioration. Medical records made available in 1991 confirm that Hemingway had been diagnosed with hemochromatosis in early 1961. His sister Ursula and his brother Leicester also killed themselves. In addition to being affected by his physical ailments, Hemingway's health was compromised by his having been a heavy drinker for most of his life.|$|E
5|$|Hip {{dysplasia}} (HD) is {{a common}} <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> that affects Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It is not present at birth but develops with age. Hip dysplasia is diagnosed by X-rays, {{but it is not}} usually evident in X-rays of Cavaliers until they mature. Even in adult spaniels with severe HD, X-rays may not always indicate the disease. In a series of evaluations by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals, the Cavalier was ranked 78th worst out of 157 breeds. The worst affected breeds were the Bulldog, Pug and Dogue de Bordeaux.|$|E
5|$|Nasodigitoacoustic {{syndrome}} {{is thought to}} be caused by a mutation in a gene on the X chromosome. A 2007 study concluded, based on analysis of microsatellite markers (small gene sequences found in common among individuals having the same ethnicity, ancestry or <b>genetic</b> <b>disease)</b> of the family described by Keipert, that this gene was likely located on the long arm of the X chromosome between positions Xq22.2q28. This is not definitive, however, and no specific gene has been named.|$|E

5|$|Psoriasis is {{generally}} {{thought to be}} a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> that is triggered by environmental factors. In twin studies, identical twins are {{three times more likely to}} be affected compared to non-identical twins. This suggests that genetic factors predispose to psoriasis. Symptoms often worsen during winter and with certain medications, such as beta blockers or NSAIDs. Infections and psychological stress can also play a role. Psoriasis is not contagious. The underlying mechanism involves the immune system reacting to skin cells. Diagnosis is typically based on the signs and symptoms.|$|E

5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} diseases, inflammatory diseases and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune diseases include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E

Phlox makes the startling discovery that the Valakians are slowly dying out, not from an easily curable medical condition, but because of a <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> which is experiencing an accelerated rate of mutation. He also believes that the answer to a cure may lie in the Menk.|$|E
5|$|The Dales pony is one {{of three}} breeds known to be a carrier of the fatal <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> foal {{immunodeficiency}} syndrome (FIS). FIS is a recessive disease; affected foals are born when they inherit the gene from both parents. Foals with FIS appear normal when born, but have a compromised immune system and anemia, leading to untreatable infections and death within three months. Following the development of a genetic test in 2010, 12% of Dales ponies tested in the UK were found to be carriers. The use of genetic testing has allowed breeders to avoid mating two carrier animals, so that the disease is avoided in foals.|$|E

5|$|The {{history of}} {{tuberous}} sclerosis (TSC) research spans less than 200 years. TSC is a rare, multi-system <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> {{that can cause}} benign tumours to grow on the brain or other vital organs such as the kidneys, heart, eyes, lungs, and skin. A combination of symptoms may include seizures, developmental delay, behavioural problems and skin abnormalities, as well as lung and kidney disease. TSC is caused by mutations on either of two genes, TSC1 and TSC2, which encode for the proteins hamartin and tuberin respectively. These proteins act as tumour growth suppressors and regulate cell proliferation and differentiation. Originally regarded as a rare pathological curiosity, it is now an important focus of research into tumour formation and suppression.|$|E
5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate intolerance or a more generalized drug intolerance to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E
5|$|In 2007 the ApHC {{implemented}} {{new drug}} rules allowing Appaloosas to show with the drugs furosemide, {{known by the}} trade name of Lasix, and acetazolamide. Furosemide is used to prevent horses who bleed from the nose when subjected to strenuous work from having bleeding episodes when in competition, and is widely used in horse racing. Acetazolamide ("Acet") is used for treating horses with the <b>genetic</b> <b>disease</b> hyperkalemic periodic paralysis (HYPP), and prevents affected animals from having seizures. Acet is only allowed for horses that test positive for HYPP and have HYPP status noted on their registration papers. The ApHC recommends that Appaloosas that trace to certain American Quarter Horse bloodlines be tested for HYPP, and owners {{have the option to}} choose to place HYPP testing results on registration papers. Foals of AQHA-registered stallions and mares born on or after January 1, 2007 that carry HYPP will be required to be HYPP tested and have their HYPP status designated on their registration papers.|$|E
