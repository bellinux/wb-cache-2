40|$|The <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> risk {{management}} process involves a set of crucial logistical decisions referring to the planning of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> transportation {{and the organization of}} the emergency response operations. The objective {{of this paper is to}} present a Decision Support System for <b>hazardous</b> <b>Materials</b> Transportation Risk Management that covers integrated <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> distribution and emergency response decisions. The inherent interrelationships between the emerging <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> logistical problems imply the integration of routing and emergency response logistical decisions in order to improve the effectiveness of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> emergency response process. The proposed system contributes substantially to this objective by providing the following capabilities: (i) provision of alternative efficient <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> distribution routes in terms of minimum cost and risk, (ii) identification of the emergency response units locations that minimise the incident response time and secure a predefined service level for <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> incidents, (iii) routing of the emergency response units, and (iv) identification of optimum evacuation plans i. e. optimum evacuation paths and traffic assignment given the evacuation area. The focus of this paper is on the exposition of the proposed Decision Support System components and capabilities while special emphasis is placed on the contribution of this system to the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> {{risk management}} process.

The contents of this Subchapter C are called the <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Materials</b> Regulations (HMR). The requirements in the HMR apply to each person who offers a <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> for transportation in commerce, causes a <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> to be transported in commerce, or transports a <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> in commerce and who performs or is responsible for performing a pre-transportation function.

40|$|The {{transportation}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> keeps increasing across the United States {{due to the}} growing consumption of goods and rising need for manufactured materials. Furthermore, concerns are mounting over the safe surface {{transportation of}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials.</b> Highways and rails {{are the most common}} modes of transport for <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> although the risk posed from highway transport of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> may be higher {{due to the fact that}} highways are public while rails are mostly private. The majority of <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> cargo is carried on the highway network by trucks. Due to possible adverse effects on human and animal populations in the event of an accident involving <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> there is a need for the development of a highway route risk assessment tool that precisely represents transportation risks associated with hazardous cargos and to build a framework for designating a set of risky routes based on different factors. The research presented in this thesis explains a methodology to analyze the spatial patterns of truck accident data, discern potentially risky routes of truck traffic carrying <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> and estimate the impact area of an identified risky route by quantifying the human population affected in that area. Lancaster County in Nebraska was used as the study area and the <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> exposure from a theoretical truck-involved accident was estimated. It was concluded that the developed procedures successfully identified vulnerable areas in terms of <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> transport and estimated the affected areas and human population.

40|$|Safe {{transportation}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> in the United States {{is an important}} national issue.

Development of the model included a literature review and administration Of a needs assessment questionnaire. The literature search And responses to the questionnaire confirmed the need for this model And shaped its content and format. The <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> educational model contains five discrete units. Unit 1 presents a general overview of the subject and maybe utilized by itself or in conjunction with any of the supplemental units. The supplemental units are designed to provide more specialized information and may be used to develop programs or workshops of varying lengths and to accommodate varying interests. Unit 2 provides basic general information on toxicology and is included so participants in this program will have an understanding of how exposure to chemicals may produce biological effects. Unit 3 is designed to enhance participants??? knowledge of how <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> emergencies are generally responded to and why they vary from other emergency situations. The intent of Unit 4 is to familiarize participants with the requirements of transportation, storage and disposal of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials.</b> Their overall importance within a <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> management program is also considered. The authority for developing and administering a <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> program is derived from a variety of laws as indicated in Unit 5, <b>Hazardous</b> <b>Material</b> Laws.
