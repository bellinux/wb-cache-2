The film's co-writer Roberto Orci suggested that the IMAX footage would be 3D, but Bay later said that considering himself an [...] "old school" [...] filmmaker, he found 3D gimmicky and added that shooting in IMAX was easier than using stereoscopic cameras. The IMAX version of the film, in the end, contained almost ten minutes of IMAX-filmed footage out of the {{two and a half}} hour film.

40|$|Infrared (IR) camera {{measurements}} were obtained of exhaust plumes exiting from a subsonic nozzle {{designed for a}} nozzle pressure ratio (NPR) of 1. 6. Measurements were obtained with the plume having a NPR of 1. 6, a fixed nozzle inlet temperature (Tin) of 865 K, and a fixed mass flow rate (m &) of 1. 4 kg/s. The plume had a core of high radiation intensity (I) near the nozzle exit which experienced a linear decay in <b>the</b> plume I <b>for</b> nearly all operating conditions. Following the core, the plume I decayed exponentially due to viscous mixing of the plume with the surrounding air. The I from plumes with a NPR of 1. 6 but varying Tin and m & varied greatly in magnitude, but had comparable non-dimensionalized profiles. Plumes with a fixed m & exhibited a temperature (T) dependence of 5. 1 {{which is due to}} the nonlinear dependence of I on Tin as well as the dependence of the plume Tin on the equivalence ratio (Φ). For a fixed m &, non-dimensionalized I profiles were similar regardless of the Tin. <b>The</b> plume I <b>for</b> a fixed Tin had the highest peak intensity (<b>Imax)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> smallest m & and <b>the</b> smallest <b>Imax</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> highest m &. This is attributed to changes in <b>the</b> static T <b>for</b> <b>the</b> different m & due to isentropic expansion through the nozzle.

40|$|Prototoxin {{proteins}} {{have been}} identified as members of the Ly 6 /uPAR super family whose three-finger motif resembles that of α-bungarotoxin. Though they are known to modify the function of nAChRs, their specificity is still unclear. Our lab identified three prototoxin proteins in the chicken ciliary ganglion: Ch 3 ly, Ch 5 ly, and Ch 6 ly. Ch 6 ly was later identified as prostate stem cell antigen (PSCA), and specifically decreased the amount of calcium influx through the homomeric α 7 nAChR subtype. I then identifiedCh 3 ly and Ch 5 ly as LY 6 E and LYPD 6 B, respectively. I focused my attention onLYPD 6 B because of its expression in the brain. This dissertation tests whether LYPD 6 Bis a prototoxin protein that specifically co-localizes with and modifies the function of the heteromeric α 3 β 4 * nAChRs (the other nAChR subtype expressed in the chicken ciliary ganglia). In the first part of my dissertation I performed intracellular two-electrode voltage clamp on Xenopus oocytes co-expressing human LYPD 6 B and different stoichiometries of the α 3 β 4 * nAChR, these included two (α 3) 2 (β 4) 3 withβ 4 −α 3 −β 4 −β 4 −α 3 and β 4 −α 3 −β 4 −α 3 −β 4 stoichiometries, two (α 3) 3 (β 4) 2 with stoichiometries β 4 −α 3 −α 3 −β 4 −α 3 and β 4 −α 3 −β 4 −α 3 −α 3, two (α 3 β 4) 2 (α 5 D) β 4 −α 3 −α 5 D−β 4 −α 3 and β 4 −α 3 −β 4 −α 3 −α 5 D, and (α 3 β 4) 2 (α 5 N) with stoichiometries β 4 −α 3 −α 5 N−β 4 −α 3 and β 4 −α 3 −β 4 −α 3 −α 5 N. Concatemeric constructs are designed to link nAChR subunits, thus when translated it is done so as a single polypeptide. LYPD 6 Bincreased the acetylcholine (ACh) potency and desensitization rate, but decreased the maximum current response (<b>Imax)</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> (α 3) 3 (β 4) 2 nAChR subtype. Yet, LYPD 6 Bonly decreased <b>the</b> <b>Imax</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> (α 3 β 4) 2 α 5 D-variant and not the N-variant (associated with increase nicotine consumption). <b>For</b> <b>the</b> second part of my dissertation, I determined if the expression of LYPD 6 B correlated with nAChRs in an activity dependent manner. Though LYPD 6 B mRNA expression correlates with nAChR subunit mRNA expression levels, it seemed to be independent of nAChR activity. To determine if fluorescent colocalization occurs between LYPD 6 B and a specific nAChR subtype, I genetically engineered LYPD 6 B to express a human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) epitope tag and cloned into a chicken retrovirus. LYPD 6 B was shown to co-localize only with the α 3 β 4 *heteromeric and not the homomeric α 7 nAChRs, in a nAChR activity dependent manner. This study adds to the complexity of a prototoxin’s function by suggesting that the specificity is dependent on nAChR type and stoichiometry. It is the first in identifying a prototoxin protein, LYPD 6 B, which specifically modulates the function of the(α 3) 3 (β 4) 2 and (α 3 β 4) 2 (α 5 D-variant) heteromeric nAChR subtypes. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> (α 3 β 4) 2 (α 5 D-variant) nAChR subtype LYPD 6 B decreased the Imax. Such observation may be telling of a novel mechanism involved with nicotine dependence. For the(α 3) 3 (β 4) 2 nAChR subtype LYPD 6 B increases its ACh sensitivity, desensitization rate, while decreasing Imax. Additionally, the co-localization of LYPD 6 B and α 3 β 4 * nAChRsin the lack of nAChR activity highlights the relevance of the functional effects α 3 β 4 *nAChRs exhibit due to LYPD 6 B. Such relevance may be the utilization of limiting Ach amounts...|$|R
40|$|INTRODUCTION: In {{this study}} we {{investigated}} differences in the spatial recruitment of motor units (MUs) in the quadriceps when electrical stimulation is applied over the quadriceps belly versus the femoral nerve. METHODS: M-waves and mechanical twitches were evoked using over-the-quadriceps and femoral nerve stimulation of gradually increasing intensity from 22 young, healthy subjects. Spatial recruitment was investigated using recruitment curves of M-waves recorded from the vastus medialis (VM) and vastus lateralis (VL) and of twitches recorded from the quadriceps. RESULTS: At maximal stimulation intensity (Imax), {{no differences were found}} between nerve and over-the-quadriceps stimulation. At submaximal intensities, VL M-wave amplitude was higher for over-the-quadriceps stimulation at 40 % Imax, and peak twitch force was greater for nerve stimulation at 60 % and 80 % <b>Imax.</b> CONCLUSIONS: <b>For</b> <b>the</b> VM, MU spatial recruitment during nerve and over-the-quadriceps stimulation of increasing intensity occurred in a similar manner, whereas significant differences were observed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> VL.
