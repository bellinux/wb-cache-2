40|$|Abstract. Parametric instabilities excited in ionospheric heating {{experiments}} are studied. The initial processes excited directly by HF <b>heating</b> (<b>pump)</b> waves include parametric decay instabilities, which decay the HF heating wave to a frequency-downshifted Langmuir/upper hybrid sideband {{together with an}} ion acoustic/lower hybrid wave as the decay mode, and oscillating two stream instabilities, which decay the HF heating wave to two oppositely propagating Langmuir/upper hybrid sidebands and a purely growing mode/field-aligned density irregularities. These instabilities provide effective channels to convert electromagnetic heating waves to electrostatic plasma waves in the F region of the ionosphere. The instability thresholds, growth rates, angular distribution, and regions of excitation are determined. The high frequency sidebands (Langmuir waves and upper hybrid waves) of the initial parametric instabilities can be driven to large amplitudes. These waves then become new pump waves to excite follow-up parametric instabilities, which provide cascade channels to broaden the spectra of plasma waves and generate short-scale density irregularities. The follow-up parametric instabilities include cascades of Langmuir pump waves into Langmuir sidebands and ion acoustic waves, and the filamentation of those hig...|$|E

40|$|The {{emerging}} {{field of}} photoacoustic tomography is rapidly evolving with many new system designs and reconstruction algorithms being published. Many systems use {{water as a}} coupling medium between the scanned object and the ultrasound transducers. Prior to a scan, the water is heated to body temperature to enable small animal imaging. During the scan, the water heating system of some systems is switched off {{to minimize the risk}} of bubble formation, which leads to a gradual decrease in water temperature and hence the speed of sound. In this work, we use a commercially available scanner that follows this procedure, and show that a failure to model intra-scan temperature decreases as small as 1. 5 °C leads to image artifacts that may be difficult to distinguish from true structures, particularly in complex scenes. We then improve image quality by continuously monitoring the water temperature during the scan and applying variable speed of sound corrections in the image reconstruction algorithm. While upgrading to an air bubble-free <b>heating</b> <b>pump</b> and keeping it running during the scan could also solve the changing temperature problem, we show that a software correction for the temperature changes provides a cost-effective alternative to a hardware upgrade. The efficacy of the software corrections was shown to be consistent across objects of widely varying appearances, namely physical phantoms, ex vivo tissue, and in vivo mouse imaging. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to demonstrate the efficacy of modeling temporal variations in the speed of sound during photoacoustic scans, as opposed to spatial variations as focused on by previous studies. Since air bubbles pose a common problem in ultrasonic and photoacoustic imaging systems, our results will be useful to future small animal imaging studies that use scanners with similarly limited heating units...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{essay is}} divided into two parts, the first being a construction of a single-family house and the second an in-depth study of five different isolation materials, analysed from an energy perspective. The first part, the construction of the single-family house, has been created from knowledge acquired during three years of studying at KTH Royal institute of Technology in Stockholm, in the program Architecture and the Built Environment. The constructed house is a one-floor house of 137 m 2 with façade plaster, situated in Borlänge, Sweden. The house has a wooden frame which is built on a on sight cast concrete foundation, on the ground. The house’s roof is a gable roof, which has an angle of 24 degrees. The roofing is tile. The house is heated by underfloor heating connected to a geothermal <b>heating</b> <b>pump</b> and the ventilation is controlled by a FTXsystem. A specific energy requirement was set up so secure that an energy efficient construction was chosen. The reason for the topic of the study (isolation materials), is due to the increase of demands put on the energy economizing and climate aware, both from the building industry and society at large. The purpose was to investigate whether there are better alternatives than the traditional mineral wool isolation, when looking at energy efficiency. The depth study was based on both literatures on the subject and product information. From this a comparison of the five materials was made. The premises considered where: energy efficiency; price i. e. investment costs; energy release from manufacturing the material, and energy consumption during 25 years of a mortar phase. The comparison is divided between energy comparison and a calculation of the costs. The comparison was further divided by first looking at a scenario where the wall structures U-value is constant and a varying isolation thickness; and then the isolation thickness was constant and the U-value was varied. From this conclusions about the suitability of the materials were drawn. Stone wool was the material found most suitable when calculations where finished, and therefore it was chosen to be the isolation in the constructed single-family house...|$|E
40|$|Sweden {{has long}} had access to low {{electricity}} prices due to the wide availability of hydro and nuclear power. This has now changed because of today's rising electricity rates resulting in increasing heating costs for properties, especially in the properties with electric heating systems. "Ankaret" is a parish for "Svenska Alliansmissionen", which is located at "Gullbrannagården". The parish has installed electrical radiators and an exhaust ventilation system that makes the energy demand high due to the large ventilation flows. The building was built {{as the price of}} electricity was still low and would reduce energy use today by combining its heating system with an air/air heat pump. The heat pump delivers more heat into the room than the electrical energy that it uses. This lowers the electricity needs. At present, the Assembly pays 22 000 SEK for electricity, water and sewage. The report's purpose is other than to install a heat pump to improve an air/air heat pump with a very simple solution. Air/air heat pumps have a lower COP-factor in cold out temperatures when the most energy is needed in the building. Suggesting an unusual placement of the heat pump in order to take advantage of an otherwise unused energy source. By placing the heat pump near the exhaust ventilation to use the heat that would otherwise just had been energy losses. In this report a discussion with three options for recovering heat from the ventilation system will take place. The added heat to the heat pump will reduce the temperature difference and thus increase the COP-factor to allow it to supply more heat to "Ankaret". The defrosting of the outer part (the evaporator) performs at cold temperatures due to icing will be lowered which further improves the heat pump. The report will also identify the transmission and ventilation losses for "Ankaret" to assess the energy need. An estimation of household electricity (lighting, appliances, etc.) and hot water use will be carried out in order to obtain an approximate value for how much electrical energy the building use. In addition, there will also be two alternative heating systems which have a similar function as an air/air heat pump that uses heat from a ventilation system. This is a "FTX" ventilation system and an extractor <b>heating</b> <b>pump.</b> This is to see the difference in the investment cost for the three different systems and the energy savings. The result of the energy inventory shows an overall energy use at 37 000 kWh/year of these 5 500 kWh/year household electricity and water heating. The specific energy use for heating is 180 kWh/m 2  and year.

As the cost of energy continues to rise, it becomes imperative to save energy and improve overall energy efficiency.

Improving <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> performance, reliability, and its environmental impact has been an ongoing concern.

40|$|Liquid {{desiccant}} {{air conditioning}} (LDAC) has received much attention in recent years. This is mainly because LDAC systems {{are able to}} control latent loads in a more energy efficient way than conventional air conditioning systems. Although many research {{studies have been conducted}} on LDAC technologies, the following gaps in the scientific literature are addressed in this thesis: (1) carryover of desiccant droplets in air streams, (2) direct comparisons between different configurations of LDAC systems, (3) fundamentals of capacity matching in heat-pump LDAC systems, (4) optimal-control strategies for heat-pump LDAC systems, and (5) importance of transients in evaluating the performance of a LDAC system. Items (1) to (4) are addressed using TRNSYS simulations, and item (5) is addressed using data collected from a field test. The use of liquid-to-air membrane energy exchangers (LAMEEs) as dehumidifiers and regenerators in LDAC systems eliminate the desiccant droplets carryover problem in air streams. This is because LAMEE separate the air and solution streams using semi-permeable membranes, which allow the transfer of heat and moisture but do not allow the transfer of the liquid desiccant. A preliminary configuration for a membrane LDAC system, which uses LAMEEs as the dehumidifier and regenerator, is proposed and investigated under fixed operating conditions in this thesis. The influences of key design and operating parameters on the heat and mass transfer performances of the membrane LDAC system are evaluated. Results show that the membrane LDAC technology is able to effectively remove latent loads in applications that the humidity to be controlled. A comprehensive evaluation is conducted in this thesis for the thermal, economic and environmental performances of several configurations of membrane LDAC systems. The solution cooling load is covered using a cooling heat pump in all systems studied, while the solution heating load is covered using one of the following five different heating systems: (1) a gas boiler, (2) a heating heat pump, (3) a solar thermal system with gas boiler backup, (4) a solar thermal system with heat pump backup, and (5) the condenser of the solution cooling <b>heating</b> <b>pump.</b> Each of the membrane LDAC systems studied is evaluated with/without an energy recovery ventilator (ERV) installed in the air handling system. The influence of operating the ERV under balanced/unbalanced operating conditions is studied. It is found that the most economic membrane LDAC system is the one which uses the evaporator and condenser of the same heat pump to cover the solution cooling and heating loads, respectively (i. e. heat-pump membrane LDAC system). No clear guidance was found in the literature for sizing the evaporator and condenser in a heat-pump LDAC system to simultaneously meet the solution cooling and heating loads. When the heating and cooling provided by the heat pump exactly match the heating and cooling requirements of the solution, the system is “capacity matched”. A parametric study is conducted on a heat-pump membrane LDAC system to identify the influence of key operating and design parameters on achieving capacity matching. It is concluded that the solution inlet temperatures to the dehumidifier and regenerator are the most influential parameters on the moisture removal rate, capacity matching and coefficient of performance (COP). Three control strategies are developed for heat-pump membrane LDAC systems, where these strategies meet the latent loads and achieve one of the following three objectives: (1) meet the sensible loads, (2) achieve capacity matching, or (3) optimize the COP. Results show that the COP of a heat-pump LDAC system can be doubled by selecting the right combination of solution inlet temperatures to the regenerator and dehumidifier. The importance of transients in evaluating the performance of a LDAC system is addressed in the thesis using a data collected from a field test on a solar LDAC system. It is found that the sensible, latent and total cooling energy, and the total primary energy consumption of the LDAC system are changed by less than 10 % during an entire test day when transients are considered. Thus, it can be concluded that steady-state models are reliable to evaluate the energy performances of LDAC systems...|$|E

The housing types considered are a 1980 's house, an energy efficient house and a “net zero ready” house. The advanced <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems considered in the analysis focused on coupling solar energy on the evaporator side of an air source and water source <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> to improve performance compared to a standard air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> and provide an alternative to a costly ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system. The annual energy consumption and utility cost of the solar assisted <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems were compared to a market available air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> a ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system {{as well as the}} typical reference housing heating and cooling system. The results predicted that a solar assisted air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> has a comparable capital cost to a ground source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system in all housing types and the highest energy savings for a “net zero ready” house of 34 % compared to the base case. The solar assisted water source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> did not yield interesting results, as the solar assisted air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> demonstrated improved energy savings and lower capital costs in all housing types considered. Comparing the 20 year life cycle costs of the solar assisted <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> systems to the base case, only in the 1980 's housing archetype did the solar assisted air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> system demonstrate a lower life cycle cost than the base case. A standard air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> yielded the lowest life cycle cost in the 1980 's and energy efficient house considered and the reference base case system had the lowest life cycle cost in the net zero ready house considered...|$|R
40|$|In {{a double}} stage-coupling <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> {{comprising}} an air source and water loop <b>heat</b> <b>pump,</b> the 13 ~ 20 ? low temperature water is supplied {{to the water}} loop <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> unit. The water loop <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> can extract <b>heat</b> from the water and heat the indoor air. The most common method of air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> frost removal is reverse-cycle defrost. During the defrosting operation, the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> runs in the cooling mode. The defrost process is accomplished by reversing the normal heating mode. In this paper, {{the effect of the}} heat storage tank to the air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> defrosting is test. Owing to the existence of the heat storage tank, thermal inertia of the loop is relatively high. The frosting and defrosting course of the air source <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> have little effect on the room temperature...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of thermal resistance {{on the performance}} of a <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> operating with three heat sources is investigated by using an endoreversible cyclic model with continuous flow. The overall heat-transfer area of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is chosen as an objective function for optimization. For a specified COP and rate of <b>heat</b> <b>pumping,</b> the expression for minimum overall heat-transfer area of the <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> is derived. This expression is used (a) to discuss the optimal performance of an endoreversible <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> operating with three heat sources and (b) to deduce the optimal performance of a Carnot <b>heat</b> <b>pump</b> with continuous flow. The results obtained here may be useful for exploitation of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by low-grade heat from the sun, geothermal energy or waste heat and also for improvement of <b>heat</b> <b>pumps</b> driven by high-grade energy sources...|$|R
