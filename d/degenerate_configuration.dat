This is commonly achieved by introducing a prior which, together with the data constraints, determines a unique and hopefully stable solution. Choosing a “correct ” prior is however a well-known obstacle. This paper demonstrates that in a certain class of motion estimation problems, the Bayesian technique of integrating out the “nuisance parameters ” yields stable solutions even if a flat prior on the motion parameters is used. The advantage of the suggested method is more noticeable when the domain points approach a <b>degenerate</b> <b>configuration,</b> and/or when the noise is relatively large {{with respect to the}} size of the point configuration...|$|E

40|$|Abstract In {{estimating}} {{motions of}} multi-centered optical systems using the generalized camera model, {{one can use}} the linear seventeen-point algorithm for obtaining a generalized essential matrix, the counterpart of the eight-point algorithm for the essential matrix {{of a pair of}} cameras. Like the eight-point algorithm, the seventeen-point algorithm has degenerate cases. However, mechanisms of the degeneracy of this algorithm have not been investigated. We propose a method to find degenerate cases of the algorithm by decomposing a measurement matrix that is used in the algorithm into two matrices about ray directions and centers of projections. This decomposition method allows us not only to prove degeneracy of the previously known degenerate cases, but also to find a new <b>degenerate</b> <b>configuration...</b>|$|E

The method do not need stereo correspondence but, nevertheless, can determine absolute scale factor, which is an important factor for long term navigation and SLAM. The method use only motion correspondence basically, which is easier to solve than stereo correspondence because the SFM algorithm can use a sequence of images taken at short time intervals. However, we infer the stereo correspondence inversely from the absolute estimates of structure and motion parameters and utilize this information to improve the performance of our method. Consequently, the method maintain the robustness to the stereo correspondence ambiguity and can avoid the <b>degenerate</b> <b>configuration</b> reported in the former paper. W...|$|E
40|$|In the corner-sharing lattice, {{magnetic}} frustration causes macroscopic degeneracy in {{the ground}} state, which prevents systems from ordering. However, if the ensemble of the <b>degenerate</b> <b>configuration</b> has some global structure, the system can have a symmetry breaking phenomenon and thus posses a finite temperature phase transition. As a typical example of such cases, the magnetic phase transition of the Ising-like Heisenberg antiferromagnetic model on the kagome lattice has been studied. There, a phase transition of the two-dimensional ferromagnetic Ising universality class occurs accompanying with the uniform spontaneous magnetization. Because of the macroscopic degeneracy in the ordered phase, the system is found to show an entropy-driven ordering process, which is quantitatively characterized {{by the number of}} ``weathervane loop''.

40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} estimating the extrinsic parameters (pose) of a camera {{with respect to a}} reference 3 D object without a direct view. Since the camera does not view the object directly, previous approaches have utilized reflections in a planar mirror to solve this problem. However, a planar mirror based approach requires a minimum of three reflections and has <b>degenerate</b> <b>configurations</b> where estimation fails. In this paper, we show that the pose can be obtained using a single reflection in a spherical mirror of known radius. This makes our approach simpler and easier in practice. In addition, unlike planar mirrors, the spherical mirror based approach does not have any <b>degenerate</b> <b>configurations,</b> leading to a robust algorithm. While a planar mirror reflection results in a virtual perspective camera, a spherical mirror reflection results in a nonperspective axial camera. The axial nature of rays allows us to compute the axis (direction of sphere center) and few pose parameters in a linear fashion. We then derive an analytical solution to obtain the distance to the sphere center and remaining pose parameters and show that it corresponds to solving a 16 th degree equation. We present comparisons with state-of-art method using planar mirrors and show that our approach recovers more accurate pose in the presence of noise.

This allows an outlook on how singularity removal might be analyzed in a general setting and also in the full theory. The general mechanism of loop quantum cosmology will be shown to be insensitive to recently observed unbounded behavior of inverse volume in the full theory. Moreover, significant features of this unboundedness are not a consequence of inhomogeneities but of non-Abelian effects which can also be included in homogeneous models. ...|$|R
