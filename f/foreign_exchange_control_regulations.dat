40|$|The paper reviews Japan’s {{experiences}} with the liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> and attempts to identify its policy implications for China, focusing on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> rate regime, capital mobility restrictions, sterilized interventions, and independence of monetary policy. To provide a theoretic foundation, the paper first sets up a simple enlarged Mundell-Fleming model and analyses whether capital account controls and sterilized interventions can maintain managed floating rate regime and independent monetary policy simultaneously. The author argues that it is theoretically possible for a finite time and it is increasingly difficult under circumstances of the expansion in current transactions, and large and persistent capital mobility. Secondly, the paper presents an overview on Japan’s experiences in liberalization of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> from immediate postwar to 1990. Japan adopted gradual steps to liberalize <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls,</b> with the freedom in current account in 1964, the shift of exchange rate from pegged to managed floating in 1971, and finally to freely floating in 1973, and the liberalization of capital account in 1980. Japanese experiences of liberalization on <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> are mixed. Japan’s long resistances to the unavoidable yen revaluation led t...|$|R

40|$|With {{the opening}} up of China, both foreign trade and foreign {{investment}} are assuming greater importance every day. All of these transactions involve {{the use of}} <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange.</b> In China, a system of <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> has been in operation since {{the founding of the}} nation. More recently, {{as a result of a}} growing awareness of the need for formal legislation and proper legal procedures, much of the hitherto unwritten practices regarding <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> have been refined and passed into law. I would like to examine the rationale and the economic implications of these laws. In general, we can see that China badly needs an economic way of managing its <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves. The existing largely administrative way of managing the country’s <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves inevitably leads to economic inefficiency. It also, inevitably, opens up avenues for various “economic crimes”. Although a strong political will at the top to stamp out economic crimes has met with partial success, the cost to the country is huge and cannot be gauged only by looking at the additional administrative costs that go into policing the system. Already, the situation is retarding growth and it could threaten to abort the economic reform of the country. In the first section I will discuss the operation and effects of the present <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>control</b> system. Section II describes China’s policy initiatives in response to the problems that have come to light. I will then discuss an economic way of managing China’s <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> reserves in Section III, and draw some conclusions in Section IV...|$|R

The pound floated in 1989. However, until 2001, the float was tightly managed by the Central Bank of Egypt and <b>foreign</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>controls</b> were in effect.
