25|$|PHRs {{have the}} {{potential}} to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of drug interaction, current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, {{in the case of an}} emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.|$|E
25|$|Objectification theory {{suggests}} both {{direct and indirect}} consequences of objectification to women. Indirect consequences include self consciousness in terms that a woman is consistently checking or rearranging her clothes or appearance to ensure that she is presentable. More direct consequences are related to sexual victimization. Rape and sexual harassment are examples of this. Doob (2012) states that sexual harassment {{is one of the}} challenges faced by women in workplace. This may constitute sexual jokes or comments, most of which are degrading. Research indicates that objectification theory is valuable to understanding how repeated visual images in the media are socialized and translated into mental health problems, including psychological consequences on the individual and societal level. These include increased self-consciousness, increased body anxiety, heightened mental <b>health</b> <b>threats</b> (depression, anorexia nervosa, bulimia, and sexual dysfunction), and increased body shame. Therefore, the theory has been used to explore an array of dependent variables including disordered eating, mental health, depression, motor performance, body image, idealized body type, stereotype formation, sexual perception and sexual typing. Body shame is a byproduct of the concept of an idealized body type adopted by most Western cultures that depicts a thin, model-type figure. Thus, women will engage in actions meant to change their body such as dieting, exercise, eating disorders, cosmetic surgery, etc. Effects of objectification theory are identified on both the individual and societal levels.|$|E

500|$|Normal {{functioning}} of the kidney, brain, liver, heart, and other systems can be affected by uranium exposure, because, besides being weakly radioactive, uranium is a toxic metal. Uranium is also a reproductive toxicant. Radiological effects are generally local because alpha radiation, the primary form of 238U decay, has a very short range, and will not penetrate skin. Alpha radiation from inhaled uranium has been demonstrated to cause lung cancer in exposed nuclear workers.

The Emory University Global Health Institute, funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, partners with the CDC to enhance public health infrastructure in low-resource countries.

40|$|Background: Studies {{have shown}} that the psychosocial {{determinants}} attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and <b>health</b> <b>threat</b> are important in predicting intention to change fat consumption. However, the role of habit in relation to these determinants is still largely unknown. Objective: We aimed to assess whether and how habit influences intention in relation to attitude, self-efficacy, subjective norm, and <b>health</b> <b>threat.</b> Design: Cross-sectionally, we studied the self-reported psychosocial determinants and intention of 105 (52 intervention, 53 control) patients who participated in a family practice-based tailored nutrition counseling intervention study for lowering cardiovascular risk. Fat intake 15 mo before the assessment of psychosocial determinants was used as a measure of habit. We used logistic regression analyses to develop a model predicting intention to change fat consumption. Results: Our regression model explained 43 % of the variance in intention. Patients who perceived higher subjective norm or more social support had a higher intention. Habit {{was a significant predictor of}} intention in interaction with self-efficacy and <b>health</b> <b>threat.</b> Attitude, <b>health</b> <b>threat,</b> age, and group membership (ie, whether patients had been in the intervention group or the control group of the intervention study) were also included in the regression model. Conclusions: The results suggest that habit in addition to subjective norm and the other more frequently investigated psychosocial determinants are important in predicting intention to change fat consumption. To achieve sustainable health improvement through nutrition education programs, these programs should therefore start focusing more on subjective norm and habit...|$|R
