The study targeted parents, guardians, and caregivers at the Speech, Language, and Hearing Clinic at California State University, Fresno. A diverse population of participants between the ages of 26 and 85 provided usable data. Participants completed the Adult Carer Quality of Life (AC-QoL) Questionnaire, which was analyzed using the Chi-Squared <b>Fisher</b> <b>s</b> Exact Test. Significance was set at the 0. 05 level. Results from the <b>Fisher</b> <b>s</b> Exact Test failed to reject the null hypotheses, and no significant differences were found in caregiver quality of life based upon the variables age, gender, ethnicity, and the number of hours spent caring...|$|R

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} in unlimited. The thesis studies the Israel Defense Forces' (IDF) {{transformation in the}} context of the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation.</b> The thesis argues that the uniqueness of the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> does not prevent other militaries from applying the relevant concepts and considers the IDF as a good candidate for such a demonstration. Therefore, the thesis explores the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> as a model to be benefited in the IDF's continuing transformation. The thesis also studies IDF from many perspectives to identify the transformational imperatives and the relevance of the current IDF transformational efforts. Main areas of interest are the Israeli security environment, societal transformation, and the features of the IDF's transformational efforts. During the analysis, the thesis discovers weak points concerning, both, the U. <b>S.</b> military <b>transformation</b> and the IDF's current organization. The examination of the IDF's transformation in relation to the U. <b>S.</b> <b>transformation</b> reveals similarities between the two transformations and comes up with recommendations, primarily for the IDF, but to a lesser extent for the U. S. military. First Lieutenant, Turkish Arm...|$|R

40|$|In this paper, {{a robust}} image {{watermarking}} method with S-Hough transformation is proposed which is robust against geometric distortion. This watermarking is detected by a linear frequency change. The chirp signals {{are used as}} watermarks and this type of signals is resistant to all stationary filtering methods and exhibits geometrical symmetry. In the two-dimensional Radon-Wigner transformation domain, the chirp signals used as watermarks change only its position in space/spatial-frequency distribution, after applying linear geometrical attack. But the two-dimensional Radon-Wigner transformation needs too much difficult computing. We propose a modified Hough transformation to provide improved energy concentration of the S-transform. The proposed scheme can resolve the time-frequency localization {{in a better way}} than the standard <b>S</b> <b>transformation.</b> The watermark is embedded in the 1 D improved <b>S</b> <b>transformation</b> domains. The watermark thus generated is invisible and performs well in test and is robust to geometrical attacks. Compared with other watermarking algorithms, this algorithm is more robust, especially against geometric distortion, while having excellent frequency propertie...|$|R
