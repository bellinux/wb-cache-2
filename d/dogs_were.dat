All of these were used as food animals; <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> additionally used for hunting. It is possible that deer were also penned and fattened.|$|E

European visitors noticed the native women, especially those who lost their own children, would often breastfeed puppies and small pigs.|$|E

At various times during the breed's existence, it has been considered a white offshoot of both the Scottish Terrier and the Cairn Terrier breeds.|$|E

5|$|Beagles {{were in the}} United States by the 1840s at the latest, but {{the first}} <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> {{imported}} strictly for hunting and were of variable quality. Since Honeywood had only started breeding in the 1830s, it is unlikely these <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> representative of the modern breed and the description of them as looking like straight-legged Dachshunds with weak heads has {{little resemblance to the}} standard. Serious attempts at establishing a quality bloodline began in the early 1870s when General Richard Rowett from Illinois imported some dogs from England and began breeding. Rowett's Beagles are believed to have formed the models for the first American standard, drawn up by Rowett, L. H. Twadell, and Norman Ellmore in 1887. The beagle was accepted as a breed by the American Kennel Club (AKC) in 1885. In the 20th century the breed has spread worldwide.|$|E

He noted that <b>dogs</b> <b>were</b> a common gift and thought that the earlier voyage of Captain Saris introduced a Japanese type of spaniel into England.|$|E
