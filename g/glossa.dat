5|$|Both {{types of}} Bede's {{theological}} works circulated widely in the Middle Ages. A {{number of his}} biblical commentaries were incorporated into the <b>Glossa</b> Ordinaria, an 11th-century collection of biblical commentaries.

5|$|Robert's Sententiae, or Summa Theologica, {{was well}} known in his time, and has been {{considered}} a key connection in theology between Robert's own teachers' works and the works of Peter Lombard. Robert is the first commentator on St Paul to say that resistance to a tyrant might be vindicated by the Bible. Robert also opined that a king might be excommunicated if royal actions harmed the church. Robert used Gratian's works as sources for his own, citing the Decretum Gratiani. Although he used this work, which dealt with church law, he {{does not appear to}} have been considered a lawyer, and his training was that of a theologian. Furthermore, his years as a student predated the establishment of canon law as a distinct discipline in the European schools. Robert's views of the glossators, and their main work <b>Glossa</b> Ordinaria was that they had shortened their glosses to such a point that they made them unintelligible. Robert was also known as a logician, and John of Salisbury named him one of the leading disputatores, or a person who used rhetoric and logic to debate in public.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to {{most other}} bee species {{which have a}} short {{proboscis}} to consume nectar with a lapping motion of their hair-covered tongues, the long-tongued Euglossini bees utilize a purely suction feeding method to ingest nectar from deep flowers, such as flowering orchid plants. However, because of the dilemma the euglossine bees face—in which energy content rises linearly with nectar sugar concentration, whereas viscosity rises exponentially—, E. imperialis collect more dilute nectars, relative to their lapping bee counterparts, with sucrose concentrations between approximately 30 to 40%. During the actual ingestion, the <b>glossa</b> of E. imperialis is generally fully extended and stationary, stretching 6mm beyond the apical end of the feeding tube formed by the galeae and the labial palps. Therefore, the shift in capillary-based lapping to suction feeding for E. imperialis, although decreasing nectar sugar concentration, maximizes the rate of energy intake for each individual bee.|$|E
500|$|Each homily {{begins with}} a {{paraphrase}} of a Gospel reading (important when the laity did not understand Latin), followed by exegesis (Bennett and Smithers 1982, pp.174–75). The theological content is derivative; Orm closely follows Bede's exegesis of Luke, the Enarrationes in Matthoei, and the <b>Glossa</b> Ordinaria of the Bible. Thus, he reads each verse primarily allegorically rather than literally (Jack, George, in Matthew and Harrison 2004, pp.936–37). Rather than identify individual sources, Orm refers frequently to [...] "" [...] and to the [...] "holy book" [...] (Bennett 1986, p.31). Bennett has speculated that the Acts of the Apostles, <b>Glossa</b> Ordinaria, and Bede were bound together in a large Vulgate Bible in the abbey so that Orm truly was getting all of his material from a source that was, to him, a single book. (Bennett 1986, p.31).|$|E
40|$|Identifying {{the rules}} and {{mechanisms}} that determine the composition and diversity of naturally co-occurring species assemblages is a central topic in community ecology. Although micro-organisms rep- resent the ‘unseen majority’ of species, individuals and biomass in many ecosystems and play pivotal roles in community development and function, {{the study of the}} factors influencing the assembly of microbial communities has lagged behind that of plant and animal communities. In this paper, we investigate exper- imentally the mechanisms accounting for the low species richness of yeast communities inhabiting the nectar of the bumble-bee-pollinated Helleborus foetidus (Ranunculaceae), and explore the relationships between community assembly rules and phylogenetic relatedness. By comparing yeast communities on the <b>glossae</b> of foraging bumble-bees (the potential species pool) with those eventually establishing in virgin nectar probed with bee <b>glossae</b> (the realized community), we address the questions: (i) does nectar filter yeast inocula, so that the communities eventually established there are not random subsamples of species on bumble-bee <b>glossae?</b> and (ii) do yeast communities establishing in H. foetidus nectar exhibit some phylogenetic bias relative to the species pool on bumble-bee <b>glossae?</b> Results show that nectar filtering leads to species-poor, phylogenetically clustered yeast communities that are a predict- able subset of pollinator-borne inocula. Such strong habitat filtering is probably due to H. foetidus nectar representing a harsh environment for most yeasts, where only a few phylogenetically related nectar specialists physiologically endowed to tolerate a combination of high osmotic pressure and fungicidal compounds are able to develop.

40|$|Recent {{studies have}} shown that dense yeast populations often {{occurring}} in flo- ral nectar are numerically dominated by a few species from the flower–insect interface specialized genus Metschnikowia, while generalist yeast species com- monly occurring on leaf surfaces, soil, freshwater, and air were rarely isolated from nectar samples. This study was designed to understand the main factors responsible for the assembly of nectar yeast communities, by combining field experiments with laboratory tests characterizing the physiological abilities of all yeast species forming the pool of potential colonizers for two Spanish flowering plants (Digitalis obscura and Atropa baetica). Yeast frequency and species rich- ness were assessed in external sources (bee <b>glossae,</b> air, plant phylloplane) as well as in pollinator rewards (pollen, nectar). Yeasts were most frequent in external sources (air, flower-visiting insects), less so in the proximate floral environment (phylloplane), and least in pollen and nectar. Nectar communities appeared to be considerably impoverished versions of those in insect <b>glossae</b> and phylloplane. Nectar, pollen, and insect yeast assemblages differed in physi- ological characteristics from those in other substrates. Nectarivorous Metschnik- owia were not more resistant than other yeast species to plant secondary compounds and high sugar concentrations typical of nectar, but their higher growth rates may be decisive for their dominance in ephemeral nectar commu- nities.
