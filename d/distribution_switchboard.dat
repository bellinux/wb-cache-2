40|$|Mobile {{applications}} for <b>distribution</b> <b>switchboard</b> design are very rare. Currently, existing {{program is a}} program on a PC {{that can be used}} to perform complex electrical switchboard design but is not considered practical. An Android application is proposed to be used design a <b>distribution</b> <b>switchboard</b> in a practical way. The application is designed for 10. 1 &# 65533; tablet platform with API 16 android operating system. This application was developed by using &# 65533;Eclipse&# 65533; software. <b>Distribution</b> <b>switchboard</b> designed follows the standard PUIL, SPLN, IEC, and IEEE. <b>Distribution</b> <b>switchboard</b> that has been designed by this application can be compared to the result of &# 65533;MyEcodial L 3. 4 &# 65533; software...|$|E

Then is been described a technological system for connection and control problem of electrical machine. Then is described a drawing documentation includes disposal whole object, electrical machine connection into the switchboard, control boxes and control system. The next part contains a power circuit <b>distribution</b> from <b>switchboard</b> to all facilities including control system. The power circuit {{is shown in}} drawing documentation by the single-line diagram and the line scheme for control circuit. The technological equipments <b>distribution</b> includes main <b>switchboard</b> with cable trays are shown in disposition.
