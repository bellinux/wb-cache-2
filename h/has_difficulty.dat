5|$|The {{extent to}} which cryovolcanism really occurs is a subject of some debate, as water, being denser than ice by about 8%, <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> erupting under normal circumstances. At Enceladus, it appears that cryovolcanism occurs because water-filled cracks are {{periodically}} exposed to vacuum, the cracks being opened and closed by tidal stresses.|$|E

Lexie had an idealistic family life and often <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> understanding her much darker sister, {{who does not have}} the same positive associations with family as Lexie.|$|E
5|$|Hamlet's soliloquies {{have also}} {{captured}} the attention of scholars. Hamlet interrupts himself, vocalising either disgust or agreement with himself, and embellishing his own words.

Upon partaking of their alcohol, Winkle falls into a slumber for twenty years. He returns home and <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> proving his identity and must save his property from an unlawful accusation by his rival. After he proves his identity, he is reunited with his family. The title character was played by Frank H. Crane, but the production credits are largely unknown. The film was released on December 6, 1910, and met with positive reviews. The film is presumed lost.|$|E
5|$|School Rumble is {{a romantic}} shōnen comedy {{revolving}} around {{the daily lives}} of the students of Class 2-C at the fictional Yagami High School, along with their friends and families.

Tenma struggles to confess her feelings to Karasuma. He remains oblivious to her interest, instead seeking fulfillment by indulging in curry. The main male protagonist, delinquent Kenji Harima, similarly yearns for Tenma, attending school solely to be near her. Like Tenma, Harima <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> declaring his love, and whenever he summons the courage to do so, circumstances conspire against him.|$|E
5|$|The low oxygen level {{leads to}} {{physiologic}} constriction of the pulmonary arteries to correct ventilation-perfusion mismatching, which puts excessive {{strain on the}} right side of the heart. When this leads to right sided heart failure, it is known as cor pulmonale. Symptoms of this disorder occur because the heart <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> pumping blood from the body through the lungs. Fluid may, therefore, accumulate in the skin of the legs in the form of edema (swelling), and in the abdominal cavity in the form of ascites; decreased exercise tolerance and exertional chest pain may occur. On physical examination, characteristic findings are the presence of a raised jugular venous pressure, a palpable parasternal heave, a heart murmur due to blood leaking through the tricuspid valve, hepatomegaly (an enlarged liver), ascites and leg edema. Cor pulmonale occurs in about a third of all people with OHS.|$|E

5|$|Alcoholism, {{also known}} as alcohol use {{disorder}} (AUD), is a broad term for any drinking of alcohol that results in mental or physical health problems. It was previously divided into two types: alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence. In a medical context, alcoholism is said to exist when {{two or more of}} the following conditions is present: a person drinks large amounts over a long time period, <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> cutting down, acquiring and drinking alcohol takes up a great deal of time, alcohol is strongly desired, usage results in not fulfilling responsibilities, usage results in social problems, usage results in health problems, usage results in risky situations, withdrawal occurs when stopping, and alcohol tolerance has occurred with use. Risky situations include drinking and driving or having unsafe sex among others. Alcohol use can affect all parts of the body but particularly affects the brain, heart, liver, pancreas, and immune system. This can result in mental illness, Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome, an irregular heart beat, liver failure, and an increase in the risk of cancer, among other diseases. Drinking during pregnancy can cause damage to the baby resulting in fetal alcohol spectrum disorders. Generally women are more sensitive to alcohol's harmful physical and mental effects than men.|$|E
5|$|Hemingway's stories {{typically}} position {{nature as}} a source of refuge and rebirth. His characters are often shown retreating to the country in search of regeneration. Nature acts as the setting for hunters' or fishermen's existential moment of transcendence—especially at the moment when prey is killed. In Big Two-Hearted River, Nick walks away from a ruined town, and enters the woods to hike toward the river, unharmed by the fire. His journey is motivated by absolution; the river is described as two-hearted because it gives life in the form of food (fish) and offers redemption. In the woods, Nick stops in a grove of trees that is described as chapel-like, a description that echoes Stephen Crane's The Red Badge of Courage in which Henry Fleming flees to a chapel-like grove of trees. In the grove Nick sleeps well {{for the first time since}} the war, and there he begins the healing process. The next morning he goes to the river, wading into the water to fish. At first the strength of the current frightens him, and for some moments he <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> controlling himself.|$|E

5|$|The story opens {{when the}} Providers, the {{invisible}} and unidentified rulers {{of all the}} Zones, order Al•Ith, queen of the peaceful paradise of Zone Three, to marry Ben Ata, king of the militarised and repressive Zone Four. Al•Ith is repulsed {{by the idea of}} consorting with a barbarian, and Ben Ata does not want a righteous queen disturbing his military campaigns. Nevertheless, Al•Ith descends to Zone Four and they reluctantly marry. Ben Ata is not used to the company of women he cannot control, and Al•Ith <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> relating to this ill-bred man, but in time they grow accustomed to each other and gain new insights into each other's Zones. Al•Ith is appalled that all of Zone Four's wealth goes into its huge armies, leaving the rest of its population poor and underdeveloped; Ben Ata is astounded that Zone Three has no army at all.|$|E
5|$|When Bart is sent by {{his captors}} into town {{to buy a}} case of antifreeze, he sees a gendarme and tries to ask for help, but the gendarme does not {{understand}} English and only gives Bart a piece of candy. Bart walks away, despairing over his own stupidity, then suddenly begins speaking French to himself. Realizing he has become fluent in the language, he runs back to the gendarme and tells him about the winemakers, who are swiftly arrested and Bart finishes his stay in France being hailed as a hero. He is awarded a medal for his bravery and he is kissed by a French beauty queen. Back in Springfield, Adil is caught by the FBI, forcing him to be deported back to Albania {{in exchange for their}} own child spy. Bart returns to his family, bringing them gifts from France. Back at home trying out the gifts, Homer <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> opening a wine bottle, but is pleased to hear Bart speak French, oblivious that Bart has just called him a buffoon.|$|E
5|$|Difficulty delaying {{gratification}} {{also plays}} a role in internalizing disorders like anxiety and depression. A hallmark behavior in anxiety is avoidance of feared or anxiety-provoking situations. By seeking the immediate relief that comes with avoidance, a person is succumbing to the pull of instant gratification over the larger reward from overcoming the fear and anxiety that caused the avoidance. Procrastination, which is often a reflection of anxiety, is a clear example: a person avoids a dreaded task by engaging in a more enjoyable immediate activity instead. Obsessive–compulsive disorder (OCD) is a more jarring case of this anxiety-related struggle to delay gratification; someone with OCD is unable to resist compulsions that temporarily mitigate the torture of obsessive thoughts, even though these compulsions do not banish the obsessions in the long run. One experiment, however, did not find any significant differences between samples with OCD and healthy controls in delayed gratification, while finding substantially improved delayed gratification among those with obsessive–compulsive personality disorder. Depression is also associated with lower capacity to delay gratification, though the direction of cause and effect is not clear. A depressed person who <b>has</b> <b>difficulty</b> pushing him or herself to engage in previously enjoyed activities is (deliberately or not) prioritizing short-term comfort and is demonstrating an impaired ability to delay gratification. There is evidence that individuals who engage in deliberate self-harm (i.e., cut themselves) are less able to tolerate emotional distress but are more able to tolerate physical pain. Thus it is argued that they injure themselves because they cannot delay gratification and need a way to end emotional pain quickly.|$|E
