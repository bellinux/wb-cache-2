40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the role of}} religious denomination for human capital formation. We employ a unique data set which covers, inter alia, information on numerous measures of school inputs in 169 Swiss districts for the years 1871 / 72, 1881 / 82 and 1894 / 95, marks from pedagogical examinations of conscripts (1875 - 1903), and results from political referenda to capture conservative or progressive values {{in addition to the}} cultural characteristics language and religion. Catholic districts show on average significantly lower educational performance than Protestant districts. However, accounting for other sociocultural characteristics qualifies the role of religion for educational production. The evidence suggests that Catholicism is harmful only in a conservative milieu. We also exploit information on absenteeism of pupils from school to separate provision of schooling from use of schooling. culture, educational production, plural identity, religious <b>denomination,</b> <b>school</b> inputs...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempted}} {{to address the}} questions being raised regarding school-based financing of education in Newfoundland and Labrador. Since activities and amounts of funds raised are generally perceived {{to be on the}} increase, people are beginning to question the economics, ethics, safety, and accountability of school fund-raising. [...] Various aspects of this issue were examined: policy guidelines, activities and degree of funding, distribution of funds raised, the educational value of activities, the attitudes of all parties involved in school-based finance, and the organization and accounting of school fund-raising. Emerging trends were identified, as well as comparisons {{made on the basis of}} religious <b>denomination,</b> <b>school</b> type, and community size. [...] The questionnaire for this study was distributed to 150 principals. Frequency distributions and percentages were determined from those questionnaires returned, while One-way Analysis of Variance tested for significant differences among the three criterion groupings. Interviews were conducted to confirm or refute the statistical findings. In addition, document analysis determined the extent of policy development. [...] Findings revealed limited development of policy guidelines, and inconsistent application of guidelines at the local school level. Hundreds of activities were used to raise funds-most variations of sales, services, or sponsorships. These activities raised $ 5. 8 million in 1988 - 89, or 55. 5 per cent of the total school budgets made available to the province's principals. These funds were expended on student transportation, graduation exercises, school supplies, and athletics. The need for program support continues to Increase. [...] Support for school-based finance is generally good from all parties, but especially from students, teachers, and parents. Despite such activity, it was found that a wide variation exists among schools in terms of organization and accounting procedures. [...] Few significant differences were recorded among the criterion groupings. Only fund-raising totals and board allocations showed a significant difference based on community size. [...] Interviews confirmed the sense of frustration felt by all parties involved over the degree to which fund-raising has grown. In addition, document analysis confirmed the lack of policy direction being shown by the provincial government, related professional organizations, school boards, and individual schools. [...] It was recommended that the Government of Newfoundland and Labrador promote adequacy and equity in educational funding through the adoption of a true foundation plan approach; that school boards begin immediately to develop written policies regarding school-based finance; and that a study be conducted to investigate directly the attitudes of various publics towards school fund-raising...|$|E

5000|$|Apostasy in Islam {{includes}} {{within its}} scope {{not only the}} wilful renunciation of Islam by a Muslim through a declaration of renunciation of the Islamic faith (whether for another religion or irreligiosity), or (in {{the absence of a}} declaration) by specific deed of undergoing the rites of conversion into another religion, but also even denying, or merely questioning, any [...] "fundamental tenet or creed" [...] of Islam, such as the divinity of God, prophethood of Muhammad, or mocking God, or worshipping one or more idols. Different Muslim <b>denominations</b> and <b>schools</b> of thought may hold different additional views of what each considers a fundamental tenet of the faith. Nevertheless, Muslim jurists from the early period, from different Muslim <b>denominations</b> and <b>schools</b> of thought, developed legal institutions to circumvent harsh punishment in cases of allegations or charges of apostasy. These institutions set the standard for what counts as apostasy from Islam so high that at least prior to the 11th century practically no judgment of apostasy could be passed. Subsequently, authorities in the Muslim World have not consistently applied these high standards of what counts for apostasy.|$|R

5000|$|Coal was {{typically}} mined in remote areas, often mountainous. The miners lived in crude housing provided at low cost by the companies, and shopped in company stores. There were few amenities, and few alternative industries besides the railroads and saloons. The anthracite mines of Pennsylvania were owned by large railroads, and managed by bureaucrats. Scranton {{was at the}} center. [...] Bituminous mines were locally owned. The social system revolved {{not so much on}} occupation (nearly all inhabitants were blue collar workers with similar incomes) but on ethnicity. Welsh and English miners had the highest prestige and the best jobs, followed by the Irish. At a lower status stood recent immigrants from Italy and Eastern Europe; recent arrivals from the Appalachian hills were lower status. The ethnic groups would stick together, seldom mingling. Blacks were sometimes brought in as strike breakers. There was little machinery apart from the railroad. Before mechanization began about 1910 the miners relied on brute force, pick-axe, hand drills and dynamite to smash lumps of coal out of the wall, and shovel them into mule-drawn carts that hauled it to the weighing station, and the railroad cars. The culture was heavily masculine, with strength, virility, and physical courage held in high regard. Boxing was the favored sport. Opportunities for women were strictly limited, until textile companies after 1900 started opening small factories in the larger coal towns to employ women. Religion was in high regard, as each group was fiercely loyal to its <b>denomination.</b> <b>Schooling</b> was limited. The aspiration of the boys was to get a job helping around the mines until they were old enough to work underground as [...] "real" [...] miners.|$|R
