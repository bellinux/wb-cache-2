25|$|With {{his arms}} crossed and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> lowered as he skates {{from right to}} left, Grant dominates the canvas. The {{dramatic}} impression is enhanced by a low point of view, much in the fashion of Baroque portraiture in the Grand Manner. But for his folded arms, Grant's pose derives from the Apollo Belvedere, a cast of which was present in West's studio. The black tones of a full-skirted coat, elegant smallclothes and shoes are relieved by a white cravat and cuff, a gray fur lapel, a glimpse of tan glove, and silver buckles on the hat, breeches, and shoes; the stylishly tilted hat belonged to the artist. Behind Grant is a winter landscape of restrained tones composed of distant skaters, trees, and a far-off London skyline that includes Westminster Abbey. Grant's figure divides the canvas into contrasting halves: to the right the coat's silhouette undulates gently, and a large bare tree anchors the composition, while the left side, opening onto the gestures of skaters in motion, is activated by {{the shape of his}} protruding elbow and the jagged contour of coat. Beyond the large tree the recession of the distant treeline creates a movement from right to left which is echoed by the disposition of the secondary figures. The overall handling evidences a lightness of touch and a success in integrating figure and landscape that suggests the open-air portraits of Thomas Gainsborough.|$|E
500|$|MacLaren's {{obituary}} in The Times {{stated that}} he was [...] "one of the outstanding opening batsmen of all time". As a batsman, he {{had a reputation for}} stylishness, but his technique was based on scoring runs safely. He always tried to seize the initiative in a game. Batting with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> raised, he drew his bat back unusually far, which provided the power to his shots, and in particular his drives. He scored runs quickly, mainly through his ability to score from good length balls. When playing a shot, he either stepped right forward or moved far back in the batting crease and having hit the ball, he followed through with the bat, often holding his pose for effect. These qualities, and his quick footwork, made him effective on difficult batting pitches. One of his most highly regarded shots was the hook. In later years, Cardus described the shot: [...] "To see MacLaren hook a fast ball... from the front of his face, was in those days an experience which thrilled me like heroic poetry; he didn't merely hook the ball, he dismissed it from his presence." [...] Cardus, for whom MacLaren was a boyhood hero, wrote prolifically about him in later years; he called one such essay on MacLaren [...] "The Noblest Roman", and judged him among the best of all batsmen. Gideon Haigh suggests: [...] "If ever a cricketer was the creation of a single writer, it is MacLaren, the luminous majesty with which he is associated owed in very large degree to his youthful acolyte Neville Cardus." [...] MacLaren was also a highly proficient fielder, initially in the outfield but later at slip.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Sabin {{inclined}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{towards the}} smoking-room.|$|E
5000|$|... #Caption: Penn Museum, <b>his</b> <b>head</b> turning <b>slightly</b> to <b>his</b> right ...|$|R
60|$|His {{face was}} {{suddenly}} immovable. He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly.</b>|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin had {{the air of}} a man gravely surprised. He shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly.</b>|$|R
60|$|The Colonel bowed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> {{but he did}} not sit down.|$|E
60|$|The boy moved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> {{but made}} no attempt to rise.|$|E
60|$|Aaron {{looked back}} at him with heavy eyes, and shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Hist!" [...] said he, turning <b>his</b> <b>head</b> aside <b>slightly,</b> in a {{listening}} attitude, {{while his}} comrades suddenly ceased their noisy laugh.|$|R
60|$|He shook <b>his</b> <b>head,</b> smiling <b>slightly.</b> But {{he wished}} her to play. She sat and played one of Kishwégin's pieces. He listened, faintly smiling.|$|R
60|$|At half-past eleven {{her husband}} came. His cheeks were very red and very shiny above his black moustache. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> nodded <b>slightly.</b> He {{was pleased with}} himself.|$|R
60|$|Viola coughed, {{turning his}} face {{away from the}} dust, and shaking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
60|$|Mr. Grooten {{inclined}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> He made no remark. Allan {{turned to}} me.|$|E
60|$|Councillor Mikulin {{raised a}} hasty deprecatory hand and {{inclined}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> over his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Pickwick bent <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly,</b> {{in answer}} to these salutations, and, seeing Fogg pull a bundle of papers from his coat pocket, rose {{and walked to the}} window.|$|R
60|$|Then he lazily {{opened his}} eyes, and turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ever so <b>slightly.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Deringham moved <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly.</b> [...] "I {{scarcely}} {{think we}} need go into that, but it is incontrovertible {{that the loss of}} Carnaby would make a difference to her," [...] he said.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Sabin bowed <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> But of {{expression}} {{there was in}} his face no sign.|$|E
60|$|The {{turning of}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> toward {{me at this}} point was like a sign of strong feeling in any other man.|$|E
60|$|Here {{he turned}} <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{and gave a}} brief order to the negress in waiting, who retired by the door behind her.|$|E
60|$|She came {{straight}} {{back to him}} and took both his wrists in her small hands. She was taller than he, and <b>his</b> <b>head</b> was <b>slightly</b> bent forward. Thus she towered over him, loving but strong, her great, earnest eyes searching his soul.|$|R
60|$|The horse-trader, his deep, {{embroidered}} Bokhariot belt unloosed, {{was lying}} {{on a pair of}} silk carpet saddle-bags, pulling lazily at an immense silver hookah. He turned <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly</b> at the cry; and seeing only the tall silent figure, chuckled in his deep chest.|$|R
60|$|She {{had ordered}} him {{to sit on a}} pile of {{cushions}} which lay not far from her chair. Thus was he almost at her feet, and she could look down upon his massive shoulders and on <b>his</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>slightly</b> forward as he spoke.|$|R
60|$|The big lawyer {{listened to}} this {{somewhat}} fervent defence of his order with an amused smile, nodding <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{from side to}} side.|$|E
60|$|She glanced {{towards the}} doctor. He nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> Then {{she went up}} {{to her husband and}} laid her hand upon his shoulders.|$|E
60|$|Cole gasped, swaying {{back and}} forth. Sherikov caught hold of him. Cole gazed {{down into the}} globe, moving <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> {{focussing}} the glasses.|$|E
6000|$|... "Lady Laura, I couldn't {{accept such}} a favour from your father." [...] Then Mr. Kennedy nodded <b>his</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly</b> and whispered, [...] "Yes, yes." [...] "I couldn't think of it," [...] said Phineas Finn. [...] "I {{have no right}} to such a favour." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>His</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>slightly</b> to the right, the heavily-muscled but {{athletic}} {{figure of}} the Doryphoros is depicted standing in the instant that he steps forward from a static pose. This posture reflects only the slightest incipient movement, and yet the limbs and torso are shown as fully responsive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hum!" [...] said Feversham, and he {{loosened}} {{and removed}} the scarf from <b>his</b> <b>head.</b> He shrugged <b>slightly</b> and looked at Wentworth. [...] "Finissons!" [...] said he.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{like you}} best in that dress," [...] he said, {{standing}} with <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> on one side, and appreciating {{her in a}} perceiving, critical fashion.|$|E
60|$|Then Wang heard, {{much more}} faint, a voice {{he had never}} heard before--a novel {{impression}} which he acknowledged by cocking <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> to one side.|$|E
6000|$|Then, as the {{prisoner}} made no reply, but only raised <b>his</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> and looked {{on the other}} two men with dulled, wearied eyes, Chauvelin interposed calmly: ...|$|E
5000|$|Santera (Antera): 161.8 cm, {{is leaning}} on a trident {{with his right}} arm. <b>His</b> <b>head</b> is <b>slightly</b> turned {{to the left and}} his left hand rests on his waist. There is a [...] (shigami) {{ornament}} of a biting lion on his shoulder armour. The posture {{is similar to that of}} Indara.|$|R
6000|$|... "Uncle Trevor, {{we wanted}} to tell you," [...] Cassandra replied for him. [...] "We waited--" [...] she looked appealingly at Rodney, who shook <b>his</b> <b>head</b> ever so <b>slightly.</b>|$|R
50|$|Geometric {{analysis}} of the composition demonstrates its relatively rigid symmetry, with several highlights aligned very close to a vertical axis {{down the middle of}} the painting. However, the work is not completely symmetrical; <b>his</b> <b>head</b> is <b>slightly</b> right of centre, his hair not quite in the middle——the strands of hair fall differently on either side while his eyes look slightly to the left.|$|R
