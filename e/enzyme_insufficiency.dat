40|$|Serum immunoreactive {{cationic}} trypsinogen {{levels were}} determined in 99 control subjects and 381 cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. To evaluate {{the status of}} the exocrine pancreas all CF patients had previously undergone fecal fat balance studies and/or pancreatic stimulation tests. Three hundred fourteen CF patients had fat malabsorption and/or had inadequate pancreatic <b>enzyme</b> secretion (pancreatic <b>insufficiency)</b> requiring oral pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Sixty-seven CF patients did not have fat malabsorption and/or had adequate enzyme secretion (pancreatic sufficiency) and were not receiving pancreatic enzyme supplements with meals. Mean serum trypsinogen in 99 control subjects was 31. 4 ± 14. 8 /µg/hter (± 2 SD) and levels did not vary with age or sex. In CF infants (< 2 yr) with pancreatic insufficiency, mean serum trypsinogen was significantly above the non-CF values (p < 0. 001). Ninety-one percent of the CF infants had elevated levels. Serum trypsinogen values in the pancreatic insuffi ient group declined steeply up to 5 years, reaching subnormal values by age 6. An equation was developed which described these age-related changes very accurately. Only six CF patients with pancreatic insufficiency had serum trypsinogen levels above the 95 % confidence limits of this equation. In contrast, there was no age related decline in serum trypsinogen among the CF group with pancreatic sufficiency. Under 7 yr, serum trypsinogen failed to distinguish the two groups. In those over 7 yr of age, however, serum trypsinogen was significantly higher than the CF group with pancreatic insufficiency (p < 0. 001), and 93 % had values within or above the control range. In conclusion, serum trypsinogen appears to be a useful screening test for CF in infancy. Between 2 and 7 yr of age this test is of little diagnostic value. After 7 yr of age, serum trypsinogen can reliably distinguish between CF patients with and without pancreatic insufficiency...|$|R
40|$|Although Gaucher {{disease is}} a rare disorder, recent {{developments}} in novel means for therapeutic intervention have invigorated both academic research and pharmaceutical industry discovery programmes.

40|$|Gene {{therapy is}} an {{alternative}} treatment for genetic lung disease, especially monogenic disorders such as cystic fibrosis. Cystic fibrosis is a severe autosomal recessive disease affecting one in 2500 live births in the white population, caused by mutation of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). The disease is classically characterized by pancreatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> an increased concentration of chloride in sweat, and varying severity of chronic obstructive lung disease. Currently, the greatest challenge for gene therapy is finding an ideal vector to deliver the transgene (CFTR) to the affected organ (lung).

40|$|Patients with {{pancreatic}} agenesis {{are born}} without a pancreas, causing permanent neonatal diabetes and pancreatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> These patients require insulin and enzyme replacement therapy to survive, grow, and maintain normal blood glucose levels. Pancreatic agenesis is an uncommon condition but high-throughput sequencing methods provide {{a rare opportunity}} to identify critical genes that are necessary for human pancreas development. Here we present the clinical history, evaluation, and the genetic and molecular analysis from two patients with pancreatic agenesis. Both patients were born with intrauterine growth restriction, minor heart defects and neonatal diabetes. In both cases, pancreatic agenesis was confirmed by imaging studies. The patients are clinically stable with pancreatic enzymes and insulin therapy. In order identify the etiology for their disease, we performed whole exome sequencing on both patients. For each proband we identified a de novo heterozygous mutation in the GATA 6 gene. GATA 6 is a homeobox containing transcription factor involved in both early development of the pancreas and heart. In vitro functional analysis of one of the variants revealed that the mutation creates a premature stop codon in the coding sequence resulting in the production of a truncated protein with loss of activity. These results show how genetic mutations in GATA 6 may lead to functional inactivity and pancreatic agenesis in humans...|$|E
40|$|Pteridines {{are widely}} {{distributed}} compounds in nature, associated with numerous important physiological functions. BH 4 {{is classified as}} unconjugated pteridine distinct from folic acid and its metabolites folates representing the group of conjugated pteridines. Unlike folic acid, which is a vitamin, BH 4 can be synthesized in organism. Tetrahydrobiopterin (BH 4) is a cofactor, important for different biological processes, present in probably all cells and tissues of higher organisms. The presence of persistent hyperphenylalaninemia with atypic neurological symptoms in children, resistent to diet poor in phenylalanin, which disappears upon BH 4 application, gave a strong impuls {{to the study of}} this unconjugated pteridine metabolic functions. BH 4 is a natural cofactor of cyclic amino acid hydroxylases - phenylalanin hydroxylase (EC 1. 14. 16. 2), tyrosine- 3 -hydroxylase (EC 1. 14. 16. 3) and tryptophane- 5 -hydroxylase (EC 1. 14. 16. 4) as well as all three isoenzymes of nitric oxide synthase (NOS). It is neccessary for the activity of glyceryl-ether-monooxygenase (1. 14. 16. 5). The regeneration of tetrahydrobiopterin is neccessary for the catalytic activity of these <b>enzymes.</b> BH 4 <b>insufficiency</b> disturbs the function of mentioned hydroxylases leading to disorders of their products synthesis, especially 5 -hydroxytryptophane, the precursor of serotonine and L-DOPA (the precursor of catecholamines). These metabolites function as neurotransmitters in brain and their deficit causes CNS diseases (including disturbed psychomotoric development, disfunction of basal ganglia and instability of body temperature. The whole content of BH 4 present in organism originates from de novo synthesis of this compound. Tetrahydrobiopterin deficit disturbs the function of all three isoenzymes of NOS: NOS-I or neuronal, macrophagal or inducible (NOS-II) and endothelial (NOS-III), leading to decreased production of NO and increased production of superoxide anion. The inhibition of GTP cyclohydrolase 1 (GCH 1), the key enzyme in tetrahydrobiopterin biosynthesis, which uses exclusively magnesium-free GTP as substrate, lessens vasodilation and causes increase of blood pressure. Tetrahydrobiopterin is neccessary in the prevention of blood vessel damage and for normal function of endothelial cells in diabetes. BH 4 regulates normal proliferation of endothelial cells (EC), which produce NO under the influence of NOS-III. The result of decreased NO production by endothelial cells in diabetes is disturbed angiogenesis, which directly depends on BH 4 level, as a cofactor of nitric oxide synthesis. It is a very interesting fact that this cofactor is synthesized from GTP, nucleoside triphosphate also neccessary for the synthesis of proteins, {{as well as for the}} functioning of adenyl cyclase system, needed for the production of cAMP, secondary messenger neccessary for adrenalin, glucagon and other hormones action. The stimulation of tetrahydrobiopterin synthesis by cytokines undoubtly points out biological functions of pteridines in organism immune response. Tissue distribution of BH 4 indicates the fact that renal tissue is the richest in this metabolite compared to brain and liver tissue; it calls for the need of investigating BH 4 physiological functions in kidney. The importance of BH 4 in tyrosine production (neccessary for the synthesis of thyreoid gland hormones, T 3 and T 4, the production of neurotransmitters - DOPA, dopamine, noradrenalin), synthesis of serotonine and melatonine, the function of endothelial cells by production of NO, normal angiogenesis, maintaining of normal blood pressure, points out further directions of the investigation of biological functions of this very important cofactor of intermediary metabolism...|$|R
40|$|Pancreatic exocrine {{dysfunction}} {{has been}} frequently recorded in protein-energy malnutrition in underdeveloped countries. In addition, the pancreas requires optimal nutrition for enzyme synthesis and potentially correctable pancreatic <b>enzyme</b> <b>insufficiency</b> {{may play a}} role in the continuation of protein-energy malnutrition. This problem has not been previously evaluated in Australian Aborigines. We have applied a screening test for pancreatic dysfunction (human immunoreactive trypsinogen [IRT] assay) to the study of 398 infants (6 - 36 months) admitted to the Alice Springs Hospital over a 20 -month period. All infants were assessed by anthropometric measures and were assigned to three nutritional groups (normal, moderate or severely malnourished) and two growth groups (stunted or not stunted). Of the 198 infants who had at least a single serum cationic trypsinogen measurement taken, normal values for serum IRT (with confidence limits) were obtained from 57 children, who were normally nourished. IRT levels were significantly correlated with the degree of underweight but there was no correlation with the degree of stunting or age. Mean IRT levels for the moderate and severely underweight groups were significantly greater than the mean for the normal group (P < 0. 01). Seventeen children (8. 6 %) had trypsinogen levels in excess of the 95 th percentile for the normally nourished group, reflecting acinar cell damage or ductal obstruction. We conclude that pancreatic dysfunction may be a common and important overlooked factor contributing to ongoing malnutrition and disease in malnourished Australian Aboriginal children...|$|E
40|$|Cellular {{repair of}} DNA damage due to lethal gamma {{irradiation}} was studied to reveal differences between strains and cell cycle stages that are otherwise difficult to detect. Cycling and metaphase-blocked cultures of normal fibroblasts and carcinoma cells were compared for repair of gamma sites (gamma radiation-induced nicks, breaks, and alkalilabile sites in DNA) at supralethal exposures ranging from 7 to 150 krad 137 Cs radiation and at postirradiation incubations of 20 - 180 min. Fibroblasts from normal human skin or lung repaired gamma sites efficiently when cycling {{but did not}} repair them when blocked at mitosis. Bladder (253 J) or lung (A 549) carcinoma cells, unlike normal fibroblasts, repaired gamma sites efficiently even when blocked at mitosis. HeLa cells degraded their DNA soon after exposure at all doses tested, regardless of mitotic arrest. Whether the above differences in DNA repair between cell cycle stages and between strains result from differences in chromatin structure (cis effects) or from differences in the nuclear enzymatic environment (trans effects) could be resolved by placing an inert, extrachromosomal DNA molecule in the cell nucleus. Specifically, cis effects should be confined to the host chromosomes {{and would not be}} detected in the inert probe whereas trans effects should be detected in host chromosomes and inert probe DNA alike. Indeed, we found a suitable DNA molecule in the adenovirus deletion mutant dl 312, which does not proliferate in the absence of E 1 A complementation. Gamma sites in 32 P-labeled adenovirus dl 312 DNA were repaired efficiently in all hosts, regardless of mitotic arrest. Failure of mitosis-arrested fibroblasts to repair gamma sites was therefore due to a cis effect of chromatin organization rather than to a trans effect such as repair <b>enzyme</b> <b>insufficiency.</b> In sharp contrast, chromosomes of mitotic carcinoma cells remained accessible to repair enzymes and nucleases alike. By means of these new tools, we should get a better understanding of higher-order chromatin management in normal and cancer cells...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{we used a}} {{preclinical}} model of induced lipolytic <b>enzyme</b> <b>insufficiency,</b> and hypothesized {{that the use of}} monoacylglycerols (MAG) will enhance their bioavailability and delivery to the tissues. Experimental diets containing 20 % lipids were fed to rats for 21 days with or without Orlistat. The control diet of fish oil (FO), a source of EPA and DHA, was tested against: structured (A) vanillin acetal of sn- 2 MAG (Vanil + O) and (B) diacetyl derivative of sn- 2 MAG (Acetyl + O) and (C) free MAG (MAG + O). FA profiles with an emphasis on EPA and DHA levels were determined in plasma, red blood cells (RBC), liver, spleen, brain and retina. We observed significant reduction of lipid absorption when rats co-consumed Orlistat. As expected, the FO groups with and without Orlistat showed the biggest difference. The Vanil + O, Acetyl + O and MAG + O groups, demonstrated higher levels of EPA (5. 5 &# 177; 1. 9, 4. 6 &# 177; 1. 6 and 5. 6 &# 177; 0. 6, respectively) in RBC compared with FO + O diets (3. 3 &# 177; 0. 2, 2. 6 &# 177; 0. 2). Levels of EPA incorporation, in plasma, were similar to those obtained for RBC, and similar trends were observed for the collected tissues and even with DHA levels. These observations with two MAG derivatives providing the fatty acid esterified in the sn- 2 position, show that these molecules are efficient vehicles of EPA in malabsorption conditions which is in line with our hypothesis. Free MAG, characterized as having exclusively sn- 1 (3) isomers of EPA, demonstrated better absorption efficiencies and accretion to tissues when compared to structured MAG. The study demonstrated that structured and free MAG can be used efficiently as an enteral vehicle to supply bioactive fatty acids such as EPA and DHA in lipid malabsorption where diminished lipolytic activity is the underlying cause...|$|E
