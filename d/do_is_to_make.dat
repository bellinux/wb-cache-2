[...] He has no intentions to preach his beliefs through his art, believing that people should be free to make up their own minds and that the best he can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> readers ponder the deeper meanings behind a humorous scene.

With them down there, I have only to watch my chance and slip in. It won't take but a second. Just a little courage, Blacky, just a little courage! Nothing in this world worth having is gained without some risk. The thing to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure that the risk is as small as possible." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We won't {{speak about}} that now," [...] said Mr. Harrison. [...] "All {{we want you}} to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a {{complete}} confession of your knowledge of the affair." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Jane Withersteen, either you're a fool or noble {{beyond my}} understandin'. Mebbe you're both. I know you're blind. What you meant is one thing--what you <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> me love you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What I want to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> people think," [...] he said, {{turning his}} {{prominent}} eyes {{on to his}} hostess; [...] "it's so hard to make people think." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't you {{be put off}} by his seeming a bit unresponsive," [...] Mrs. Phillips would explain. [...] "He's shy with women. What I'm {{trying to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him feel {{you are one of}} the family." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I believe," [...] said Little Joe as {{he wiped}} tears of {{laughter}} from his eyes, [...] "that Grandfather Frog is right, {{and that the}} best thing I can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> friends with Buster Bear. I'll try it to-morrow morning." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] said Leland. [...] "He earns his pay, and all I <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it {{a little}} easier for him. He got himself mixed up with a {{threshing}} mill at another place a while ago." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I fancy {{the best}} we can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a drag for each deer and each pull his own load home," [...] went on Dave. [...] "If we leave one here the wolves and foxes will soon finish the meat." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My Mansoul,' said he, 'that which I now {{am about}} to <b>do,</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you known to {{the world to be}} mine, and to {{distinguish}} you also in your own eyes, from all false traitors that may creep in among you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{best thing}} we can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> all {{arrangements}} for going on our tour bright and early Monday morning," [...] went on Snap. [...] "We will have from now on to get ready in. That {{will be plenty of}} time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "That's good! Now all you've got to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{sure where}} {{he keeps his}} swag. Only do be quick about it! I can't stand much longer this crawling-on-the-stomach {{business}} {{so as not to}} scare your gentleman. What do you think a fellow is--a reptile?" ...|$|E

The settlor already holds {{title to the}} property and all that needs <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a valid declaration. However, a declaration of trust {{will not be allowed}} out of an invalid gift.|$|R
6000|$|... "I reckon. But {{the best}} we could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him stand fer a guard. There's four of us cowpunchers with him all day, an' at night he's {{surrounded}} by guards. There ain't much chance of his gittin' hurt. So you needn't worry about thet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{was part}} of a larger process," [...] said Scrope patiently. [...] "I had been {{drifting}} into a complete repudiation of the Anglican positions long before that.

6000|$|... "Well, Dias," [...] Bertie said, [...] "everyone {{knows that}} the demons cannot {{withstand}} {{the sign of the}} cross.

6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Harry, [...] "we're {{not going}} to quarrel about the thing. What we have to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a bee-line home. We'll come along again {{in a week or}} two. The ponds are full of ducks for a little in the spring and fall." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You {{must run}} for your life, Will. There are {{four or five}} of the men who say that you betrayed them last night, and I do believe they will throw you over the cliff. Here they come!

We mustn't be in {{too much of a}} hurry, or we may spill the soup." ...|$|R
50|$|The Chinese Representative Council met {{daily to}} discuss issues {{but was not}} {{entrusted}} with any real power. All the council could <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> suggestions and try to persuade the government to accept it. It was also responsible for raising the East Asia Construction Fund for the relief of the starving.|$|R
60|$|June 15.--I laboured all the evening, {{but made}} little way. There <b>were</b> many books <b>to</b> consult; {{and so all}} I could really <b>do</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> out my task of three pages. I will try <b>to</b> <b>make</b> up the deficit of Tuesday to-day and to-morrow. Letters from Walter--all well. A visit {{yesterday}} from Charles Sharpe.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{he seems}} to be pretty well fixed here, and I don't see but what the thing for the rest of you birds to <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best of the matter," [...] said Peter. [...] "What I want to know is whether or not he is of any use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What can't {{be cured}} must be endured," [...] said John again. [...] "The {{only thing to}} <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the best of it, and get on as we can.

6000|$|... "She's twigged it all along," [...] he said, with conviction. [...] "You'll have to {{come home}} with me tonight, and to-morrow {{the best thing you}} can <b>do</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a clean breast of it. It was a silly game, and, if you remember, I was against it from the first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, I won't screen myself {{behind the}} poor child," [...] I replied. [...] "To speak as I <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{an attempt at}} evasion, and I <b>am</b> ill-accustomed <b>to</b> dissemble. I did not {{infringe}} the letter of my agreement, but I acted against the spirit of it. From this moment I annul it altogether." ...|$|R
5000|$|On [...] "Streetcar" [...] {{we worked}} very hard to open it up, and then went back to the play because we'd lost all the compression. In the play, these people were trapped in a room with each other. What I {{actually}} <b>did</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> the set smaller. As the story progressed ... the set got smaller and smaller.|$|R
60|$|I have <b>been</b> {{concerned}} <b>to</b> hear of your indisposition, {{but thought}} {{the best thing}} I could <b>do,</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> no formal calls when you were really ill. I have been suffering myself from another kind of malady--a severe, spasmodic, house-buying-and-repairing attack--which has left me extremely weak and all but exhausted. The seat of the disorder has been the pocket.|$|R
