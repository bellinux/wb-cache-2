40|$|Government {{measures}} for promoting innovation in industry Technology and innovation {{play a major}} role in wealth creation and economic growth. Governments in all OECD countries have put in place various mechanisms aimed at providing public support for firms, including the provision of public funds, incentives, investment support, technical services and scientific and technological infrastructure. Identifying and measuring the impact of public support to industry is a difficult task. Recent OECD studies analyse transfers to industrial firms which are categorised in two groups: the first consisting of money transfers (for R&D and innovation contracts, and for procurement of innovated products and processes); the second of financial incentives (regular <b>grants,</b> reimbursable <b>grants,</b> <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies,</b> regular loans, conditional loans, guarantees, equity capital, tax concessions, mixed financial incentives) (OECD, 1997). While the identification of the various measures taken by governments and their comparison across countries has been carried out in a satisfactory way, the quantification of the funds involved is still a difficult task. This information, however, provides a picture of the financial effort made by governments in pursuing their innovation and industrial policies...|$|R

Actual agricultural support in the EU far exceeds the funds allocated in the agricultural envelope of the EU budget.

Our analysis unveils a number of relevant policy lessons for the design of housing subsidy programs, namely: (a) Under fiscal neutrality (same government outlay), both subsidies have the same positive effect on the ability and willingness to repay. But, for such neutrality to hold, the percentage <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> must be larger than the downpayment subsidy, which is rare to happen in practice; (b) The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> raises the loan size a bank is willing to grant, but the downpayment subsidy does not, the reason being that the latter actually diminishes the need for bank financing for a given property value; (c) When targeting lower income households, the downpayment subsidy is superior to the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy,</b> as the former increases the loan-to-value and debt-to-income ratios, two key criteria for mortgage borrower eligibility. By the same token, the downpayment subsidy is more likely to have a stronger effect on low and medium value housing units; (d) Such progressivity comes at the cost of a higher probability of default, meaning that some trade-off between equity and financial stability may emerge; (e) Subsidies are likely to put upward pressure on housing prices. The downpayment subsidy has a direct effect (by injecting fiscal resources to cover part of the property price) and an indirect effect (by easing the access to the mortgage market); (f) The <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> only has the latter effect; and (g) Compared to the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy,</b> the downpayment support promotes a less aggressive competition in the real estate market...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} effects of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> credit <b>subsidies</b> on {{economic}} development in a general equilibrium model with heterogeneous agents, occupational choice and financial frictions. There are two financial frictions: a cost to intermediate loans and a limited liability problem which maps into the degree of enforcement of credit contracts in the economy. Occupational choice and firm size are determined endogenously by an agent’s type (ability and net wealth) and the credit market frictions. We then add a credit program in this economy that subsidizes the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> on loans. There is a fixed cost (which might be null) to apply for such loans {{in the form of}} bureaucracy and regulations. We show that for the United States, an <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> credit <b>subsidy</b> does not {{have a significant effect on}} output per capita, but it can have important negative effects on wages and government finances. For Brazil, a developing country in which financial repression is high and the government subsidies heavily loans, our counter-factual exercises show that if the country cuts all interest subsidies, there will no significant quantitative effect on output per capita, wages, inequality and government finances. However, when the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> is fixed at the level observed in Brazil, but access to the credit program is increased, then output and wages might both increase, as long as the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> does not not affect directly the spread on non-subsidized loans...|$|R

The analysis is done both in a general qualitative manner and quantitatively for the case of Czech Supporting and Guarantee Agricultural and Forestry Fund (SGAFF). In the quantitative part of the paper we show that the portfolio of the SGAFF has a sufficient value to cover expected costs of credit guarantees and subsidies provided by the SGAFF. The qualitative theoretical model is dealing with government interventions designed to decrease the credit rationing of good farmers.

Consequently, it is shown that variability in land prices alone is a sufficient condition for land speculation, inflated rates of investment in land, larger farm sizes and, thus, higher rates of deforestation in agrarian frontier areas, while this process is further promoted by subsidized livestock credit or any other form of agricultural subsidy that increases the marginal production value of lan...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} land speculation on investment decisions by cattle ranchers in Latin America, and the subsequent consequences for deforestation under varying levels of land price uncertainty and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy.</b> Based on the Neoclassical investment theory, a stochastic reversible investment model with adjustment costs is developed in which land prices are modeled as a geometric Brownian motion. Analytical results indicate that: 1) the optimal rate of investment {{is dependent on the}} price of land at a specific moment in time, 2) the value of the farm increases with the variance in land prices due to speculative returns from land, and 3) the maximum farm size attained over time will be larger, the larger the variance in land prices.

This effect is further reinforced in combination with lower <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies.</b> Consequently, it can be concluded that variability in land prices alone is a sufficient condition for land speculation and subsequent deforestation of agrarian frontier areas by cattle ranchers in the Atlantic Zone of Costa Rica, and that this deforestation is further promoted by subsidized livestock credi...|$|R

With a broad-brush approach the subsidies for TICAL-type arrangements and for current debt levels turn out to be between 25 and 40 per cent, but are about zero for our suggested alternative ICLs. Using a better, more disaggregated, approach, subsidies for TICAL-type schemes are estimated to be about 30 - 55, and 3 and 18 per cent for our alternative ICLs.

40|$|There {{is arguably}} a {{consensus}} that the current approach to drought relief {{is in need of}} reform and possibly replacement with an improved government financial assistance mechanism. Grants to farmers, in the form of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidies,</b> have several difficulties, which in summary are as follows: i. There are typically too few financial resources to be drawn from government to address adequately and equitably the needs of farms in a dire drought situation. ii. The rationing arising from (i) means that access to assistance requires complex eligibility criteria, resulting in application and administrative processes that are complex and thus expensive for both farmers and government. iii. Grants for drought relief are financed by contributions from all taxpayers, and it is very likely to be the case that this is regressive. Average taxpayers will be less wealthy and have fewer other economic advantages than the majority of farmers assisted through drought relief. This paper outlines the potential advantages and challenges associated with the implementation of income related loan arrangements for drought relief as a possible alternative to the existing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>subsidy</b> scheme. The conceptual basis of income related loans is explained, and reference is made to the application of policies of this type in other areas of government financial intervention. The paper addresses the administrative challenges associated with such a policy reform, with reference to the idiosyncrasies of agricultural financing. An illustrative example is offered of what an income related loan applied to drought assistance might mean for the time stream of both revenue for the Commonwealth budget and repayment obligations for farms differing by economic size. income related loans, drought policy, agricultural subsidies...|$|R
