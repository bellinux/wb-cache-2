5|$|Birt, Hogg, and Dubé {{examined}} {{a family with}} a hereditary thyroid cancer and discovered {{that many of the}} members had fibrofolliculomas, trichodiscomas, and acrochordons, which became defined as the classical symptoms of the eponymous disease. The <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of spontaneous pneumothorax associated with BHD was discovered in 1986; the <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of renal cancer followed in 1993 and the presence of lung cysts in people with BHD was confirmed in 1999. It was formerly thought that people with Birt–Hogg–Dubé syndrome were at higher risk for colorectal polyps and neoplasms, but this has been disproven. The BHD Foundation supports research into the syndrome and holds regular symposia in BHD and related disorders for researchers, clinicians, and family members.|$|E

5|$|Brady was {{admitted}} to the New York Bar in either 1835 or 1836, when he was about twenty years old. His <b>first</b> <b>case</b> was an insurance proceeding, where he opposed the prominent lawyer, Charles O'Connor. The plaintiff staked a claim for insurance money from a property allegedly burned down by a fire. Though Brady lost that case, his proficiency for law and oration was immediately noted.|$|E
5|$|During routine {{maintenance}} work at Karori Sanctuary in late 2008, a tuatara nest was uncovered, with a hatchling found the following autumn. This {{is thought to}} be the <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of tuatara successfully breeding in the wild on the New Zealand mainland in over 200 years.|$|E
5|$|In 1840 {{he wrote}} the <b>first</b> <b>case</b> report by a black doctor, which his {{associate}} John Watson read {{at a meeting of}} the New York Medical and Surgical Society. (It acknowledged Smith was qualified, but would not admit him because of racial discrimination.) Soon after, Smith published an article in the New York Journal of Medicine, the first by a black doctor in the US.|$|E

5|$|On October 13, 2010 President Yanukovych sacked two {{deputy prime}} ministers (Viktor Slauta and Volodymyr Sivkovich).

5|$|The {{diagnosis}} is achieved with {{magnetic resonance imaging}} and blood tests. Treatment is by the timely correction of hormone deficiencies, {{and in many cases}} surgical decompression is required. Many people who have had a pituitary apoplexy develop pituitary hormone deficiencies and require long-term hormone supplementation. The <b>first</b> <b>case</b> of the disease was recorded in 1898.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>case</b> {{description}} of pituitary apoplexy has {{been attributed to}} the American neurologist Pearce Bailey in 1898. This was followed in 1905 by a further report from the German physician Bleibtreu. Surgery for pituitary apoplexy was described in 1925. Before the introduction of steroid replacement, the mortality from pituitary apoplexy approximated 50%.|$|E
5|$|The pinnae have {{an effect}} on facial appearance. In Western societies, {{protruding}} ears (present in about 5% of ethnic Europeans) have been considered unattractive, particularly if asymmetric. The first surgery to reduce the projection of prominent ears was published in the medical literature by Ernst Dieffenbach in 1845, and the <b>first</b> <b>case</b> report in 1881.|$|E

The <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> are reported of predation by the barn owl and the long-eared owl on the European scops owl {{to be observed}} in the Balearic Islands. These cases are attributed to opportunism presented by the high numbers of European scops owls on passage during the migration periods...|$|R

5|$|After briefly reading {{law with}} former New Hampshire Governor Levi Woodbury, a family friend, in Portsmouth, {{he spent a}} {{semester}} at Northampton Law School in Northampton, Massachusetts, followed by a period of study in 1826 and 1827 under Judge Edmund Parker in Amherst, New Hampshire. He {{was admitted to the}} New Hampshire bar in late 1827 and began to practice in Hillsborough. Pierce lost his <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> but soon proved capable as a lawyer. Despite never being a legal scholar, his memory for names and faces served him well, as did his personal charm and deep voice. In Hillsborough, his law partner was Albert Baker, who had studied law under Pierce and was the brother of Mary Baker Eddy.|$|E
5|$|After the war, courts-martial were convened to {{investigate}} possible war crimes {{by members of}} the division. In the <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> dubbed the Biscari massacre, American troops from C Company, 180th Infantry Regiment, were alleged to have shot 74 Italian and two German prisoners in Acate in July 1943 following the capture of an airfield in the area. Lieutenant General George Patton, the Seventh Army commander, asked Major General Omar Bradley, commanding II Corps, to get the case dismissed to prevent bad press, but Bradley refused. A non-commissioned officer later confessed to the crimes and was found guilty, but an officer who claimed he had only been following orders was acquitted.|$|E
5|$|Also, {{there have}} been a few unorthodox (unusual) causes of solar urticaria. For those {{susceptible}} to visible light, white T-shirts may increase the chances of experiencing an outbreak. In one case, doctors found that the white T-shirt absorbed UVA radiation from the sun and transformed it into visible light which caused the reaction. Another patient was being treated with the antibiotic tetracycline for a separate dermatological disorder and broke out in hives when exposed to the sun, the <b>first</b> <b>case</b> to implicate tetracycline as a solar urticaria inducing agent.|$|E

50|$|The Antonio Vilas Boas case (1957) and the Hill {{abduction}} (1961) {{were the}} <b>first</b> <b>cases</b> of UFO abduction to earn widespread attention.|$|R
5|$|Finally, two special transformations {{are used}} to invert the {{coordinate}} system in space, space inversion, and in time, time reversal. In the <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> the space coordinate axes are reversed. The latter is reversal of the time direction. This is thought of, in the passive view, as having the observer set their clock at minus what it shows and then have the clock's hands move counterclockwise. Physical time progresses forward.|$|E
5|$|Following the restoration, William Bruce was {{appointed}} Clerk to the Bills in 1660, and Clerk of Supply to the Lords in Council in 1665. Both were lucrative positions, involving collection of fees, from Parliament in the <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> and from petitioners to the Court of Session in the latter. Meanwhile, Sir Robert Moray had {{established himself as}} a courtier and scientist at Whitehall, London, and employed Bruce as a trusted messenger between Whitehall and the Duke of Lauderdale, Secretary for Scotland.|$|E
5|$|In 1888, Audrain County, Missouri {{was moved}} from the Eastern to the Western District. In 1897, it was {{moved back to the}} Eastern district. In 1891, the United States circuit courts were {{eliminated}} in favor of the new United States courts of appeals. When the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit heard its <b>first</b> <b>case,</b> on October 12, 1891, the presiding judge Henry Clay Caldwell was joined by two district court judges from within the jurisdiction of the Circuit. One of those was Amos Madden Thayer of the Eastern District of Missouri. Thayer would later be appointed to the Eight Circuit in his own right.|$|E
