50|$|The best of Sandgren's {{bindings}} are in {{a simple}} and timeless design. On his famous full leather bindings, of which he made around 100, the decoration {{is limited to a}} gilt frame near the edges of the sides - e.g. a gilt line, pattern or geometric design - and the large central area of the sides are free from decoration, so the quality and colour of the leather is in focus. Sandgren only used the very best in goatskin or Morocco leather with a beautiful, natural structure, and his bindings are in subdued, darker colours, for example brown or red. His principle is not unlike the Danish furniture designers, like Hans Wegner, where the natural colors, textures and flexibility of the wood are highlighted in their furniture.August Sandgren only used a small number of stamps to <b>decorate</b> the <b>spines</b> of the bindings, but he used them with great variety. He used marbled sidepaper, handmade by himself, and they were kept in darker colors - brown, black, dark green and blue, and the most beautiful paper has vertical, dense stripes.|$|R
