40|$|Road {{transport}} may {{be deemed}} a strategic branch of modern economy. Unfortunately, a {{rapid increase in}} the number of on-road motor vehicles entails some negative consequences as well, for instance, excessive concentration of exhausts produced by engines which results in deterioration of air quality. EURO emission standards which define acceptable limits for exhaust <b>emissions</b> <b>of</b> power units is an example of an activity performed in attempt to improve air quality. The EURO standard defines permissible amount of exhausts produced by a vehicle. Presently new units are examined through NEDC test. For the purpose of this thesis, a virtual test stand in a form of a computer simulation of a chassis dynamometer was used to simulate <b>emission</b> <b>of</b> a diesel engine (compression-ignition engine) in the NEDC test. Actual parameters of the 1. 3 MultiJet engine of the Fiat Panda passenger car of 2014 were applied in the model. The simulation was carried out in the Matlab Simulink environment. The simulation model of the Fiat Panda passenger car enables the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>emission</b> waveform for all test stages which corresponds to the values received during an approval test in real-life conditions...|$|R

The persons inscribed in the document most likely did not have surnames at that time. Men were usually identified by name and patronymic or by name only. Women were most often identified by a personal name made from the spouse’s name or a personal name from the spouse’s name and his patronymic. All the men and only one-quarter {{of the women were}} identified by name. Patronymic designations were typical for the majority of men and only used once as the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> a woman. Some men were designated with their father’s patronymic. Almost all of the men’s patronymics had Slavic suffixes. Lithuanian suffixes in patronymics were used only three times. Some identifications of men included personal names from the <b>designation</b> <b>of</b> family members (mother, stepfather, father-in-law). Titles were more typically used to identify women than men. Titles of marital status and kinship dominated the <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> both sexes.

Most <b>of</b> the <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> men were binary and <b>designations</b> <b>of</b> women consisted of a single element. A few persons were designated only by a name.
