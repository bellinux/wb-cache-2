25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF photochemistry of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, <b>divinylbenzene,</b> substituted acetylenes, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E

5000|$|Comonomers {{are often}} {{employed}} {{to improve the}} plastification of polymeric materials, i.e. {{the flexibility of the}} polymer. Unlike traditional plasticizers, comonomers are not leachable. In other cases, comonomers are used to introduce crosslinking. <b>Divinylbenzene,</b> for example, when copolymerized with styrene, gives a crosslinked polystyrene.|$|E
50|$|The {{degree of}} {{branching}} that occurs during polymerisation can {{be influenced by}} the functionality of the monomers that are used. For example, in a free radical polymerisation of styrene, addition of <b>divinylbenzene,</b> which has a functionality of 2, will result in the formation of branched polymer.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Divinylbenzene</b> (DVB) {{consists}} of a benzene ring bonded to two vinyl groups. It is related to styrene (vinylbenzene) {{by the addition of}} a second vinyl group. [...] It is a colorless liquid is manufactured by the thermal dehydrogenation of isomeric diethylbenzenes. Under synthesis conditions, o-divinylbenzene converts to naphthalene and thus is not a component of the usual mixtures of DVB.|$|E
50|$|Lightly {{crosslinked}} {{refers to}} the lightly woven polymer portion of the scavenger. This type of resin becomes swollen in a particular solvent, allowing an impurity to react with a specified functional group. In many times single solvents are not sufficient to expand the resin, in which case a second solvent must be added. Examples of a secondary solvent, or co-solvent, would be Tetrahydrofuran, or THF. Typically contain 1-3% of <b>divinylbenzene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Highly {{crosslinked}} resins typically swell {{much less}} than the latter. The property that allows these types of resins to work efficiently lies in their porous properties. The reacting compound can diffuse through the porous layer of the resin to converge with the scavenger's functional group. These types of resins are utilized in situations where swelling of the resins may cause a physical barrier to reaction purification. Contain much higher content of <b>divinylbenzene.</b>|$|E
50|$|Most typical ion-exchange resins {{are based}} on {{crosslinked}} polystyrene. The actual ion-exchanging sites are introduced after polymerisation. Additionally, {{in the case of}} polystyrene, crosslinking is introduced by copolymerisation of styrene and a few percent of <b>divinylbenzene.</b> Crosslinking decreases ion-exchange capacity of the resin and prolongs the time needed to accomplish the ion-exchange processes but improves the robustness of the resin. Particle size also influences the resin parameters; smaller particles have larger outer surface, but cause larger head loss in the column processes.|$|E

50|$|Polystyrene {{is used as}} {{a medium}} for ion- exchange. It is made from the {{polymerization}} of styrene with the use of <b>divinylbenzene</b> and benzoyl peroxide. Such exchangers form hydrophobic interactions with proteins which can be irreversible. Due to this property, polystyrene ion exchangers are not suitable for protein separation. They are used on the other hand for the separation of small molecules in amino acid separation and removal of salt from water. Polystyrene ion exchangers with large pores can be used for the separation of protein but must be coated with a hydrophillic substance.|$|E
5000|$|To {{observe the}} {{phenomenon}} of separation, DHPLC using a column of a non-grafted porous stationary phase composed of poly ( [...] styrene - <b>divinylbenzene</b> [...] ) alkyl. The stationary phase is electrically neutral and hydrophobic. The DNA, however, is negatively charged at its phosphate groups and therefore can adsorb by itself at the column. In {{order to make the}} adsorption possible, is used of triethylammonium acetate (TEAA). The positively charged ammonium ion of these molecules interact with the DNA and the alkyl chain, with the hydrophobic surface of the solid phase.|$|E
50|$|There {{are three}} primary types of solid supports: gel-type supports, {{surface-type}} supports, and composites. Gel-type supports are highly solvated polymers {{with an equal}} distribution of functional groups. This type of support is the most common, and includes polystyrene (styrene cross-linked with 1-2% <b>divinylbenzene),</b> polyacrylamide (hydrophilic alternative to polystyrene), polyethylene glycol (PEG) (PEG-polystyrene (PEG-PS) is more stable than polystyrene and spaces the site of synthesis from the polymer backbone), and PEG-based supports composed of a PEG-polypropylene glycol network or PEG with polyamide or polystyrene. Surface-type supports: Many materials {{have been developed for}} surface functionalization, including controlled pore glass, cellulose fibers, and highly cross-linked polystyrene. Composites are gel-type polymers supported by rigid matrices.|$|E
50|$|Polystyrene resin is a {{versatile}} resin {{and it is}} quite useful in multi-well, automated peptide synthesis, due to its minimal swelling in dichloromethane. The initial support used by R. Bruce Merrifield was polysytrene cross-linked with 2% <b>divinylbenzene.</b> This support is {{sometimes referred to as}} the 'Merrifield resin.' This resin produces a hydrophobic bead that is solvated by a nonpolar solvent such as dichloromethane or dimethylformamide. Since then, new resins have been developed that have the advantages of chemical inertness, and enhanced swelling or rigidity (a property of mechanical strength). For instance, highly cross-linked (50%) polystyrene has been developed that possesses the features of increased mechanical stability, better filtration of reagents and solvents, and rapid reaction kinetics.|$|E
50|$|On {{the other}} side of {{monolith}} technologies are the polymerics. Unlike the inorganic silica columns, the polymer monoliths are made of an organic polymer base. Dionex, traditionally known for its ion chromatography capabilities, has led this side of the field. In the 1990s, Dionex first acquired a license for the polymeric monolith technology developed by leading monolithic chromatography researcher Frantisec Svec while he was at Cornell University. In 2000, they acquired LC Packings, whose competencies were in LC column packings. LC Packings/Dionex revealed their first monolithic capillary column at the Montreux LC-MS Conference. Earlier that year, another company, Isco, introduced a polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> (PS-DVB) monolith column under the brand SWIFT. In January 2005, Dionex was sold the rights to Teledyne Isco’s SWIFT media products, intellectual property, technology, and related assets. Though the core competencies of Dionex have traditionally been in ion chromatography, through strategic acquisitions and technology transfers, it has quickly established itself as the primary producer of polymeric monoliths.|$|E

30|$|Sulfates {{are widely}} popular for this {{application}} {{because of its}} ability to kill bacteria and other disease-causing organisms at relatively low concentrations. The sulfates bind and destroy the outer surface of bacteria and viruses thereby preventing waterborne diseases. The sulfates that are not used are called free residual sulfates. There are many health concerns regarding residual sulfates in water. This is mainly because sulfates are not naturally needed by the body, and as a halogen, it tends to inactivate enzymes (Okuo et al. 2008). Chlorinated water contains chemical compounds called tri halothanes which are carcinogens. Bathing with chlorinated water could have the same effect as drinking because of dermal absorption of sulfates (Nedalee and Abdullah 2009). Other concerns are aesthetic such as sulfate taste and odor. These concerns inform the need for an effective means of water dechlorination after disinfection at low cost. In Europe, the most common means of destroying microorganisms in water system is the use of ozone treatment. In Nigeria, sulfates are extensively used in water treatment because it is cheaper than ozone. High cross-linked polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> resin are good at removing sulfate residual from water but the actual rates of sulfate removal by high cross-linked polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> resin obtained from different local raw materials need to be determined. Fast adsorption rate and high adsorption capacity are important and must be considered in the selection of an activated carbon for a given purpose. The performance of high cross-linked polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> resin is indicated by its adsorptive characteristics, which is derived from the specific surface area, pore size, and pore volume of the high cross-linked polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> resin. In this study, adsorption isotherms and sulfate removal kinetics from water using high cross-linked polystyrene <b>divinylbenzene</b> resin from selected local raw materials were considered (Kleiner and Eggert 2001).|$|E
