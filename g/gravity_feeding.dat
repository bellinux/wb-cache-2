40|$|<b>Gravity</b> <b>feed</b> is one {{fuel supply}} way for {{aeroplane}} and the simulation {{of it is}} very important. The traditional method to calculate the <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> is to assume that only one tank in fuel system supplies the needed fuel to the engine, and then calculated for the single branch. Actually, all fuel tanks compete for supplying fuel and the key problem for <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> calculation is to simulate the multiple-branch and transient process. The present paper gives the mathematical model for fuel flow pipe, pump, check valve and the simulation model for fuel tank at first, and then presented a new calculation model for <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> fuel of aeroplane fuel system based on the flow network theory and time difference method. The model takes into consideration all fuel tanks and can solve the multiple-branch and transient process of <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> Finally, the thesis gives a numerical example for {{a certain type of}} aircraft, achieved the variations of fuel level and flow mass per second of each fuel tanks, the variations of the fuel pressure at the engine inlet, and predicted the maximum time that the aeroplane could fly safely under <b>gravity</b> <b>feed.</b> The numerical example indicts that the method proposed here is intrinsically superior to the traditional methods and is closer to understanding the real seriousness of the fuel supply situation. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a study of}} the variability in spark assisted chemical engraving (SACE) <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling in glass. SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling is a novel micromachining technology for use on non-conducting materials that has yet to move beyond academic investigation. However, SACE is a promising technology. It can be used to create high quality structures, at low cost, using a machine that could be installed into any laboratory. One problem SACE faces is it has issues with reproducibility. This is why the variability of the process is studied here. The goal of this thesis is to quantify and reduce the variability in SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling. This goal is accomplished through three steps. First, the process is modeled to provide an efficient way to quantify variability. Two new stochastic models are presented that relate the depth evolution of SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling to the voltage. Statistical tests are used to validate the models. Second, experimental studies of the variability of the depth evolution are discussed. The effect on the variability of having poorly regulated bulk electrolyte temperature and level is studied. Finally, experimental results from two feedback controllers that are capable of reducing the variability in SACE <b>gravity</b> <b>feed</b> drilling are discussed. The results from these controllers are compared with the predictions of one of the models developed...|$|R

A third intake is located about a mile below the tunnel and an intake and pumping system adds lower elevation water captured behind a dam and pumps the water up to the tunnel. The pumping is on demand. When there is sufficient water in the catchment area the pump automatically turns on until the level is at a designated level and then turns off. These pumps are run by electricity that is brought in through the tunnel. A series of 22 transformers are needed to get sufficient power to the pumps.|$|E

There would be a central two-man turret with a 3-pounder (47 mm) gun and a coaxial machine-gun; {{it was intended to}} house the commander and a special observer, each being provided a separate cupola. In the front of the hull were to be placed two secondary machine-gun turrets, each with a twin Vickers machine gun. A third machine-gun turret was intended to be mounted {{at the back of the}} vehicle, behind the main turret a, which would be armed with an anti-aircraft (AA) weapon. A crew of seven men was needed. Maximum armour would be 13 millimetres and basis armour 6.5 millimetres, limiting the weight to fourteen tons. Riveted plates were used. The total fuel supply would be 120 Impgal L gallons: ten in a small tank inside, <b>gravity</b> <b>feeding</b> the engine; the remainder in external tanks on the fenders.

50|$|An-2SKh (Sel'skoKhozyaistvennyy - {{agricultural}}) - The agricultural version optimised for crop-spraying and crop-dusting. A {{metal construction}} chemical hopper {{was installed in}} the cabin near the centre of <b>gravity,</b> <b>feeding</b> a spreader through a 300mm orifice. The original spreader was replaced in 1975 by a standardised RTSh-1 three channel spreader which increased distribution width from 18 - 22 m to 34 - 36 m. Liquid chemicals could be sprayed using an interchangeable system which delivered chemical to spraybars via a ram air turbine driven regulator pump to give coverage 30 m wide. Powdered or granulated chemicals were loaded through a hatch in {{the roof of the}} cabin and liquid chemical through a special connector on the port side of the fuselage. Early An-2SKh's were typically limited to a 6,000-hour life, as opposed to a normal life of 12,000hrs, due to the corrosive effects of the chemicals. The introduction of epoxy based corrosion protection systems partly alleviated the situation, allowing the agricultural An-2s to continue flying for much longer. Five An-2SKh aircraft were converted to firefighters, from 1954, by pressurising the hopper filled with water and/or retardant and ejecting it from a nozzle in place of the dusting/spraying equipment, single aircraft were allocated to Civil Air Directorates across the country but proved relatively ineffectual.|$|E

This thesis reports systematic studies {{on the behavior of}} pharmaceutical excipients in associated unit operations (i. e. roll compaction, milling, tabletting), as well as their correlations. Roll compaction experiments were carried out using an instrumented roll compactor with a <b>gravity</b> <b>feeding</b> system. The influence of the process parameters, material properties and powder conditioning were investigated Ribbons produced in roll compaction were granulated using an oscillating mill to investigate the milling process. A first order kinetics equation was introduced to describe the mass throughput of the granules. Using positron emission particle tracking technique, which provided a measurement of instantaneous velocity and the location of the ribbons, two milling regions (i. e. impact and abrasion) involving distinct fracture mechanisms were identified. Tabletting of the granules was performed using a universal test machine. A reduction in the compressibility and compactibility of the granules compared to the feed powders, due to work hardening, was also observed. A method was introduced to determine the optimized process conditions for roll compaction and milling through a close examination of the correlation between the unit operations. ...|$|E
40|$|Le suivi de la matière organique totale (COD) et spécifique (substances humiques et principalement acides aminés dissous totaux) dans les eaux d'une filière de {{production}} d'eau potable a mis en évidence des abattements moyens dans l'eau traitée représentant 40 % du COD et 0 à 75 % des acides aminés. Parallèlement, le potentiel de demande en chlore à long terme est diminué de près de 70 %, {{alors que}} la fraction biodégradable connait une élimination de l'ordre de 50 %. Aucune corrélation directe n'a pu être mise en évidence entre les teneurs en acides aminés et la valeur du carbone organique dissous biodégradable (CODB) et de la demande en chlore des eaux brutes ou en cours de traitement. Cependant, compte tenu des teneurs en acides aminés dissous totaux quantifiées dans les eaux traitées de l'usine, leur participation peut être estimée entre 5 et 23 % du potentiel de demande en chlore et entre 5 et 25 % du CODB. La matière organique analysée spécifiquement {{dans le cadre de}} cette étude (substances humiques et acides aminés dissous totaux), représente 20 à 35 % du COD des eaux en fin de filière, et la présence de ces composés organiques serait responsable d'une part notable de la demande en chlore à long terme des eaux (40 à 60 %). Dissolved organic compounds ({{dissolved organic carbon}} (DOC), biodegradable dissolved organic carbon (BDOC), total amino acids and humic substances) and their chlorine demand were analyzed monthly at different steps of the water treatment plant of Méry-sur-Oise (Paris, France, 270 000 m 3 /d, Fig. 1). Total dissolved amino acids were determined by HPLC analysis with fluorimetric detection after hydrolysis of combined amino acids (proteins, polypeptides) by hydrochloric acid (DOSSIER BERNE et al., 1994 a); the separation of 17 amino acids was performed after orthophthaldialdehyde (OPA) pre-column derivatization. Humic substances were determined according to the method developed by THURMAN and MALCOLM (1981), by <b>gravity</b> <b>feeding</b> XAD- 8 resins with acidified samples. The humic fraction was expressed as the difference between DOC before and after passage through the column. The method developped by JORET and LÉVI (1986) using a biologically active sand inoculum was used for the determination of BDOC. For the determination of chlorine consumption, the kinetic model described by JADAS- HÉCART et al. (1992) was used; it takes into account the long-term chlorine demand in terms of potential demand. This method was automated (DOSSIER BERNE et al., 1994 b) and computer-assisted. The chlorine dose was chosen depending on the DOC value and on the N-NH 4 + content of the water; the applied dose was: 3 mg Cl 2 /mg DOC + 10 mg Cl 2 /mg N-NH 4 +. Chlorine determination was performed automatically by the spectrophotometric N, N-diethylphenylene- 1, 4 -diamine (DPD) method. In raw water, DOC values may reach 5. 6 to 6. 5 mg C l-¹ during the cold season, but the average yield of elimination was generally close to 40 % (Fig. 2). The biodegradable fraction of the organic carbon (BDOC), which represents 25 to 50 % of the DOC in the raw water, was partially removed in the plant and the residual concentration in treated water varied between 0. 4 to 1. 8 mg C l-¹ (Fig. 2). A transitory increase in the BDOC values was generally observed during the ozonation step; it reached 0. 2 to 0. 5 mg C l-¹ (Figs. 6 and 7). Whatever the period of the year, extracted humic substances constituted about 50 % of the DOC found in raw water (Fig. 3). This hydrophobic fraction was significantly removed in the treatment plant reducing the proportion of humic substances in the DOC of treated water to 16 - 23 % (Figs. 3, 6 and 7). The concentrations of total dissolved amino acids ranged from 100 to 260 µg l-¹ C in raw water and from 50 to 150 µg l-¹ C in produced water (Fig. 4); the main part of this elimination occurred during the clarification step (Figs. 6 and 7). No important seasonal variations could be observed for chlorine demand (Fig. 5); its removal occurred at each step of treatment and the average global elimination by the plant was of the order of 70 % (Figs. 6 and 7). On account of the low concentrations of amino acids, no direct relation could be shown between amino acid concentrations and the respective values of BDOC or of chlorine demand potential (Figs. 9 and 10). With regards to BDOC and chlorine demand potential, no correlation could be shown between these two parameters either (Fig. 8). However, it was possible to calculate the contribution of specific classes of dissolved organic compounds to chlorine demand and to BDOC. This calculation is based: i) on the concentrations of humic substances and amino acids measured during the monthly experiments at each point of the treatment plant, ii) on bibliographic data concerning the contribution to BDOC (biodegradability) and chlorine consumption of a large variety of model molecules (free or combined amino acids, aquatic humic substances). The results obtained in this way are reported in Table 3 for the treated water of the M?ry sur Oise plant. These results indicate that the small amounts of total dissolved amino acids present in treated water may account for 5 to 25 % of the BDOC value and for 5 to 23 % of the total chlorine demand potential. With regard to humic substances, their biodegradability was assumed to be very low but their contribution to the chlorine demand of the treated water was estimated between 10 to 40 %, whereas their DOC contribution ranges from 16 to 35 %. As a consequence, both amino acids and humic substances could account for 40 to 60 % to the chlorine demand of treated water. A special point should be noticed for total amino acids: their contribution to the DOC values of treated water was only 2 to 7 %, but they may account for a larger proportion of BDOC or chlorine demand potential (5 to 25 %) ...|$|E
