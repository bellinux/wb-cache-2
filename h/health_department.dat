5|$|By 2000 the City of Portland {{had spent}} about $200million to nearly {{eliminate}} CSOs {{from entering the}} slough. It also replaced septic tank and cesspool systems near {{the middle and upper}} slough with sanitary sewers.

Despite these and other improvements in water quality, the slough is not a safe source of edible fish. The Multnomah County <b>Health</b> <b>Department</b> and other agencies have advised people to avoid or greatly reduce consumption of fish and crayfish from the slough because they contain polychlorinated biphenyls (PCB) and pesticides.|$|E
