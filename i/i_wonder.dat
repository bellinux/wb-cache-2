5|$|I can quite {{understand}} the Prince of Wales being much annoyed at his son's name being {{coupled with the}} thing {{but that was the}} case before I left it... we were both accused of going to this place but not together... they will end by having out in open court exactly what they are all trying to keep quiet. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if it is really a fact or only an invention of that arch ruffian H.|$|E
5|$|In 1973, Douglas {{attended}} a meeting addressing conservation of the Everglades in Everglades City, and was observed by John Rothchild: Mrs. Douglas was {{half the size}} of her fellow speakers and she wore huge dark glasses, which along with the huge floppy hat made her look like Scarlett O'Hara as played by Igor Stravinsky. When she spoke, everybody stopped slapping mosquitoes and more or less came to order. She reminded us all of our responsibility to nature and I don't remember what else. Her voice had the sobering effect of a one-room schoolmarm's. The tone itself seemed to tame the rowdiest of the local stone crabbers, plus the developers, and the lawyers on both sides. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if it didn't also intimidate the mosquitoes... The request for a Corps of Engineers permit was eventually turned down. This was no surprise to those of us who'd heard her speak.|$|E

25|$|Ian Chappell... made {{it clear}} more than once that he {{regarded}} the control of his side on the field as the concern solely of the umpires. Poor wretched men! <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what Ian thought might have happened if either Tom Brooks or Robin Bailhache had applied the full sanction of Law 46, and had banned either Lillee or Thomson on that emotion-charged Sunday afternoon. How many beer-cans might have bespattered the field, and angry spectators invaded the playing area? As it was the umpires contented themselves with friendly warnings afterwards described as 'unofficial'. In the circumstances {{it was hard to}} blame them.|$|E

Also, her first hit song in Indonesia, Aku Cinta Padamu {{was known as}} <b>I</b> <b>Wonder</b> when it was covered by North, an Australian boy band in their second album, Straight Up. This song also re-recorded in Chinese and Bahasa version by Lin, an Indonesian singer. Her song Cinta Tak Berganti from Prasasti Seni also re-recorded by the Dutch band After Touch.|$|E
500|$|He {{developed}} bronchial problems {{followed by}} double pneumonia. Louise was summoned on 28 April 1914, {{and he died}} on 2 May. Following his death, Louise had a nervous breakdown and suffered from intense loneliness, writing to a friend shortly afterwards: [...] "My loneliness without the Duke is quite terrible. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what he does now!" ...|$|E

6000|$|... “So very delightful, mamma,” {{the girl}} {{went on with}} her {{colourless}} calm. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> at it; it offered so strange a contrast to the mocking freedom of her tone the night before; but while <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>I</b> desired to testify to the interest at least with which she inspired me.|$|R

500|$|In 1926 Yeats {{spent several}} weeks in London, likely visiting Olivia frequently. He showed regret for his {{behaviour}} in 1897, writing to her, [...] "I came across two early photographs of you yesterday... Who {{ever had a}} like profile?—a profile from a Sicilian coin. One looks back to one's youth as to a cup that a mad man dying of thirst left half tasted. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{if you feel like}} that?"

500|$|Inspired by Archie Comics’ Afterlife with Archie, Del Col {{is quoted}} as saying, “So, then I started to think, 'Huh, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what other {{characters}} are {{out there that are}} well-known that could be rebooted like that,'" [...] Del Col said. [...] "That's when I started to look around and I looked in some properties, and then I thought, 'Wait a minute. Nancy Drew. Hardy Boys. Oh, that would be really cool to do a hard-boiled noir take on them.' ” ...|$|E
500|$|Davis {{was pleased}} with the episode; he stated [...] "For me the episode was terrific to play because they ended up making the Cigarette Smoking Man {{somewhat}} tougher. We have seen so much softness in him; it was great to play that tough side." [...] He described the scene in which he was strapped to an operating table with Mulder as [...] "totally uncomfortable". He joked that [...] "the only upside of that was that the author [...] was lying right beside me, feeling equally uncomfortable. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if David would have written it that way if he had known what he would have to go through." ...|$|E

500|$|According to Taylor's recollection, he {{was visiting}} McCartney {{at his home}} in St John's Wood, London, and asked the Beatle how he went about writing a song. In response, McCartney took Taylor into the dining room, where they both sat at a harmonium; McCartney then began playing the {{instrument}} and asked Taylor to call out the opposite to each word he happened to sing. Author Steve Turner writes of the result: [...] "And so it went – black and white, yes and no, stop and go, hello and goodbye." [...] Taylor later reflected: [...] "I've no memory at all of the tune... <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> whether Paul really made up [...] that song as he went along or whether it was running through his head already." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1963 Timmons' playing, with Lewis Powers on {{bass and}} Ron McCurdy on drums, was {{described}} by a Washington Post reviewer as [...] "flexible and adventuresome [...] Glossing over everything is an undeniable sheen of church music and spirituals." [...] In 1965 the same reviewer commented that Timmons was employing musicians who were of much lower ability: [...] "Timmons lacks a certain passion but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> {{if this is not}} the fault of his sidemen." [...] Timmons started playing vibes in the mid-1960s. He occasionally played organ, but recorded only one track on that instrument – a 1964 version of [...] "Moanin'" [...] on From the Bottom. Recordings as a leader continued, usually as part of a trio or quartet, but, after joining Milestone Records around 1967, Timmons' album Got to Get It! featured him as part of a nonet, playing arrangements by Tom McIntosh.|$|E
500|$|The duet of [...] "I Gotta Be Me" [...] by Finn and Mike was {{considered}} to be [...] "shockingly adorable" [...] by Berk, who gave it four stars out of five. Slezak was less impressed: [...] "The jazz band arrangement and the Mike-teaches-Finn-some-moves choreography was cute, I guess, but it's not a good sign that I spent half the number focusing on Mike's matching green t-shirt and shoe laces." [...] He went on to question the song's inclusion—"In an episode about confronting one's greatest teenage insecurities, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if {{there might have been a}} better choice for a solo than the popular football player with the cheerleader girlfriend lamenting his inability to dance"—and ultimately gave the performance a [...] "B−". Futterman also commented on the song's selection, though from a slightly different angle: [...] "In theory it's charming—and there are definitely moments of the 'I can dance/You can't dance' exchange that were enjoyable—but we couldn't ever imagine this song as something Finn would have voluntarily picked." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "So very much, mamma," [...] {{the young}} girl went on, {{with a sort of}} inscrutable submissiveness. <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> at it; it offered so strange a {{contrast}} to the mocking freedom of her tone the night before; but while <b>I</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>I</b> was careful not to let my perplexity take precedence of my good manners.|$|R

500|$|The {{polar group}} {{continued}} towards the Pole, passing Shackleton's Furthest South (88°23'S) on [...] Seven days later, about [...] from their goal, Amundsen's black flag was spotted {{and the party}} knew {{that they had been}} forestalled. They reached the Pole the next day, [...] 1912: [...] "The Pole. Yes, but under very different circumstances from those expected... Great God! This is an awful place and terrible enough for us to have laboured to it without the reward of priority. Well, it is something to have got here" [...] Scott still hoped to race Amundsen to the telegraph cablehead in Australia: [...] "Now for a desperate struggle to get the news through first. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if we can do it." [...] However, on 18 January 1912 they discovered Amundsen's tent, some supplies, a letter to King HaakonVII of Norway (which Amundsen politely asked Scott to deliver) and a note stating that Amundsen had arrived there with four companions on [...] 1911.|$|E
500|$|In August, the {{preparations}} extended to laying depots; an early party established a depot [...] {{to the south}} of the main hut—a grotto in the ice known as Aladdin's Cave—but returned without the dogs. Mertz and two others set off to rescue the dogs, but in heavy winds covered less than a mile in two hours, and returned to the hut. [...] "If it depended only on me," [...] Mertz wrote in his diary, after four days' more wind confined them to the hut, [...] "we would be in our sleeping bags outside in the snow, and we would at least try to find the dogs. Mawson is definitely too cautious, and <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if he would show enough gumption during the sledging expedition." [...] The following day Mertz was part of a party of three that made it to Aladdin's Cave to rescue the dogs; when strong winds confined them to the depot for three days they spent the time expanding the cave.|$|E
500|$|In September 2010, William Shatner {{commented on}} Twitter {{regarding}} {{damage to his}} star on the Walk of Fame: [...] "I hear my star on the Canadian Walk of Fame is a bit frazzled ... but, then again, so am I. <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if anybody hovering around that area can tell me what’s wrong with it and what needs fixing." [...] The family of Gordie Howe also commented on the damage to Gordie's star. The Canadian Press reported that [...] "A number of celebrities' stars are looking a bit rough around the edges." [...] The president of the Walk of Fame stated that damage {{was due to the}} freezing and thawing during Canadian winters and also sidewalk snowplows. It was announced that the city of Toronto would replace Shatner and Howe's damaged tiles, and the Walk of Fame was looking into an alternative to installing the plaques on a sidewalk where they are subjected to harsh environmental conditions.|$|E

500|$|After the Pixies {{broke up}} in 1993, Santiago {{had stayed in}} touch with every band member. In the summer of 2003, Black decided to begin reuniting the Pixies and called Santiago first. Santiago later explained: [...] "He called me on my {{cellphone}} and I was in Cape Cod visiting family. He said in this coy voice, 'Hey Joey, uh, you been hearin' these rumors that we're getting back together? Gee, <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> who started it?' I go, 'Charles, did you do that?' and he goes, 'Yeah.'" [...] Santiago then contacted Lovering and Deal to inform them of Black's decision and {{by the summer of}} 2004 the band had reunited. DreamWorks asked the Pixies in early 2004 to compose a song for the Shrek 2 soundtrack. They agreed, and early versions of this new song were recorded in Santiago's basement. With his soundtrack experience, the band, in the words of Deal, [...] "worked it up a bit in Joey's Pro Tools thing", before submitting it to the studio. DreamWorks rejected the song, so the band released it as a single, [...] "Bam Thwok".|$|E
500|$|Trumble {{was known}} for his cleverness on the field. C. B. Fry said of him, [...] "He is the most long-headed, observant and acute judge of the game, a perfect master of the whole art of placing fieldsmen and {{changing}} bowlers." [...] On one occasion when captaining his state side, Victoria, he deliberately bowled two wides that his fieldsmen allowed to roll to the boundary to score four runs for his opponents. This was done to save his tired bowlers from having to bowl again immediately, as his opponents would have been required to follow-on (bat twice in a row), at the time compulsory. When questioned by an onlooker about the dubious sportsmanship of the action, he replied, [...] "I had to do it, old chap, but <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> what my father will think of it?" [...] Trumble was respected by his teammates and opponents; New Zealand cricketer, Dan Reese, who played against and alongside Trumble said, [...] "His subtle humour, his fund of cricket stories, his kindness, and, above all, his judgment, made him a man of exceptional character." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Venus" [...] is a synthpop and dance-pop song {{consisting}} of four hooks. The structure and Gaga's vocal delivery {{are similar to}} that of singer David Bowie in his persona Ziggy Stardust, as well as Bananarama's 1986 single of the same name. Along with the Bowie-esque verses, there's one hook where the beat drops, then another hook where it starts building up, and finally the chorus is reached. When Bradley Stern from MuuMuse reviewed the single, he described the chorus as [...] "total pop euphoria" [...] with Gaga belting the lyrics, [...] "When you touch me I die just a little inside / <b>I</b> <b>wonder</b> if this could be love!" [...] The song is written in the key of F minor and composed in the time signature of common time, with a tempo of 122 beats per minute. Gaga's vocals range from F3 to E5, and the track follows a basic sequence of Em–D–Em–D in the first verse, G–D–Em–D in the second hook, Em–A–Em–A in the third verse, and finally Em–G–D–C in the chorus.|$|E
