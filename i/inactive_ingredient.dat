5000|$|In August 2009 the United States Food and Drug Administration advised {{pharmaceutical}} manufacturers {{that they}} should determine if they are using components possibly contaminated with melamine and test those components at risk, as well as make sure they get certifications from suppliers that at-risk components have been tested appropriately.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Direct human {{emissions}} {{are known to}} contribute volatile organic com-pounds (VOCs) to indoor air via various mechanisms. However, few measurements that determine the emissions of a full suite of occupant-associated VOCs are available. We measured occupant-related VOC emissions from engineering students in a classroom using a proton-transfer-reaction time-of-flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF-MS). The dominant compound emitted was a cyclic volatile methylsiloxane (cVMS), decamethylcyclopentasiloxane (D 5), which is a major <b>inactive</b> <b>ingredient</b> in some personal care products such as antiperspirants. D 5 was found to contribute ∼ 30 % of the total indoor VOC mass concentration {{as measured by the}} PTR-TOF-MS. Octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane (D 4) and dodecamethylcyclohexasiloxane (D 6) were detected at abundances that were 1 − 2 orders of magnitude lower. The per-person emission rate of these three cVMS declined monotonically from morning into the afternoon, consistent with expectations for emissions from daily morning application of personal care products...|$|E
40|$|AbstractRespiratory {{pharmaceutical}} products {{are among the}} most commonly used products in the hospital setting. However the halal status of these products is unknown and has never been investigated before. The objective {{of this study is to}} assess the status of these products at a hospital. Halal assessment was based on academic and other websites references. From 132 respiratory products that have been investigated, 11. 4 % are halal followed by 6. 1 % of them haram, 10. 6 % mushbooh and 72. 0 % are not known in terms of their halal status. All the haram medications are related to the presence of ethanol as the <b>inactive</b> <b>ingredient.</b> No information of inactive ingredients in medication leaflets is the most contributive factor leading to unknown halal status of the medications. In conclusion, cooperation between the government, pharmaceutical manufacturers, religious scholars and health care professionals is suggested in order to achieve a goal towards using halal medications...|$|E
40|$|Approximately 75 % of new {{molecular}} entities {{approved by}} the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) {{for use in the}} pharmaceutical industry are found to have poor aqueous solubility. This undesirable attribute leads to consequences such as higher doses required to reach therapeutic levels, greater vulnerability to food effects, lesser fraction absorbed in the small intestine and damage to the environment due to increased quantity of excretion. The addition of an excipient (i. e. a FDA approved <b>inactive</b> <b>ingredient)</b> to the molecular structure of an active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) through intermolecular bonding is of growing interest because the properties of the API can be tuned without further clinical testing. Crystal engineering utilizes the knowledge of intermolecular interactions to design new solids with improved properties (e. g. solubility, stability, bioavailability, dissolution rates). In this thesis, these techniques are applied to increase the solubility of three APIs with low solubility: esomeprazole magnesium, curcumin and rufinamide. Through an intense screening process, novel solid states were discovered including a water/butanol solvate of esomeprazole magnesium and a co-amorphous mixture comprised of curcumin and folic acid dihydrate. The co-amorphous mixture was found to have increased dissolution rate compared to curcumin and can be repositioned as a prenatal drug. Characterization of these products include powder and single crystal X-ray diffraction, differential scanning calorimetry, thermogravimetric analysis, Fourier Transform infrared spectroscopy, solution nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy and dynamic vapour sorption. Screening of rufinamide did not lead to the discovery of any new forms, but the refined molecular structure of the metastable form is reported...|$|E
