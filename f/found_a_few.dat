5|$|Japanese website ITmedia {{reviewed}} the beta version in September 2004. The reviewer enjoyed the experience overall and found communication with other players easy, but <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> faults {{with the game}} that they hoped would be resolved later, and generally found the female characters less effective in battle. During its first day of operation, the game registered 200,000 users, making it the best-selling mobile game up until that time, and was accessed 1.6 million times. According to Ito, by 2006, the game was still highly popular in Japan.|$|E
5|$|Not all {{software}} {{states are}} vulnerable to rowhammer attacks. An attacker thus needs to find right target states in order to utilize rowhammer errors. In practice, {{one of the main}} challenges is in identifying target states. Such typically have been done by domain experts. The mainstream fault tolerance community responded to rowhammer attacks with a systematic methodology which can be used to identify, validate, and evaluate rowhammer attack target states and their exploitability. That work is based on the well-established fault injection-based experimental methodology, and generalized attack target states and <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> practical target states that were previously unknown.|$|E
5|$|The soundtrack {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics; while several {{felt that the}} music was good and keeping in tone with the game, others {{found it to be}} odd and shallow. Several reviewers attributed the change to the lack of participation by Uematsu. Final Fantasy X-2 International + Last Mission Original Soundtrack and Final Fantasy X-2 Piano Collection, on the other hand, were very well received by critics, who felt that they were far superior to the original soundtrack. The singles for the soundtrack were poorly received by critics, who <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> of the songs to be enjoyable but all of the singles to be overpriced.|$|E

5|$|Heinrich Mallison from Berlin's Museum of Natural History also {{presented}} a theory in 2011, suggesting that Tyrannosaurus {{and many other}} dinosaurs may have achieved relatively high speeds through short rapid strides instead of the long strides employed by modern birds and mammals when running, likening their movement to power-walking. This, according to Mallison, would have been achievable irrespective of joint strength and lessened {{the need for additional}} muscle mass in the legs, particularly at the ankles. To support his theory, Mallison assessed the limbs of various dinosaurs and found that they were different from those of modern mammals and birds; having their stride length greatly limited by their skeletons, but also having relatively large muscles at the hindquarters. He <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>few</b> similarities between the muscles in dinosaurs and race-walkers; having less muscle mass in the ankles but more at the hindquarters. John Hutchinson advised caution regarding this theory, suggesting that they must first look into dinosaur muscles to see how frequently they could have contracted.|$|E
