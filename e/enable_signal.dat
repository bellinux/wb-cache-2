2500|$|Some devices {{require an}} {{additional}} flow control signal from slave to master, indicating when data is ready. This {{leads to a}} 5-wire protocol {{instead of the usual}} 4. Such a ready or <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> is often active-low, and needs to be enabled at key points such as after commands or between words. Without such a signal, data transfer rates may need to be slowed down significantly, or protocols may need to have dummy bytes inserted, to accommodate the worst case for the slave response time. Examples include initiating an ADC conversion, addressing the right page of flash memory, and processing enough of a command that device firmware can load the first word of the response. (Many SPI masters do not support that signal directly, and instead rely on fixed delays.) ...|$|E
5000|$|A {{transparent}} latch is basically {{one bit of}} memory which is updated when an <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> is raised. Again, {{there are many other}} ways this can be expressed in VHDL.-- latch template 1:Q <= D when Enable = '1' else Q;-- latch template 2:process(D,Enable)begin if Enable = '1' then Q <= D; end if;end process; ...|$|E
5000|$|This latch {{exploits}} {{the fact}} that, {{in the two}} active input combinations (01 and 10) of a gated SR latch, R is the complement of S. The input NAND stage converts the two D input states (0 and 1) to these two input combinations for the next [...] latch by inverting the data input signal. The low state of the <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> produces the inactive [...] "11" [...] combination. Thus a gated D-latch may {{be considered as a}} one-input synchronous SR latch. This configuration prevents application of the restricted input combination. It is also known as transparent latch, data latch, or simply gated latch. It has a data input and an <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> (sometimes named clock, or control). The word transparent comes from the fact that, when the enable input is on, the signal propagates directly through the circuit, from the input D to the output Q.|$|E
30|$|The image {{receiver}} unit uses the 8 -bit original image data, data <b>enabling</b> <b>signal,</b> and synchronic clock as input; the output are the 1 -bit edge image data, data <b>enabling</b> <b>signal,</b> and synchronic clock.|$|R

50|$|The {{transmit}} clock is a free-running clock {{generated by the}} PHY based on the link speed (25 MHz for 100 Mbit/s, 2.5 MHz for 10 Mbit/s). The remaining transmit signals are driven by the MAC synchronously on the rising edge of TX_CLK. This arrangement allows the MAC to operate without having {{to be aware of}} the link speed. The transmit <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> is held high during frame transmission and low when the transmitter is idle.|$|E
5000|$|Latches are {{designed}} to be transparent. That is, input signal changes cause immediate changes in output. Additional logic can be added to a simple transparent latch to make it non-transparent or opaque when another input (an [...] "enable" [...] input) is not asserted. When several transparent latches follow each other, using the same <b>enable</b> <b>signal,</b> signals can propagate through all of them at once. However, by following a transparent-high latch with a transparent-low (or opaque-high) latch, a master-slave flip-flop is implemented.|$|E
50|$|The FPD-Link data {{transmission}} scheme serializes seven single-ended data bits per clock cycle {{into each of}} the LVDS channels. Therefore, the LVDS bit rate is 7 times {{the frequency of the}} clock signal. For example, in the 18-bit RGB application, there are 6 bits each for R, G, and B and an additional 3 bits for horizontal and vertical synch and an <b>enable</b> <b>signal.</b> This means there are 21 total data signals in each clock cycle, which means the 7 to 1 serialization reduces this down to 3 data channels. Then if the clock signal is 50 MHz the LVDS streaming video data rate will be 350 Mbit/s per channel, and the total data transfer rate will be 1,050 Mbit/s over the 3 channels.|$|E

5000|$|Page mode DRAM {{is a minor}} {{modification}} to the first-generation DRAM IC interface which {{improved the}} performance of reads and writes to a row by avoiding the inefficiency of precharging and opening the same row repeatedly to access a different column. In Page mode DRAM, after a row was opened by holding [...] low, the row could be kept open, and multiple reads or writes could be performed {{to any of the}} columns in the row. Each column access was initiated by asserting [...] and presenting a column address. For reads, after a delay (tCAC), valid data would appear on the data out pins, which were held at high-Z before the appearance of valid data. For writes, the write <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> and write data would be presented along with the column address.|$|E
40|$|A novel scan-based delay test approach, {{referred}} as the hybrid delay scan, is proposed in this paper. The proposed scan-based delay testing method combines {{advantages of the}} skewed-load and broad-side approaches. Unlike the skewed-load approach whose design requirement is often too costly to meet due to the fast switching scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal,</b> the hybrid delay scan {{does not require a}} strong buffer or buffer tree to drive the fast switching scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal.</b> Hardware overhead added to standard scan designs to implement the hybrid approach is negligible. Since the fast scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal</b> is internally generated, no external pin is required. Transition delay fault coverage achieved by the hybrid approach is equal to or higher than that achieved by the broad-side load for all ISCAS 89 benchmark circuits. On an average, about 4. 5 % improvement in fault coverage is obtained by the hybrid approach over the broad-side approach. 1...|$|E

40|$|Retiming is an {{efficient}} technique for redistributing reg-isters in synchronous circuits {{in order to}} improve the circuit performance.

40|$|With todayâ€™s {{design size}} in {{millions}} of gates and working frequency in gigahertz range, at-speed test is crucial. The launchoff-shift method has several advantages over the launch-offcapture but imposes strict requirements on transition fault testing due to at-speed scan <b>enable</b> <b>signal.</b> A novel scan-based atspeed test is proposed which generates multiple local fast scan enable signals.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a hybrid scan-based transition delay fault test. The proposed technique controls a small subset of scan cells by launch-off-shift method {{and the rest}} by launch-off-capture method. An efficient ATPG-based controllability measurement approach is proposed to select the scan cells {{to be controlled by}} launch-off-shift or launch-off-capture. In this technique, local scan <b>enable</b> <b>signals</b> are generated on-chip using two local scan enable generator cells. The cells can be inserted anywhere in a scan chain and the area overhead is negligible. The launch and capture information of scan <b>enable</b> <b>signals</b> are transferred into the scan chain during scan-in process.

30|$|IR {{does not}} always provide an output signal via catalysis. Under certain conditions, signals from IR are {{transmitted}} by changes in its interaction status with its binding partners.
