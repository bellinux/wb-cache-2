500|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{controversy}} broke, Lennon reluctantly apologised for the comment, saying [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> television was {{more popular than}} Jesus, I might have got away with it". He stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. The events contributed to the Beatles' {{lack of interest in}} public live performances, and the US tour was the last they undertook, after which they became a studio-only band.|$|E
500|$|Anna Rosmus {{received}} the 1994 award, {{in honor of}} work related to her research on the Nazi past of her hometown in Bavaria. [...] Rosmus researched anti-Semitism, and opposed neo-Nazis and the extreme right in Germany. [...] She also located and published artwork of Jews that had once lived {{in her hometown of}} Passau, Germany. [...] As a result of her work, Rosmus endured threats against her life. In a 1996 Yom HaShoah ceremony, Rosmus recounted threats she faced after conducting her research: [...] "Once-friendly neighbors threatened me openly - on the telephone, in person, in letters ... They threatened to kill me and kidnap my children. Some even attacked me physically, a room where I was to speak in Munich was bombed just before I was to be there, and several times I was sued. Nobody ever claimed <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> anything false or made mistakes. They just claimed all this would damage their reputations." [...] Rosmus was profiled on 60 Minutes, and her story was the subject of the 1990 West German drama film, The Nasty Girl. Rosmus was presented with the Conscience-in-Media Award in a special ceremony at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum.|$|E
500|$|The Beatles {{left for}} their US tour on 11 August 1966. According to Lennon's wife, Cynthia, {{he was nervous}} and upset {{that he had made}} people angry simply by expressing his opinion. The Beatles {{attended}} a press conference in Chicago, Illinois; Lennon did not want to apologise but was advised by Epstein and Barrow that he should. Lennon said that [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> television was more popular than Jesus, I might have got away with it" [...] but stressed that he was simply remarking on how other people viewed and popularised the band. He described his own belief in God by quoting the Bishop of Woolwich, saying, [...] "not as an old man in the sky. I believe that what people call God is something in all of us." [...] Adamant that he was not comparing himself with Christ, he tried to explain the decline of Christianity in the UK. Pressed for an apology by a reporter, he said: [...] "if you want me to apologise, if that will make you happy, then OK, I'm sorry." [...] Journalists gave a sympathetic response, and told Lennon that the Bible Belt were [...] "quite notorious for their Christian attitude".|$|E

[...] "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to yourself, {{and not to}} others; {{and what}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> in answer to {{questions}} asked by yourself." [...] Then the Doctor apologised with what grace he could. But {{when he left the}} house his heart was still bitter against Mr. Puddicombe.|$|R

2500|$|Monica's career {{came to a}} {{slow down}} in 1999 due to {{relationship}} problems with her ex-boyfriend Jarvis Weems. In July 2000, the couple were together at the gravesite of Weems's brother, {{who had died in}} an automobile accident at age 25 in 1998, when Weems, without warning, put a gun to his head and committed suicide. [...] "Afterward, I felt, 'What else could I have done?' You replay that situation over and over and you switch it around: Maybe if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> this, or if I would have done that,'" [...] {{she said in an interview}} with The Cincinnati Enquirer the following year. [...] "It's just something that it's never possible for me to go back and change." ...|$|E
2500|$|In November 2006, 500 {{supporters}} including {{world champion}} boxers Koichi Wajima and Katsuo Tokashiki submitted {{letters to the}} Supreme Court asking for a retrial. [...] In March 2007, Norimichi Kumamoto, {{one of the three}} judges who had originally convicted Hakamada, came out in support of Hakamada's innocence. He stated that he had doubted the authenticity of the confession and believed Hakamada to be innocent. However, he had failed to persuade his two more senior colleagues, resulting in the split judgment for conviction. [...] He eventually resigned his position out of guilt for the conviction. The revelation came in spite of a strong tradition against revealing the discussions between judges, and it resulted in Kumamoto being highly criticized. [...] "Iâ€™m glad I spoke up," [...] he said. [...] "I wish <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> it earlier, and maybe something might have changed." [...] He tried to visit Hakamada in prison to apologize personally, but his request was denied.|$|E

2500|$|By early 1838, Smith and Cowdery {{disagreed}} {{on three}} significant issues. First, Cowdery competed with Smith for {{leadership of the}} new church and [...] "disagreed with the Prophet's economic and political program and sought a personal financial independence [...] Zion society that Joseph Smith envisioned." [...] Then too, in March 1838, Smith and Rigdon moved to Far West, which had been under the presidency of W. W. Phelps and Cowdery's brothers-in-law, David and John Whitmer. There Smith and Rigdon {{took charge of the}} Missouri church and initiated policies that Cowdery, Phelps, and the Whitmers believed violated {{the separation of church and}} state. Finally, in January 1838, Cowdery wrote his brother Warren that he and Smith [...] "had some conversation in which in every instance I did not fail to affirm that which <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> was strictly true. A dirty, nasty, filthy affair of his and Fanny Alger's was talked over in which I strictly declared that I had never deserted from the truth in the matter, and as I supposed was admitted by himself." [...] Alger, a teenage maid living with the Smiths, may have been Smith's first plural wife, a practice that Cowdery opposed.|$|E

60|$|Now, I don't want to {{sit down}} just in this way. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> been talking with so much levity that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> no serious thing, and you are really no better or wiser, {{although}} Robert Buchanan <b>has</b> suggested that <b>I</b> am a person who deals in wisdom. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> nothing which would make you better than when you came here.|$|R
6000|$|... "What <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>said</b> to his face. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> made no {{accusation}} against him.

60|$|This manner jolted me. I {{was down}} at the foot again, in a moment. But I had to say just what <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>said</b> before.|$|E
