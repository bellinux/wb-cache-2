You made the music come to life." [...] Brown's part of the song is the chorus, where he described the grief of Jackson's death and noting that [...] "I know it's better on the other side." [...] On The Game's verses he reflects on Jackson's influence on him growing up and comparing himself to Jackson. [...] Towards the ending on the song The Game claims that the feud between him and 50 Cent is over, presumably due to Jackson's death, [...] "First thing I did when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>was</b> I called Puff.
