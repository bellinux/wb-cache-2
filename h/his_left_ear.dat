5|$|After the altercation with Gauguin, Van Gogh {{returned}} to his room, where he was assaulted by voices and severed <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> with a razor (either wholly or in part; accounts differ), causing severe bleeding. He bandaged the wound, wrapped the ear in paper, and delivered the package to a woman at a brothel Van Gogh and Gauguin both frequented. Van Gogh was found unconscious the next morning by a policeman and taken to hospital, where Félix Rey, a young doctor still in training, treated him. The ear was delivered to the hospital, but Rey {{did not attempt to}} reattach it as too much time had passed.|$|E

25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the 23 December 1888 breakdown that resulted in the self-mutilation of <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear,</b> Van Gogh voluntarily admitted himself to the Saint-Paul-de-Mausole lunatic asylum on 8 May 1889. Housed in a former monastery, Saint-Paul-de-Mausole catered to the wealthy and was less than half full when Van Gogh arrived, allowing him to occupy not only a second-story bedroom but also a ground-floor room for use as a painting studio.|$|E

At the time, Han Pil-ho (한필호; 韓弼昊), a member of Sinminhoe, was killed, Shin Suk-choong (신석충; 申錫忠) killed himself, and An tried to commit suicide during the severe interrogation but failed. Kim also tried to kill himself with a self-inflicted injury in his head, but failed.|$|E
25|$|Hanson {{was born}} in the Sydney suburb of Burwood on 23 November 1913, the {{youngest}} of five children to Australian-born railroad engineer William Hanson, and his English-born wife Lilian, née Bennett. The marriage broke up when Hanson was quite young. Hanson was sickly as a child, suffering from bronchial complaints and a recurring ear infection that left him almost deaf in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear.</b> He began experimenting in musical composition from the age of eight, inspired by his older sister's piano practice. Hanson's mother brought him up as a Baptist, and though he later left the faith he retained a lifelong interest in spirituality.|$|E
25|$|During the {{afternoon}} {{session of the}} Sheffield Shield match between South Australia and New South Wales at the Sydney Cricket Ground on 25 November 2014, Hughes, batting at 63 not out, was struck in the neck by the ball after missing an attempted hook shot to a bouncer from New South Wales bowler Sean Abbott. Hughes was wearing a helmet, but the ball struck an unprotected area just below <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear.</b> He collapsed before receiving mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and was subsequently taken to St Vincent's Hospital, Sydney, where he underwent surgery and was placed into an induced coma. Hughes' injury was a rare but described type of sport-related blunt-force cerebrovascular injury called a vertebral artery dissection which led to subarachnoid haemorrhage.|$|E
60|$|Peter Rabbit stared {{and stared}} at the tracks in the soft mud of the swamp in the Old Pasture. He would look first at the tracks, then at his own feet, and finally back at the tracks again. He {{scratched}} his long right ear with his long right hind foot. Then he scratched <b>his</b> long <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> with <b>his</b> long <b>left</b> hind foot, all the time staring his hardest at those strange tracks. They certainly were the tracks of a Rabbit, and it was equally certain that they were not his own.|$|R

5000|$|... : These two {{appear to}} be a pair of street {{performers}} at first, who have pierced ears. The older brother, who seems to do all the talking, has <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ears</b> pierced, and is missing most of his right hand which has turned to stone, while the younger brother, who solely seems to play with a soccer ball that has a zipper in it, has his right ears pierced and never speaks. These two try to track down Karera for reasons relating to the Rokakaka tree. They also seem to know Josefumi Kujo, as they are surprised at how Soft & Wet's abilities are similar to his. They fight both Josuke and Karera, and Josuke appears to be outnumbered until Karera returns after being set on fire by their original attack. Josuke manages to steal the poison gas within the soccer ball, stopping their combination attack, and then Karera uses Love Love Deluxe to grow hair around them to set on fire. While they are distracted by the flames, Josuke unleashes the poison he stole earlier, killing both of them and reducing them to rubble.|$|R
25|$|After the {{operation}} MGR's voice changed. Since {{he had been}} shot in his ear MGR lost hearing in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> and had ringing in the ear problems. These further surfaced in 1983 when he had kidney problems. When Sinnappa Devar paid his first visit to see MGR at the hospital after the shooting incident he paid MGR an advance for the next MGR's movie. After getting released from the hospital and finishing Arasakattalai MGR acted in Devar's movie Vivasaayee against doctors' advice. Due to {{the operation}}, MGR's speaking parts in the movie Kaavalkaaran were reduced. This was the only movie MGR spoke with old and new voices between scenes: MGR was acting in the film Kaavalkaran in 1967 opposite J. Jayalalithaa when the shooting occurred.|$|E
25|$|Mamoru {{struggles with}} his {{identity}} and function throughout the series, worrying first about his true nature, then later whether {{he gets in}} the way of the Sailor Soldiers. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa's), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series. Mamoru also has <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> pierced in the manga, a trait that does not carry over to his anime counterpart.|$|E
25|$|Zamasu is a green-skinned {{humanoid}} with grey {{eyes and}} a white Mohawk. He is seen wearing a violet long-sleeved shirt under a gray coat with yellow trimming, itself under a light blue sash. He also wears dark blue pants and white boots. The Zamasu who stole Goku's body originally had an appearance identical to his counterparts. He gains Goku's appearance after switching bodies with him, the only physical differences being a slightly darker skin tone and sterner eyes, along with a somewhat skinnier physique after the switch. His attire consists of a sleeveless dark grey uwagi, a long-sleeved black undershirt with a turtleneck, a red sash, black pants and white boots. He wears a single gold and green Universe 10 Supreme Kai Potara earring on <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear.</b> He also wears a Time Ring on his right index finger, that he uses to travel through time without the need of a time machine. After attaining his Super Saiyan Rosé transformation, his hair rises upward and turns bright pink.|$|E
50|$|Alex Brandtner replaces Moser as team leader. Following Moser's death, Rex {{has become}} {{depressed}} {{and refuses to}} eat, wanting to stay near Moser's house all the time. However, Brandtner succeeds in helping Rex out of his depression. Brandtner had lost his former dog, Arko, in a bomb explosion, while also injuring <b>his</b> own <b>left</b> <b>ear,</b> and {{does not want to}} work with dogs again, until he meets Rex. The explosion has also robbed him of his hearing in his right ear, a fact he confides only to Rex. Brandtner moves into the house that Moser and Rex used to share, apparently because Rex does not want to leave.|$|R
5|$|Van Gogh {{suffered}} from psychotic episodes and delusions {{and though he}} worried about his mental stability, he often neglected his physical health, did not eat properly and drank heavily. His friendship with Gauguin ended after a confrontation with a razor, when in a rage, he severed part of <b>his</b> own <b>left</b> <b>ear.</b> He spent time in psychiatric hospitals, including a period at Saint-Rémy. After he discharged himself {{and moved to the}} Auberge Ravoux in Auvers-sur-Oise near Paris, he came under the care of the homoeopathic doctor Paul Gachet. His depression continued and on 27 July 1890, Van Gogh shot himself in the chest with a revolver. He died from his injuries two days later.|$|R
5000|$|The {{labor is}} so difficult, his mother threatens to {{castrate}} his father, Lord Grandgousier. The giant Gargantua emerges at <b>his</b> mother's <b>left</b> <b>ear,</b> calling for ale, while 17,913 cows were {{required for the}} provision of his daily milk. His first garment featured a codpiece whose [...] "exiture, outjecting or outstanding ... was of the length of a yard", its contents providing so much delight that his three nurses squabble over claims to it. After some indifferent education at home, he is sent to Paris where the crowds so annoy him that he drowns thousands of them in a flood of urine (the survivors laugh so much, the city is renamed [...] "Par Ris").|$|R
500|$|Australian cricketer Phillip Hughes died on 27 November 2014 after {{developing}} a vertebral artery dissection {{as a result}} of being struck {{on the side of the}} neck by a cricket ball during a Sheffield Shield match on 25 November 2014.

Lincoln slumped over in his chair and then fell backward. Rathbone turned to see Booth standing in gunsmoke less than four feet behind Lincoln; Booth shouted a word that Rathbone thought sounded like [...] "Freedom!" ...|$|E
500|$|On 7 March 2016, {{the band}} {{announced}} that the final ten dates of the Rock or Bust World Tour would be rescheduled as Johnson's doctors had ordered him to stop touring immediately, as his hearing loss had accelerated and he risked complete deafness if he persisted on the road. The ten cancelled dates would be performed [...] "likely with a guest vocalist" [...] later in the year, leaving Johnson's future in touring with the group uncertain. Johnson himself later stated on The Howard Stern Show that his hearing loss didn't come from having performed for 36 years with AC/DC, but rather his love of auto racing and having forgotten to put ear plugs in during one race {{left him with a}} ruptured ear drum in <b>his</b> <b>left</b> <b>ear.</b>|$|E
5000|$|He let the dog go and it sprang at {{the monkey}} like a tiger. The monkey was amazingly nimble, jumped {{about three feet}} {{high in the air}} and when it came down landed {{directly}} on the dog's back, bit firmly in the dog's neck, grabbed <b>his</b> opponent's <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> with <b>his</b> hand thereby preventing the dog from turning his head to bite him. In this totally surprising situation the monkey now began to work over the dog's head with his club and he pounded so forcefully and relentlessly on the dog's skull that the poor creature cried out loudly. In short, the skull was soon cracked and the dead dog was carried from the ring. Yet, the monkey was only of medium size." ...|$|R
50|$|Marduk is {{depicted}} as a 2.14 m, muscular, bald man (age 28 in Tekken 4). He wears green and purple shorts with logos on them, green kneepads with name on them, and purple and green gloves. He also has purple and green necklace and mixed-coloured tattoo on his arm, although from Tekken 5 and onwards the tattoo becomes black. His Player 2 costume consists of a dark brown vest with logos on them, brown leather trousers, brown shoes, and black shoulder-length hair. In later games, he no longer has hair and gains black gloves and sunglasses. Marduk holds great similarity to real-life pro wrestlers, Bill Goldberg and Nathan Jones. Jones and Marduk {{are about the same}} size, Australian, served prison time, and are often portrayed as crude muscle-heads. <b>His</b> injured <b>left</b> <b>ear</b> is believed to be a reference to the Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield fight where Tyson bit Holyfield's ear.|$|R
60|$|Bullets {{were now}} flying in all directions, {{and both sides}} were making their shots tell. The Americans had but scant protection, {{and it was not}} long before a number of them fell. Some bullets came close to Theodore Roosevelt, and one hit a palm tree near where he was standing, filling <b>his</b> <b>left</b> eye and <b>ear</b> with the dust and splinters. Had that Mauser bullet come a few inches closer, the man who was destined to become the future President of our country might have been killed on the spot.|$|R
