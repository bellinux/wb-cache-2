5|$|Namaka is only 1.5% {{as bright}} as its parent dwarf planet Haumea and is about 0.05% its mass. If <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> have a similar albedo, it would be about 170km in diameter. Photometric {{observations}} indicate that its surface is made of water ice.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main {{reason is that the}} gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it proves to be fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E

Not long after, however, Ann confides in Leslie that she wants to break up with Mark, citing that he is simply not the one.

Andy is forced to kick Joe out of the studio when he actually arrives to bring April to his van.|$|E
5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} on the port side, but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, and <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be zero.|$|E
5|$|The series—presented {{as if it}} were a real documentary—depicts the {{everyday}} lives of office employees in the Scranton, Pennsylvania, branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company.

Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) holds a sex education meeting in the office hoping to learn if Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) is having sex with her boyfriend, Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods).|$|E

5|$|Azar and {{a healer}} provide {{alternative}} treatment for Waterston, who fully recovers. He announces {{that he still}} wants a relationship with Scully, but she realizes {{she is no longer}} the same person she was those many years ago and rejects him. As she sits outside the hospital on a bench, Scully thinks that she sees the mysterious woman again, but <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be Mulder. Later, the two agents sit in Mulder's apartment talking about {{the events of the last}} few days. Mulder begins to speak more existentially about what transpired, implying that fate has brought them together but, when he turns to look at Scully, he sees that she has fallen asleep.|$|E
5|$|The episode {{opens with}} Lewis (Clark Johnson) and Crosetti (Jon Polito) {{looking for a}} {{projectile}} {{a few yards away}} from the body of a man shot to death. The man's girlfriend (Oni Faida Lampley), who {{was shot in the head}} during the incident but survived, tells police during questioning that her aunt Calpurnia Church hired a hitman to kill her for insurance money. The detectives learn Church previously collected life insurance from five deceased husbands. Suspecting Church of murdering her husbands, Lewis and Crosetti have the body of her most recent husband exhumed for an autopsy, but reach a dead-end when <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be the wrong body in his grave.|$|E
5|$|The halogens darken in colour as {{the group}} is descended: {{fluorine}} is a very pale yellow gas, chlorine is greenish-yellow, and bromine is a reddish-brown volatile liquid. Iodine conforms to the prevailing trend, being a shiny black crystalline solid that melts at 114°C and boils at 183°C to form a violet gas. This trend occurs because the wavelengths of visible light absorbed by the halogens increase down the group (though astatine may not conform to it, depending on how metallic <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be). Specifically, the violet colour of iodine gas results from the electron transition between the highest occupied antibonding πg molecular orbital and the lowest vacant antibonding σu molecular orbital.|$|E

5|$|Before he {{can leave}} the capital, Littlefinger offers to take Ned to the last person Jon Arryn spoke to before his death. <b>It</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a prostitute, Mhaegan, {{the mother of a}} baby daughter, who is another of Robert's illegitimate children. Littlefinger reveals Jon Arryn had been searching for Robert's bastards for an unknown reason. When Ned and his guards try to leave, they are ambushed by Jaime Lannister and his men, who want answers for Tyrion's arrest. Ned claims {{responsibility}} for Tyrion's arrest, which leads to a brutal fight between his and Jaime's men. In the end, Ned's guards are killed, including his captain Jory Cassel, whom Jaime stabs through the eye with a dagger. Ned duels with Jaime but is speared through the leg by one of Jaime's guards before Stark and Lannister can finish the fight on their own. Jaime knocks out the guard who interrupted the fight and decides to let Ned live but warns that he wants his brother back. Jaime storms away, leaving Ned bleeding in the dirt, where he quickly faints.|$|E
5|$|In a subplot, Bart and Lisa {{stay at the}} Springfield Retirement Castle with Grandpa, {{and they}} {{discover}} a metal detector in his closet. While Bart uses it to look for pirate treasure, they uncover an alternate ending to Casablanca. After playing the scene on a projector screen <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a very sanitized and typical Hollywood happy end, where Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman marry in the end. Bart, Lisa and Granpa all like it {{but one of the}} spectators, The Old Jewish Man, reveals that he was once a studio executive and actually tried to include this happy ending to the film. Ashamed and disgruntled, he pays Bart and Lisa to re-bury the film reel, giving them another film reel to bury along with it, titled It's A Wonderful Life (Killing Spree Ending).|$|E
5|$|The second plot of {{the episode}} {{revolves}} around Jerry; when he prepares {{to go to the}} laundromat, Kramer asks him to take his laundry with him. Jerry agrees after some reluctance, insisting that their clothes remain segregated. After retrieving the laundry the following day and returning Kramer's portion, Jerry remembers that he had hidden a large sum of money in his laundry bag, but is unable to find it. The owner of the laundromat (John Capodice), tells him that he did not see the money, but also points out that he is not responsible for valuables. Kramer and Jerry both assume Vic stole the money and Kramer comes {{up with a plan to}} put cement mix in one of Vic's washing machines as revenge. Once they have acted out the plan, Kramer discovers that he had the money all along; and <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be just enough to cover the damage to the washing machine.|$|E

5|$|Ash soon {{comes to}} realize that the Pikachu refuses to go inside his Poké Ball and prefers his independence. As Ash carries the {{reluctant}} Pikachu, he hopes that they can be friends, but Pikachu acts aloof and openly shows his distrust of Ash. Just then, the two stumble upon a Pidgey in the wild and Ash unsuccessfully tries to catch it by throwing a Poké Ball. Ash uses his Pokédex and finds out that in order to catch a Pokémon, a trainer must first use their Pokémon to battle it, thereby weakening it, to be caught by a Poké Ball. With Pikachu being uncooperative, Ash tries to fight the Pidgey himself, but is easily beaten, which greatly amuses Pikachu. The Pidgey escapes and Ash finds a Rattata rummaging through his pack. He chases the Pokémon off as he hears cooing behind him. He turns to see several Pidgey gathered in the tall grass. Frustrated, Ash throws a rock at what he believes is the Pidgey. However, <b>it</b> <b>turns</b> <b>out</b> <b>to</b> be a Spearow, which starts attacking Pikachu and Ash. Pikachu shocks Spearow, and in the process alerts a whole flock. The angered Spearow flock gives chase and eventually catches up and attacks Pikachu. Ash quickly grabs Pikachu and dives down a waterfall in order to escape from the flock of Spearow, and the two are fished out down river by a young girl named Misty, who tells Ash to take the injured Pikachu to the Pokémon Center in Viridian City. Seeing the Spearow flock approaching, Ash escapes with Pikachu taking Misty's bike.|$|E
