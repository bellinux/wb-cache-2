40|$|The {{research}} project {{was focused on}} the improvement of recovered paper processing by flotation deinking for ink removal from deinked pulp. In an integral consideration the challenges of recycling of <b>graphic</b> <b>paper</b> products were defined in eight sub-projects, covering all relevant process steps of recycling (paper recovery, recovered paper processing, paper production, paper converting). Beside logistic problems in the recovery of office papers, different technological aspects of processing <b>graphic</b> <b>paper</b> products were evaluated and improved. Additionally, recovered paper processing in industrial operation was optimized. The obtained findings allow in total to produce <b>graphic</b> <b>paper</b> products more recycling-friendly, to recover them more specific by grade and to increase the quality of deinked pulp, resulting in a larger potential for the use of secondary fibers in paper production.

40|$|In my diploma thesis, I have {{analysed}} {{two techniques}} of deep print: etching and aquatint etching and presented the most evident {{artists who have}} created in the mentioned techniques. With formal analysis of art works of the artists, I have found out the role of tone values and linear quality in art composition and influence of tone and linear characteristics in relation to graphic art techniques. The analyses have been done by art works of the following authors: Francisco de Goya y Lucientes, Pablo Picasso, Bogdan Borčić, and Karel Zelenko. In the theoretic part, I have focused on combination of aquatint etching and etching. I have found the way, how to most appropriately and thoroughly create a sketch for combination of techniques.

40|$|Adjustment to {{a neutral}} colour balance when {{printing}} was {{the starting point}} in this degree project. Onthis base ICC-profiles were evaluated and assessed. The survey was concentrated on the similarity betweenreproductions on different papers with various ICC-profiles. The colour balancing introduced aconsistent variable between four <b>graphic</b> <b>papers.</b> With raised uniformity the probability increased toreceive similarities between the various combinations of ICC-profiles and papers. Numerous of measurements and calculations have been carried out, mainly to confirm whether or notadjustment to a neutral colour balance is possible and repeatable. Further more this gained in comparablevalues corresponding to similarities and divergences between combinations of ICC-profiles andpaper. The research concluded {{in the fact that}} it was possible to reach a neutral colour balance. One ICCprofileused together with various papers and also one paper with several ICC-profiles resulted in similaritiesand formed groups of samples. Since equivalent results could be reached on different samples,it implicated that variations within one paper shouldn’t affect the ICC-profiles. This was valid when thevariations were less than the divergence between the papers. Certain predictions on the question of from which paper the ICC-profiles should be generated to createhighest quality in print hasn’t been able to assemble. It’s likely that equivalent results could begenerated on G-Print, Multi Art Matt and Multi Art Silk...|$|E

40|$|I invite conference {{attendees}} to {{a discussion}} of ideas presented in a ‘graphic paper’ (sent out a week before the conference) addressing themes of emergence between wholes and parts as these relate to our comprehension of what the world must be like for our understanding of it to make sense. The comic book form is used in the paper for its inherent emergent qualities. The relationship between images, dialogue, panels, gutters, page composition and narrative elements, holistically make this form archetypal in addressing the themes of the paper and the conference. The challenge of the <b>graphic</b> <b>paper,</b> which explores bronze as a metaphor in defining the holistic properties that emerge from the joining of tin and copper, is to assess the consequences of synthesising the ideas of emergence in the writings of both Deleuze and Jung. In Deleuze’s collaboration with Felix Guattari, their writing points to the emergent properties within art as containing the ability to reterritorialize our relations with the world. ‘What defines the territory is the emergence of matters of expression (qualities) …Can this becoming, this emergence, be called art?’ (1998 p. 315 - 316) And in Jung’s formation of the Transcendent Function ‘which creates a transition from one attitude to another’ as the engine of individuation, where a third thing emerges from this process, ‘a changed situation’, ‘a new attitude’, through a dialogue between conscious and unconscious (The Structure and Dynamics of the Psyche CW 8 p 88 - 89).   Alongside Jung and Deleuze the <b>graphic</b> <b>paper</b> will add to this crucible, ideas from Critical Realist Roy Bhaskar (1944 - 2014) (Dialectic: The Pulse of Freedom (2008 : p 49 - 56) and Assemblage theorist Manuel DeLanda (1952 -)  Philosophy and simulation: The Emergence of Synthetic Reason (2011) as both of these thinkers present ways of appreciating ‘generative mechanisms’ (Bhaskar, A Realist Theory of Science, 1975) as a way of adding to our understanding of reality without ever claiming to have knowledge of things in themselves (Kant 1724 - 1804)  Critique of Pure Reason (1781). The claim of the <b>graphic</b> <b>paper</b> is that these four Realist thinkers present a movement beyond the constraints of positivism’s ‘epistemic fallacy’, postmodernism’s solipsistic ‘linguistic turn’, and clears a path for what Robert M. Pirsig (1928 - 2017) terms Dynamic Quality, the pre-intellectual cutting edge of reality...|$|R
