5|$|Seo {{was born}} in Seoul, South Korea. Her mother, aunt, and {{grandmother}} all studied fine arts and she, along with her two older and younger brothers, studied piano and took swimming lessons. Seo has stated {{that one of the}} reasons she has a strong relationship with her mother was because she did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister.</b>|$|E
5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, Ima did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister</b> named Ura. Texas legend insists that when Jim Hogg ran for {{re-election}} as Texas governor in 1892 he often travelled with Ima {{and a friend}} of hers and introduced them as his daughters Ima and Ura. Ima Hogg maintained throughout her life that this never happened. She was frequently forced to dispel the myth; hundreds of people wrote her letters inquiring whether her name was real and if she really had a sister named Ura. The Kansas City Star even invented another sister, Hoosa.|$|E
25|$|The present Mrs Bland is {{the second}} Mrs Bland. Mr Bland said his wife was the sole living {{relative}} for her family inheritance but she cannot both be sole heir and <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister.</b> Mr Bland's first wife died in the Second World War; he remarried soon after, to another Canadian woman. The family of his first wife had cut off communication with their daughter so thoroughly {{they did not know}} she had died. Sixteen years later, the first wife was announced to be the heiress to an overseas fortune as the last-known living relative. When this news reached the Blands, they decided the second Mrs Bland must pose as the first Mrs Bland. They fool a British firm of solicitors that sought the heir. When Quentin Duguesclin, who knew the first wife and her family, looked her up in England, a plan was laid to murder him. The plan was simple, with additions like the clocks taken from an unpublished mystery story that Miss Martindale had read in manuscript.|$|E

2500|$|Depending on {{the region}} and {{particular}} family, daughters were not entered into the family records and thus did not share the boys' generation name, although they may have borne a separate one among themselves. Even where generation names are not used, siblings' names are frequently related, so that a boy named Song ( [...] , lit. [...] "Pine") might <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister</b> named Mei ( [...] , lit. [...] "Plum").|$|E
2500|$|Despite the impassioned {{rivalry between}} the two universities, there is also much {{cooperation}} when the need arises. Most Oxford colleges <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister</b> college in Cambridge. Some Oxford and Cambridge colleges with the same name are 'sisters': for example, Jesus College, Cambridge, and Jesus College, Oxford. However, namesakes are not always paired up: for example, St John's College, Oxford, is the sister college of Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge, while St John's College, Cambridge, is the sister college of Balliol College, Oxford. Arrangements between sister colleges vary, but may include reciprocal offers of accommodation to students from the other university when they are visiting. Furthermore, {{a significant proportion of}} academic staff has at some point {{been a member of the}} [...] "other place".|$|E
2500|$|Hermione Jean Granger is a Muggle-born, Gryffindor {{student who}} becomes best friends with Harry Potter and Ron Weasley. J.K. Rowling states {{that she was}} born on 19 September 1979 and she was nearly twelve when she first {{attended}} Hogwarts. She is an overachiever who excels academically and is described by Rowling as a [...] "very logical, upright and good" [...] character. Rowling adds that Hermione's parents, two Muggle dentists, are a bit bemused by their odd daughter but [...] "very proud of her all the same." [...] They {{are well aware of}} the wizarding world and have visited Diagon Alley with her. Hermione was originally intended to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister,</b> but the planned sibling did not make an appearance in the first Harry Potter novel and, as Rowling noted, it [...] "seemed too late" [...] to introduce the character after that. Rowling confirmed in a 2004 interview that Hermione is an only child.|$|E

2500|$|Rabbi Eleazar {{interpreted}} the words [...] "He withdraws not {{his eyes from}} the righteous" [...] in [...] to teach that God rewards righteousness, even generations later. The Gemara taught that in reward for Rachel's modesty as shown in her dealings with Jacob, God rewarded her with King Saul as a descendant. The Gemara taught that Jacob asked Rachel, [...] "Will you marry me?" [...] She replied, [...] "Yes, but my father is a trickster, and he will outwit you." [...] Jacob replied, [...] "I am his brother in trickery." [...] She said to him, [...] "Is it permitted to the righteous to indulge in trickery?" [...] He replied, [...] "Yes, with the pure you show yourself pure, and with the crooked you show yourself subtle." [...] He asked her, [...] "What is his trickery?" [...] She replied: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>sister</b> older than I am, and he will not let me marry before her." [...] So Jacob gave her certain tokens through which he could identify her. When night came, she said to herself, [...] "Now my sister will be put to shame," [...] so she gave Leah the tokens. Thus when [...] reports, [...] "And it came to pass in the morning that, behold, it was Leah," [...] we are not to infer that up until then she had not been Leah, but rather that on account of the tokens that Rachel had given Leah, Jacob did not know until then that it was Leah. Therefore, God rewarded Rachel with having Saul among her descendants..|$|E
