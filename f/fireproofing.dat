5|$|Using these {{metal frames}} for taller buildings, however, meant exposing them to {{increased}} wind pressure. As a consequence, protective wind bracing {{had to be}} introduced, enabled {{by the work of}} Augustin-Jean Fresnel who produced equations for calculating the loads and moments on larger buildings. Metal-framed buildings were also vulnerable to fire and required special <b>fireproofing.</b> French engineers had made advances in this area in the early 19th century, and major breakthroughs came with the work of architect Peter Wight in the 1860s. Spurred on by the catastrophic fires in Chicago in 1871 and Boston in 1872, his findings were turned into a wide variety of patented <b>fireproofing</b> products during the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|A {{shipping}} and receiving ramp, which served the entire World Trade Center complex, occupied the eastern {{quarter of the}} 7World Trade Center footprint. The building was open below the 3rd floor, providing space for truck clearance on the shipping ramp. The spray-on <b>fireproofing</b> for structural steel elements was gypsum-based Monokote, which had a two-hour fire rating for steel beams, girders and trusses, and a three-hour rating for columns.|$|E
5|$|NIST {{found that}} the <b>fireproofing</b> on the Twin Towers' steel {{infrastructures}} was blown off by the initial impact of the planes and that, had this not occurred, the towers likely would have remained standing. A 2007 study of the north tower's collapse published by researchers of Purdue University determined that, since the plane's impact had stripped off much of the structure's thermal insulation, the heat from a typical office fire would have softened and weakened the exposed girders and columns enough to initiate the collapse regardless {{of the number of}} columns cut or damaged by the impact.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Given {{the fire}} {{accidents}} in recent years, we should placed great importance on the <b>fireproof</b> materials of buildings except arson. This paper summarized the research status methods and distinguishing features of <b>fireproof</b> materials in China {{which would make}} progress to our research on <b>fireproof</b> materials. The Research of <b>Fireproof</b> Materials in China With the rapid development of social economy in recent years, many monster high-rise buildings spring {{up all over the}} country. The Chinese technologist gradually realized the importance of <b>fireproof</b> materials of fire accident prevention accompanied more and more fire accidents. According to the literature on <b>fireproof</b> materials recently, the research of <b>fireproof</b> materials divide into three directions approximately: the classes of <b>fireproof</b> materials, the principle of <b>fireproof</b> materials and the special applications of <b>fireproof</b> materials in different fields [1] 1. 1 The research on class of <b>fireproof</b> materials classified various materials which include HPL(Pecorative high-Pressure Lcminate), fire resistant doorsets, fire-resisting wood windows, fire roller shutter, Anti-fire Glass, <b>fireproof</b> storage box, fire-retardant coatings and fire-proof sealing materials. 1. 2 The research on the principle of <b>fireproof</b> materials analyzed the flameproof procedures based on principle and prevention measures for preventing even holding back fires though experimentations and theoretical analysis [2] 1. 3 The applied research of dedicated <b>fireproof</b> materials studied the application of <b>fireproof</b> materials in different situation. In accordance with different situation and different environmental needs, certain differences also existed in the selection of <b>fireproof</b> materials [3 - 4]. The research had revealed the particularity, advantages of various <b>fireproof</b> materials and different application or selection in different situation. The special research of Chinese <b>fireproof</b> materials in many different fields would be more professional in future...|$|R

5|$|On February 13, 1975, a three-alarm fire {{broke out}} on the 11th floor of the North Tower. The fire spread through {{the core of the}} {{building}} to the 9th and 14th floors, as the insulation for telephone cables, located in a utility shaft that ran vertically between floors, had been ignited. Areas most affected by the fire were extinguished almost immediately, and the original fire was put out in a few hours. Most of the damage was on the 11th floor, where the fire was fueled by cabinets filled with paper, alcohol-based fluid for office machines, and other office equipment. <b>Fireproofing</b> protected the steel, and there was no structural damage to the tower. In addition to the fire damage on the 9th and 14th floors, water used to extinguish the fire damaged a few floors below. At the time, the World Trade Center complex had no fire sprinkler systems.|$|E
5|$|Despite being a {{major power}} of the cotton {{industry}} {{in the first quarter}} of the 19th century, the Strutts' company began to lose out to competition from Lancashire mill towns. The problem of shifting markets affected the entire Derwent Valley; Lancashire was better situated than Derbyshire in relation to the raw materials and new markets. The mills run by the Strutt family also suffered from a lack of modernisation; although they were at the forefront of <b>fireproofing</b> technology at the start of the 19th century, as the machines the mills used got bigger and more powerful, the Strutts persevered with child labour where adults would have been more adept at using the machinery. The company declined and in the second half of the 19th century some of its mills were leased or sold off to other companies. Although the cotton industry in the Derwent Valley declined, many of the structures associated with the industrial processes associated with producing cotton and workers' housing has survived and there are 848 listed buildings in the World Heritage Site.|$|E
5|$|The Blackstone is a 22-floor {{rectangular}} {{structure and}} its structural steel frame is cased in tile and plaster <b>fireproofing.</b> On the exterior {{south and east}} (front) elevations is a one-story base of pink granite, with high arched openings; it supports the red brick- and terra cotta-trimmed building shaft. Above the granite base are four stories of white, glazed terra cotta. The large windows of {{the second and third}} floor, which once poured natural light into the lobby, ballroom, and restaurants, have mostly been covered for a theater. The majority of the building rises as a 12-story shaft of red brick dotted with white, terra cotta window surrounds; above this section is a belt course of terra cotta and two stories of red brick. Above this, the original design included an intermediate terra cotta cornice topped by a cast-iron railing. This has been removed and replaced with red brick and white glazed brick, flush {{with the rest of the}} building. The mansard roof was originally decorated with small spires around the perimeter, and 2 very tall flagpoles.|$|E

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some floor tiles, ceiling tiles, shingles, <b>fireproofing,</b> heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process.
