40|$|International audienceThe {{anchoring}} of liquid-crystal (LC) mesogens to {{the surfaces}} of colloids {{is an important factor}} in determining intercolloidal interactions and the symmetry of the ensuing colloidal assembly in nematic colloids. The dynamic control of surface anchoring could therefore provide a handle to tune the colloidal organization and resulting properties in these systems. In this article, we report our results on the study of thermotropic nematic LC (E 7) dispersions of silica and glass microcolloids bearing photosensitive surface azobenzene groups. By the photoinduced modulation of the colloidal-LC interfacial properties, due to the trans-cis isomerization of azobenzene units, we tune the anchoring on silica colloids from homeotropic (trans-azobenzene) to <b>homogeneous</b> <b>planar</b> (cis-azobenzene) reversibly. In tune with the change in surface anchoring, the interparticle interactions were also dictated by dipolar and quadrupolar symmetries for homeotropic and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>planar</b> anchoring, respectively. In our experiments, we find that, in addition to the isomerization state of the surface-bound azobenzene units, the nature of the colloid plays a crucial role in determining the anchoring state obtained on applying photostimuli. We also study the LC anchoring on colloids as a function of the azobenzene surface density and find that beyond a threshold value the anchoring properties remain invariant...|$|E

40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{analysis of}} homeotropic alignment induced by nanoparticles (NPs) in a nematic liquid crystal (NLC) sample cell is presented. It is found that such alignment {{on the surface}} of a NP causes a change in the orientation of the molecular director near the surface, which in turn induces variations in the elastic constants and free energy. The induced NLC properties allow coupling between nearby NPs, mediated by the NLC molecules. The rotation of the coupled NPs close to the substrate tends to induce a long-range orientation of the NLC molecular director, leading to modification in the alignment at the interface of NLC and substrate which induces the orientation from <b>homogeneous</b> (<b>planar)</b> to homeotropic (vertical) in the bulk material...|$|E

In particular, we first introduce the basic concept of DFT, and then present computations for fluid films on planar and spherically symmetric walls. We present equilibrium density profiles and adsorption isotherms. We also compare our results to predictions from a sharp-interface approximation (SIA) and suggest a piecewise function approximation (PFA), which assumes that the density profile at the wall-liquid and the liquid-vapor interfaces varies smoothly. ar X i...|$|E
