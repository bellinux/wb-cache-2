5|$|During the Harrier's {{service the}} RAF {{positioned}} {{the bulk of}} the aircraft in West Germany to defend against a potential invasion of Western Europe by the Warsaw Pact forces; the unique abilities of the Harrier allowed the RAF to disperse their forces away from vulnerable airbases. The USMC used their Harriers primarily for close air support, operating from amphibious assault ships, and, if needed, forward operating bases. Harrier squadrons saw several deployments overseas. The Harrier's ability to operate with minimal <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> and very short runways allowed it to be used at locations unavailable to other fixed-wing aircraft. The Harrier received criticism for having a high accident rate and for a time-consuming maintenance process.|$|E
5|$|In May 2003, when Nigeria Airways had a Boeing 737-200 as its sole {{serviceable}} aircraft, {{the government}} {{decided not to}} pump more money into the overstaffed carrier but to liquidate it. The decision {{was based on the}} declining performance of the airline's last 15 years of operations and on the carrier's debts. The number of carried passengers had fallen from 2,1million in 1985 to just 10,000 {{in the first quarter of}} 2003, and it controlled just 6% and 1% of the domestic and the international markets, respectively. The carrier owed over million, despite the government having injected million into the company in its last decade of operations. The airline ceased operations in 2003 and was liquidated a year later. The Nigerian government later came to an agreement with Virgin Atlantic Airways to found Virgin Nigeria Airways, intended as a replacement. Even though Virgin Nigeria suceeded Nigeria Airways, the <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> of the folded Nigeria Airways were eventually taken over by the then-startup carrier Arik Air.|$|E
5|$|Moston Juniors is a youth {{football}} club, {{formed in}} 1993. The club has Active Sports and Charity Club status {{and was the}} first club in Manchester to receive FA Charter Standard Community Club status. The club signed the lease for Ronald Johnson Playing fields in 2007, with work to improve the site being completed in 2009 due to a grant from Manchester City Council and the Football Foundation. The club had further plans {{with the help of a}} proposed £750,000 council grant to build a clubhouse and upgrade their pitches, however they were unable to secure sufficient additional funding to make the project happen. On announcement of the intended redevelopment of the Ronald Johnson Playing fields into a new stadium, Moston Juniors entered into a partnership with F.C.

5|$|Nigeria Airways had {{its heyday}} {{in the early}} 1980s, just before the {{departure}} of a KLM team that had been hired to make the airline efficient and profitable. At that time, its fleet consisted of about 30 aircraft, but the carrier was two years behind with its accounts {{to the extent that}} aircraft were acquired for cash. Owned or leased, the carrier operated a variety of aircraft during its history, including the Airbus A310, the Boeing 737, and the Douglas DC-10, of which it flew the last one ever built. Plagued by mis-management, corruption, and overstaffing, at the time of closure the airline had debts totalling , a poor safety record, and its operative fleet comprised a single aircraft flying domestic routes as well as two leased aircraft operating the international network. Nigeria Airways was succeeded by Virgin Nigeria, and the <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> were taken over by Arik Air.|$|E

25|$|By 1958, the {{beginnings}} of the Primorye region's passenger-jet era started with the introduction of the Tupolev Tu-104 airliner, and the Tupolev Tu-114D which completed the first trial, scheduled, non-stop flight from Moscow to Vladivostok (on Aeroflot) in May 1958. When the size of the Ozernye Klyuchi airport restricted Vladivostok Air's expansion, the <b>ground</b> <b>facilities</b> were improved to allow regular flights with Tu-104s (1958), Ilyushin Il-18s (1963), and Antonov An-10s (1964). These improvements to the airport sharply increased passenger volumes. The first brick built terminal opened in February 1961, facilitating the processing of up to 200 passengers at once, marking the beginning of the larger airport known as Vladivostok International Airport.|$|E

25|$|Founded in 1976 {{following}} {{the demise of}} the town's former club, they joined the United Counties League in 1980 and enjoyed instant success; winning the United Counties League Division One and the United Counties League Cup in the club's first year of formation. Following three promotions in four seasons in the early 1990s, the club were promoted to the Conference National in 1994. Despite winning the league in the 1995–96 season, the club were denied promotion to the Football League due to insufficient <b>ground</b> <b>facilities.</b> Stevenage were finally promoted to the Football League after winning the Conference National in the 2009–10 season. On securing Football League status, the club dropped the word 'Borough' from its title. Stevenage earned back-to-back promotions when they beat Torquay United 1–0 at Old Trafford in the 2010–11 play-off final.|$|E
25|$|Coastal Command Spitfires and Lockheed Hudsons of the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit {{flew from}} Norway to the Spanish border to {{photograph}} German-occupied ports, {{looking for signs}} of invasion preparations. Nothing was revealed until the second week of August, when accumulations of barges were found and interpreted as an invasion preparation. In the meantime, Bomber Command sent its bombers nightly against the German ports, aircraft industry and airfields when unable to bomb the primary target. The Blenheims of 2 Group made daylight attacks on airfields occupied by the Luftwaffe. In July ports and shipping were made the priority target but until the ports filled with invasion craft in August, Bomber Command continued to attack industry and Luftwaffe <b>ground</b> <b>facilities.</b> The Germans had 400 airfields available and dispersed aircraft around them, making bombing ineffectual. These targets were defended by large concentrations of anti-aircraft artillery, making ground strafing too risky. The Blenheims were vulnerable to fighter attack and the crews had orders to abandon raids unless there was 7/10ths cloud {{and by the end of}} June, 90 percent of sorties were cancelled. The Blenheims—with some Fairey Battles returned from France—began to fly on moonlit nights. In July 1940, Bomber Command lost 72 aircraft carrying out these operations.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of reentry space vehicles requires a precise qualification of their thermal protection system materials. The material catalytic properties should be determined for test conditions {{relevant to the}} real flight mission program. However, perfect reproduction of the flight environment in a <b>ground</b> <b>facility</b> is practically impossible for reacting flows and one is obliged to resort to a partial simulation. In an attempt to overcome such an issue, we present a methodology that allows establishing under which hypothesis and approximations the flowfield inside a <b>ground</b> <b>facility</b> is equivalent, regarding the heat flux load, to the real flowfield experienced by a space vehicle. The analytical results of the theory are compared with numerical predictions and agree favorably with them...|$|R

25|$|After three {{successive}} {{seasons in}} the United Counties Premier Division, the club joined Division Two North of the Isthmian League in 1984, and the following season earned promotion to Division One after finishing the season as champions. However, two years later the club were relegated back to the Division Two North, having finished second bottom of the division. After two fourth-placed finishes, under the new management of Paul Fairclough, the club won promotion during the 1990–91 campaign, winning 34 of their 42 games, including every match played at home, scoring 122 goals and amassing 107 points. The following season, the club won the Division One championship, remaining unbeaten at home again, and were promoted to the Isthmian Premier Division. The club's long unbeaten home record was finally ended by Dulwich Hamlet, with the streak lasting 44 matches, of which 42 were won. During the 1993–94 season, Stevenage won the Premier Division, and were subsequently promoted to the Football Conference. Two seasons later, they won the Conference, but were denied promotion to the Football League, due to insufficient <b>ground</b> <b>facilities,</b> thus reprieving Torquay United, who had finished bottom of Division Three. During the same season, the Hertfordshire club reached the First Round of the FA Cup for the first time, but lost 2–1 to Third Division side Hereford United at Edgar Street.|$|E
