5|$|The Eye's {{flight from}} {{and return to}} Egypt was a common feature of temple ritual in the Ptolemaic and Roman periods (305 BC–AD 390), when the new year and the Nile flood that came along with it were celebrated as {{the return of the}} Eye after her wanderings in foreign lands. The Egyptians built shrines along the river {{containing}} images of animals and dwarfs rejoicing at the goddess' arrival. Scholars do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> developed the myth and the corresponding rituals were in earlier times. One of the oldest examples is Mut's return to her home temple in Thebes, which was celebrated there annually as early as the New Kingdom. At the temple of Montu at Medamud, in a festival that may date back to the late Middle Kingdom, it was Montu's consort Raettawy who was equated with Hathor and the Eye of Ra. The return of this Eye goddess, in fertile, moisture-bearing form, set the stage for her subsequent marriage to Montu and the birth of their mythological child, a form of Horus. The temple's new year festival celebrated her homecoming with drinking and dancing, paralleling the goddess' inebriated state after her pacification. In other cities, two goddesses were worshipped as the belligerent and peaceful forms of the Eye, as with Ayet and Nehemtawy at Herakleopolis or Satet and Anuket at Aswan.|$|E

500|$|In his Life of Samuel Johnson Boswell {{referred}} to Johnson as 'Dr. Johnson' {{so often that}} he would always be known as such, even though he hated being called such. Boswell's emphasis on Johnson's later years shows him too often as merely an old man discoursing in a tavern to a circle of admirers. Although Boswell, a Scotsman, was a close companion and friend to Johnson during many important times of his life, {{like many of his}} fellow Englishmen Johnson had a reputation for despising Scotland and its people. Even during their journey together through Scotland, Johnson [...] "exhibited prejudice and a narrow nationalism". Hester Thrale, in summarising Johnson's nationalistic views and his anti-Scottish prejudice, said: [...] "We all <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> he loved to abuse the Scotch, & indeed to be abused by them in return." ...|$|E

Motoki was selected as best actor at several ceremonies, including at the Asian Film Awards, the Asia Pacific Screen Awards, and the Blue Ribbon Awards; he was also viewers' choice for best actor at the Golden Rooster Awards. At the 29th Hong Kong Film Awards, Departures was selected as Best Asian Film, beating three Chinese films [...] and Ponyo.

500|$|On 8 August 2010, Robinson {{retired from}} {{international}} football with immediate effect, despite having been selected for a friendly against Hungary. He said about his retirement, [...] "Only now have I {{been able to}} make this decision as previously I haven't been in contention for selection, I don't see myself as a number three or four keeper and find that role very frustrating," [...] while Allardyce backed his decision, stating, [...] "As my player, I support him because I see him week in, week out and <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>well</b> he has performed. It's a big decision he's made, but I understand it." [...] In his international career, Robinson had won 41 caps for England, 25 of which came in competitive international matches (either the qualification or final rounds of the FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship). Despite Steve Kean stating that England should recall him in March 2012, Robinson stated that he had no interest in a return later that month. In February 2014, Robinson said that he would be open to an international return for the 2014 FIFA World Cup if England manager Roy Hodgson decided to recall him.|$|E
