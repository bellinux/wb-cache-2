5|$|In {{the left}} heart, oxygenated blood is {{returned}} to the left atrium via the pulmonary veins. It is then pumped <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle through the mitral valve and into the aorta through the aortic valve for systemic circulation. The aorta is a large artery that branches into many smaller arteries, arterioles, and ultimately capillaries. In the capillaries, oxygen and nutrients from blood are supplied to body cells for metabolism, and exchanged for carbon dioxide and waste products. Capillary blood, now deoxygenated, travels into venules and veins that ultimately collect in the superior and inferior vena cavae, and into the right heart.|$|E
5|$|Initial aerial firing {{tests with}} the Vulcan cannon {{on the second}} {{aircraft}} were successful, but on 17 December, {{there was an explosion}} during a firing burst and the J65 engine suffered severe compressor stalls. Tony LeVier immediately shut down the engine and glided back to make a successful deadstick landing at Rogers Dry Lake. An investigation later showed that one of the 20mm cannon rounds had exploded in the breech, blowing the bolt out the rear of the gun and through the structure into the forward fuselage fuel cell. Jet fuel had run into the gun bay, and leaked out of the compartment door seals and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> engine air intake. The engine immediately flooded with fuel, causing the compressor stalls.|$|E

5|$|On August 9 {{against the}} Kansas City Royals, Molina {{came in with}} two outs and the bases loaded. After drawing a 1–0 count against Peter Moylan, a brief delay {{occurred}} when a stray kitten had made its way onto the outfield. On the very next pitch to Molina, he hit it 387 feet <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> field seats for a go-ahead grand slam. This was the 5th grand slam of his career, tying him with Tim McCarver for second-most career grand slams by a Cardinals catcher. This also {{proved to be the}} deciding hit in this game, as the Cardinals held up to win, 8–5.|$|E
5|$|The 2nd Army Group was not {{directly}} attacked {{during the first}} few days of the invasion, but events to the east and west of its deployment area resulted in successive orders to withdraw to the lines of the Drava and Danube then the Sava. On 10 April, the crumbling defences of the 4th Army on the left flank of the 1st Army Group had been penetrated by the German 8th Panzer Division, which then turned east and drove <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> flank of the 1st Army Group on the following day. By the end of that day, the Germans had effectively routed the 2nd Army Group. Remnants continued to fight along the line of the Sava until early on 14 April, but mass surrenders began that day with tens of thousands of Yugoslav soldiers being taken into captivity by the Germans during their drive on Sarajevo in the centre of the country. The Yugoslav High Command unconditionally surrendered in Belgrade effective at 12:00 on 18 April.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, {{when the}} Indians {{took on the}} New York Yankees, Ramirez went 3 for 4 with his first two home runs, with many {{of his family and}} friends in attendance at Yankee Stadium. His first career home run was hit against Mélido Pérez. However, rather humorously, his first MLB hit off Perez was a ground rule double that bounced <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> field seats as left fielder Paul O'Neill pursued it. Ramirez, seeing the ball in the seats, continued running thinking he had hit a home run, before returning to second base while his teammates ribbed him. After flying out to O'Neill in his next plate appearance, Ramirez homered in his final two at bats.|$|E

5|$|The {{mammalian}} {{heart has}} four chambers, two upper atria, the receiving chambers, and two lower ventricles, the discharging chambers. The heart has four valves, which separate its chambers and ensures blood flows {{in the correct}} direction through the heart (preventing backflow). After gas exchange in the pulmonary capillaries (blood vessels in the lungs), oxygen-rich blood returns to the left atrium via {{one of the four}} pulmonary veins. Blood flows nearly continuously back into the atrium, which acts as the receiving chamber, and from here through an opening <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle. Most blood flows passively into the heart while both the atria and ventricles are relaxed, but {{toward the end of the}} ventricular relaxation period, the left atrium will contract, pumping blood into the ventricle. The heart also requires nutrients and oxygen found in blood like other muscles, and is supplied via coronary arteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{only major}} league {{pitching}} appearance of Musial's career occurred as {{a publicity stunt}} during the last Cardinals home game of the 1952 season. Manager Eddie Stanky had a reluctant Musial pitch to Frank Baumholtz, the runner-up to Musial for the best batting average in the NL that season. With Baumholtz batting right-handed {{for the first time}} in his career, Musial's first pitch was hit so hard it ricocheted off the shin of third baseman Solly Hemus and <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> field corner. The play was ruled an error, and Musial was embarrassed enough by his complicity in the gimmick to avoid pitching again for the remainder of his career.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid is {{supplied}} with arterial {{blood from the}} superior thyroid artery, {{a branch of the}} external carotid artery, and the inferior thyroid artery, a branch of the thyrocervical trunk, and sometimes by an anatomical variant the thyroid ima artery, which has a variable origin. The superior thyroid artery splits into anterior and posterior branches supplying the thyroid, and the inferior thyroid artery splits into superior and inferior branches. The superior and inferior thyroid arteries join together behind the outer part of the thyroid lobes. The venous blood is drained via superior and middle thyroid veins, which drain to the internal jugular vein, and via the inferior thyroid veins. The inferior thyroid veins originate in a network of veins and drain <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and right brachiocephalic veins. Both arteries and veins form a plexus between the two layers of the capsule of the thyroid gland.|$|E

5|$|Wrigley Field is {{featured}} in two interwoven and consecutive scenes. In the first scene, Rooney {{is looking for}} Ferris at a pizza joint while the voice of Harry Caray announces the action of a ballgame that is being shown on TV. From the play-by-play descriptions, the uniforms, and the player numbers, this game {{has been identified as}} the June 5, 1985, game between the Atlanta Braves and the Chicago Cubs. The batter rips a foul ball <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> field stands, and as Rooney looks away from the TV briefly, the TV cameras show a close up of Ferris a moment after catching it. The scene in the pizza joint continues as Rooney tries to banter about the game with the guy behind the counter.|$|E
5|$|Many {{blood vessels}} serve the {{esophagus}}, with blood supply varying along its course. The upper {{parts of the}} esophagus and the upper esophageal sphincter receive blood from the inferior thyroid artery, {{the parts of the}} esophagus in the thorax from the bronchial arteries and branches directly from the thoracic aorta, and the lower parts of the esophagus and the lower esophageal sphincter receive blood from the left gastric artery and the left inferior phrenic artery. The venous drainage also differs along the course of the esophagus. The upper and middle parts of the esophagus drain into the azygos and hemiazygos veins, and blood from the lower part drains <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> gastric vein. All these veins drain into the superior vena cava, {{with the exception of the}} left gastric vein, which is a branch of the portal vein. Lymphatically, the upper third of the esophagus drains into the deep cervical lymph nodes, the middle into the superior and posterior mediastinal lymph nodes, and the lower esophagus into the gastric and celiac lymph nodes. This is similar to the lymphatic drainage of the abdominal structures that arise from the foregut, which all drain into the celiac nodes.|$|E

5000|$|The heart's {{electrical}} activity {{begins in the}} sinoatrial node (the heart's natural pacemaker), which is situated on the upper right atrium. The impulse travels next through <b>the</b> <b>left</b> and right atria and summates at the atrioventricular node. From the AV node the electrical impulse travels down the bundle of His and divides <b>into</b> <b>the</b> right and <b>left</b> bundle branches. <b>The</b> right bundle branch contains one [...] <b>The</b> <b>left</b> bundle branch subdivides <b>into</b> two fascicles: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> anterior fascicle and <b>the</b> <b>left</b> posterior fascicle. Other sources divide <b>the</b> <b>left</b> bundle branch <b>into</b> three fascicles: <b>the</b> <b>left</b> anterior, <b>the</b> <b>left</b> posterior, and <b>the</b> <b>left</b> septal fascicle. <b>The</b> thicker <b>left</b> posterior fascicle bifurcates, with one fascicle being in the septal aspect. Ultimately, <b>the</b> fascicles divide <b>into</b> millions of Purkinje fibres, which in turn interdigitise with individual cardiac myocytes, allowing for rapid, coordinated, and synchronous physiologic depolarization of the ventricles.|$|R

25|$|The {{mechanism}} of aortic insufficiency (AI), comprises {{the pressure in}} the left ventricle falling below the pressure in the aorta, the aortic valve {{is not able to}} completely close. This causes a leaking of blood from the aorta <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle. This means that some of the blood that was already ejected from the heart is regurgitating back into the heart. The percentage of blood that regurgitates back through the aortic valve due to AI is known as the regurgitant fraction. This regurgitant flow causes a decrease in the diastolic blood pressure in the aorta, and therefore an increase in the pulse pressure. Since some of the blood that is ejected during systole regurgitates back <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle during diastole, there is decreased effective forward flow in AI.|$|E
25|$|Aortic {{insufficiency}} (AI), {{also known}} as aortic regurgitation (AR), is the leaking of the aortic valve of the heart that causes blood to flow in the reverse direction during ventricular diastole, from the aorta <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>left</b> ventricle. As a consequence, the cardiac muscle is forced to work harder than normal.|$|E
