50|$|As {{one of the}} {{original}} cohousing developments in the United States, the inspiration for the layout and framework of Muir Commons came primarily from European models of cohousing communities.

5000|$|Several Catholic {{colleges and}} universities, {{particularly}} those run by religious orders of priests (such as the Jesuits) used {{to employ the}} term [...] "rector" [...] {{to refer to the}} school's chief officer. In many cases, the rector was also the head of the community of priests assigned to the school, so the two posts [...] - [...] head of the university and local superior of the priests [...] - [...] were merged in the role of rector (See [...] "Ecclesiastical rectors" [...] below). This practice is no longer followed, as the details of the governance of most of these schools have changed. At the University of Notre Dame, the title [...] "rector" [...] is used for those in charge of <b>individual</b> <b>residence</b> halls.|$|E
5000|$|By 1890, <b>individual</b> <b>residence</b> halls {{were built}} {{to house the}} {{increasing}} number of students.William J. Hoynes was dean of the law school 1883-1919, and when its new building was opened shortly after his death it was renamed in his honor. The Rev. John Zahm CSC became the Holy Cross Provincial for the United States (1896-1906), with overall supervision of the university. He tried to modernize and expand Notre Dame, erecting buildings and adding to the campus art gallery and library, and amassing what became a famous Dante collection. His term was not renewed by the Congregation because of fears he had expanded Notre Dame too quickly and had run the Holy Cross order into serious debt.In 1919 Father James Burns became president of Notre Dame, and in three years he produced an academic revolution that brought the school up to national standards by adopting the elective system and moving away from the university's traditional scholastic and classical emphasis. By contrast, the Jesuit colleges, bastions of academic conservatism, were reluctant to move to a system of electives; for this reason, their graduates were shut out of Harvard Law School. Notre Dame continued to grow over the years, adding more colleges, programs, and sports teams. By 1921, with the addition of the College of Commerce, Notre Dame had grown from a small college to a university with five colleges and a professional law school. The university continued to expand and add new residence halls and buildings with each subsequent president.One of the main driving forces in the growth of the University was its football team, the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Knute Rockne became head coach in 1918. Under Rockne, the Irish would post a record of 105 wins, 12 losses, and five ties. During his 13 years the Irish won three national championships, had five undefeated seasons, won the Rose Bowl in 1925, and produced players such as George Gipp and the [...] "Four Horsemen". Knute Rockne has the highest winning percentage (.881) in NCAA Division I/FBS football history. Rockne's offenses employed the Notre Dame Box and his defenses ran a 7-2-2 scheme. The last game Rockne coached was on December 14, 1930, when he led a group of Notre Dame all-stars against the New York Giants in New York City.|$|E

Length of sections between the baffles, orifice diameter to vessel diameter ratio, {{and the flow}} rates were varied, with the flow always in the laminar regime. Conductivity measurements, involving tracer impulse response, were {{used to evaluate the}} concentrations in three of the tubular vessels six sections. Laguerre polynomial approximation was used to smooth the time dependent concentration related curves. A dependency on the flow conditions in the previous sections was found for all twelve cases studied. Accordingly, the <b>individual</b> <b>residence</b> time distributions were dependent upon each other; hence the <b>individual</b> <b>residence</b> time distributions did not convolute to give an overall {{residence time}} distribution and large deviation from plug flow within the tubular vessel existed...|$|E

30|$|The {{successful}} implementation of NQS {{is an important issue}} to address especially for FDC as it is a unique ECEC setting. For example, as usually only one carer attends a residence {{there needs to be a}} specific strategy to implement NQS within FDCs. This should function not only at scheme level, but also at <b>individual</b> <b>residence</b> level. Effective implementation to influence professional practice requires not only a top-down approach, but also a bottom-up approach that focuses on the local level (Fullan, 2000; Miles, 1998).|$|E
