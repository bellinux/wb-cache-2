40|$|Transfer of information-based {{services}} to an electronic environment is the accomplished fact. Some of such services lead to creation of electronic documents that are signed by qualified e-signature and have legal value equal to hand-signed documents. In fact, the documents are created not for private use but for an exchange with the others. The main {{challenge of the}} electronic document usage is their interoperability. An electronic document is a dual technical and legal artefact that depends on a national legislation system and “lives” within a national platform of electronic documents. Therefore, an electronic document is not a subject of technical standardization only. The paper introduces a new concept for an electronic document cross-border interoperability solution based on creation of original copies for each national electronic <b>document</b> <b>platform</b> of the document signatories...|$|E

5000|$|The Gatlin Site is {{an archaeological}} site in Arizona that {{preserves}} {{one of the}} few <b>documented</b> Hohokam <b>platform</b> mounds. Associated with the mound are pit houses, ball courts, middens, and prehistoric canals. Between AD 800 and 1200 it was an important Hohokam settlement at the great bend of the Gila River. The Hohokam people were the first farmers in southern Arizona, where the permanent Salt and Gila Rivers flowing through the hot Sonoran Desert made the irrigation strategy possible. [...] The site is the largest in the area and was home to over 500 people. Its importance is indicated by the presence of two ceremonial ball courts and one of the earliest platform mounds known. The mound is notable as being one of only few excavated and <b>documented</b> Sedentary Period <b>platform</b> mounds still relatively intact.|$|R

40|$|In this thesis, I {{address the}} {{challenges}} of developing tools which use a mixed-level approach to dynamic binary analysis. The mixed-level approach combines advantages of both source- based and binary-based approaches to dynamic analysis, but comes with the added challenge {{of dealing with the}} implementation details of a specific implementation of the target language. This thesis describes the implementation of three existing tools which use the mixed-level approach: Fjalar, a C/C++ dynamic analysis framework, Kvasir, A C/C++ value profiling tool, and Dyncomp, a tool for inferring the abstract types of a C or C++ program. Additionally, this thesis describes the steps I took in increasing the maintainability and portability of these tools. I investigated and <b>documented</b> <b>platform</b> specific dependencies; I documented the process of merging in upstream changes of Valgrind, the Dynamic Binary Instrumenter Fjalar is built on, to aid Fjalar in keeping in-sync with Valgrind bug-fixes; and I implemented a tool for debugging Dyncomp errors. by Robert Andrew Rudd.
