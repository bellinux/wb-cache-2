30|$|Although {{parents in}} China {{generally}} have high educational expectations <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children</b> (Ma 2010), parents of different socioeconomic status may provide different behavioral support <b>for</b> <b>their</b> childrenâ€™s education due to constraints {{in their own}} abilities and resources (such as discussing what happens in schools with <b>their</b> <b>children</b> and checking the homework <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>children).</b>|$|R

25|$|However, {{in other}} cultures, toys {{are used to}} expand the {{development}} of a child's cognition in an idealistic fashion. In these communities, adults place the value of play with toys to be on the aspirations they set forth <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b> In the Western culture, the Barbie and Action-Man represent lifelike figures but in an imaginative state out of reach from the society of these children and adults. These toys give way to a unique world in which children's play is isolated and independent of the social constraints placed on society leaving the children free to delve into the imaginary and idealized version of what their development in life could be.|$|E
25|$|Experiences in a person's {{life are}} {{a major source of}} how {{self-esteem}} develops. In the early years of a child's life, parents have a significant influence on self-esteem and can be considered a main source of positive and negative experiences a child will have. Unconditional love from parents helps a child develop a stable sense of being cared for and respected. These feelings translate into later effects on self-esteem as the child grows older. Students in elementary school who have high self-esteem tend to have authoritative parents who are caring, supportive adults who set clear standards <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and allow them to voice their opinion in decision making.|$|E

25|$|Healthy narcissism {{might exist}} in all individuals. Freud {{said that this}} is an {{original}} state from which the individual develops the love object. He argued that healthy narcissism {{is an essential part of}} normal development. According to Freud, the love of the parents <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> and their attitude toward their child could be seen as a revival and reproduction of their own narcissism. The child has an omnipotence of thought; the parents stimulate that feeling because in their child they see the things that they have never reached themselves. Compared to neutral observers, parents tend to overvalue the qualities of their child. When parents act in an extreme opposite style and the child is rejected or inconsistently reinforced depending on the mood of the parent, the self-needs of the child are not met. Freud contrasts the natural development of active-egoistic and passive-altruistic tendencies in the individual with narcissism, in the former, and what Trevor Pederson refers to as echoism, in the latter.|$|E
500|$|A survey {{conducted}} by Minnesota's Department for Families and Children's Services shows that men consider child care {{to be far more}} important than a paycheck. Of 600 dads surveyed, a majority said their most important role was to [...] "show love and affection" [...] to kids. [...] "Safety and protection" [...] came next, followed by [...] "moral guidance," [...] "taking time to play," [...] and [...] "teaching and encouraging." [...] "Financial care" [...] finished last. [...] Many men are now becoming more involved in their children's lives, and because of that many men now {{have a better understanding of}} what life is like <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> growing up in modern society. [...] Because fathers are immersed in their children's lives, many of the stereotypically [...] "manly" [...] attitudes and activities historically prescribed for children may be circumscribed due to a more gender-neutral parenting approach that focuses on promoting independence and emotional well being. This allows children, especially male children, to grow up with a greater capacity for empathy and less rigidity in attitudes pertaining to gender roles than would perhaps be the case in more traditionally-structured households.|$|E
500|$|Breyer wrote separately, {{concerned}} that the majority's decision conflicts with previous rulings from Ginsberg and Miller. He contrasted the previous findings regulating sales of publications containing nudity to those of violent video games: [...] "But what sense does it make to forbid selling to a 13-year-old boy a magazine with {{an image of a}} nude woman, while protecting a sale to that 13 year-old of an interactive video game in which he actively, but virtually, binds and gags the woman, then tortures and kills her?" [...] Breyer further argued that [...] "This case is ultimately less about censorship than it is about education," [...] believing that the Government has a vested interest in allowing parents to make decisions <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> as to [...] "raise future generations committed cooperatively to making our system of government work," [...] and that [...] "California's law imposes no more than a modest restriction on expression." [...] Breyer also expressed concern that the self-regulation of the industry still allowed for 20% of minors to purchase mature video games on a national average, and as high as 50% in the case of one nationwide chain, based on the aforementioned 2011 Federal Trade Commission study.|$|E

Relations are shaky as Angel kicks Connor {{out of the house}} in punishment for sinking him, but secretly keeps a protective eye on him from afar. Stricken by the betrayal of his adoptive father and the apparent abandonment by his real one, Connor seeks solace in Cordelia's arms. When an all-powerful demon lord The Beast rises from the ground at the place he was born, Connor feels responsible. As The Beast causes fire to rain from the sky in an apparent apocalypse, Cordelia sleeps with Connor to give him some happiness before the end. While an apocalypse does not occur, Angel (also in love with Cordelia) doesn't take kindly to the development, causing another rift between him and Connor. Unbeknownst to all, Cordelia is possessed to be with Connor by a cosmic entity, Jasmine, looking to give herself birth in this world through their union. As Cordelia becomes pregnant and manipulates Connor into helping her sacrifice an innocent girl <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> his inhuman actions begin conflicting with his inner good, accelerating his already deteriorating mental health.|$|E

A recent case affirming a duty to a spouse is R v Hood, where the Court of Appeal upheld a husband's conviction of gross negligence manslaughter, after he failed to summon medical attention for his wife â€“ a sufferer of osteoperosis â€“ after she fell and broke a number of bones. Familial relationships {{have been found to}} infer a duty to act where the proximity of the two family members is that of the same household, as shown by the cases of R v Stone & Dobinson and R v Chattaway, where neglect for an elderly sister and a daughter resulted in convictions of murder and manslaughter. Further, in the case of [...] "R v BW & SW (No 3)" [...] the mother of the deceased seven-year-old child was convicted of murder and father of manslaughter where the parents neglected to provide adequate nourishment and medical attention <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{right to}} choice is {{probably}} an individual right only, {{as opposed to}} also being a family right or a union right, however the rights are {{between you and the}} government and not between you and a member of your family. [...] In the 1995 Supreme Court case B. (R.) v. Childrenâ€™s Aid Society, in which two parents attempted to block a certain treatment <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child</b> on religious grounds, it was argued that the personal choice aspect of liberty guaranteed family privacy. [...] This argument drew from United States case law, but the Supreme Court of Canada pointed out section 7 of the Charter contains individual rights, and hence there cannot be family rights. [...] Still, mindful that there was still choices involved in the family situation, the Supreme Court split on whether liberty rights were infringed. [...] Likewise, in I.L.W.U. v. The Queen (1992), the Supreme Court stressed the individual nature of section 7 to deny unions had a right to strike as part of the members' liberty. [...] The Court also stressed that strikes were socioeconomic matters that did not involve the justice system, and section 7 was concentrated on the justice system.|$|E
2500|$|The appellants' lawyers, Willis S. Moore for {{the state}} and {{district}} attorneys, and George E. Chamberlain and Albert H. Putney, for the governor, argued that the state had an overriding interest to oversee and control the providers of education {{to the children of}} Oregon. One of them {{even went so far as}} to call Oregonian students [...] "the State's children". They contended that the State's interest in overseeing the education of citizens and future voters was so great that it overrode the parents' right to choose a provider of education <b>for</b> <b>their</b> <b>child,</b> and the right of the child to influence the parent in this decision. With respect to the appellees' claims that their loss of business infringed on Fourteenth Amendment rights, the appellants' lawyers countered that since appellees were corporations, not individuals, the Fourteenth Amendment did not directly apply to them. In addition, they asserted, the revenues of a corporation were not property, and thus did not fall under the due process clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Finally, they argued that since the law was not scheduled to take effect until September of the following year, the suits were brought prematurelyâ€”to protect against a possible coming danger, not to rectify a current problem.|$|E
