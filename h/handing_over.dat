40|$|The phrase <b>HAND</b> <b>OVER</b> FIST {{could be}} interepreted as an {{instruction}} {{to place the}} word <b>HAND</b> <b>over</b> the word Fist. When the letters of HAND and FIST are assigned their aphabetical values (a= 1, b= 2 etc.) HAND (8 + 1 + 14 + 4) = 27 and FIST (6 + 9 + 19 + 20) = 54.

Variations {{with more than}} two top and two bottom {{positions}} sometimes require the scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> more than two cards to the president, up {{to the number of}} top positions in the game. For example, a game with a secretary and clerk might call for the scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> three cards to the president, the vice-scum to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> two cards to the vice-president and the clerk to <b>hand</b> <b>over</b> one card to the secretary.

5|$|Philip had no {{intention}} of <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> Amphipolis to the Athenians, but acted as if he was just delaying the transfer of the city. He seems to have gone straight on to besiege Pydna after capturing Amphipolis. The Athenians, perhaps still hoping to receive Amphipolis if they allowed Philip to take Pydna, do not seem to have tried to intervene (and may not have been able to). Pydna seems to have fallen to Philip by treachery, in either 357 or 356 BC.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the election, Dato' Onn Ja'afar {{had changed}} his approach, forming the Parti Negara after IMP {{suffered}} crushing losses to the Alliance in local elections. Advocating stronger pro-Malay policies recognising Malay political dominance, the Parti Negara failed to shake the Alliance's grip on power. However, some believe Parti Negara's proposals helped sway UMNO politicians towards more radically pro-Malay policies. The British themselves insisted on <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> power only to a multiracial government, and the Alliance was considered to meet this requirement.|$|E

Percival, who had never got on with Bennett, wrote a letter accusing him of relinquishing his command without permission. Callaghan delivered the letter to Blamey upon his release and Blamey convened a court of enquiry under Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead, and Major Generals Victor Stantke and George Wootten, which found that Bennett was not justified in <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> his command, or in leaving Singapore. Veterans of the 8th Division, who were generally loyal to Bennett, protested against this finding.|$|E

5|$|I Airborne Corps {{became part}} of the First Allied Airborne Army, {{commanded}} by Lieutenant General Lewis H. Brereton, in August 1944.

During preparations for one of many cancelled operations, Linnete II, his disagreement with Brereton over a risky operation caused him to threaten resignation, which, due to differences in military culture, Brereton regarded as tantamount to disobeying an order. Browning was forced into a humiliating backdown.|$|E
5|$|In 1940, {{frustrated}} with the perceived lack of success against RAF Fighter Command, Göring was keen on infusing the fighter force leadership with younger blood. He perceived a lack of aggressiveness in the Jagdgeschwader leadership. The likes of Theo Osterkamp were the first victim of this policy, <b>handing</b> <b>over</b> JG 51 to Werner Mölders. Oesau {{was considered to be}} one such rising star. However, being a star and staying in Göring's favor required keeping up the kill rate and promotions were invariably linked to scores. According to Dr. Kurt Tank, the Focke–Wulf designer, although many of the younger generation were good flyers, they were unable to cope with problems of overall planning and broader strategic aspects. However, Oesau was one of the outstanding leaders ever produced by Luftwaffe fighter wings with the likes of Werner Mölders and Adolf Galland.|$|E
