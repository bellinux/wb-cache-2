30|$|In recent years, many scientists, {{owing to}} a high ability of <b>He–Ne</b> <b>lasers</b> for {{stabilizing}} in the Doppler line width range, have focused their attention on the enhancement of coherence time. In 1972, Balhorn et al. established the frequency stabilization theory {{in this type of}} lasers for the first time [3]. To stabilize the frequency of laser light, they controlled the voltage of laser power supply by using intensity changes arising from temperature variations. Their effort leaded to the stability of Δν/ν =  1  ×  10 − 7 (30 ×). In addition, after 1973, Bannet et al. achieved the stability of 2  ×  10 − 8 (160 ×) by the heating coil method [4]. Since then, passive and active methods with different designs and techniques have been developed for frequency and amplitude stabilization of <b>He–Ne</b> <b>lasers,</b> which has resulted in the stability of ∼ 10 − 16 (~ 1010 ×) [5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18].|$|R

5000|$|Laser {{linewidth}} in {{a typical}} single-transverse-mode <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> (at a wavelength of 632.8 nm), {{in the absence of}} intracavity line narrowing optics, can be of the order of 1 GHz. On the other hand, the laser linewidth from stabilized low-power continuous-wave lasers can be very narrow and reach down to less than 1 kHz. [...] Often this type of linewidth is limited by fundamental quantum processes. This limit is known as the Schawlow-Townes linewidth which can be lower than Hz for some kind of CW lasers. Nevertheless, observed linewidths are larger due to a technical noise (from noise in current, vibrations etc.).|$|E
5000|$|Laser {{diffraction}} {{analysis is}} accomplished via a red <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser,</b> a commonly used gas laser for physics experiments {{that is made}} up of a laser tube, a high-voltage power supply, and structural packaging. [...] Alternatively, blue laser diodes or LEDs of shorter wavelength may be used. Angling of the light energy produced by the laser is detected by having a beam of light go through a suspension and then onto a sensor. A lens is placed between the object being analyzed and the detector's focal point, causing only the surrounding laser diffraction to appear. The sizes the laser can analyze depend on the lens' focal length, the distance from the lens to its point of focus. As the focal length increases, the area the laser can detect increases as well, displaying a proportional relationship. A computer can then be used to detect the object's particle sizes from the light energy produced and its layout, which the computer derives from the data collected on the particle frequencies and wavelengths.|$|E

50|$|Surface plasmons {{are those}} plasmons that are {{confined}} to surfaces and that interact strongly with light resulting in a polariton. They occur at the interface of a material exhibiting positive real part of their relative permittivity, i.e. dielectric constant, (e.g. vacuum, air, glass and other dielectrics) and a material whose real part of permittivity is negative at the given frequency of light, typically a metal or heavily doped semiconductors. In addition to opposite sign of the real part of the permittivity, {{the magnitude of the}} real part of the permittivity in the negative permittivity region should typically be larger than the magnitude of the permittivity in the positive permittivity region, otherwise the light is not bound to the surface (i.e. the surface plasmons do not exist) as shown in the famous book by Raether. At visible wavelengths of light, e.g. 632.8 nm wavelength provided by a <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser,</b> interfaces supporting surface plasmons are often formed by metals like silver or gold (negative real part permittivity) in contact with dielectrics such as air or silicon dioxide. The particular choice of materials can have a drastic effect on the degree of light confinement and propagation distance due to losses. Surface plasmons can also exist on interfaces other than flat surfaces, such as particles, or rectangular strips, v-grooves, cylinders, and other structures. Many structures have been investigated due to the capability of surface plasmons to confine light below the diffraction limit of light.|$|E
5000|$|Practically, in many {{experiments}} with quantum reflection from Si, the grazing incidence angle is used (figure A). The set-up is mounted {{in a vacuum}} chamber to provide a several-meter path free of atoms; a good vacuum (at the level of 10−7 Torr or [...] ) is required. The magneto-optical trap (MOT) is used to collect cold atoms, usually excited He or Ne, approaching the point-like source of atoms. The excitation of atoms is not essential for the quantum reflection but it allows the efficient trapping and cooling using optical frequencies. In addition, the excitation of atoms allows the registration at the micro-channel plate (MCP) detector (bottom of the figure). Movable edges are used to stop atoms which do not go toward the sample (for example a Si plate), providing the collimated atomic beam. The <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> was used to control {{the orientation of the}} sample and measure the grazing angle [...] At the MCP, there was observed relatively intensive strip of atoms which come straightly (without reflection) from the MOT, by-passing the sample, strong shadow of the sample (the thickness of this shadow could be used for rough control of the grazing angle), and the relatively weak strip produced by the reflected atoms. The ratio [...] of density of atoms registered {{at the center of this}} strip to the density of atoms at the directly illuminated region was considered as efficiency of quantum reflection, i.e., reflectivity. This reflectivity strongly depends on the grazing angle and speed of atoms.|$|E
40|$|Helium-neon laser (<b>He-Ne</b> <b>Laser,</b> 632. 8 nm) is a {{low-energy}} laser {{that has}} therapeutic efficacy on various clinical conditions. Our previous study has demonstrated efficacy of <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> on vitiligo, a disease characterized by skin depigmentation. To regain skin tone on vitiligo lesions, the process began by {{the migration of}} the immature melanoblasts (MBs) to the epidermis, which was followed by their functional development to produce melanin. In this study, we investigated the physiologic effects of <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation on two MB cell lines: the immature NCCmelb 4 and the more differentiated NCCmelan 5. The intricate interactions between MBs with their innate extracelluar matrix, fibronectin, were also addressed. Our results showed that <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation enhanced NCCmelb 4 mobility via enhanced phosphorylated focal adhesion kinase expression and promoted melanogenesis in NCCmelan 5. In addition, <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> decreased the affinity between NCCmelb 4 and fibronectin, whereas the attachment of NCCmelan 5 to fibronectin increased. The α 5 β 1 integrin expression on NCCmelb 4 cells was enhanced by <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser.</b> In conclusion, we have demonstrated that <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> induced different physiologic changes on MBs at different maturation stages and recapitulated the early events during vitiligo repigmentation process brought upon by <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> in vitro...|$|E

Emission is very quick (relaxation time ~10 ns). At room temperature, no sharp peaks are observed because of the thermal broadening. However, cooling the N-V− centers with liquid nitrogen or liquid helium dramatically narrows the lines down to a width of a few megahertz.|$|R
40|$|A {{demonstration}} of CW parametric upconversion of 3. 39 -micron IR radiation inside a <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser's</b> optical cavity is reported. The upconversion was achieved {{with the aid}} of a 5145 -A argon laser pump and a lithium niobate crystal; the circulating power available inside the pump laser's cavity was used to maximize the efficiency of the upconversion process. Losses associated with the pump blocking filters and with the lithium niobate crystal are discussed.

Then: (i) changes in the activities of enzymes in I. indigotica cotyledon (such as amylase, transaminase, and proteinase) were measured to investigate the effects of <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> and microwave pretreatment; and (ii) biophoton emission was measured to determine the speed of cell division and metabolism.

40|$|Abstract The {{effect of}} <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> (632. 8 nm) pre-irra-diation on UVA (343 nm) -induced DNA {{damage in the}} human B-lymphoblast cell line NC 37 was {{investigated}} using the comet assay. <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> pre-irradiation was observed {{to result in a}} dose-dependent decrease in UVA-induced DNA damage. This effect was also found to be dependent on the incubation period between <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> pre-irradiation and the UVA exposure. Whereas the con-trol cells with a higher DNA damage point to an initial ability of faster repair, both the control and the He-Ne la-ser pre-irradiated cells subsequently show the same rate of DNA repair.

40|$|Clinical {{observations}} {{have suggested}} that low-energy lasers might promote wound healing. Evidence suggests that <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation induces {{an increase in the}} rate of keratinocyte migration and proliferation as compared with nonirradiated controls in vitro. This study sought to determine whether <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> could induce cytokine production in cultured keratinocytes. The results revealed (i) a significant increase in interleukin- 1 α and interleukin- 8 production and their respective mRNA expression in He-Ne laser–treated groups as compared with nonirradiated controls, and (ii) under 1. 5 joules/cm 2 irradiation, this stimulating effect of <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> treatment is concentration-dependent. Because interleukin- 1 α induces keratinocyte migration, this finding may partially explain the stimulatory effects on the motility of keratinocytes. As both interleukin- 1 α and inteleukin- 8 provoke proliferation of keratinocyes, it is not unreasonable to propose that these tow cytokines play a profound role in the enhancement of keratinocyte proliferation as a result of <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser</b> irradiation. Our findings provide further evidence of enhanced wound healing at the cellular and molecular level as result of the <b>He-Ne</b> <b>laser...</b>|$|E
