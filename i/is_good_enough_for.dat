5|$|On {{the day of}} the wedding, Mr. Burns and Jacqueline {{attempt to}} marry. However, Grampa crashes the {{ceremony}} and asks that Jacqueline marry him instead. Partly due to Mr. Burns' boorish behavior, she decides not to marry either man. Deciding that Jacqueline decision <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him, Grampa grabs her and they run out of the church and onto on a bus.|$|E
5|$|I {{realize that}} many good and able men have eloquently spoken and written, {{sometimes}} in rhapsodical strains, about {{the duty of}} this Court to keep the Constitution {{in tune with the}} times. The idea is that the Constitution must be changed from time to time, and that this Court is charged with a duty to make those changes. For myself, I must, with all deference, reject that philosophy. The Constitution makers knew the need for change, and provided for it. Amendments suggested by the people's elected representatives can be submitted to the people or their selected agents for ratification. That method of change was good for our Fathers, and, being somewhat old-fashioned, I must add it <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> me.|$|E

The power spectrum ignores all phase relations, which <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> many purposes, but for video signals other types of spectral analysis must also be employed, still using the Fourier transform as a tool.|$|E

25|$|The South Central Railway, {{in a bid}} to {{conserve}} water, installed a water recycling plant at Secunderabad railway station at a cost of Rs. 12million. The maintenance of trains including washing of 800 coaches, aprons and platforms of the station requires over 30,000 litres of water daily. With the installation of the water recycling plant all the used water is collected through pipes and sent to the plant for biological and chemical treatment. Though not fit for drinking, recycled water <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> cleaning the coaches and platforms.|$|E
500|$|Nas made {{reference}} to finding his daughter's letter {{to a man in}} jail and the controversy that ensued when she posted a photo of a box of condoms on Instagram. According to Kyle Ellison from Drowned in Sound, Nas also commented on gender expectations in his rap, citing the line [...] "when he date, he straight, chip off his old papa / when she date, we wait behind the door with a sawed off / 'cause we think no one <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> our daughters." ...|$|E
500|$|Chloe's {{relationship}} with her mother is one tackled both off-screen and behind the scenes. In a brainstorming session, Mack, Gough and Millar {{came up with the}} idea that Chloe's mother had left her at a young age. Mack wanted to make the character a [...] "latchkey kid", in an effort to explain why she is out all hours of the night. Mack feels that Chloe has real abandonment issues, which play on the fact that she never feels like she <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> anyone. These abandonment issues were meant to provide a reason for why the character is devastated by the fact that Clark does not love her the same way that she loves him, as well as the reason for why Chloe does not have many female friends. One of Chloe's story arcs in season five involved her finding her mother in a mental institution, and living with the fear that she will have a mental breakdown of her own and end up in a psychiatric facility. This fear also affects Clark, who worries that keeping his secret will have negative effects on Chloe, like it did Pete.|$|E

2500|$|At each step, the SA {{heuristic}} considers some {{neighbouring state}} s' {{of the current}} state s, and probabilistically decides between moving the system to state s' or staying in state s. [...] These probabilities ultimately lead the system to move to states of lower energy.

2500|$|Evans {{goes into}} {{considerable}} detail tracing {{references to the}} metals in classical literature: Latin aer, aeris and Greek chalkós first for [...] "copper" [...] and then for [...] "bronze." [...] He does not mention the adjective of aes, which is aēneus, nor is he interested in formulating New Latin words for the Copper Age, which <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> him and many English authors from then on. He offers literary proof that bronze had been in use before iron and copper before bronze.|$|E
2500|$|Mullagh {{was both}} an {{independent}} {{person and a}} passionate advocate of indigenous rights, refusing to dwell on state-controlled reserves. His political stance was revealed during a game at Apsley, when, as the players went to lunch, a white participant asked, [...] "What about the nigger?" [...] The captain replied, [...] "Let him have his dinner in the kitchen; anything <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> the nigger." [...] Mullagh refused {{to eat in the}} kitchen, and sat outside the hotel in protest.|$|E
2500|$|A chamber on the {{northeast}} side of the Abingdon house {{was referred to as}} [...] "General Washington's room" [...] during Hunter's ownership because George Washington had usually occupied this room while visiting his stepson, John Parke Custis.

2500|$|In 1930, as a {{freshman}} at Georgetown College, Foley was chosen by a talent scout from Chicago's WLS-AM to sing with producer John Lair's Cumberland Ridge Runners, the house band on National Barn Dance. His first single, [...] "Life <b>is</b> <b>Good</b> <b>Enough</b> <b>for</b> Me/Lonesome Cowboy", was released in June 1933 on the Melotone label. In 1937 he returned to Kentucky with Lair to help establish the Renfro Valley Barn Dance stage and radio show near Mt. Vernon in 1939, performing everything from ballads to boogie-woogie to blues. In late 1939, Foley became the first country artist to host a network radio program, NBC's Avalon Time (co-hosted by Red Skelton), and he performed extensively at theaters, clubs and fairs. He then returned for another seven-year stint with National Barn Dance.|$|E
2500|$|In Verona, Petruchio {{begins the}} [...] "taming" [...] {{of his new}} wife. She is refused food and {{clothing}} because nothing – according to Petruchio – <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her; he claims perfectly cooked meat is overcooked, a beautiful dress doesn't fit right, and a stylish hat is not fashionable. He also disagrees with everything she says, forcing her to agree with everything he says, no matter how absurd; {{on their way back}} to Padua to attend Bianca's wedding, she agrees with Petruchio that the sun is the moon, and proclaims [...] "if you please to call it a rush-candle,/Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me" [...] (4.5.14–15). Along the way, they meet Vincentio, who is also on his way to Padua, and Katherina agrees with Petruchio when he declares that Vincentio is a woman, and then apologises to Vincentio when Petruchio tells her he is a man.|$|E

The long names run off her tongue as glibly as ever,' sighed Hebert, who, though {{determined}} not to forsake his faith, by no means partook her enthusiasm for martyrdom.

2500|$|However, {{just before}} Socrates {{is about to}} leave, he is stopped by the [...] "familiar divine sign", his daemon, which always occurs and only just before Socrates is about to do {{something}} he should not. A voice [...] "from this very spot" [...] forbids Socrates to leave before he makes atonement for some offense to the gods. Socrates then admits that he thought both of the preceding speeches were terrible, saying Lysias' repeated itself numerous times, seemed uninterested in its subject, {{and seemed to be}} showing off. Socrates states that he is a [...] "seer". While he is not very good at it, he <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> his purposes, and he recognizes what his offense has been: if love is a god or something divine, as he and Phaedrus both agree he is, he cannot be bad, as the previous speeches have portrayed him. Socrates, baring his head, vows to undergo a rite of purification as a follower of the Muses, and proceeds to give a speech praising the lover.|$|E

It was also revealed that Mick and Linda have a third child, Lee, who is a soldier in Afghanistan. Treadwell-Collins released a statement saying: [...] "My team have worked incredibly hard {{over the past few}} months to create the Carters—a contemporary British family with cracks, knocked edges and a touch of darkness that is going to make them very special to watch. A family of strong characters who love and hate each other, all rooted in the best traditions of EastEnders. Starting with Shirley, the Carters are slowly going to creep into Albert Square as Christmas approaches and by New Year, there will be a new vibrant EastEnders clan, firmly ensconced in the Queen Vic. Watch out Walford, The Carters are coming!" [...] Dyer said that Mick is protective of Nancy and does not think her fiancé, Wayne Ladlow (Malachi Kirby), <b>is</b> <b>good</b> <b>enough</b> <b>for</b> her.
