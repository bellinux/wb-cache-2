Having {{deposited}} my brown beauty in a red nook of the hearth, inside the fender, where she soon began to sing like an ethereal cricket, diffusing at the same time odours as of ripe vineyards, spice forests, and orange groves,--I say, having stationed my beauty in a place of security and improvement, I <b>introduced</b> myself to <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> by shaking hands all round, and giving them a hearty welcome.|$|R

The objectives were to practice the activities as a tour guide, {{to find out the}} problems and solutions as a tour guide The first step in job training, I escorted the senior tour guide. I could know the activities of tour guide in a tour. It was used as a reference for guiding the guests. In guiding process, there were three steps i. e. (1) Preparation: I saw the schedule of the tour for the day after. The schedule was written on the whiteboard by receptionist. After I knew my tour for tomorrow, I prepared the list of the guests and their hotel names,(2) Method of the tour:I picked up the guests at their hotel one by one. After all the guests were already in the car, I <b>introduced</b> myself and <b>my</b> driver. After that, I explained about the schedule, regulation, and interesting object. Then, when we arrived in the tourism destinations, I gave explanation about the general information, entrance fee and meeting point of the tourism destination, and (3) Closing: I thanked and said goodbye to all <b>my</b> <b>guests</b> who joined Great Tour and Travel tour.
