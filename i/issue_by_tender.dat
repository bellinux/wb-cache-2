2500|$|Onslows [...] "safe to dive" [...] {{certificate}} ran {{out just}} after Christmas 1989. The Australian government had been trialling a program whereby refit work was tendered {{out to the}} private sector; delays in selecting the winning company and allocating the funds meant that an 18-month refit of the submarine scheduled to begin {{at the start of}} 1990 did not commence on time. Australian Defence Industries (ADI) was awarded the $100 million refit contract for Onslow and sister submarine [...] in July. Cockatoo Island's slave dock was transferred to the ADI facilities at Garden Island in November 1990, and was used for the refit. It was later found, during arbitration between the Australian Government and Cockatoo Island Dockyard for various <b>issues,</b> that <b>by</b> <b>tendering</b> out the submarine refits to other companies, the government was in breach of contract with the Dockyard; A$17.3 million in compensation was awarded to the dockyard in August 1996 for loss of profits and overhead costs.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an {{exploration}} of the ability of game theory to explain real-world corporate maneuvering. We explore this <b>issue</b> <b>by</b> investigating bond <b>tender</b> offers accompanied <b>by</b> a threat to call nontendered bonds, so called "Simultaneous Tender and Call" (STAC) offers. We argue that STACs engender a transparent game played by bondholders and shareholders. We model this game and use this model to predict the outcome of STACs. Finally, we investigate the issue of whether this theoretical model explains the outcomes of four actual STAC <b>issues</b> made <b>by</b> James River, May Department Stores, and Houston Lighting & Power Company. Our clinical analysis provides support for the explanatory power of our model. Calibrating the predictions of the model with data from these STACs, we demonstrate a correspondence between theory and actual corporate behavior. As predicted by our model, subgame perfection, or threat credibility, and preplay coordination are central to explaining the outcomes of the STACs...|$|R
40|$|JEL: C 19, C 20, L 22, R 40 International audienceThis paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} yardstick competition and Demsetz competition for western European railways. To that end {{it is necessary to}} compare the performance of various railways. Thus, {{in the first part of}} the paper we show that it is, to a certain extent, possible to take into account the various dimensions of performance with a frontier approach. Horizontal separation of formerly state-owned monopolies might lead to yardstick and Demsetz competition. We are addressing in the second part of the paper some of the major <b>issues</b> raised <b>by</b> competitive <b>tendering</b> in a horizontally separated railways network, namely vertical separation, optimal size, duration of the franchises, the sunk costs and the network externalities. Finally, we conclude that it is possible to compare the performance of different railways companies and that horizontal separation enable yardstick competition and Demsetz competition, even if some problems remain to be solved especially for the “core” of the systems...|$|R
