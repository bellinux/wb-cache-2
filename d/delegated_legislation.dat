5|$|These {{reforms were}} also {{significant}} {{in that they}} gave to Senate committees the role of examining the budget (what {{is referred to as}} the estimates process or estimates hearings), which had hitherto been confined to the Senate and its committee of the whole. The role of the committees was enhanced by three subsequent developments. First, in 1982 the Scrutiny of Bills Committee was established, which, in examining all bills, played a role that complemented that of the examination of all <b>delegated</b> <b>legislation</b> by the Regulations and Ordinances Committee. Second, in 1989 the Senate adopted procedures for the systematic referral of bills to committees, increasing the level of legislative scrutiny taking place within parliament. Third, in 1993, the committees adopted a more extensive procedure for consideration of the budget, creating a second opportunity each year for Senators to follow up issues identified during the initial budget estimates hearings. These second hearings are referred to as supplementary budget estimates. Though the committee system was restructured in 1994, 2006 and again in 2009, the range of functions has remained essentially the same.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{abolished}} {{any power}} of the House of Lords to veto any public Bill introduced in the House of Commons other than a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years or a Bill for confirming a Provisional Order.

The changes were debated by the Third <b>Delegated</b> <b>Legislation</b> Committee in January 2016, {{rather than in the}} Commons. The lack of a vote on the matter has drawn criticism, as by circumventing the Commons the measures [...] "automatically become law".

25|$|If the {{government}} {{agrees that the}} changes are worthwhile, a Bill is drafted, usually by Parliamentary Counsel. The Bill is read and debated {{in both houses of}} parliament before it is either rejected, changed, or approved. An approved Bill must then receive the assent then handed down to either the Governor (State) or the Governor-General (Commonwealth). And then it must be put to the people through a Referendum and only a majority vote of all the States will ensure that law will be passed. Parliament often <b>delegates</b> <b>legislation</b> to local councils, statutory authorities and government departments, for sub or minor statute laws or rules such as Road Rules, but all law is answerable to the Commonwealth Constitution.|$|R

500|$|The case, R (Bancoult) v Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, {{went to the}} Divisional Court, {{where it}} was heard by judges Richard Gibbs and John Laws. Bancoult's {{argument}} was made on several grounds: firstly, that the Crown could not exclude a British citizen from British territory, except in times of war, without a valid statutory basis or prerogative power. Secondly, the Chagossians had {{a constitutional right to}} inhabit their land under the Magna Carta, one which could not be abridged with <b>delegated</b> <b>legislation,</b> and third, the Commissioner of BIOT's duty to legislate [...] "for the peace, order and good government" [...] of BIOT's inhabitants could not be said to be fulfilled by relocating those inhabitants.|$|E
500|$|The {{case was}} {{heard in the}} Divisional Court by Lord Justice Kay and Mr Justice Collins in January 2005. In their judgment, {{they found that the}} {{legislation}} made using the 1911 Act could modify the Act, as indicated by the reference to [...] "any Public Bill" [...] being permitted to use the Parliament Acts (except for a limited number of express exceptions). Furthermore, they ruled that the 1911 Act did not create a method of making <b>delegated</b> <b>legislation,</b> but was instead a redefinition {{of the relationship between the}} House of Commons and the House of Lords. Moreover, there was found to be [...] "no established principle applicable to this case which denies a power of amendment of the earlier statute in the absence of the express conferral of one specifically dealing with amendment". The Parliament Act 1949 was therefore found to have been validly passed using the Parliament Act 1911 and the Hunting Act was consequently also held to be an Act of Parliament.|$|E
500|$|During {{the late}} 20th century {{there was a}} gradual [...] "retreat" [...] from this rule; in Sagnata Investments Ltd v Norwich Corporation, the courts allowed Hansard {{material}} to be submitted to determine the purpose of legislation (but not to interpret the statute), and in Pickstone v Freemans plc, it was allowed {{to assist in the}} understanding of <b>delegated</b> <b>legislation.</b> A noted attack on the rule was made by Lord Denning in Davis v Johnson, where he said that asserting that the courts could not use Hansard was similar to saying that the judges [...] "should grope about in the dark for the meaning of an Act without switching on the light. In some cases Parliament is assured in the most explicit terms what the effect of a statute will be. It is on that footing that members assent to the clause being agreed to. It is on that understanding that an amendment is not pressed. In such cases I think the court should {{be able to look at}} the proceedings." [...] Despite these exceptions, the courts regularly maintained that it was not possible to use internal Parliamentary discussions as an aid to legislative interpretation. The result of Pepper was a reversal of that rule; a court could use internal Parliamentary discussions where it was relevant to [...] "the very point in question in the litigation", where a piece of legislation is [...] "ambiguous or obscure, or the literal meaning of which leads to an absurdity", with the intention being to understand [...] "the mischief aimed at or the legislative intention lying behind the ambiguous or obscure words".|$|E

5000|$|The {{delegation}} of {{the imposition of}} a tax is constitutional if express and unambiguous language is used in making the delegation. The animating principle is that only the legislature can impose a new tax ab initio. But if the legislature expressly and clearly authorizes {{the imposition of a}} tax by a delegated body or individual, then the requirements of the principle of “no taxation without representation” will be met. In such a situation, the delegated authority is not being used to impose a completely new tax, but only to impose a tax that has been approved by the legislature. The democratic principle is thereby preserved in two ways. First, the <b>legislation</b> expressly <b>delegating</b> the imposition of a tax must be approved by the legislature. Second, the government enacting the <b>delegating</b> <b>legislation</b> remains ultimately accountable to the electorate at the next general election.|$|R
40|$|Multiple {{levels of}} rules {{regulate}} fisheries management: international agreements, state laws, <b>delegated</b> <b>legislations</b> and subnational acts. At all levels, policy decisions {{should be based}} on scientific knowledge, especially in fields like the environment and the management of natural resources, where ecological concerns need to be taken into account. Since the 1990 s, numerous international agreements have integrated science-based information and promoted a transition to a more responsible fisheries management. By contrast, national (and subnational) policy decisions cannot only be based on knowledge, but need to respond to constellations of political, administrative, and socio-economic actors in order to be perceived as legitimate and avoid conflicts. The paper analyzes the political uncertainty which accompanies the transition to more sustainable fisheries policies by highlighting the role of various actors in fisheries policy reforms. For this purpose, the paper traces the main conflicts affecting fisheries policy formation and implementation, under international agreements, in China and Senegal. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{provides a}} novel {{evaluation of the}} extent to which, and the conditions under which United States administrative agencies are able to push policy toward their preferences rather than being wholly faithful to their legislative principals, in ways that I refer to as noncompliance. I evaluate this bureaucratic behavior {{in the context of the}} Environmental Protection Agency and the Department of Interior from 1973 to 2010. I collected extensive original data on institutional responses to these agency actions, and using these new data found robust support for the core separation-of-powers hypotheses that legislative-executive conflict, polarization in Congress, and disagreement with the <b>delegating</b> <b>legislation</b> powerfully contribute to agencies stepping outside their discretionary windows rather than exercising regulatory compliance. To evaluate the policy consequences of this bureaucratic behavior with respect to policy volatility and long-term bureaucratic discretion to implement public policy, I created an additional original dataset of statutory amendments to the legislation under the jurisdiction of the Environmental Protection Agency. I find strong support for noncompliance in the prior period leading Congress to considerably revise agency discretion in the way of adding specificity to the texts or imposing additional oversight provisions that constrain agency actions moving forward. Thus, agencies' willingness to step outside of their discretionary windows so as to achieve shorter-term policy goals has important longer-term consequences with respect to their range of discretion and the scope of administrative capacity in a world of bureaucratic governance. The dissertation has broad implications for our understanding of the factors shaping de facto policy outcomes in a conflictual separation-of-powers setting, and the evolving scope of the American administrative state...|$|R

5000|$|Parliament {{often and}} {{increasingly}} confers powers {{on the executive}} to make <b>delegated</b> (or secondary) <b>legislation.</b> The purpose of such legislation is often practical - to enable ministers to make provision {{at a level of}} detail inappropriate for inclusion in the Act, or designed to meet changing circumstances. But the powers delegated can also be more substantial - enabling ministers to fill in large gaps left by so-called 'skeleton bills', or to amend and even repeal primary legislation ('Henry VIII powers'). Such enabling clauses in bills remove legislation from detailed parliamentary scrutiny.|$|R
