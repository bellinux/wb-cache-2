5|$|Unlike animals, plants lack {{phagocytic}} cells, {{but many}} plant immune responses involve systemic chemical signals that are sent through a plant. Individual plant cells respond to molecules associated with pathogens known as Pathogen-associated molecular patterns or PAMPs. When {{a part of}} a plant becomes infected, the plant produces a localized <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>response,</b> whereby cells at the site of infection undergo rapid apoptosis {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant. Systemic acquired resistance (SAR) is a type of defensive response used by plants that renders the entire plant resistant to a particular infectious agent.

25|$|Most plant immune {{responses}} involve systemic chemical signals sent {{throughout a}} plant. Plants use pattern-recognition receptors to recognize conserved microbial signatures. This recognition triggers an immune response. The first plant receptors of conserved microbial signatures {{were identified in}} rice (XA21, 1995) and in Arabidopsis (FLS2, 2000). Plants also carry immune receptors that recognize highly variable pathogen effectors. These include the NBS-LRR class of proteins. When {{a part of a}} plant becomes infected with a microbial or viral pathogen, in case of an incompatible interaction triggered by specific elicitors, the plant produces a localized <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>response</b> (HR), in which cells at the site of infection undergo rapid programmed cell death {{to prevent the spread of}} the disease to other parts of the plant.

500|$|Reactive oxygen species, such as {{superoxide}} ion (...) {{and hydrogen}} peroxide (...) , are reactive by-products of oxygen use in organisms.

2500|$|The <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>response</b> (HR) is a mechanism, used by plants, {{to prevent}} the spread of {{infection}} by microbial pathogens. [...] The HR is characterized by the rapid death of cells in the local region surrounding an infection. The HR serves to restrict the growth and spread of pathogens to other parts of the plant. The HR is analogous to the innate immune system found in animals, and commonly precedes a slower systemic (whole plant) response, which ultimately leads to systemic acquired resistance (SAR).|$|E
2500|$|Parts of {{the immune}} system of higher organisms, however, create peroxide, superoxide, and singlet oxygen to destroy invading microbes. Recently, singlet oxygen {{has been found to be}} a source of biologically-produced ozone: This {{reaction}} proceeds through an unusual compound dihydrogen trioxide, also known as trioxidane, (HOOOH), which is an antibody-catalyzed product of singlet oxygen and water. This compound, in turn, disproportionates to ozone and peroxide, providing two powerful antibacterials.

2500|$|PTI is able {{to combat}} {{pathogens}} in a nonspecific manner. [...] A stronger and more specific response in plants is that of effector-triggered immunity (ETI). [...] ETI is dependent upon the recognition of pathogen effectors, proteins secreted by the pathogen that alter functions in the host, [...] by plant resistance genes (R-genes), often described as a gene-for-gene relationship. [...] This recognition may occur directly or indirectly via a guardee protein in a hypothesis known as the guard hypothesis.

2500|$|In {{response}} to parasitic attack, plants undergo {{a series of}} metabolic and biochemical reaction pathways that enact defensive responses. For example, parasitic invasion causes {{an increase in the}} jasmonic acid-insensitive (JA) and NahG (SA) pathway. These pathways produce chemicals that induce defensive responses, such as the production of chemicals or defensive molecules to fight off the attack. Different biochemical pathways are activated by different parasites. In general, {{there are two types of}} responses that can be activated by the pathways. Plants can either initiate a specific or non-specific response. Specific responses involve gene-gene recognition of the plant and parasite. This can be mediated by the ability of the plant’s cell receptors recognizing and binding molecules that are located on the cell surface of parasites. Once the plant’s receptors recognizes the parasite, the plant localizes the defensive compounds to that area creating a <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>response.</b> This form of defense mechanism localizes the area of attack and keeps the parasite from spreading. Furthermore, a specific response against parasitic attack prevents the plants from wasting its energy by increasing defenses where it is not needed. [...] However, specific defensive responses only target specific parasites. If the plant lacks the ability to recognize a parasite, specific defense responses are not activated. Nonspecific defensive responses work against all parasites. These responses are active over time and are systematic, meaning that the responses are not confined to an area of the plant, but rather spread throughout the entirety of the organism. However, nonspecific responses are energy costly, since the plant has to ensure that the genes producing the nonspecific responses are always expressed.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Tobacco etch potyvirus (TEV) {{has been}} {{extensively}} used as model system {{for the study of}} positive-sense RNA virus infecting plants. TEV ability to infect Arabidopsis thaliana varies among ecotypes. In this study, changes in gene expression of A. thaliana ecotype L er infected with TEV have been explored using long-oligonucleotide arrays. A. thaliana L er is a susceptible host that allows systemic movement, although the viral load is low and syndrome induced ranges from asymptomatic to mild. Gene expression profiles were monitored in whole plants 21 days post-inoculation (dpi). Microarrays contained 26, 173 protein-coding genes and 87 miRNAs. Results Expression analysis identified 1727 genes that displayed significant and consistent changes in expression levels either up or down, in infected plants. Identified TEV-responsive genes encode a diverse array of functional categories that include responses to biotic (such as the systemic acquired resistance pathway and <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses)</b> and abiotic stresses (droughtness, salinity, temperature, and wounding). The expression of many different transcription factors was also significantly affected, including members of the R 2 R 3 -MYB family and ABA-inducible TFs. In concordance with several other plant and animal viruses, the expression of heat-shock proteins (HSP) was also increased. Finally, we have associated functional GO categories with KEGG biochemical pathways, and found that many of the altered biological functions are controlled by changes in basal metabolism. Conclusion TEV infection significantly impacts a wide array of cellular processes, in particular, stress-response pathways, including the systemic acquired resistance and <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses.</b> However, many of the observed alterations may represent a global response to viral infection rather than being specific of TEV. </p...|$|R

The model {{was used to assess}} time course and efficacy of a replication defective herpes simplex virus type 1 vector construct delivering human cDNA encoding preproenkephalin (HSV-ENK). Results Most surprising was the relative lack of inflammation and tissue disruption after HSV-ENK treatment compared to the histopathology consistent with pancreatitis (inflammatory cell infiltration, edema, acinar cell hypertrophy, fibrosis) present {{as a result of the}} high-fat and alcohol diet in controls. The HSV-ENK vector delivered to the pancreatic surface at week 3 reversed pancreatitis-associated hotplate <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses</b> for 4 – 6 weeks, while control virus encoding β-galactosidase cDNA (HSV-β-gal) had no effect. Increased Fos expression seen bilaterally in pain processing regions in control animals with pancreatitis was absent in HSV-ENK-treated animals.

30|$|Phenotypic {{analyses}} of Atg 7 mutants indicates that Atg 7 disruption renders Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) cells hypersensitive to {{a shortage of}} nutrients with features of premature leaf senescence, though the mutant is otherwise normal (Doelling et al., 2002). Increased expression of multiple LC 3 isoforms are observed in Atg 7 mutants due to impaired control of the two ubiquitin-like conjugation systems of LC 3 and Atg 12 (Thompson et al., 2005). Deletion of Atg 7 in Nicotiana benthamiana and Arabidopsis leads to unrestricted <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses</b> during plant innate immunity (Liu et al., 2005; Hofius et al., 2009). Arabidopsis Atg 7 mutant is also more susceptible to fungal infection (Lenz et al., 2011).

40|$|In {{transgenic}} tobacco {{plants with}} reduced catalase activity, {{high levels of}} hydrogen peroxide (H- 2 O- 2) can accumulate under photorespiratory conditions.

Ultrastructural alterations, such as chromatin condensation and disruption of mitochondrial integrity, took place before cell death. Furthermore, enhanced transcript levels of mitochondrial defense genes accompanied these mitochondrial changes. Pharmacological data indicated that the initiation and execution of cell death require de novo protein synthesis and that the signal transduction pathway leading to cell death involved changes in ion homeostasis, (de) phosphorylation events and an oxidative burst, as observed during <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses.</b> This oxidase-dependent oxidative burst is essential for cell death, {{but it is not}} required for the accumulation of defense proteins, suggesting a more prominent role for the oxidative burst in abiotic stress-induced cell death...|$|R
40|$|SummaryPrevious {{work has}} {{identified}} alterations in histone acetylation in animal models of drug addiction and depression. However, the mechanisms which integrate drugs and stress {{with changes in}} chromatin structure remain unclear.

Chronic, but not acute, exposure to cocaine or stress decreases HDAC 5 function in the nucleus accumbens (NAc), a major brain reward region, which allows for increased histone acetylation and transcription of HDAC 5 target genes. This regulation is behaviorally important, as loss of HDAC 5  causes <b>hypersensitive</b> <b>responses</b> to chronic, not acute, cocaine or stress.
