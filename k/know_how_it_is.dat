You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> between Poles and Germans. But Bach was a German too—and Schubert, and Strauss. Everyone has his place on this little earth. That's all behind me. So the Third Symphony is not about war; it's not a Dies Irae; it's a normal Symphony of Sorrowful Songs." ...|$|E

Appearances included Ready Steady Cook, Blue Peter, the BBC News Channel, Sky News Sunrise, The Alan Titchmarsh Show and The Paul O'Grady Show. Speaking about the album's promotion, Smith said [...] "t is always a struggle when a second album comes out because you never <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to do but fingers crossed people will enjoy it. I am very proud of it. ... I am excited about going on all the shows too – especially Ready Steady Cook because I can't cook and I think it will be fun." ...|$|E
500|$|Cisneros {{explores the}} issue of place in {{relation}} not only to gender but also to class. As Saldívar has noted, [...] "Aside from the personal requirement of a gendered woman's space, Esperanza recognizes the collective requirements of the working poor and the homeless as well." [...] He refers to Esperanza's determination not to forget her working-class roots once she obtains her dream house, and to open her doors {{to those who are}} less fortunate. Esperanza says [...] "Passing bums will ask, Can I come in? I'll offer them the attic, ask them to stay, because I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> to be without a house." [...] According to Saldívar, this statement of Esperanza's alludes to [...] "the necessity for a decent living space" [...] that is fundamental to all people, despite the different oppressions they face.|$|E

500|$|According to author Thomas Telfer, by {{the turn}} of the 1970s, the town of Gateshead was {{suffering}} from [...] "the classic symptoms of decay in its inner-city areas". The response during the 1960s had been a programme of systematic derelict land reclamation and environmental improvement. While these measures did not have an immediate positive impact on the perception of the town, Gateshead Council pressed ahead by looking to develop existing infrastructure with a view to overall regeneration. One such opportunity was identified at the Gateshead Youth Stadium, where the council believed that investment might raise the region's profile and bring international recognition. In April 1974, Gateshead Council inaugurated a [...] "Sport and Recreation" [...] department. In July 1974, the council appointed Brendan Foster—a former schoolteacher turned athlete and a native of Tyne and Wear—as the Council's sport and recreation manager. Foster, who according to Gibson became [...] "the father of Gateshead athletics", had been forced to train in Edinburgh during 1973 as a result of the poor condition of the Youth Stadium track. In December 1973, he had been invited to a civic reception to celebrate his breaking of the two-mile world record earlier that year at Crystal Palace. At this reception, Foster was told that a new synthetic track was being laid at Gateshead Youth Stadium. His response was a promise that, if the Council was serious, he would run at the stadium and break a world record (Foster later offered an explanation of that promise: [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> when you've had a few drinksyou promise the world!"). When the track was laid in early1974, Foster became convinced of the Council's sincerity. He was interviewed for the managerial position and, upon appointment, became the [...] "driving force" [...] behind the programme of improvements to the Youth Stadium, which included the building of the main, covered Tyne and Wear stand in 1981 and three accompanying stands; the venue was renamed the Gateshead International Stadium. This first tranche of improvements cost around £8million, and Foster's proposal to commemorate the re-opening with an athletic event was approved, allowing for the first [...] "Gateshead Games" [...] to be held in 1974.|$|E
2500|$|The {{figure had}} {{walked away from}} them to a {{distance}} of about 120ft (36.5 m) before Patterson began to run after it. The resulting film (about 59.5 seconds long at 16 fps) is initially quite shaky until Patterson got about 80ft (24.4 m) from the figure. At that point, the figure glanced over its right shoulder at the men and Patterson fell to his knees; on Krantz's map this corresponds to frame 264. To researcher John Green, Patterson would later characterize the creature's expression as one of [...] "contempt and disgust...you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> when the umpire tells you 'one more word and you're out of the game.' That's the way it felt." ...|$|E
2500|$|After the game, the umpire, Hoagland of Princeton, praised Michigan's {{blocking}} (then {{known as}} interference): [...] "If {{you can tell}} me how you are going to break such a perfect interference, four men running ahead of the man with the ball on end runs without allowing Michigan to make a score, I would like to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> done." [...] Michigan's trainer, Keene Fitzpatrick, filled in for Yost as the on-field coach against Iowa. After the game, Fitzpatrick noted:"I think our team-work today was fine. The men certainly have the right spirit. Coach Yost hated to go away. ... The last thing he said to me was, 'Keene, just before they go into the game, give them a good talk.' Well, I guess they did, and I am proud of them." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{episode was}} {{originally}} written for Matt Smith's Eleventh Doctor. [...] An early working {{title for the}} episode was [...] "Return to Sarn", however, this {{was intended to be}} misleading. [...] While briefing Harness on how to write the script, executive producer Steven Moffat told him to [...] "Hinchcliffe [...] the shit out of it for the first half", meaning, essentially, to make it frightening. [...] This was in reference to Philip Hinchcliffe, who produced Doctor Who from 1974–77, a period known as especially frightening during the classic series. [...] Moffat called the script [...] "intense and emotional". [...] Harness has said that the episode will see a large change for the show. [...] "I still don’t know how people will take it. [...] I’m in this kind of limbo now waiting for people to see it, and I’ve no idea, really I do not <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>it</b> <b>is</b> going to go down." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2009, a {{spokesperson}} for Lopez told People magazine that Lopez was not replacing Paula Abdul on the eighth season of American Idol because she would be busy promoting her film, The Back-up Plan {{as well as her}} new album. Both projects were slated for a January 2010 release, despite Lopez previously stating that she was aiming for the end of 2009. However during an interview with KTU Mornings, Lopez revealed that both the album and film were being pushed back to April 2010. Rap-Up magazine would later confirm that the album and film were being released together in cross-promotion of each other. However this date appeared unlikely when, backstage at the 52nd Grammy Awards ceremony, she said [...] "I'm working on my album that will be out... hopefully this year, we'll see if I get it done...
