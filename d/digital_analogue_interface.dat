Todays most forward architects and designer {{are aware of}} this and make full use of physical and digital media {{during the process of}} design. During the summer term 2004 the experiment Crossing the Media took place at the Technical University of Braunschweig. The main goal of this practical oriented seminar has been the exploration of the <b>interface</b> between <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> Media within the design process. Both techniques, <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital,</b> were used in an experimental way and their interaction and adaptability in the field of architecture was analyzed. The work examines the possibility of a consistent integration of digital and physical representation in a design process and the individual benefits of each. In order to achieve this, we made up a stringent line of digital-analogue and analogue-digital (DA-AD) Technologies for our design experiment. During the examination we focused especially on the creative potential of the techniques used, their interaction and adaptability in the field of architecture. Hence {{one of the goals of}} the occupation with the <b>digital</b> <b>analogue</b> <b>interfaces</b> was the examination of the emerging shift within the structure during the process, the imprints of technology. This paper describes the workflow and tools that were used, our practical experiences with <b>analogue</b> <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> and the emerging questions and impulses to architects future work and theory. The discovered limitations and consequences of <b>interfaces</b> between the <b>analogue</b> and <b>digital</b> realm of design and their creative chances will be revealed. We share results which we think are helpful to others, and we highlight areas where further research is necessary...|$|R

Therefore, learning institutions are continuously improving their courses in microcontroller and embedded system programming. Although {{the diversity of}} curriculums, the availability of learning tools, where the student can practice and improve their skills, is a key factor {{to the success of}} the learning process. The platform developed and presented in this paper results from author’s experience in teaching embedded systems. From the analysis of teaching/learning needs, a learning environment based on the Freescale HC 11, MCS 51, and Microchip PIC 16 Series families was designed. This tool can be expanded by modules and adjusted, at a specific time, to student's real needs. All modules can be interconnected by an IDE bus, allowing expanding the capabilities of the platform.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an approach to}} modelling distributed systems described by Partial Differential Equations(PDEs) in SystemC-A. Such modeling approach is quite important because of the modeling difficulties for the mixedphysical domain systems where complex <b>digital</b> and <b>analogue</b> electronics <b>interfaces</b> with vital distributed physical effects. As current SystemC-A does not support PDEs modeling, the proposed approach is based on discretization of PDEs {{to a set of}} Ordinary Differential and Algebraic Equations(ODAEs) which can be solved. This work is the preliminary step of syntax extensions to SystemC-A to support AMS systems modeling with PDEs. Distributed lossy microstrip and cantilever beam are used to validate the method and are described in the case studies...|$|R
50|$|A {{water bath}} is {{laboratory}} equipment {{made from a}} container filled with heated water. It is used to incubate samples in water at a constant temperature {{over a long period}} of time. All water baths have a <b>digital</b> or an <b>analogue</b> <b>interface</b> to allow users to set a desired temperature. Utilisations include warming of reagents, melting of substrates or incubation of cell cultures. It is also used to enable certain chemical reactions to occur at high temperature. Water bath is a preferred heat source for heating flammable chemicals instead of an open flame to prevent ignition. Different types of water baths are used depending on application. For all water baths, it can be used up to 99.9 °C. When temperature is above 100 °C, alternative methods such as oil bath, silicone bath or sand bath may be used.|$|R

The interface makes use of the link ports, which are standard features of general-purpose digital signal processor (DSP). Hence the interface {{can be used for}} the different DSPs with minimum customisation. Current technologies for video processing are either based on applicationspeci®c integrated circuit (ASIC) or programmable processors specialised for video or video DSP as well as a hybrid of the above with a host computer. Such technologies come equip with software tools and application programming interfaces (APIs) to support a variety of common video processing tasks. Some of these may have support for <b>analogue</b> video <b>interfaces</b> while others simply cater only to digital video inputs/ outputs. Unfortunately, the majority of video sources in daily life are analogue in nature. Video application designers are thus faced with the problem of ®nding a suitable simple <b>analogue</b> video <b>interface</b> for their applications. Moreover, for those designers who design their own video processing algorithms using general-purpose DSP to circumvent the cost and limitations imposed by these suites of standard solutions, the need for a simple <b>analogue</b> video <b>interface</b> is further underscored.
