5|$|Fourier {{series are}} used to solve {{boundary}} value problems in partial differential equations. In 1822, Fourier first used this technique to solve the heat equation. A discrete version of the Fourier series {{can be used in}} sampling applications where the function value is known only at a finite number of equally spaced points. In this case the Fourier series is finite and its value is equal to the sampled values at all points. The set of coefficients is known as the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of the given sample sequence. The DFT {{is one of the key}} tools of digital signal processing, a field whose applications include radar, speech encoding, image compression. The JPEG <b>image</b> <b>format</b> is an application of the closely related discrete cosine transform.|$|E

25|$|JPEG {{compression}} {{is used in}} {{a number}} of image file formats. JPEG/Exif is the most common <b>image</b> <b>format</b> used by digital cameras and other photographic image capture devices; along with JPEG/JFIF, it is the most common format for storing and transmitting photographic images on the World Wide Web. These format variations are often not distinguished, and are simply called JPEG.|$|E

25|$|High-dynamic-range {{photographs}} are generally achieved by capturing multiple standard-exposure images, often using exposure bracketing, {{and then later}} merging them into a single HDR image, usually within a photo manipulation program). Digital images are often encoded in a camera's raw <b>image</b> <b>format,</b> because 8-bit JPEG encoding does not offer a wide enough range of values to allow fine transitions (and regarding HDR, later introduces undesirable effects due to lossy compression).|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, JPEG {{may not be}} as well suited for line {{drawings}} and other textual or iconic graphics, where the sharp contrasts between adjacent pixels can cause noticeable artifacts. Such images may be better saved in a lossless graphics format such as TIFF, GIF, PNG, or a raw <b>image</b> <b>format.</b> The JPEG standard actually includes a lossless coding mode, but that mode is not supported in most products.|$|E
25|$|CompuServe {{introduced}} GIF on June 15, 1987 {{to provide}} a color <b>image</b> <b>format</b> for their file downloading areas, replacing their earlier run-length encoding (RLE) format, which was black and white only. GIF became popular because it used LZW data compression, which was more efficient than the run-length encoding that formats such as PCX and MacPaint used, and fairly large images could therefore be downloaded in a reasonably short time, even with very slow modems.|$|E

25|$|Windows Photo Gallery is a {{photo and}} video library {{management}} application. It can import from digital cameras, tag and rate individual pictures including custom metadata {{based on the}} Extensible Metadata Platform. It also allows basic editing of images, such as adjusting color and exposure, resizing, cropping, red-eye reduction and printing. Slideshows, with pan, fade and other effects, can also be created, and burnt to DVD. It allows custom metadata {{to be added to}} images and videos, and enables searching by the attributes. It also supports raw <b>image</b> <b>format</b> natively and can open and organize any <b>image</b> <b>format</b> for which image codecs are installed in the Windows Imaging Component. Images and videos may be viewed in the Windows Photo Gallery Viewer with options to zoom, pan and losslessly rotate images, pause or play videos, and bring up the Info pane to view and edit metadata about a photo or video. ICC V4 color profiles embedded in images are also supported. The Photo Print Wizard has been improved to offer a lot of customizability. An upgraded version of this, Windows Live Photo Gallery allows you to upload and share photos and videos online as part of Windows Live services.|$|E
25|$|In June 2013, Ucamco {{published}} {{a proposal to}} add three new commands to the Gerber format which allow to include image attributes conveying metadata attached to the image and its components. It invited feedback from the Gerber users before committing these ideas to a firm specification. This process resulted in revision J1 from February 2014, updated with further revisions until revision 2015.07. Including metadata adds intelligence to the format. It converts a mere image description format to a fully-fledged PCB data transfer format. This is called the second extension and results {{what is known as}} Gerber X2, Gerber X1 being the pure <b>image</b> <b>format.</b> Gerber X2 is fully backward compatible with X1 - the attributes do not affect the image. Gerber X2 was developed by Karel Tavernier, Ludek Brukner and Thomas Weyn.|$|E
