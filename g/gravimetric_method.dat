It has already been proven that the correlation curve for quantification is species dependent, but it has not yet been investigated whether this is also the case for the optimization of the Nile Red assay protocol. Therefore, two autotrophic, marine microalgae, Nannochloropsis oculata and T-Isochrysis lutea, strongly differing in e. g. cell wall structure, were selected in this study to investigatewhether optimization of the Nile Red assay is species dependent. Besides this, it was checked for one of these species, Nannochloropsis, whether the lipid content, determined by the Nile Red assay, could indeed be correlated with the neutral and/or total lipid content determined by <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods.</b> Itwas found that optimization of the Nile Red assay was strongly species dependent. Consequently, optimization has to be done for each species before using the assay.

This method is more expensive than the more common <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method,</b> given the cost of the colored reagents, and is recommended when optimal accuracy is required. It is also recommended for extremely low-volume pipette calibration, in the 2 microliter range, because the inherent uncertainties of the gravimetic method, performed with standard laboratory balances, becomes excessive. Properly calibrated microbalances, capable of reading in the range of micrograms (10−6 g) can also be used effectively for gravimetric analysis of low-volume micropipettes, but only if environmental conditions are under strict control. Six-place balances and environmental controls dramatically increase the cost of such calibrations.|$|E

The lignin content was evaluated by five methods: cellulose solubilization in sulfuric acid [Lignin (sa) ], oxidation with potassium permanganate [Lignin (pm) ], the Klason lignin method (KL), solubilization in acetyl bromide from acid detergent fiber (ABLadf) and solubilization in acetyl bromide from the cell wall (ABLcw). Samples from ten grasses and ten legumes were used. The lignin content values obtained by <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> were also corrected for protein contamination, and the corrected values were referred to as Lignin (sa) p, Lignin (pm) p and KLp. The indigestible fraction of NDF (iNDF), the discrete lag (LAG) and the fractional rate of degradation (kd) of NDF were estimated using an in vitro assay. Correcting for protein resulted in reductions (P 0. 05) {{with all of the}} NDF degradation parameters. However, the strongest correlation coefficients for all methods evaluated were obtained with Lignin (pm) p and KLp. The lignin content estimated by the ABLcw method did not correlate (P> 0. 05) with any parameters of NDF degradation. There was a correlation (P< 0. 05) between the lignin content estimated by the ABLadf method and iNDF content.

40|$|Simulation of wear in {{artificial}} joint implants {{is critical}} for evaluating implant designs and materials. Traditional protocols employ the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> to determine the loss of material by measuring {{the weight of the}} implant components before and after various test intervals and after the completed test. However, the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> cannot identify the location, area coverage or maximum depth of the wear and it has difficulties with proportionally small weight changes in relatively heavy implants. In this study, we compare the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> with two geometric surface methods; an optical light method (RedLux) and a coordinate measuring method (CMM). We tested ten Adept hips in a simulator for 2 million cycles (MC). Gravimetric and optical methods were performed at 0. 33, 0. 66, 1. 00, 1. 33 and 2 MC. CMM measurements were done before and after the test. A high correlation was found between the gravimetric and optical methods for both heads (R 2 = 0. 997) and for cups (R 2 = 0. 96). Both geometric methods (optical and CMM) measured more volume loss than the <b>gravimetric</b> <b>method</b> (for the heads, p = 0. 004 (optical) and p = 0. 08 (CMM); for the cups p = 0. 01 (optical) and p = 0. 003 (CMM)).

40|$|We {{describe}} <b>gravimetric</b> <b>methods</b> {{for measuring}} the mass of droplets generated by a drop-on-demand (DOD) microdispenser. Droplets are deposited, either continuously at a known frequency or as a burst of known number, into a cylinder positioned on a submicrogram balance. Mass measurements are acquired precisely by computer, and results are corrected for evaporation. Capabilities are demonstrated using isobutyl alcohol droplets. For ejection rates greater than 100 Hz, the repeatability of droplet mass measurements was 0. 2 %, while the combined relative standard uncertainty (uc) was 0. 9 %. When bursts of droplets were dispensed, the limit of quantitation was 72 μg (1490 droplets) with uc = 1. 0 %. Individual droplet size in a burst was evaluated by high-speed videography. Diameters were consistent from the tenth droplet onward, and the mass of an individual droplet was best estimated by the average droplet mass with a combined uncertainty of about 1 %. Diameters of the first several droplets were anomalous, but their contribution was accounted for when dispensing bursts.
