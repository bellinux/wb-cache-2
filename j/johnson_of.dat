5|$|Following {{the custom}} of the times—that {{candidates}} not appear to seek the office—Tyler stayed home throughout the campaign, and made no speeches.

Harrison was the leading Whig candidate for president, but he lost to Van Buren.

5|$|His season's best {{came under}} unusual {{circumstances}} at the British Grand Prix – {{due to a}} system malfunction he was initially timed by hand at dead on ten seconds, which was amended to 9.96s after video evidence was consulted.

Chambers squandered his anchoring lead in the 4×100m relay, allowing Joshua J. <b>Johnson</b> <b>of</b> the United States team to beat him to the finish line. In spite of his close fourth and a relay silver medal, {{there was a sense of}} disappointment in the press that Chambers' record breaking claims and gold medals had not materialised.|$|E
