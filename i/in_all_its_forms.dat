5|$|Sultan Hamud was {{loyal to}} the British and acted as a figurehead for an {{essentially}} British-run government, the sultanate only being retained to avoid the costs involved with running Zanzibar directly as a crown colony. Several months after the war, Hamud, with British prompting, abolished slavery <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>forms.</b> The emancipation of slaves required them to present themselves to a government office and proved a slow process—within ten years only 17,293 slaves had been freed, from an estimated population of 60,000 in 1891.|$|E

40|$|When Filippo Marinetti {{published}} the manifesto for the Futurist {{movement on the}} front page of Le Figaro on the 20 th February 1909, it signalled, perhaps, not only the first salvo across the bows of traditional ways, but some would say a torpedo into the hull that would eventually allow outdated views and movements to sink without a trace.

A liberal regime came to power in Italy, and ended the secular power of the popes. The Vatican, however, launched a counter crusade against liberalism. Pope Pius IX issued the Syllabus of Errors in 1864, condemning liberalism <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>its</b> <b>forms.</b> In many countries, liberal forces responded by expelling the Jesuit order.|$|E
