5|$|In 1986, the Cabinet Committee on Political Affairs (CCPA) {{approved}} a <b>follow-on</b> {{class of the}} earlier Project 15 Delhi-class destroyers. The aim was that the <b>follow-on</b> class would incorporate {{a higher level of}} air-defence, land attack, anti-submarine and anti-ship capabilities than the preceding class. However, the Indian Navy did not initially take up the option. By the year 2000, the Indian Navy had redesigned the <b>follow-on</b> Kolkata class to incorporate even higher levels of technology (including modern stealth characteristics) and in May of that year, approval for the construction was given. Concept and function for Project 15A was framed by the navy's Directorate of Naval Design, while the detailed design was developed by Mazagon Dock Limited (MDL).|$|E
5|$|In May 2009, the {{schedule}} for Tukwila, its <b>follow-on,</b> was revised again, with release to OEMs {{planned for the}} first quarter of 2010.|$|E
5|$|The Itanium 9500 series {{processor}}, codenamed Poulson, is the <b>follow-on</b> processor to Tukwila and {{was released}} on November 8, 2012.|$|E
50|$|These systems {{followed}} the IBM 3090, with {{over a decade}} of <b>follow-ons,</b> eventually leading to the IBM System z.|$|R
50|$|The paper {{became a}} classic of {{mathematical}} humor and spawned various <b>follow-ons</b> {{over the years}} with theories or methods from other scientific areas adapted to hunting lions.|$|R
50|$|The XFP {{packaging}} {{was smaller}} than the XENPAK form-factor which had been published earlier (by almost a year).Some vendors supported both, or the XENPAK <b>follow-ons</b> called XPAK and X2.|$|R
5|$|Two {{improved}} Sea Kings {{were sold}} to the Royal Australian Navy {{as part of a}} <b>follow-on</b> order in 1981.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} Nike-X concept was canceled, {{some of its}} components were built and tested both as part of Nike-X and the <b>follow-on</b> Sentinel. MAR, MSR, Sprint and Spartan were the main programs during the Nike-X period.|$|E
5|$|As a <b>follow-on</b> to the Nilgiris, India {{commenced}} {{development of}} a new frigate, based on the Leander/Nilgiri, but larger. The resultant , also known as Project 16, could operate two Sea Kings simultaneously.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1883 season Richardson took {{at least}} one wicket in every innings except one, {{although}} with frequent <b>follow-ons</b> there was often only one chance to bowl. His batting contribution remained low.|$|R
25|$|While {{moderately}} successful, {{these early}} systems were large and extremely heavy; {{the one in}} the Saint-Chamond added five tons. The other designs, and <b>follow-ons</b> using a similar system, were generally dismissed as impractical.|$|R
50|$|Other large {{companies}} designed the 68020 and <b>follow-ons</b> into embedded equipment. At one point, {{there were more}} 68020s in embedded equipment than there were Intel Pentiums in PCs. The ColdFire processor cores are derivatives of the 68020.|$|R
5|$|In May 1967, {{participants}} from six councils met at Mortimer L. Schiff Scout Reservation in New Jersey to train {{to prepare the}} new course and <b>follow-on</b> courses. The first laboratory test was during June 1967. Participants from five councils delivered the June course and <b>follow-on</b> council courses. The councils represented were Del-Mar-Va Council in Wilmington, Delaware; Baltimore Area Council in Baltimore, Maryland; Valley Forge Council in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Onondaga Council in Syracuse, New York; and the National Capital Area Council in Washington, D.C.|$|E
5|$|Revenue {{department}} special intelligence agent Clarence L. Converse {{had observed}} the entire trial {{with an eye}} towards a <b>follow-on</b> tax prosecution. On June 3, Judge Philip Leo Sullivan sentenced three of the government witnesses in the trial to probation.|$|E
5|$|The {{critical}} Mach {{number of}} the Spitfire's original elliptical wing was higher than the subsequently used laminar-flow-section, straight-tapering-planform wing of the <b>follow-on</b> Supermarine Spiteful, Seafang and Attacker, illustrating that Reginald Mitchell's practical engineering approach {{to the problems of}} high-speed flight had paid off.|$|E
50|$|ASN-216 UAV and its <b>follow-ons</b> are Chinese UAVs {{developed}} by Xi'an Aisheng Technology Group Co., Ltd (西安爱生技术集团公司) ASN Technology Group Co., Ltd (西安爱生技术集团公司), {{also known as}} Northwestern Polytechnical University UAV Research Institute or 365th Institute, established in 1984.|$|R
50|$|EXCP {{may also}} be used to access {{communications}} devices attached to IBM 2701, 2702 and 2703 communications controllers and IBM 370x or Amdahl 470x front-end processors (and their respective <b>follow-ons)</b> operating in emulator mode (EP) or partitioned emulator mode (PEP).|$|R
50|$|From February 1988 to October 1990, Robert E. Cousins was the Department Manager for {{workstation}} development. During {{this time}} they produced the Maverick project and several <b>follow-ons</b> including the 300, 310 and 400 series workstations along with the 4000 series servers.|$|R
5|$|The destroyers are a <b>follow-on</b> of the Project 15 s, but are {{considerably}} more capable due to major {{improvements in the}} design, the addition of substantial land-attack capabilities, and the fitting-out of modern sensors and weapons systems.|$|E
5|$|After adding 48 in Australia's first {{innings of}} 411, Brown scored 133 {{in the second}} innings of the First Test at Nottingham after the {{tourists}} were forced to <b>follow-on,</b> helping Bradman (144 not out) to save the Test. The Australians reached 6/427 in the second innings when the match ended in the draw.|$|E
5|$|Begin the phased {{redeployment}} of U.S. {{forces in}} 2007 and withdraw {{most of them}} by 2008, leaving a small <b>follow-on</b> force for security and policing actions. The plan named as The Biden-Brownback Resolution passed on the Senate floor 75–23 on September 25, 2007, including 26 Republican votes.|$|E
50|$|ASN-9 UAV and its {{derivative}} and <b>follow-ons</b> are Chinese UAVs {{developed by}} Xi'an Aisheng Technology Group Co., Ltd (西安爱生技术集团公司) ASN Technology Group Co., Ltd (西安爱生技术集团公司), {{also known as}} Northwestern Polytechnical University UAV Research Institute or 365th Institute http://aisheng.nwpu.edu.cn/, established in 1984.|$|R
25|$|During the 1986 {{approach}} of Halley's Comet, international space probes {{were sent to}} explore the comet, most prominent among them being ESA's Giotto. After the probes returned valuable scientific information, {{it became obvious that}} <b>follow-ons</b> were needed that would shed more light on cometary composition and answer new questions.|$|R
50|$|The MK9 Corvette {{was ordered}} by the Nigerian Navy in April 1975 as <b>follow-ons</b> to the smaller Vosper Thornycroft MK3, which was confusedly grouped under the same Hippo class designation, both ships being named after the word for {{hippopotamus}} in local languages. The two ships were built by Vosper Thornycroft.|$|R
5|$|The {{results of}} the Bold Orion project, along with those from the testing of the High Virgo missile, also {{developed}} under WS-199, provided data and knowledge that assisted the Air Force in forming the requirements for the <b>follow-on</b> WS-138A, which would produce the GAM-87 Skybolt missile.|$|E
5|$|About an {{hour after}} Saratoga {{launched}} her airstrike, the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers. Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros. Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkakus Zeros stayed behind {{to deal with the}} Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku. The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros, but their spot report was garbled and the enemy's location could not be understood. This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a <b>follow-on</b> airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros.|$|E
5|$|As {{they were}} playing a four-man bowling attack, and had spent longer in the field than they had wanted, England opted not to enforce the <b>follow-on.</b> Batting again, England pressed to score quickly, but were pegged back by regular dismissals: no batsman scored more than 40 runs, and the run rate was {{much the same as}} their first innings. Shakib Al Hasan claimed four wickets, and England batting 50 minutes into the fourth morning before declaring on 209 for 7, leaving Bangladesh {{requiring}} 513 runs in their second innings to win.|$|E
5000|$|Both the Air Force and the Navy {{had been}} {{developing}} plans for operational <b>follow-ons</b> {{to their respective}} demonstrator programs, but pressures rose for the two services to merge their efforts, resulting {{in the formation of}} the [...] "Joint Unmanned Combat Air System (J-UCAS)" [...] program in October 2003 under DARPA direction.|$|R
50|$|During the 1894 season, Young {{appeared}} in two matches {{which were not}} part of the County Championship but qualified as first-class matches. These were against Yorkshire and Leicestershire and Derbyshire won both through <b>follow-ons.</b> As a result, Young, batting at the lower-middle-order played one inning in each and failed to score in either.|$|R
5000|$|In 1986, System/38 {{announced}} {{support for}} Distributed Data Management Architecture (DDM). This enabled programs to create, manage, and access record-oriented files on remote System/36, System/38, and IBM mainframe systems running CICS. This support was extended into the AS/400 and its <b>follow-ons.</b> It was enhanced to support additional services {{that had been}} defined by DDM and to support AS/400-specific extensions, as allowed by DDM.|$|R
5|$|Developed {{alongside}} the subsonic and smaller Hawker Siddeley P.1127/Kestrel, the P.1154 {{was derived from}} the P.1150. The P.1150 proposal did not meet NATO Basic Military Requirement 3 and, consequently, the P.1154 was born. This Mach 2-capable aircraft retained plenum chamber burning previously designed for the P.1150. Although the technical winner of eleven submissions, <b>follow-on</b> testing and production for the P.1154 did not proceed as a result of political strife.|$|E
5|$|Early in {{his final}} year on campus, Middleton was once again pressed by the {{university}} president to retire from the army {{and go to work}} for the college. Again, Middleton could not do that, and began looking for a suitable <b>follow-on</b> assignment. Not having been overseas in over sixteen years, he put in a request for duty in the Philippines. He finished his tenure at LSU in the summer of 1936, having overseen the increase in students completing the ROTC program from about 500 to over 1700 cadets.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, German {{experiments}} with gold at a current of only 10µA demonstrated a relative uncertainty of 1.5%. <b>Follow-on</b> experiments using bismuth ions and a current of 30mA {{were expected to}} accumulate a mass of 30g in six days {{and to have a}} relative uncertainty of better than 1ppm. Ultimately, ionaccumulation approaches proved to be unsuitable. Measurements required months and the data proved too erratic for the technique to be considered a viable future replacement to the IPK.|$|E
50|$|Modern {{electronic}} {{automatic transmissions}} have electrical solenoids which are activated to change gears. Simple electronic-control designs (such as Ford's AOD-E, AXOD-E and E4OD) use the solenoids {{to modify the}} shift points in an existing valve body, while more advanced designs (such as the Chrysler Ultradrive and its <b>follow-ons)</b> use the solenoids to control the clutches indirectly, {{by way of a}} greatly simplified valve body.|$|R
5000|$|She was {{the second}} of five ships of the Leander-class light cruisers, {{designed}} as effective <b>follow-ons</b> to the [...] Upgraded to Improved Leander-class, she could carry an aircraft {{and was the first}} ship to carry a Supermarine Walrus, although both Walruses were lost before the Second World War began. At one time she carried the unusual DH.82 Queen Bee which was a radio-controlled unmanned aircraft, normally used as a drone.|$|R
50|$|Corporate finance is {{best known}} for {{offering}} mergers & acquisitions and capital markets advisory services. The firm has advised public and private institutions on buy-side and sell-side transactions as well as leveraged loans, private mezzanine debt, high-yield debt, IPOs, <b>follow-ons,</b> convertibles, PIPEs, private equity, and liability management transactions. The company has also developed an expertise in advising financial sponsors on all types of transactions, effectively creating one of the largest financial sponsors groups on Wall Street.|$|R
