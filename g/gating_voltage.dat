40|$|Controlled {{reaction}} kinetics of the bio-catalytic system of microperoxidase- 11 and hydrogen peroxide {{has been achieved}} using an electrostatic technique. The technique allowed independent control of 1) the thermodynamics of the system using electrochemical setup and 2) the quantum mechanical tunneling at the interface between microperoxidase- 11 and the working electrode by applying a <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> to the electrode. The cathodic currents of electrodes immobilized with microperoxidase- 11 showed a dependence on the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> {{in the presence of}} hydrogen peroxide, indicating a controllable reduction reaction. The measured kinetic parameters of the bio-catalytic reduction showed nonlinear dependences on the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> as the result of modified interfacial electron tunnel due to the field induced at the microperoxidase- 11 -electrode interface. Our results indicate that the kinetics of the reduction of hydrogen peroxide can be controlled by a <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> and illustrate the operation of a field-effect bio-catalytic transistor, whose current-generating mechanism is the conversion of hydrogen peroxide to water with the current being controlled by the <b>gating</b> <b>voltage...</b>|$|E

40|$|A simple space compression-dispersion {{model for}} ion {{transport}} at ambient pressure was mathematically established. On {{the basis of}} this model and aided by SIMION simulation, a three-zone theory was proposed to characterize the Bradbury-Nielsen gating electric field features as three zones: the depletion zone, the dispersion zone, and the compression zone. Then, the influences of <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> difference increases on the full width at half-maximum of the Cl- peak were investigated in detail to verify the theory. For example, at a <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> difference of 350 V and a gate pulse width of 0. 34 ms, the ion packets injected were reduced to as low as 60 % of their original widths, with the peak height increased from 756 to 808 pA and the resolution from 18 to 33, enhanced by 7 % and similar to 80 %, respectively. The ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) efficiency ratios, R-m/R-c and R-m/R-p, were also raised above theoretical values and reached about 182 % and 175 %, respectively. The experimental results were explained using the proposed theory with good consistency.

Thus, electrostatically tuning the density of states (DOS) available for intraband transitions provides the possibility to effectively control the terahertz absorption [69, 70]. As a result, large <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> is usually used.

Generally, the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> applied at the back-gate could {{modulate}} the vacuum barrier between emitter and collector. When the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> {{is less than}} the threshold voltage, the barrier is too broad to field tunneling for low-energy electrons. Also, the electrons might receive scattering by the impurities on the SiO 2 surface and trapped to the drawbacks of the emitter. As the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> increases beyond the threshold voltage, the width of the barrier is compressed accordingly. The electrons could overcome the narrowed barrier via the F-N tunneling, leading to the on-state of the NVCT. Moreover, the tunability of graphene energy band by <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> may be another contribution, as electrical conductivity of single-layer graphene can be modulated by <b>gate</b> <b>voltage.</b> As the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> increases, the Fermi level EF shift to the conduction band, thus, enhance the electron density of the graphene surface and improve the emission current.|$|R

Degradation is monitored as a function of time at various <b>gate</b> <b>voltages.</b> Under accelerated aging conditions (i. e. large drain <b>voltages)</b> the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> for maximum degradation is found to be different than the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> for which the substrate current is maximum; this is in contrast to the results of previous workers who found degradation and substrate current to be strongly correlated.

Furthermore, through the use of charge pumping measurements it is shown that two primary mechanisms are accountable for the degradation of these devices at small and large <b>gate</b> <b>voltages.</b> First, at large <b>gate</b> <b>voltages</b> there is an increase in the degradation which is predominantly due to electron injection and trapping in the oxide.

30|$|However, by {{negatively}} {{raising the}} <b>gate</b> <b>voltage,</b> {{it is probable}} {{to have a little}} increasing of the current due to some accumulated charges, which were injected from the source (region I) to the channel (red color areas in Figure 7). The drain current mainly flows through a bulk channel. An additional small conduction likely originated from a lightly accumulated channel in sidewalls facing the gates, when the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> is large enough. The influence of the gate on the channel is not very effective to induce an accumulation mode due to the device configuration, low doping concentration, and the lack of oxide layer between the gate and the channel. Accordingly, increasing the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> cannot help to make an effective accumulation layer and we do not expect to have the accumulation mode for high <b>gate</b> <b>voltage.</b> Normally in high doping JLTs in on state, after increasing the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage,</b> the device is able to be converted into the accumulation mode with significant increasing of the current (mostly is not desired to reach) [9, 47].

40|$|We {{present a}} theory for the memory effect in {{electron}} glasses. In fast <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> sweeps it is manifested as {{a dip in}} the conductivity around the equilibration <b>gate</b> <b>voltage.</b> We show that this feature, also known as anomalous field effect, arises from the long-time persistence of correlations in the electronic configuration. We argue that the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> at which the memory dip saturates is related to an instability caused by the injection of a critical number of excess carriers. This saturation threshold naturally increases with temperature. On the other hand, we argue that the <b>gate</b> <b>voltage</b> beyond which memory is erased, is temperature independent. Using standard percolation arguments, we calculate the anomalous field effect as a function of <b>gate</b> <b>voltage,</b> temperature, carrier density and disorder.

This device was first realized by E. Greger et. al. and us. Recent theoretical work by Hurd et. al. provided a sound basis by which to test the device against a model. The work presented here clearly indicates that the main conclusion of Hurd et. al. is sound. That conclusion was that the main response speed gain obtained by the back-gating is obtained by simply earthing the back contact. As well as this confirmation we have found strong dependence of the peak height of the response on the back <b>gating</b> <b>voltage</b> and a very strong position dependence of the excitation spot on the response particularly at low applied fields. We conclude that the back gating is an advantage over the conventional metal-semiconductor- metal photodetector and needs to be studied more extensively both theoretically and experimentally using devices capable of operation at above 100 GHz. © 2003 Copyright SPIE - The International Society for Optical Engineering...|$|E

This was obtained at high purity from touch-sensitive tendrils of Bryonia dioica. In this preparation, a calcium-selective strongly rectifying channel is prevailing whose single-channel properties have been characterized. The single-channel conductance is 29 pS in 50 mM CaCl 2.

The calcium release channel described here is effectively blocked by Gd 3 + which also completely suppresses a tendril's reaction to touch, suggesting that this channel could be a key element of calcium signaling in higher plant mechanotransduction.
