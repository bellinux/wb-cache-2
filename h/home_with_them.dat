5|$|It was {{not until}} 1840, that the Salukis were first brought to England. Referred to as Slughis, they and the modern Sloughi were treated as the same breed; however, recent genetic tests {{have shown that the}} two breeds are genetically separate. The first {{successful}} modern breeding line of Salukis began in 1895, with Florence Amherst (daughter of the 1st Baron Amherst of Hackney). Having seen Salukis on a Nile tour in that year, she imported a breeding pair from the Al Salihah area of Lower Egypt. A champion of breed purity, she struggled alone for nearly three decades, and real Saluki popularity did not take hold until the early 1920s, when officers returning from the war in the Middle East and the Arab Revolt brought their pet Salukis <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, women born on kibbutzim {{were much}} less {{reluctant}} to perform traditional female roles. Eventually most women gravitated towards the service sector. The second generation of women who were born on the kibbutz eventually {{got rid of the}} children's houses and the Societies of Children. Most found that although they had a positive experience growing up in the children's house, wanted their own children at <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
50|$|Many of {{the houses}} built were of simple iron and canvas construction. The rapid {{depletion}} of the high-grade ore around Silverton, along {{with the discovery of}} an even richer silver-lead-zinc ore body in nearby Broken Hill led to a sudden decline in Silverton's population, with many of those leaving taking their <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|R

25|$|However, {{the need}} for {{military}} transport aircraft remained high. Military transport tasks {{in the months after}} the end of hostilities included restoring transport links with recently-liberated countries in what had been German-occupied Europe. Aircraft were needed to deliver supplies and equipment, and to repatriate nationals of formerly-occupied countries who had served in Allied forces. In their years of exile many of those nationals had married and started families whom they now wished to take <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
25|$|During {{this time}} Johnson {{established}} {{what would be}} a relatively long-term relationship with Estella Coleman, a woman about 15 years his senior and the mother of the blues musician Robert Lockwood, Jr. Johnson reportedly cultivated a woman to look after him in each town he played in.

25|$|Native {{legend of}} the Lil'wat {{subgroup}} of the St'at'imc tells of a girl named Chinook-Wind, who married Glacier, and moved to his country, {{which was in the}} area of today's Birkenhead River. She pined for her warm sea-home in the southwest, and sent a message to her people. They came to her in a vision in the form of snowflakes, and told her they were coming to get her. They came in great number and quarrelled with Glacier over her, but they overwhelmed him and she went <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> in the end.|$|E

Today many of the original buildings and residents have once again picked up and moved to find better way of life, most moving to Foremost some even bringing their <b>homes</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> In the early 1990s, the dying community would suffer another loss - its four grain elevators - leaving the community in a ghost town state with only 6 buildings left.|$|R
50|$|Edo (modern Tokyo) {{became the}} seat of {{government}} for the military dictatorship in the early 17th century. The merchant class {{at the bottom of}} the social order benefited most from the city's rapid economic growth. Many indulged in the entertainments of kabuki theatre, courtesans, and geisha of the pleasure districts. The term ukiyo ("floating world") came to describe this hedonistic lifestyle.

25|$|Absinthe's {{popularity}} grew steadily {{through the}} 1840s, when absinthe {{was given to}} French troops as a malaria preventive. When the troops returned home, they brought their taste for absinthe <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> The custom of drinking absinthe gradually became so popular in bars, bistros, cafés, and cabarets that, by the 1860s, the hour of 5p.m. was called l'heure verte ("the green hour"). Absinthe was favoured by all social classes, from the wealthy bourgeoisie, to poor artists and ordinary working-class people. By the 1880s, mass production had caused the price of absinthe to drop sharply. By 1910, the French were drinking 36million litres of absinthe per year, as compared to their annual consumption of almost 5billion litres of wine.|$|E
25|$|Ashurbanipal sent an army {{against them}} in 667 BC that {{defeated}} the Nubian king Taharqa, near Memphis, while Ashurbanipal stayed at his capital in Nineveh. At the same time some Egyptian vassals rebelled and were also defeated. All of the vanquished leaders save one were sent to Nineveh. Only Necho I, the native Egyptian Prince of Sais, convinced the Assyrians of his loyalty and {{was sent back to}} become the Assyrian puppet Pharaoh of Egypt. After the death of Taharqa in 664 BC his nephew and successor Tantamani invaded Upper Egypt and took control of Thebes. In Memphis he defeated the native Egyptian princes and Necho may have died in the battle. Another army was sent by Ashurbanipal and again it succeeded in defeating the Kushites/Nubians. Tantamani was routed and driven back to his homeland in Nubia and was never again to threaten Assyria or Egypt. The Assyrians plundered Thebes and took much booty <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> How Assyrian rule in Egypt ended is not certain, but at some point Necho's son Psammetichus I gained independence while wisely keeping his relations with Assyria friendly.|$|E
25|$|Hagrid {{is absent}} {{during the first}} part of the fifth novel. The {{character}} later reveals to Harry, Ron and Hermione that he and Madame Maxime travelled across Europe together on a mission from the Order, planning to find giants and convince them to ally themselves with the good side and with Dumbledore; however, Death Eaters also find the giants and managed to get them to Voldemort’s side. Hagrid is attacked by giants during the mission, and saved by Maxime. Hagrid and Maxime eventually part on the journey home because of Maxime’s exasperation with Grawp, Hagrid’s half-brother whom he had found and was attempting to bring <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them.</b> Grawp, who wanted to stay with the giants, seriously injured Hagrid. Hagrid introduces his half-brother to Harry and Hermione, and asks them to take care of him after he leaves Hogwarts. High Inquisitor of Hogwarts Dolores Umbridge supervises the classes of all the members of the Hogwarts staff, including Hagrid's, and she looks for an excuse to fire him, as Hagrid is close to Dumbledore. Towards the end of the book, Umbridge and other Ministry officials attempt to arrest Hagrid. The latter manages to escape, but Professor McGonagall is injured whilst trying to defend him. Finally, with Dumbledore’s post as Headmaster restored, Hagrid returns to Hogwarts.|$|E

50|$|In 1878, an {{important}} discovery {{was made in}} the area. A gold nugget was found in the Karatara River, near Ruigtevlei. Soon fortune hunters {{from all over the world}} arrived at the Millwood Forest in search of gold, and Millwood grew into a bustling town. Millwood was declared a gold field, the first in South Africa. However, soon not enough gold was being recovered to sustain a growing town, and the mining industry in the area collapsed.

25|$|The Japanese Akita and American Akita {{began to}} diverge in type during the Post–World War II era. It {{was during this}} time, that US {{servicemen}} serving {{as part of the}} occupation force in Japan first came into contact with the Akita, the breed so impressed them that many servicemembers chose to bring an Akita back <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> upon completion of their tour. American servicemembers were typically more impressed with the larger more bear-like fighting Akita or German Shepherd type than they were with the smaller framed and fox-like Akita-Inu; the types of dogs they brought back with them to the US reflected this sentiment. Japanese Akita fanciers focused on restoring the breed as a work of Japanese art or to 'Natural Monument' status. American Akita fanciers chose to breed larger, heavier-boned and more intimidating dogs. Although, both types derive from a common ancestry, there are marked differences between the two. First, while American Akitas are acceptable in all colors, Japanese Akitas are only permitted to be red, fawn, sesame, white, or brindle. Additionally, American Akitas may be pinto and/or have black masks, unlike Japanese Akitas where it is considered a disqualification and not permitted in the breed standards. American Akitas generally are heavier boned and larger, with a more bear-like head, whereas Japanese Akitas tend to be lighter and more finely featured with a fox-like head.|$|E

500|$|Combat gear {{was issued}} by and {{belonged to the}} Roman army, {{and had to be}} {{returned}} {{at the end of a}} wearer's service. Cavalry sports equipment appears to have been treated differently, as soldiers apparently privately commissioned and purchased it for their own use. They evidently retained it after they completed their service. Both helmets and visors have been found in graves and other contexts away from obvious military sites, as well as being deposited in forts and their vicinity. In some cases they were carefully folded up and buried, as in the case of the Guisborough Helmet. The Dutch historian Johan Nicolay has identified a [...] "lifecycle" [...] for Roman military equipment in which ex-soldiers took certain items <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them</b> as a reminder of their service and occasionally disposed of them away from garrison sites as grave goods or votive offerings.|$|E

[...] Brunner says poll workers have sometimes cast ballots on machines in their homes. [...] She issued the following directive on the matter: [...] "We want Ohio’s voters {{and the rest of the}} nation to see that we have prepared a transparent process of transporting voting equipment, ballots and supplies.

500|$|Kudos {{began to}} develop the show after {{producing}} the Channel 4 medical drama series Psychos in 1999. Kudos wished to explore series ideas that saw beyond typical [...] "precinct-based dramas" [...] (crime and medical). Stephen Garrett decided on developing a spy drama after coming across John le Carré novels at a Waterstone's bookstore, and came to realise that MI5 or MI6 had not been featured as the setting for shows before. He felt {{the benefit of a}} spy show is that rather than in a crime drama where the protagonists take their work <b>home</b> <b>with</b> <b>them,</b> spies are given the added dimension that they cannot reveal their work even to their loved ones. In the meantime, Wolstencroft, who wrote Psychos, was also developing a spy drama, albeit as a film. When Kudos contacted him, they agreed they should work together to create a television series based on his idea, which was not to glamourise the world of spies, instead showing the audience that spies work in a [...] "shitty job". Kudos later pitched the show to all the major British television networks; however none of them were as enthusiastic as Kudos, as they did not see the potential of a post-Cold War spy series. After the commissioning teams from the networks were replaced, Kudos again pitched the show, albeit reinvented, and as a result Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, commissioned the show after planning to introduce [...] "braver", [...] "dynamic" [...] and [...] "pacier" [...] shows to attract a younger audience for the channel.|$|E
