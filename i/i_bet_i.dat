2500|$|Juri's {{fighting}} style {{focuses on}} the [...] "power and range" [...] of kicks. As a practitioner of taekwondo, she fights almost exclusively with her feet and rarely strikes with her hands. She {{has been described as}} [...] "agile and quick, but with low stamina." [...] Street Fighter player Justin Wong described her as a unique character, comparing her to a [...] "Guilty Gear type of character," [...] citing her dive kicks in part for this. GamePro editor Heidi Kemps commented that she is a character who is [...] "geared towards competitive players who enjoy screwing with their opponents' minds just as much as they enjoy slugging them in the face." [...] GamesRadar also described her as a character who [...] "functions best when she’s on the offensive and shutting down opponents before they can even get into position." [...] Developer Okada described her as a [...] "hectic character," [...] a quality that the developers had decided on from the beginning. She was created with the intention of making players see her as a character with potential; Okada commented that he wanted to instill a feeling of [...] "If I keep playing with this character, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> could do some really cool stuff" [...] in players. Developer Tamamura commented that players of Yun and Yang from Street Fighter III would enjoy playing with her. Seth Killian, Capcom Special Advisor to Super Street Fighter IV, described Juri as [...] "one of the most versatile characters." [...] He commented that she is a threat from mid-range as well as further away because of her dive kick, but theorized that characters like Zangief, Ryu, and Sagat would give Juri trouble due to their mobility and hard-hitting attacks.|$|E
60|$|LIZA. What {{is wrong}} with that, young man? <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> got it right.|$|E
6000|$|... "I heard horses {{trotting}} off there," [...] replied Sampson. [...] "Maybe {{the girls}} are coming. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> teach them not to run off again--Hello, Russ." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "What's your weight? <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you we weigh even, or <b>I</b> weigh most. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you Jack Morris beats you at birds or a mark, at five-and-twenty paces. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you <b>I</b> jump {{farther than}} you on flat ground, {{here on this}} green." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All right. But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you <b>I</b> ain't {{going to}} throw off on di'monds. Some of 'em's worth twenty dollars apiece--there ain't any, hardly, but's worth six bits or a dollar." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Laugh, you {{wild and}} woolly Westerners!" [...] ejaculated Carley. [...] "It {{must have been}} funny. I hope I {{can be a good}} sport.... But <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you <b>I</b> ride him tomorrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] exclaimed Cicely, in genuine excitement, [...] "what a bold stroke. Lady Shalem {{has worked}} that, <b>I</b> <b>bet.</b> <b>I</b> suppose {{it will go}} down all right." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Son, {{let me tell}} you, I'll own a horseless {{carriage}} some day, and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> go {{an average}} of twenty miles an hour with it, maybe forty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No!--is that so? AIN'T it bully! Why, Huck, {{if it was}} to do over again, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> could fetch two hundred! If {{we could}} put it off till--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Travers, a big, fresh-coloured grey-beard, {{with little}} {{twinkling}} eyes and very slow speech, [...] "you gentlemen {{know more about}} it than <b>I</b> do, but <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you <b>I</b> can lay my finger on {{the cause of the}} war at any minute." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm ready. And {{it will be}} a good {{excuse for}} you to knock off work. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you're glad <b>I</b> came! Does the {{carriage}} await or shall we take the subway?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Will <b>I?</b> You <b>bet!</b> <b>I</b> {{just thought}} maybe--Say, by golly, it does do a fellow good, don't it, {{to sit and}} visit about {{business}} conditions, after he's been to these balls and masquerades and banquets and all that society stuff. I often feel that way in Zenith. Sure, you bet I'll come." ...|$|R
6000|$|Mac {{turned to}} the speaker with rather a wild eye. [...] "Why, I see {{what looks like a}} patch of dry rot up yonder, that <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> could stick my fist into," [...] said he.|$|E
6000|$|... "Who? William Fourth? Well, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> have--he goes to our church." [...] I knowed he {{was dead}} years ago, but I never let on. So when I says he goes to our church, she says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cut it. Cut it now.--Say, Saxon, you ain't so big yourself, are you? But you're built {{just right}} if anybody should ask you. You're round an' slender {{at the same}} time. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can guess your weight." ...|$|E
60|$|Whenever I {{looked at}} {{the bow of the}} Snark or thought of her water- tight compartments, I was encouraged. Nobody else, however, was encouraged. My friends began to make bets against the various sailing dates of the Snark. Mr. Wiget, who was left behind in charge of our Sonoma ranch was the first to cash his bet. He {{collected}} on New Year's Day, 1907. After that the bets came fast and furious. My friends surrounded me like a gang of harpies, making bets against every sailing date I set. I was rash, and <b>I</b> was stubborn. <b>I</b> <b>bet,</b> and <b>I</b> <b>bet,</b> and <b>I</b> continued to bet; and I paid them all. Why, the women-kind of my friends grew so brave that those among them who never bet before began to <b>bet</b> with me. And <b>I</b> paid them, too.|$|R
6000|$|His shrill laugh rang {{high above}} the rest at the table, as he said: [...] "I'm the {{youngest}} man in this crowd, sir! Demmit, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> a hat <b>I</b> c'n dance down any man in this crowd; yes, sir. The old man can do it yet." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I just mean--" [...] he protested, with a {{sound of}} denial. Then he was angered into semi-honesty. [...] "You <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> do! I find plenty of folks, and doggone nice ones, that don't think I'm a weak-stomached baby!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thanks,' he said. 'No, {{but what}} I {{meant was that}} I wished I was in for this poetry prize. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> could turn out a {{rattling}} good screed. Why, last year I almost got the prize. I sent in fearfully hot stuff.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All these here critics {{telling what}} low-brows us American {{business}} men are! Just {{between you and}} I, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> knock down more good, big, round, iron men every week than nine-tenths of these high-brow fiddlers--yes, and college professors and authors, too!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Because if it's only a game--we boys {{against the}} masters," [...] {{continued}} Dan, [...] "then let's play according to rule. If we're here to learn--well, you've {{been in the}} class four months and I've just come, and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> know more Ovid than you do already." [...] Which was true.|$|E
5000|$|The project {{started off}} as a bet with his college roommate. Aboukhadijeh was quoted as saying, [...] "It {{started out as a}} bet with my roommate, Jake Becker. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> him <b>I</b> could build {{real-time}} YouTube search in less than an hour." [...] Aboukhadijeh lost the bet, for it took him three hours to complete the site, and another couple hours to polish it. Aboukhadijeh said he found it [...] "surprisingly easy to build".|$|R
6000|$|... "Even golf, for a {{beginner}} and--and a woman; you've got the swing in an astonishingly short time. In fact, you've {{been something of}} an eye-opener to me," [...] he declared. [...] "If <b>I</b> had been <b>betting,</b> <b>I</b> should have placed the odds about twenty to one against your coming from the West." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> ain't! I {{run across}} {{him in the}} woods about {{an hour or two}} ago, and he said if I hollered he'd cut my livers out--and told me to lay down and stay where I was; and I done it. Been there ever since; afeard to come out." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{lived in}} Lumberville two years, going to school, and I {{know a little}} {{something}} of what city life is. If I was a man, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't wear my life out on a farm, as Grant does. I'd get away and I'd do something. I wouldn't care what, but I'd get away." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's what I told him. At least, I said he couldn't row for toffee, so he {{said all}} right, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can lick you, and I said I betted he couldn't, and he said all right, then, let's try, {{and then the other}} chaps wanted to join in, so we made an inter-house thing of it. And I want you to come and stroke us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{got plenty}} of money! Just 'cause I'm hoofin' it---- I don't want no charity from nobody! I could buy out half these Honyockers! I don't need none of no man's money!" [...] He was {{efficiently}} working himself into a rage. [...] "Who you calling destitute? All I wanted was an advance till pay day! Got a check coming. You high-tone, kid-glove Eastern towerists want to watch out who you go calling destitute. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> make {{a lot more money}} than a lot of your four-flushin' friends!" ...|$|E
5000|$|Greenwald is a vegan and has {{appeared}} {{in at least two}} ads for PETA. He told PETA his reasons for going vegan: [...] "In college I stopped eating red meat on a bet with my girlfriend at the time. She bet she could stop smoking, and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> that <b>I</b> could stop eating red meat. She started smoking again, so I won, which I'm always proud of.…I had been a vegetarian as a child for whatever reason. I guess kids sometimes follow their instincts…My friend dared me to go vegan as I was reading this book Fast Food Nation, which opened my eyes to a lot of cruelties.…Ever since then, I've been vegan and enjoyed it daily." ...|$|R
2500|$|Bloomberg {{supports}} the strict drug laws of New York City. He {{has stated that}} he smoked marijuana in the past, and was quoted in a 2001 interview as saying [...] "You <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> did. I enjoyed it." [...] This led to a reported $500,000 advertising campaign by NORML, featuring his image and the quote. Bloomberg stated in a 2002 interview that he regrets the remark and {{does not believe that}} marijuana should be decriminalized.|$|R
5000|$|The {{other is}} Sandy Koufax, Hall of Fame pitcher, three-time Cy Young Award winner, and 7-time All Star who sat out game {{one of the}} 1965 World Series game to observe Yom Kippur, going to synagogue. When Koufax went to synagogue instead of {{pitching}} {{the first game of}} the 1965 World Series, Don Drysdale replaced him and was bombed; when Dodgers Manager Walter Alston arrived at the mound to take him out of the game, Drysdale quipped: [...] "Right now <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you wish <b>I</b> was Jewish too." [...] Koufax agreed to a rare filmed interview for the documentary.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{our first}} real home," [...] murmured Father. [...] "My old honey, we've come home! We'll have the Tubbses {{here from the}} Cape, come Christmas-time. Yes, and Crook McKusick, if we ever hear from him! And we'll play cribbage. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can beat Joe Tubbs four games out of five. Say, look here, young woman, don't you go to sleep yet. I'm a {{hard-working}} man, and it's Doc Schergan's orders that I got to be played with and hold your hand like this for fourteen minutes every night, before I go to sleep.... My old honey!" ...|$|E
6000|$|The {{first time}} that ever I saw these men was one evening after a regatta. They had all been rowing in it, and it had transpired that A could row as much in one hour as B in two, or C in four. B and C had come in dead fagged and C was {{coughing}} badly. [...] "Never mind, old fellow," [...] I heard B say, [...] "I'll fix you up {{on the sofa and}} get you some hot tea." [...] Just then A came blustering in and shouted, [...] "I say, you fellows, Hamlin Smith has shown me three cisterns in his garden and he says we can pump them until to-morrow night. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> can beat you both. Come on. You can pump in your rowing things, you know. Your cistern leaks a little, I think, C." [...] I heard B growl that it was a dirty shame and that C was used up now, but they went, and presently I could tell from the sound of the water that A was pumping four times as fast as C.|$|E
6000|$|The third {{night the}} house was crammed again--and they warn't new-comers this time, but people {{that was at the}} show the other two nights. I stood by the duke at the door, and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging, or {{something}} muffled up under his coat--and I see it warn't no perfumery, neither, not by a long sight. I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel, and rotten cabbages, and such things; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around, and <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> <b>I</b> do, there was sixty-four of them went in. I shoved in there for a minute, but it was too various for me; I couldn't stand it. Well, when the place couldn't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute, and then he started around for the stage door, I after him; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says: ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'From what we hear, {{we think}} not; I shall {{know more about}} it {{in an hour or}} two. At present I should not like to have to publish an opinion; but were <b>I</b> forced to <b>bet,</b> <b>I</b> would <b>bet</b> against him. Nobody is doing {{anything}} for him. There {{can be no doubt that}} his own party are ashamed of him. As things used to be, this would have been fatal to him at the day of election; but now, with the ballot, it won't matter so much. If I were a candidate, at present, I think I would go to bed on the last day, and beg all my committee to do the same as soon as they had put in their voting papers.' ...|$|R
60|$|BALSQUITH. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you a guinea he wont {{get even}} a week. <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> you another that Chubbs-Jenkinson apologizes abjectly. You evidently havent heard the news.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the spring}} of 1912 I went to Joplin, Missouri, {{just about the time}} the Titanic liner hit an iceberg and sank with more than 1,500 people on board. I was in a pool room there and beat a fellow named Snow Clark out of $500. To {{give him a chance to}} get even, <b>I</b> <b>bet</b> $200 <b>I</b> could jump across his pool table without {{touching}} it. If you think that’s easy, try it. But I could jump farther than a herd of bullfrogs in those days. I put down an old mattress on the other side of the table. Then I took a run and dived headfirst across the pool table. While I was counting my money, somebody asked Clark what my name was [...] "It must be Titanic," [...] said Clark. [...] "He sinks everybody." [...] so I was Titanic from then on.|$|R
