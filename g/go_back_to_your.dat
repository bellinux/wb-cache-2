25|$|I am {{sent here}} as a peace chief; all here is to be peace, but north of the Arkansas is General Sheridan, the great war chief, and I do not control him; and {{he has all the}} {{soldiers}} who are fighting the Arapahoes and Cheyennes. Therefore, you must <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> country, and if the soldiers come to fight, you must remember they are not from me, but from that great war chief, and with him you must make peace.|$|E
500|$|This hypothesis, {{although}} not perfect, perhaps best explains the evidence. Eighteen {{months prior to}} an October 1984 conference on lunar origins, Bill Hartmann, Roger Phillips, and Jeff Taylor challenged fellow lunar scientists: [...] "You have eighteen months. <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> Apollo data, <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> computer, do whatever you have to, but make up your mind. Don't come to our conference unless {{you have something to}} say about the Moon's birth." [...] At the 1984 conference at Kona, Hawaii, the giant impact hypothesis emerged as the most popular. Before the conference, there were partisans of the three [...] "traditional" [...] theories, plus a few people who were starting to take the giant impact seriously, and there was a huge apathetic middle who didn’t think the debate would ever be resolved. Afterward there were essentially only two groups: the giant impact camp and the agnostics.|$|E
500|$|The novel skims {{over the}} brutal attacks, lasting a week, on blacks in Detroit during World WarII. Years later, in 1967, Lefty is {{incorrectly}} told that that year's Detroit riots were started {{by a black}} man raping a white woman; this falsehood is never rectified. However, despite this misinformation, Lefty denies service {{to a number of}} white customers who partook in the riots. One dismissed customer even yells at him, [...] "hy don't you <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> own country?", returning the spotlight of racial prejudice on him.|$|E

500|$|Late on {{the night}} of August 15, Stark was awakened by the arrival of Parson Thomas Allen and a band of Massachusetts militiamen from nearby Berkshire County who insisted on joining his force. In {{response}} to the minister's fiery threat that his men would never come out again if they were not allowed to participate, Stark is reported to have said, [...] "Would you go now on this dark and rainy night? <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> people and tell them to get some rest if they can, and if the Lord gives us sunshine to-morrow and I do not give you fighting enough, I will never call on you to come again." [...] Stark's forces again swelled the next day with the arrival of some Stockbridge Indians, bringing his force (excluding Warner's men) to nearly 2,000 men.|$|E
2500|$|The note read [...] "Khartoum all right. Can {{hold out}} for years. C.G. Gordon", but the {{messenger}} (who knew very little English) had memorised another, darker message from Gordon, namely: [...] "We {{want you to come}} quickly". In the same month, Gordon received a letter from the Mahdi offering safe passage out of Khartoum: [...] "We have written to you to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> country...I repeat to you the words of Allah, Do not destroy yourself. Allah Himself is merciful to you".|$|E
2500|$|On 1 June, Gusmão {{visited a}} refugee camp near the United Nations headquarters, telling people [...] "The {{best thing you can}} do is <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> homes", and urging them not to take {{security}} matters into their own hands. On the same day, Interior Minister Rogerio Lobato and Defence Minister Roque Rodriguez resigned, Lobato blaming the crisis on opponents to the government resorting to violence rather than political means. Foreign Minister Ramos-Horta subsequently took over the Defence ministry, while Malaysian Foreign Minister Syed Hamid Albar urged Ramos-Horta to act strongly in his new capacity, in the interests of achieving political stability, while emphasising that the United Nations should be prepared to resume greater role.|$|E

2500|$|Reports of the {{collapse}} of this part of the Union line caused great consternation at Grant's headquarters, leading to an interchange that is widely quoted in Grant biographies. An officer accosted Grant, proclaiming, [...] "General Grant, this is a crisis that cannot be looked upon too seriously. I know Lee's methods well by past experience; he will throw his whole army between us and the Rapidan, and cut us off completely from our communications." [...] Grant seemed to be waiting for such an opportunity and snapped, [...] "Oh, I am heartily tired of hearing about what Lee is going to do. Some of you always seem to think he is suddenly going to turn a double somersault, and land in our rear and on both of our flanks at the same time. <b>Go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> command, and try to think {{what we are going to}} do ourselves, instead of what Lee is going to do." ...|$|E
2500|$|Two {{years after}} Lachmann's first husband died, [...] "Pauline Thérèse Lachmann" [...] (as the {{marriage}} banns read) and her rich Portuguese suitor were married on 5 June 1851, {{at a church}} in Passy; the writer Théophile Gautier {{was one of the}} witnesses. The day following the wedding, however, according to the memoirs of Count Horace de Viel-Castel, the new Madame de Païva gave her husband a letter ending the marriage. [...] "You have obtained the object of your desire and have succeeded in making me your wife," [...] she wrote. [...] "I, on the other hand, have acquired your name, and we can cry quits. I have acted my part honestly and without disguise, and the position I aspired to I have gained; but as for you, Mons. de Païva, you are saddled with a wife of foulest repute, whom you can introduce to no society, for no one will receive her. Let us part; <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> country; I have your name, and will stay where I am".|$|E
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>your</b> people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when I got down to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
