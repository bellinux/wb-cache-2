2500|$|Neither the Nuremberg or Tokyo Charters {{contained}} an explicit provision recognizing sexual and gender-based crimes as war crimes or crimes against humanity, although Control Council Law No. 10 recognized rape {{as a crime}} against humanity. The statutes of the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia [...] and the International Criminal Tribunal for Rwanda both included rape as a crime against humanity. The ICC is the first international instrument expressly to include various forms of sexual and gender-based crimes including rape, sexual slavery, <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> forced pregnancy, enforced sterilisation, {{and other forms of}} sexual violence as both an underlying act of crimes against humanity and war crime committed in international and/or non-international armed conflicts.

2500|$|Female genital {{mutilation}} {{has been described}} as [...] "the worst substantial human rights violation in Benin". About 13 percent of women and girls have been subjected to it (over 70 percent in some regions and tribes), but the law against it is rarely <b>enforced.</b> <b>Prostitution,</b> especially child prostitution, is also common, with the clients often being sex tourists. Sexual harassment is also common, with many female students being abused by their teachers. [...] Although it is a criminal offense punishable by up to two years in prison, enforcement is slack. Local customs which are unfavorable to women no longer have the force of law in Benin, where women enjoy equal rights under the constitution, including in matters related to marriage and inheritance. Still, they experience a great deal of social and employment discrimination owing to traditional attitudes about sex roles, and have a much harder time obtaining credit and when widowed do {{not have the right to}} manage their own property. Women in rural areas play subordinate roles and do a great deal of hard labor.|$|E
2500|$|After Nuremberg, {{there was}} no {{international}} court with jurisdiction over crimes against humanity for almost 50 years. Work continued on developing the definition of crimes against humanity at the United Nations, however. In 1947, the International Law Commission was charged by the United Nations General Assembly with the formulation {{of the principles of}} international law recognized and reinforced in the Nuremberg Charter and judgment, and with drafting a ‘code of offenses against the peace and security of mankind’. Completed fifty years later in 1996, the Draft Code defined crimes against humanity as various inhumane acts, i.e., [...] "murder, extermination, torture, enslavement, persecution on political, racial, religious or ethnic grounds, institutionalized discrimination, arbitrary deportation or forcible transfer of population, arbitrary imprisonment, rape, <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution</b> and other inhuman acts committed in a systematic manner or on a large scale and instigated or directed by a Government or by any organization or group." [...] This definition differs from the one used in Nuremberg, where the criminal acts were to have been committed “before or during the war”, thus establishing a nexus between crimes against humanity and armed conflict.|$|E

50|$|The Tunisian {{government}} made no discernible {{efforts to prevent}} trafficking during the reporting period; there were no government campaigns to raise public awareness of trafficking. Tunisia took steps to reduced demand for commercial sex acts by <b>enforcing</b> laws against <b>prostitution</b> and arresting “clients” soliciting commercial sex; however, these measures also resulted in the detention of women in prostitution, including possible trafficking victims. The government did not provide anti-trafficking training for military troops prior to their deployment on international peacekeeping missions.|$|R

5|$|As a result, {{there were}} a growing range of demands on the mounted police, and they {{struggled}} {{to cope with the}} changes. The rising population drove an increase in the criminal cases tackled by the force: less than 1,000 were investigated in 1900, but within four years the number of cases had risen to over 4,000. There was controversy around what role the mounted police should play in the new towns, and the force became concerned that these were pulling in police manpower, {{at the expense of the}} wider, less populated areas of the Prairies, where the patrolling system had already had to be cut back. A special railway branch was briefly established in 1888, using undercover officers positioned along the railway line to gather intelligence, and plans were put forward, but not enacted, to create a larger detective branch. Attempts were made to <b>enforce</b> the <b>prostitution</b> laws in the new towns – previously these had been largely ignored – with the police informally regulating the local sex industries.|$|R
5000|$|Under the act, {{persons who}} solicit sex [...] "in {{an open and}} shameless manner" [...] (a phrase that is not clearly defined), or who are [...] "causing {{nuisance}} to the public" [...] are subject to a fine {{of no more than}} 1,000 baht, while persons mingling in a [...] "prostitution establishment" [...] face a jail term of up to one month and/or a fine of up to 1,000 baht. The term [...] "prostitution establishment" [...] is not clearly defined, although it may be broadly interpreted to include any place where prostitution takes place, especially in regard to cases involving child prostitution that carry heavier penalties (up to six years if the prostitute is younger than 15 years of age)—otherwise, the law is not usually <b>enforced</b> against <b>prostitution</b> in private places. The act also imposes heavier penalties against owners of prostitution businesses and establishments: A jail term of three to fifteen years, or longer in the case of underaged or forced sex workers. The criminal code also stipulates penalties for procuring or using money earned from prostitution.|$|R

With the ratification of the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution over slavery and African-American suffrage, Barnum spoke before the legislature and said, [...] "A human soul, ‘that God has created and Christ died for,’ {{is not to be}} trifled with. It may tenant the body of a Chinaman, a Turk, an Arab or a Hottentot – it is still an immortal spirit". Elected in 1875 as Mayor of Bridgeport, Connecticut, he worked to improve the water supply, bring gas lighting to streets, and <b>enforce</b> liquor and <b>prostitution</b> laws.

50|$|War rape {{has been}} {{considered}} a war crime only since 1949.

40|$|The first Japanese {{edition of}} the book {{appeared}} {{at the height of}} debates about the interpretation of the Asia-Pacific War, debates which were also linked to conflicts about how the past should be represented in school textbooks. 2 Much of this controversy revolved around the issue of enforced military prostitution/military sexual slavery. 3 In 1991 Kim Hak-Sun (1924 – 1997) {{was one of the few}} women to come out in public in her own name to narrate her experiences in the <b>enforced</b> military <b>prostitution</b> system and demand an apology and compensation from the Japanese government. She was soon joined by survivors from Korea and other countries. Their campaign was supported by historians such as Yoshimi Yoshiaki, who revealed documents from military archives which supported claims of direct military involvement (Yoshimi 1992), the Korean Council for Women Drafted for Military Sexual Slavery and such groups as the Violence Against Women in War — Network Japan (VAWW-NET Japan). Subsequent years saw acrimonious debates on how the War should be remembered. By the time Beverley Yamamoto’s English translation of Gender and Nationalism appeared in 2004, the survivors’ campaign had culminated in the Women’s International War Crimes Tribunal on Japan’s Military Sexual Slavery, held in Tokyo in December 2000, with the verdict of the judges in the Tribunal being handed down in December 2001 (on the tribunal, see Kim 2001 : 611 – 620). In the meantime there had been further controversies about the Asian Women’s Fund which operated between 1995 and 2002. This was a private fund set up to provide funds to the survivors, but without official Japanese government involvement...|$|R
5000|$|According to {{historian}} Mark Thomas Connelly, [...] "a {{group of}} books and pamphlets appeared announcing a startling claim: a pervasive and depraved conspiracy was at large in the land, brutally trapping and seducing American girls into lives of <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> or 'white slavery.' These white slave narratives, or white-slave tracts, began to circulate around 1909." [...] Such narratives often portrayed innocent girls [...] "victimized by a huge, secret and powerful conspiracy controlled by foreigners", as they were drugged or imprisoned and forced into prostitution.|$|E
50|$|Rape, sexual slavery, {{and related}} actions {{including}} forced pregnancy and sexual slavery, are now recognized under the Geneva Convention as {{crimes against humanity}} and war crimes; in particular from 1949, Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, and later also the 1977 Additional Protocols to the 1949 Geneva Conventions, explicitly prohibit wartime rape and <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution.</b> The Rome Statute Explanatory Memorandum, which defines {{the jurisdiction of the}} International Criminal Court, recognises rape, sexual slavery, forced prostitution, and forced pregnancy as crimes against humanity if part of a widespread or systematic practice.|$|E

50|$|A {{huge number}} of {{international}} agreements set norms and limits of behaviour, including behaviour in conflicts, that necessitate provisions in national legislation. The Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court (1998), for instance, covers {{a broad spectrum of}} gender-specific crimes, including rape, sexual slavery, <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> forced pregnancy and forced sterilization. It also includes certain forms of sexual violence that constitute a breach or serious violation of the 1949 Geneva Conventions, as well as other forms of sexual violence that are comparable in gravity to crimes against humanity. The inclusion of gender crimes in the definitions of the statute is an important historical development in international law.|$|E
5000|$|Rape {{and sexual}} {{violence}} have accompanied warfare {{in virtually every}} known historical era. Before the 19th century, military circles supported the notion that all persons, including unarmed women and children, were still the enemy, with the belligerent (nation or person engaged in conflict) having conquering rights over them."To the victor goes the spoils" [...] has been a war cry for centuries and women were included {{as part of the}} spoils of war. Institutionalised sexual slavery and <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution</b> have been documented in a number of wars, most notably the Second World War (See #During the Second World War) and in the War in Bosnia.|$|E
5000|$|Rape has been, until recent decades, {{understood}} as a crime against honor and reputation - not only in domestic legislation, but also in international law; for example according to the Article 27 of the Fourth Geneva Convention, [...] "Women shall be especially protected against any attack on their honour, in particular against rape, <b>enforced</b> <b>prostitution,</b> or any form of indecent assault". It {{was not until the}} 1990s that the ICC statute recognized crimes of sexual violence as violent crimes against the person; [...] "Not until the last half century was rape understood to be an offense against the woman, against her dignity, instead of against her family's or her husband's honor".|$|E
