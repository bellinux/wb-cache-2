5|$|Few {{people in}} London {{other than their}} close friends knew that the couple were not married. Hogg's family had heard rumours that he was {{planning}} to marry, and had been curious to <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> he had chosen. They were very upset after hearing of his plans for a union with Jane. His mother was unwilling to introduce Jane to their social circles as Mrs Hogg, which ensured that she would never visit them. Hogg did not enter his family's house in Durham for seven years after he informed them of his relationship with Jane. Word of their union spread throughout Durham, and Hogg stopped practising law there for some time because of the damage to his reputation. Several of their friends were supportive of their union. Mary Shelley particularly approved of their match, despite having earlier been jealous of the time Hogg had spent with Jane.|$|E
5|$|On {{the weekend}} of Jack Donaghy's (Alec Baldwin) 51st birthday, his {{advances}} with CNBC host Avery Jessup (Elizabeth Banks) are called into question when he learns that his high school sweetheart, Nancy Donovan (Julianne Moore), has finally been divorced from her husband. Jack spends evenings having dinner and wine with both, against Liz Lemon's (Tina Fey) suggestion {{that it is a}} bad idea. He compares Nancy to actor Lee Marvin, after watching a movie marathon starring Marvin, and Avery to baseball player Derek Jeter, after he spends time with Avery at Jeter's home. He is moved by the thoughtful birthday gifts both women give him. Jack is torn between the easygoing, middle-class Nancy and his successful, wealthy counterpart Avery, and does not <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> to choose.|$|E

500|$|As a young teenager, Tatiana was {{assigned}} a regiment of soldiers, the Vosnesensky (Ascenscion) Hussars and given the rank of honorary colonel. She and Olga, who was also given her own regiment, {{would go out and}} inspect the soldiers regularly, an occasion they greatly enjoyed. When she was nearly fourteen, an ill Tatiana begged her mother to permit her {{to get out of bed}} in time to go to a review so she could watch a soldier she was infatuated with. [...] "I would like so much to go the review of the second division as I am also the second daughter and Olga was at the first so now it is my turn," [...] she wrote to Alexandra on 20 April 1911. [...] "...Yes, Mama, and at the second division I will see whom I must see ... you <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> ..." ...|$|E
500|$|Chebotareva, {{who grew}} to love [...] "sweet" [...] Tatiana {{almost like a}} daughter, {{described}} how the shy grand duchess once reached out to hold her hand when Tatiana was nervous about walking {{in front of a}} large group of nurses. [...] "I am so terribly embarrassed and frightened – I do not <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> I greeted and whom not," [...] Tatiana told Chebotareva. Tatiana's informality also impressed Chebotareva's son, Gregory. Tatiana once called Chebotareva at her home on the telephone and spoke first to her sixteen-year-old son. Gregory was annoyed when the grand duchess referred to him by his diminutive name, [...] "Grisha." [...] Not realizing who she was, the affronted Gregory asked the grand duchess to identify herself and she replied, [...] "Tatiana Nikolaevna." [...] When he asked her again, still not believing he was talking to a Romanov, Tatiana again failed to claim the imperial title of Grand Duchess and replied that she was [...] "Sister Romanova the Second." ...|$|E

500|$|... "The concept {{proved to}} be devastatingly {{effective}} against the enemy," [...] says Binda, [...] "playing him at his own game so successfully that he was, as a result, hard-pressed and confused to <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> he could trust." [...] However, by the same token, the Selous Scouts so resembled nationalist guerrillas that the Rhodesian security chiefs worried that their conventional units might mistake them for the real thing. Indeed, earlier in 1973, Sergeant André Rabie {{had been killed by}} friendly fire in precisely these circumstances during a similar deep cover action. Rabie gave an incorrect grid reference while calling for reinforcements, and when an RLI patrol saw him they mistook him for a guerrilla and shot him dead. To prevent this from happening to Selous Scouts, large areas of bush were periodically declared [...] "frozen areas" [...] where only they were allowed to operate. This gave rise to a common nickname for the unit, the [...] "Eskimos".|$|E
2500|$|... a Canadian {{scientist}} {{is using}} sound-level meters and a portable [...] "pentangular array" [...] of cameras and microphones {{to try to}} precisely identify {{the source of the}} sound, in order to <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> exactly to ask to fix it.|$|E
2500|$|In response, Gyurcsány insisted in {{a speech}} he held in Szeged on September 15 [...] that the local {{elections}} would have no bearing on his party staying in power, and [...] "those who don't want a war {{between the government and}} the city should <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> to vote for". (He was catcalled.) ...|$|E
60|$|MY DEAREST AUGUSTA,--And if you <b>knew</b> <b>whom</b> I had put off besides my journey--you {{would think}} me grown strangely fraternal. However I won't {{overwhelm}} {{you with my}} own praises.|$|R
6000|$|Olsen laughed. [...] "You {{could put}} him wise; but you couldn't embarrass us. The {{president}} <b>knows</b> <b>whom</b> he's up against. The trouble is he isn't {{strong enough to}} get after us." ...|$|R

2500|$|Usually generous gifts {{had their}} {{intended}} effects, however. During the stadtholderate Dutch officials in their turn {{had been the}} happy recipients of diplomatic largesse themselves. However, the De Witt regime was unusually impervious to corruption itself, as the French ambassador complained in 1653, because the power was so diffused [...] that one did no longer <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> to bribe, with the consequence that [...] "...cette dépense serait infinie et infructueuse.|$|E
2500|$|Ben Azzai {{taught that}} the words of [...] "This is {{the book of the}} {{descendants}} of Adam," [...] teach a great principle of the Torah. But Rabbi Akiva replied {{that the words}} of [...] "you shall love your neighbor as yourself," [...] teach an even greater principle. Hence, one must not say, [...] "Since I have been put to shame, let my neighbor be put to shame." [...] And Rabbi Tanhuma taught that those who do so must <b>know</b> <b>Whom</b> they put to shame, for [...] reports of humankind, [...] "In the likeness of God made He him." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{result was}} {{a society in which}} {{residents}} often did not <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> to trust, and in which few attempted to share their private thoughts with anyone but close friends or colleagues. A popular saying [...] in East Germany was that whenever three people engaged in a conversation, one was bound to be a Stasi informant. [...] Stasi efforts with one agent per 166 citizens dwarfed, for example, the Nazi Gestapo, which employed only 40,000 officials to watch a population of 80 million (one officer per 2,000 citizens) and the Soviet KGB, which employed 480,000 full-time agents to oversee a nation of 280 million residents (one agent per 5,830 citizens). [...] When informants were included, the Stasi had one spy per 66 citizens of East Germany. [...] When part-time informer adults were included, the figures reached approximately one spy per 6.5 citizens.|$|E

2500|$|Phillip Gerard is {{the host}} for Mike, a demonic [...] "inhabiting spirit" [...] who used to retain the {{services}} of Bob, a lesser demonic entity, to help him kill humans. Mike reveals that Bob has been possessing someone in town for decades, {{but he does not}} <b>know</b> <b>whom.</b> Donna takes on Laura's old route for the Meals on Wheels program in the hopes of finding more clues to Laura's murder. She befriends a young man named Harold Smith who is in possession of a second diary that Laura kept. She and Maddy attempt to steal it from him, but Harold catches them in the act, loses all faith in humanity, and hangs himself in his orchid greenhouse. The officers take possession of Laura's secret diary, and learn that Bob, a friend of her father's, raped her repeatedly as a child and that she began using drugs to cope. Cooper believes that the killer is Ben Horne, but Leland is revealed to be Bob when he brutally kills Maddy.|$|E
2500|$|The narrow {{requirements}} of Nevada's stop-and-identify law {{meant that it}} did not run afoul of the Fourth Amendment. [...] "In the ordinary course a police officer is free to ask a person for identification without implicating the Fourth Amendment." [...] Since Terry, it has been clear that a police officer who reasonably suspects that a person is involved in criminal activity may detain a person long enough to dispel that suspicion. [...] Questions related to a person's identity are a [...] "routine and accepted part of many Terry stops." [...] Knowing a person's identity may, of course, help to clear a suspect and divert the attention of the police to another suspect. [...] On the other hand, knowing the suspect's name may just as quickly confirm to the officer that the person is wanted for another, unrelated crime. [...] In cases such as this, where the police are investigating a domestic dispute, officers [...] "need to <b>know</b> <b>whom</b> they are dealing with in order to assess the situation, the threat to their own safety, and possible danger to the potential victim." [...] "The request for identity has an immediate relation to the purpose, rationale, and practical demands of a Terry stop. [...] The threat of criminal sanction helps ensure that the request for identity does not become a legal nullity." [...] Balancing the intrusion into the individual's privacy against {{the extent to which the}} stop-and-identify law promotes legitimate government interests, the Court concluded that the Fourth Amendment did not prohibit Nevada from making it a crime for a person detained under conditions of Terry to refuse to disclose his name to a police officer upon request.|$|E

60|$|Elsie {{turned toward}} him {{and he saw the}} strange, elusive {{tenderness}} shining in her eyes. Momentary as it was, it transformed her face, and he wondered whether she approved his sentiment or <b>knew</b> <b>whom</b> he meant.|$|R
