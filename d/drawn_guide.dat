There are three core components to the system: the tangible hardware, the recognizer {{used to identify}} the tangibles and the drawing software that works {{in tandem with the}} tangibles to provide intelligent visual <b>drawing</b> <b>guides.</b> Our recognizable tangible drawing instruments are a ruler, protractor and set square. Users employ these familiar physical instruments to construct digital ink drawings on a tablet in an intuitive and engaging manner. The visual <b>drawing</b> <b>guides</b> enhance the experience by offering the user helpful cues and functionalities to assist them to draw more accurately. A user evaluation comparing CapTUI to an application with passive tools showed that users significantly preferred CapTUI and found that the visual guides provide greater accuracy when drawing...|$|R

50|$|As this indicates, Uglow worked {{directly}} from life, {{and one of}} the features of his paintings was that he did not attempt to hide the process of construction. Remnants of the measurements he took and the <b>drawing</b> <b>guide</b> he used remain visible in the finished paintings. This was a process that Uglow developed from his early studies under William Coldstream, and it was to become a mainstay of teaching at the Slade School of Art in London tying into an already longstanding emphasis on drawing there. The result was paintings that had a strong sculptural quality, but within the tradition of the shallow picture plane of modernism, particularly as it was understood by Cézanne, although Uglow's work has also been compared to the simple classicism of the Renaissance artist Piero della Francesca particularly for the way he would make his life models pose in ways to emphasise simple geometric shapes. Planes are articulated very precisely, edges are sharply defined, and colours are differentiated with great subtlety.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} method for {{constructing}} a teleological model of a drawing of a physical device through analogical transfer of the teleological model of the same device in an almost identical drawing. A source case, in this method, contains both a 2 -D vector-graphics line drawing of a physical device and a teleological model of the device called a Drawing-Shape-Structure-Behavior-Function (DSSBF) model that relates shapes and spatial relations in the drawing to specifications of the structure, behavior and function of the device. Given an almost identical target 2 -D vector-graphics line drawing as input, we describe how an agent may align the two drawings, and transfer the relevant structural, behavioral and functional elements over to the target drawing. We also describe how the DSSBF model of the source <b>drawing</b> <b>guides</b> the alignment of the two drawings. The Archytas system implements this method in domain of kinematic devices that convert translational motion into rotational motion, such as a piston and crankshaft device. ...|$|R

What are the influences that inspiration plays in creation? These questions are what I {{want to explore}} for myself visually, creating compositions that are continually inventive. I explored these questions through a process driven by as pure an inspiration as I could obtain using the medium {{that is the most}} natural - and thus the smallest impediment to my thought process - and adding cohesiveness at the end to create a full, technical, interesting, and thought provoking composition. I think in ink, so to speak, and I used this quality to help me just draw; each piece evolved from one stroke to the next, growing and building with the simple joy of <b>drawing</b> <b>guided</b> by subconscious and experiential cues. As the drawings neared their completion, much more consideration was taken in order to form the complete gestalts.

40|$|The {{speed and}} pen-pressure while {{sketching}} a spiral are lower among Parkinson&# 039;s disease (PD) patients with higher {{severity of the}} disease. However, the correlation between these features and the severity level (SL) of PD {{has been reported to}} be 0. 4. There is a need for identifying parameters with a stronger correlation for considering this for accurate diagnosis of the disease. This study has proposed the use of the Composite Index of Speed and Pen-pressure (CISP) of sketching as a feature for analyzing the severity of PD. A total of 28 control group (CG) and 27 PD patients (total 55 participants) were recruited and assessed for Unified Parkinson&# 039;s Disease Rating Scale (UPDRS). They <b>drew</b> <b>guided</b> Archimedean spiral on an A 3 sheet. Speed, pen-pressure, and CISP were computed and analyzed to obtain their correlation with severity of the disease. The correlation of speed, pen-pressure, and CISP with the severity of PD was - 0. 415, - 0. 584, and - 0. 641, respectively. Mann-Whitney U test confirmed that CISP was suitable to distinguish between PD and CG, while non-parametric k-sample Kruskal-Wallis test confirmed that it was significantly different for PD SL- 1 and PD SL- 3. This shows that CISP during spiral sketching may be used to differentiate between CG and PD and between PD SL- 1 and PD SL- 3 but not SL- 2...|$|R
