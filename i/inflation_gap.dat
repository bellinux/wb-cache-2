40|$|The {{relation}} between the euro cash changeover and the perceived inflation in the Baltic countries Abstract This thesis focuses {{on the effect of}} euro cash changeover on inflation perception, and its relation to the inflation measured by central banks or by national statistical offices. We present an analyses of <b>inflation</b> <b>gap</b> in Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania at the euro introduction and detect its determinants by econometric methods.

The first part examines the theoretical background of perceived inflation and focuses at the phenomenon of increased <b>inflation</b> <b>gap</b> at the euro introduction. Second part contains an empirical study on <b>inflation</b> <b>gap.</b> We find out that perceived inflation in Baltic countries does not show such a divergence, as it was presented at the establishment of the Eurozone.

In my work I focus on the Euro era and compare the ECB with other two central banks, the Fed and the BoE.

This result can be linked to two ideas: firstly, the use of stationary time series drops out the significance of the <b>inflation</b> <b>gap</b> as regressor; secondly, a really forward looking central bank focuses on other macroeconomic leading indicators instead of examining the realized or expected <b>inflation</b> <b>gap.</b> ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{applies the}} info-gap {{approach}} to the unconventional monetary policy of the Eurosystem and so {{takes into account the}} fundamental uncertainty on inflation shocks and the transmission mechanism.

A conclusion from our framework is that including financial imbalances in the monetary policy objective does not necessarily increase policy robustness, and may even decrease it...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{systematically}} evaluate how central banks respond to inflation deviations from target. We present a stylized New Keynesian {{model in which}} agents' inflation expectations are sensitive to inflation deviations from target. To (re-) establish credibility, optimal monetary policy under discretion is shown to set higher interest rates today if average inflation exceeded the target in the past. Moreover, policy responds non-linearly to past <b>inflation</b> <b>gaps.</b> This is reflected in an additional term in the central bank's optimal instrument rule, which we {{refer to as the}} credibility loss. Augmenting a standard Taylor (1993) rule with the latter term, we provide empirical evidence for the interest rate response for a sample of nine IT or quasi-IT economies.

Our results {{are based on a}} bivariate unobserved-components model of inflation and unemployment in which inflation is decomposed into a stochastic trend and transitory component. As in recent implementations of the New Keynesian Phillips Curve, it is the transitory component of inflation, or “inflation gap”, that is driven by the real-activity gap, which we measure as the deviation of unemployment from its natural rate. Even when allowing for changes in the contributions of trend inflation and the <b>inflation</b> <b>gap,</b> we find that both are important determinants of inflation variation at business cycle horizons for all G 7 countries throughout much of the past 50 years.

40|$|In this {{dissertation}} {{three different}} economic {{issues have been}} analyzed. The first issue is whether monetary policy rules can improve forecasting accuracy of inflation. The second is whether the preference of a central bank is symmetry or not. The last issue is whether the behavior of aggregate dividends is asymmetry. Each issue is considered in Chapter II, III and IV, respectively. The linkage between monetary policy rules and the prediction of inflation is explored in Chapter II. Our analysis finds that the prediction performance of the term structure model hinges on monetary policy rules, which involve the manipulation of the federal funds rate {{in response to the}} change in the price level. As the Fed's reaction to inflation becomes stronger, the predictive information contained in the term structure becomes weaker. Using the long-run Taylor rule, a new assessment of the prediction performance regarding future change in inflation is provided. The empirical results indicate that the long-run Taylor rule improves forecasting accuracy. In chapter III, the asymmetric preferences of the central bank of Korea are examined under New Keynesian sticky prices forward-looking economy framework. To this end, this chapter adopts the central bank's objective functional form as a linear-exponential function instead of the standard quadratic function. The monetary policy reaction function is derived and then asymmetric preference parameters are estimated during the inflation targeting period: 1998 : 9 - 2005 : 12. The empirical evidence supports that while the objective of output stability is symmetry, but the objective of price stability is not symmetry. Specifically, it appears that the central bank of Korea aggressively responds to positive <b>inflation</b> <b>gaps</b> compared to negative <b>inflation</b> <b>gaps.</b> Chapter IV examines the nonlinear dividend behavior of the aggregate stock market. We propose a nonlinear dividend model that assumes managers minimize the regime dependent adjustment costs associated with being away from their target dividend payout. By using the threshold vector error correction model, we find significant evidence of a threshold effect in aggregate dividends of S&P 500 Index in quarterly data when real stock prices are used for the target.
