5|$|Streptococcal pharyngitis, {{also known}} as strep throat, is an {{infection}} {{of the back of}} the throat including the tonsils caused by group A streptococcus (GAS). Common symptoms include fever, sore throat, red tonsils, and <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the neck. A headache, and nausea or vomiting may also occur. Some develop a sandpaper-like rash which is known as scarlet fever. Symptoms typically begin one to three days after exposure and last seven to ten days.|$|E
25|$|Lymphoma is a {{group of}} blood cancers that develop from {{lymphocytes}} (a type of white blood cell). The name often refers to just the cancerous versions rather than all such tumors. Signs and symptoms may include <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> fever, drenching sweats, unintended weight loss, itching, and constantly feeling tired. The <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are usually painless. The sweats are most common at night.|$|E
25|$|Lymphadenopathy {{refers to}} one or more <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b> Small groups or {{individually}} <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are generally reactive in response to infection or inflammation. This is called local lymphadenopathy. When many lymph nodes in different areas of the body are involved, this is called generalised lymphadenopathy. Generalised lymphadenopathy may be caused by infections such as infectious mononucleosis, tuberculosis and HIV, connective tissue diseases such as SLE and rheumatoid arthritis, and cancers, including both cancers of tissue within lymph nodes, discussed below, and metastasis of cancerous cells {{from other parts of the}} body, that have arrived via the lymphatic system.|$|E
40|$|AbstractA patient {{presented}} with flu-like symptoms and a warm, tender {{area in the}} left axilla after working with an ancient piece of Cyprus wood. Antibiotics prescribed failed to improve symptoms. Followup physical examination and subsequent ultrasound found suspicious left-breast mass and an <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in the left axilla. Biopsy and lumpectomy of the left-breast mass revealed invasive ductal carcinoma. Biopsy and excision of the <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in the left axilla revealed necrotizing granulomatous inflammation without evidence of metastatic breast carcinoma. To our knowledge, {{this is the first}} case report to show the coexistence of breast cancer with necrotizing granulomatous inflammation in the ipsilateral axillary <b>lymph</b> <b>node,</b> likely due to exposure to ancient wood...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Lymphatic {{filariasis}} is {{endemic to}} tropical countries {{and is the}} most common cause of acquired lymphedema in the world. Wuchereria bancrofti is the main etiological agent responsible. While the presentation of filariasis in limbs is common, isolated presentation as a single <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in the neck is very rare. We describe a 48 -year-old Indian woman, who presented with a hard <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in the neck. There was no other significant <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement. The overlying skin was erythematous, and no other findings were present on examination. Ultrasonography of the neck revealed a single <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> in the left level 2 region, and fine-needle aspiration cytology showed microfilariae with surrounding inflammatory infiltrate. The patient was started on oral diethylcarbamazine and after 2 weeks of therapy, the <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> enlargement in the neck subsided and the erythema was relieved. ...|$|R
25|$|Demodicosis, {{also known}} as demodectic mange, is caused by Demodex canis mites which live in small numbers in sebaceous glands and hair follicles. These mites can cause {{inflammation}} and hair loss, and may also lead to secondary bacterial infections such as fever, lethargy, and <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes.</b>|$|E
25|$|Esophageal {{cancer is}} cancer {{arising from the}} esophagus—the food pipe that runs between the throat and the stomach. Symptoms often include {{difficulty}} in swallowing and weight loss. Other symptoms may include pain when swallowing, a hoarse voice, <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> ("glands") around the collarbone, a dry cough, and possibly coughing up or vomiting blood.|$|E
25|$|There {{are dozens}} of subtypes of lymphomas. The two main {{categories}} of lymphomas are Hodgkin's lymphomas (HL) and the non-Hodgkin lymphomas (NHL). Diagnosis, if <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> are present, is usually by lymph node biopsy. Blood, urine, and bone marrow testing may also be useful in the diagnosis. Medical imaging may then be done to determine if and where the cancer has spread. Lymphoma most often spreads to the lungs, liver, and brain.|$|E

50|$|Lymphoma is a usually {{malignant}} cancer. It {{is caused}} by the body producing too many abnormal white blood cells. It {{is not the same as}} Hodgkin's Disease. Symptoms usually include painless, <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>node</b> or nodes in the neck, weakness, fever, weight loss, and anemia.|$|R
25|$|Infectious {{mononucleosis}} (IM), {{also known}} as mono, is an infection commonly caused by the Epstein–Barr virus (EBV). Most people are infected by the virus as children, when the disease produces little or no symptoms. In young adults, the disease often results in fever, sore throat, <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> in the neck, and tiredness. Most people get better in two to four weeks; however, feeling tired may last for months. The liver or spleen may also become swollen. In {{less than one percent}} of cases splenic rupture may occur.|$|E
25|$|Additional {{testing is}} needed to assess how much the cancer has spread (see Staging, below). Computed {{tomography}} (CT) of the chest, abdomen and pelvis can evaluate whether the cancer has spread to adjacent tissues or distant organs (especially liver and lymph nodes). The sensitivity of a CT scan is limited by its ability to detect masses (e.g. <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> or involved organs) generally larger than 1cm. Positron emission tomography {{is also used to}} estimate the extent of the disease and is regarded as more precise than CT alone. Esophageal endoscopic ultrasound can provide staging information regarding the level of tumor invasion, and possible spread to regional lymph nodes.|$|E
25|$|An {{estimate}} of the mortality rate for the modern bubonic plague, following the introduction of antibiotics, is 11%, {{although it may be}} higher in underdeveloped regions. Symptoms of the disease include fever of , headaches, painful aching joints, nausea and vomiting, and a general feeling of malaise. Left untreated, of those that contract the bubonic plague, 80 per cent die within eight days. Pneumonic plague has a mortality rate of 90 to 95 per cent. Symptoms include fever, cough, and blood-tinged sputum. As the disease progresses, sputum becomes free-flowing and bright red. Septicemic plague is the least common of the three forms, with a mortality rate near 100%. Symptoms are high fevers and purple skin patches (purpura due to disseminated intravascular coagulation). In cases of pneumonic and particularly septicemic plague, the progress of the disease is so rapid that there would often be no time {{for the development of the}} <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes</b> that were noted as buboes.|$|E
5000|$|Diagnosis {{is through}} finding the fluke eggs microscopically in a stool sample.

[...] It is found mainly in the United States in the Mississippi River and Great Lakes areas. [...] It has also been reported in four Canadian provinces; Saskatchewan, Manitoba, Ontario and Quebec. Signs include weight loss, cough, fever, <b>enlarged</b> <b>lymph</b> <b>nodes,</b> draining skin lesions, eye inflammation with discharge, blindness, and lameness. [...] Because dogs are ten {{times more likely to}} become infected from the environment than humans, they are considered to be sentinels for the disease.
