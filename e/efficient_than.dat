Objects as small as bacteria operate a low Reynolds number and cylindrical forms are more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> the flat, paddle-like, forms appropriate at human-size scale.|$|E
5|$|Scientists have debated {{as to how}} sauropods {{were able}} to breathe with their large body sizes and long necks, which would have {{increased}} the amount of dead space. They likely had an avian respiratory system, which is more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> a mammalian and reptilian system. Reconstructions of the neck and thorax of Diplodocus show great pneumaticity, which could {{have played a role}} in respiration as it does in birds.|$|E
5|$|The CFM56-5A {{series is}} the initial CFM56-5 series, {{designed}} {{to power the}} short-to-medium range Airbus A320 family. Derived from the CFM56-2 and CFM56-3 families, the -5A series produces thrusts between 22,000 and 26,500lbf (98kN and 118kN). Aerodynamic improvements such as an updated fan, low-pressure compressor, high-pressure compressor and combustor make this variant 10–11% more fuel <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> its predecessors.|$|E

5|$|Contributing factors {{leading to}} this award {{included}} that during construction, 92% of construction waste was recycled, and non-wood wheat board {{was used in}} some of the walls. Additionally, 18 solar panels were installed on the building to generate power for use in the building, with the city purchasing all additional power through renewable power sources, funded in part by Portland General Electric and the Bonneville Environmental Foundation, while the building is 42% more energy <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> comparable buildings. Other environmental friendly amenities include occupancy sensors, ventilation that monitors carbon dioxide levels to determine when to activate, high performance exterior glass to reduce heat loss, infrared bathroom fixtures, and the use of recycled building materials among other items.|$|E
5|$|Film badges used {{to measure}} {{exposure}} to radioactivity indicated that no observers at N-10,000 {{had been exposed to}} more than 0.1 roentgens, but the shelter was evacuated before the radioactive cloud could reach it. The explosion was more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> expected and the thermal updraft drew most of the cloud high enough that little fallout fell on the test site. The crater was far more radioactive than expected due to the formation of trinitite, and the crews of the two lead-lined Sherman tanks were subjected to considerable exposure. Anderson's dosimeter and film badge recorded 7 to 10 roentgens, and one of the tank drivers, who made three trips, recorded 13 to 15 roentgens.|$|E
5|$|In August the UN {{also began}} using Korean civilians with A-frames as cargo {{carriers}} to move supplies {{up through the}} mountains to the front lines. This method of transport proved both cheaper and more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> using pack animals. American units obtained the civilian carriers through arrangements with the ROK Army. Soon the American divisions were using Korean labor for nearly all unskilled work, at an average of about 500 laborers and carriers to a division.|$|E

5|$|Modern whaling {{was more}} <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> open-boat whaling, {{employing}} steam-powered ships and exploding harpoons. Initially, modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales, but as these populations were taken, sperm whaling increased. Spermaceti, the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales, {{was in high}} demand. In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons, Norwegian expeditions took over 3,000 sperm whales {{off the coast of}} Peru alone. After World War II, whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high-performance machinery, such as automobile transmissions.|$|E
5|$|Nitrogen gas is an {{industrial}} gas {{produced by the}} fractional distillation of liquid air, or by mechanical means using gaseous air (pressurised reverse osmosis membrane or pressure swing adsorption). Nitrogen gas generators using membranes or pressure swing adsorption (PSA) are typically more cost and energy <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> bulk delivered nitrogen. Commercial nitrogen is often a byproduct of air-processing for industrial concentration of oxygen for steelmaking and other purposes. When supplied compressed in cylinders it is often called OFN (oxygen-free nitrogen). Commercial-grade nitrogen already contains at most 20ppm oxygen, and specially purified grades containing at most 2ppm oxygen and 10ppm argon are also available.|$|E
5|$|Several {{important}} {{technological advances}} had become available by this time, however, which necessitated several {{changes to the}} design. The advent of smokeless powder permitted smaller guns with greater muzzle velocities; the Navy had accordingly designed a 12-inch (305mm) 40-caliber high-velocity gun. In addition, Krupp cemented armor had been developed in Germany; the steel was a significant improvement over the older Harvey process. Since the steel was stronger, thinner armor plating could achieve {{the same level of}} protection and more importantly, significant savings in weight. Water-tube boilers were also now sufficiently reliable for use in warships. These were lighter and substantially more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> older fire-tube boilers.|$|E

5|$|The Duke {{was based}} on the BR Standard Class 7 Britannia design. It {{incorporated}} three sets of modified Caprotti valve gear, relatively new to British locomotive engineering and more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> Walschaerts or Stephenson valve gear. The Duke was regarded as a failure by locomotive crews due to its poor steaming characteristics and its heavy fuel consumption. Trials undertaken by British Railways also returned negative feedback, reporting problems with the poor draughting of the locomotive which resulted in difficulty adhering to the timetables.|$|E
5|$|The Mahans {{featured}} improvements over previous destroyers, with 12 torpedo tubes, superimposed gun shelters, and generators {{for emergency}} use. Standard displacement increased from 1,365 tons to 1,500 tons. The class {{introduced a new}} steam propulsion system that combined increases in pressure and temperature with {{a new type of}} lightweight steam turbine, proving simpler and more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> the Mahans' predecessors—so much so that it was used on many subsequent wartime US destroyers.|$|E
5|$|The Maratha {{redeployment}} was swifter {{and more}} <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> Wellesley had anticipated and he immediately reacted by extending his front to deny Pohlmann {{the opportunity to}} outflank him. A battalion of pickets and the 74th Highlanders, which formed {{the right of the}} first and second lines, were ordered to move obliquely to the right. This allowed the 78th to anchor the left flank and Madras infantry battalions (the 1/10th, 1/8th, 1/4th and 2/12th) to form the centre of the British line. Wellesley's intention was to force back the Marathas from their guns and then– operating by his left to avoid the heavily defended Assaye– throw them back on the Juah and complete their destruction with his cavalry.|$|E

5|$|According to the {{benchmarks}} on {{its official}} website, the Fastra II is {{faster and more}} power <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> its competitors, including the Fastra I and the Tesla C1060 video card. The benchmarks were performed on the Fastra II, the Fastra I, a 512-core cluster (consisting of Opteron CPUs), an Nvidia Tesla C1060 workstation card on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU, and on an Intel Core i7 940 CPU itself. The Fastra II is over three {{times faster than the}} Fastra I in CT slice reconstruction speed. Although the Fastra II consumes more power than the Fastra I, it's nearly 3 times as energy efficient as the Fastra I, and over 300 times as energy efficient as the 512-core cluster. The video cards run at 37 degrees Celsius when idle, and at 60 degrees Celsius at full load.|$|E
5|$|Although stiff {{wheels are}} more energy <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> {{other means of}} {{locomotion}} when traveling over hard, level terrain (such as paved roads), wheels are not especially efficient on soft terrain such as soil, because they are vulnerable to rolling resistance. In rolling resistance, a vehicle loses energy to the deformation of its wheels and the surface on which they are rolling. Smaller wheels are especially susceptible to this effect. Softer surfaces deform more and recover less than firm surfaces, resulting in greater resistance. Rolling resistance on medium to hard soil can be five to eight times greater than on concrete, and on sand it can be ten to fifteen times greater. While wheels must deform the surface along their entire path, limbs induce only a small, localized deformation around the region of foot contact.|$|E
5|$|In 1941, with World War II {{raging in}} Europe but the United States not yet at war, Feynman {{spent the summer}} working on {{ballistics}} problems at the Frankford Arsenal in Pennsylvania. After the attack on Pearl Harbor had brought the United States into the war, Feynman was recruited by Robert R. Wilson, who was working on means to produce enriched uranium for use in an atomic bomb, as part of {{what would become the}} Manhattan Project. Wilson's team at Princeton was working on a device called an isotron, which would electromagnetically separate uranium-235 from uranium-238. This was done in a quite different manner from that used by the calutron that was under development by a team under Wilson's former mentor, Ernest O. Lawrence, at the Radiation Laboratory of the University of California. On paper, the isotron was many times more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> the calutron, but Feynman and Paul Olum struggled {{to determine whether or not}} it was practical. Ultimately, on Lawrence's recommendation, the isotron project was abandoned.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} avoid its {{dependence}} on rare-earth minerals, Toyota Motor Corporation announced in January 2011 that it is developing an alternative motor for future hybrid and electric cars that does not need rare-earth materials. Toyota engineers in Japan and the U.S. are developing an induction motor that is lighter and more <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> the magnet-type motor used in the Prius, which uses two rare earths in its motor magnets. Other popular hybrids and plug-in electric cars in the market that use these rare-earth elements are the Nissan Leaf, the Chevrolet Volt and Honda Insight. For its second generation RAV4 EV due in 2012, Toyota is using an induction motor supplied by Tesla Motors that does not require rare-earth materials. The Tesla Roadster and the Tesla Model S use a similar motor.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the energy}} {{produced}} at Vega's core is generated by the carbonnitrogenoxygen cycle (CNO cycle), a nuclear fusion process that combines protons to form helium nuclei through intermediary nuclei of carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen. This process requires a temperature of about 15millionK, which {{is higher than the}} core temperature of the Sun, but is less <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> the Sun's proton-proton chain reaction fusion reaction. The CNO cycle is highly temperature sensitive, which results in a convection zone about the core that evenly distributes the 'ash' from the fusion reaction within the core region. The overlying atmosphere is in radiative equilibrium. This is in contrast to the Sun, which has a radiation zone centered on the core with an overlying convection zone.|$|E
5|$|Proteins can {{associate}} to form protein complexes, these often contain {{a set of}} proteins with similar functions, such as enzymes that carry out several steps in the same metabolic pathway. This organization can allow substrate channeling, which is when the product of one enzyme is passed directly to the next enzyme in a pathway without being released into solution. Channeling can make a pathway more rapid and <b>efficient</b> <b>than</b> {{it would be if}} the enzymes were randomly distributed in the cytosol, and can also prevent the release of unstable reaction intermediates. Although a wide variety of metabolic pathways involve enzymes that are tightly bound to each other, others may involve more loosely associated complexes that are very difficult to study outside the cell. Consequently, the importance of these complexes for metabolism in general remains unclear.|$|E
