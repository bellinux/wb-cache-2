25|$|Continuous {{reporting}} {{is a point}} of constant debate. Some parties, including analysts and investors, are interested in knowing how a company is doing at a given point in time. They argue that near real-time information would provide them with the ability to take advantage of important business moves as they happen. However, opponents are skeptical of how the raw information can be useful and fear <b>information</b> <b>overload,</b> or that there would be too much irrelevant information out there. Additionally, some companies are fearful that continuously reported financial information would give away important strategic moves and undermine competitive advantage.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The <b>information</b> <b>overloading</b> {{is one of}} {{the biggest}} {{problems}} nowadays. We can see it in various domains, including business, especially in the news. This is more significant in connection to web and news portals, where the quality of the news portal is commonly measured by amount of news added to the site. Then the most renowned news portals add hundreds of new articles daily. The classical solution usually used to solve the <b>information</b> <b>overloading</b> is a recommendation. In this paper we present an approach for fast content-based news recommendation, based on cosine-similarity search. Key words: news, recommendation, vector representation, user model...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Really Simple Syndication (RSS) {{has been}} {{utilised}} as a one way communication from a sender to many receivers. In Thai online newspapers industry, RSS has been employed for many years. Due {{to the emerging}} of RSS news feeds in online newspapers, the <b>information</b> <b>overloading</b> dilemma is barely avoided. Methods or techniques to categorised news into groups are important in order to overcome the <b>information</b> <b>overloading</b> problem. We propose a preliminary study on the investigation of categorisation processes in Thai newspapers industry. The experimental tests are properly performed with acceptable results. The results are represented by two measures that are the cosine similarity and the Euclidean distance according to the Information Retrieval theory. Limitations, further studies and their applications are seemingly addressed...|$|R
40|$|Misleading Information, in {{the form}} of data manipulation, and <b>Information</b> <b>Overloading</b> are {{phenomena}} that frequently occur when users look for information and interact with many information sources. In this paper, two innovative search algorithms will be proposed. Their aim is to autonomously search information about a particular topic, in huge hypertextual collections, such as the Web. Starting from a little resource set, e. g., bookmarks or references in some categories of directory services, the algorithms select interactively the links which have the potentiality to reach new interesting resources for the user. We argue that the information systems based on the proposed algorithms may successfully facilitate the users' interaction with the present Information and Communication Technologies, addressing problems as <b>Information</b> <b>Overloading</b> and the Misleading Information...|$|R
25|$|West Yorkshire Police were criticised {{for being}} inadequately {{prepared}} {{for an investigation}} on this scale. It {{was one of the}} largest investigations by a British police force and predated the use of computers. Information on suspects was stored on handwritten index cards. Aside from difficulties in storing and accessing the paperwork (the floor of the incident room was reinforced to cope with the weight of the paper), it was difficult for officers to overcome the <b>information</b> <b>overload</b> of such a large manual system. Sutcliffe was interviewed nine times, but all information the police had about the case was stored in paper form, making cross-referencing difficult, compounded by television appeals for information which generated thousands more documents.|$|E
25|$|It {{was known}} that the filter room could be {{overwhelmed}} by a high volume of reports, {{and it was a}} constant complaint that it was a single point of failure in reports from OR and in the RAF and Air Ministry. Most critics wanted the filter room to be moved from Bentley Priory to Group commands, lowering the reporting volume at each location and providing duplication. Dowding refused the change, leading to increasing friction with other commanders. <b>Information</b> <b>overload</b> occurred on several occasions and the filter room had to ask certain CH stations to stop reporting. But this had little effect on their capabilities. Later, stations reported information for multiple formations as a single plot.|$|E

500|$|Critics also {{commented on}} the {{contrast}} between lyrical themes and underlying music. Digital Spys Harry Fletcher wrote that there is [...] "something eminently Mancunian" [...] about the clash in styles. Uncut praised the band's [...] "innovative songcraft", but added [...] "their tendency to overthink and squeeze every drop of pleasure from their work does them few favours", while Mojo suggested that they were [...] "self-consciously dialing everything up to 11 before things go up in flames". The Guardians Alexis Petridis compared the album's sound to its themes in a three-star review, suggesting that the album [...] " [...] the <b>information</b> <b>overload</b> of 24-hour rolling news so well that it essentially provokes the same reaction: it's often compelling, but you occasionally find yourself gripped by an overwhelming urge to turn it off". The album was among the favourites for the Mercury Prize, with British bookmakers Ladbrokes at one time offering odds of 4/1, but was not among the twelve albums selected for the shortlist.

500|$|In {{addition}} to its stylistic oddities, the Astronomica includes some contradictions. Green calls the poem [...] "riddled with confusion and contradiction", citing its [...] "presentation of incompatible systems of astrological calculation, <b>information</b> <b>overload,</b> deferral of meaning and contradictory instruction". At the same time, Green notes that similar issues exist in other first- to third-century astrological works. According to Caroline Stark, Manilius paradoxically claims that astrological knowledge may be acquired by individuals {{and that it is}} only granted by divine favor. T. Barton suggests that Manilius may have included these contradictions and complexities so as to be seen as [...] "a figure of unreachable knowledge for the novice student-reader". Green, while not ruling out this hypothesis, argues that Manilius was probably not motivated by a [...] "desire to carve out for himself a position of power in the new imperial world of experts" [...] as Barton suggests. Rather, Green contends that Maniliusdue to his [...] "pride in poetic innovation" [...] and his [...] "deference ... to the Emperor"sought to present [...] "himself as a compliant imperial agent, intent on producing a creative poetic enterprise that plots its own way through the levels of acceptable stellar discourse in the early empire". David Pingree similarly concludes that the poem's [...] "principal purpose seems to have been to delight its audience with poetry and to arouse admiration for the poet by its cleverness".|$|E

This part of the opening segment was intended to create confusion among the audience regarding the show's message, and eventually lead to <b>information</b> <b>overload.</b> [...] U2 performed [...] "Zooropa" [...] live at three consecutive concerts during the fourth leg of the Zoo TV Tour in 1993. Bono originally discussed how the song would be played live during the album's recording sessions, saying that The Edge's guitar riffs may be extended in concert. The song debuted live at a concert in Glasgow in August 1993, and was performed {{in the middle of the}} set list following [...] "Numb". The live version was much shorter than the album version, skipping the piano intro, as well as the first three verses, starting with the line [...] "I have no compass, and I have no map". U2 had difficulty performing the song live, which Bono acknowledged to the audience following its debut. According to the book U2 Live: A Concert Documentary, the song's first performance sounded [...] "shaky" [...] and needed more rehearsal, although its subsequent Zoo TV performances [...] "sound better". Adam Clayton suggested performing the song as the show opener during the rehearsals for the tour's fifth and final Zoomerang leg, but it was not performed again on the tour.|$|E
