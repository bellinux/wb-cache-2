5000|$|The Widom <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> is a {{statistical}} thermodynamic {{approach to the}} calculation of material and mixture properties. It is named for Benjamin Widom, who derived it in 1963. [...] In general, there are two theoretical approaches to determining the statistical mechanical properties of materials. The first is the direct calculation of the overall partition function of the system, which directly yields the system free energy. The second approach, known as the Widom <b>Insertion</b> <b>method,</b> instead derives from calculations centering on one molecule. The Widom <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> directly yields the chemical potential of one component rather than the system free energy. This approach is most widely applied in molecular computer simulations but has also been applied {{in the development of}} analytical statistical mechanical models.|$|E

50|$|There {{are three}} primary {{categories}} of tree construction methods: top-down, bottom-up, and <b>insertion</b> <b>methods.</b> Top-down methods proceed by partitioning the input set into two (or more) subsets, bounding {{them in the}} chosen bounding volume, then keep partitioning (and bounding) recursively until each subset consists of only a single primitive (leaf nodes are reached). Top-down methods are easy to implement, fast to construct and {{by far the most}} popular, but do not result in the best possible trees in general. Bottom-up methods start with the input set as the leaves of the tree and then group two (or more) of them to form a new (internal) node, proceed in the same manner until everything has been grouped under a single node (the root of the tree). Bottom-up methods are more difficult to implement, but likely to produce better trees in general. Both top-down and bottom-up methods are considered off-line methods as they both require all primitives to be available before construction starts. <b>Insertion</b> <b>methods</b> build the tree by inserting one object at a time, starting from an empty tree. The insertion location should be chosen that causes the tree to grow as little as possible according to a cost metric. <b>Insertion</b> <b>methods</b> are considered on-line methods since they do not require all primitives to be available before construction starts and thus allow updates to be performed at runtime.|$|R

5000|$|Although Donders' work {{paved the}} way for future {{research}} in mental chronometry tests, it was not without its drawbacks. His <b>insertion</b> <b>method,</b> often referred to as [...] "pure insertion", was {{based on the assumption that}} inserting a particular complicating requirement into an RT paradigm would not affect the other components of the test. This assumption - that the incremental effect on RT was strictly additive - was not able to hold up to later experimental tests, which showed that the insertions were able to interact with other portions of the RT paradigm. Despite this, Donders' theories are still of interest and his ideas are still used in certain areas of psychology, which now have the statistical tools to use them more accurately.|$|E

Sink <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> {{is one of the}} mesh quality improvement methods that had been proposed recently. However, it is unknown whether this method is com-petitive to generate meshes with small number of elements. In this paper, we show that, given a two-dimensional polygonal domain with no small angles, the sink <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> generates a well-shaped mesh with O(n) triangles, where n is the minimum number of triangles generated by any method with the same quality guarantee.

40|$|This diploma thesis {{deals with}} static and dynamic capacitated {{messenger}} problem and its solving with heuristic algorithms. Different {{variations of the}} capacitated messenger problem were considered, with a single messenger or multiple messengers, with one depot or multiple depots in case of multiple messengers.

Modified nearest neighbour method, modified <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> and modified exchange method were used to solve the problem. The main contribution of the thesis is deriving heuristics for described types of messenger problem and programming the algorithms in VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) in MS Excel.

40|$|Abstract—Steganography {{is the art}} {{of hiding}} the fact that {{communication}} is taking place, by hiding information in other information. Many different carrier file formats can be used, but digital images are the most popular because of their frequency on the Internet. For hiding secret information in images, there exists a large variety of Steganographic techniques some are more complex than others and all of them have respective strong and weak points. The Least Significant Bit (LSB) <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> is the most common and easiest method for embedding messages in an image. This paper work intends to give an overview of image Steganography, its uses and techniques along with an attempt to implement a basic image Steganographic model by using an adaptive encoding algorithm which attempts to maximize the embedding capacity of each pixel through LSB <b>insertion</b> <b>method.</b> The Implementation is named StegSan which also uses file compression and data encoding mechanisms to make the image more secure and less detectable.

In this paper, we discuss a delay <b>insertion</b> <b>method</b> which makes such a semi-synchronous circuit faster. The max-imum delay-to-register ratio of the cycles on the circuit gives a lower bound of the clock period.
