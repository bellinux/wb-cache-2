25|$|In 13th century medieval Europe, {{psychiatric}} hospitals were built {{to house the}} mentally ill, but there were not any nurses {{to care for them}} and treatment was rarely provided.

25|$|According to the post-slide report {{released}} by Multiconsult and reviewed by NTNU, several potential indirect causes 'should be discussed': First of all, starting {{weeks before the}} slide, Western Norway was subjected to record-breaking precipitation and winds, which increased in strength when the remains of Hurricane Maria reached shore. The rainstorm, named Kristin by meteorologists, caused floods, traffic jams, material damage and power outages. The precipitation gradually increased pore pressure between the mountain and loose masses, adding to the damage of a process of erosion from surface water. This process may have been further hastened by the possible breach of a water pipe, indicated by a <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> losing its water supply at around 17 o'clock the day previous to the slide. Also, what {{may have contributed to}} the incident was as a garage that was constructed in the neighbourhood on a fill-in site.|$|E
25|$|Eventually a chain {{will come}} to an end, usually with a new entrant into the system or when the last unit in a chain is abandoned, merged, or destroyed. This can involve a new {{employee}} recruit or a <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> on market for the first time, or when {{a house in the}} chain is torn down, left empty, or the duties of a vacant job are distributed among other employees. A vacancy chain is simply the sequence of moves that a vacancy makes from initial entry into a system to final termination. The distribution of material resources and social positions through vacancy chain processes requires that the things distributed possess a number of abstract qualities. These qualities include that the resource units in question are reusable, discrete, identifiable, and utilized by one individual or social group at a time.|$|E
25|$|Insulae {{have been}} the subject of great debate for historians of Roman culture, {{defining}} the various meanings of the word. Insula was a word used to describe apartment buildings, or the apartments themselves, meaning apartment, or inhabitable room, demonstrating just how small apartments for Plebes were. Urban divisions were originally street blocks, and later began to divide into smaller divisions, the word insula referring to both blocks and smaller divisions. The insula contained cenacula, tabernae, storage rooms under the stairs, and lower floor shops. Another type of <b>housing</b> <b>unit</b> for Plebes was a cenaculum, an apartment, divided into three individual rooms: cubiculum, exedra, and medianum. Common Roman apartments were mainly masses of smaller and larger structures, many with narrow balconies that present mysteries as to their use, having no doors to access them, and they lacked the excessive decoration and display of wealth that aristocrats’ houses contained. Luxury in houses was not common, as the life of the average person did not consist of being in their houses, as they instead would go to public baths, and engage in other communal activities.|$|E
