40|$|The <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> <b>air</b> into porous {{systems in}} drying {{processes}} is often localized in soft materials, such as colloidal suspensions and granular pastes, and it typically develops {{in the form}} of cracks before ordinary drying begins. To investigate such processes, we construct an invasion percolation model on a deformable lattice for cohesionless elastic systems, and with this model we derive the condition under which cracking occurs. A Griffith-like condition characterized by a dimensionless parameter is proposed, and its validity is checked numerically. This condition indicates that the ease with which cracking occurs increases as the particles composing the material become smaller, as the rigidity of the system increases, and as the degree of heterogeneity characterizing the drying processes decreases.

50|$|A {{different}} {{mission of}} sorts was ordered by III Fighter Command, the training <b>of</b> <b>Air</b> Commando fighter units for the China Burma India Theater and the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> Burma. <b>Air</b> Commando units were formed {{to be part}} <b>of</b> the <b>invasion</b> force to operate from captured Japanese airfields behind the main battle lines in India. Parachutists would be dropped on enemy held fields, and quickly the Allies would fly in fighter and transport units to operate from those fields. As the battle moved further east, the commandos would jump ahead and establish new bases. In each case the pattern had been the same: spot open spaces from the air, send in glider-borne engineers and equipment to hack an airstrip from the brush, and {{within a matter of}} hours, fly in troops to harass the enemy and his lines of communication with P-51 Mustang fighter and B-25 medium bomber units.|$|R

By 6 June, Allied fighter pilots had succeeded in damaging or destroying hundreds of locomotives, thousands of motorized vehicles, and many bridges. In addition, German airfields in France and Belgium were attacked.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. A {{study of}} a weather {{phenomenon}} was carried out, where inter-action between middle latitude and tropical waves had occurred. The goal {{of this study was}} to simulate the interaction using a numerical model. The phe-nomenon occurred under winter synoptic regime and could lead to wide spread showers over a band that cover most of the kingdom. A detailed synoptic de-scription of a case, where the interaction had occurred over west Africa, was discussed. It was shown that the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>air</b> to the south of 30 ºN was a necessary trigger action for such interaction. In this case a south wind com-ponent was developed due to air mass thermal differences. The developed wind component caused a change in the direction of the subtropical jet from westerly to south-west. This caused northerly advection <b>of</b> moist <b>air</b> from the Inter Tropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ) where deep convective cells existed. When a polar frontal system passed through the subtropical region and came in phase with the axis of the advected moisture tongue, rapid development of the system had occurred. In this case an active cloud band was formed and ex-tended from the tropics to the middle latitude wave. 1...|$|R
50|$|With {{the help}} of Mathunny Mathews, the airlift of Indians was carried out from 13 August to 11 October 1990 after the <b>Invasion</b> <b>of</b> Kuwait. <b>Air</b> India holds the Guinness Book of World Records for the most people {{evacuated}} by a civil airliner {{as a result of}} this effort. The operation was carried out during the Persian Gulf War in 1990 to evacuate Indian expatriates from Kuwait and Iraq. It is believed to be the largest civilian evacuation in history. The Indians based in Kuwait also helped in the evacuation efforts. Leading daily Times of India reported that Kuwait-based Malayali entrepreneur Mathunny Mathews (also known as Toyota Sunny) duly supported by Harbhajan Singh Vedi, played a stellar role in co-ordinating the evacuation operation by meeting Indian ambassador in Baghdad and overseeing the transport of thousands of Indians to Amman via Baghdad by bus after striking a deal with Iraqi transporters, Indian authorities and UN. On 22 January 2016, Airlift, a Hindi film playing Akshay Kumar as Ranjit Katyal, a fictional character based on Mathunny Mathews was released.|$|R

40|$|Global {{climate change}} {{is one of the}} most {{important}} international problems of the 21 st century. The overall rapid increase in the dynamics of cataclysms, which have been observed in recent decades, is particularly alarming. Howdo modern scientists predict the occurrence of certain events? In meteorology, unusually powerful cumulonimbus clouds are one of the main conditions for the emergence of a tornado. The former, in their turn, are formed during the <b>invasion</b> <b>of</b> cold <b>air</b> on the overheated land surface. The satellite captures the cloud front, and, based on these pictures, scientists make assumptions about the possibility of occurrence of the respective natural phenomena. In fact, mankind visually observes and draws conclusions about the consequences of the physical phenomena which have already taken place in the invisible world, so the conclusions of scientists are assumptions by their nature, rather than precise knowledge of the causes of theorigin of these phenomena in the physics of microcosm. The latest research in the field of the particle physics and neutrino astrophysics, which was conducted by a working team of scientists of ALLATRA International Public Movement (hereinafter ALLATRA SCIENCE group) allatra-science. org, last accessed 10 April 2016., offers increased opportunities for advanced fundamental and applied research in climatic engineering...|$|R
