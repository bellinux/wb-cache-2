40|$|Debris flows, {{landslides}} {{and rock}} falls are severe abrupt mass movement hazards, whose recorded occurrence in China has increased markedly {{in the past}} two decades. With the county- and city-based data, the debris flow hazard zonation for China was accomplished using the Rapid Zonation <b>of</b> Abrupt Mass-movement <b>Hazard</b> (RZAMH) approach, whose principles are described in the Part I companion paper. The entire area of China was classified into five regions with different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard.</b> Landslide and rock-fall hazard zonations for China were also presented. A sensitivity analysis demonstrated the robustness of the RZAMH approach. Direct validation was made with comparison of the zonation results and historical recordings on occurrence distribution of debris flows.

While ASIL D encompasses at most the hazards of a loaded passenger van, DAL A includes the greater hazards of large aircraft loaded with fuel and passengers.

40|$|It is {{essential}} for the safe use of chemicals to classify them according to their <b>hazards.</b> Different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> must be identified based on specific cut-off values.

At the United Nations Conference on Environment and Development (UNCED) held in 1992 in Brazil, the establishment of a globally harmonized hazard classification and compatible labelling system (GHS) was adopted. A study was conducted to assess GHS capacity at the ASEAN regional level, and an implementation strategy has been developed.

In 1926 official guidelines were issued by the Ministry of Transport that defined where and how white lines on roads should be used. A broken white line in the direction of travel, where the gaps are longer than the painted lines, indicates the centre of the road and that there are no hazards specific to the design and layout of the road, i.e. no turnings, sharp bends ahead etc. A broken white line in which the gaps are shorter than the painted lines indicates an upcoming hazard, the proportion of white to black indicates the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> i.e. more white means more hazard.|$|E
40|$|Although risk assessment, {{assessing}} the potential harm of each particular exposure of a substance, is desirable, {{it is not}} feasible in many situations. Risk assessment uses a process of hazard identification, hazard characterisation, and exposure assessment as its components. In the absence of risk assessment, the purpose of classification is to give broad guidance (through the label) on the suitability of a chemical {{in a range of}} use situations. Hazard classification in the EU is a process involving identification of the hazards of a substance, followed by comparison of those hazards (including <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard)</b> with defined criteria. Classification should therefore give guidance on <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> as well as hazard identification. Potency is the most important indicator of <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> and should therefore be included in classification. This is done for acute lethality and general toxicity by classifying on dose required to cause the effect. The classification in the EU for carcinogenicity and reproductive toxicity does not discriminate across the wide range of potencies seen (6 orders of magnitude) for carcinogenicity and for developmental toxicity and fertility. Therefore potency {{should be included in the}} classification process. The methodology in the EU guidelines for classification for deriving specific concentration limits is a rigorous process for assigning substances which cause tumours or developmental toxicity and infertility in experimental animals to high, medium or low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> categories by incorporating potency. Methods are suggested on how the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> so derived could be used in the EU classification process to improve hazard communication and in downstream risk management...|$|E
40|$|Several {{case studies}} of geomorphological mapping at various scales in order to {{identify}} areas prone to alluvial fan ﬂooding are presented in this paper. The selected areas are located in southern Italy and are representative of a geomorphic unit (foothills consisting of coalescent alluvial fans) found throughout the southern Apennines. The medium-scale approach represents the best tool to identify areas susceptible to ﬂooding, using detailed geomorphological mapping of fan systems. It can be considered a preliminary analysis, which provides important information for large areas and identiﬁes zones which need further investigation. Large-scale map analysis may be applied to a single fan and used to distinguish fan portions prone to different <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> exposure, thus providing accurate information for decision-makers who are called upon to plan hazard management. In both cases, analysis based on detailed geological and geomorphological ﬁeld surveys is often coupled with remotely sensed data...|$|R
50|$|Cleaning {{operations}} using {{abrasive blasting}} can present risks for workers' health and safety, specifically in portable air blasting or blast room (booth) applications. There {{is a large}} amount of dust created through abrasive blasting from the substrate and abrasive. Although many abrasives used in blasting rooms are not hazardous in themselves, (steel shot and grit, cast iron, aluminum oxide, garnet, plastic abrasive and glass bead), other abrasives (silica sand, copper slag, nickel slag, and staurolite) have varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>hazard</b> (typically free silica or heavy metals). However, in all cases their use can present serious danger to operators, such as burns due to projections (with skin or eye lesions), falls due to walking on round shot scattered on the ground, exposure to hazardous dusts, heat exhaustion, creation of an explosive atmosphere, and exposure to excessive noise. Blasting rooms and portable blaster's equipment have been adapted to these dangers. Blasting lead-based paint can fill the air with lead particles which can be harmful to the nervous system.|$|R
