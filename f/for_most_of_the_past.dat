25|$|<b>For</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> century {{patients}} with tubal infertility due to hydrosalpinx underwent tubal corrective surgery {{to open up}} the distally occluded end of the tubes (salpingostomy) and remove adhesions (adhesiolysis). Unfortunately, pregnancy rates tended to be low as the infection process often had permanently damaged the tubes, and in many cases hydrosalpinges and adhesions formed again. Further, ectopic pregnancy is a typical complication. Surgical interventions can be done by laparotomy or laparoscopy.|$|E
25|$|The 1992–93 {{season was}} a {{disappointment}} compared with the years before, with a 47–35 mark and 3rd place in the division. The center position, manned by Mark Eaton <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> decade, became suspect as he struggled with injuries and age. The bright spot was the hosting of the NBA All-Star Game and the surrounding events of All-Star Weekend. The Jazz lost to the Seattle SuperSonics in the first round, 3–2. During the postseason, the team addressed the center position by acquiring Felton Spencer from Minnesota, in return for backup center Mike Brown.|$|E

25|$|After ruling Mexico <b>for</b> <b>most</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>past</b> century, {{the return}} of the Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) brought hope to the {{supporters}} and fear to those remembering the old PRI tactics of making deals with the cartels in exchange for relative peace. According to an article published by The Economist on 23 June 2012, {{part of the reason why}} Peña Nieto and the PRI won lies in the disappointment of the rule of the National Action Party (PAN). Buffeted by China's economic growth and the economic recession in the United States, the annual growth of Mexico's economy between 2000 and 2012 was of 1.8%. Poverty worsened, and without a ruling majority in Congress, the PAN presidents were unable to pass structural reforms, leaving monopolies and Mexico's educational system unchanged. In 2006, Felipe Calderón chose to make the battle against organized crime the centerpiece of his presidency. Nonetheless, with over 60,000 dead, many Mexican citizens are tired of a fight they had first supported.|$|E
