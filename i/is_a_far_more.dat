25|$|The {{beginning}} of the 1980s saw the most unusual and uncharacteristic publication in DeLillo's career. The sports novel Amazons, a mock memoir of {{the first woman to}} play in the National Hockey League, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> lighthearted and more evidently commercial novel than his previous and subsequent novels. DeLillo published the novel under the pseudonym Cleo Birdwell, and later requested publishers compiling a bibliography for a reprint of a later novel to expunge the novel from their lists.|$|E

This <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> complex technique; it is invasive to the body due to the use of X-Ray radiation, catheters and angiographic contrast agents.|$|E
25|$|The {{mechanism}} for inflation is unclear, it {{is similar in}} effect to dark energy but <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> energetic and short lived process. As with dark energy the best explanation is some form of vacuum energy arising from quantum fluctuations. It may be that inflation caused baryogenesis, the hypothetical physical processes that produced an asymmetry (imbalance) between baryons and antibaryons produced {{in the very early}} universe, but this is far from certain.|$|E
25|$|In adulthood, {{individuals}} do not experience male-pattern baldness. As DHT <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> potent androgen than testosterone alone, virilization in those lacking DHT may be absent or reduced compared to males with functional 5-AR. It is hypothesized that rising testosterone levels {{at the start}} of puberty are able to generate sufficient levels of DHT either by the action of 5α-reductase type I (active in the adult liver, non-genital skin and some brain areas) or through the expression of low levels of 5α-reductase type II in the testes.|$|E

25|$|Most {{recreational}} and professional diver training organisations would consider relying on buddy breathing {{from a single}} regulator as an unacceptable risk, {{as the use of}} a secondary demand valve (octopus) or second regulator, either from an alternative scuba cylinder, or from the primary scuba set, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> reliable and safe method of supplying emergency air to a diver who is part of a planned team or buddy dive, and a solo diver should carry his/her own emergency gas supply. There should never be a situation on a well planned and executed dive where two divers need to share a single demand valve, but the technique is still considered useful by some diving schools as it teaches control and hones skills under difficult circumstances.|$|E
25|$|The {{view that}} occlusal trauma (as may occur during bruxism) is a causative factor in {{gingivitis}} and periodontitis is not widely accepted. It {{is thought that}} the periodontal ligament may respond to increased occlusal (biting) forces by resorbing some of the bone of the alveolar crest, which may result in increased tooth mobility, however these changes are reversible if the occlusal force is reduced. Tooth movement that occurs during occlusal loading is sometimes termed fremitus. It is generally accepted that increased occlusal forces are able to increase the rate of progression of pre-existing periodontal disease (gum disease), however the main stay treatment is plaque control rather than elaborate occlusal adjustments. It is also generally accepted that periodontal disease <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> common cause of tooth mobility and pathological tooth migration than any influence of bruxism, although bruxism may much less commonly be involved in both.|$|E
500|$|During her husband's 1968 presidential campaign, Lenore {{continued}} to exert a calming influence {{on him and}} helped keep his sometimes problematic temper in check. [...] She was adept at campaigning, appearing at ease and speaking in a lively, fluent manner without notes before audiences of various types. [...] The Associated Press wrote that she was probably [...] "the most indefatigable campaigner on the New Hampshire primary circuit, including the candidates". [...] The New York Times wrote, [...] "To see Mrs. George Romney in action is to watch an authentic, stand-up evangelist weave a spell. ... {{in the view of}} seasoned politicians, Lenore Romney <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> effective speaker than the wife of any national candidate in recent memory. She may even be among the select group of political wives who win votes for their husbands through their own speeches and contacts." [...] As the campaign went on, George fell far behind Republican rival Richard Nixon in polls and withdrew in February 1968 before the first primaries took place.|$|E

[...] "Kelefa Sanneh from The New York Times said that the concert was [...] "a dense, dizzying, often incoherent, sometimes exhilarating night, starring a great performer who often found herself shadowboxing with her own past lives." [...] Dan Aquilante from New York Post said that the concert [...] "razzle-dazzled her way into the hearts of the devoted audience with an entertaining theatrical revue that was elaborately staged, costumed and cast with a full dance troupe." [...] Thea Singer of the Boston Herald said that [...] "Madonna brought Jewish mysticism on tour." [...] John Hand from BBC noted that the [...] "Re-Invention Tour happily marrie past and present Madonna. [...] It <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> rounded concert experience for the dedicated fan." [...] However Robert Hilburn from Los Angeles Times felt that the show eventually took on a darker, more political tone and condemned the [...] "weakly political Re-Invention concert [...] unsexy and uninspiring." ...|$|E
500|$|Upon {{the news}} of Francis' casting, Sara Bibel of Xfinity wrote that the soap opera had [...] "finally {{mastered}} the art of stunt casting". She also stated that seeing Francis paired with Tristan Rogers [...] "will be delicious", and that she thought [...] "we can all agree this <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> exciting addition to the show than Eric Roberts or Sean Young". She gave [...] "kudos" [...] to the soap opera for creating [...] "what is sure to be must-see daytime TV". When news broke of Francis' dismissal, Bibel wrote: [...] "Francis's character, Genevieve, was, to put it mildly, not an audience favorite. She started out as a dark psychopath hellbent on revenge then, when that persona made the character less than viable over the longterm, morphed overnight into an aspiring business woman. Neither incarnation played to Francis’s strengths as an actress." [...] Omar White-Nobles of TVSource wrote: [...] "Genevieve was determined to bring down her crime lord husband Colin (Tristan Rogers) and attempt to reconcile with her son. Unfortunately for Francis, playing a vengeful ice queen turned shrewd businesswoman didn’t work for the audience. Subsequent attempts to soften the character failed as well, leaving aborted pairings with Jack Abbott (Peter Bergman) and Victor Newman (Eric Braeden)." ...|$|E
500|$|The Bajorans {{have been}} {{described}} as analogues for a variety of displaced peoples, with Star Trek novelist Keith DeCandido comparing them to [...] "Palestinians, Jews, Kurds, Haitians; the sad reality is that you can pretty much pick and choose. History is full of people who have had their homes taken from them, forced to become refugees." [...] The Cardassian occupation of Bajor (the Bajoran homeworld) has been compared to the Holocaust, with Ro singled out as a Holocaust survivor. In his chapter [...] "Speakers for the Dead: Star Trek, the Holocaust, and the Representation of Atrocity" [...] within the book Star Trek as Myth, writer Matthew Wilheim Kapell compared the experiences and reactions of Ro Laren and Kira Nerys following the Cardassian occupation of Bajor. He said that the impact on Ro represented the [...] "non-american view of the holocaust" [...] in that she does not fully recover from the trauma and continues to affect in, for example preventing her from connecting with her religious beliefs in [...] "The Next Phase". He explains that Kira <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> [...] "Americanize" [...] character, acting as a [...] "resister and even liberator" [...] during the occupation. As a result, unlike Ro, Kira retains her religious beliefs and does not typically show any ongoing emotional trauma. Further commentary of Ro's relationship to religion have been made. In The Literary Galaxy of Star Trek, James F. Broderick compared the situation in which Ro and La Forge are trapped out of phase in [...] "The Next Phase" [...] to that of the purgatory dweller in Dante Alighieri's Inferno.|$|E
