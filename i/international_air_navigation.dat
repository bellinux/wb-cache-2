40|$|Since 1993, {{the civil}} {{aviation}} community through RTCA (Radio Technical Commission for Aeronautics) and the ICAO (<b>International</b> Civil <b>Air</b> <b>Navigation</b> Organization) {{have been working}} on the definition of GNSS augmentation systems that will provide improved levels of accuracy and integrity. These augmentation systems have been classified into three distinct groups: Aircraft Based Augmentation Systems (ABAS), Space Based Augmentation Systems (SBAS) and Ground Based Augmentation Systems (GBAS). The last one is an implemented system to support <b>Air</b> <b>Navigation</b> in CAT-I approaching operation. It consists of three primary subsystems: the GNSS Satellite subsystem that produces the ranging signals and navigation messages; the GBAS ground subsystem, which uses two or more GNSS receivers. It collects pseudo ranges for all GNSS satellites in view and computes and broadcasts differential corrections and integrity-related information; the Aircraft subsystem. Within the area of coverage of the ground station, aircraft subsystems may use the broadcast corrections to compute their own measurements in line with the differential principle. After selection of the desired FAS for the landing runway, the differentially corrected position is used to generate navigation guidance signals. Those are lateral and vertical deviations as well as distance to the threshold crossing point of the selected FAS and integrity flags. The Department of Applied Science in Naples has create for its study a virtual GBAS Ground station. Starting from three GPS double frequency receivers, we collect data of 24 h measures session and in post processing we generate the GC (GBAS Correction). For this goal we use the software Pegasus V 4. 1 developed from EUROCONTROL.

5000|$|The {{first use}} of {{aircraft}} registrations {{was based on the}} radio callsigns allocated at the London International Radiotelegraphic Conference in 1913. The format was a single letter prefix followed by four other letters (like A-BCDE). The major nations operating aircraft were allocated a single letter prefix. Smaller countries had to share a single letter prefix, but were allocated exclusive use of the first letter of the suffix. This was modified by agreement by the International Bureau at Berne and published on April 23, 1913. Although initial allocations were not specifically for aircraft but for any radio user, the <b>International</b> <b>Air</b> <b>Navigation</b> Convention held in Paris in 1919 (Paris Convention of 1919) made allocations specifically for aircraft registrations, based on the 1913 callsign list. The agreement stipulated that the nationality marks were to be followed by a hyphen then a group of four letters that must include a vowel (and for the convention Y was considered to be a vowel).
