5|$|The {{situation}} that arose after the <b>incapacity</b> of President Wilson, for which Marshall's vice-presidency is most remembered, revived {{the national debate}} {{on the process of}} presidential succession. The topic was already being discussed when Wilson left for Europe, which influenced him to allow Marshall to conduct cabinet meetings in his absence. Wilson's <b>incapacity</b> during 1919 and the lack of action by Marshall made it a major issue. The constitutional flaws in the process of presidential succession had been known since the death of President William Henry Harrison in 1841, but little progress had been made passing a constitutional amendment to remedy the problem. Nearly fifty years later, the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution was passed, allowing the vice president to assume the presidential powers and duties any time the president was rendered incapable of carrying out the powers and duties of the office.|$|E
40|$|Introduction: The work {{deals with}} disease {{consequences}} concerning ICD and „bio-psycho-social-model” of ICF {{in relation to}} mental disorders. In order to describe the interface between impairments and participation restrictions more satisfying, we developed a new assessment tool – the “Mini-ICF-APP”. Examined are the occurrence of <b>incapacities,</b> changes during time and relationships between impairments, <b>incapacities</b> and participation restrictions as well as sociodemographic and motivational influences. Methods: <b>Incapacities</b> were measured in 213 patients admitted to the Department of Behavioral Medicine using the Mini-ICF-APP. The assessment was done twice (at admission and discharge), parallel and independently from each other by therapists and a trained rater. Different self-ratings and a clinical interview were used to capture work performance, motivational and volitional problems in regard to {{work as well as}} mental conditions. Results: Nearly all patients showed <b>incapacities,</b> although of slight strength. Problems occurred mainly in flexibility. There were no differences in level of <b>incapacities</b> concerning sociodemographic variables. Significant interrelations between psychopathology and <b>incapacities</b> {{on the one hand and}} duration of sick leave (participation restriction) on the other hand were found, while psychopathology and sick leave did not correlate. <b>Incapacities</b> can be assessed and conceptualized independently of work-related attitudes and motivation. We found significant and relevant correlations with capacities and performance, but not between capacities and attitudes. At the end of treatment <b>incapacities</b> reductions could be found for all dimensions of the Mini-ICF-APP. Differences were examined concerning work status as well as complexity of mental disorders. Discussion: To describe a disease one should use ICD and ICF together. But previously definitions of ICF have to be clarified. The Mini-ICF-APP can be used to rate <b>incapacities</b> in mental disorders reliable and economic. The average impairments are in accordance with the examined sample in psychosomatic rehabilitation, where disease spectrum and severity levels are restricted. Psychopathology canÂŽt be equated with sick leave. <b>Incapacities</b> have to be derived out of psychopathological findings. After that, one has to square the impairments with occupational role requirements. After that one can justify sick leave. The data support the notion that <b>incapacities</b> are relatively more important in explaining work-related problems than work-related attitudes. It can be assumed that many patients who cannot work would love to work. The success of rehabilitation depends on point of illness process, kind of disease and additional person factors. Apart from recovery of capacity to work, rehabilitation could also be useful in order to improve participation in social life...|$|R

Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the Prince of Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority.

5|$|Abu Nuwar {{became a}} vociferous critic of British aid to Jordan, viewing it {{as a form}} of {{dependency}} on Jordan's former colonial ruler, and of Glubb Pasha, the influential British officer in charge of the Arab Legion who was derided by Arab nationalists as a symbol of lingering British colonialism in Jordan. When Abdullah I was assassinated in 1951, Glubb and Prime Minister Tawfik Abu al-Huda's government discussed preventing Abdullah's son and heir apparent, Emir Talal, a sympathizer of the Free Officers, from being enthroned; Talal had been checked into a mental institution in Switzerland, but many Free Officers believed the British were fabricating Talal's mental illness to keep him out of Jordan. In response, Abu Nuwar sought to install Talal on the throne by force, and to that end he appealed for support from the Free Officers and sent Awni Hannun, a Jordanian military doctor, to bring Talal to Jordan. However, Hannun was forbidden from meeting Talal due to visitation restrictions and was dismissed by Glubb for alleged incitement against British interests. Nonetheless, Talal was enthroned, and Abu Nuwar subsequently urged him to dismiss Glubb. The latter feared Abu Nuwar's efforts posed a threat to British interests in Jordan, and thus directed Abu al-Huda's government to effectively exile Abu Nuwar from the country. The government complied, dispatching Abu Nuwar to Paris to serve as Jordan's military attaché in September 1952.
