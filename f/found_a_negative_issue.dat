Top management’s willingness to strategically allow new ideas to be experimented will aid the MO and CSR development process in firms. In the same vein, if top management is always searching for certainty before making decisions, it could stifle MO and CSR initiatives. Intelligence generation, intelligence dissemination and intelligence responsiveness, {{as well as}} the marketing culture of an organisation, are all influenced by top management’s risk aversion. In more elaborate terms, one can postulate that top management’s risk aversion has an influence on the economic, legal, ethical, philanthropic, social and environmental performance of an organisation.

40|$|The paper {{critically}} {{reviews the}} literature concerning {{the effect of}} ankle bracing and taping on vertical jump, agility, running speed, and broad jump performance. MEDLINE, CINAHL and SPORTDiscus were searched for papers published between 1988 and June 2003. The following keywords were used: performance, running, jump, agility, speed, brace, orthotic devices, tape, taping, ankle. References of retrieved articles were screened for additional relevant studies. Studies were eligible if they reported {{on the effect of}} an ankle support on vertical jump, running, agility or broad jump. Only studies that were written as full reports and had been published in the English language were included. Data on the effect of the ankle support on vertical jump, running speed, agility and/or broad jump performance were abstracted from the text and tables. Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Of twelve studies looking at vertical jump, four <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> effect on the vertical jump using different types of ankle braces or adhesive tape. One study <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> effect on running speed; three studies <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> effect on time to complete an agility course. In one study, broad jump performance was shown to be adversely affected while wearing a brace. In two studies subjects with ankle injuries completed the agility course faster when wearing an ankle brace. The majority of studies indicated that ankle bracing or taping has no effect or only a minor effect on vertical jump height, running speed, agility and broad jump in athletes with stable ankles. Further study is necessary to examine the effect of prolonged ankle brace use on athletic performance. In addition, more research is necessary to investigate the effect of an ankle support in subjects with an ankle injury. Keywords: Bot S, Verhagen E, van Mechelen...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{performed}} a systematic and critical review of published studies investigating potential associations between race and/or ethnicity {{and use of}} HIV-related medications, including antiretroviral medications and medications used for prophylaxis of opportunistic infections. METHODS: The authors conducted a Web-based search of the University of California MEDLINE/HealthSTAR database for articles published from January 1, 1985, to October 31, 2001. References cited in articles were used to identify potential additional articles for this review. The authors reviewed articles published in peer-reviewed scientific journals that analyzed race/ethnicity {{as a predictor of}} antiretroviral or HIV-related prophylactic medication use. RESULTS: The authors identified 28 reports, including: (a) 26 studies published in 1991 - 2001 that addressed antiretroviral use, spanning data collection periods from 1984 to 1999; (b) 11 studies published in 1994 - 2001 that addressed prophylaxis for Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia (PCP), reporting on data collected from 1989 to 1998; and (c) three studies published from 1998 to 2001 that addressed prophylaxis for other opportunistic infections, reporting on data collected from 1993 to 1998. Among the studies that addressed antiretroviral use, 14 <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> association between non-white race and at least one measure of antiretroviral use, three studies <b>found</b> <b>a</b> positive association, and 16 studies found no association; seven studies found mixed results across several measures of antiretroviral use. Only four of 11 studies <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> association between race/ethnicity and PCP prophylaxis; the remainder found no association. Two out of three studies <b>found</b> <b>a</b> <b>negative</b> association between race/ethnicity and prophylaxis for other infections. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence of racial/ethnic disparities in utilization of antiretrovirals, which are known to be strongly associated with positive HIV health outcomes. It is now imperative for researchers and policy makers to better understand the causes of these disparities, evaluate programs that affect the delivery of HIV medications, and implement program and policy changes necessary to address the disparities...|$|R
