500|$|Van Vleet {{remained}} {{loyal to}} his local Rockford Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) club team rather than accept offers to more high-profile teams in Chicago. Van Vleet {{did not feel}} {{it would make a}} difference in his recruiting: [...] "As long as you're leading whoever you're playing with, the coaches are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that.</b> If they see you competing and winning with guys maybe I shouldn't be winning with, that's maybe even an advantage for me." [...] He received basketball scholarship offers from Colorado State, Northern Illinois, Southern Illinois, Drake, Detroit and Kent State. His stepfather felt that he was being overlooked by many Chicago metropolitan area schools because of his decision not to join a Chicago AAU team. He cut his list down to Kent State, Northern Illinois and Wichita State. When he accepted an offer to play for Wichita State, he became {{the only member of the}} national class of 2012 Rivals.com top 150 to attend a Missouri Valley Conference school.|$|E

60|$|But Mrs Nickleby {{was not to}} be {{so easily}} moved, for first she insisted on <b>going</b> upstairs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> nothing had been left, and then on <b>going</b> downstairs <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> {{everything}} had been taken away; and when she was getting into the coach she had a vision of a forgotten coffee-pot on the back-kitchen hob, and after she was shut in, a dismal recollection of a green umbrella behind some unknown door. At last Nicholas, in a condition of absolute despair, ordered the coachman to drive away, and in the unexpected jerk of a sudden starting, Mrs Nickleby lost a shilling among the straw, which fortunately confined her attention to the coach {{until it was too late}} to remember anything else.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes. There's {{one point}} where the old Cosmop slips up badly, and I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>that</b> it's {{corrected}} at my little shack.

60|$|I {{thought she}} must be walking in her sleep, but I crawled {{out of bed and}} got into a dressing-gown. I knew Aunt Agatha well enough to know that, if she had come <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me, she was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> me. <b>That's</b> the sort of woman she is.|$|R

500|$|George and May {{had five}} {{sons and a}} daughter.
