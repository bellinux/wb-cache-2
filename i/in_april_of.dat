5|$|By 1934, the club's average {{attendance}} {{had risen}} to over 23,000, which allowed the club manager, Tom Mather, more transfer funds. Despite this, {{the core of the}} side consisted of young local players, such as Matthews, Tommy Sale and Freddie Steele. Mathers resigned from his post in May 1935 to take the managerial job at Newcastle United, ending his 12-year tenure. Bob McGrory was appointed as the club's manager shortly afterward; he had previously played for the club for 14 years. In the 1935–36 season, the club finished fourth in the Football League First Division, nine points adrift of champions Sunderland. This was followed by two successive mid-table finishes, in 1936–37 and 1937–38. The club recorded its record league win, 10–3, over West Bromwich Albion in February 1937, in which Steele scored five goals. <b>In</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year, the club achieved its largest league crowd—51,373 against Arsenal. Steele's 33 league goals in the 1936–37 season remains a club record in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Danny Bergara was {{appointed}} as manager in March 1989, quickly transforming the team, and automatic promotion was gained in 1990–91. The next three seasons saw Stockport make the play-offs, {{but failed to}} result in another promotion. In March 1995 Bergara was sacked after an altercation with then-chairman Brendan Elwood, and Dave Jones {{was appointed}} manager <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year. A new all-seater, Cheadle End, holding just over 5,000 in capacity, was opened {{at the start of}} the 1995–96 season. Although this particular season was unremarkable, the club reached the third round of the FA Cup, where they faced holders Everton. Stockport reached a 2–2 draw with Everton at Goodison Park, and for the replay ten days later over 11,000 gathered at Edgeley Park to witness Everton's late winner in a 3–2 victory.|$|E
5|$|Delivered to the Navy on January 30, 1937, the {{aircraft}} was officially {{presented to the}} public at Hall's Bristol, Pennsylvania factory <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year. The aircraft's early flight testing, starting in February and conducted by test pilot Bill McAvoy, showed that the XPTBH had few faults, with the only significant issue being a lack of roll authority – a reduction of the ability of the ailerons to turn {{the aircraft}} – {{as a result of the}} surface area of the floats. A modification to increase the area of the rudder solved the issue. The aircraft's water-handling characteristics were found to be excellent; the only significant complaints that surfaced during the testing period concerned the XPTBH-2's beaching gear, which was found to be extremely difficult to use in anything other than the calmest water.|$|E

5|$|In 1953, CWC {{became a}} member of the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA). During this time, CWC wrestlers could compete for championships {{operated}} by the NWA. In 1958, the CWC created the United States Tag Team Championship (the first title ever owned by WWE), which inaugural champions Mark Lewin and Don Curtis won <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year. In 1963, CWC was renamed as the WWWF and ended its partnership with the NWA. To reflect the changes, the WWWF introduced its world heavyweight championship (WWE's second overall championship and the current WWE Championship), while the WWWF acronym was added to the United States Tag Team Titles. The titles were disbanded in 1967 without a formal announcement by the WWWF, and thus, the first tag team championship (and first championship overall) to be retired by the promotion. Ten years later, the company retired its first individually contested title, the WWWF United States Heavyweight Championship, also without a formal announcement.|$|E
5|$|In February 1999, Payton {{announced}} that he had a rare autoimmune liver disease known as primary sclerosing cholangitis, which may have led to his cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer). He spent his final months as an advocate for organ transplants, appearing in many commercials to encourage others to donate organs, although by the time his first appeal was recorded, his illness was already too far advanced for transplantation to have been a viable option. <b>In</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year, Payton made a final public appearance at a Chicago Cubs game with Mike Ditka, where he threw the game's ceremonial first pitch. Author Don Yaeger worked with him during the last weeks of his life to create his autobiography, Never Die Easy.|$|E
5|$|In January 1956 Hope {{recorded}} with another rising star, Jackie McLean, for the saxophonist's Lights Out! <b>In</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> {{the same year}} Hope should have appeared on saxophonist Gene Ammons' The Happy Blues, but he left the record company's building before the session began and did not return. Hope claimed that {{he had gone to}} visit an aunt in hospital, but his absence was attributed by others to his heroin addiction. This had existed on and off for several years, and had led to at least one spell in prison. His drug problem and associated criminal record led to the withdrawal of Hope's New York City Cabaret Card around 1956, so he was no longer permitted to play in clubs in the city.|$|E

5|$|In late 1960, the Alaska Conservation Society {{became the}} first large {{conservation}} group to oppose construction of the dam. The organization believed the flooding of the Yukon Flats would cause critical damage to Alaska waterfowl and promoted the alternative Susitna Hydroelectric Project to supply Alaska's electric needs. This was followed in early 1961 by an Alaska Sportsmen's Council resolution that criticized the Corps of Engineers for reducing its funding for studies {{of the impact of}} the project on fish and game stocks. <b>In</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year, Alaska Sportsman magazine took a formal stand against the project.|$|E
5|$|Modern Sounds in Country and Western Music is {{a studio}} album by American R singer-songwriter and {{musician}} Ray Charles. It was recorded by Charles in February 1962 at Capitol Studios in New York City and at United Recording Studios in Hollywood, before being released <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year by ABC-Paramount Records. The album departed stylistically from the singer's previous {{rhythm and blues}} music. It featured country, folk, and Western music standards reworked by Charles in popular song forms of the time, including R, pop, and jazz.|$|E
5|$|Nickel, {{formerly}} {{used in the}} cent, now had {{no place}} in American coinage. This was unsatisfactory to Wharton, who sought its return. Although Pollock {{made no mention of}} further nickel coinage in his 1864 annual report, Wharton <b>in</b> <b>April</b> <b>of</b> that year published a pamphlet proposing that all non-precious metal coinage be composed of 75% copper and 25% nickel. The copper-nickel cents had contained only 12% nickel, and even so had been difficult for the Mint to strike due to the hardness of the metal, the use of which damaged equipment and quickly broke dies. An alloy of 25% nickel would be even more difficult to coin. Wharton argued that the tough alloy would be difficult to counterfeit.|$|E
