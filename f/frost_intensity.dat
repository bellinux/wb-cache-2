40|$|Frost is {{a natural}} hazard, which may cause {{significant}} damage to agriculture depending also on the phenological stage of the affected crops. In this paper, several features of the frost-affected areas are examined by using digital data of METEOSAT IR images. In particular the areal extent of frost is delineated by using the estimated temperature from the raw satellite data. Moreover, since digital METEOSAT IR images are recorded every thirty (30) minutes, {{it is possible to}} monitor the changes {{in the size of the}} frost-affected areas as well as the fluctuations in <b>frost</b> <b>intensity</b> and severity. The phenomenon is investigated in several regions in Greece...|$|E
40|$|Frost on roadways {{and bridges}} can present {{hazardous}} conditions to motorists, {{particularly when it}} occurs in patches or on bridges when adjacent roadways are clear of frost. To minimize materials costs, vehicle corrosion, and negative environmental impacts, frost-suppression chemicals should be applied only when, where, and in the appropriate amounts needed to maintain roadways in a safe condition for motorists. Accurate forecasts of frost onset times, <b>frost</b> <b>intensity,</b> and frost disappearance (e. g., melting or sublimation) are needed to help roadway maintenance personnel decide when, where, and how much frost-suppression chemical to use. A finite-difference algorithm (BridgeT) has been developed that simulates vertical heat transfer in a bridge based on evolving meteorological conditions at its top and bottom as supplied by a weather forecast model. BridgeT simulates bridge temperatures at numerous points within the bridge (including its upper and lower surface) at each time step of the weather forecast model and calculates volume per unit area (i. e., depth) of deposited, melted, or sublimed frost. This model produces forecasts of bridge surface temperature, frost depth, and bridge condition (i. e., dry, wet, icy/snowy). Bridge frost predictions and bridge surface temperature are compared with observed and measured values to assess BridgeT 2 ̆ 7 s skill in forecasting bridge frost and associated conditions...|$|E
40|$|In many areas, low {{temperature}} {{is an important}} environmental limiting factor in production and distribution of horticultural trees and plants. This {{study was conducted to}} study the frost tolerance of main local clones of cornelian cherry in Tarom Sofla region, Qazvin, Iran. Cold treatments at 5 levels (+ 4, + 2, 0, - 2 and - 4 ˚C) at two cooling periods (3 and 5 hours) were arranged as a factorial experiment, based on completely randomized design with 4 replications, at flowering stage of Golabie Siah (black pear) and Paeizi (autumn) clones in 2009 - 2010. For each treatment, the electrical conductivity (EC) and acidity (pH) were measured just after shaking (t= 0), every 3 hours in the first 24 hours, and once daily in the 2 nd to 8 th day. After a week, the samples were autoclaved at 105 ˚C for 4 minutes and the changes were recorded. Results showed that the range of EC in flower was 92. 2 - 846. 2 µS/cm, and the range of pH varied from 6. 4 to 7. 7. Based on the results, the effect of <b>frost</b> <b>intensity</b> on EC changes was ascending, and on pH was slowly ascending and sometimes fixed. The highest value of EC due to destruction of tissues, as an index of frost damage of the flower, was obtained at + 4 ˚C. Therefore, tolerance range of cornelian cherry flower has been estimated to be more than + 4 ˚C...|$|E

This study is primarily concerned with factors that influence planting date and variety selection.

The approach is used both with and without the possible occurrence of harmful spring frosts. The 2 ̆ 2 seventy growing degree day 2 ̆ 2 method is employed as a criterion for planting date selection.

40|$|The triumvirate of tectonics, lithology, {{and climate}} control {{landscape}} evolution. This study quantifies how lithologic variation and climate-mediated changes in ecosystems perturb steady state {{processes in the}} unglaciated, soil-mantled Oregon Coast Range (OCR). I first demonstrate that minor grain-scale differences in rock properties in a seemingly uniform sandstone control differences in rock strength, biotic bedrock-to-soil production efficacy, and erosion rates and influence relief at the watershed scale. I then build on sedimentology, paleoecology, and isotopic-derived paleoerosion data I collected from a new 50 ka sediment archive at Little Lake, OR to explore climate controls on soil production and erosion rates 21 ka across the OCR and spanning 50 ky within a single watershed. In Chapter III, I combine a mechanistic frost weathering model with a regional Last Glacial Maximum (LGM) climate reconstruction and paleovegetation data to demonstrate that accelerated frost-driven erosion was pervasive across the OCR during the LGM. My findings provide a new framework to quantify how the late Pleistocene affects modern erosion and soil formation rates in unglaciated environments and implies that most landscapes reside in a transient state. In Chapter IV, I document climate-mediated ecosystem influence on erosion rates over 3 climatic intervals. 10 Be-derived erosion rates increase 3 x (from 0. 6 mm/yr to 0. 21 mm/yr) as the OCR transitioned from the open forest-dominated marine isotope stage (MIS) climate interval (50 - 26 ka) into the periglacial subalpine MIS 2 glacial interval (26 - 13 ka). Measured erosion rates fell {{by more than half}} as the subalpine ecosystem gave way to the modern MIS 1 closed canopy Douglas-fir forest. Coupling paleovegetation-derived climate information with core observations I model <b>frost</b> weathering <b>intensity</b> from ~ 43 ka to 21 ka and establish a correspondence with increasing <b>frost</b> weathering <b>intensity</b> and increasing 10 Be-derived erosion rates. Utilizing a transient mixing depth and erosion rate model, I am able to broadly replicate measured erosion rates at Little Lake through time. My findings contradict previous work that suggests climate has only weak control on erosion rates. This dissertation includes previously published and unpublished co-authored material...|$|R
40|$|O objetivo deste trabalho foi avaliar a influência da aclimatação, da intensidade de geada e da disponibilidade hídrica sobre os danos causados pela geada em trigo. Os experimentos foram conduzidos em telados, com trigo cultivado em vasos. A aclimatação e a incidência de geada foram simuladas em câmaras de crescimento. Os fatores abióticos avaliados foram: regimes de aclimatação (com e sem); gradiente de temperatura (2, - 2, - 4 e - 7 °C); e variação de disponibilidade hídrica no solo, antes da geada (9, 6, 3 e 1 dia sem irrigação). Todos os fatores foram avaliados no afilhamento, alongamento e espigamento das cultivares: BR- 18 Terena, mais tolerante à geada; e BRS 194, menos tolerante. As variáveis avaliadas foram: grau de queima de folhas, sete dias após a geada; massa de matéria seca total; e massa de grãos. A aclimatação do trigo, antes da geada, diminuiu os danos provocados antes do espigamento, e resultou em menor queima de folhas e maior rendimento de grãos. A temperatura de - 7 °C, no espigamento, resultou em falha na produção de grãos de ambas as cultivares; e os prejuízos com geada foram menores nas plantas com nove dias sem irrigação. As condições anteriores à ocorrência de geada têm influência sobre os danos provocados por ela. The {{objective}} of this work was to evaluate the influence of acclimatization, <b>frost</b> <b>intensity</b> and soil water availability on damage caused by frost on wheat. The experiments were carried out in screen house conditions. The wheat plants were grown in pots. The acclimatization and frost incidence were simulated in a growth chamber. The abiotic factors evaluated were: acclimatization regimes (with and without); temperature gradient (2, - 2, - 4 and - 7 °C) and variation of soil water availability prior to frost incidence (9, 6, 3 and 1 day without irrigation). All factors were evaluated at tillering, stem elongation and heading stage on wheat cultivars BR- 18 Terena, more tolerant to frost, and BRS 194, less tolerant. The response variables were: degree of leaf scorching symptoms at 7 days after frost; total dry weight; and grain weight. The acclimatization, before frost, decreased the damage caused on wheat heading stage, which resulted in less leaf scorching symptoms and higher grain yield. Temperature of - 7 °C, at heading stage, resulted in grain set failure in both cultivars; and frost damage was lower in plants with nine days without irrigation. Prevailing conditions before frost influence frost damage...|$|E
40|$|The major {{purpose of}} this study is to make {{additional}} information available to the farm manager through the use of decision theory. This will enable him to improve the decision-making process relating to corn production. The goal is to use the resources at his disposal more efficiently and profitably. This study is primarily concerned with factors that influence planting date and corn variety selection. Within the framework of decision theory analysis, prior and posterior probabilities are employed to calculate the losses that may occur to corn crops in the Cache Valley area of Utah because of harmful spring frosts under optional corn varieties. The alternative of replanting is also added to the model. A brief discussion is included regard ing the impact of water shortage on planting date and corn variety selection. A discussion of factors influencing harvesting decisions is included. The 2 ̆ 2 seventy growing degree day 2 ̆ 2 method is employed as a criterion for planting date select ion. The planting dates a r e matched with four different season length Utah hybrid corn varieties to formulate the courses of action available to the farm manager. The states of nature are the degrees of damage that would occur due to various <b>frost</b> <b>intensities.</b> The decision theory approach of this study identifies the short season variety as the optimal corn crop for Cache Valley, unless planting can be done during the first week in May. This study indicates that planting a shorter season vadety than most Cache Valley farmers have been using in the past would be profitable. Replanting after a frost is found to be unprofitable in marginal cases, but necessary in the case of a killing frost of sufficient duration. The problem of a short water supply adds a constraint as to what varieties can be planted where the time required to reach the third stage of growth is most critical in obtaining potential yields. Finally, it was found that the risk of increased precipitation interfering with harvesting operations becomes almost a certainty if attempts to lengthen the season pushes the harvest too far in to October...|$|R
40|$|Downslope {{boundaries}} of forest with grassland and grassy woodland occur {{over a wide}} altitudinal range in central Tasmania. Three sites were selected for study {{of the causes of}} these boundaries at low, medium and high elevations. The open vegetation was generally associated with moister and less rocky soils and more subdued topography than the adjacent forest. <b>Frost</b> incidence and <b>intensity,</b> soil moisture and waterlogging varied markedly among the three open areas. Planted tree seedlings survived 4 years in the open at all sites, and seedlings established in the open both naturally, and after sowing, where grass competition was reduced by herbicide application, digging or root competition from adult eucalypts. Grazing had no detectable effect on seedling establishment. A pot experiment demonstrated a suppressive effect of native grass swards on both seedling establishment and growth, this effect being largely independent of available moisture and nutrients. While frost, waterlogging, fire and drought {{may play a role in}} inhibiting eucalypt establishment and increasing eucalypt mortality at some or all of the sites, the dense grass swards found in all the open areas are considered to be the most likely primary agent of tree exclusion...|$|R
40|$|Crop frost, {{one kind}} of agro-meteorological disaster, often causes {{significant}} loss to agriculture. Thus, evaluating the risk of wheat frost aids scientific response to such disasters, which will ultimately promote food security. Therefore, this paper aims to propose an integrated risk assessment model of wheat frost, based on meteorological data and a hybrid fuzzy neural network model, taking China as an example. With {{the support of a}} geographic information system (GIS), a comprehensive method was put forward. Firstly, threshold temperatures of wheat frost at three growth stages were proposed, referring to phenology in different wheat growing areas and the meteorological standard of Degree of Crop Frost Damage (QX/T 88 - 2008). Secondly, a vulnerability curve illustrating the relationship between <b>frost</b> hazard <b>intensity</b> and wheat yield loss was worked out using hybrid fuzzy neural network model. Finally, the wheat frost risk was assessed in China. Results show that our proposed threshold temperatures are more suitable than using 0 °C in revealing the spatial pattern of frost occurrence, and hybrid fuzzy neural network model can further improve the accuracy of the vulnerability curve of wheat subject to frost with limited historical hazard records. Both these advantages ensure the precision of wheat frost risk assessment. In China, frost widely distributes in 85. 00 % of the total winter wheat planting area, but mainly to the north of 35 °N; the southern boundary of wheat frost has moved northward, potentially because of the warming climate. There is a significant trend that suggests high risk areas will enlarge and gradually expand to the south, with the risk levels increasing from a return period of 2 years to 20 years. Among all wheat frost risk levels, the regions with loss rate ranges from 35. 00 % to 45. 00 % account for the largest area proportion, ranging from 58. 60 % to 63. 27 %. We argue that for wheat and other frost-affected crops, it is necessary to take the risk level, physical exposure, and growth stages of crops into consideration together for frost disaster risk prevention planning...|$|R
40|$|In the Southern Alps, New Zealand, large {{gradients}} in precipitation (< 1 to 12 m year− 1) {{and rock}} uplift (< 1 to 10 mm year− 1) produce distinct post-glacial geomorphic domains in which landslide-driven sediment production dominates in the wet, rapid-uplift western region, and rockfall controls erosion in the drier, low-uplift eastern region. Because the western region accounts for < 25 % {{of the active}} orogen, the dynamics of erosion in the extensive eastern region are of equal importance in estimating the relative balance of uplift and erosion across the Southern Alps. Here, we assess the efficacy of frost cracking as the primary rockfall mechanism in the eastern Southern Alps using air photo and topographic analysis of scree slopes, cosmogenic radionuclide dating of headwalls, paleo-climate data, and a numerical model of headwall temperature. Currently, active scree slopes occur at a relatively uniform mean elevation (1450 m) and their distribution is independent of hillslope aspect and rock type, consistent {{with the notion that}} frost cracking (which is maximized between − 3 and − 8 °C) may control rockfall erosion. Headwall erosion rates of 0. 3 to 0. 9 mm year− 1, measured using in-situ 10 Be and 26 Al in the Cragieburn Range, confirm that rockfall erosion is active in the late Holocene at rates that roughly balance rock uplift. Models of the predicted depth of frost activity are consistent with the scale of fractures and scree blocks in our field sites. Also, vegetated, paleo-scree slopes are ubiquitous at elevations lower than active scree slopes, consistent with the notion that lower temperatures during the last glacial advance induced pervasive rockfall erosion due to frost cracking. Our modeling suggests temporally-averaged peak <b>frost</b> cracking <b>intensity</b> occurs at 2300 m a. s. l., the approximate elevation of the highest peaks in the central Southern Alps, suggesting that the height of these peaks may be limited by a “frost buzzsaw. ...|$|R
40|$|Rivers cut {{vertically}} and laterally into bedrock. However, {{control on}} the width of bedrock rivers is an unsolved problem. In alpine settings, frost cracking {{is one of the}} mechanisms that break down bedrock. Segregation ice drives growth of ice lenses within rock masses. When the temperature of the rock is within the "frost cracking window" of - 3 to - 8 ??C, ice lenses can attract liquid water. Expanding ice lenses can exert sufficient pressure to fracture the rock. We hypothesize that alpine rivers may promote segregation ice growth at the river margin by supplying water, but also may inhibit frost cracking by supplying heat. We find support for this hypothesis in data collected along the Tuolumne and Mokelumne rivers in the Sierra Nevada, California. A ID heat flow model predicts that frost cracking should occur above 2325 masl in this area. To test for a river effect, I measured fracture density along the Tuolumne River at 2600 masl, finding that density at the river margin is significantly greater than on adjacent hillslopes in the Cathedral Peak granodiorite. We then deployed data loggers on the Mokelumne River (at 2490 masl) over the winter of 2013 / 2014 to record water, surface and subsurface rock temperatures at varying depths and distances from the river. Temperatures within the frost cracking window were only recorded at a distance of 5 m from the river, suggesting an insulating effect from the river and snow cover. Rock temperature 1 m deep equilibrated at 2 ??C. This result requires subsurface heat flow into the model space. Ongoing work includes terrestrial LiDAR scans to detect erosion of the river bank at the Mokelumne site, and further development of a 2 D heat flow model to predict subsurface rock temperatures for varying surface boundary conditions and channel morphology. We expect that further analysis will reveal systematic relationships between the surface boundary conditions and rock temperature at depth, enabling predictive modeling of <b>frost</b> cracking <b>intensity</b> at the river margin...|$|R
40|$|Mangroves are {{species of}} {{halophytic}} intertidal {{trees and shrubs}} derived from tropical genera and are likely delimited in latitudinal range by varying sensitivity to cold. There is now sufficient evidence that mangrove species have proliferated at or near their poleward limits on at least five continents over the past half century, {{at the expense of}} salt marsh. Avicennia is the most cold-tolerant genus worldwide, and is the subject of most of the observed changes. Avicennia germinans has extended in range along the USA Atlantic coast and expanded into salt marsh as a consequence of lower <b>frost</b> frequency and <b>intensity</b> in the southern USA. The genus has also expanded into salt marsh at its southern limit in Peru, and on the Pacific coast of Mexico. Mangroves of several species have expanded in extent and replaced salt marsh where protected within mangrove reserves in Guangdong Province, China. In south-eastern Australia, the expansion of Avicennia marina into salt marshes is now well documented, and Rhizophora stylosa has extended its range southward, while showing strong population growth within estuaries along its southern limits in northern New South Wales. Avicennia marina has extended its range southwards in South Africa. The changes are consistent with the poleward extension of temperature thresholds coincident with sea-level rise, although the specific mechanism of range extension might be complicated by limitations on dispersal or other factors. The shift from salt marsh to mangrove dominance on subtropical and temperate shorelines has important implications for ecological structure, function, and global change adaptation. 11 page(s...|$|R
