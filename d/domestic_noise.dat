40|$|Background: Air traffic has {{increased}} {{for the past}} decades and is forecasted to continue to grow. Noise due to current airport operations can impair the physical and psychological well-being of airport residents. Objectives: The field study investigated aircraft noise-induced short-term (i. e., within hourly intervals) annoyance in local residents near a busy airport. We aimed at examining the contribution of acoustical and non-acoustical factors to the annoyance rating. Methods: Across four days from getting up till going to bed, 55 residents near Cologne/Bonn Airport (M = 46 years, SD = 14 years, 34 female) rated their annoyance due to aircraft noise at hourly intervals. For each participant and each hour, 26 noise metrics from outdoor measurements and further 6 individualized metrics that took into account the sound attenuation due to each person’s whereabouts in and around their homes were obtained. Non-acoustical variables were differentiated into situational factors (time of day, performed activity during past hour, day of the week) and personal factors (e. g., sensitivity to noise, attitudes, <b>domestic</b> <b>noise</b> insulation). Generalized Estimation Equations were applied {{for the development of}} a prediction model for annoyance. Results: Acoustical factors explained only a small proportion (13. 7...|$|E

40|$|Background and Objectives: Sound of {{motorcycles}} {{plays an}} important role in noise pollution in big cities. This is due to the lack of national law or standards to control the <b>noise</b> of <b>domestic</b> and also imported motorcycles. This study tries to introduce a practical limit value in different stage of motorcycle life cycle by assessing their noise pollution. Materials and Methods: First the motorcycles noise standards at different countries were studied and they were compared with the results from noise level of 622 motorcycles in 3 different groups. The sample volume in each group corresponds to the amount of their annual production rate. Then using statistical tests, a limit was determined in which 90 % of the domestic motorcycles can be covered. The limit is proposed as the standard for <b>domestic</b> motorcycle <b>noise.</b> Results: The limit for motorcycles of groups 1, 2 and 3 were 84, 86 and 87 dB (A),respectively in the TA stage. For the COP stage (Conformity of Production), the limit increases according to certain formula. In the end, a flowchart was proposed as a standard method for measuring the sound of motorcycles in the TA and COP stages was proposed. Conclusion: Noise level of the domestic motorcycles is at least 9 dB (A) higher than the noise limit value of European motorcycle. If European limit value is considered for producing the national motorcycle, 90 % of them will get out of production cycle and this would not be practical...|$|R
40|$|In {{light of}} the plethora of {{guidance}} documents available {{for a wide range}} of noise sources and activities, the absence of a document specific to dog barking is unfortunate, and a glaring omission in the noise guidance library. In the absence of any existing guidance documents, approaches adopted by Noise Consultants and Local Authority EHOs in the British Isles are highly variable, and no emerging trends are readily apparent, apart from widespread misapplication of BS 4142 : 1997 when assessing impacts. Although the 2014 version of the standard specifically precludes application to <b>domestic</b> animal <b>noise,</b> several interviewed Consultants indicate that they intend to apply same due to the absence of any other guidance. All Consultants interviewed acknowledged the need for a kennel noise guidance document which will allow a consistent approach to be adopted by Consultants and planning authorities alike. Such a document might include guidance on measurement methodology, predictive modelling, noise limits, and advice on kennel design and noise management, and would benefit Planning Departments, Environmental Health personnel, kennel operators and Noise Consultants. It is considered that the derivation of suitable noise limits would require some element of social annoyance studies relating to barking noise, in order to identify (a) a suitable noise descriptor and (b) thresholds of annoyance. A barking noise guidance document may benefit from inclusion of an assessment methodology based on a specified number of barks to be measured, similar to the method set out in the CIEH clay target shooting guidance document...|$|R
40|$|The {{noise from}} {{personal}} computers is generally characterized by their fan noises.

The second test determined the limen of perception for a tone ramping in frequency and level as a fan increases its speed. Surprisingly, the results indicate that, in the tested octave, reduced ramp rates decreased the threshold of perception. The experiments further show the limen of perception of the tones to be the same for slowly ramped and stationary tones, and response times seem relatively shorter for lower ramp rates...|$|R
50|$|Tolerance Rings are {{radially}} sprung rings {{that are}} press fitted between two mating components {{to act as}} frictional fasteners. They are flexible shims designed to fix two cylindrical parts together. The wavelike protrusions that run around the circumference of the ring generate a retention force to provide an optimal fit between the two mating components {{without the need for}} adhesive or excessive assembly force, simplifying the process for manufacturers. They allow for any misalignment caused by thermal expansion or excessive vibration. Tolerance rings can be used as bearing mounts and as a means of dealing with torque transfer, torque overload protection and axial slip between mating components. They are often used to isolate undesirable vibration in engines and electric motors, for noise-free mechanism operation in passenger vehicles and <b>domestic</b> appliances, where <b>noise</b> reduction has become a major trend in recent years.

40|$|I survey Cobbing’s {{considerable}} {{and varied}} output, placing it initially into approximate chronological phases. I discern formal and aesthetic traits and their development over time. I attempt {{to place the}} work within wider poetic and artistic traditions, namely avant-gardism, the British Poetry Revival, sound and visual poetry, and the exploration of artistic form. I propose an understanding of flow as an intersection of two axes: linear temporality (flow time) which exists outside of social time, and multidimensional or constellatory spatiality which is generated by certain artistic works. The body bridges social time and flow time through creative gestures and by unifying temporal elements. I trace the features of abstraction as they emerged throughout roughly {{the first half of}} the twentieth century in visual art, sound poetry and lexical poetry. I define poetic and artistic form, noting that radical works explore traditional boundaries of space, and discusses the politics of form.

However, little is known about the aetiology of this problem. This study aimed to progress on understanding of the causes of canine noise fear problems, which might contribute to future treatment research. In this thesis, a web-based survey was employed to investigate the aetiology of canine noise fear. First, in the study of risk-factors within the world population (N= 3516), the presence of other dogs in the house, age of the dog, source, breed, country of residence and sex of the dog were found to be demographic risk factors. Significant risk factors regarding development were a previous traumatic experience associated with loud noises and a lack of exposure to engines. Most of these risk factors were also found in the UK and USA subpopulations, suggesting the risk factors above appear to be general regardless of country.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to examine the {{existence}} of an association between child blood pressure (BP) and exposure to <b>domestic</b> jet aircraft <b>noise</b> in the context of the construction of a new parallel north-south runway at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. The baseline study was commissioned and funded by the Federal Airports Corporation (FAC), with measurements conducted in 1994 and 1995. A follow-up longitudinal component to the study was subsequently commissioned and funded by the FAC in 1997, and measurements conducted in the same year. As the same individuals were measured and re-measured over changing conditions of exposure to aircraft noise, the quasiexperimental nature of the study allowed inferences to be made regarding exposure to aircraft noise and child BP. The main hypotheses for testing were that BP, and within-subject longitudinal changes in BP, are positively related to <b>domestic</b> jet aircraft <b>noise</b> exposure and longitudinal changes in <b>domestic</b> jet aircraft <b>noise</b> exposure respectively. Subsidiary hypotheses tested for evidence of short- and long-term BP adaptation effects where BPs were related to prior changes to aircraft noise exposures. A sample of 75 primary schools within a 20 km radius of Sydney Airport under various noise exposure conditions, both existing and those projected with the advent of the new runway, participated in the study. The baseline cohort comprised 1, 230 Year 3 / 4 children attending the schools in 1994 and 1995, and the follow-up participants comprised 628 of the original baseline sample re-measured in 1997. Study participants were enrolled by active parental consent. The baseline response rate was approximately 40 % of children in the participating schools. Systolic (SBP) and diastolic (DBP) blood pressure readings of the children were taken using automated BP measuring equipment along with anthropometric measurements (heights, weights, skinfold thicknesses and waist measurements). Parental surveys captured items pertaining to the child�s ethnic background as measured by the country of birth of the child and parent(s), residential address and housing structure, child eating habits and activity levels, along with family and child history of high blood pressure. Aircraft noise exposure data were collected by the National Acoustic Laboratories and processed into the energy-averaged noise metric used in Australia for aircraft noise exposure assessment called the Australian Noise Exposure Index (ANEI). Mean exposures for a given calendar month were used in the analysis. ANEI values were geocoded to exact geographic locations using digitised street maps from which values for each house and school address, also geocoded, were interpolated. A child BP measured in a given month was matched to a aircraft noise exposure value both at their school and residential address for that month for analysis. After adjusting for confounding and other factors, the cross-sectional relationship between BP and aircraft noise exposure was found to be inconsistent. SBP was nonsignificantly negatively associated with school aircraft noise exposure at baseline (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, cluster-sampling-adjusted p> 0. 05), but positively and non-significantly associated with school aircraft noise exposure at follow-up (0. 05 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). As for SBP, baseline DBP was significantly negatively related to school aircraft noise exposure at (0. 09 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). Within-subject BP changes, occurring from baseline to follow-up, regressed on corresponding longitudinal changes in aircraft noise exposures produced inconsistent results. SBP change was positively and non-significantly (0. 027 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05) associated with corresponding school aircraft noise exposure change, while SBP change was negatively associated total aircraft noise exposure change (statistically nonsignificant, 0. 06 mmHg/ANEI, p> 0. 05). DBP changes were similarly and nonsignificantly related to corresponding aircraft noise exposure changes. Some evidence for short-term BP adaptation to recent changes in aircraft noise exposure was found. Consistent negative associations between systolic and diastolic BP and recent changes in school aircraft noise exposure were found. This association was statistically significant at study baseline (SBP: 0. 19 mmHg/ANEI, p 0. 05). In the presence of inconsistent cross-sectional BP-aircraft noise exposure associations, this finding is consistent with evidence of a homoeostatic BP response to recent changes in aircraft noise exposure, where resting BP returns to pre-existing levels unrelated to aircraft noise exposure. The public health implication of this finding appears to be benign...|$|R
40|$|It is {{commonly}} held in <b>domestic</b> lawn mower <b>noise</b> control literature that under-deck noise sources {{are a major}} contributor to the total machine noise. Although disparity exists among authors a resounding theme is that these noise sources are due solely to blade motion. In this thesis I develop a concise argument for the importance of reducing this source, investigate previous efforts for redressing the problem, and develop quantitative experimental procedures and numerical investigations. These analyses identify the influence blade and machine geometries play in noise control for a particular machine and somewhat isolate noise sources and their relative dominant frequencies. The results show structural vibration is a dominant source at low frequencies and possess resonance at 50 Hz intervals through to 500 Hz. Higher frequencies (> 500 Hz) are attributable to the aerodynamic noise of the blades and do not possess any dominant frequencies to be redressed. Raised blade wings are monotonically noisier with increasing wing angle. Modification to the blade tip and trailing edge produce a 2. 6 dB(A) reduction in noise from the standard blade by reducing tip vortices, validated by CFX analyses, with little reduction to the machines catching function. While this reduction is encouraging the benefits are lost when the machine is used for cutting. To cut grass produces a sound pressure level at least 8 dB(A) higher than the machine noise at idle. The key implication being the strongest noise level produced arises from cutting, eroding the value of mitigating blade induced noise. Moreover, being an electric machine to reduce noise at idle it can be turned off. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{totality of}} all {{environmental}} influences, including <b>domestic</b> and industrial <b>noise,</b> {{must be taken}} into account in the design of building structures. Building envelopes that have appropriate acoustic protection properties are to be used in the practice of the acoustic protection (soundproofing, etc.). According to the principles of structural design, design of soundproof buildings can be broken down into the two groups: design with account for the security conditions (eg., windows, doors, walls, floors), and design of noise-proof structures (eg., partitions, suspended ceilings). Multi-optional design of building structures or buildings that meet the terms of acoustic protection requires a modern approach to the process of their development. Any progress in this area is associated with computer-aided design supported by multiple analysis options. Automation allows adjustments in order to comply with the variety of the input data or objective functions to provide for optimal cycling options. In this regard, the authors describe the algorithms and principles of design of building envelopes on the condition of and subject to the acoustic protection. The proposed solution represents a software package capable of performing a multivariate analysis of options of acoustic protection at each stage of building design. Practical application of the software package used to solve practical problems in the design of building envelopes has demonstrated its higher efficiency that the one of traditional design methods.
