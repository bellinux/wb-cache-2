40|$|The {{imperial}} {{policy of}} Russia in the 18 th and early 19 th centuries {{led to the}} formation of various diasporas, with the largest being of Polish, Jewish, German and Finnish origin. They were the focus of attention of the tsarist administration while their status was regulated by a variety of laws. Specific features that distinguished social, political and economic development of the Russian Empire were behind the fact that different regions became home to emerging ethnic communities. Jews, Germans, Poles, Finns, Latvians, and Estonians moved to the outskirts of the state both by forced and voluntarily. Laws of the Russian Empire specified places they could reside in and types of economic activities they could undertake. This article is aimed at defining the formation features pertaining <b>European</b> <b>diasporas</b> in Russia in the late 18 th and early 19 th century on the national and regional scale. To this end we need to determine the nature of the emergence of the ethnic communities in the Russian macro-regions (such as Siberia), reveal specificity of the Russian legislation regarding Jews, Germans and Poles in historic different periods of the Russian Empire and give a quantitative characterization of the communities. Accomplishing this will make it possible to describe the way the <b>European</b> <b>diasporas</b> formed and developed in Russia over the 18 th and 19 th centuries. Our approach to these objectives is based on the assumption that Russia throughout the 18 th and early 20 th century was a classical empire with the diasporas being actors in the national and regional policies rather than existing in isolation. This will help determine the stages and nature of the diasporas ' formation and their place in the economic, social and cultural life o...|$|E
40|$|In April 2014 {{government}} forces defeated a rebel offensive {{in the north}} of the Syrian province of Latakia. Although they initially reached the coast, the insurgents were unable to hold their positions there. The rebel forces included many Chechens and other Caucasians, had who previously been seen fighting exclusively in the Caucasus. Their strong presence in Syria is a completely new turn in international jihadism, and a warning to be taken seriously, as many arrive from the Georgian, Turkish and <b>European</b> <b>diasporas</b> rather from their original home republics. While their goal remains to "liberate" the Caucasus from Russian rule, they are now struggling to topple the regime of Bashar al-Assad in Syria and there is a risk that they will continue terrorist activity after returning to Turkey and Europe. The arrival of the Chechens in Syria makes a joint anti-terrorism strategy with Turkey even more urgent, and forces Western states to cooperate with Russian security agencies.

40|$|The article {{offers an}} {{alternative}} stance to established research emphasising {{the absence of}} a European public sphere and the presence of Euroscepticism both in the media and public opinion at large. Whereas these are recognised and proven phenomena, the article argues that a perpetual, albeit evolving, cosmopolitan European identity is being reproduced as part of the natural process of globalisation. Europeanness finds some of its fresh strength in phenomena such as work migration. Although migration for work {{is by no means a}} new occurrence, Eastern <b>European</b> work <b>diasporas</b> participate in the construction of a renewed idea of Europe through new networks of communication supported by new media technologies which, although not mainstream, appear to gather strength and will become indispensable to the way new spaces of European identity are articulated...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{explores the}} making of race {{and the politics of}} belonging in Costa Rica between 1921 and 1950, during a period of shifting racial borders and entangled terrains of power. While the idea of "racial democracy" and official discourses of mestizaje (racial mixing) predominate in Latin America, Costa Rica has been long held as a unique country in Central America with an exceptional social geography characterized by "whiteness" and homogeneity. Employed in the United Fruit Company enclave in the Atlantic region of Limón since the late nineteenth century but not formally granted citizenship until 1949, persons of British West Indian origin posed alternative claims to racial belonging, based heavily on the language and ideas of Garveyism [...] the Pan-African political philosophy of Marcus Garvey and his Universal Negro Improvement Association (UNIA). The surge of anti-imperial protest against the United Fruit Company in the 1920 s and the subsequent renegotiation of the Company's contract in 1934 transferred the centers of banana production from the Atlantic to the Pacific coast, where "persons of color" were prohibited from employment. This process re-drew the borders of the nation and initiated the "Costa Ricanization" of Limón. Theorizing Limón as a borderland formed by the encounters of U. S., Central American, and Caribbean ideas of race, this dissertation maps the convergences and divergences of two distinct yet interwoven articulations of racial citizenship in Costa Rica; one West Indian, Garveyite, and black, and the other criollo-identified and white. Utilizing interdisciplinary research methods and critical theories of race and diaspora, this project employs an analytical lens that engages the national and transnational politics of race, and the relationship between space, power, discourse, and visual culture in the making and contestation of racial belonging. This dissertation draws from the fields of African Diaspora Studies, Latin American Studies, Intellectual History, Cultural Geography, Women's Studies, and Media Studies to analyze the languages, logics, signifiers, and imageries of racial belonging, reading newspapers and petitions as "counterarchives" and key sites where Costa Ricans and West Indians forged cultures of redemption and contours of citizenship, putting them on the record. Introducing the concept of "redemptive geographies," the discursive spaces and territorial claims in which Costa Ricans and West Indians negotiated modern subjectivity and "diasporic" identity, this dissertation examines the re-mapping of the <b>European</b> and African <b>diasporas</b> alongside articulations of belonging to the Costa Rican nation. Costa Ricans re-formulated criollo whiteness and re-inscribed a mythology of homogeneity based on an identification with the Spanish settlers of the colonial past. The idea of national whiteness reinforced the outsider status of West Indians and was also an anti-imperial critique of the power of United Fruit in the country, which effectively reduced them to the status of colonized non-whites. Plagued with the problems of placelessness, lack of citizenship, and misrepresentation as savage threats to the Costa Rican nation, West Indians "invented" Africa in particular ways, highlighting legacies of greatness and civilization through the poetics and imageries of Garveyism to articulate black modernity and Afro-Costa Rican identity. A key function of the dissertation is to highlight the internal hierarchies and exclusions that underpin {{the making of}} these redemptive geographies, complicating the notion of looking at history from below. I examine the ways Costa Rican and Garveyite ideologies of racial belonging invoked ideas and discourses of respectability, upstanding morality, and honorable behavior that drew interior borders along the lines of class, culture, gender, and sexuality. Defining and representing female honor was critical to producing and reproducing the authentic national body. I not only investigate the imageries of womanhood, motherhood, and femininity [...] including the frequent photographs of women featured in the newspapers [...] but I also analyze the ways that women theorized their own place within the projects of redemption...|$|R
