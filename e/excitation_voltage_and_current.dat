40|$|The time-domain {{technique}} for impedance spectroscopy consists of computing the <b>excitation</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> response Fourier images by fast or discrete Fourier transformation and calculating their relation. Here we propose an alternative method for <b>excitation</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> response processing for deriving a system impedance spectrum {{based on a}} fast and flexible adaptive filtering method. We show the equivalence between the problem of adaptive filter learning and deriving the system impedance spectrum. To be specific, we express the impedance via the adaptive filter weight coefficients. The noise-canceling property of adaptive filtering is also justified. Using the RLC circuit as a model system, we experimentally show that adaptive filtering yields correct admittance spectra and elements ratings in the high-noise conditions when the Fourier-transform technique fails. Providing the additional sensitivity of impedance spectroscopy, adaptive filtering {{can be applied to}} otherwise impossible-to-interpret time-domain impedance data. The advantages of adaptive filtering are justified with practical living-cell impedance measurements. Comment: 5 figures, 10 equations, 1 table.

40|$|Ultrasonic turning {{has time}} variant {{parameters}} due to temperature effects and changing load conditions during the process. This {{results in a}} change of the resonance frequency and vibration amplitude. To realize constant vibration amplitudes {{it is necessary to}} control the ultrasonic transducer by a suitable feedback controller. One approach to drive such a system is to use the resonance frequency as operating point in connection with an amplitude feedback controller. The advantages of resonant driven low damped systems are low voltages and high values of effective power. This paper presents a digital system used for parameter identification and model-based feedback control of the ultrasonic turning tool. During the turning process the system load depends on several factors like chip formation, material inhomogeneity, warming and tool wear. To achieve a stable process and a uniform surface of the work piece the feedback controller has to guarantee constant vibration amplitudes of the ultrasonic tool. The controller used in this paper consists of a digital resonance controller and a current amplitude controller with a frequency of 500 Hz. The current amplitude and phase between the <b>excitation</b> <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> are determined by phase sensitive demodulation (PSD).

30|$|One of {{the major}} {{bottlenecks}} of fast development in the modern electronics industry is heat. Managing the high heat flux generated by billions of transistors in an integrated circuit (IC) is the main challenge. A scalable, built-in, and agile temperature sensor which can provide real-time thermal history of an IC chip is essential to thermal failure analysis [1]. However, thermal measurement at microscale and nanoscale is a technical challenge. When both high spatial resolution and high temperature sensitivity are required, only a few approaches, such as scanning thermal microscopy [2], luminescent nanoparticles, and infrared thermography [3 – 5], remain {{in the list of}} suitable candidates. If built-in thermal sensors are required for time-resolvable solutions in a solid device, such as in IC chips, micro-electro-mechanical system, a lab-on-a-chip, or a flexible printed circuits, then it seems that only stripe-shaped resistive sensor [6] and thin-film thermocouple (TFTC) are left in the candidate list. The passive nature of a thermocouple makes it superior to a resistive thermal sensor (usually made of metal or semiconductors) because a thermocouple provides a far more rapid response, does not require external <b>excitation</b> <b>voltage</b> or <b>current,</b> <b>and</b> generates no additional heat which may cause unexpected electrical noise and error in temperature measurement.|$|R

The three-phase induction machine connected to the network, {{to work as a}} generator for wind farms, is excited on the rotor circuit by a slip-frequency current injected to the rotor, from an exciter mounted on the same shaft of the machine. The resulting rotating magnetic field rotates at synchronous speed; as such the generated power has a constant frequency independent of the shaft speed.

40|$|Graduation date: 1967 The {{utilization}} of extra-high-voltage underground power cables over distances greater than 100 miles presents serious problems {{relative to the}} <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> limits of such cables. These problems are directly associated with the fixed amount of capacitance inherent in long cable lines. As a result, large charging currents are characteristic with long cable line operation when energized under steady-state conditions. A possible means of handling this problem is realized {{in the use of}} shunt inductive reactors as charging-current compensating elements. These reactors have a definite effect on the <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> magnitudes depending upon the mode of compensation. Without compensation, maximum <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> magnitudes well exceed the cable limits of <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current.</b> With compensation, these maximum amplitudes are reduced in magnitude depending upon the number and degree of compensating units.

It gives the time domain {{solution of the}} terminal <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> {{as well as their}} line distributions.

As the <b>voltage</b> <b>and</b> <b>current</b> distributions get more complicated with time, a new piecewise exponential with controllable accuracy is invented. A segmentation algorithm is also devised so that the line is dynamically bisected to guarantee that the total piecewise exponential error is {{a small fraction of the}} local truncation error.
