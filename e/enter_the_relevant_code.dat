One claims, the quality of the public claims not cause any, may be excluded from the scope of Law No. 6183. All the claims of public administration are not public claims.

This raised the question to know if other even unimodular lattices in dimension 24 could be constructed in that way. There are 23 such lattices as per Niemeier's classification [14].
