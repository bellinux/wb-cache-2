The Aboriginal Memorial decorations reflect traditional clan designs and significant dreamings for which the artists had responsibility.|$|E
5|$|The Fool's Gold Loaf {{begins with}} a loaf of French white bread that is covered in two tablespoons of {{margarine}} and baked in the oven at 350F/180C until brown. One pound of sliced bacon is fried in oil until crispy and drained. The loaf is sliced lengthwise, <b>hollowed</b> <b>out,</b> and filled with peanut butter, grape jelly and bacon.|$|E
5|$|Hugo Weaving, who {{portrayed the}} Red Skull, wore a latex mask {{conceived}} by prosthetic makeup designer David White. The visual effects team had to manipulate his face considerably, as the mask was bulky {{and they wanted}} {{to make it look like}} tight skin wrapped around a very bony structure. They thinned out Weaving's cheeks and lower lip, <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> his eyes, and removed his eyelashes and nose to make him appear more like the Red Skull character.|$|E

5|$|Local traditions include Lantern Night, {{which was}} held on 16 September and {{involved}} children in the town with candle lanterns made from <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> root vegetables such as Mangelwurzel or swede. It was the last remaining reminder of the Watchet Fair (also known as St Decuman's Fair). Another tradition is Queen Caturn's Day on the last Saturday of November. Watchet was famous for its blue dye and Queen Caturn was so impressed she bestowed the town's folk with cider and cakes {{as a reward for}} this. The tradition is carried on with costumes and celebrations.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{treecreeper}} breeds {{from the}} age of one year, nesting in tree crevices or behind bark flakes. Where present, the introduced North American giant sequoia is a favourite nesting tree, since a nest cavity can be easily <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> in its soft bark. Crevices in buildings or walls are sometimes used, and artificial nest boxes or flaps may be preferred in coniferous woodland. The nest has a base of twigs, pine needles, grass or bark, and a lining of finer material such as feathers, wool, moss, lichen or spider web.|$|E
5|$|The nest of the dusky woodswallow {{consists}} of twigs, roots {{and other similar}} foliage matted {{together to form a}} bowl shape, which is lined with grass. It is positioned safely, behind bark, and/or high in a tree branch, and sometimes in a <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> tree stump. The nest is made during the period from August to January, {{and with the help of}} several birds. The mated pair will then guard the nest, while others will help them take care of the babies. The female lays white eggs, of which there are usually no more than three or four. While the incubation period lasts for sixteen days, the amount of time taken for fledgling can be this long to around twenty days.|$|E

5|$|The Antankarana were {{historically}} {{fishermen and}} pastoralist zebu herders, although {{in recent years}} most have become agriculturalists. Sea fishing is carried out in two-man canoes made from a single <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> log. Antankarana fishermen used these canoes to hunt whales, turtles and fish. They also used nets to hunt in rivers, where they could catch eels, fish, crayfish and other food sources. Salt production was historically a major economic activity. Historically the Antankarana engaged in trading with European seafarers, exchanging tortoiseshell for guns. Today, {{while the majority of}} Antankarana continue to work in these traditional sectors – especially the highly lucrative shrimp fishing business or the growing of sugarcane – many are wage laborers. More highly educated community members, particularly among the noble class, work in salaried positions as government officials, teachers {{and a variety of other}} trades and professions. The SIRAMA national sugar company factories are located in Antankarana territory and employ many migrants, but relatively few Antankarana as their standard of living on average is high enough to be able to pursue better opportunities.|$|E
5|$|The {{skull of}} Megalosaurus is poorly known. The {{discovered}} skull elements are generally rather large {{in relation to}} the rest of the material. This can either be coincidental or indicate that Megalosaurus had an uncommonly large head. The praemaxilla is not known, making it impossible to determine whether the snout profile was curved or rectangular. A rather stubby snout is suggested by the fact that the front branch of the maxilla was short. In the depression around the antorbital fenestra to the front, a smaller non-piercing hollowing can be seen that is probably homologous to the fenestra maxillaris. The maxilla bears thirteen teeth. The teeth are relatively large, with a crown length up to seven centimetres. The teeth are supported from behind by tall, triangular, unfused interdental plates. The cutting edges bear eighteen to twenty denticula per centimetre. The tooth formula is probably 4, 13–14/13–14. The jugal bone is pneumatised, pierced by a large foramen from the direction of the antorbital fenestra. It was probably <b>hollowed</b> <b>out</b> by an outgrowth of an air sac in the nasal bone. Such a level of pneumatisation of the jugal is not known from other megalosaurids and might represent a separate autapomorphy.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{investigations}} of influence parameters of electrodischarge machining (EDM) on the shape accuracy of holes machined by EDM process. BP- 95. machine with electronic generator type was used to perform EDM process. Kerosene {{was used as a}} dielectric. During EDM process the parameters of current were permanent. The shape of electrode and way of passing dielectric were changed. The following parameters were determined: productivity of EDM process and shape accuracy of the drilling holes. The accuracy of bored cylindrical holes, is highest in case of <b>hollowing</b> <b>out</b> with the tubular electrode and for sucking out working liquid by her inner life. In the case of <b>hollowing</b> <b>out</b> with the electrode tubular, sinking the tube with pumping liquid by the inner life is the most favourable method causing the smallest mistakes of outlines of the cylindrically shape. The time of boring the arterial hole is shortest in case of <b>hollowing</b> <b>out</b> with the electrode tubular and for pumping working liquid by inside. 1...|$|R
