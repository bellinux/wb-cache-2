5000|$|Other {{types of}} {{materials}} {{are also used}} in constructing jig bodies, such as a Chenille wrap on the <b>hook</b> <b>shaft,</b> various feather hackle, hairs or other fur, marabou, Flashabou, and other materials. Construction is often similar {{to the process of}} Fly tying. Some jigs are constructed identically to their artificial fly counterparts, one example a [...] "Wooly Bugger" [...] fly but tied on a jig head.|$|E
50|$|The knotless {{is usually}} {{tied to a}} leader, rather than {{directly}} to the main line. The {{far end of the}} leader may already be baited or looped in preparation for bait, because the knot will be tied using the near end as the working end. The working end is passed through the hook eye from back to front (towards the hook point), wrapped tightly around itself and the <b>hook</b> <b>shaft</b> several times (down from the eye towards the bend of the hook), and finally passed once more through the eye back to front.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "Spindle of Necessity", {{according}} to Plato, is [...] "shaped [...] [...] [...] {{like the ones}} we know"—the standard Greek spindle, consisting of a <b>hook,</b> <b>shaft,</b> and whorl. The hook was fixed {{near the top of}} the shaft on its long side. On the other end resided the whorl. The hook was used to spin the shaft, which in turn spun the whorl on the other end. Placed on the whorl of his celestial spindle were 8 [...] "orbits", whereof each created a perfect circle. Each [...] "orbit" [...] is given different descriptions by Plato.|$|E
50|$|Certain {{designs of}} harness saddle have a groove in the top, into which fits a chain that is <b>hooked</b> to the <b>shafts.</b> The belly band also <b>hooks</b> onto the <b>shafts</b> from beneath.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{a most unusual}} problem of a split needle following a lung radiofrequency ablation (RFA) procedure. We encountered the problem when retracting the electrode <b>hooks</b> into the <b>shaft</b> at completion of the ablation. We describe the process we adopted to overcome this problem. Charring of the ablated tissue can cause the tissue to become caught {{in the space between}} the <b>hooks</b> and the <b>shaft</b> or stick to the hooks. This can prevent withdrawal of the <b>hooks</b> into the <b>shaft</b> and is therefore an important complication of which practitioners need to be aware...|$|R
30|$|The {{surface is}} typical of a fibrous {{composite}} break in bending. All hooks fractured at {{the region of the}} join between <b>hook</b> and <b>shaft</b> which is the region of the entire <b>hook</b> structure (both <b>shaft</b> and arced tip) that experiences the largest stress when the hook is placed in tension, noting that the bract itself is secured by glue. At no single instance did any of the test hooks fail at the bract.|$|R
25|$|The {{crochet hook}} comes in many sizes and materials, such as bone, bamboo, aluminium, plastic, and steel. Because sizing is {{categorized}} by {{the diameter of}} the <b>hook's</b> <b>shaft,</b> a crafter aims to create stitches of a certain size in order to reach a particular gauge specified in a given pattern. If gauge is not reached with one hook, another is used until the stitches made are the needed size. Crafters may have a preference for one type of hook material over another due to aesthetic appeal, yarn glide, or hand disorders such as arthritis, where bamboo or wood hooks are favored over metal for the perceived warmth and flexibility during use. Hook grips and ergonomic hook handles are also available to assist crafters.|$|R
50|$|Shastoceras resembles Uhligia {{from the}} Lower Barremian of Germany, except for being stouter. In both genera the initial portion {{is short and}} in general straight, {{followed}} by {{a more or less}} 180 deg. bend and a straight to moderately curved shaft ending in a <b>hook.</b> The <b>shaft</b> of Shastoceras is shorter and broader than that of Uhligia.|$|R
40|$|Lightweight {{connector}} automatically aligns beams to be jointed, and withstands torsion, tension, and compression loads. One beam has connector, {{other has}} receptor. Bracket aligns connector and receptor. When actuated, spring in connector pushes <b>shaft</b> into receptor. <b>Hooks</b> on <b>shaft</b> snap to lock into receptor slots. Union can be separated easily without damage. Connectors {{are designed for}} in-space assembly, but may be suited to ground assemblies as well...|$|R

5000|$|Shaft tugs, or just tugs. Loops {{attached}} to the back band {{to hold up the}} shafts of a vehicle in van or fine harness (not needed in cart harness, which attaches to <b>hooks</b> on the <b>shafts).</b> Two types: ...|$|R
30|$|The <b>hook</b> and <b>shaft</b> {{are drawn}} in proportion, {{and it was}} {{observed}} {{at this point that}} given Nature’s reputation for energy efficiency and balance, the shaft walls are near parallel, making it clear that they are hiding some secret with regards their form. And that is the inner form, the non-homogenous fibrous, cellular flesh of the <b>hook</b> and <b>shaft</b> and their inner control system or genetic instructions that led the flower, mauve and bright and well suited to the pollinators of the area to transform into the perfect seed dispersal mechanism using the same structures, though desiccated. The flattened flange is optional, but follows from {{the fact that there are}} further structural options available, such as flanges or setae, substructures that could play a part in anchoring more firmly in the substrate or providing a brake for adhesion and detachment, mimicking the attachment mechanism of the dragonfly head arrestor mechanism [4]. At this stage a universal foot is being considered for a one-size-fits-all attachment mechanism that can anchor to a wall or vertical flat surface irrespective of the size of the object, and then, it shall be scaled down according to need and ability to adhere and detach repeatedly.|$|R
5000|$|Back band. A strap {{going through}} the harness saddle to join the belly band either side. Takes {{the weight of the}} shafts or pole. In cart harness it is {{replaced}} by a chain running in a groove in the harness saddle, <b>hooked</b> to the <b>shafts</b> either side.|$|R
30|$|As part 3 of {{this series}} of three papers this culminates from the {{consideration}} {{of the results of}} research into five species of long <b>shaft</b> <b>hook</b> including the A. minus species, various microscopy techniques including confocal microscopy and the design of a bioinspired model for hooked structures of the order of 200 microns span, and two further attachment mechanisms of similar size, of insect chitin.|$|R
50|$|An {{adult male}} {{specimen}} of Calinda muiscas {{has been described}} having a brownish-ochre head and thorax. The antennae are dark-brown and ochreous, legs, abdomen and genitalia are ochreous. The forewing is yellowish-transparent with ochreous veins. The louse as apical dilatation of aedeagus, elongate with distinct ventro-basal <b>hook</b> distant from <b>shaft.</b> The forewing is about 2 mm long. The host plant for the jumping plant louse is unknown.|$|R
40|$|Panagrellus ceylonensis n. sp. is {{described}} from rubber latex in Ceylon. Its long, slender spicules are curved ventrally with a dorsal deflection at two-thirds of their length. The manubrium is thick and <b>hooked,</b> and the <b>shaft</b> is not widened at the shoulder. The terminal bifurcations are wide, with the dorsal one considerably longer and thicker than the ventral. The main ventral element is continuous with the terminal sheath with the ventral bifurcation arising within it...|$|R
50|$|Garudan Thookkam (Eagle Hanging) is {{a ritual}} art form {{performed}} in Kali temples of south Kerala, south India. The people who dress up as Garuda perform the dance. After the dance performance, the hang-designate dangle from a <b>shaft</b> <b>hooking</b> {{the skin on}} his back. In some places, the ritual is performed colorfully with Garudas taken in a procession on bullock carts or boats or hand pulled carts. It {{will be available in}} Devi temple during the festival of Meena bharani and Pathamudayam in Thiruvanchoor in Kottayam district.|$|R
5000|$|Breeching [...] A strap {{around the}} horse's {{haunches}} {{allowing it to}} set back and slow a vehicle, usually <b>hooked</b> to the <b>shafts</b> or pole of the vehicle. Used for a single horse, a pair, or in a larger team, only for the wheelers (the animal or pair closest to the vehicle). The leaders in a team do not have breeching, {{as they are in}} front of the shafts or pole and so cannot slow the vehicle. Breeching may also be omitted in fine harness, or when the cart is very light or has efficient brakes on the wheels.|$|R
50|$|The head is {{not well}} {{preserved}} in known specimens. It comprised approximately 20% of the body length (excluding the arms). Brain cartilage is observed in some specimens, {{as well as a}} pair of aragonitic statoliths which helped the animal determine horizontal orientation when swimming. Belemnotheutis, like most of the other belemnoids, had ten arms of equal length lined with two rows of inward-pointing hooks each. Each of the hooks were composed of several sections. The curved pointed tip is called the uncinus and was probably {{the only part of the}} hooks exposed. The rest of the <b>hook</b> (the <b>shaft</b> and the base) were embedded in a sheath of soft tissue below the orbicular scar, a small groove where the tissue attachment terminated. They are also believed to have been stalked and mobile, helping the animal manipulate its prey. Traces of functional suckers have been found and these constitute a single row on each arm, alternating in between the pairs of hooks. The size of the suckers decreases distally along the arms, with the largest (around 2 mm in diameter) being closest to the head. The length of the arms varies with the size of the individual but may have reached 100 mm in larger specimens.|$|R
500|$|... {{was made}} {{in the image of the}} round heavens and on it were shown the lunar mansions in their order, the equator and the degrees of the heavenly circumference. Water, flowing into scoops, turned a wheel automatically, {{rotating}} it one complete revolution in one day and night. Besides this, there were two rings fitted around the celestial sphere outside, having the sun and moon threaded on them, and these were made to move in circling orbit... And they made a wooden casing the surface of which represented the horizon, since the instrument was half sunk in it. It permitted the exact determinations of the time of dawns and dusks, full and new moons, tarrying and hurrying. Moreover, there were two wooden jacks standing on the horizon surface, having one a bell and the other a drum in front of it, the bell being struck automatically to indicate the hours, and the drum being beaten automatically to indicate the quarters. All these motions were brought about by machinery within the casing, each depending on wheels and <b>shafts,</b> <b>hooks,</b> pins and interlocking rods, stopping devices and locks checking mutually.|$|R
