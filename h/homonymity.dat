In al-Tabari, he is exalted by the people, is appointed commander of the archers and lives out his life in great honor. The distance the arrow travels varies: in one it is thousand leagues (farsakhs), in another forty days walk. In several, the arrow traveled from dawn to noon, in others from dawn until sunset. A few sources specify a particular date for the event. The Middle Persian Mah i Frawardin notes the 6th day of the 1st month (i.e. Khordad of Frawardin); later sources associate the event with the name-day festivities of Tiregan (13th of Tir) [...] "presumably" [...] provoked by the <b>homonymity</b> with the Yazata Tir or tir [...] "arrow."

40|$|The {{subject of}} this bachelor's thesis is verbal Czech/Serbian <b>homonymity.</b> The thesis focuses on verbal prefixes {{and their ability to}} change verb meaning in {{connection}} to interlanguage <b>homonymity.</b> The first part provides readers with a theoretical background needed for understanding this topic, namely lexicology and its domains. Further, emphasis is put on <b>homonymity</b> (and its genesis), polysemy and word formation. My research focuses particularly on prefixes in both languages and the comparison between their individual meanings. The same method is applied to the comparing of verbs that are prefixed by given prefixes. The meanings are entered into the Czech/Serbian dictionary which contains 101 homonym pairs and three homonym triplets...|$|E

Thus, it is desirable for a given system to identify, among all the couples (c; d) which are Sense of Direction, those who have additional properties. In fact, by using such properties, the solution of problems in a system could be further improved without any modification in the labeling. We first consider two such properties: a strong form of decoding consistency called everywhere consistency, and the coding property called everywhere associativity. We prove that for any system with Sense of Direction there always exists {{at least a couple}} (c; d) where c is everywhere associative and d is everywhere consistent. The proof is constructive. We then focus on systems with edge symmetry. For these systems we study three important properties in presence of Sense of Direction: backward consistency, name symmetry, and <b>homonymity.</b> We establish a numb [...] ...|$|E
40|$|For {{long time}} a {{quantitative}} assessment of the productivity of Italian researchers has been lacking; the first and unique assessment was the Three-Year Research Evaluation for the period 2001 - 2003. Italian Law 240 / 2010, ruling the organization of research and universities, requires a system {{for the evaluation of}} the scientific productivity of Italian researchers. In 2011, both the National Agency for the Evaluation of Universities and Research Institutes (ANVUR) and the National University Council (CUN) proposed a set of evaluation criteria based on a bibliometric approach with indexes calculated using the information from the Thomson Reuters Web of Science (WOS) or the Elsevier SciVerse SCOPUS databases. The aim of this study is twofold: (i) to present the results of an assessment of the global aggregated scientific productivity of the Italian forestry community for 1996 - 2010 using the SCOPUS data available from the on-line SCIMAGO system; and (ii) to compare the WOS and SCOPUS databases with respect to three indexes (number of publications, number of citations, h-index) of the scientific productivity for university forest researchers in Italy. Two subcategories of forestry were considered: AGR 05 - forest management and silviculture, and AGR 06 - wood technology. Out of a total of 84 authors, 76 were considered in the analysis because not affected by unresolved <b>homonymity</b> or duplication. Overall, the trend in scientific productivity for Italian forestry is promising. Italy ranked 10 th in terms of the h-index with an increasing trend in importance relative to other European countries, though the scientific contribution of authors was largely heterogeneous. Both WOS and SCOPUS databases were suitable sources of information for evaluating the scientific productivity of Italian authors. Although the two databases did not produce meaningful differences for any of the three indexes, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the two sources must be carefully considered if used operationally to evaluate the Italian scientific productivity...|$|E
