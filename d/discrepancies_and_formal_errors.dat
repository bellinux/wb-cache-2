40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to categorise <b>and</b> describe <b>formal</b> <b>errors</b> of sign language interpreters. It focuses on errors committed during interpretation from a sign language into a spoken language, e. g. from the Czech sign language into Czech. Sign language interpreting is usually simultaneous. That is why there is a chapter on the simultaneous interpretation process. Next chapter describes interpreting strategies and roles of simultaneous interpretation process participants. The subsequent part describes the specificity of sign language interpretation. In includes {{a brief history of}} interpreting for the deaf as well as equal competences of both spoken and sign languages interpreters, specific competences of sign language interpreters and an explanation of similarities and differences between spoken and sign language interpretation. The next section is focused on errors of spoken language interpreters and errors of sign language interpreters. Empirical part describes research based on recordings of <b>formals</b> <b>errors</b> of sign language interpreters. This chapter defines the research hypothesis <b>and</b> <b>formal</b> <b>errors</b> resulting from individual research and it contains an analysis of the research itself. There is an exercise for interpreters based on analysis of the research. The final part of the thesis consists of [...] ...|$|R

The major error source in these measurements is the uncertainty {{in the position of}} the GPS satellites at the time of observation. A key aspect of the first CASA experiment, CASA Uno, was the initiation of a global network of tracking stations to minimize these errors. We studied the effect of using various subsets of this global tracking network on long (3 ̆e 100 km) baseline estimates in the CASA region. Best results were obtained with a global tracking network consisting of three U. S. fiducial stations, two sites in the southwest Pacific and two sites in Europe.

Differential tracking of the GPS satellites in high Earth orbit provides a powerful relative positioning capability, even when a relatively small continental U.

To demonstrate this capability, baselines of up to 2000 km in North America were also determined with the GPS orbits.

This GPS demonstration provides an opportunity to test different techniques for high-accuracy orbit determination for high Earth orbiters. The best GPS orbit strategies included data arcs of at least 1 week, process noise models for tropospheric fluctuations, estimation of GPS solar pressure coefficients, and combine processing of GPS carrier phase and pseudorange data.

40|$|Though Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) data {{processing}} has been significantly improved over years {{it is still}} commonly observed that Zenith Tropospheric Delay (ZTD) estimates contain many outliers which are detrimental to meteorological and climatological applications. In this paper, we show that ZTD outliers in double difference processing are {{most of the time}} caused by sub-daily data gaps at reference stations which cause disconnections of clusters of stations from the reference network and common–mode biases due to the strong correlation between stations in short baselines. They can reach a few centimetres in ZTD and coincide usually with a jump in <b>formal</b> <b>errors.</b> The magnitude <b>and</b> sign of these biases are impossible to predict because they depend on different errors in the observations and on the geometry of the baselines. We elaborate and test a new baseline strategy which solves this problem and significantly reduces the number of outliers compared to the standard strategy commonly used for positioning (e. g. determination of national reference frame) in which the pre-defined network is composed of a skeleton of reference stations to which secondary stations are connected in a star-like structure. The new strategy is also shown to perform better than the widely-used strategy maximising the number of observations which available in many GNSS software. The reason is that observations are maximised before processing whereas the final number of used observations can be dramatically lower because of data rejection (screening) during the processing. The study relies on the analysis of one year of GPS (Global Positioning System) data from a regional network of 136 GNSS stations processed using Bernese GNSS Software v. 5. 2. A post-processing screening procedure is also proposed to detect and remove a few outliers which may still remain due to short data gaps. It is based on a combination of range checks and outlier checks of ZTD <b>and</b> <b>formal</b> <b>errors.</b> The accuracy of the final screened GPS ZTD estimates is assessed by comparison to ERA-Interim reanalysis...|$|R

Oral proficiency in English {{has always been}} the benchmark of language proficiency, and in the context of UiTM’s language teaching curriculum, efforts to enhance students’ oral proficiency are implemented through various language s proficiency-based and ESP courses. A small corpus of group discussions was analysed to identify and classify grammatical errors and other performance factors in students’ oral communication. The analysis was carried out using text analysis software used in corpus linguistics (Dagneaux et al, 1998, Scott, 1996). The software was used to classify grammatical errors into general categories such as grammar, word, lexical, formal, style, lexico grammar and register.

Methods: We retrospectively analyzed the database of the Prevalence Study 1998 in Tajiri (n= 497, Miyagi, Japan) and the Prevalence Study 1997 of elderly Japanese immigrants living in Brazil (n= 166, migrated from Japan and living in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area). In three Clinical Dementia Rating (CDR) groups, i. e., CDR 0 (healthy), CDR 0. 5 (questionable dementia), and CDR 1 + (dementia), the Mini-Mental State Examination (MMSE) item of spontaneous writing and the Cognitive Abilities Screening Instrument (CASI) domain of dictation were analyzed {{with regard to the}} number of Kanji <b>and</b> Kana characters. <b>Formal</b> <b>errors</b> in characters <b>and</b> pragmatic errors were also analyzed. Results: The immigrants in Brazil wrote similar numbers of Kanji or Kana characters compared to the residents of Japan.

To increase efficiency, a survey procedure that includes real-time kinematic vectors from a real-time GNSS network (RTN) was evaluated. Thirty different “hybrid” networks involving three to nine Network RTK (NRTK) vectors per mark and some static GNSS vectors were developed from surveys completed in Oregon and South Carolina. The variance-covariance matrices of the static and kinematic vectors were scaled by variance component estimation procedures to produce realistic error estimates for stochastic modeling. After least squares adjustment <b>and</b> <b>formal</b> random <b>error</b> propagation of the networks, the resulting ellipsoid heights on the passive marks had network accuracies ranging from 0. 6 to 3. 6 cm (95 % confidence).

40|$|International audienceAn {{efficient}} {{detection of}} outliers {{and a good}} knowledge of the accuracy of GPS ZTD estimates are important for optimal use of these data in meteorology and climatology. The accuracy of GPS ZTD estimates depends on many {{factors such as the}} reliability of the equipment, the number of observations, the magnitude of noise and interferences in the measurements, the quality of the troposphere model used for the data processing. As these factors may change over time, an adaptive screening and quality control is required. Here we propose a method to detect and eliminate ZTD estimates that are less accurate and/or may be classified as outliers. The method depends on parameters available {{at the end of the}} data processing such as the number of fixed ambiguities, the position and ZTD estimates <b>and</b> their <b>formal</b> <b>errors.</b> It is therefore totally independent of external data. This method is first applied to the HyMeX post-processed GPS dataset produced with GIPSY-OASIS II 6. 2 software.
