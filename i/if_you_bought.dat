It was later announced that the Saturdays had signed a contract for their show to be shown through, E! and their programme would be titled Chasing the Saturdays. The series was available on E! and later available on MTV. The series was 10 episodes long and was first broadcast on 10 January. The iTunes download included an extra-minute snippet of the show back in London and was only <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> the entire series through iTunes.|$|E

[...] Kellman selected [...] "Amor Gitano", [...] "Irreemplazable" [...] and the [...] "Get Me Bodied" [...] remix as the highlights of the EP.

60|$|The dearest hotels I {{know are}} the French--and {{certainly}} not the best. In the provinces they {{are by no means}} so cleanly as those of Italy. Their wines are generally abominable, and their cookery often disgusting. In Paris grand dinners may no doubt be had, and luxuries of every description--except the luxury of comfort. Cotton-velvet sofas and ormolu clocks stand in the place of convenient furniture; and logs of wood, at a franc a log, fail to impart to you the heat which the freezing cold of a Paris winter demands. They used to make good coffee in Paris, but even that is a thing of the past. I fancy that they import their brandy from England and manufacture their own cigars. French wines you may get good at a Paris hotel; but you would drink them as good and much cheaper <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> them in London and took them with you.|$|E

These velvet carpets on my floor have been in {{constant}} wear for ten years, and look how they wear! I never have an ingrain carpet in my house,--not even on the chambers. Velvet and Brussels cost more to begin with, but then they last. Then I cannot recommend the fashion that is creeping in of having plate instead of solid silver. Plate wears off, and has to be renewed, which comes to about the same thing in the end as <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> all solid at first. If I were beginning as Marianne is, I should just set aside a thousand dollars for my silver, and be content with a few plain articles. She should buy all her furniture at Messrs. David & Saul's. People call them dear, but their work will prove cheapest in the end, and there is an air and style about their things that can be told anywhere. Of course, you won't go to any extravagant lengths,--simplicity is a grace of itself." ...|$|E

But if you have got any money to spend you had better go with me to a stall where, the last two voyages I have been here, I laid in a stock of {{articles}} useful for trading with the Malays—looking-glasses, beads, brass buttons, bright handkerchiefs, {{and things of that}} sort. I don’t say but that one might get them cheaper in London; but in the first place, one always finds plenty of things there to spend one’s money on; and in the second place, the people here know exactly the sort of goods needed in the islands, and one can get them all at one stall instead of having to hunt about in a dozen shops for them. We are each allowed to trade on our own account up to a certain amount; and, as a rule, I find that when I get back here I can sell the curiosities I buy down in the islands, for about four times as much as the goods cost me, so if you do the same you will have more money to buy things with here than <b>if</b> <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> them now.

6000|$|... 34. I have delayed {{you by the}} {{consideration}} of these two words, only in the fear {{that they might be}} inaccurately applied to the plans I am going to lay before you; for, though they were Utopian, and though they were romantic, they might be none the worse for that. But they are neither. Utopian they are not; for they are merely a proposal to do again what has been done for hundreds of years by people whose wealth and power were as nothing compared to ours;--and romantic they are not, in the sense of self-sacrificing or eminently virtuous, for they are merely the proposal to each of you that he should live in a handsomer house than he does at present, by substituting a cheap mode of ornamentation for a costly one. You perhaps fancied that architectural beauty was a very costly thing. Far from it. It is architectural ugliness that is costly. In the modern system of architecture, decoration is immoderately expensive, because it is both wrongly placed and wrongly finished. I say first, wrongly placed. Modern architects decorate the tops of their buildings. Mediæval ones decorated the bottom.[16] That makes all the difference between seeing the ornament and not seeing it. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> <b>bought</b> some pictures to decorate such a room as this, where would you put them? On a level with the eye, I suppose, or nearly so? Not on a level with the chandelier? If you were determined to put them up there, round the cornice, {{it would be better for}} you not to buy them at all. You would merely throw your money away. And the fact is, that your money is being thrown away continually, by wholesale; and while you are dissuaded, on the ground of expense, from building beautiful windows and beautiful doors, you are continually made to pay for ornaments at the tops of your houses, which, for all the use they are of, might as well be in the moon. For instance, there is not, on the whole, a more studied piece of domestic architecture in Edinburgh than the street in which so many of your excellent physicians live--Rutland Street. I do not know if you have observed its architecture; but if you will look at it to-morrow, you will see that a heavy and close balustrade is put all along the eaves of the houses. Your physicians are not, I suppose, in the habit of taking academic and meditative walks on the roofs of their houses; and, if not, this balustrade is altogether useless,--nor merely useless, for you will find it runs directly in front of all the garret windows, thus interfering with their light, and blocking out their view of the street. All that the parapet is meant to do, is to give some finish to the façades, and the inhabitants have thus been made to pay a large sum for a piece of mere decoration. Whether it does finish the façades satisfactorily, or whether the physicians resident in the street, or their patients, are in anywise edified by the succession of pear-shaped knobs of stone on their house-tops, I leave them to tell you; only do not fancy that the design, whatever its success, is an economical one.|$|E

[...] Peter Marrack of Exclaim! gave the album a one out of ten, saying [...] "Excuse My French is almost exclusively loud and aggressive, which has become the formula {{for this type of}} thing: programmed, repetitive hi-hats, 808s and a guest verse by Rick Ross. It's the kind of sweatshop beat-making mainstream producers have learned to accept as they cash their cheques. Lyrically, Montana does what any cat on the corner can do: talk slick." ...|$|R

40|$|Nanomedicine: real {{commercial}} potential or just hype? What is {{the real}} commercial potential for nanotechnology and, in particular, nanomedicine? Depends on your definition. For example, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> think nanomedicine refers to Michael Crichton’s self-replicating nanorobots traversing the body and healing disease (as in his 2002 novel Prey), I bet you will be waiting a long time (if ever) to see commercial fruition. On the other hand, <b>if</b> <b>you</b> envision nanomedicine as listening to meditation music from your iPod nano (and, thus, healing your soul), then you are in luck as you are already experiencing commercial benefits of nanomedicine. <b>If</b> only <b>you</b> had <b>bought</b> the stock.

50|$|These {{quotations}} of Adam Smith instruct {{that foreign}} trade will just give half the encouragement to domestic industry or the productive labor of the nation, but favoring domestic commerce will assist domestic industry in ways foreign commerce could not.
