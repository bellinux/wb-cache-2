40|$|The aim {{of my work}} is {{to clarify}} the {{meteorological}} conditions which lead to forest fires and create a formula that would assessed the fire hazard {{on the basis of}} forecast of meteorological parameters. Main parts of this work are: definition and conditions of the emergence of forest fires, division of forest fires, methods of disposal of fires, methods and ways of predicting and detecting forest fires and the occurrence and areal extent of forest fires in the world and in our country, influence of drought and global warming. I evaluated forest fires in terms of meteorological factors (average daily temperature, total daily precipitation - processed by method of effective precipitation and wind speed) in the Chomutov distrikt (from 3 climatological stations) from 1998 to 2008. First I analyzed impact of individual meteorological parameters on the occurrence of forest fires during last 11 years. I drew up several formulas for calculating the hazard of fires. The formula with the best results I have named <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Index</b> and set the limits, i. e. the degree of harard. The <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Index</b> is meteorological index and it does not work with the factors of vegetation, infrastructure and topography.

40|$|Abstract—Fire hazard {{monitoring}} and evacuation for building environments {{is a novel}} application area for the deployment of wireless sensor networks. In large place such as a marketplace, it is crucial for firefighters to know the fire hazard situation, and decide on how to best tackle the disaster. Fire sensors in the traditional fire hazard monitoring system are isolated in large place, and it results in failure to remain aware of current overall fire conditions. To improve the assessment accuracy of fire situation, a novel wireless sensor network based algorithm is proposed in this paper to detect and localize the origin of fire hazard in large place. Fuzzy artificial neural network is trained by fire signal from the wireless sensor nodes, then determine whether the fire hazard occurred and estimate its situation. The smoke and temperature diffusion models in limited space are adopted to localize the origin of fire hazard. Theory analysis and experimental results show that this fire detection and localization algorithm could more accurately assess fire hazard situation in large place, which is helpful for firefighters to take measures to exterminate <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> <b>Index</b> Terms—Fire hazard detection, Fire origin localization...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Prevention {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} stages in wildfire and other natural hazard management regimes. Fire danger rating systems have been adopted by many developed countries dealing with wildfire prevention and pre-suppression planning, so that civil protection agencies are able to define areas with high probabilities of fire ignition and resort to necessary actions. This present paper presents a fire ignition risk scheme, developed in the study area of Lesvos Island, Greece, that can be an integral component of a quantitative Fire Danger Rating System. The proposed methodology estimates the geo-spatial fire risk regardless of fire causes or expected burned area, and it has the ability of forecasting based on meteorological data. The main output of the proposed scheme is the Fire Ignition Index, which is based on three other indices: Fire Weather Index, <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Index,</b> and Fire Risk Index. These indices are not just a relative probability for fire occurrence, but a rather quantitative assessment of fire danger in a systematic way. Remote sensing data from the high-resolution QuickBird and the Landsat ETM satellite sensors were utilised in order to provide part of the input parameters to the scheme, while Remote Automatic Weather Stations and the SKIRON/Eta weather forecasting system provided real-time and forecasted meteorological data, respectively. Geographic Information Systems were used for management and spatial analyses of the input parameters. The relationship between wildfire occurrence and the input parameters was investigated by neural networks whose training was based on historical data...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A climatic series (1941 to 1994) from a Mediterranean {{locality}} of NE Spain {{was used}} to calculate two wildfire <b>hazard</b> <b>indices</b> based on daily meteorological data. Both <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>indices</b> increased over this period, {{as a consequence of}} increasing mean daily maximum temperature and decreasing minimum daily relative humidity. These trends were observed in both mean values of the indices and in the number of very high risk days. Annual data on the number of wildfires and burned area also show an increase from 1968 to 1994, and are significantly correlated with both <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>indices.</b> Although other non-meteorological causes (e. g., human activities, fuel accumulation) have likely contributed to the observed increase of wildfires, an effect of climatic warming on wildfire occurrence is supported by this relationship. 1...|$|R
40|$|Most {{countries}} of Mediterranean Europe are strongly affected by forest fires, with major socio-economic and environmental impacts that can spread over several regions and countries. A transnational approach allows creating synergies regarding resource sharing and problem-solving strategies. The access to high quality and up-to-date information {{is critical to}} improve <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> mitigation measures and promote comparable appraisals between different regions. Several collaborative initiatives have been implemented in Europe to foster research and service development, focusing on common issues amongst countries. The PREFER project {{was one of these}} initiatives, with the purpose of contributing to protect human communities and forests from <b>fire</b> <b>hazard,</b> by providing cartographic products through the implementation of a new systematic framework. The participation of end users, such as civil protection organizations and forest services, covering the Euro-Mediterranean region, was crucial to ensure the operational application of the mapping products. Fuel classification, daily <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>indices,</b> vulnerability assessment and damage severity levels were some of the mapping applications developed for several test areas in Mediterranean Europe. This chapter illustrates the potential enhancements for forest fire management offered by this framework, bearing in mind the benefits of applying shared and harmonized approaches for common issues. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|During {{the last}} fifteen years the {{landscape}} of the Vale do Alto Tâmega, a region in Northern Portugal, has been subjected to environmental pressure leading to a change in land cover from predominantly forest to a mixture of shrub and rock outcrops. Both natural (e. g. wild fires) and anthropogenic (e. g. timber harvesting) factors have contributed to this change. Practical management techniques are necessary to preserve and manage this important environmental resource. New technologies, such as Geographical Information Systems (GIS), the Global Positioning System (GPS) and Remote Sensing (RS) provide tools {{that can be used for}} forest management and wild fire protection. This thesis explores the suitability of these technologies for managing forests located in the Vale do Alto Tamega region. It focuses on the development of data sets and models that can be used to assess the susceptibility of forests to <b>fire</b> <b>hazards.</b> The GIS analysis reveals that more than half of the study area presents a high <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> and nearly a third of the Pinus pinaster stands were burnt between 1986 and 1995. The GIS results also show that much forest land is occupied by unsuitable species (e. g. coniferous instead of deciduous trees), which contribute to restricted timber production and a high <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> GPS was used to survey both the location of sampling plots and to map the boundaries of burnt areas or of post-fire recover areas, associated with traditional forest mapping and measurement techniques. These data were then used to update GIS and to support satellite image classification. Remote sensing derived data were used for mapping, providing up¬to-date land cover maps, and to derive predictive relationships which can be used to estimate forest biophysical variables (e. g. Leaf Area Index or Biomass) that can be used by forest managers. The results of the research demonstrate that GIS, GPS and RS could be used together in forest management and protection, such as in the classification of the land cover in order to calculate <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>indices</b> or in the analysis of forests dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The {{management}} of hazards and {{risks associated with}} the inherent characteristics of chemicals constitutes {{one of the biggest}} challenges of our modern world. Relative ranking and hazard indices are among the widespread hazard assessment techniques. In this paper, a new approach for the relative hazard assessment is introduced, treating the issue as a multi-criteria decision making problem, as quite often more than one parameters, or criteria, should be taken into account. Based on this approach, a methodology has been developed, aiming at the rapid assessment and relative ranking of chemical hazards, employing a multi-criteria technique, the Analytic Hierarchy Process, AHP, and also Fuzzy Logic as a more efficient tool in handling both linguistic variables and uncertainties present in hazard assessment. Using the proposed methodology, a number of hazard indices have been developed and are presented: The Substance <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Index,</b> proposed as a tool for the relative ranking and assessment of chemicals based on their fire hazard properties, the Substance Toxicity Hazard Index, introduced as a screening / relative ranking tool of toxic substances, and the 'Consequences Index', for ranking installations based on their 'consequences potential', the consequences that would result from the worst case accident scenario (fire, explosion, toxic release) at an installation that uses, produces, stores hazardous materials. Finally, the challenges and limitations of using the multicriteria approach for the development of relative ranking and assessment indices are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Fire {{danger rating}} {{systems have been}} adopted by many {{developed}} countries dealing with wildfire prevention and presuppression planning, so that civil protection agencies are able to define areas with high probabilities of fire ignition and resort to necessary actions. This dissertation focuses {{on the development of}} a fire ignition risk scheme that can be an integral component of a quantitative Fire Danger Rating System. The methodology used, estimates the geo-spatial fire risk regardless of fire causes or expected burned area, while it has the ability of forecasting based on meteorological data. The main output of the scheme is the Fire Ignition Index (FII) which is based on three other indices: the Fire Weather Index (FWI); the <b>Fire</b> <b>Hazard</b> <b>Index</b> (FHI); and the Fire Risk Index (FRI). These indices are not just a relative probability of fire occurrence, but a rather quantitative assessment of fire danger in a systematic way. Remote sensing data have been utilized in order to retrieve part of the input parameters to the scheme, while Remote Automatic Weather Stations and the SKIRON/Eta weather forecasting system provided real-time and forecasted meteorological data, respectively. The relationship between wildfire occurrence and the input parameters has been investigated by neural networks, whose training was based on historical data. The FWI function was more easily approached, while the FRI had better classification percentages regarding the validation fires. According to the operational validation under realistic conditions, the FII identified the high risk areas where most of the fire ignited. The dissertation also presents the results of sensitivity analysis performed in a back-propagation neural network in order to distinguish the influence of each variable in the proposed fire ignition risk scheme. To evaluate the three indices developed within the above scheme, 5 different methods were used. Results showed that the presence of rainfall, the 10 -h fuel moisture content and the month of the year parameter are the most significant variables of the FWI, FHI and FRI, respectively. On the contrary, relative humidity, elevation and day of the week have a small contribution to fire ignitions in the study area. The results retrieved by sensitivity analysis can be used by forest managers and other decision-makers dealing with wildfires in order to take the appropriate preventive measures, emphasizing on the important factors of fire occurrence. ...|$|E
40|$|To {{control and}} use {{wildland}} fires safely and effectively depends on creditable assessments of fire potential, including the propensity for crowning in conifer forests. Simulation studies that use certain fire modelling systems (i. e. NEXUS, FlamMap, FARSITE, FFE-FVS (Fire and Fuels Extension to the Forest Vegetation Simulator), Fuel Manage- ment Analyst (FMAPlus!), BehavePlus) based on separate implementations or direct integration of Rothermel’s surface and crown {{rate of fire}} spread models with Van Wagner’s crown fire transition and propagation models are shown {{to have a significant}} underprediction bias when used in assessing potential crown fire behaviour in conifer forests of western North America. The principal sources of this underprediction bias are shown to include: (i) incompatible model linkages; (ii) use of surface and crown fire rate of spread models that have an inherent underprediction bias; and (iii) reduction in crown fire rate of spread based on the use of unsubstantiated crown fraction burned functions. The use of uncalibrated custom fuel models to represent surface fuelbeds is a fourth potential source of bias. These sources are described and documented in detail based on comparisons with experimental fire and wildfire observations and on separate analyses of model components. The manner in which the two primary canopy fuel inputs influencing crown fire initiation (i. e. foliar moisture content and canopy base height) is handled in these simulation studies and the meaning of Scott and Reinhardt’s two crown <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> <b>indices</b> are also critically examined...|$|R
40|$|Fire {{managers}} are increasingly {{concerned about the}} threat of crown fires, yet only now are quantitative methods for assessing crown <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> being developed. Links among existing mathematical models of fire behavior are used to develop two indices of crown fire hazard—the Torching Index and Crowning Index. These indices {{can be used to}} ordinate different forest stands by their relative susceptibility to crown fire and to compare the effectiveness of crown fire mitigation treatments. The coupled model was used to simulate the wide range of fire behavior possible in a forest stand, from a low-intensity surface fire to a high-intensity active crown fire, for the purpose of comparing potential <b>fire</b> behavior. The <b>hazard</b> <b>indices</b> and behavior simulations incorporate the effects of surface fuel characteristics, dead and live fuel moistures (surface and crown), slope steepness, canopy base height, canopy bulk density, and wind reduction by the canopy.

40|$|This work {{investigated}} experimentally and theoretically the <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> of thermal-insulation {{materials used}} in diesel locomotives under different radiation heat fluxes. Based on the experimental results, the critical heat flux for ignition {{was determined to be}} 6. 15 kW/m 2 and 16. 39 kW/m 2 for pure polyurethane and aluminum-polyurethane respectively. A theoretical model was established for both to predict the fire behaviors under different circumstances. The fire behavior of the materials was evaluated based on the flashover and the total heat release rate (HRR). The <b>fire</b> <b>hazards</b> levels were classified based on different experimental results. It was found that the fire resistance performance of aluminum-polyurethane is much better than that of pure-polyurethane under various external heat fluxes. The concentration of toxic pyrolysis volatiles generated from aluminum-polyurethane materials is much higher than that of pure polyurethane materials, especially when the heat flux is below 50 kW/m 2. The <b>hazard</b> <b>index</b> HI during peak width time was proposed based on the comprehensive impact of time and concentrations.

40|$|Various <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> {{rating systems}} {{have been used by}} many {{countries}} at strategic and tactical levels for fire prevention and fire safety programs. Assigning subjective weight to parameters that cause <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> has been widely used to model wildland <b>fire</b> <b>hazard.</b> However, these methods are sensitive to experts' judgements because they are independent of any statistical approaches. Therefore, in the present study, we propose a wildland <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> method based on frequency analysis (i. e. a probability distribution model) to identify the locations of <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> in north-eastern Iran, which has frequent fire. The proposed methodology uses factors that do not change or change very slowly over time to identify static <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> areas, such as vegetation moisture, slope, aspect, elevation, distance from roads and proximity to settlements, as essential parameters. Several probability distributions are assigned to each factor to show the possibility of fire using non-linear regressions. The results show that approximately 86 % of MODerate-resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) hot spot data are located truly in the high <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> areas as identified in the present study and the most significant contributing factor to fire in Golestan Province, Iran, is elevation. The present study also reveals that approximately 14 % of the total study area (∼ 20368 km 2) has a <b>fire</b> <b>hazard</b> of 66 %, which can be considered very high.
