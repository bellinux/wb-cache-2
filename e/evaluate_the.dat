50|$|However, {{in other}} cases, <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> sum-gradient may require {{expensive}} {{evaluations of the}} gradients from all summand functions.

5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the first opportunity for KSC and <b>evaluate</b> <b>the</b> second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E

30|$|Taken individually, <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> {{professional}} affiliation of {{an information}} source or <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of the}} evidence itself is, in many cases, a logically sound strategy to make credibility and trustworthiness judgements in the context of online health information. First, <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> professional affiliation of a source can inform information seekers about whether the information source has sound knowledge of the content at hand. For example, an information source who underwent years of university and practical training in medicine will likely {{have a better understanding of}} health-related topics than a novice in <b>the</b> field. Second, <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of the evidence}} itself can also lead to accurate judgements about the evidence’s credibility and trustworthiness. For example, from a scientific perspective, a health-related claim seems to be more reliable if it has been proven in various scientific studies rather than if it is solely grounded in the private experience of one individual. However, while both of these factors (<b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> professional affiliation and <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> nature of evidence) are important in making credibility and trustworthiness judgements, in reality, it is often not enough to just evaluate a source’s professional affiliation or just look at whether he bases his claims on scientific studies. To make accurate credibility and trustworthiness judgements in real-world situations, information seekers must evaluate how these two factors interact with each other, because <b>evaluating</b> <b>the</b> two factors in isolation could result in potentially wrong conclusions.|$|R
