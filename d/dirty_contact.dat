6000|$|And yet the Scripture {{does most}} {{certainly}} {{speak of the}} Lord's coming out of His place to visit--of the Son of Man coming, and not coming to men--of His visiting us at one time and not at another. How does that agree with what I have just said? My dear friends, we shall see that it agrees perfectly with what I have said, if we will only just remember {{that we are not}} beasts, but men. It may seem a strange thing to have to remind people of, but it is just what they are always forgetting. My friends, we are not animals, we are not spiders to do nothing but spin, or birds only to build nests for ourselves, much less swine to do nothing but dig after roots and fruits, and get what we can out of the clods of the ground. We are the children of the Most High God; we have immortal souls within us; nay, more, we are our souls: our bodies are our husk--our shell--our clothes--our house--changing day by day, and year by year upon us, one day to drop off us till the Resurrection. But WE are our SOULS, and when God visits, it is our souls He visits, not merely our bodies. There is the whole secret. People forget God, and therefore they are glad to fancy that He has forgotten them, and {{has nothing to do with}} this world of His which they are misusing for their own selfish ends; and then God in His mercy visits them. He knocks at the door of their hearts, saying: [...] "See! I was close to you all the while." [...] He forces them to see Him and to confess that He is there whether they choose or not. God is not away from the world. He is away from people's hearts, because He has given people free wills, and with free wills the power of keeping Him out of their hearts or letting Him in. And when God visits He forces Himself on our attention. He knocks at the door of our hard hearts so loudly and sharply that He forces all to confess that He is there--all who are not utterly reprobate and spiritually dead. In blessings as well as in curses, God knocks at our hearts. By sudden good fortune, as well as by sudden mishap; by a great deliverance from enemies, by an abundant harvest, as well as by famine and pestilence. Therefore this cholera has been a true visitation of God. The poor had fancied that they might be as dirty, the rich had fancied that they might be as careless, as they chose; in short, that they might break God's laws of cleanliness and brotherly care without His troubling Himself about the matter. And lo! He has visited us; and shown us that He does care about the matter by taking it into His own hands with a vengeance. He who cannot see God's hand in the cholera must be as blind--as blind as who?--as blind as he that cannot see God's hand when there is no cholera; as blind as he who cannot see God's hand in every meal he eats, and every breath he draws; for that man is stone blind--he can be no blinder. The cholera came; everyone ought to see that it did not come by blind chance, but by the will of some wise and righteous Person; for in the first place God gave us fair warning. The cholera came from India at a steady pace. We knew to a month when it would arrive here. And it came, too, by no blind necessity, as if it was forced to take people whether it liked or not. Just as it was in the fever here, so it was in the cholera, [...] "One shall be taken and another left." [...] It took one of a street and left another; took one person in a family and left another: it took the rich man who fancied he was safe, as well as the poor man who did not care whether he was safe or not. The respectable man walking home to his comfortable house, passed by some untrapped drain, and then poisonous gas struck him and he died. The rich physician who had been curing others, could not save himself from the poison of the crowded graveyard which had been allowed to remain at the back of his house. By all sorts of strange and unfathomable judgments the cholera showed itself to be working, not by a blind necessity, but at the will of a thinking Person, of a living God, whose ways are not as our own ways, and His paths are in the great deep. And yet the cholera showed--and this is what I want to make you feel--that it was working at the will of the same God in whom we live and move and have our being, who sends the food we eat, the water in which we wash, the air we breathe, and who has ordained for all these things natural laws, according to which they work, and which He never breaks, nor allows us to break them. For every case of cholera could be traced to some breaking of these laws--foul air--foul food--foul water, or careless and <b>dirty</b> <b>contact</b> with infected persons; so that by this God showed that He and not chance ruled the world, and that he was indeed the living and willing God. He showed at the same time that He was the wise God of order and of law; and that gas and earth, wind and vapour, fulfil His word, without His having to break His laws, or visit us by moving, as people fancy, out of a Heaven where He was, down to an earth, where He was not.|$|E

40|$|Objective: In this study, we {{aimed to}} define {{effects of the}} endemic infective {{processes}} on the hand-washing habits of the emergency department staff {{in contact with the}} patients. Methods: The study was prospectively conducted in Emergency Clinic of Ankara Numune Training and Research Hospital. Information recorded in the study forms consisted of the title of health care staff, type of the contact with the patients, whether the hands were washed before and after the contact with the patients, duration of the hand-washing, using soap or disinfectant, hand-drying, proper use of the glove and whether the gloves were destroyed in a proper way. Ki-kare test assay was used in the statistical analysis and p< 0. 05 values were considered significant. Results: Following all the clean and <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts,</b> hand washing was made in 237 (28. 9 %) of total 819 contacts. Of the total 819 contacts, 538 (65. 7 %) were found to be clean and 281 (34. 3 %) <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts.</b> Incidence of the hand-washing was found as 84 times (15. 6 %) in 538 clean and 153 times (54. 4 %) in 281 <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts.</b> Frequency of the hand-washing was found higher in the dirty than in the clean contacts. Totally, 462 gloves were used during the study. When areas of use for 462 gloves were examined, it was observed that 219 gloves (47. 4 %) was used in the clean and 243 gloves (52. 6 %) in the <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts.</b> It was found during the observation that, soap was used in 134 (56. 5 %), while nosoap was used in 103 (43. 5 %) of 237 hand-washing. Papertowel was defined to be used in 123 (51. 9 %) of 237. Inaddition, durations of the hand-washing following theclean and <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts</b> were also examined duringthe study. Durations of the hand-washing were foundlonger after the dirty than after the clean contacts. Nosignificant difference was found between the genders interms of the duration and incidence of the hand-washing. In the period before the study, number of the personnelwho had experienced hospital-acquired infections wasfound higher than those had not experienced. Conclusion: In the emergency department in whichthe study was conducted, incidence of the hand-washingwas found to be more than in the previous studies, butstill it was not at a desired level...|$|R

40|$|The {{volt-ampere}} {{curves and}} their second derivatives were studied for niobium point contacts at low {{temperatures in the}} voltage range corresponding to the characteristic phonon energies. It was found that while for the <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts</b> in the normal state no PC spectra of phonons could be detected, in the superconducting state there were singularities in the I-V curves corresponding to maxima either in the first or in the second derivatives. The singularities observed were due to the energy dependence of the excess current. We suppose that the origin of these singularities {{is due to the}} inelastic transitions of electrons between chemical potentials of Cooper pairs at both sides of the contact, which differ in energy by eV. These transitions are possible if ξ(0) ≳ d ∼Λ_ε (ξ (0) being the coherence length, d, the contact diameter, Λ_ε=(l_i·l_ε) ^ 1 / 2, where l_i and l_ε being the elastic and inelastic electron mean free paths, respectively).

40|$|The {{nonlinearities}} of current-voltage characteristics (IVC) of superconducting niobium point contacts for voltages of {{the order}} of the characteristic phonon frequencies are investigated. It is shown that in limiting by <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts</b> l_ 1 ≪ d, (l_ 1 is the momentum mean-free path of electrons), features are observed on the IVC corresponding to maxima in the first or second derivatives and are situated at energies close to the characteristic phonon energies. These features are due to the energy dependence of the excess current, since the nonlinearity of the IVC in the normal state is several times smaller in absolute magnitude, and its second derivative is monotonic. For a contact diameter d {{of the order}} of several tens of angstroms (the contact resistance is {{of the order of}} 100 Ω), the thermal effects can be neglected. It is assumed that in the region of the constriction, the characteristic lengths of the system satisfy the relation ξ≳ d>Λ_ε (Λ_ε is the diffusion length for energy relaxation of the electrons, ξ is the coherence length) which makes possible inelastic transitions of electrons between pair chemical potentials differing in energy by an account eV (V is the voltage drop across the contact) Comment: 8 pages, 4 figure...|$|R
40|$|The {{point-contact}} {{spectra of}} tantalum in the superconducting state, with Ta, Cu, and Au counterelectrodes, have been studied. We discovered some new distinctive features, whose {{position on the}} eV axis {{is determined by the}} critical power required for the injection of nonequilibriumquasiparticles. At this level of power the band gap Δ decreases abruptly {{in the vicinity of the}} contact. A correction to the point-contact spectrum, with the sign opposite to that of the usual correction, arises in the region of phonon energies. The maxima in the Ta spectrum become sharper and their position on the energy axis becomes stabilized near the values eV_ph= 7. 0, 11. 3, 15. 5, and 18 meV, which correspond to low phonon group velocities ∂ω /∂ q≃ 0 in Ta. This is confirmed by the existence of corresponding flattenings on the dispersion relations ω (q) of lattice vibrations. Slow phonons are created near the N-S interface in quasiparticle recombination and relaxation processes and cause a decrease in Δ and an increase in the differential resistance in the vicinity of eV_ph. An excess quasiparticle charge is accumulated in the region of the contact, producing a correction to the resistance, which decreases as eV, T, and H increase. These mechanisms are particularly effective in <b>dirty</b> <b>contacts,</b> thus permitting phonon spectroscopy in the superconducting state even when the current flow occurs in a nearly thermal mode.

40|$|Within the {{formalism}} of Usadel equations the Josephson {{effect in}} <b>dirty</b> point <b>contacts</b> between single-band and three-band superconductors is investigated. The general expression for the Josephson current, which is valid for arbitrary temperatures, is obtained. We calculate current-phase relations for very low temperature {{and in the}} vicinity of the critical temperature. For three-band superconductors with broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) point contacts undergo frustration phenomena with different current-phase relations, corresponding to ϕ-contacts. For three-band superconductors without BTRS we have close to sinusoidal current-phase relations and absence of the frustration, excepting the case of very low temperature, where under certain conditions two ground states of the point contact are realized. Our results can be used as the potential probe for the detection of the possible BTRS state in three-band superconducting systems. Comment: 14 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{behavior}} of a dc SQUID, based on a <b>dirty</b> point <b>contacts</b> between a single-band and three-band superconductor with broken time-reversal symmetry is investigated. Using earlier obtained results for Josephson effects in such systems new features in characteristics of a dc SQUID are revealed. It is shown {{that in the case}} of a BTRS (broken time-reversal symmetry) three-band superconductor for the applied external magnetic flux, which is divisible by the half-integer flux, strong degeneracy of ground states of a dc SQUID is taken place. This can lead to the appearance of possible multi-hysteresis loops on a dependence of a total flux in the dc SQUID from the externally applied flux. The number of these loops depends on the position of ground states of a three-band superconductor. Also it is found that dependencies of a critical current on applied magnetic flux can have complicated multi-periodic forms, which are differ from strictly periodic characteristics for conventional dc SQUIDs and Fraunhofer patterns for Josephson contacts in the external magnetic field.

40|$|Slowly driven elastic interfaces, such as domain {{walls in}} <b>dirty</b> magnets, <b>contact</b> lines, or cracks proceed via {{intermittent}} motion, called avalanches. We develop a field-theoretic treatment to calculate, from first principles, the space-time statistics of instantaneous velocities within an avalanche. For elastic interfaces at (or above) their (internal) upper critical dimension d >= d_uc (d_uc = 2, 4 respectively for long-ranged and short-ranged elasticity) {{we show that}} the field theory for the center of mass reduces to the motion of a point particle in a random-force landscape, which is itself a random walk (ABBM model). Furthermore, the full spatial dependence of the velocity correlations is described by the Brownian-force model (BFM) where each point of the interface sees an independent Brownian-force landscape. Both ABBM and BFM can be solved exactly in any dimension d (for monotonous driving) by summing tree graphs, equivalent to solving a (non-linear) instanton equation. This tree approximation is the mean-field theory (MFT) for realistic interfaces in short-ranged disorder. Both for the center of mass, and for a given Fourier mode q, we obtain probability distribution functions (PDF's) of the velocity, {{as well as the}} avalanche shape and its fluctuations (second shape). Within MFT we find that velocity correlations at non-zero q are asymmetric under time reversal. Next we calculate, beyond MFT, i. e. including loop corrections, the 1 -time PDF of the center-of-mass velocity du/dt for dimension d< d_uc. The singularity at small velocity P(du/dt) ~ 1 /(du/dt) ^a is substantially reduced from a= 1 (MFT) to a = 1 - 2 / 9 (4 -d) + [...] . (short-ranged elasticity) and a = 1 - 4 / 9 (2 -d) + [...] . (long-ranged elasticity). We show how the dynamical theory recovers the avalanche-size distribution, and how the instanton relates to the response to an infinitesimal step in the force.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nappy rash {{accounts}} for 20 % of dermatology consultations in childhood, but its causes are poorly understood. AIM: To determine {{the incidence of}} nappy rash during the first four weeks {{of life in a}} geographically defined United Kingdom (UK) population, and to study the factors associated with developing the rash. METHOD: The data are derived from self-completed questionnaires of parents in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Pregnancy and Childhood (ALSPAC). The response rate to a questionnaire about the child administered four weeks after delivery among parents of singleton infants was 87 % (12103 / 13902). RESULTS: The incidence of nappy rash was 25 %. Fourteen highly significant possible causal factors emerged, of which 10 were retained in a logistic regression model: <b>dirtying</b> of nappy, <b>contact</b> with doctor about other problems, history of rashes in joints or skin creases, type of nappy worn, being fed cereal, taken to mother's bed when waking at night, history of cradle cap, general state of health, previous stomach upset, and being only breast-fed. However, the relative risks were generally small. CONCLUSIONS: The likelihood of nappy rash increases with intercurrent illness and early introduction of cereals. Disposable nappies give little protection, and this finding helps to endorse a recently introduced hospital scheme arising from environmental concerns that encourages parents to use cotton nappies instead of disposables. For many babies, however, the causes of nappy rash remain unknown...|$|R
40|$|Rent {{control in}} Sweden {{has been a}} subject to much research, debate and criticism. The reasons for this are many. The housing market, {{particularly}} in central parts of Stockholm, has foundered {{in the sense that}} it´s necessary to have <b>contacts,</b> <b>dirty</b> money or to use illegal methods to gain a tenancy in the city. To wait in line for 20 years to acquire an apartment is not an option for most. Some argue that the solution to this problem is to let market forces govern, that it would release new apartments and the construction of rental properties would increase. Others argue that the current system is essential to financial and social diversity in the inner city. As a matter of fact is that the rental market in other countries in Europe has become more market driven. In this essay I begin by explaining concepts that are central to understanding the discussion of rent control in Sweden. Furthermore I provide a thorough history of rent control in Sweden and analyze the concepts I have previously described. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to create an  nderstanding of how the parties in the rental market looks at the current system. Inconcrete terms, I investigate their views on how the system works and could be developed. I interview people with insight into the current system and let them argue for what is good and bad about the system, and what the alternative could be. Thesis leads to conclusions that the current system is not used as originally intended and that it has been difficult to implement policy changes concerning the housing market. I also make some conclusions about why the current system has remained for so long, in spite of problems in the housing market. ...|$|R
