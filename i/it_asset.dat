40|$|Why do some {{employees}} invest {{their own time}} and money to acquire consumer information technology (IT) for use in the workplace as corporate IT? This behaviour occurs even when their firms already possess considerable IT resources. Moreover, IT governance policies typically oppose the use of unsanctioned IT within the firm. IT governance assumes that the only <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> that are relevant to the firm are those that are owned by the firm. However, employees can create value for the firm by combining their personal <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> with the firm's <b>IT</b> <b>assets.</b> Creating novel asset combinations is consistent with entrepreneurship but entrepreneurship theory does not address this type of voluntary employee entrepreneurship using personal <b>IT</b> <b>assets.</b> This article proposes a link between the theory of the firm and entrepreneurship theory to explain why employees act entrepreneurially. This link is significant because it advances the notion that employees of established firms can be entrepreneurial when they use their own consumer IT as corporate IT. This link is also significant because it suggests that managing employee entrepreneurship requires tolerance of value creation that is emergent and can occur within a firm...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{evidence}} of {{a positive relationship between}} information technology (IT) investments and firm performance, results still vary across firms and performance measures. We explore two organizational explanations for this variation: differences in firms’ IT investment allocations and their IT capabilities. We develop a theoretical model of IT resources, defined as the combination of specific <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> and organizational <b>IT</b> capabilities. We argue that investments into different <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> are guided by firms’ strategies (e. g., cost leadership or innovation) and deliver value along performance dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. We hypothesize that firms derive additional value per IT dollar through a mutually reinforcing system of organizational IT capabilities built on complementary practices and competencies. Empirically, we test the impact of <b>IT</b> <b>assets,</b> <b>IT</b> capabilities, and their combination on four dimensions of firm performance: market valuation, profitability, cost, and innovation. Our results—based on data on IT investment allocations and IT capabilities in 147 U. S. firms from 1999 to 2002 —demonstrate that IT investment allocations and organizational IT capabilities drive differences in firm performance. Firms’ total IT investment is not associated with performance, but investments in specific <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> explain performance differences along dimensions consistent with their strategic purpose. In addition, a system of organizational IT capabilities strengthens the performance effects of <b>IT</b> <b>assets</b> and broadens their impact beyond their intended purpose. The results help explain variance in returns to IT capital across firms and expand our understanding of alignment between IT and organizations. We illustrate our findings with examples from a case study of 7 -Eleven JapanNYU, Stern School of Business, IOMS department, Center for Digital Economy Researc...|$|R
