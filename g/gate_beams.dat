40|$|The {{clinical}} {{advantage for}} protons over conventional high-energy x-rays stems from their unique depth-dose distribution, which delivers essentially no dose beyond {{the end of}} range. In order to achieve it, accurate localization of the tumor volume relative to the proton beam is necessary. For cases where the tumor moves with respiration, the resultant dose distribution is sensitive to such motion. One way to reduce uncertainty caused by respiratory motion is to use <b>gated</b> <b>beam</b> delivery. The main goal of this dissertation is to evaluate the respiratory gating technique in both passive scattering and scanning delivery mode. Our hypothesis for the study was that optimization of the parameters of synchrotron operation and respiratory gating can lead to greater efficiency and accuracy of respiratory gating for all modes of synchrotron-based proton treatment delivery. The hypothesis is tested in two specific aims. The specific aim # 1 is to assess the efficiency of respiratory-gated proton beam delivery and optimize the synchrotron operations for the gated proton therapy. A simulation study was performed and introduced an efficient synchrotron operation pattern, called variable Tcyc. In addition, the simulation study estimated the efficiency in the respiratory <b>gated</b> scanning <b>beam</b> delivery mode as well. The specific aim # 2 is to assess the accuracy of beam delivery in respiratory-gated proton therapy. The simulation study was extended to the passive scattering mode to estimate the quality of pulsed beam delivery to the residual motion for several synchrotron operation patterns with the gating technique. The results showed that variable Tcyc operation can offer good reproducible beam delivery to the residual motion at a certain phase of the motion. For respiratory <b>gated</b> scanning <b>beam</b> delivery, the impact of motion on the dose distributions by scanned beams was investigated by measurement. The results showed the threshold for motion {{for a variety of}} scan patterns and the proper number of paintings for normal and respiratory <b>gated</b> <b>beam</b> deliveries. The results of specific aims 1 and 2 provided supporting data for implementation of the respiratory <b>gating</b> <b>beam</b> delivery technique into both passive and scanning modes and the validation of the hypothesis...|$|R

40|$|Abstract This thesis investigates exciton polaritons in GaAs {{microcavity}}. Exciton polaritons are the eigenstates of the microcavity {{in strong}} coupling regime. In this thesis, we realize polariton lasing {{in a high}} Q microcavity and micropillars; and to manipulate polariton condensate flow along a 1 D waveguide by using optical/spin method. A high Q microcavity is investigated at low temperature and high temperature. Polariton lasing is observed only at low temperature. Micropillars are etched from the high Q microcavity. Polariton lasing threshold decreases with reducing pillar size due to strong lateral confinement, which favors polariton energy relaxation, thermalization and avoidance of exciton diffusion. A monotonic increase of the polariton lasing threshold with temperature is found {{which is consistent with}} the relation between the critical density of polariton condensate and temperature in quasi-thermalization regime. By using polariton lasing at high wave vector states observed in the planar microcavity, we realize a polariton condensate flow along a microcavity ridge. The propagation of the condensate occurs due to polariton exciton reservoir interaction. In addition, we can manipulate the polariton condensate flow through a much weaker <b>gate</b> <b>beam.</b> The above transistor switch could be employed to make spin devices. Firstly, we observe spin polarization oscillation of the polariton condensate flow due to the effect magnetic field generated by the TE-TM mode splitting. Secondly, a polariton condensate flow without spin polarization oscillation is found when the laser is in pulse mode. Finally, a spin dependent blueshift is introduced by making the <b>gate</b> <b>beam</b> circular polarized. The polariton condensate in different spin polarization could be reflected or transmitted through the gate spot. The <b>gate</b> <b>beam</b> acts as a spin filter to separate the polariton condensate with different spin polarization. All these work paves the way to the application of polariton circuits or spin circuits. The spatial control of the polariton condensate flow in the waveguide allows the implementation of polariton transistors or spin filters suitable in both optoelectronic and all-optical/spin schemes...|$|R

40|$|Irradiation {{of moving}} targets using a scanned ion beam can cause {{clinically}} intolerable under- and overdosages within the target volume {{due to the}} interplay effect. Several motion mitigation techniques such as <b>gating,</b> <b>beam</b> tracking and rescanning are currently investigated to overcome this restriction. To enable detailed experimental studies of potential mitigation techniques a complex thorax phantom was developed. The phantom consists of an artificial thorax with ribs to introduce density changes. The contraction of the thorax can be controlled by a stepping motor. A robotic driven detector head positioned inside the thorax mimics e. g. a lung tumour. The detector head comprises 20 ionization chambers and 5 radiographic films for target dose measurements. The phantom's breathing {{as well as the}} 6 D tumour motion (3 D translation, 3 D rotation) can be programmed independently and adjusted online. This flexibility allows studying the dosimetric effects of correlation mismatches between internal and external motions, irregular breathing, or baseline drifts to name a few.

They are used to control the 4 D treatment delivery and to generate data for 4 D dose calculation.

40|$|Aims: To assess optimal {{parameters}} {{and procedures for}} respiratory gated radiotherapy by using an organ motion model. Methods: A parameterised model is presented that describes the duty cycle {{as a function of}} a number of parameters; the planning position, the machine gating position and the margin size. Respiratory motion is simulated by both simple sinusoidal motion and a more clinically realistic breathing model that allows the target position at exhalation to be modelled more accurately. Patient data were used to assess uncertainties in motion amplitude and phase reproducibility. The optimal gating position was evaluated based on NTCP calculations and as a compromise between a decrease in residual motion and increased delivery time. Results: The maximum duty cycle can be achieved by choosing end of exhale as the planning position and using a machine gating position shortly before the exhalation position. The exact choice of these positions depends on the acceptable dose variation and on the margin size. Planning at the exhalation position also results in a smaller residual motion within the beam on period for a selected duty cycle. Clinical respiratory data show that the exhalation positions are most reproducible and have the smallest variation in motion amplitude (2. 2 mm at exhalation versus 5. 9 mm at inhalation). Gating at inhalation has the advantage of the lung volume being at its largest. However, the position at which the fractional treated lung volume is smallest depends on the margin size and the individual lung volume increase. A comparison of the NTCP indicates only a minor dosimetric advantage for gating at inhalation. Conclusion: The model has the potential to indicate whether the tumour mobility justifies implementing gating for a particular patient. If gating is justifiable then the model assists the choice of the most appropriate gating parameters. The results suggest end of exhalation for <b>gated</b> <b>beam</b> delivery...|$|R
40|$|In {{treatment}} of motion affected tumours {{by means of}} a scanned particle beam severe under and over dosage can occur due to the interplay effect. By using <b>gated</b> <b>beam</b> delivery effective target motion is reduced, but even for the residual motion the interplay effect can lead to unsatisfactory dose distributions. Furthermore, an appropriate motion monitoring system is essential since beam delivery has to be synchronized to target motion. In this work three aspects were investigated to move gating closer towards clinical operation at Heidelberg Ion-Beam Therapy Center (HIT) : Firstly, influences of beam parameters on dosimetric effects of residual motion were investigated in experiments and simulations. Increased focus sizes and reduced iso-energy distances {{turned out to be an}} effective method to gain dose homogeneity whereas reduction of lateral beam position spacing did not show such an effect. Secondly, to enable systematic studies of mitigation techniques and effects of miscorrelation between motion monitoring system and tumour motion a phantom with 6 D target and independent thorax motion was constructed and validated successfully in experiments. Thirdly, two motion monitoring systems by VisionRT Ltd. and Anzai Medical Co.,Ltd., respectively, were compared in terms of gating delays and correlation to tumour motion extracted from MV-fluoroscopy.

40|$|Real-time tumor {{targeting}} {{involves the}} continuous realignment of the radiation beam with the tumor. Real-time tumor targeting offers several advantages such as improved accuracy of tumor treatment and reduced dose to surrounding tissue. Current limitations to this technique include mechanical motion constraints. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate an alternative treatment scenario using a moving average algorithm. The algorithm, using a suitable averaging period, accounts for variations in the average tumor position, but respiratory induced target position variations about this average are ignored during delivery and can be treated as a random error during planning. In order to test the method a comparison between five different treatment techniques was performed: (1) moving average algorithm, (2) real-time motion tracking, (3) respiration motion gating (at both inhale and exhale), (4) moving average gating (at both inhale and exhale) and (5) static beam delivery. Two data sets were used for the purpose of this analysis: (a) external respiratory-motion traces using different coaching techniques included 331 respiration motion traces from 24 lung-cancer patients acquired using three different breathing types [free breathing (FB), audio coaching (A) and audio-visual biofeedback (AV) ]; (b) 3 D tumor motion included implanted fiducial motion data for over 160 treatment fractions for 46 thoracic and abdominal cancer patients obtained from the Cyberknife Synchrony. The metrics used for comparison were the group systematic error (M), the standard deviation (SD) of the systematic error (Σ) and the root mean square of the random error (σ). Margins were calculated using the formula by Stroom et al. [Int. J. Radiat. Oncol., Biol., Phys. 43 (4), 905 – 919 (1999) ]: 2 Σ+ 0. 7 σ. The resultant calculations for implanted fiducial motion traces (all values in cm) show that M and Σ are negligible for moving average algorithm, moving average gating, and real-time tracking (i. e., M and Σ= 0 cm) compared to static beam (M= 0. 02 cm and Σ= 0. 16 cm) or <b>gated</b> <b>beam</b> delivery (M=− 0. 05 and 0. 16 cm at both exhale and inhale, respectively, and Σ= 0. 17 and 0. 26 cm at both exhale and inhale, respectively). Moving average algorithm σ= 0. 22 cm has a slightly lower random error than static beam delivery σ= 0. 24 cm, though gating, moving average gating, and real-time tracking have much lower random error values for implanted fiducial motion. Similar trends were also observed for the results using the external respiratory motion data. Moving average algorithm delivery significantly reduces M and Σ compared with static beam delivery. The moving average algorithm removes the nonstationary part of the respiration motion which is also achieved by AV, and thus the addition of the moving average algorithm shows little improvement with AV. Overall, a moving average algorithm shows margin reduction compared with <b>gating</b> and static <b>beam</b> delivery, and may have some mechanical advantages over real-time tracking when the beam is aligned with the target and patient compliance advantages over real-time tracking when the target is aligned to the beam...|$|R

In this paper, we calculate the strengths of beam current and velocity modulation produced in a gridded electron gun, and show that under normal conditions the initial modulation is dominated by density variation rather than velocity variation...|$|R
