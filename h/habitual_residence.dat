They had a reservation in a bed and breakfast at Twyford Crescent, Acton, where they lived until 1 May 1999, when they moved to Nicoll Road, Harlesden, in the London Borough of Brent. On 25 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited Esther Ackah, a distant relative of Kouao by marriage, and a midwife, counsellor and preacher. Ackah and her daughter noted that Climbié was wearing a wig and looked small and frail. On 26 April 1999, Kouao and Climbié visited the Homeless Persons' Unit of Ealing Council, where they were seen by Julie Winter, a homeless persons' officer. Together, Kouao and Winter completed a housing application form. Kouao explained that Climbié was wearing a wig because she had short hair, an explanation accepted by Winter. Although Winter was shown Climbié's passport (with a photograph of Anna), she {{paid no attention to}} them, believing that Kouao's application was ineligible on the grounds of <b>habitual</b> <b>residence.</b> Winter confirmed her decision with her duty senior and told Kouao that she was not eligible for housing. She telephoned the referral across to Pamela Fortune, a social worker in Ealing's Acton referral and assessment team. She did not produce a written or electronic documentation of the referral, however, something which would have helped in double-checking the accounts that Kouao gave.|$|E

Difficult questions arise on whether an adopted child may marry his or her adoptive parents, or the natural children of the adoptive parents. No matter what legislative decisions are taken, there will always be citizens who wish to evade the application of the law.

30|$|The term ‘children on the move’ {{is not a}} new one. Its meaning, however, {{has changed}} over decades, and only in recent years has it become wholly {{associated}} with migrant children of all categories. Early usage of the term ‘children on the move’ comes across as more of a rhetorical attempt at presenting elegant niceties rather than one aimed at defining and establishing a specific term. Dottridge claims that the term began to be used around 2005 ‘to refer generically to children who had left their <b>habitual</b> place of <b>residence</b> to move either within their own country or to another country’ (Dottridge 2012, p. 21). From then on, definitions started to emerge from different organisations, all of them focussing on child migration. By 2008, Save the Children had already begun using ‘children on the move’ as a term widely referring to migrant children (Reale 2008). As with most other sectors, however, defining terms in this field is not an easy task. Echoing the reflections made earlier in this research about the malleability of the concept of childhood, Delaney concedes that the field is dominated by specialist words and concepts that ‘can mean different things in different places (within countries or even within organisations) or their meaning is not always clear’ (Delaney 2012, p. 4).|$|R

50|$|The {{novel is}} narrated from the {{perspective}} of Annie, an eight-year-old child living in 'Kokkanchira'. 'Kokkanchira' is depicted as an undesirable place. Annie's school teachers are also shown chiding children from 'Kokkanchira' and showing general apathy and disgust. 'Kokkkanchira' is described as being a dumping ground for carcasses and dead bodies, before Annie and her family moved in there. 'Kokkanchira' is now inhabited by lowest of classes in the society. They are generally shown as people who are latrine cleaners, scavengers and belonging to dalit groups or other marginalized group of people that are shunned by higher class society. However Joseph also points out that the city of Thrissur needs the services of these groups even when the existential rights of these groups remain unacknowledged. The main theme of the novel is the displacement faced by such groups of people in the name of urbanization and development. Being from the lowest stratum, these people are easily moved from their <b>habitual</b> places of <b>residences</b> by the rich and become increasingly isolated in the middle of new pavements and multi-storied houses. Annie is witness to these changes taking place around her, in 'Kodichiangadi' and 'Kokkanchira'. She describes these changes affecting her and her family through her childlike eyes and perspective. Hence it is with childlike simplicity that she observes the demolition of a stretch of single-roomed houses {{to make way for a}} bungalow and the rise of a convent near to her own home, in a plot that used to be vacant.|$|R
40|$|ResumenEl proceso de envejecimiento de la población iniciado en el último tercio del siglo XX en los países más desarrollados, se está extendiendo al resto del mundo en el siglo XXI, coincidiendo con la creciente urbanización del planeta que afecta igualmente a todos los territorios, aunque con diferencias patentes entre los países más y menos desarrollados. En este trabajo se revisan las interacciones de envejecimiento y urbanización y algunas de sus implicaciones en la sociedad. Se centra en la situación actualde las personas mayores que cada vez suponen más altas proporciones de la población de cada país y que afrontan grandes dificultades en su día a día, derivadas de sus limitaciones personales, a las que se añaden las múltiples barreras urbanas de unas ciudades pensadas para la población joven y sana. AbstractPopulation ageing and {{urbanization}} are two global {{trends that}} together comprise major forces shaping the 21 st century. At {{the same time}} as cities are growing, their share of residents aged 65 years and more is increasing. The world is currently experiencing two major demographic transitions: the ageing of populations and urbanization. The trend in today's planetary human society is restructuring throughout two fundamental and simultaneous processes with serious socio-economic implications. The urban environment influences the health and quality of older people's life. By 2050, {{more than two-thirds of the}} world's population will be living in cities. And, at least, a quarter of urban populations will be aged 65 and over, with significant implications for urban planning and development. Increasingly, cities will need to balance their role as drivers of economic development with responsibilities for improving the quality life of elderly people. In 2015, worldwide, 8 percent of the population is over 65 years and in the most developed and urbanized countries the percentage raises to 17 percent. Between 1950 and 2015, the total world population increased by 191 percent. However, in the same period, the population of older people rose by a much larger proportion. Between 1950 and 2000 the proportion of those over 65 grew by 218 percent and the population of people aged 80 or more by 386 percent. In the last fifteen years this process has intensified even more. Currently, developed countries have the greatest proportion of elders, but in a few decades many developing countries will reach the same levels of aging. In 2015 the percentage in Latin America reached 7 percent while in the European Union it is 19 percent. In an attempt to diversify the long interval between the onset of aging and increasingly advanced centenarian ages, for testing purposes, this broad age group has been disaggregated into three subgroups: young old (65 - 74 years), old old (75 - 84 years) and very old (over 85 years). These subgroups show a relatively greater internal homogeneity, considering both patterns of biological clock and, above all, the social clock indicating the changes that occur in both economic activity and capabilities intellectual, cognitive, health, life expectancy [...] . The ageing population, a process registered not only in all developed countries, is due to the reduction tendency of birth and fertility and at the same time, to the decreasing of mortality and an important extension of the life expectancy at birth. Population ageing is not “gender-neutral”. The evolution to an older age structure changes the balance in numbers of men and women in the whole population. Men's higher mortality over the life course means that women typically outnumber men at older ages, and the difference is quite large among the oldest old. We must take into account that older people have a gradual loss of physical and mental faculties that they previously had. This process is the first cause of the transition generally to less mobility and repetitive spatial behaviors that are dominated by a certain rejection to change, especially to change the <b>habitual</b> place of <b>residence.</b> In general, older people want to stay at home, but his progressive loss of health and personal autonomy generates serious problems for families who must deal with their care. Not so long ago, the relatives have always been the people who had assumed the care of the elderly in their own homes, often because women were made usually responsible for reproductive work. However, due to the incorporation of women into the workplace and the increasing number of long-lived people, many women refuse to give up their jobs to care for their grandparents or parents. At present, older people in situations of dependency have to realize that informal care is no longer an option due to changes in traditional family values. However, in the current economic crisis, seniors are sometimes the ones aiding their economically uncertain families. This happens in those countries being hardest hit by the economic crisis. In general, society tends to convey a negative image of older people associated with dependence and vulnerability, regardless of the diversity of situations that arise in this heterogeneous age group, ignoring the positive aspects of aging as is the accumulated experience. And this is accentuated in urban areas that are not designed for the needs of this age group, especially the most dependent. Urbanists, planners and managers of city governments should be aware that any transformation of urban spaces entails territorial identities and sense of place of older people...|$|R

2500|$|The 1961 Convention {{brought an}} {{innovation}} in terminology {{by creating a}} compromise between advocates of [...] "nationality" [...] as the determining factor for jurisdiction and advocates for the modern fact-centric model of [...] "habitual residence." [...] It also included expanded language to encompass both judicial and administrative authorities {{in response to the}} Boll case, in which Sweden claimed its public administrative law was exempt from the 1902 Convention on the Guardianship of minors because it only governed domestic private judicial law and not public administrative law. The 1961 Convention also emphasized the concept of the [...] "interests of the child" [...] as a basis for authorities of the child's nationality to overrule the authorities of the child's <b>habitual</b> <b>residence.</b> Of particularly special note, the drafters of the 1961 Convention expressly considered a provision addressing the removal of a child from their <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> with an intent to evade rightful jurisdiction—primarily for child custody reasons. This first attempt to codify international child abduction failed due to an inability to agree on a definition or manner of describing the phenomenon, with a number of countries that adhered to the principle of nationality regulating personal child and family law unable to classify their nationals removing children from foreign countries to their home state as fraudulent evasion.|$|E
2500|$|Between parties, {{children}} who were abducted are required to {{be sent back to}} their [...] "habitual residence" [...] after the abduction takes place.

The Convention does not demand that any country recognize the ruling of a family court in other countries, {{which is part of the}} Hague Protection of Children Convention.

2500|$|Merle H. Weiner in the Fordham Law Review {{pointed out}} that there was {{widespread}} media attention in the US during the late 1970s and early 1980s about international child abduction where the typical abductor was a foreign non-custodial male who abducted children from their primary caregiver. According to Weiner, this stereotype dominated the U.S. Congressional proceeding for ratification and resulted in a presumption in the US that abduction is always harmful to children. The Hague Convention makes no mention of domestic violence as a defense. Due to the focus on promoting return of children to their <b>habitual</b> <b>residence,</b> [...] "the domestic violence victim's ability to defeat a Hague Convention application for the return of their child, if possible at all, often turns more on fortuity and the judge's sympathy than on any principled rule of law." [...] The Australian delegate to the Hague Convention commission stated that: There is concern that the Convention is now being used by abusive (usually male) parents to seek the return of children and primary carers back to the country of <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> and that the Convention is moving away from what it was meant to deter. Recent statistics demonstrate that the majority of abducting parents are women, often those fleeing situation of abuse and domestic violence. There is also growing concerns regarding the correlation between incidents of child abduction and the presence of domestic violence and that the Convention does not give due consideration and sufficient weight to such mitigating circumstances {{in the context of a}} [...] "grave risk" [...] argument.|$|E
2500|$|The United States is {{obliged to}} {{recognize}} valid claims for asylum under the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees and its 1967 Protocol. As defined by these agreements, a refugee {{is a person who}} is outside his or her country of nationality (or place of <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> if stateless) who, owing to a fear of persecution on account of a protected ground, is unable or unwilling to avail himself of the protection of the state. Protected grounds include race, nationality, religion, political opinion and membership of a particular social group. The signatories to these agreements are further obliged not to return or [...] "refoul" [...] refugees to the place where they would face persecution.|$|E
2500|$|Following World War II and in {{response}} to the large numbers of people fleeing Eastern Europe, the UN 1951 Refugee Convention adopted (in Article 1.A.2) the following definition of [...] "refugee" [...] to apply to any person who: [...] "owing to well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion, is outside the country of his nationality and is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to avail himself of the protection of that country; or who, not having a nationality and being outside the country of his former <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> as a result of such events, is unable or, owing to such fear, is unwilling to return to it." ...|$|E
2500|$|Another {{systemic}} {{problem is}} the apparent {{lack of understanding of}} the Convention’s purpose and intent by many judges. The Convention was not designed to address underlying custody issues. Those were meant to be dealt with by the courts in the country of the child's <b>habitual</b> <b>residence,</b> after the child has been returned. However, as noted above, the lack of implementing legislation has allowed judges to apply Mexican procedural and custody law in Hague cases to deny return when the only issues the court is supposed to examine are: (a) whether the child was [...] "habitually resident" [...] in another Hague state prior to the abduction or illegal retention; (b) whether the left-behind parent had some form of custodial rights at the time; and (c) whether those rights were being exercised.|$|E
2500|$|It {{was later}} {{revealed}} {{that with the}} help of an accomplice, Bryan Wickham, [...] he had taken them by car to Weipa in Australia's far north, and by boat from the Cape York Peninsula to Merauke, in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya. From there he took them to Malaysia via Sulawesi, where the authorities retrospectively awarded him custody, and the children were then settled with their father in Terengganu. Wickham spent one year planning the abduction, arranging vehicles and a boat, studying the escape route. Wickham later served nine months in an Australian jail for his part. Malaysia is not a party to the Hague Convention, which recognises custody by the <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> of minor children, and so the Convention could not be used to return the children to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{there are}} states in Mexico where judges {{have a better}} {{understanding}} of the Convention and have ordered returns under the Convention, the USCA continues to note an overall pattern of noncompliance in Mexico’s judicial system. In the few cases that led to the return of the child to the United States, the LBP retained a private attorney with a greater understanding of the Convention’s principles than Mexican public prosecutors have tended to exhibit. Mexican courts delay Convention cases and often improperly treat them as custody decisions. See Convention, art. 16. In these instances, Mexican judges determine children to be well settled in the new environment and deny the application for return to the child’s country of <b>habitual</b> <b>residence.</b> This determination could be avoided by handling Convention cases more expeditiously and adhering more closely to the Convention’s requirements. Mexican judges have also abused the [...] "amparo", a special type of constitutional challenge, which results in additional delays to Convention cases and increases the LBP’s legal costs.|$|E
2500|$|The term {{international}} {{child abduction}} is generally synonymous with international parental kidnapping, child snatching, and child stealing. [...] However, the more precise legal usage of {{international child abduction}} originates in private international law and refers to the illegal removal of children from their home by an acquaintance or family member to a foreign country. In this context, [...] "illegal" [...] is normally taken to mean [...] "in breach of custodial rights" [...] and [...] "home" [...] {{is defined as the}} child's <b>habitual</b> <b>residence.</b> As implied by the [...] "breach of custodial rights," [...] the phenomenon of international child abduction generally involves an illegal removal that creates a jurisdictional conflict of laws whereby multiple authorities and jurisdictions could conceivably arrive at seemingly reasonable and conflicting custodial decisions with geographically limited application. Such a result often strongly affects a child's access and connection to half their family and may cause the loss of their former language, culture, name and nationality, it violates numerous children's rights, and can cause severe psychological and emotional trauma to the child and family left behind.|$|E
2500|$|... "it {{would seem}} {{necessary}} to underline {{the fact that}} the three types of exception to the rule concerning the return of the child must be applied only so far as they go and no further. This implies above all that they are to be interpreted in a restrictive fashion if the Convention is not to become a dead letter. In fact, the Convention as a whole rests upon the unanimous rejection of this phenomenon of illegal child removals and upon the conviction {{that the best way to}} combat them at an international level is to refuse to grant them legal recognition. The practical application of this principle requires that the signatory States be convinced that they belong, despite their differences, to the same legal community within which the authorities of each State acknowledge that the authorities of one of them – those of the child's <b>habitual</b> <b>residence</b> – are in principle best placed to decide upon questions of custody and access. As a result, a systematic invocation of the said exceptions, substituting the forum chosen by the abductor for that of the child's residence, would lead to the collapse of the whole structure of the Convention by depriving it of the spirit of mutual confidence which is its inspiration." ...|$|E
