40|$|Very large {{collisions}} in {{the asteroid}} belt could lead temporarily to {{a substantial increase in}} the rate of impacts of meteorites on Earth. Orbital simulations predict that fragments from such events may arrive considerably faster than the typical transit times of meteorites falling today, because in some large impacts part of the debris is transferred directly into a resonant orbit with Jupiter. Such an efficient meteorite <b>delivery</b> <b>track,</b> however, has not been verified. Here we report high-sensitivity measurements of noble gases produced by cosmic rays in chromite grains from a unique suite of fossil meteorites preserved in approximately 480 million year old sediments. The transfer times deduced from the noble gases are as short as approximately 10 (5) years, and they increase with stratigraphic height in agreement with the estimated duration of sedimentation. These data provide powerful evidence that this unusual meteorite occurrence {{was the result of a}} long-lasting rain of meteorites following the destruction of an asteroid, and show that at least one strong resonance in the main asteroid belt can deliver material into the inner Solar System within the short timescales suggested by dynamical models...|$|E

40|$|Abstract — As the Web is {{becoming}} a communication and collaboration platform, there is an acute need for an infrastructure to disseminate real-time events over the Web. However, such infrastructure is still seriously lacking as conventional distributed event-based systems are not designed for the Web. To address this issue, we develop a RESTful web service framework, R-Event. It represents and encapsulates the structural elements of Event-Driven Architecture (EDA) into the infrastructure of REST (Representational State Transfer), the architectural style that underlies the Web. Our approach leads to an event-driven web consisting of 4 layers of RESTful web services. The R-Event framework implements the layers that are pivotal to the event-driven web. The core component of this framework is federated topic hubs that provide services for notification publication, subscription, <b>delivery,</b> <b>tracking,</b> and linking. The advantages and applications of this approach are presented and discussed, including the important features of addressability, connectedness, dynamic topology, robustness, scalability, and efficient notifications. A prototype system for presence driven collaboration is developed and the preliminary performance tests show that the proposed approach is feasible and advantageous...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{considered}} {{the use of}} ultrasound-based image guidance systems, employed to account for internal motion of the prostate gland during radiotherapy. A clinical evaluation of the Clarity soft tissue visualisation system, employed at Galway University Hospital during patient set-up, was performed based on a retrospective statistical analysis of clinically obtained prostate motion data.

The Autoscan ultrasound probe, which is clinically employed at the Institute of Cancer Research, London, UK, was also considered in this work. This probe remains in place during treatment <b>delivery,</b> <b>tracking</b> the prostate in real-time. Characterisation of the effect of the probe on the local dose distribution was performed, by Monte Carlo means, which {{have been shown to be}} the most accurate method of modelling absorbed dose. To achieve this aim, an accurate Monte Carlo model of a clinical linear accelerator was developed (agreeing with measurement within a clinically acceptable level).

40|$|The ever {{increasing}} death of patients affected by {{various types of}} fatal cancers is of concern worldwide. Curative attempts by radiation/chemotherapy and surgery are often a failure in the long run. Moreover, adverse side effects of such treatments burden the patients with painful survival at the last phase of their life. The failure of early diagnosis {{is one of the}} root causes of the problem. Intensive research activities are being pursued in reputed laboratories across the globe to find superior diagnostics and therapeutics. Over the last decade, a number of publications have highlighted RNA interference based silencing of cancer-related gene expression as a promising technology to tackle the aforesaid problems. Superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) are reported to be excellent vehicles for short-interfering RNA (siRNA). The SPION-siRNA conjugate is biocompatible, stable, and amenable to specific targeting and can cross the blood brain barrier. The issues related to their synthesis, surface properties, <b>delivery,</b> <b>tracking,</b> imaging in relevance to cancer diagnostic and therapeutic, and so forth demand an extensive review, and we have addressed these aspects in this paper. The future prospects of the technology have also been traced...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT RNAi is a {{powerful}} tool for target identifi cation and can lead to novel therapies for pharmacologically intractable targets such as KRAS. RNAi therapy must com-bine potent siRNA payloads with reliable in vivo delivery for effi cient target inhibition. We used a func-tional “Sensor ” assay to establish a library of potent siRNAs against RAS pathway genes and to show that they effi ciently suppress their targets at low dose. This reduces off-target effects and enables combination gene knockdown. We administered Sensor siRNAs in vitro and in vivo and validated the delivery of KRAS siRNA alone and siRNA targeting the complete RAF effector node (A/B/CRAF) as promising strategies to treat KRAS-mutant colorectal cancer. We further demonstrate that improved therapeutic effi cacy is achieved by formulating siRNA payloads that combine both single-gene siRNA and node-targeted siRNAs (KRAS + PIK 3 CA/B). The customizable nature of Sensor siRNA payloads offers a universal platform for the combination target identifi cation and development of RNAi therapeutics. SIGNIFICANCE: To advance RNAi therapy for KRAS-mutant cancer, we developed a validated siRNA library against RAS pathway genes that enables combination gene silencing. Using an in vivo model for real-time siRNA <b>delivery</b> <b>tracking,</b> we show that siRNA-mediated inhibition of KRAS as well as RAF o...|$|R
40|$|The Transfusion Medicine Service (TMS) covers diverse {{clinical}} and laboratory-based services {{that must be}} delivered with accuracy, efficiency and reliability. TMS oversight is shared by multiple regulatory agencies that cover product manufacturing and validation standards geared toward patient safety. These demands present significant informatics challenges. Over the past few decades, TMS information systems have improved to better handle blood product manufacturing, inventory, <b>delivery,</b> <b>tracking</b> and documentation. Audit trails and access to electronic databases have greatly facilitated product traceability and biovigilance efforts. Modern blood bank computing has enabled novel applications such as the electronic crossmatch, kiosk-based blood product delivery systems, and self-administered computerized blood donor interview and eligibility determination. With increasing use of barcoding technology, {{there has been a}} marked improvement in patient and specimen identification. Moreover, the emergence of national and international labeling standards such as ISBT 128 have facilitated the availability, movement and tracking of blood products across national and international boundaries. TMS has only recently begun to leverage the electronic medical record to address quality issues in transfusion practice and promote standardized documentation within institutions. With improved technology, future growth is expected in blood bank automation and product labeling with applications such as radio frequency identification devices.

40|$|International audienceThe {{challenge}} in prostate cancer radiotherapy is {{to deliver the}} planned dose to the prostate, sparing {{as much as possible}} the neighboring organs, namely bladder and rectum. If a lower amount of dose, compared to the prescription, is delivered to the prostate, the risk of failure may increase. Likewise, if higher doses are delivered to the neighboring organs, undesirable side effects may occur. Accurate localization of prostate and organs at risk is therefore a bottleneck in radiotherapy. In recent Image Guided Radiotherapy (IGRT) procedures, an intra-operative Cone Beam CT (CBCT) is used at each session to align the prostate to the planned CT and to maximize the correct dose <b>delivery.</b> <b>Tracking</b> the prostate in these images may allow not only to achieve this goal but also to accurately measure the cumulated dose as the session goes. This work introduces a new method that automatically locates the prostate in CBCT images. The whole method lies in a Bayesian formulation where a multiscale image representation, the local jets, is used as a likelihood function, an the prior knowledge is learned from multiple examples by expert manual delineations. Compared with manual ground truth segmentations, the results showed a Jaccard similarity index of 0. 84, and an accuracy of 98 %in a set of 4 studies of four patients...|$|R
