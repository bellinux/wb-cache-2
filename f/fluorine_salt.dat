Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Tritium is an essential component of thermonuclear weapons in the US arsenal. Unfortunately, tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, and one-half of the inventory disappears through radioactive decay every 12 years; therefore, it must be replenished. Until a few years ago, the only way to accomplish the tritium production mission was to use fission reactors. Recently, thanks to the development of new accelerator technologies (SDI and SSC studies) and to the post cold war era (international treaties limiting the number of warheads and therefore the tritium requirements), accelerator-based production of tritium seems feasible and is being investigated. The production of tritium using accelerators is a two step process: the production of neutrons in the 'target' and the use of these neutrons in the 'blanket assembly'. The systems described in this thesis employ a linear accelerator (1 GeV protons, I 00 mA beam current), lead targets for the production of neutrons via spallation reactions, and tritium breeding regions (blankets containing ' 6 Li in various mixtures). The high energy interactions and the particle transport were modeled with the LAHET computer code system. Heterogeneous and homogeneous spallation target/blanket systems were investigated. The target designs in the heterogeneous systems were 1 / liquid lead, and 2 / layers of solid lead plates cooled by heavy water. The tritium breeding blanket assemblies contained either lithium oxide or molten <b>fluorine</b> <b>salt</b> with or without UF 4 ' The tritium production rates achieved were- 1 5 tritium atoms per incident proton for the L' 20 blanket,- 1 6 tritium atoms per incident proton for the LiF BeF 2 ZrF 4 blanket, and- 215 tritium atoms per incident proton for the LiF BeF 2 ZrF 4 UF 4 blanket. An homogeneous target/blanket system consisting of molten lithium lead eutectic (L', 7 Pb 83) was also considered.

Secondly, several construction solutions have been assessed and project documentation has been created for some of them. These designs include alternative shapes of valves and canals, where heat exchanging medium flows – Field tube and valve with helix canal. These concepts allow fast intake (conducting away) of heat into the working fluid and after verification on an experimental stand these valves could work in conditions of nuclear facilities.

40|$|The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) site {{is located}} in Tennessee, on the U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation (ORR), south of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) main plant across Haw Ridge in Melton Valley. The MSRE was run by ORNL to {{demonstrate}} the desirable features of the molten-salt concept in a practical reactor that could be operated safely and reliably. It introduced {{the idea of a}} homogeneous reactor using fuel salt media and graphite moderation for power and breeder reactors. The MSRE reactor and associated components are located in cells beneath the floor in the high-bay area of Building 7503 (Figure 1). The reactor was operated from June 1965 to December 1969. When the reactor was shut down, fuel salt was drained from the reactor circuit to two drain tanks. A ''clean'' salt was then circulated through the reactor as a decontamination measure and drained to a third drain tank. When operations ceased, the fuel and flush salts were allowed t o cool and solidify in the drain tanks. At shutdown, the MSRE facility complex was placed in a surveillance and maintenance program. As a result of the S&M program, it was discovered in 1994 that gaseous uranium (233 U/ 232 U) hexafluoride (UF 6) had moved throughout the MSRE process systems. The UF 6 was generated when radiolysis of the <b>fluorine</b> <b>salts</b> caused the individual constituents to dissociate to their component atoms, including free fluorine. Some of the free fluorine combined with uranium fluorides (UF 4) in the salt to form UF 6. UF 6 is gaseous at slightly above ambient temperatures; thus, periodic heating of the fuel salts (which was intended to remedy the radiolysis problems) and simple diffusion had allowed the UF 6 {{to move out of the}} salt and into the process systems of MSRE...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a preliminary criticality safety study of some potential effects of uranium reduction and aggregation in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) fuel drain tanks (FDTs) during salt removal operations. Since the salt was transferred to the FDTs in 1969, radiological and chemical reactions have been converting the uranium and <b>fluorine</b> in the <b>salt</b> to UF{sub 6 } and free fluorine. Significant amounts of uranium (at least 3 kg) and fluorine have migrated out of the FDTs and into the off-gas system (OGS) and the auxiliary charcoal bed (ACB). The loss of uranium and <b>fluorine</b> from the <b>salt</b> changes the chemical properties of the salt sufficiently to possibly allow the reduction of the UF{sub 4 } in the salt to uranium metal as the salt is remelted prior to removal. It has been postulated that up to 9 kg of the maximum 19. 4 kg of uranium in one FDT could be reduced to metal and concentrated. This study shows that criticality becomes a concern when more than 5 kg of uranium concentrates to over 8 wt% of the salt in a favorable geometry...|$|R

According to the Gen IV philosophy for closed cycle nuclear reactor, the actinides are sent back in the reactor core. In this way, the wastes radiotoxicity is strongly decreased and the use of natural resource is optimized.

5000|$|After {{shutdown}} {{the salt}} {{was believed to}} be in long-term safe storage. At low temperatures, radiolysis can free <b>fluorine</b> from the <b>salt.</b> As a countermeasure the salt was annually reheated to about 150 °C, until 1989.But beginning in the mid-1980s, there was concern that radioactivity was migrating through the system. Sampling in 1994 revealed concentrations of uranium that created a potential for a nuclear criticality accident, as well as a potentially dangerous build-up of fluorine gas — the environment above the solidified salt was approximately one atmosphere of fluorine. The ensuing decontamination and decommissioning project was called [...] "the most technically challenging" [...] activity assigned to Bechtel Jacobs under its environmental management contract with the U.S. Department of Energy's Oak Ridge Operations organization. In 2003, the MSRE cleanup project was estimated at about $130 million, with decommissioning expected to be completed in 2009.Removal of uranium from the salt was finally complete in March 2008, however still leaving the salt with the fission products in the tanks.|$|R
40|$|AbstractSeveral {{types of}} health {{problems}} in Jhajjar district of Haryana state are prevailing owing to groundwater quality problems such as high concentration of fluoride, chloride, salinity, TDS, etc. The objective of this work {{was to assess the}} overall groundwater quality of the district based on Water Quality Index (WQI), and find out the factors leading to continuous deterioration in groundwater quality. The study demonstrates that groundwater quality of Jhajjar district is totally unsuitable for drinking purposes and is directly or indirectly influenced by geogenic factors. About 60 – 70 % of the samples analysed show high fluoride content. Other parameters such as hardness, electrical conductivity, Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), and Chloride are also above the permissible limits. Hydrogeologically the study area belongs to Indo-Gangetic alluvial plains, which are dominated by clay-silt, clay and grey micaceous sand formations. Clay rich formations are rich in <b>fluorine</b> and other <b>salts</b> and their weathering is most probably causing the continuous escalation in the fluoride and salinity concentration in groundwater.

40|$|Rechargeable lithium-based {{battery is}} one of the most {{promising}} battery candidates for high energy storage devices. Batteries containing lithium metal, eschewed the use of carbon supporting materials can lead to as much as a ten-fold improvement in anode storage capacity from 360 mAh g- 1 to 3860 mAh g- 1 and would open up opportunities for high energy un-lithiated cathode materials such as sulfur and oxygen, among others. Unfortunately, significant improvements in safe and stable battery performance are needed due to the non-uniform lithium deposition on the negative electrode. These uneven dendritic structures increase the potential risk of cell short-circuiting, energy fading or even fire hazards. Recent discoveries and advances have focused on electrolyte reconfigurations for the sake of suppressing or even eliminating dendrite formation. Of the various options, ionic liquids offer multiple synergetic properties that make them attractive electrolytes for extending lifetime and safety of LMBs. Their inherently low vapor pressure, non-flammability, good electrochemical stability in the presence of metallic lithium make ILs excellent choice in fail-safe LMBs. When anchored to metal oxide nanoparticle surface, it promotes the mechanical strength as well as maintaining the advantages of ILs. This dissertation researches ionic liquid-tethered hybrid nanoparticle electrolytes with several goals: improving room temperature ionic conductivity of the electrolytes while maintaining chemical and mechanical stabilities, improving lithium-ion transference number, and studying the dendritic lithium metal growth as a function of electrolyte properties. It is found that all types of IL electrolytes show improvements over the conventional electrolytes such as propylene carbonate in LiTFSI. It also found that untethered IL has comparable cell lifetime to tethered IL and piperidinium-based IL suppresses dendrite growth more efficiently than imidazolium-based IL. Later in this dissertation, we discussed the efforts of extending the cell lifetime beyond ionic 3 liquid platform.

40|$|Photocuring of {{epoxides}} proceeds by a cationic mechanism. The required photoinitiators are iodonium or sulfonium salts with non-nucleophilic anions. The {{influence of}} different photoinitiators on the adhesion properties {{of both a}} rigid and a soft epoxide is examined. Depending on the substrates to be joined, different decomposition products of the initiators are concentrated in the interphase. This accumulation of decomposition products in the interphase leads to a decreased adhesion. On gold surfaces the sulfur of sulfonium salts is concentrated as expected. But surprisingly the iodine of the iodonium salts is also concentrated on gold. It could be shown by immobilization experiments that organic iodine compounds with the iodine in any oxidation state reacted with gold surfaces. Due to this reaction iodide anions are formed. On silicon surfaces the fluorine of the anions PF 6 - and SbF 6 - is concentrated due to the high affinity of silicon for <b>fluorine.</b> The iodonium <b>salt</b> with [B(C 6 F 5) (4) ](-) anion contains no fluorine able to react with the silicon.

40|$|Lithium ion {{batteries}} {{are widely used}} as energy storage devices {{in a variety of}} products such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and other portable electronics. Thanks to their high energy density and cyclability, they are currently being used by and developed for electric vehicles. There is a growing need for cost reduction; increase in energy density; wider operating temperature range; and improved safety characteristics of the batteries. Organic carbonates are the primary solvents used in lithium-ion battery electrolytes along with electrolyte additives. The reversibility of current lithium-ion batteries is dependent upon the electrolyte used in the batteries. During the initial charging cycles of the cell, a solid electrolyte interface (SEI) is formed by reduction of organic carbonates, electrolyte salts and/or electrolyte additives {{on the surface of the}} graphitic anode in lithium-ion batteries. The generation of a stable anode SEI prevents continuous electrolyte reduction on the surface of the anode. The SEI functions as a Li ion conductor but an electrical insulator. The reduction reactions of the electrolytes on the graphitic anode surface have been investigated for many years and it been proposed to contain a complicated mixture of products including lithium oxalate, lithium alkoxides, and lithium oxide from the carbonate solvents and LiF and lithium fluorophosphates from the reduction of LiPF 6. Similar ambiguity exists about the components of SEI formed from electrolyte additives and other electrolyte salts. Despite the extensive investigations, the structure, formation mechanisms and evolution of the SEI are poorly understood. Understanding the mechanisms of the reduction reactions of organic carbonates, electrolyte salts and electrolyte additives along with the products of the reactions which result in the generation of the SEI is essential for the development of safer lithium-ion batteries with wider operating temperature range. Lithium naphthalenide has been investigated as a one electron reducing agent for organic carbonates solvents, some of the most robust additives and salts used in lithium ion battery electrolytes. The reaction precipitates have been analyzed by IR-ATR, XPS and solution NMR spectroscopy. The evolved gases and the volatile components have been analyzed by GC-MS. The reduction products of ethylene carbonate and propylene carbonate are lithium ethylene dicarbonate (LEDC) and ethylene and lithium propylene dicarbonate (LPDC) and propylene, respectively. The reduction products of diethyl and dimethyl carbonate are lithium ethyl carbonate (LEC) and ethane and lithium methyl carbonate(LMC) and methane, respectively. Electrolyte additives, FEC and VC reductively decompose to HCO 2 Li, Li 2 C 2 O 4, Li 2 CO 3, and polymerized VC. All the <b>fluorine</b> containing <b>salts</b> generate LiF upon reduction. In addition to LiF, LiBF 4 generates LixByFz species; LiBOB and LiDFOB generate lithium oxalate and boron-oxalatoesters; LiPF 6 yields LiPF 2 species and LiTFSI produces lithium bis[N-(trifluoromethylsulfonylimino) ] trifluoromethanesulfonate. The poor thermal stability of the SEI layer has been attributed to exothermic reactions between lithium alkyl carbonates and LiPF 6. While the relationship between capacity fade and SEI instability is clear, and there have been some investigations of SEI component evolution, the mechanism of SEI component decomposition is complicated by the presence of many different components. The thermal stability of Li 2 CO 3, LMC, and LEDC in the presence of LiPF 6 in dimethyl carbonate (DMC), a common salt and solvent, respectively, in lithium ion battery electrolytes, has been investigated to afford a better understanding of the evolution of the SEI. The residual solids from the reaction mixtures have been characterized by a combination of X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) and infrared spectroscopy with attenuated total reflectance (IR-ATR), while the solution and evolved gases have been investigated by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and gas chromatography with mass selective detection (GC-MS). The thermal decomposition of Li 2 CO 3 and LiPF 6 in DMC yields CO 2, LiF, and F 2 PO 2 Li. The thermal decomposition of LMC and LEDC with LiPF 6 in DMC results in the generation of a complicated mixture including CO 2, LiF, ethers, phosphates, and fluorophosphates...|$|R
