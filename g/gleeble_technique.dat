40|$|A {{methodology}} of material characterisation and {{finite element model}} discretisation is presented for spot welded boron steel sheets, {{with the aim of}} predicting failure during quasi-static loading. The predicted load-displacement curves from the Finite Element model are compared with experimentally measured curves for lap-shear and cross-tension weld destructive geometries, and serve as model validation. During spot welding, the weld and surrounding material are exposed {{to a wide range of}} temperatures, from the melting point at the weld centre to room temperature in the base material. As a consequence, the weld exhibits varying microstructures with corresponding varying material properties which have a profound influence on its load bearing capacity and failure strength as a whole. In addition, boron steel spot welds exhibit unique hardness profiles, with high hardness values in the nugget and outlying base material, and a sudden drop in the area between these regions. This sudden decrease in material properties leads to further difficulties in modelling the failure of boron steel welds. The weld process inherently produces localised residual strains which also need to be accounted for in the model simulation, together with significant plastic strain redistributions resulting from the mechanical loading of the spot weld to its ultimate failure. The initial residual strains were measured in weld samples using neutron diffraction and were subsequently input into the FEA models. This thesis aims to quantify the varying material constitutive behaviour throughout the weld, required for the failure prediction. In particular, the following constitutive properties were extracted: the stress-strain response of certain weld regions, failure loci consisting of fracture strain versus stress state for the corresponding regions, and the residual stress distribution through the weld. Due to the small size of the weld, cutting test specimens directly from the weld is unachievable. To overcome this problem, specific weld and heat affected zone micro-structures were recreated onto practical tensile specimens through use of a Gleeble thermo-mechanical physical simulator. These specimens were subjected to the same thermal histories as specific points in the actual weld. From these tensile specimens, stress-strain curves relating to specific weld regions could be obtained. In a similar fashion, three additional destructive specimen sets were created to obtain failure loci. These failure loci give fracture strain as a function of stress state: specifically shear, uniaxial and plane-strain states. Due to the practical limitations in the accuracy of the <b>Gleeble</b> <b>technique,</b> deviations from the target microstructures were expected in the Gleeble samples. To gauge the extent of these deviations, a method of extracting reference material properties directly from the weld was required. Instrumented indentation offers such a solution, where the load and displacement of the indenter are measured and run through an algorithm to calculate the yield strength of the indented locations. These yield strengths are then compared with the yield from the Gleeble stress-strain curves to gauge the accuracy with which the weld microstructures were recreated. This technique serves to quantify the deviation of the Gleeble microstructures from the target material microstructures. It is common practice to discretise the weld into a small number of bulk regions during the design process, with material constitutive behaviour assigned to these discretised parts. In the new methodology, the extracted material constitutive behaviour is modelled as a continuously varying function of the distance from the weld centre. By performing appropriate interpolation, the data may be finely or roughly discretised. The data at a certain distance from the weld centre may then be assigned to the corresponding element in the finite element model. This means one may discretise the model by choosing the level of data interpolation refinement. The following results were observed in the thesis: • Residual strain distributions of boron steel spot welds, which have not been measured before, were presented. Clear correlations between hardness and residual stress distributions were seen. • A new application of instrumented indentation was attempted by verifying the accuracy of heat treated samples with respect to their target microstructures by comparing yield strengths. • The boron steel HAZ was characterised in a finer level of detail than seen in other literature works. • Through physical simulation, stress - strain and failure loci corresponding to certain HAZ areas were successfully extracted and used to model weld failure. • A new method of finite element model discretisation was presented, where material properties may be input as a relatively smooth function through the length of the model. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{stress-relief}} cracking susceptibility of single-pass welds {{in a new}} ferritic steel, HCM 2 S, {{has been}} evaluated and compared to 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel using <b>Gleeble</b> <b>techniques.</b> Simulated coarse-grained heat-affected zones (CGHAZ) were produced under a range of energy inputs and tested at various post-weld heat treatment (PWHT) temperatures. Both alloys were tested at a stress of 325 MPa. The 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel was also tested at 270 MPa to normalize for the difference in yield strength between the two materials. Light optical and scanning electron microscopy were used to characterize the CGHAZ microstructure. The ''as-welded'' CGHAZ of each alloy consisted of lath martensite or bainite and had approximately equal prior austenite grain sizes. The as-welded hardness of the 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel CGHAZ {{was significantly higher than}} that of the HCM 2 S alloy. Over the range studied energy input had no effect on the as-welded microstructure or hardness of either alloy. The energy input also had no effect on the stress-relief cracking susceptibility of either material. Both alloys failed intergranularly along prior austenite grain boundaries under all test conditions. The 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel samples experienced significant macroductility and some microductility when tested at 325 MPa. The ductility decreased significantly when tested at 270 MPa but was still higher that than of HCM 2 S at each test condition. The time to failure decreased with increasing PWHT Temperature for each material. There {{was no significant difference in}} the times to failure between the two materials. Varying energy input and stress had no effect on the time-to failure. The ductility, as measured by reduction in are% increased with increasing PWHT temperature for 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel tested at both stresses. However, PWHT temperature had no effect on the ductility of HCM 2 S. The hardness of the CGHAZ for 2. 25 Cr- 1 Mo steel decreased significantly after PWHT, but remained constant for HCM 2 S. The differences in stress-relief cracking response are discussed in terms of the differences in composition and expected carbide precipitation sequence for each alloy during PWHT...|$|R
40|$|This {{investigation}} {{is concerned with}} the characterisation of actual welded samples of P 91 - a 9 %Cr heat resisting steel that is widely used for pressure vessels in the power generation industry. Although the creep resistance of the normalised and tempered base steel is excellent, weld fabrication compromises creep performance because of degraded properties in the heat affected zone (HAZ). In order to elucidate the structure and properties of the HAZ, dilatometer heat treatments and simulations of HAZ sub-zones were carried out using both a dilatometer and a Gleeble thermo-mechanical simulator. The simulated samples were used to study the microstructure of the HAZ sub-zones and to subject them to creep testing. In actual welding, post weld heat treatment (PWHT) is used to produce a uniform tempered martensite structure across the weldment, making it difficult to distinguish the HAZ sub-zones and the boundary with the unaffected base plate. Nevertheless, hardness profiles across the HAZ and measurements within the sub-zones confirmed that softening occurs below the base plate hardness after PWHT in the intercritical (IC) and grain refined (GR) sub-zones. The creep fracture times of cross-weld creep samples were also lower than parent metal because of type IV fracture in these HAZ sub-zones. Dilatometric investigations shed new light on the sensitivity of the properties of the martensite to the thermal cycle associated with austenitisation and subsequent cooling. The AC 1 and AC 3 temperatures were increased with increasing heating rate and MS was lower for a lower heating rate. MS was found to vary from 420 °C to 370 °C and the hardness of the martensite from 365 to 480 HV, depending on the thermal cycle. This varialibilty is due to the extent of carbide solution. There was a marked increase in hardness with increasing peak temperature of the thermal cycle, but subsequent simulated PWHT substantially decreased the hardness and the hardness range of the simulated sub-zones. An excellent correlation was found between the structures and properties of the HAZ of the actual welds and the simulated sub-zones produced by both dilatometric and <b>Gleeble</b> <b>techniques.</b> It was established that the heat input (1. 6 or 2. 6 kJ/mm) had only a minor effect on the microstructure and hardness of Gleeble simulated sub-zone samples. TEM results confirmed the presence of coarse Cr-rich, M 23 C 6 and fine V-and Nb-rich, MC in all simulated sub-zones, before and after PWHT, except for the as simulated GCHAZ in which carbide solution occurred. Accelerated creep testing showed rapid creep failure of both AR and simulated IC and GR sub-zone samples for testing at higher temperatures in the range of 630 °C to 670 °C and at a higher stress, 100 MPa compared to 80 MPa. Failure was associated with high creep ductility and the phenomenon of rehardening in the region adjacent to the neck due to rapid work hardening prior to fracture. This type of failure has been labelled Mode 1 and is characterised structurally by grains and creep cavities that are strongly elongated parallel to the tensile axis. Another characteristic type of creep failure, Mode 2, exhibits a low creep ductility and transversely aligned creep cavities. This mode was found in notched AR samples and notched simulated GCHAZ samples tested at 630 °C and a stress at 80 MPa. However, for both Mode 1 and 2 failures, non-metallic inclusions were found to {{play a significant role in}} the nucleation of creep cracking and cavition. The research work identified that the GRHAZ is the most creep susceptible HAZ sub-zone because the thermal cycle results in carbide coarsening, reduced precipitation and solid solution strengthening and a high γ prior grain boundary surface area/unit volume. The creep resistance was most marked for the simulated GCHAZ samples and this property relates strongly to the hardness of the P 91 steel prior to creep testing. The important role of non-metallic inclusions in the nucleation of creep cracking and cavitation indicates that control of the type, size distribution and content of inclusions should have a significant effect on the creep life of P 91 steel...|$|R
