40|$|The {{paper is}} based on results {{obtained}} from topography of surfaces of sheets rolled from <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697, non-alloy low-carbon structural steel EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium. The presented results document correctness of {{the assumption that the}} rolling force Froll increases with the increasing reduction Δh {{and the quality of the}} rolled surface is improved at the simultaneous increasing of strength of rolled sheets and the decreasing of size of structural grains. The experiment was performed on the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa, which enables only non-continuous technology in contrast to the rolling mill with continuous reduction on one sheet in several degrees on rolling trains, in consequence of which the obtained height parameters of the section are in close correlation with the predicted dependence. Contribution of the work consists in the creation of a mathematical model (algorithm) for predicting technological parameters of the two-high rolling stand DUO 210 SVa at change of the absolute reduction Δh, for example for a <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697 and non-alloy lowcarbon structural steel PN EN 10263 - 2 : 2004 and aluminium, and also in the development of a method of calculation applicable to any material being rolled in general, because the authors have found that various materials can be differentiated by a derived analytical criterion IKP. This criterion is a function of ratio between the modulus of elasticity of reference material and that of actually rolled material. The reference material is here <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> of the type KOHAL grade 697. Verification was carried out by measuring changes of final surface roughness profile and final strength of rolled sheets of the stated materials in relation to reductions and those were compared with theoretically predicted values. It is possible to identify and predict on the basis of this algorithm an instant state of surface topography in respect to variable technological conditions. On this basis it is then possible to calculate and plot individual main technological parameters. Web of Science 14315114...|$|E

40|$|Since {{the second}} half of the past century, {{research}} in the automotive industry focused on vehicle performance, environmental compatibility, and safety improvement. Increasing interest about passive safety and the ever stricter regulations, both in the US and EU, pushed towards more reliable models of the vehicle behaviour and, to achieve this, to a deeper insight into material behaviour. For what concerns crash simulations, one of the most critical uncertainty relates to the influence of the loading speed on the material mechanical properties. This influence can be accounted by means of the strain-rate sensitivity that is substantial for most materials.

40|$|Steel {{producers}} {{are forced to}} reduce the production cost {{on the one hand}} and increase the performances of the products on the other hand, to maintain or even increase their market share. A likely method to save on production costs is to cut down the rather long production chain for conventional cold rolled strip, and to substitute certain cold rolled steel grades by hot rolled steel. Certainly this can rarely be achieved for exposed parts, requiring a perfect surface finish, whereas for unexposed parts, e. g. structural components, with lower surface requirements, the use of hot strips might be a cost saving alternative. The aim of this thesis is to contribute to the understanding of the microstructure and texture development of <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steels</b> during ferritic rolling, subsequent cold rolling and annealing {{on the one hand and}} to appraise the possible improvement of the mechanical and deep-drawing properties on the other hand. On the basis of these results guidelines for the industrial production of ferritic rolled hot strip are proposed. Furthermore, a new hot rolling strategy for the production of hot rolled low alloy TRIP steel is proposed and the development of the microstructure and the mechanical properties to be obtained are investigated in a set plain strain compression test using a hot deformation simulator.

40|$|The {{design of}} vehicle front {{structures}} for crashworthiness is nowadays commonly {{based on a}} series of rigid subsystems that constitute a nearly undeformable survival cell for the passengers, and deformable subsystems able to efficiently dissipate the vehicle kinetic energy. During frontal crash, which {{is by far the most}} dangerous impact situation, the front rails represent the main deformable components aimed to dissipate the kinetic energy of the vehicle, therefore their behaviour is crucial to obtain good vehicle performance, with stable and controlled energy dissipation. The design of the front rail, usually consisting of a thin-walled prismatic column, requires definition of the geometry, that is, of the shape and dimensions of the cross section, of the thickness of the material, and of the material itself. The results of an experimental programme aimed to study the progressive collapse behaviour of some thin-walled closed-section structural sections made from <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steels</b> and joined with different joining systems are reported. Solutions characterized by different continuous joining technologies, nonconventional for automotive constructions, are examined and compared to the usual spot-welding solution. Different types of adhesives (acrylic and epoxy) and laser-welding are considered. Furthermore, since the collapse is influenced by the loading rate and the materials used in this application are known to be strain-rate sensitive, static and impact loading conditions were examined. The obtained results demonstrate that continuously joined structures are at least equivalent to and generally better than spot-welded structures, and have further advantages typical of these joining solutions (higher stiffness and fatigue strength, improved vibration response, especially in the case of adhesive joints...|$|R

40|$|Deep drawing {{characteristics}} of cold rolled sheets and aluminum sheets are discussed. First priority {{is dedicated to}} the change of strain-rate value during press forming. With rise of strain-rate the deep drawing characteristics could be changed. Mostly uniaxial tensile test results are discussed. Steel material has been also tested by using a newly designed type of biaxial cruciform specimens. The most important basis for comparative evaluation of cold formability is derived from tensile testing. One of the deformation-dependent parameters influencing forming limits is hardness with close relation to elongation, deformation of grains and compressive instability. There were examined changes in micro-hardness of steel during plastic deformation, which is characterized by the area of non-homogenous deformation. Measuring of micro-hardness was realized after uniaxial tensile testing carried out on <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> sheets. Study of microstructure and texture development was also provided.

40|$|A {{conventional}} stereo Digital Image Correlation (DIC) setup involves two {{cameras to}} reconstruct a 3 D surface view. The field of view, however, is in practice often {{confined to a}} small region of the specimen. Indeed, in particular when large deformation occurs and sharp edges are present, {{a large part of}} the testing specimen is obscured. Accordingly, the full-field testing method is not capable to provide a global measurement in such cases. In this contribution, we present a multiple camera stereo DIC setup for obtaining a full deformation field, where "multiple" refers to the use of three or more cameras. The setup is applied to measure the deformations of a flat specimen subject to an Erichsen test. The specimen is made of a <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>steel</b> DC 06, and cut into a rectangular geometry. As a result of the Erichsen test, the specimen is bulged due to biaxial strain conditions. Multiple conventional stereo DIC measurements are firstly carried out to obtain the geometry of various sideviews of the bulged specimen. The results are then converted to a common reference frame to integrate the different sideviews into a single geometry. Next, the displacement field can be obtained by comparing the 3 D geometry before and after deformation. Finally, the global strain field can be derived from the displacement results. status: publishe...|$|E

Compared {{to the base}} metal, the formability of tailor-welded blank is less due {{to the presence of}} weld area and strength mismatch between component blanks. Most sheet metals used to produce tailor-welded blanks have anisotropy induced during pre-processing stage due to large deformation. The orientation of the blank sheet rolling direction and the combination of the blank sheet materials has significant influence on the deformation behaviour. The effect of anisotropy in the tailor-welded blank and the orientation of blank sheets rolling direction during deep-drawing process are investigated in this study. Finite element analysis of <b>deep-drawing</b> mild <b>steel</b> and dual-phase steel tailor-welded blank models was carried out using research purpose FE code DD 3 IMP; to form a basis for tailor-welded blank design and development for a part. Anisotropy in the blank sheets has moderate influence and its contribution to increased material flow depends on the mechanical properties of the blank sheets.
