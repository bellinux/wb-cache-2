5|$|The {{rearward}} {{of the two}} ports {{was fitted}} with plumbing to allow the station to be refueled by unmanned Progress spacecraft. These freighters, which brought supplies and <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> to keep the station replenished, helped ensure that the crew were always {{able to carry out}} useful scientific work aboard the station. In all, twelve Progress flights delivered over 20tonnes of equipment, supplies and fuel.|$|E
5|$|For safety, divers {{sometimes}} {{carry an}} additional independent scuba cylinder {{with its own}} regulator to mitigate out-of-air emergencies should the primary breathing gas supply fail. For much common recreational diving where a controlled emergency swimming ascent is acceptably safe, this <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> is not needed or used. This extra cylinder {{is known as a}} bail-out cylinder, and may be carried in several ways, and can be any size that can hold enough gas to get the diver safely back to the surface.|$|E
5|$|After the nationalization, {{the company}} started a {{renovation}} {{process of the}} infrastructure and rolling stock. Combined with a municipal policy of low fares, the company started going with a loss. Five new trams were delivered from 1948 to 1952, and built at the depot at Holtet, with used equipment {{from some of the}} older trams. An additional nine new trams were delivered between 1952 and 1955. Five additional trams were rebuilt from 1955 to 1960, by which time all the narrow trams had been rebuilt or retired. The use of a unique voltage gave operational difficulties, as fuses could regularly blow at Oslo Hospital if errors were made while switching from the one supply to the other. In addition, all the trams were custom-built with <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> with limited spare parts. All the trams delivered during the 1950s were built so they could later be converted to only use 600 volt supply. The depot was expanded in 1952.|$|E

5|$|Prior to {{the arrival}} of Isabel, Governor Ed Rendell {{declared}} a state of emergency for the state. The Pennsylvania Emergency Management Agency activated a support team to assist Urban Search and Rescue operations as part of the threat from the storm. The state's National Guard placed 2,990guardsmen on Emergency Condition 5 status to be deployed anywhere in the state for emergency support, with other guardsmen readying equipment such as generators, heavy trucks, water trailers, and engineer equipment for deployment. State police officers were readied for deployment, while the state health department contacted hospitals to ensure generators were in working condition. The state Environmental Protection Agency prepared for the storm by monitoring the status of all dams, water treatment facilities, and nuclear plants. In addition, the Pennsylvania Turnpike Commission stationed extra workers to patrol the highways in poor drainage areas, with <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> prepared for quick response for potential road blockage. Prior {{to the arrival}} of the storm, officials from PECO Energy prepared its largest workforce in its history with 1,500workers, including employees from Commonwealth Edison in Illinois and Detroit Edison.|$|E

25|$|Containers are {{transferred}} between rail, truck, and ship by container cranes at container terminals. Forklifts, reach stackers, straddle carriers, and cranes {{may be used}} to load and unload trucks or trains outside of container terminals.

50|$|A second {{batch of}} 13 {{locomotives}} {{was built for}} Dutch train maintenance company NedTrain. These locomotives are slightly longer due to the fitting of <b>extra</b> coupling <b>equipment,</b> and are used to shunt trains around their workshops.|$|R
50|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, Paula Giles {{successfully}} applied for the Low Power AM (LPAM) license from the Radio Authority and P Squared installed the <b>extra</b> audio <b>equipment</b> and transmission infrastructure prior to the on-air launch in September.|$|R
25|$|At {{the start}} of Operation Barbarossa, the single Gruppe of the Luftwaffe that was {{dedicated}} to ground support was II.(Schl)/LG 2, operating 22 Hs 123s (along with 38 Bf 109Es). In service use on the Eastern Front, the remaining aircraft had been field-modified with the main wheel spats removed, additional armour and <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> fitted as well as mounting extra machine guns and even cannons in under-wing housings.|$|E
25|$|If {{the input}} signal is periodic, the sweep {{repetition}} rate {{can be adjusted}} to display a few cycles of the waveform. Early (tube) oscilloscopes and lowest-cost oscilloscopes have sweep oscillators that run continuously, and are uncalibrated. Such oscilloscopes are very simple, comparatively inexpensive, and were useful in radio servicing and some TV servicing. Measuring voltage or time is possible, but only with <b>extra</b> <b>equipment,</b> and is quite inconvenient. They are primarily qualitative instruments.|$|E
25|$|The base subtypes {{could be}} {{equipped}} with Rüstsatz add-on standard field kits; in practice this meant hanging {{on some sort of}} additional equipment like droptanks, bombs or cannons to standard attachment points, present on all production aircraft. Aircraft could be modified in the factory with Umrüst-bausatz (Umbau) conversion kits or by adding <b>extra</b> <b>equipment,</b> called Rüstzustand, to convert standard airframes for special roles, a reconnaissance or bad-weather fighter, for example. Unlike the Rüstsatz field-kits, these modifications were permanent.|$|E
25|$|For example, the Daimler Double-Six was a Jaguar XJ-12, the Daimler {{badge and}} fluted top to its grille and boot handle {{being the only}} outward {{differences}} from the Jaguar, with more luxurious interior fittings and <b>extra</b> standard <b>equipment</b> marking {{it out on the}} inside.|$|R

50|$|In 1955 two T.7 {{aircraft}} were modified {{for use on}} the 1956 Commonwealth Trans-Antarctic Expedition, being designated Auster Antarctic (Auster Model C4). The aircraft had <b>extra</b> radio <b>equipment,</b> larger tail surfaces, {{the ability}} to be fitted with floats or skis as required and a bright yellow finish to increase visibility against the snow and ice.|$|R
25|$|Utility-scale {{wind farms}} must {{have access to}} {{transmission}} lines to transport energy. The wind farm developer may be obliged to install <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> or control systems in the wind farm to meet the technical standards set by the operator of a transmission line. The company or person that develops the wind farm can then sell the power on the grid through the transmission lines and ultimately chooses whether {{to hold on to}} the rights or sell the farm or parts of it to big business like GE, for example.|$|E
25|$|The {{connecting}} {{switch from}} the White Plains Road Line was not regularly {{used to bring}} in <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> or lay up a train on the Dyre Avenue Line itself until November 1952, and then only via new switches and the former Track 3, now Y1, at East 180th Street station. By this time some middle trackage had been restored as “Y3 and Y4” through Morris Park station and south of Dyre Avenue. The Y4 siding was later extended from Morris Park toward, but not to, Pelham Parkway by July 1971.|$|E
25|$|Effective {{use of any}} {{alternate}} {{air source}} requires competence in the associated skill set. The procedures for receiving air from another diver or from one's own equipment are most effective and least {{likely to result in}} a life-threatening incident if well trained {{to the extent that they}} do not distract the diver from other essential matters. A major difference from buddy breathing is that the diver using a redundant alternative air source need not alternate breathing with the donor, which can be a substantial advantage in many circumstances. There is a further significant advantage when the alternate air source is carried by the diver using it, in that it is not necessary to locate the buddy before it is available, but this comes at the cost of <b>extra</b> <b>equipment.</b>|$|E

These were the only trams used on this section.|$|R
50|$|HVDC is less {{reliable}} and has lower availability than alternating current (AC) systems, mainly {{due to the}} <b>extra</b> conversion <b>equipment.</b> Single-pole systems have availability of about 98.5%, with {{about a third of}} the downtime unscheduled due to faults. Fault-tolerant bipole systems provide high availability for 50% of the link capacity, but availability of the full capacity is about 97% to 98%.|$|R
25|$|The FDNY Hazardous Materials (Haz-Mat) Company, Haz-Mat 1 (quartered in Queens), {{responds}} to all major citywide hazardous materials incidents, building collapses, contamination-related incidents, terrorism-related disasters, major emergencies, {{and a variety}} of other incidents in which their services may be needed. Like the Rescue and Squad Companies of the FDNY, members of Haz-Mat Company 1 are experienced and specially trained to deal with hazardous situations. The Haz-Mat Company operates a Haz-Mat Truck, similar to a Rescue Truck, which carries a variety of equipment to deal with hazardous situations. Haz-Mat 1 also operates a smaller Rescue Truck which carries <b>extra</b> <b>equipment</b> not carried on the company's main piece of apparatus. The Haz-Mat Company is supplemented by the Squad Companies primarily, the Rescue Companies, and a handful of Engine Companies whose members are certified Haz-Mat Technicians. These Engine Companies, like the Squad Companies, also operate smaller step vans that carry Haz-Mat equipment.|$|E

25|$|Prejudice against {{hydraulic}} transmission {{in the higher}} echelons of BR's engineering divisions decreed in 1967 that all the WR's diesel-hydraulics were non-standard and should be withdrawn as soon as possible. Added to this were practical problems modernising the D800s: because of the scaled-down bodyshell {{there was very little}} room inside for <b>extra</b> <b>equipment.</b> It was, for example, physically impossible to accommodate a compressor as well as an exhauster, so the locomotives were unable to haul newer designs of air-braked coaching stock. It also proved impractical to equip them with electric train heating (ETH) equipment, for similar reasons, so they retained unreliable steam heat boilers to the end of their lives. It was intended to equip no. D870 with ETH; to provide the necessary additional power, the engines would have been uprated by the fitment of charge-air coolers. No work was actually carried out, other than the fitment of appropriate jumper cables on the locomotive ends.|$|E
50|$|The normal crew {{configuration}} is one {{pilot and}} two paramedics. The pilots are employed by Heli Charter while the paramedics are employed by South Western Ambulance Service and seconded to Wiltshire Air Ambulance. The aircraft is fitted with an Aerolite medical interior. On board {{is all the}} kit found on a land ambulance, with <b>extra</b> specialist <b>equipment,</b> all paid for by donations.|$|R
25|$|All early {{variants}} seated {{pilot in}} front and two passengers behind him, in common cabin. The first production variant was Mi-1, quickly replaced by improved Mi-1T, that carried <b>extra</b> operational <b>equipment</b> including full radio and blind-flying instruments, and had more reliable engine AI-26V. The next basic variant was the Mi-1A of 1957, with further increased reliability and provisions for one 160 l external fuel tank.|$|R
