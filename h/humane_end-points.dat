40|$|Tuberculosis (TB) {{remains a}} serious global health threat and an {{improved}} vaccine is urgently needed. New candidate TB vaccines are tested using preclinical animal models such as mice, guinea pigs, cattle and non-human primates. Animals are routinely infected with virulent Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M. tb) in challenge experiments to evaluate protective efficacy, raising ethical issues regarding the procedure of infection itself, symptoms {{of disease and}} <b>humane</b> <b>end-points.</b> We summarise the importance and limitations of animal models in TB vaccine research and review current alternatives and modifications {{in the context of}} the NC 3 Rs framework for replacing, reducing and refining the use of animals for scientific purposes...|$|E
40|$|Burkholderia mallei is a host-adapted {{bacterium}} {{that does}} not persist outside of its equine reservoir. The organism causes the zoonosis glanders, which is endemic in Asia, Africa, the Middle East and South America. Infection by B. mallei typically occurs via the respiratory or percutaneous route, and the most common manifestations are life-threatening pneumonia and bacteremia. Glanders is difficult to diagnose and requires prolonged antibiotic therapy with low success rates. There is no vaccine to protect against B. mallei and there is concern regarding its use as a biothreat agent. Thus, experiments were performed to establish a non-human primate model of intranasal infection to study the organism and develop countermeasures. Groups of marmosets (Callithrix jacchus) were inoculated intranasally with B. mallei strain ATCC 23344 and monitored for clinical signs of illness for up to 13 days. We discovered that 83 % of marmosets inoculated with doses of 2. 5 X 10 (4) to 2. 5 X 10 (5) bacteria developed acute lethal infection within 3 - 4 days. Signs of disease were severe and included lethargy, inappetence, conjunctivitis, mucopurulent and hemorrhagic nasal discharges, and increased respiratory effort with abdominal lifts. Burkholderia mallei was cultured from the lungs, spleen and liver of these animals, and pathologic examination of tissues revealed lesions characteristic of glanders. Challenge experiments also revealed that 91 % of animals infected with doses ranging from 25 to 2. 5 X 10 (3) bacteria exhibited mild non-specific signs of illness and were culture negative. One marmoset inoculated with 2. 5 X 10 (3) organisms developed moderate signs of disease and reached <b>humane</b> <b>end-points</b> 8 days post-infection. The liver and spleen of this animal were colonized with the agent and pathological analysis of tissues showed nasal, splenic and hepatic lesions. Taken together, these data indicate that the marmoset is a suitable model to study respiratory infection by B. mallei...|$|E
40|$|Maintenance {{of health}} and welfare of a {{cephalopod}} is essential whether {{it is in a}} research, aquaculture or public display. The inclusion of cephalopods in the European Union legislation (Directive 2010 / 63 /EU) regulating the use of animals for scientific purposes has prompted detailed consideration and review of all aspects of the care and welfare of cephalopods in the laboratory but the information generated will be of utility in other settings. We overview a wide range of topics of relevance to cephalopod digestive tract physiology and their relationship to the health and welfare of these animals. Major topics reviewed include: (i) Feeding cephalopods in captivity which deals with live food and prepared diets, feeding frequency (ad libitum vs. intermittent) and the amount of food provided; (ii) The particular challenges in feeding hatchlings and paralarvae, as feeding and survival of paralarvae remain major bottlenecks for aquaculture e. g., Octopus vulgaris; (iii) Digestive tract parasites and ingested toxins are discussed not only {{from the perspective of the}} impact on digestive function and welfare but also as potential confounding factors in research studies; (iv) Food deprivation is sometimes necessary (e. g., prior to anesthesia and surgery, to investigate metabolic control) but what is the impact on a cephalopod, how can it be assessed and how does the duration relate to regulatory threshold and severity assessment? Reduced food intake is also reviewed in the context of setting <b>humane</b> <b>end-points</b> in experimental procedures; (v) A range of experimental procedures are reviewed for their potential impact on digestive tract function and welfare including anesthesia and surgery, pain and stress, drug administration and induced developmental abnormalities. The review concludes by making some specific recommendations regarding reporting of feeding data and identifies a number of areas for further investigation. The answer to many of the questions raised here will rely on studies of the physiology of the digestive tract...|$|E
40|$|Food futures: ethics, {{science and}} culture, p. 499 – 504. Within the ethical {{discussion}} of animal experimentation, {{the questions of}} why, how many, {{and under what circumstances}} animals are (or should be) used takes precedence over the fact that virtually all lab animals are killed after their scientific utility. When death is indeed an issue, the discussion often concerns the circumstances of death, from a welfare point-of view. This is a likely consequence of two factors: firstly, killing being seen as an inevitable consequence of animal use and, second, a predominantly “welfarist-utilitarian” influence in the ethical and legal framework on the acceptability of animal research. While the former leads to the killing of lab animals being implicitly accepted along with the acceptance of animal research itself, the latter makes death a lesser issue (provided it is carried out humanely), as “being dead” is not in itself seen as a welfare problem, and the early euthanasia of animal models of disease can moreover prevent avoidable suffering (i. e. by <b>humane</b> <b>end-points).</b> In this landscape, animal experimentation without the burden of killing animals seems unfeasible, if not undesirable. However, while acknowledging that most studies do require killing animals out of scientific (e. g. from the need to extract large-enough samples from small animals) or ethical (when animals would otherwise suffer needlessly) necessity, it remains to be ascertained whether a) this is true for all cases or b) that curtailing the life of laboratory animals is of little ethical importance. Accepting that – at least some – animal research is relevant, ethically acceptable and presently not replaceable, it should nevertheless be reflected upon whether there can be a scientific, ethical and legal framework within which a “no-kill” approach may be equated, for some cases. A few examples are herein presented to discuss current possibilities and constraints, and help identify under which circumstances can a new set of “ 3 Rs” – Re-use, Rehabilitation and Rehoming – be applied {{as an alternative to the}} killing of animals when their scientific usefulness ends...|$|E
40|$|Antivenom is {{the only}} {{effective}} treatment for snakebite and comprise immunoglobulins obtained from venom-immunised horses or sheep. Globally, more than 45 manufacturers make over 120 snake antivenoms; it is a regulatory requirement that the venom-neutralising efficacy of all antivenoms are assessed preclinically. The World Health Organisation (WHO) recommended preclinical tests of efficacy are the median lethal venom dose (LD 50) and median effective antivenom dose (ED 50) assays performed in mice. They result in substantial pain and suffering to the mice with death/survival as their metric. With NC 3 R-funding, we sought to apply the ‘Refine, Reduce and Replace’ principles of animal experimentation to these murine assays. Pain is a near-universal symptom of snake envenoming, {{and one of our}} objectives was to identify an effective analgesic that could be utilised without invalidating the assay results. The Mouse Grimace Scale and Activity scores were used to measure pain. We examined the effects of two opioid analgesics, buprenorphine and morphine, in a range of venom LD 50 and ED 50 assays. Both were effective at reducing pain scores, but death rates were higher in those which had received buprenorphine, hence morphine is preferable. We demonstrate that each venom exhibits a distinct set of lesions, the severity of which appears time and dose dependent, and that the observed murine pathological lesions show significant similarities to those reported in envenomed human victims. Applying the 3 R principles, we have used pathological observations, in combination with ante mortem observations, to establish more <b>humane</b> <b>end-points,</b> consequently reducing the duration of LD 50 and ED 50 assays from 24 to 6 hours. In addition, we have implemented a ‘dose-staging’ element into experimental design in which one dose is given and the next dose(s) selected {{based on the results of}} the previous dose, reducing total mice required. To reduce the numbers of assays, and therefore mice, we have shown an excellent correlation between in vitro binding assays, cytotoxicity neutralisation assays and in vivo ED 50 using antivenoms derived from the same pool of donor animals. Comparison of the results of in vitro binding assays between 35 different venom/antivenom combinations showed a poor correlation overall, but the correlation improved when each of five venoms were considered separately. The possibility of replacing the in vivo LD 50 and ED 50 tests, using a cell-based neutralisation assay was investigated using two cell lines from diverse tissues of origin, namely VERO epithelial-type cells and neural SH SY 5 Y. All venoms studied produced a cytopathic effect in both cell lines, with the VERO cells being more sensitive to viper venoms and SH SY 5 Y cells to the effects of elapid venoms, when both cell lines were grown in co-culture. However, variability of results made optimisation of a neutralisation assay inadequate for use as an alternative to in vivo tests...|$|E
