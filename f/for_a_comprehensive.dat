5|$|On 19 September 1957, the US {{conducted}} the first contained underground test at the Nevada Test Site, codenamed Rainier. The Rainier shot complicated the push <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> test ban, as underground tests {{could not be}} as easily identified as atmospheric tests.|$|E
5|$|In early 1960, Eisenhower {{indicated}} {{his support}} <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> test ban conditional on proper monitoring of underground tests. On 11 February 1960, Wadsworth {{announced a new}} US proposal by which only tests deemed verifiable by the Geneva System would be banned, including all atmospheric, underwater, and outer-space tests within detection range. Underground tests measuring more than 4.75 on the Richter scale would also be barred, subject to revision as research on detection continued. Adopting Macmillan's quota compromise, the US proposed each nuclear state be subject to roughly 20 on-site inspections per year (the precise figure based on the frequency of seismic events).|$|E

5|$|Nuclear {{weapons were}} {{developed}} during World War II by the wartime Manhattan Project. Key scientists {{working on the}} project anticipated that their development would have wide-ranging implications. However the project director, Major General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., was reluctant to spend project funds on activities beyond those required to win the war. Nonetheless, Arthur Compton of the Metallurgical Project in Chicago commissioned a report on post-war nuclear energy, and the Military Policy Committee, the Manhattan Project's governing body, commissioned a similar study by Richard Tolman. Both reports called <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive,</b> government-supported nuclear energy program, with military, scientific, and industrial aspects.|$|E
5|$|Smyth {{advocated}} {{within the}} NDRC <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> report {{to be released}} to the public following the weapon's first use. Vannevar Bush, who as civilian director of the OSRD oversaw the NDRC, agreed, and selected Smyth to write the report following the recommendation of NDRC chairman James Bryant Conant. Groves granted Smyth unlimited access, waiving his usual security-minded insistence on compartmentalization. Smyth wrote {{what became known as the}} Smyth Report in his office in Princeton's Palmer Laboratory, which later became the Frist Campus Center.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day, 19 October 2011, Deputy Prime Minister, Coordinating Minister for National Security and Minister for Home Affairs Teo Chee Hean {{explained the}} relevance of the ISA and its powers of preventive detention. He noted that in the 1960s preventive detention was primarily used to counter the subversive Communist threat posed by the Malayan Communist Party which was hiding within legal organizations. For the past two decades, though, preventive detention has helped safeguard Singapore's national security by countering threats posed by espionage and terrorism. Preventive detention allows <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>comprehensive</b> assessment of a threat, as opposed to a criminal case tried before a court which requires the court to consider only the specific acts that relate to the charge. Detaining those who have not yet committed overt deeds that warrant prosecution also allows pre-emptive action to be taken to neutralize threats before they materialize into actual harm. In addition, the Minister said that detention without trial is preferable in situations where open prosecutions in court are not practicable due to the confidentiality of certain intelligence. Such intelligence might have been obtained through foreign security agencies on the understanding that the source and details would not be disclosed to an open court. What is more, disclosure of confidential intelligence could compromise ongoing or future operations through the revelation of existing sources and methods of intelligence gathering. However, if confidential information were withheld from the court, a criminal case could be weakened due to evidential requirements, which may result in the acquittal of an otherwise guilty accused. Finally, court proceedings may stall investigations {{as part of a broader}} network, and could exacerbate situations where communal sensitivities are involved.|$|E
