30|$|Although {{the best}} fitting model {{suggests}} that <b>job</b> crafting and <b>autonomy</b> support are both important factors predicting workplace well-being, {{it is also}} possible that there is a synergistic association, such that the highest levels of well-being occur when both <b>job</b> crafting and <b>autonomy</b> support are present. We explored this possibility in two ways. First, we estimated three linear regressions, predicting PA, NA, and job satisfaction from <b>job</b> crafting, <b>autonomy</b> support, and the interaction of the two. The interaction term was computed by multiplying the centered composite job crafting (JC) and autonomy support (AS) predictor variables (Aiken and West 1991). The interaction was significant for PA (β =  0.118, p =  0.02), and non-significant for NA (β =  0.017, p =  0.77) and job satisfaction (β =  0.019, p =  0.71). This finding suggests that employees who engaged in high levels of job crafting and who perceived their managers as high on autonomy support had the highest levels of positive affect, whereas employees who engaged in the lowest levels of job crafting and who perceived their managers as low on autonomy support had the lowest levels of positive affect.|$|R

Forty-two employees completed first a questionnaire and then a diary survey over 5 consecutive workdays. In line with predictions, results of multilevel analyses revealed that general perceptions of job resources related positively to daily job resources. In addition, positive emotions mediated the relationship between daily <b>job</b> resources (<b>autonomy</b> and psychological climate of cooperation and warmth) and daily personal resources. Finally, general perceptions of the three job resources had an indirect effect on daily personal resources through the respective daily job resources and daily positive emotions.

5000|$|Likewise, work {{flexibility}} affects job satisfaction. In fact, {{the flexibility}} to decide when work is performed ranks number one among women and number two or three among men in determining {{the characteristics of a}} satisfying job. Similar to <b>job</b> <b>autonomy,</b> job flexibility is more important than income when evaluating job satisfaction. [...] Flexibility to determine one's work schedule is an important contributor to job satisfaction across the spectrum of low- and high-income jobs. Work flexibility empowers employees by reducing the incidence of work-family conflicts and engagement in planned quitting to improve overall quality of life. Positive affect is a fringe benefit of work flexibility that pays rich dividends to both employees and their employers, empowering the former and improving the ability of the latter to retain workers.|$|E

50|$|<b>Job</b> <b>autonomy</b> may {{be defined}} as the {{condition}} of being self-governing or free from excessive external control in the workplace environment. The German philosopher Immanuel Kant believed that autonomy is important to human beings because it is the foundation of human dignity and the source of all morality. Among the models of human growth and development that are centred on autonomy, the most theoretically sophisticated approach has been developed around the concepts of self-regulation and intrinsic motivation. Self-determination theory proposes that 'higher behavioural effectiveness, greater volitional persistence, enhanced subjective well-being, and better assimilation of the individual within his or her social group' result when individuals act from motivations that emanate from the inner self (intrinsic motivation) rather than from sources of external regulation. For self-determination theorists, it is the experience of an external locus of causation (or the belief that one's actions are controlled by external forces) that undermines the most powerful source of natural motivation and that (when chronic) also can lead to stultification, weak self-esteem, anxiety and depression, and alienation. Thus, health and well-being as well as effective performance in social settings are closely related to the experience of autonomy. Hackman and Oldham developed the Job Characteristics Model, a framework that focused attention on autonomy and four other key factors involved in designing enriched work. Work designed to be complex and challenging (characterized by high levels of autonomy, skill variety, identity, significance, and feedback) was theorized to promote high intrinsic motivation, job satisfaction, and overall work performance. Two decades of research in this tradition have shown that job scope or complexity, an additive combination of autonomy and the four other job characteristics: (a) is correlated significantly with more objective ratings of job characteristics; (b) may be reduced to a primary factor consisting of autonomy and skill variety; and (c) has substantial effects on affective and behavioural reactions to work, mostly indirectly through critical psychological states such as experienced responsibility for the outcomes of the work. It is possible to infer from this line of research that the experience of autonomy at work has positive consequences ranging from higher job performance to job satisfaction and enhanced general well-being, which are both related to the concept of happiness at work.|$|E

The Leiden Quality of Work Life Questionnaire was used to assess experienced <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> among maternity care professionals. Setting: Data were collected in the Netherlands in 2015. Participants: 799 professionals participated of whom 362 were primary care midwives, 240 obstetricians, 93 clinical midwives and 104 obstetric nurses. Findings: The mean score for experienced <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> was highest for primary care midwives, followed by obstetricians, clinical midwives and obstetric nurses.

This finding points to a reciprocal process between <b>job</b> crafting and <b>autonomy</b> support, whereby employees can potentially craft their experience of work to obtain more autonomy support into their roles, and vice versa—autonomy support can provide greater scope for employees to engage in job crafting in organizations.

Accordingly, literature reflects increasing {{interest in the}} relevance of attachment theory to vocational and organizational phenomena. In the current study, we focused on associations of avoidant attachment orientation (characterized by obsessive self-reliance), anxious attachment orientation (characterized by over-dependence), and a central job characteristic (<b>job</b> <b>autonomy)</b> with work-related attitudes and emo-tions (work engagement, career commitment, work burnout, and emotional distress). Results from 150 Israeli employees revealed significant associations between avoidant attachment and all work-related outcomes, while anxiety was associated only with work burnout and emotional distress. <b>Job</b> <b>autonomy</b> was associated with all work-related outcomes, and although attachment anxiety and avoidance were not associated with <b>job</b> <b>autonomy,</b> the interactions between avoidance and <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> (but not the interactions between anxiety and <b>job</b> <b>autonomy)</b> significantly contributed to explained variance of all work outcomes.

40|$|While much {{research}} has focused on self-leadership, few researches have addressed how, why and when this appears. This thesis presents a quantitative research on the effects of the need for autonomy and <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> on self-leadership. Based on the literature on self-leadership, the Job-Demands Resources Model, the Job-Demands Control Model and the Self-Determination Theory, we hypothesized that employees with a high need for autonomy and much job-autonomy would be most likely to posses self-leadership skills. Employees from several health organizations (N= 222) completed a questionnaire containing an existing self-leadership scale, an existing scale for <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> and a new scale to measure need for <b>job</b> <b>autonomy.</b> The results of the multiple regression analyses revealed that the need for <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> and <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> both predict self-leadership. The effect of the need for autonomy on self-leadership is stronger than the effect of <b>job</b> <b>autonomy</b> on self-leadership.
