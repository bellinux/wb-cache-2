25|$|During {{and just}} after the Second World War, from 1940 to 1946, St Dunstan's now Blind Veterans UK, was based in the town. The {{charitable}} service (for blinded armed forces personnel) was moved from Sussex as Church Stretton {{was thought to be}} a safe location. Some 700 people were trained during this period in Church Stretton in an industrial training centre set up at a malthouse in Sandford Avenue. The Long Mynd Hotel, the Denehurst Hotel, the Brockhurst Estate and Tiger Hall were the most notable buildings taken over by St Dunstan's in the town. A residential cul-de-sac is named St Dunstan's Close in recognition of the charity's place in the town's history. The Long Mynd was considered to be a potential landing place for German parachutists, although Church Stretton avoided the aerial bombing of the war; the only death recorded in the district by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission of a civilian war casualty was of a <b>Firewatcher</b> from Manchester who died while being treated at the St Dunstan's Hospital.|$|E

5000|$|The Current {{reviewing}} the album wrote, [...] "I thought she leaned too adult-contemporary for my tastes. Boy, was I wrong! This might be her most rockin' album to date. The album starts {{like a house}} afire: Carlile totally nails the vocal on the gospel influenced [...] "Wherever is Your Heart," [...] and this one makes you realize just how good she is. When she sings, you're a believer. She'll have you singing along on the infectious [...] "The Thing I Regret". Maybe the biggest surprise on the album is [...] "Mainstream Kid," [...] which shows some grit! It's as badass as Carlile has ever sounded. If you had Brandi Carlile pegged as an adult-contemporary softie, you might try again. Brandi Carlile and the Hanseroth twins show that they aren't afraid to rock out. The <b>Firewatcher's</b> Daughter is a bold and welcome addition to her catalogue." [...] USA Today wrote, [...] "The <b>Firewatcher's</b> Daughter is an album with a big heart, one that responds with love, not fear." ...|$|R

It was whilst at Derby that Percy had a football pools win of £52 which enabled him to buy his first motor car which was a Morris Eight for which he paid £45.|$|E

5000|$|Though {{small in}} stature, Joyce was strikingly beautiful, with {{chestnut}} hair and green eyes. Because of a then-common prejudice against pianists with British-sounding names, her advisors had long {{urged her to}} adopt a name with a continental flavour, but she stubbornly refused. Perhaps partly in compensation, but perhaps simply as a natural expression of herself, she enjoyed and exploited the glamour of celebrity. She changed her evening gowns to suit the music she was playing: blue for Beethoven, red for Tchaikovsky, lilac for Liszt, black for Bach, green for Chopin, sequins for Debussy, and red and gold for Schumann. She also arranged her hair differently depending on the composer - up for Beethoven, falling free for Grieg and Debussy, and drawn back for Mozart. The critics sneered, but her audiences loved it. Up until 1940 she designed her own gowns, but in August she volunteered as a <b>firewatcher,</b> which revived her chronic rheumatism, so on the LPO tours she had to wear a plaster cast encasing her shoulder and back. She bought gowns specially designed by Norman Hartnell to cover the cast, and she often wore Hartnell thereafter. Richard Bonynge was a music student in Sydney during her 1948 tour, and he said: [...] "She brought such glamour to the concert stage. We all used to flock to her concerts, not least because of the extraordinary amount of cleavage she used to show!".|$|E
40|$|Raised {{among the}} forests and {{mountains}} of the Pacific North west, Snyder kindled his passion for the environment {{at an early age}} - a passion that would ultimately distance him from the Beat movement at its very beginnings. Snyder tempered his love of nature with stints of physical labor as a trail builder, logger, and <b>firewatcher.</b> Pursuing his interests in Zen Buddhism and Asian culture, Snyder accepted a scholarship from the First Zen Institute of America to study in Japan only a year after his participation in the 1955 Six Gallery reading. This scholarship would send Snyder over seas for ten years, his involvement in the Beat movement eclipsed by his Zen Buddhist devotion and artistic exploration abroad. This traveling period of Snyder 2 ̆ 7 s life would see his first publications and contribute to his success as a Pulitzer Prize winning poet on his return. [URL]...|$|E

25|$|When {{this picture}} was taken, almost every {{building}} immediately around St Paul's had burned down, with the cathedral surviving in a wasteland of destruction.

Twenty-nine incendiaries fell on and around the cathedral, with one burning through the lead dome and threatening to fall into the dome's wooden support beams.
