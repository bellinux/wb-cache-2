50|$|Significant tax {{savings are}} {{available}} through commuter benefits programs for both employers and employees. If offered as a pretax benefit, employees save on their federal payroll taxes because the amount designated by the employee is deducted from their gross income, and employers save {{because they are not}} required to pay payroll taxes on such <b>deducted</b> <b>amount.</b> And for employees who are subject to state and local taxes that recognize pretax benefits, their savings can be even greater. Employers who provide the benefit as a tax-free fringe benefit (paid by the employer) save on payroll taxes because the employer does not need to include the amount of the fringe benefit in the employee’s gross income. Normally, the amount of any fringe benefit provided to employees must be included in the employee’s gross income, but qualified transportation fringe benefits provided under section 132(f) are excluded from this requirement.|$|E

Placing paddles also <b>deducts</b> a small <b>amount</b> of time. Lives are removed, because this version allows any previously reached level to be played on demand. This version also added a [...] "combo" [...] system whereby the ball may be precisely placed to touch multiple targets at the same time; doing this multiple times in series awards additional points. This version also has a distinctive soundtrack composed of piano chords and arpeggios that trigger on events in the game, and commentary by a voice-over reminiscent of Fluttershy from My Little Pony. Although released in series with them, Deflex is not a Minotaur Project game.|$|R
