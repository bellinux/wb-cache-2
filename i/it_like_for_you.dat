Metaprocessing {{is the cornerstone}} of AEDP methodology. The intent of metaprocessing is to maximize the power of transformance moments by exploring the experience of having the experience as it is happening (for example, the therapist may ask, [...] "what is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have had this deep emotional experience right now?"), especially in the context of experiences that are therapeutic or positive. [...] Slowing down the emotional experience (somatic, emotional, cognitive) through [...] "moment-to-moment tracking", not only primes its neuroplastic potential, but allows the therapist to help the patient maintain a well-regulated, as opposed to overwhelming, emotional experience (dyadic affect regulation). A second form of relational metaprocessing asks the patient what it was like “to do this with me?” (“dyadic affective reflective process”) which further [...] "undoes the patient’s aloneness", while also strengthening the attachment bond for further emotional work. Empirical studies confirm clinical observations that positive emotions naturally arise following metaprocessing. Positive emotions fortify the patient's healing experience and promote enhanced resilience.|$|E

First, it explains how the idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma was inspired by the artificial intelligence research on computer checkers and computer chess. Second, it shows how the vulnerability of simple reciprocity to misunderstanding or misimplementation can be eliminated with the addition of some degree of generosity or contrition. Third, it recounts the unusual collaboration between the author, a political scientist, and William D. Hamilton, an evolutionary biologist. 1 This article is a response to three questions, starting with the one I am asked most often. 1. How did you get the idea for a computer tournament for the iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma? 2. After thirty years and nine thousand citations, do you see any problems with your early work on the evolution of cooperation? 3.

A semi-structured interview with open-ended questions [(i) What is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have CF?; (ii) Do you have any special needs because you have CF? (iii) How do you envision your future?] was conducted with 42 CF adolescents’ patients. We investigated how adolescents faces CF, identified their needs, and how they envision the future. The {{results show that the}} adolescents’ emotions included fear of death, embarrassment, and anger. Other concerns included the loss of freedom, falling behind at school, a loss of friends, equality and acceptance, and the future perspectives. These feelings and concerns were influenced by the disease and may affect coping with CF. Few studies have examined adolescents’ adjustment to living with CF in South America; understanding how to live with CF in adolescence contributes to new psychological interventions for patients and families, stimulate new research, and assist healthcare professionals and others who work and care specific to CF adolescents...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} {{if you choose to}} have a child by {{consulting}} your preferences, where your preferences are based upon projections about what <b>it</b> would be <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have a child, your choice is not rational. The problem is not a problem for decision theory, for decision theory has the resources to handle the problem if we change the mode of decision-making. The problem is rather a problem for our ordinary conception of major life-changing decisions as rational decisions. The argument combines three independently plausible premises. The first premise is derived from the widely adopted cultural practice of deciding whether or not to have a child by making a careful assessment of what <b>it</b> would be <b>like.</b> The second premise is that this assessment is performed in order <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to compare what <b>it</b> would be <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to become a parent to what <b>it</b> would be <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to remain childless, so that you can choose the best outcome. The third premise is that the experience of having a child is a unique, radically transformative experience. Having one’s first child is psychologically life-changing; an experience like no other. After defending these three premises, I use them to argue that if one wants to choose rationally, one cannot apply our ordinary decision-making procedure when choosing whether to become a parent...|$|R

This qualitative study explored and described the lived experiences of women who are part of a blended family in a community. Guidelines will be developed from these lived experiences for advanced psychiatric nurse practitioners to assist women to cope {{as an integral part of}} promoting their mental health. A qualitative, explorative and contextual research design was utilised and one central question was asked “What is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> being part of a blended family?”The researcher intended to use purposive sampling but the strategy changed to snowballing as it was difficult to locate potential participants. Semi-structured phenomenological interviews were conducted until data saturation was reached. Data was analysed using open coding. The results were re-contextualised into literature. The findings in this study indicate that being part of a blended family is demanding and challenging as evidenced by emotional distress, a loss sense of self, uncertainty of being in blended marriage. Women also experience being victimized and alienated in blended families as evidenced by interference of ex-spouse, disruptive behaviour of stepchildren and relationship tension between husband and wife. The participants acknowledged that being part of a blended family or blending a family altered their ability to cope [“I used a lot of grand-pa unconsciously so and I depended on it [...] .

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a research study using grounded theory methodology {{to explore the}} experiences {{of women who have}} unplanned abdominal surgery at the time of childbirth, commonly referred to as casearean section. The intent {{of this study was to}} describe, understand and finally encapsulate in a model the personal impact on mothers of unplanned abdominal surgery at the the time of birth, for women who receive care within the current New Zealand maternity services. Ten participants who had unplanned casearean sections were asked to share their personal experiences during unstructured interviews. The question asked was: What was <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> when you had your baby and what does it mean for you now? The data analysis in this study shows the experience for these mothers to be very stressful. Coming to terms with a birthing experience that did not meet their expectations, feelings of loss of control, unexpected pain and discomfort, difficulty in nurturing their babies and a great need to experience birth were all revealed. Mothers felt they were not listened to by some midwives and as a result had many unmet needs. Some midwives and health professionals appeared to view the major abdominal surgery that occurred as an alternative method of birthing, often trivialising the impact of the surgery and significance of having a casearean birth for this group of mothers. The implications for midwives and maternity services providers are broad, including the need for continuity of care and specialist nursing and midwifery care to meet the needs of this small but significant group of mothers and their babies...|$|E

The interviewing process used a phenomenological approach which focused on the meaning that police officers made of their work. 2 ̆ 2 Meaning 2 ̆ 2 relates to the personal interpretations and evaluations that officers make of their work experiences. ^ The interview process consisted of three ninety-minute interviews with each participant. The first interview centered around the question, 2 ̆ 2 How did you come to work as a police officer? 2 ̆ 2 The second interview focused upon the question, 2 ̆ 2 What is <b>it</b> <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to work as a police officer? 2 ̆ 2 And the third interview asked, 2 ̆ 2 What does it mean to you to work as a police officer? 2 ̆ 2 ^ The interview were audio-recorded and later transcribed. After significant transcript material had been identified, it was then synthesized in two ways: first, as profiles of the participants; and second, as excerpts from the interviews which were woven together with emergent themes that connected the stressful experiences of the participants. Eighteen themes relative to occupational stress emerged from the data. Themes associated with autocratic management practices of police organizations were the most frequently perceived occupational stressors by the participants of this study. ^ The author suggests that police work is no more stressful than other high-stress occupations, though police work seems to be very stressful because autocratic management practices intensify other stressors. Management reform seems to be an important task for the future well being of police officers. If police management styles become more democratic and supportive, there could be an across the board reduction in the negative affects of many occupational stressors. Officer health and job performance could subsequently improve. ^ The author suggests that stress plays a critical role in the meaning that police officers make of their work. Stress has become the currency through which officers exchange meaning. Stress is the psychic Purple Heart of policing and validates an officer 2 ̆ 7 s experience. ...|$|E

A relevÃncia do tema {{consiste}} na premÃncia em diagnosticar e tratar os episÃdios reacionais hansÃnicos, eventos inflamatÃrios agudos no curso de uma doenÃa crÃnica, que pode acometer os indivÃduos antes da hansenÃase, durante o tratamento e apÃs a alta. Tem-se como objetivo compreender a vivÃncia dos corpos com episÃdio reacional hansÃnico no Ãmbito individual, familiar e comunitÃrio. Parte-se do pressuposto que os episÃdios reacionais marcam a vida das pessoas contribuindo para o estigma e o isolamento social. Constituindo-se numa investigaÃÃo de carÃter qualitativo, desenvolvida Ã luz da fenomenologia existencial, este estudo teve como cenÃrio o centro de referÃncia em hansenÃase no municÃpio de Floriano no PiauÃ. Foram realizadas nove entrevistas fenomenolÃgicas, em abril de 2012, sendo quatro com mulheres e cinco com homens que vivem ou viveram tal experiÃncia. Para desvelar o fenÃmeno da vivÃncia com episÃdios reacionais, elaborou-se a questÃo norteadora: âComo Ã para vocÃ ter tido hansenÃase e apresentado episÃdio reacionalâ (considerando a sua vida pessoal, familiar e comunitÃria) ? Desse modo, as falas dos sujeitos-colaboradores foram analisadas na perspectiva dos estudiosos da fenomenologia existencial. A anÃlise das descriÃÃes permitiu identificar as unidades temÃticas: corpos doÃdos â a descoberta da hansenÃase; corpos rachados â vivÃncia e transformaÃÃo do corpo com episÃdio reacional hansÃnico; corpos quebrados â a incerteza da cura pela sequela; corpos ressignificados â mudanÃa na vida apÃs o episÃdio reacional hansÃnico; corpos sentidos â vivÃncia na famÃlia e comunidade; corpos disciplinados â vivÃncia no serviÃo de saÃde. A compreensÃo do fenÃmeno culminou com o pressuposto elaborado, possibilitando desvelar algumas facetas que significam para os sujeitos-colaboradores transformaÃÃes no seu mundo, ocasionadas pela manutenÃÃo dos episÃdios reacionais, pelas incapacidades fÃsicas instaladas e pelas limitaÃÃes funcionais repercutidas nas atividades laborais e nos aspectos socioeconÃmicos da existÃncia mundana, fortalecendo, assim, o estigma social que permeia a hansenÃase/episÃdios reacionais. Revelou tambÃm a autonomia do cuidado de si enfatizado pelo conhecimento da doenÃa e pelas suas implicaÃÃes; o apoio familiar e comunitÃrio indispensÃvel no modo de lidar com o adoecer e a possibilidade de ressignificar os encontros produtores de vida entre profissionais de saÃde e pessoas acometidas pela hansenÃase/episÃdios reacionais, considerando-se os saberes e as prÃticas existencialmente construÃdas. Leprosy is a stigmatized {{high power}} incapacitating disease which is partly attributed to leprosy reactional states. The relevance of this theme is {{the urgent need}} to diagnose and treat leprosy reaction episodes, acute inflammatory events {{in the course of}} a chronic, disease that can affect individuals of leprosy before, during treatment and after discharge. It aims to understand the experience of bodies with reactive episode of leprosy at the individual, family and community ambits. This is on the assumption that the reactive episodes mark the lives of people contributing to stigma and social isolation. It is a qualitative research, developed at the light of existential phenomenology. This study was set at the reference center for leprosy in the city of Floriano in PiauÃ. There were nine phenomenological interviews, in April 2012, with four women and five men who had or have lived such experience. To reveal the phenomenon of living with leprosy reactions, we were led to question: "What is <b>it</b> <b>like,</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have leprosy and the reactional episode presented" (considering their personal, family and community) ? Thus, the subjectsâ speeches were analyzed from the perspective of scholars of existential phenomenology. The analysis of descriptions led us to identify the thematic units: aching bodies - the discovery of leprosy; cracked bodies - and body transformation experience; broken bodies - the uncertainty of cure due to sequels; re-signified bodies - life changes after leprosy reaction episodes; body senses - experience in family and community; disciplined bodies - experience in the health care service. The understanding of the phenomenon culminated with the drawn assumption, allowing us to reveal some facets that mean for subject-transformations and changes in their lives, occasioned by the maintenance of leprosy reaction episodes, installed by physical disabilities and functional limitations reflected in the labor activities and Socioeconomic aspects of mundane existence, thus strengthening the social stigma that permeates leprosy / leprosy reaction episodes. It also revealed the autonomy of self-care emphasized by the knowledge of the disease and its implications, the family and community support needed in order to deal with the sickness, and the ability to reframe life producing encounters between health professionals and people affected by leprosy; considering the knowledge and practices existentially built...|$|E

The increasing number of youths afflicted with weight problems in the United States is of epidemic proportion, and the impact of dealing with this weight crisis must be examined. The researcher examined the psychological effects of obesity/overweight on adolescents and the coping mechanisms they used. The results from this study increase knowledge on how best to intervene with prevention and treatment measures for adolescent obesity/overweight issues. The Stress, Coping, Adaptation Theory by Lazarus was utilized as the theoretical framework for this qualitative study. It is based upon the idea that coping with stressors is individualized and largely affects health outcomes of patients depending on their adaptation to specific situations. It is applicable to this research study because {{it is based on the}} theory that psychological state, physical health, and social functioning among individuals, especially adolescents, are impacted by their coping strategies (Seiffge-Krenke, Aunola, & Nurmi, 2009). Through open-ended interviews, participants were asked the following question;"Tell me what <b>it</b> was <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> to have weight problems when you were an adolescent?"

The purpose of this phenome-nological study was to describe the experience of staff physical thera-pists during a time of systemic change within a large urban academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. Participants were 5 physical therapists working in various clinical settings within the medical center. The participants were interviewed and asked the question “Over the past 4 years, there have been major changes in your work environment. What has <b>it</b> been <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> working as a clinician during this time of change? ” Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and analyzed to find thematic patterns of responses. Results. Four common themes emerged in which participants described experienc-ing loss of control, stress, discontent, and disheartenment. A fifth theme showed that despite these negative feelings, participants were able to “find the silver lining ” in their daily work lives (ie, they were able to find positive aspects of their professional lives despite the perceived unpleasant changes with which they had to cope). Discussion and Conclusion. This study provides insight into the experiences of a group of staff physical therapists during a time of systemic change in their work environment. Although the themes reflect largely unsettling and negative experiences, there seems to be an underlying ability to find affirmative aspects of work. [Blau R, Bolus S, Carolan T, et al.

" The informants were three female spouses who had experienced critical care as the spouse of a critically ill male patient within the past year. Once verbal consent was obtained, written consent was obtained by sending a letter explaining the study, along with a consent form describing the risks and the benefits. Data were collected by means of tape-recorded unstructured forty-five minute interview. The study was strictly voluntary and all tape-recorded data collected were identified by numbers only and destroyed at the completion of the study. The informant was asked the question, "Tell me what <b>it</b> was <b>like</b> <b>for</b> <b>you</b> when your husband was critically ill?" Data were analyzed via the hermaneutical process of Heidegger as outlined by Giorgi. Each informant was provided the opportunity to reflect and recall this lived experience. The informants shared seven common themes even though each experience was individually unique and separate. The seven themes that emerged were (a) fear, (b) educational needs, (c) self-sacrifice, (d) center of focus shift, (e) family event, (f) the need to discuss system contact and, (g) tomorrow. The themes suggest that closure has not occurred for the spouse of the critically ill person. The findings indicate that the event {{is not limited to the}} initial hospitalization, but that long term changes and perceptions are apparent from the informants' perspectives.
