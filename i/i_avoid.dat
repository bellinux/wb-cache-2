500|$|Nixon did not sport the {{outrageous}} fashions of the 1970s, {{because she was}} concerned about appearing conservatively dressed, especially as her husband's political star rose. [...] "Always before, {{it was sort of}} fun to get some... thing that was completely different, high-style", she told a reporter. [...] "But this is not appropriate now. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> the spectacular." ...|$|E
500|$|All of Wollstonecraft's writings, {{including}} the Letters Written in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark, address {{the concerns of}} women in eighteenth-century society. As in previous works, she discusses concrete issues such as childcare and relationships with servants, but unlike her more polemical books such as Thoughts on the Education of Daughters (1787) or the Rights of Woman, this text emphasizes her emotional reactions to nature and maternity. Yet she does not depart from her interest in promoting women's education and rights. In Letter 19, the most explicitly feminist letter, Wollstonecraft anticipates readers' criticisms: [...] "still harping on the same subject, you will exclaim – How can <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> it, {{when most of the}} struggles of an eventful life have been occasioned by the oppressed state of my sex: we reason deeply, when we forcibly feel." [...] Wollstonecraft comes to the realization that she has always been forced to experience the world as a woman—it is the defining feature of her sense of self.|$|E
2500|$|... "The real {{difference}} is that <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> [...] division into two parts ... and give a homogeneous presentation of the lot. [...] In Boole the two parts run alongside one another, so that one is like the {{mirror image of the}} other, but for that very reason stands in no organic relation to it' ...|$|E
6000|$|Then I am {{out on the}} moors. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> the crests {{where the}} bonfires were being piled, and sought the lonely places. [...] .|$|R
60|$|As I made my {{way through}} the grounds I saw Audrey in the distance, walking with the Nugget. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> them and went on into the house.|$|R
60|$|For full {{two days}} thereafter, {{for no reason}} that I could clearly give, <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> her, and save at table and in her husband's {{presence}} we were never once together.|$|R
2500|$|With {{his first}} wife Anne Cook he had three children. In 1972 he married for a second time, this time to Griselda Greaves, a teacher and critic {{with whom he had}} two children. In a 2014 {{interview}} conducted with Mike Pitts for British Archaeology magazine, Garner stated that [...] "I don't {{have anything to do with}} the literary world. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> writers. I don't like them. Most of my close personal friends are professional archaeologists." ...|$|E
2500|$|Donald Knuth, {{who said}} of Edsger Dijkstra that [...] "to think of {{programming}} in C++" [...] "would make him physically ill", corroborates Thompson: [...] The problem that I have with them today is that... C++ is too complicated. At the moment, it's {{impossible for me}} to write portable code that I believe would work on lots of different systems, unless <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> all exotic features. Whenever the C++ language designers had two competing ideas as to how they should solve some problem, they said [...] "OK, we'll do them both". So the language is too baroque for my taste.|$|E
6000|$|... "Briefly, then. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> pine-trees, high houses, lonely barns, upland pastures, running water, {{flocks of}} cattle and sheep, {{a crowd of}} men. If I travel on foot--as to-day--I do not walk fast; if in my buggy, I touch not its back or sides; if on horseback, I {{dismount}} and lead the horse. But of all things, <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> tall men." ...|$|E
5000|$|When Higginson asked Emily Dickinson {{whether she}} had read Spofford's work [...] "Circumstance", Dickinson replied, [...] "I read Miss Prescott's 'Circumstance,' but it {{followed}} me in the dark, so <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> her." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> {{the turn}} by Braster Grange and went {{straight}} on to the village. Coming out of the post office I found myself {{face to face with}} Blanche Moyat. She held out her hand eagerly.|$|R
60|$|Wood. I am {{glad you}} did; for {{you could not}} but observe, with how much care <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> all {{occasions}} of railing at you; to which she urged me, like a malicious woman, as she was.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Bless the child! why didn't {{she come}} and call? I'd have let her in; though usually <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> stage-struck girls as I do reporters,' laughed Miss Cameron.|$|E

60|$|This from Radbourne was {{not only}} comforting; it was relief, hope, assurance. <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> Spears, for it would hardly be {{possible}} for him to regard the Rube favorably, and I kept under cover until time to show up at the grounds.|$|R
6000|$|... "Certainly I {{will tell}} you. There {{is an old}} {{friendship}} and cousinship between us; {{but we are not}} engaged, nor at all likely to be. I tell you so because, if <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> the question, you would draw the opposite and false conclusion." ...|$|R
60|$|Scaring {{eavesdropping}} boots croppy bootsboy Bloom in the Ormond hallway {{heard the}} growls and roars of bravo, fat backslapping, their boots all treading, boots not the boots the boy. General chorus {{off for a}} swill to wash it down. Glad <b>I</b> <b>avoided.</b>|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> {{my uncle}} with success, and I see 'er about {{the hour of}} dejeuner. She is talking to old gentleman. I have bowed. She have smiled and motioned me to approach.|$|E
6000|$|... "To be {{laughed at}} by my brethren, Freydisa? Moreover, you are foolish, for if evil is to be, how can <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> it? Either your {{foresight}} is nothing or the evil must come." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{will forget}} me soon. He will, at any rate, forget his love, {{when he finds}} that <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> his company; but, Henri, if he {{formally}} asks my hand, and is refused, that he will neither forget nor forgive." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Stop a moment, Cora. I do {{not know}} how it may be yet. But this I know, that if without cowardice <b>I</b> could <b>avoid</b> this task, <b>I</b> would {{certainly}} <b>avoid</b> it." ...|$|R
60|$|So, in {{the days}} that followed, I scarce knew myself. For a while (I shame to write it) <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> that sweet woman who had made my comfort her care, whose father had taken me when I was homeless. The good in me cried out, but the flesh rebelled.|$|R
60|$|STEPHEN: (Swaying) <b>I</b> don't <b>avoid</b> it. He provokes my intelligence.|$|R

60|$|Cleo. Slave, thou deservest it,-- Not that I fear my lord, will <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> him; I {{know him}} noble: when he banished me, And thought me false, he scorned {{to take my}} life; But I'll be justified, and then die with him.|$|E
6000|$|... "You dined there!" [...] exclaimed St. Barbe. [...] "It is very odd, {{they have}} never asked me. Not that I would have {{accepted}} their invitation. <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> parvenus. They are too fidgety for my taste. I require repose, and only dine with the old nobility." ...|$|E
5000|$|Esther interviewed famous {{bands like}} The Replacements, They Might Be Giants, Minor Threat, Social Distortion, Sham 69, Laurie Anderson, and Das Damen. Bell has joked, [...] "As a girl, the {{conventional}} gig {{was to be}} a groupie, but <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> all that crap by interviewing the bands and putting them in my magazine." ...|$|R
60|$|She {{wiped her}} eyes with {{the corner of her}} apron, dropped me a curtsey, and withdrew. Feurgéres came in presently, and <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> looking at him for the first few minutes. To tell the truth, there was a lump in my own throat. When he spoke, however, his tone was as usual.|$|R
60|$|He declined. This lack of {{confidence}} on his part created a coldness between us, and from that time forward <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> him. It was my idea, in case anything happened to me, to so time the occurrence as to throw my custom {{into the hands of}} the opposition coroner on the American side.|$|R
60|$|These Things, however {{intended}} for Terror, are indeed so ridiculous, that the Devil himself, to be sure, mocks at them, and a Man of Sense can hardly refrain doing the like, only <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> it, because I {{would not give}} offence to weaker Heads.|$|E

60|$|For six letters (adding h, as <b>I</b> <b>avoid</b> tailed letters) I {{substitute}} upright crosses for the oblique partitions, assigning the 4 portions, {{into which}} {{each of the}} 16 Cells is thus divided, to the four Classes eh, eh', e'h, e'h'. We have now got 64 Cells.|$|E
60|$|I {{sat down}} on the grass in front of her, feeling as I did so that the change of {{position}} in a manner clipped my wings. It is difficult to speak movingly while sitting on the ground. Instinctively <b>I</b> <b>avoided</b> eloquence. Standing up, I might have been pathetic and pleading. Sitting down, I was compelled to be matter-of-fact.|$|R
60|$|Sir John. How happy a man shall I be, if I can but compass this! {{and what}} a precipice have <b>I</b> <b>avoided!</b> then the revenge, too, is so sweet, to steal a wife under her father's nose, and leave 'em in the lurch, who have abused me; well, such a servant as this Warner is a jewel.|$|R
60|$|But {{those words}} of his put {{something}} new into my head. Could we not decide the matter in some better way than fighting?
