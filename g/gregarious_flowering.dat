5000|$|Certain {{species of}} {{unrelated}} families of flowering plants (including Poaceae, Arecaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Fabaceae, Apocynaceae, and Acanthaceae) are plietesial. The term plietesial {{has been used}} in reference to perennial monocarpic plants “of the kind most often met with in the Strobilanthinae” (a subtribe of Acanthaceae containing Strobilanthes and allied genera) that usually grow gregariously, flower simultaneously following a long interval, set seed, and die.

40|$|The {{flowering}} {{periods of}} woody bamboos, seed set, natural regeneration and death after flowering have been rarely observed and evaluated in the field. Dendrocalamus membranaceus Munro, a tropical woody bamboo mainly {{distributed in the}} Yunnan, displayed both sporadic as well as <b>gregarious</b> (mass) <b>flowering</b> and fruited from 2006 to 2013 following severe droughts. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine potential differences in seed set and natural regeneration between the two flowering patterns in natural D. membranaceus forests. We investigated and analyzed seed set, seed germination, seedling growth and mortality in both mass and sporadic flowering populations. Observations were made over a period of three years to record changes in bamboo seedling density, height and culm diameter. We observed a low natural seed set ranging from 1. 76 % to 7. 49 %, and a relatively high seed germination rate in the nursery from 59. 6 % to 71. 0 % for both types of flowering populations. Seeds germinated in 5 - 7 days after sowing and the germination period lasted 10 - 15 days. Seed set and germination rates in mass-flowering populations were significantly higher than those of sporadically flowering stands. The seedlings within sporadically flowering populations died within two years. In comparison, seedling mortality in the mass flowering population increased over two periods of observation from 64. 92 % to 98. 89 %, yet there was good seedling establishment left over, which showed mean height and mean culm diameter increasing by 1053. 25 % and 410. 71 %, respectively, in the second year of observations, and 137. 10 %, and 217. 48 %, respectively, in the third year. There are significant differences in seed set, natural regeneration ability and sustainability of bamboo populations between the mass flowering and sporadically flowering populations of D. membranaceus. Sporadic flowering populations failed to produce effective regeneration, while mass flowering populations were able to regenerate successfully. This study provides useful insights for conservation and natural forest management of D. membranaceus. We consider the merits of introducing other genetic provenances towards long-term maintenance of the stand features at sporadically flowering sites; meanwhile, the most economic option for mass flowering stands is to allow natural regeneration to take place through protecting such sites from further disturbance...|$|R
50|$|Blooming {{periods of}} {{different}} species of Kurinji differ from each other. Plants that bloom at long intervals like Strobilanthes kunthianus are known as plietesials.

50|$|Oxytenanthera abyssinica is a drought-resistant {{species of}} bamboo that grows in savanna woodland, {{semi-arid}} wooded grassland and thicket. It mass-flowers (<b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering)</b> after {{long periods of}} vegetative growth of more than 70 years before occasionally sets seed. The seed of Oxytenanthera abyssinic is considered rare. After setting seed the parent plant dies back, sometimes synchronously across large areas.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{characteristics of}} the dominant tree species in the tropical rain forest mainly belonging to dipterocarps {{as well as the}} environmental conditions especially for the light in the forest were studied to establish the silvicultural system for the forest regeneration in the tropical South Asia. The flowering patterns of the dipterocarp trees are usually irregular and unpredictable, which make difficult to collect sufficient seeds for raising the seedlings. The field survey revealed the diverged features of the so-called <b>gregarious</b> or simultaneous <b>flowering</b> of various species of this group. Appropriate conditions and methods for the storage of the seeds were established according to the detailed analyses of the morphological and physiological {{characteristics of the}} seeds such as the low temperature tolerance and the moisture contents. The intensity and spectra of the light in the forest primarily determine the growth and the morphological development of the seedlings under the canopy. Based on the measurements of the diffused light at the sites in the tropical forest in the varying sunlight, the parameters such as “the steady state of the diffuse light” and “the turning point” were defined, which were useful to evaluate the light conditions in the forest. To improve the survival of the transplanted seedlings, a planting method of “the bare-root seedlings”, the seedlings easy to be handled by removal of all leaves, soil and pots, was developed. Its marked efficiency was proved with various dipterocarps and other tropical trees by the field trial in the practical scale. Tolerance of the various species to the extreme environmental conditions such as fires, acid soils and drought were examined by the experiments and the field survey, which revealed marked adaptability of Shorea roxburghii as a potential species for regeneration of the tropical forests...|$|R
50|$|Lateral {{branches}} are dendroid. Sheaths {{are covered}} in appressed, dark brown hairs when young. Leaves are 10-35 x 2·5-6 cm., lanceolate to oblong-lanceolate, and obscurely tessellate. Leaf-blade apex is acuminate, while the base is broadly rounded, with a small petiole-like connection to the sheath. Leaf-blades are deciduous at the ligule. Culm-internodes are hollow and 5-10 cm. in diameter. Flowering patterns seem to be erratic, with <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> recorded in the Shire Highlands of Malawi, and annual flowering in the Usambara Mountains of Tanzania.

5000|$|Since {{the time}} of Mahabharata, people in several regions of India have {{associated}} spikes in rat populations and famine with bamboo flowering. The northeastern state of Mizoram has bamboo as a dominant species {{over much of the}} state which experiences a cyclical phenomenon of bamboo flowering followed by bamboo death. The bamboo plants are known to undergo <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> once in their life cycle which can happen anywhere in a range of 7 to 120 years. A common local belief and observation is that bamboo flowering is followed by an increase in rats, famine and unrest amongst the people. The first such event in the Republic of India was reported in 1958 when the local Mizo District Council cautioned the Assam government of an impending famine which the government rejected {{on the grounds that it}} was not scientific. A famine did occur in the region in 1961.|$|E
5000|$|Many bamboo species only flower at {{intervals}} {{as long as}} 65 or 120 years.

In this species, all plants of the same stock flower at the same time, regardless of differences in geographic locations or climatic conditions, and then die. The lack of environmental impact on the time of flowering indicates the presence of some sort of [...] "alarm clock" [...] in each cell of the plant which signals the diversion of all energy to flower production and the cessation of vegetative growth.

5000|$|A plietesial {{life history}} {{has long been}} noted for certain species among {{unrelated}} families of flowering plants including Poaceae, Arecaceae, Scrophulariaceae, Fabaceae, Apocynaceae, and Acanthaceae. Bremekamp used the term plietesial in reference to perennial monocarpic plants “of the kind most often met with in the Strobilanthinae” (a subtribe of Acanthaceae containing Strobilanthes and allied genera) that usually grow gregariously, flower simultaneously following an interval of several years, set seed, and die. A similar life history is especially well known and documented among certain bamboos. In plietesials, the seed crop typically germinates simultaneously shortly following the mass death of the parental plants and initiates a new cycle with the same periodicity. Other commonly used expressions that apply to part {{or all of the}} plietesial life history include: <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering,</b> mast seeding, and supra-annual synchronized semelparity (semelparity = monocarpy).There is considerable variation in life history for Strobilanthes. [...] Most known plietesial Strobilanthes take between 10 and 15 years (usually 12; although reports of 5 to 9 year cycles also have been made) to flower gregariously, set seed, and die. The flowering periodicity in all individuals is rarely 100%, with the result that flowering of rare individuals in non-mass-flowering years is not uncommon. In some species, mass flowering occurs over a wide area on a species-specific cycle; in other species, populations in different regions follow their own cycles. Some species flower gregariously in certain years but do not die following the mass flowering, and are therefore not plietesial. At least one species exhibits different flowering patterns in different portions of its range. The perennial Strobilanthes wallichii flowers annually in the eastern Himalayan portion of its range and plietesially in the western Himalayan portion (Wood 1994). Literature reports of life history for some taxa are ambiguous. For example, Robinson (1935) noted a 12 year plietesial cycle for S. consanguineus C.B. Clarke whereas Bowden (1950) indicated that this species flowers every year. Such discrepancies likely result either from misidentifications of or life history variations within taxa.

30|$|Seeding in bamboo is very {{irregular}} and {{unavailable for}} most of the species (Arya et al. 2002; Ntirugulirwa et al. 2012). Bamboo flowers gregariously or sporadically after long intervals to produce seeds. In <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering,</b> the entire local populations of the individual species die after flowering (Dwivedi 1988). However, in sporadic flowering, only a minority of culms (the hollow main axes of upright shoots) in clumps produce flowers and die. Sporadic flowering is reported in B. balcooa, B. nutans, B. vulgaris and B. longispiculata while <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> is reported in B. tulda, B. bambos, B. polymorpha, Dendrocalamus longispathus, D. strictus and Oxytenanthera nigrociliata (Banik 1985). Some species do not even produce seed (e.g. Bambusa balcooa, B. vulgaris), and those that do so often flower at long intervals varying from 30 to 70  years (e.g. Bambusa bambos, B. polymorpha, Dendrocalamus strictus, Melocanna baccifea and Phyllostachys spp.). Therefore, availability of seed may only be after long time intervals, seed viability may be poor and brief, storage facilities suitable for seed may be lacking, highly heterogeneous seedling populations may occur, and often overall poor seed set and consumption of seed by wild animals are the major problems with seed-based propagation (Singh et al. 2013). Seed-based propagation methods, therefore, cannot be relied for mass multiplication on a sustainable basis, so there is strong need to explore the possibility of vegetative propagation for mass multiplication of bamboo.|$|E

The wave of flowering has steadily moved southward through the region each year, with seed masting still occurring {{in some areas of}} the CHT during 2010. Because of a lack of surveillance, it is not yet known whether all Melocanna bamboo forests across the region have now initiated flowering.

40|$|Strobilanthes kunthianus (Acanthaceae) is a semelparous {{species with}} {{synchronized}} flowering and mast seeding once in 12 years. As semelparous plants {{have only one}} chance to reproduce, {{they are expected to}} develop effective strategies to prevent reproductive failure. The reproductive strategies of S. kunthianus were investigated by studying the floral traits, pollination biology, and breeding system that are critical for reproductive success. The species exhibits a series of floral traits: (1) <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> attracts a large number of Apis cerana indica, the major pollinator; (2) the stigma is sensitive to touch by the pollinator; in fresh flowers, the receptive surface faces the entry path of the incoming bee, facilitating pollen deposition; as an immediate response, the stigma curves backwards moving the receptive surface away from the path of the exiting bee, thus preventing autogamy and interference in pollen transfer; (3) flowers remain fresh for 2 days with receptive stigma and nectar and pollen reward. These traits render the species 100...|$|E
40|$|Eriolaena lushingtonii is an endemic and {{threatened}} medium-sized deciduous tree species. The flowering is very brief and occurs {{during the early}} wet season. The flowers are solitary, remain within the foliage and attract a few bee foragers only {{in the presence of}} nectariferous and polleniferous plants such as Holarrhena pubescens, Grewia tiliaefolia and Orthosiphon rubicundus which are common, exhibit <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> and attract a wide array of insects. In E. lushingtonii, the floral characteristics suggest entomophily but it is exclusively melittophilous involving Apis, Trigona and Xylocopa bees in the study area. The hermaphroditic flowers with the stigmatose style beyond the height of stamens and the sticky pollen grains do not facilitate autogamy but promote out-crossing. The study showed that pollinator limitation is responsible for the low fruit set but it is, however, compensated by multi-seeded fruits. Anther predation by a beetle also affects the reproductive success. Explosive fruit dehiscence and anemochory are special characteristics but these events are not effective during the wet season. The locals exploit the plant for treating snake bites, scorpion sting, making ropes and fuel wood. Therefore, the pollinator limitation, ineffective anemochory, seedling establishment problems and local uses largely contribute to the endemic and endangered status of E. lushingtonii...|$|E
40|$|<b>Gregarious</b> <b>flowering</b> {{of bamboo}} species impacts {{ecosystem}} properties and conservation, but documentation of these periodic events is difficult. Here, we compare {{the characteristics of}} flowering sites and un-flowered patches of an arrow bamboo (Fargesia qinlingensis) in the Qinling Mountains, China, {{over a five-year period}} (2003 - 2007) after a mast flowering event (2003). We examined flowering culm and seedling characteristics in relation to questions regarding the evolution of delayed flowering. Density of live culms decreased over the five years in both flowering sites and un-flowered patches. New shoots regenerated only in un-flowered patches. Chemical constituent allocation varied among culm parts (stems, branches, and leaves). Crude protein and extract ether in branches and leaves were less in flowering culms than in un-flowered culms. Seedling density was lower than expected based on floret counts, suggesting predation of seeds. Seedling density was significantly greater in flowering sites than in un-flowered patches and decreased over time. Seedlings performed better in flowering sites than in un-flowered patches based on their height, leaf number per seedling, and average leaf length, while fertilization on flowering sites had no significant effect on seedling growth, suggesting a saturation of resources. This study suggested that the characteristics of bamboos and bamboo stands were dramatically altered during this flowering event, enhancing seedling establishment and growth, and supporting mostly the habitat modification hypothesis of delayed reproduction...|$|E
40|$|Bamboos are an {{important}} member of the subfamily Bambusoideae, family Poaceae. The plant group exhibits wide variation {{with respect to the}} timing (1 - 120 years) and nature (sporadic vs. gregarious) of flowering among species. Usually flowering in woody bamboos is synchronous across culms growing over a large area, known as <b>gregarious</b> <b>flowering.</b> In many monocarpic bamboos this is followed by mass death and seed setting. While in sporadic flowering an isolated wild clump may flower, set little or no seed and remain alive. Such wide variation in flowering time and extent means that the plant group serves as repositories for genes and expression patterns that are unique to bamboo. Due to the dearth of available genomic and transcriptomic resources, limited studies have been undertaken to identify the potential molecular players in bamboo flowering. The public release of the first bamboo genome sequence Phyllostachys heterocycla, availability of related genomes Brachypodium distachyon and Oryza sativa provide us the opportunity to study this long-standing biological problem in a comparative and functional genomics framework. We identified bamboo genes homologous to those of Oryza and Brachypodium that are involved in established pathways such as vernalization, photoperiod, autonomous and hormonal regulation of flowering. Additionally, we investigated triggers like stress (drought), physiological maturity and micro RNAs that may play crucial roles in flowering. We also analyzed available transcriptome datasets of different bamboo species to identify genes and their involvement in bamboo flowering.
