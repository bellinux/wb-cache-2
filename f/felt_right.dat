5|$|Absolutely. There's a {{song called}} 'Army of Me,' {{which is sort of}} a 'Fighter 2.0.' There is a new {{generation}} of fans from a younger demographic that might not have been with me all the way but that watch me on the show now. I feel like every generation should be able to enjoy and have their piece of 'Fighter' within. This time, the way it musically came together it just <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> for this time and this generation. There's {{always going to be a}} fighter in me getting through some obstacle and some hurdle. All these 6-year-olds who know me from pushing my button and turning around in a big red chair who weren't around for the actual 'Fighter,' this is my chance to recharge it, rejuvenate it and do something modernized for them.|$|E
500|$|At {{the end of}} the episode, Tomarken asked Larson why {{he decided}} not to pass his {{remaining}} spins before he did, considering the lead he rapidly gained over Litras and Long. Side-stepping revealing how he had won the game, Larson responded with, [...] "Two things: one, it <b>felt</b> <b>right,</b> and second, I still had seven spins and if I passed them, somebody could've done what I did." ...|$|E
500|$|Appearing on Nikita {{would be}} Q's first {{television}} role. During {{an interview with}} IGN, Q explained {{that she had not}} been on television before [...] "not because I didn't want to. I just never thought about it," [...] adding [...] "When this came up, everything just <b>felt</b> <b>right.</b> I knew McG and when Wonderland came on he was like, 'This is you, we're not doing this without you.' and I went 'That's very sweet!' So it felt right." ...|$|E

Although the band has changed, we’ve lost Layne, we’ve added Will, {{and there was no}} master plan. Playing again in 2005 <b>felt</b> <b>right,</b> so we did the next thing and toured. We did it step by step. It’s more than just making music, and it always has been. We’ve been friends a long time. We’ve been more of a family than most, and it had to be okay from here", Cantrell said pointing to his heart.|$|E
500|$|Parker held casting {{calls in}} New York, Atlanta, Houston, Dallas, Orlando, New Orleans, Raleigh and Nashville. The filmmakers did not retain {{the names of}} actual people; many of the {{supporting}} characters were composites of people related to the murder case. Gene Hackman plays Rupert Anderson, an FBI agent and former Mississippi sheriff. Brian Dennehy was briefly considered for the role before Orion suggested Hackman. During the screenwriting process, Parker frequently discussed the project with Hackman. Hackman said, [...] "...it <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> to do something of historical import. It was an extremely intense experience, both {{the content of the}} film and the making of it in Mississippi." ...|$|E
500|$|In a {{reference}} to the Palestinian leadership, Chairman of the Palestine Liberation Organization Yasser Arafat is mentioned by name. Even though foreign dignitaries were normally fictional on the show, producer Aaron Sorkin said it <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> to call the Chairman by his real name [...] "'cause Arafat's been around forever and he'll be around forever". In a later episode, however ("Gaza" [...] in season five), the name of the Chairman of the Palestinian Authority was changed to Nizar Farad, a fictional character. By that point in mid-2004, Arafat was in failing health in real life, and would die in November 2004. The show continued to use the Farad character and never made any references to Arafat's successor Mahmoud Abbas.|$|E

500|$|Leigh first {{appeared}} on the show {{during the last two}} episodes of the third season as Meredith's half-sister, Lexie Grey. Following Isaiah Washington's departure who portrayed Preston Burke, it was reported that show's executives were planning on adding new cast members, such as Lexie. She was officially upgraded to a series' regular on July 11, 2007, for the fourth season. On casting Chyler Leigh as Lexie, Grey's Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes said: [...] "We met with a lot of young actresses, but Chyler stood out—she had a quality that <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> and real to me. It felt like she could be Meredith's sister, but she had a depth that was very interesting." ...|$|E
500|$|In 2006, he {{made his}} Broadway debut in Herman Wouk's two-act play The Caine Mutiny Court-Martial. Schwimmer {{played the role of}} Lieutenant Barney Greenwald in the production, which was {{directed}} by Jerry Zaks. In an interview with New York magazine, he revealed that he had wanted to try Broadway, however said [...] "a couple of things came up that just never quite <b>felt</b> <b>right.</b> Either because I liked the play but wasn’t hot on the director, or there was another star attached that I wasn't jazzed about working with". He further added that when showed a copy of Wouk's novel [...] "...I was shocked at how good the writing was". His next film role was in the 2006 black comedy Big Nothing, in which he played a bitter, unemployed scientist.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive {{reviews from}} television critics. Eric Goldman of IGN graded the episode an 8.3 out of 10, indicating {{that it was}} [...] "great". He thought that the finale did not resolve every plot line {{by the end of}} the episode. However, he did not blame the writers, because they were not planning for the episode to be a series finale. He enjoyed the final scene between Logan, Veronica, and Piz because of the variety of different ways in which it could be interpreted. While he expressed some frustration over Keith's criminal charges and the ambiguity regarding the outcome of the sheriff's election, he opined that one could still take away important messages from the show because of Keith's actions in the episode. The reviewer also lauded the final scene, writing that [...] "the melancholy feeling of the final scene – with Veronica walking through the rain, having cast a vote for her dad that is probably meaningless – <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> for the series".|$|E
5000|$|Bourdais {{commented on}} his retirement: [...] "Something broke {{at the back}} of the car... Going into Turn 12, I braked at the usual point and the car went sideways, I <b>felt</b> the <b>right</b> rear corner of the car drop and it spun me round." ...|$|R

500|$|Till {{signed a}} one-year {{contract}} with Conference Premier club York City on 29 June 2010 and following the move he said [...] "I spoke {{to a number of}} clubs but this <b>felt</b> <b>right.</b> The gaffer made me feel really wanted so that was a key decision in coming". He made his debut in the opening game of the 2010–11 season as a 38th-minute substitute for Levi Mackin in a 2–1 defeat to Kidderminster Harriers on 14 August 2010. His first goal for York came in his next appearance after he scored the equaliser in a 2–2 draw at Bath City on 21 August 2010 after entering the game as a 74th-minute substitute. Till made his first start in a 3–0 victory against Altrincham on 28 August 2010 and he was substituted in the 82nd minute. He scored his first home goal with the opener as York beat Rushden & Diamonds 2–0 on 4 September 2010. He finished the season with 45 appearances and four goals.|$|E
500|$|Eric Goldman of IGN {{scored the}} season a 7.9 out of 10, feeling it [...] "had its up and downs, mixing in {{elements}} that worked (Daisy getting her Quake on, the Fitz and Simmons drama), elements {{we could have}} used more of (Secret Warriors!) and elements that just never <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> (Lincoln and his relationship with Daisy)." [...] Goldman also felt that {{the first half of}} the season was [...] "the stronger, more cohesive of the two halves" [...] as it aired the episode [...] "4,722 Hours" [...] which Goldman called [...] "the best hour of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. to date." [...] He criticized the pacing of the season, saying [...] "some episodes felt a bit jumbled and could have benefited from slowing down a bit—or simply not trying to do so much at once. Sometimes it was just a question of including too many characters or storylines in single episodes, causing some scenarios to not have time to breathe or get the proper build up they might have with more character-focused episodes." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the Art for Freedom initiative, Madonna {{began work}} on her {{thirteen}}th studio album, collaborating with Avicii, Diplo and Kanye West, among others. In December 2014, thirteen demos recorded for the album leaked onto the Internet. She posted in response {{that half of the}} tracks would not be used on the final release, while the other half had [...] "changed and evolved". Titled Rebel Heart, the album was released in March 2015. Introspection was also listed as one of the foundational themes prevalent on the record, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> for Rebel Heart. Music critics responded positively towards the album, calling it her best effort in a decade. Rebel Heart became Madonna's first album to miss the top position of the Billboard 200 since Ray of Light, but it reached number one in other major music markets, including Australia, Canada, Germany and Italy.|$|E

500|$|At BlizzCon 2015, one {{questioner}} asked Metzen {{about the}} presence of gay heroes in the Overwatch universe; he confirmed that there were such characters, but elaborated, [...] "we want it to play out organically, we don't want it to be a data point or feel contrived in any way". In December 2016, Tracer became the first Overwatch hero to be canonically revealed as LGBT in Reflections, an issue of the Overwatch digital comic; she specifically identifies as a lesbian. In the comic, she is seen in a romantic relationship with Emily, a woman who {{is not part of the}} Overwatch team. Of this reveal, Blizzard stated, [...] "as in real life, having variety in our characters and their identities and backgrounds helps create a richer and deeper overall fictional universe". About Tracer's development specifically, Blizzard stated, [...] "as with any aspect of our characters' backgrounds, their sexuality is just one part of what makes our heroes who they are. From the very beginning of our work on Tracer's story, it just <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> to make this an aspect of her character." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{ultimate}} {{revelation of}} Danielle's identity {{was set at}} Archie's wedding to Peggy (Barbara Windsor), matriarch of the Mitchell family. Crace deemed the wedding [...] "the perfect opportunity" [...] for the storyline to conclude, and Santer explained: [...] "Weddings are great because they bring the community together. A wedding gives you a stage, it gives you an event, the context to play things out, so it <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> that these big Mitchell stories would collide at Peggy's wedding." [...] Writer James Payne concurred that setting the reveal at the wedding helped to make the moment [...] "as dramatic and sensational" [...] as it could possibly be. The episode saw Danielle announce that she was Ronnie's daughter {{in front of the}} entire wedding reception party, in what Crace has named her favourite scene on the show. She opined that the disbelief Danielle was faced with was [...] "heartbreaking" [...] and served to highlight the fact that [...] "she came as the outsider and she still is the outsider because no one steps in to help her".|$|E
500|$|In a June 2011 Kerrang! interview, Lee {{said that}} the album would be self-titled and was [...] "about the band; it's more of a band record." [...] Lee {{explained}} that the concept [...] "to me is about falling back {{in love with this}} thing, with Evanescence, with what I've obsessed over for a decade, longer than that." [...] There were originally many album-title ideas, but Lee said that as the project became more collaborative [...] "it just felt like this is who we are, it's a band. And to have that feeling in the music where the band is so pumped up, it was just the only title that <b>felt</b> <b>right.</b> It's about falling back in love with this thing in a major way." [...] In an MTV News interview, she said that 16 songs had been recorded but not all would be included on the album. It was later decided to release two versions of the album: a deluxe edition with all 16 songs and a standard edition with 12.|$|E

500|$|Introspection {{was also}} listed {{as one of}} the {{foundational}} themes prevalent on the album, along with [...] "genuine statements of personal and careerist reflection scattered among the posturing of 'Bitch I'm Madonna' and 'Unapologetic Bitch'" [...] according to Slant Magazines Sam C. Mac as well as her [...] "obsessive self-regard". Madonna explained to Jon Pareles of The New York Times that although she has never looked back at her past endeavors, reminiscing about it <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> for Rebel Heart. [...] "And it's bittersweet for me to think about that. It just seemed like a time where I wanted to stop and look back. It's kind of like survivor guilt. How did I make it and they didn't?" [...] During the album's development phase, she became comfortable expressing her ideas in front of a few people, comparing it to: [...] "writing your diary in front of somebody and reading it out loud... It was almost like an acting exercise, you know, just putting myself in a room and letting ideas flow even if I didn't feel so connected to the people".|$|E
500|$|... "Love Story" [...] was {{recorded}} in March 2008 at Blackbird Studios in Nashville, Tennessee, alongside record producer Nathan Chapman and various personnel. Swift sang into an Avantone CV-12 multi-pattern tube microphone, manufactured by Avant Electronics. The microphone had a new old stock tube that was designed and built by country singer, record producer, and audio engineer Ray Kennedy for Chapman. Chapman had received the microphone from Kennedy as a loan, as a [...] "try this for a while" [...] experiment. Although he previously had tested numerous microphones on Swift, {{he had not been}} able to find one to match her voice perfectly. When Swift came to Chapman's home to record a radio edit for one of the singles from Taylor Swift, she immediately grew fond of the microphone. [...] "When she put on the headphones and said, 'Test,' completely unprompted, she said, 'This is my mic. I love this mic. I just wanna use this one from now on!' She had no idea what it was, just loved it, and I went along with something that <b>felt</b> <b>right</b> for her. We've been using it ever since, and it sounds great on her voice," [...] Chapman said.|$|E
