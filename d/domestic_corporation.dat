[...] It is not necessary to treat a corporation as a person in all circumstances. [...] United States case law is confusing concerning this matter when dealing with foreign corporations, and their operation within the United States. [...] Especially troubling have been rulings concerning the Fourth Amendment of the United States Constitution and Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution. [...] A foreign agent may not claim Fifth Amendment provisions against self-incrimination. Nor can records be withheld from subpoena duces tecum on the grounds that production of such documents would incriminate officers or other members of the foreign corporation. [...] However, there is case authority in which foreign corporations have been protected from illegal searches and seizures, including documents and books. [...] The matter of a foreign corporation operating as a [...] "person" [...] within the United States being afforded protection under the Fourteenth Amendment is discussed.|$|E

50|$|One {{reason for}} {{operating}} {{as a single}} corporation having foreign corporation status in other states is because of corporate governance rules which dictate that {{the rules of the}} state where the corporation is a <b>domestic</b> <b>corporation</b> apply for certain provisions such as voting rights, officer and director protection, and liability for misconduct. If a corporation is sued and is considered to have operated in a fraudulent manner such as essentially acting as the alter ego of the stockholders (especially {{in the case of a}} corporation having only one stockholder) the corporation's existence may be disregarded by the court. This is referred to as piercing the corporate veil, and is subject to the rules of the home state where the corporation is a <b>domestic</b> <b>corporation.</b> In the case of corporations domesticated in Nevada, for example, , over the last twenty years, only twice has the corporate veil been pierced, and in both cases the corporation's owners engaged in fraud.|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates {{corporate}} {{capital structure}} of multinational enterprises. Its core subject {{is focused on}} corporate capital structure defining factors that are specific for MNE rather than for <b>domestic</b> <b>corporations.</b> Substantial part of scientific literature concentrates on country specific and firm specific factors of corporate capital structure with most research devoted to <b>domestic</b> <b>corporations.</b> The main goal of our paper is to discover among plenty of corporate capital structure factors those that are specific for MNE {{and to develop a}} new approach for analyzing these factors in terms of financial resources demand and supply. There are some corporate capital structure factors that influence directly and some that have indirect influence while there is also another set of factors having both direct and indirect influence on indebtedness. Different theoretical and empirical research confirm different directions. Methodology of our study is based on analysis of two fundamental market driving forces that are demand and supply. Their influence on corporate capital structure is of a primary origin and that is why the suggested approach is to our mind theoretically significant and practically important. Demand factors imply that a corporation creates demand for financial resources and its capital structure is defined internally. Supply factors imply an external capital structure since it is created by external investors’ supply of financial resources. On empirical level, we use the primary data of corporate financial statements to analyze the leverage of MNE based in different countries and representing different industries. The key results of our study show that the main MNE specific factors of capital structure include such demand factors as multinationality level, assets tangibility and political risk. The first two are firm specific factors that can influence corporate capital structure either directly or indirectly according to different theories and empirical studies. Political risk is a country specific factor which affects MNE indebtedness level directly. Exchange rate risk is another factor of MNE capital structure substantial influence. It can be either demand or supply factor that brings mostly to indirect influence on corporate indebtedness level. These factors obviously affect <b>domestic</b> <b>corporations</b> capital structure as well but to a much lesser extent. We also consider a set of behavioral factors to be essential for MNEs though they also affect <b>domestic</b> <b>corporations...</b>|$|R
