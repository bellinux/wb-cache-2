40|$|Empty Sella Syndrome (ESS) may be {{asymptomatic}} or manifested as {{features of}} multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies. In a patient of suspected hypopituitarism, multiple pituitary hormonal axes {{should be tested}} to rule out concomitant hormones deficiencies. In <b>Hypopituitarism,</b> <b>treatment</b> of hypoadrenalism should be undertaken first before giving levothyroxine replacement to prevent adrenal insufficiency. Key Words: Hypopituitarism, adrenal insufficiency, ESS (Empty Sella Syndrome), Levothyroxine Overt primary hypothyroidism is easy to diagnose, but central hypothyroidism may be missed if the treating physician has low index of suspicion in some cases of subclinical hypothyroidism.

40|$|We {{report a}} case of choroidal neovascularization (CNV) {{secondary}} to methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) gene mutation in a 20 -year-old male patient with <b>hypopituitarism.</b> <b>Treatment</b> with three consecutive injections of intravitreal ranibizumab (anti-vascular endothelial growth factor) resulted in significant improvement of the patient′s vision {{and the appearance of}} the macula. A search of the literature produced no previously reported case of MTHFR gene mutation associated both CNV and possibly hypopituitarism. With hormone replacement therapy of hypopituitarism, acetyl salicylic acid 100 mg/day also was started. The patient was clinically stable both for CNV and other thromboembolic disorders over a 6 -month follow-up and also 1 -year follow-up period...|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{suggests}} {{that there may be}} drug interactions between antiepileptic drugs and hormonal therapies, which can present a challenge to endocrinologists dealing with patients who have both hypopituitarism and neurological diseases. Data are scarce for this subgroup of patients; however, data for the interaction of antiepileptic drugs with the pituitary axis have shown that chronic use of many antiepileptic drugs, such as carbamazepine, oxcarbazepine, and topiramate, enhances hepatic cytochrome P 450 3 A 4 (CYP 3 A 4) activity, and can decrease serum concentrations of sex hormones. Other antiepileptic drugs increase sex hormone-binding globulin, which reduces the bioactivity of testosterone and estradiol. Additionally, the combined oestrogen-progestagen contraceptive pill might decrease lamotrigine concentrations, which could worsen seizure control. Moreover, sex hormones and their metabolites can directly act on neuronal excitability, acting as neurosteroids. Because carbamazepine and oxcarbazepine can enhance the sensitivity of renal tubules, a reduction in desmopressin dose might be necessary in patients with central diabetes insipidus. Although the effects of antiepileptic drugs in central hypothyroidism have not yet been studied, substantial evidence indicates that several antiepileptic drugs can increase thyroid hormone metabolism. However, although it is reasonable to expect a need for a thyroxine dose increase with some antiepileptic drugs, the effect of excessive thyroxine in lowering seizure threshold should also be considered. There are no reports of significant interactions between antiepileptic drugs and the efficacy of human growth hormone therapy, and few data are available for the effects of second-generation antiepileptic drugs on <b>hypopituitarism</b> <b>treatment...</b>|$|E
40|$|A {{consecutive}} {{series of}} 35 clinically non-secretory pituitary adenomas treated surgically by the transethmodial approach is presented. Mean age at presentation was 60 years, with a male-to-female ratio of 2 : 1. These tumours present later than hormone secreting tumours: 90 % were over 2 cm in diameter at operation. Seventy-one per cent of patients had impaired vision and 89 % had <b>hypopituitarism.</b> Surgical <b>treatment</b> relieved or significantly improved visual fields in 79 % {{of patients with}} impaired vision. Ninety-one per cent required permanent hormone replacement. Mean follow-up was for 4. 4 years. Five tumours recurred, causing recurrent visual symptoms. No tumours recurred in those patients treated with postoperative radiotherapy, but follow-up in this group was only for a mean of 2. 7 years...|$|R
40|$|The use of {{filter paper}} four point 24 hour {{cortisol}} profiles {{in the diagnosis}} and management of secondary adrenocortical deficiency was examined. Eighteen children with familial short stature and isolated growth hormone deficiency had normal 24 hour and morning plasma cortisol concentrations measured. Eight of 11 children with multiple pituitary hormone deficiencies had evidence of hypocorticalism despite previously normal baseline cortisols or responses to insulin hypoglycaemia or tetracosactrin. Nine of 11 children with <b>hypopituitarism</b> on replacement <b>treatment</b> (4. 9 - 12. 5 mg/m 2 /day) had satisfactory concentrations of cortisol, though morning cortisols were often low. Filter paper profiles are a simple, inexpensive, and relatively non-invasive way of managing children with suspected hypocorticalism and of monitoring their treatment...|$|R
40|$|Traumatic {{brain injury}} and subarachnoid {{haemorrhage}} are important causes of {{morbidity and mortality}} in the developed world. There is a large body of evidence that demonstrates that both conditions may adversely affect pituitary function in both the acute and chronic phases of recovery. Diagnosis of <b>hypopituitarism</b> and accurate <b>treatment</b> of pituitary disorders offers the opportunity to improve mortality and outcome in both traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage. In this article, we will review the history and pathophysiology of pituitary function in the acute phase following traumatic brain injury and subarachnoid haemorrhage, and we will discuss in detail three key aspects of pituitary dysfunction which occur in the early course of TBI; acute cortisol deficiency, diabetes insipidus and SIAD...|$|R
40|$|Growth hormone (GH) regulates somatic growth, {{substrate}} {{metabolism and}} body composition. Sex hormones exert {{profound effect on}} the secretion and action of GH. Estrogens stimulate the secretion of GH, but inhibit the action of GH on the liver, an effect that occurs when administered orally. Estrogens suppress GH receptor signaling by stimulating the expression proteins that inhibit cytokine receptor signaling. This effect of estrogens is avoided when physiological doses of estrogens are administered via a non-oral route. Estrogen-like compounds, such as selective estrogen receptor modulators, possess dual properties of inhibiting the secretion as well as the action of GH. In contrast, androgens stimulate GH secretion, driving IGF- 1 production. In the periphery, androgens enhance the action of GH. The differential effects of estrogens and androgens influence the dose of GH replacement in patients with <b>hypopituitarism</b> on concomitant <b>treatment</b> with sex steroids. Where possible, a non-oral route of estrogen replacement is recommended for optimizing cost-benefit of GH replacement in women with GH deficiency. Adequate androgen replacement in conjunction with GH replacement is required to achieve the full anabolic effect in men with hypopituitarism...|$|R
40|$|Non-functioning {{pituitary}} tumours, i. e. non-functioning pituitary adenomas (NFPA) and craniopharyngiomas (CP), are histologically benign brain tumours. They are, however, {{associated with}} hypopituitarism, diabetes insipidus {{and other local}} symptoms caused by the tumour itself or its treatment. Previous studies have shown an excess mortality in patient populations with hypopituitarism, caused by various aetiologies. The mortality rates and factors predicting the mortality in NFPA and CP patients are largely unknown. Modern replacement therapy for patients with <b>hypopituitarism</b> includes <b>treatment</b> with growth hormone (GH) replacement therapy (GHRT). GH has known mitogenic effects, and is considered to possibly {{increase the risk of}} tumour progression in patients with a history of pituitary tumours. This thesis is based on four studies aimed to investigate whether GHRT influences the risk of tumour progression and to study mortality and morbidity in patients with NFPA or CP. In two case-control studies the frequency of tumour progression was investigated in patients with NFPA or CP treated with and without GHRT. The 10 -year tumour progression free survival rate in NFPA patients with and without GHRT was 74 % and 70 %, respectively. The corresponding figures for CP patients were 88 % and 57 %. In a population-based registry-study of 2795 NFPA patients an excess mortality was demonstrated in women and in patients diagnosed at or before 40 years of age. In another population-based registry-study of 307 CP patients, mortality and morbidity were highly increased, especially in patients with a childhood-onset of the disease. The incidences of type 2 diabetes mellitus, cerebral infarction and severe infection were 5 -fold elevated compared to the general population. In conclusion, GHRT does not affect the frequency of tumour progression in patients with NFPA or CP. Furthermore, there is an increased mortality in women and young patients with NFPA and an excess mortality in CP patients, especially in patients with childhoodonset of CP...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Langerhans-cell {{histiocytosis}} (LCH) is a {{rare disease}} with features of chronic inflammation and it may also induce hypopituitarism, conditions {{associated with an increased}} risk of cardiovascular diseases. AIM: Cardiovascular and metabolic risk profile investigation in multisystem LCH patients with and without anterior pituitary deficiency. DESIGN: Prospective, observational study. METHODS: Fourteen adult patients with LCH, 7 with and 7 without anterior pituitary deficiency, and 42 controls matched for age, body mass index (BMI) and smoking. Cardiovascular risk factors were estimated in all subjects: glucose and lipid profile, mathematical indices of insulin resistance (IR), blood pressure, structural arterial and functional endothelial properties (intima-media thickness, brachial artery flow-mediated dilatation). Cardiovascular risk factors were estimated in the three groups studied; the effect of disease activity and/or treatment was also determined in patients with LCH. RESULTS: Ten patients had diabetes insipidus, and 7 anterior pituitary hormone deficiencies: 8 patients had active disease and 11 had received systemic treatment. No difference was observed between the study groups in vascular parameters, in lipid profile or in blood pressure. However, the insulin resistance index GIR was decreased in patients with LCH without anterior pituitary deficiency compared to controls (P = 0. 033). Three patients had impaired glucose tolerance and one diabetes mellitus type 2. These patients were older and had active disease; there was no association with <b>hypopituitarism</b> and/or previous <b>treatment.</b> CONCLUSION: Adults patients with LCH have abnormalities of glucose metabolism that tend to occur in patients with active disease, and may be a consequence of the pro-inflammatory state...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe aims of {{this study}} were to {{determine}} the prevalence of pituitary dysfunction in patients presenting with cognitive and/or mood complaints and/or fatigability late after a mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), and to analyse the relations of endocrine abnormalities with population characteristics, imagery and autonomy. MethodsWe studied 38 patients: 25 men, mean age 36 (range 21 – 60 years), at a mean of 23 months (range 9 – 40) post-event; 44. 7 % were GOS 1, 47. 4 % GOS 2 (moderate disability) and 7. 9 % GOS 3 (severe disability). 15 patients were active. For each patient, we collected data on initial CT scan, MRI lesions, late Glasgow Outcome Scale (GOS), autonomy (EBIS questionnaire) and pituitary functions (static and dynamic tests). ResultsNo patient showed any posterior pituitary dysfunction. One (2. 6 %) showed a hyperprolactinemia, two (5. 3 %) a gonadotropin deficiency, seven (18. 4 %) a TSH deficiency. Nine patients (23. 7 %) had partial ACTH deficiency (diagnosed by ITT or metyrapone test). Severe GH deficiency (GHD) was diagnosed in nine patients (23. 7 %) (ITT or arginine+GHRH test) and was isolated in 39 % of cases. Twenty-three patients (60. 5 %) showed at least one anterior pituitary deficiency requiring a substitutive <b>treatment.</b> <b>Hypopituitarism</b> was only related to age (positive correlation, P= 0. 01) and the presence of a cerebral oedema on initial CT scan (P= 0. 044). We didn’t find any association with autonomy in activities, GOS score and MRI data. ConclusionsIn mild TBI patients with persistent cognitive disorders, fatigability or mood disorder, the risk of anterior pituitary deficiency is high and justifies a systematic pituitary assessment with specific reference tests...|$|R
40|$|Background: Excess {{mortality}} due to de novo malignant {{brain tumors}} was recently {{found in a}} national study of patients with <b>hypopituitarism</b> following <b>treatment</b> of pituitary tumors. Here, we examined a larger multi-national cohort to corroborate and extend this observation. Objective: To investigate the incidence of malignant brain tumors and benign meningiomas in a large cohort of patients treated for pituitary tumors. Patients and Methods: Between 1994 - 2012, 8917 hypopituitary patients with a pituitary tumor treated with growth hormone (GH) replacement were followed in KIMS (non-interventional Pfizer International Metabolic Database). For 4936 patients, pituitary tumor treatment was surgery/medical therapy, and in 3227 radiotherapy (RT) was used alone or with surgery. For 754 patients, tumor treatment data were missing. Reference incidence rates of malignant brain tumors (ICD 10 : C 70 -C 72) stratified for age, gender and country (Cancer Incidence in 5 regions, Vol IX, IARC 2007) were used to calculate standardized incidence ratios (SIR). Risk indicators for 2 nd central nervous system neoplasia (new malignant brain tumors and benign meningiomas) were analyzed by multiple Poisson regression. Relative risks (RRs) were based on internal comparisons. Results: During 53, 881 patient-years at risk, 21 malignant brain tumors (SIR 3. 92 95 % CI: 2. 43 - 6. 00), and 27 benign meningiomas were reported. Fourteen malignant tumors occurred in patients treated with RT, SIR 6. 50 (95 % CI 3. 55 - 10. 91) vs 7 in those without RT. The RR of RT vs no RT for malignant brain tumors was 2. 43 (95 % CI 1. 02 - 6. 29), and for meningiomas was 5. 43 (95 % CI 2. 06 - 14. 35). On average, the risk for malignant brain tumors increased by 5. 9 % per year of decreasing age at first radiotherapy (95 % CI: 1. 2 % - 10. 3 %; p= 0. 01) and for meningiomas by 5. 7 % (95 % CI: 1. 6 % - 9. 6 %; p= 0. 003). Median times from RT exposure to 2 nd tumor diagnosis were 20. 3, range 3. 1 - 46. 1 yrs, and 22. 2, range 8. 1 - 39. 3 yrs, for malignant tumors and meningiomas, respectively. Meningiomas were more common in females (18 vs 9, RR= 2. 26, 95 % CI: 1. 01 - 5. 05), {{but there was no}} difference between genders for malignant brain tumors. The underlying pituitary tumor etiology, number of surgeries, and IGF-I SDS on GH treatment did not influence the risk of 2 nd tumors. Conclusion: Radiotherapy is associated with increased risk of developing malignant brain tumors and meningiomas, in particular when given at younger ages. In balancing risks and benefits of RT in the treatment of pituitary tumors, our findings emphasize that special consideration should be given to the age of the patient...|$|R
