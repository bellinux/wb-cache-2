30|$|Diesel (1986) used <b>gelification</b> index (GI) {{and tissue}} {{preservation}} index (TPI) for characterizing the paleomire of Permian coals of Australia. Less-humified structured and strongly-humified unstructured tissue-derived macerals reveal vegetation type {{and degree of}} humification (Diesel 1992). While a high subsidence rate of a basin is reflected by high TPI and wood-derived tissues, a low TPI is indicative of subsidence with enhanced humification due to dominating herbaceous vegetation in the mire. On the other hand, the degree of <b>gelification</b> of huminite macerals is indicated by GI which differentiates gelified macerals from the ungelified ones. A continuous presence of water is prerequisite for <b>gelification</b> and fluctuation in water table affects GI because during the periods of drier spells inertinites would form. Many researchers have used palynological and paleobotanical data which provides higher precision in the determination of paleoenvironment (Calder 1993; Collinson and Scott 1987). Moreover, several researchers made serious remarks for using these indices for low-rank coals (Lambersen et al. 1991; Crosdale 1993; Dehmer 1995; Wüst et al. 2001; Scott 2002 a, b; Moore and Shearer 2003; Amijaya and Littke 2005). As a result of this, few researchers used a combination of petrographic, organic geochemical, and/or isotope data to understand the environment of paleomire (Bechtel et al. 2002, 2003; Singh et al. 2013) while few researchers modified these indices for low-rank coals (Kalkreuth et al. 1991; Petersen 1993; Flores 2002).|$|E

40|$|The {{new method}} based on {{positron}} annihilation lifetime spectroscopy (PALS) to determine both the mean core radius, R_core, and aggregation number, N_ag, of micelles {{is applied to}} the study of aqueous solutions of the triblock Pluronic® P 84 copolymer as a function of temperature (T), beyond the <b>gelification</b> point (334 K). Two long-lived components appear in the PALS spectra, ascribed to triplet positronium in the water bulk (o-Ps^aq) and in the organic core of the micelles (o-Ps^org). Of the various fitting parameters, only the lifetime of the latter species, τ_ 4, and the micellar parameters, R_core and N_ag, disclose the occurrence of <b>gelification</b> by first increasing up to 334 K, then decreasing. By contrast to what is known in case of phase transition, none of the parameters shows any abrupt change at 334 K, whereas the macroscopic viscosity of the solutions suffers a drastic increase. This is attributed to the fact that positronium is sensitive to the microviscosity of the solutions. At the transition point, the properties of the polyoxipropylene aggregates forming the organic core of the P 84 micelles are not greatly affected. Furthermore, the fact that the experimental N_ag values coincide with those calculated for spheres, from the R_core values, indicates that the shape of the P 84 cores does not change significantly after <b>gelification.</b> The onset of <b>gelification</b> results from a decrease in the hydrogen bonding interactions in the solution with an ensuing relative increase in the interactions between the polyoxipropylene (PPO) groups, initially forming the corona of the P 84 micelles, in an intermicellar mode. This increased solicitation of the PPO groups outside their initial location would result in depletion in the number of surfactant molecules forming the micelles, viz. a decrease in both R_core and N_ag above 334 K. From the data, additional information can be gained regarding the local viscosity and surface tension in the micellar cores...|$|E

40|$|A Pliocene lignite seam up to 160 m thick {{occurs in}} the Velenje basin (Slovenia). The seam {{originated}} in a topogenous mire and evolved within a non-marine, transgressive setting. Differences in soluble organic matter yield and hydrocarbon content of borehole samples from the lignite are related to differences {{in the composition of}} free lipids of microbial origin and/or hydrocarbons derived from the biogeochemical degradation of plant tissue. Variations of the redox conditions within the mire are reflected by pristane/phytane ratios. The abundance of terpenoid biomarkers indicates the predominance of gymnosperms over angiosperms, which is consistent with palynomorphic spectra dominated by pollen of the Sequoia-Taxodium-Metasequoia plant community rather than by angiosperms. Evidence is also provided that the content of land plant derived biomarkers and the preservation of plant tissue is controlled by the input of resin-rich, decay-resistant conifers. Sections of the seam characterized by a high degree of <b>gelification</b> of humotelinite (<b>gelification</b> index) show high contents of hop- 17 (21) -ene but low hopane concentrations. The results suggest that the <b>gelification</b> of plant tissue may be governed by the activity of anaerobic rather than aerobic bacteria. Despite the minor variation in the proportions of gymnosperms versus angiosperms in the peat-forming vegetation, a general influence of the floral assemblage on carbon isotopic composition of the coals (delta(13) C - 25. 3 to - 27. 0 parts per thousand) is proposed. Carbon cycling during biogeochemical decomposition of plant tissue by bacteria is assumed to affect the delta(13) C value of the lignite. Petrographic and geochemical data of gelified and ungelified fossil wood provide evidence that <b>gelification</b> may be governed by microorganisms (e. g. anaerobic bacteria) different from those responsible for decreasing cellulose contents during early diagenetic, aerobic degradation of wood. Based on the molecular composition of terpenoid biomarkers, the wood fragments are identified as derived from gymnosperms. The relative proportions of saturated versus aromatic hydrocarbon fractions of fossil gymnosperms display a general tendency towards lower values in gelified wood remains. This indicates that bacteria involved in <b>gelification</b> of plant tissue may also be involved in aromatisation of diterpenoid hydrocarbons. The chemotaxonomical classification of the macrofossils as gymnosperms is corroborated by the mean carbon isotopic compositions of the macrofossils (delta(13) C = - 24. 5 parts per thousand) and the extracted cellulose (delta(13) C = - 22. 0 parts per thousand). The higher isotopic difference of about 2. 5 %. between cellulose and fossil wood, compared to that found in modern trees, can most probably be explained by the smaller effect of C- 13 discrimination for cellulose when compared with wood during decomposition [Chem. Geol. 158 (1999) 121]. Compared with the coals, the delta(13) C values of wood and extracted cellulose are affected to a minor extent by microbial activity. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd.

30|$|It is {{important}} to understand the variations in the petrographic constituents of Gujarat lignites along the lignite seam profiles, from bottom to top, in order to know their evolutionary history. In the Cambay basin, brown bands are more prevalent and are mostly unstratified and contain high matrix while only few black, thin bands (V- 5, VL- 6, R- 1, and T- 7; Tables  4, 5, 6; Fig.  2) are seen. The black bands in these lignites, are relatively more strongly gelified compared to the brownish bands. More <b>gelification</b> could be caused as a result of anaerobic processes (Iordanidis and Georgakopoulos 2003). Various shades of darkness could also result due to different degrees of plant decomposition (Hagemann and Wolf (1987). The black bands have very high detro-huminite content with little bit less amount of telo-huminite content. Since macerals directly relate to the plants and environment, they provide useful guide to characterize the paleomire. Certain macerals are indicative of paleo-depositional environment, through their presence or absence, (Teichmüller 1989). The characteristics imparted to coal differ with variation in the peat forming plant communities, nutrient supply, temperature, pH, bacterial activity, redox potential and types of deposition (Teichmüller et al. 1998 a, b, c; Lin and Tian 2011). Increase in the clastic mineral matter relates to the surface inundation in the basin (Singh and Singh 1996). Petrography based facies models have been used to discuss the evolutionary history of the paleomires of the Cambay basin. Using petrological tools a number of researchers have successfully performed paleoecological reconstructions and contributions have been made by Cohen and Spackman (1972), Styan and Bustin (1983), Cohen et al. (1987), Calder et al. (1991), Grady et al. (1993), Hawke et al. (1996), Singh and Singh (1996), Shearer and Clarkson (1998), Sun et al. (1998), Dai et al. (2007), Jasper et al. (2010), Singh et al. (2010 a, b), Deng and Sun (2011), and Singh et al. (2012 a, b, c, d). Detro-huminite is throughout high in the lignites of Cambay basin wherein densinite is more consistent. With decrease in the densinite content, there is concomitant increase in the respective attrinite content. Detro-huminite is normally generated in relatively aerobic condition (Teichmüller et al. 1998 b). Moreover, the activities of physical breakdown of plant to particulate matrix are observed at the margin of the peat beds (Kuder et al. 1998). To characterize the paleomires of the Australian Permian coals, Diessel (1986) introduced two indices, <b>gelification</b> index (GI) and tissue preservation index (TPI). Less humified structured and strongly humified unstructured tissue derived macerals indicate the degree of humification and the vegetation type (Diessel 1992). Accordingly, a high TPI value suggests a high subsidence rate of basin and dominance of wood derived tissues, and a low TPI suggests a low subsidence rate with high humification. The degree of <b>gelification</b> of huminite macerals is revealed by GI which distinguishes between gelified and ungelified macerals. For <b>gelification</b> to take place a continuous presence of water is necessary and fluctuation in water table is likely to affect the degree of <b>gelification.</b> However, these indices should be calculated and used carefully. Researchers like Calder (1993) and Collinson and Scott (1987) believe that the palynological and paleobotanical data provide higher precision in the determination of paleoenvironment. Several researchers have objected the usage of such indices for Tertiary or low rank coals (Lambersen et al. 1991; Crosdale 1993; Dehmer 1995; Wust et al. 2001; Scott 2000; Moore and Shearer 2003; Amijaya and Littke 2005). Few researchers have tried a combination of petrographic, organic geochemical and/or isotope data (Bechtel et al. 2002, 2003, 2007 a, b, 2008; Mayr et al. 2009; Savard et al. 2012; Singh et al. 2012 c) for the reconstruction of paleoenvironment. Kalkreuth et al. (1991), Petersen (1993), and Flores (2002) further modified these indices to make them useful for the low rank coals too. In the present investigation, the indices have been taken from Flores (2002) which is a modified version of Kalkreuth et al. (1991), for brown coals.|$|E

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www 3. interscience. wiley. comBACKGROUND: In view of the increasing demand for fresh products in Western countries recently, there is considerable interest in commercialising restructured fish products having the appearance of fresh fish. A number of methods have been studied {{for the purpose of}} inducing cold <b>gelification.</b> Two of the most common methods, namely addition of alginates and addition of transglutaminases, have been studied mainly in connection with meat products. The present study deals with the use of alginate and transglutaminase as additives in cold <b>gelification</b> of minced hake (Merluccius capensis) muscle. The experiments were targeted on the effects of concentration and combined effects of additional additives on physicochemical characteristics and mechanical properties. RESULTS: As regards mechanical properties, the effectiveness of sodium alginate was improved by addition of a low concentration (1 g kg - 1) of calcium chloride (CaCl 2), whereas a higher concentration (10 g kg- 1) reduced the binding ability of the alginate. The presence of sodium caseinate (15 g kg- 1) in combination with microbial transglutaminase (MTGase) was important in helping to increase the work of penetration in fish gels induced at low temperature. Examination of the chemical properties of the muscle gels showed that sodium alginate did not establish covalent protein-protein bonds, while MTGase dramatically increased the number of covalent bonds formed between adjacent muscle proteins. CONCLUSION: With both ingredients, thermostable fish gels of good quality were produced at temperatures below 10 °C. Gels induced by sodium alginate were considerably improved by addition of 1 g kg- 1 CaCl 2. However, gels induced by MTGase were better suited for the preparation of restructured products. © 2008 Society of Chemical Industry. Peer Reviewe...|$|E

Differences in the pathways must have occurred before the precursors for the dominant macerals of each density-fractionated sample underwent diagenesis in a classic peat-forming environment, wherein geochemical coalification, affecting {{the sum total of}} coal-forming materials, took place. Any other process affecting the materials during coalification should have imparted similar characteristics on all coal-forming materials. The dominant macerals of vitrinite-rich sample, collotelinite and collodetrinite, formed through humification and <b>gelification</b> of woody tissues in a water-logged setting (Teichmüller 1989; Diessel 1992; Krevelen 1993; ICCP 1998; Taylor et al. 1998; Hower et al. 2013; O’Keefe et al. 2013). Vitrinite formation is thus consistent with the lower radical content for the vitrinite-rich sample, thus lacking the pronounced, heat-induced alteration associated with fusinite genesis.|$|E
40|$|Denaturation {{temperatures}} and enthalpies of bovine serumalbumin (BSA) and human serumalbumin (HSA) measured by DSC at different pH values and protein concentrations are {{compared with the}} literature data on BSA, or SH-blocked BSA. Both parameters display a trend {{in the region of}} pH 6. 0 – 8. 5 with a maximum at pH 7. 1 – 7. 2, in agreement with the literature data. An exothermic peak related to protein aggregation and precipitation was found at higher temperatures. For BSA, at lower pH values, this peak moves towards lower {{temperatures and}} overlaps the denaturation endothermic peak at pH < 5. 5. The maximum temperature of aggregation, however, depends markedly on the protein concentration; therefore a separation of the two peaks was attempted. At pH 4. 0, a shoulder appears at a temperature lower than that of denaturation. A <b>gelification</b> phenomenon also occurs and partially interferes with the other thermal processes...|$|E
40|$|Over {{the last}} few years, polymer/clay nanocomposites have been an area of {{intensive}} research due to their capacity to improve {{the properties of the}} polymer resin. These nanocharged polymers exhibit a complex rheological behavior due to their dispersed structure in the matrix. Thus, to gain fundamental understanding of nanocomposite dispersion, characterization of their internal structure and their rheological behavior is crucial. Such understanding is also key to determine the manufacturing conditions to produce these nanomaterials by liquid composite molding (LCM) process. This paper investigates the mix of nanoclays particles in an unsaturated polyester resin using three different dispersion techniques: manual mixing, sonication, and high shear mixing (HSM). This paper shows that the mixing method has a significant effect on the sample morphology. Rheology, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) characterization techniques were used to analyze the blends morphology and evaluate the nanoclays stacks/polymer matrix interaction. Several phenomena, such as shear thinning and premature polymer <b>gelification,</b> were notably observed...|$|E
40|$|Cobalt-niobia {{catalysts}} {{were prepared}} using the colloidal sol-gel technique. Niobium chloride or niobia oxide {{were used as}} precursor. The differences between the procedures used are due to the methods of preparation of the colloidal suspensions and <b>gelification.</b> The catalysts were characterised using adsorption and desorption curves of Kr and N- 2 at 77 K, H- 2 -Chemisorption, XRD, FT-IR, XPS and electron microscopy investigations. Preparation of these catalysts without experimental precautions led to a very inhomogeneous structural and textural material. In contrast, the colloidal sol-gel technique controls both {{the structure of the}} niobia oxide and the tailoring of cobalt. A strong metal support interaction effect (SMSI) was present irrespective of the sample preparation variant. Although the rate of butane hydrogenolysis was low for all catalysts, a correlation between TOF and the catalyst crystallite size was found. Selectivity to methane, ethane, propane or to isomerization also depends on the catalyst crystallite size. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|This work {{investigated}} {{the use of}} a thermoreversible gel as a collector vehicle in reverse iontophoresis applications. A 20 % (w/w) aqueous gel of Pluronic F 127 was a suitable receptor medium to be used at the cathodal chamber. In vitro iontophoresis experiments {{investigated the}} simultaneous extraction of lithium (analyte of interest) and sodium (used as an internal standard) into either a control buffer or a gelled receptor. The <b>gelification</b> process at room temperature provided a suitable consistency and contact with the skin surface during the iontophoresis experiments. Subsequent cooling of the gelled solution to 4 degrees C allows an easy recovery of lithium and sodium for later quantification. Both the lithium extraction fluxes and the lithium to sodium ratio of extraction fluxes were linearly related to the subdermal lithium concentration. On the whole, the results show that thermoreversible polymer solutions offer a simple and convenient way to handle samples in reverse iontophoresis studies...|$|E
