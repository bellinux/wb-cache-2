5|$|Even in {{the absence}} of close contact between {{humanity}} and extraterrestrials, high-information messages from an extraterrestrial civilization to humanity have the potential to cause a great cultural shock. Sociologist Donald Tarter has conjectured that knowledge of extraterrestrial culture and theology has the potential to compromise human allegiance to existing organizational structures and institutions. The cultural shock of meeting an extraterrestrial civilization may be spread over <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> even centuries if an extraterrestrial message to humanity is extremely difficult to decipher.|$|E
5|$|Individual {{school districts}} have responded to {{complaints}} by local Native American individuals and tribes, or have made changes due to an increased awareness of the issue among educators and students. New Native mascots have not been proposed in recent <b>decades,</b> <b>or</b> are withdrawn before becoming official due to public opposition. For example, in 2016 {{when one of the}} teams in the National College Prospects Hockey League (NCPHL) was announced as the Lake Erie Warriors with a caricature Mohawk logo it was immediate changed to the Lake Erie Eagles.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} Earth's {{magnetic}} field {{is one of}} heteroscedastic fluctuation. An instantaneous measurement of it, or several measurements of it across the span of <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries, are not sufficient to extrapolate an overall trend in the field strength. It has gone {{up and down in}} the past for unknown reasons. Also, noting the local intensity of the dipole field (or its fluctuation) is insufficient to characterize Earth's magnetic field as a whole, as it is not strictly a dipole field. The dipole component of Earth's field can diminish even while the total magnetic field remains the same or increases.|$|E
25|$|Planning, licensing, and {{constructing}} even {{a single}} nuclear plant typically takes a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical components of nuclear plants. Rebuilding that capacity will take a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|R

5|$|Mathematicians became {{interested}} in mirror symmetry around 1990 when physicists Philip Candelas, Xenia de la Ossa, Paul Green, and Linda Parkes showed that mirror symmetry {{could be used to}} solve problems in enumerative geometry that had resisted solution for <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> more. These results were presented to mathematicians at a conference at the Mathematical Sciences Research Institute (MSRI) in Berkeley, California in May 1991. During this conference, it was noticed that one of the numbers Candelas had computed for the counting of rational curves disagreed with the number obtained by Norwegian mathematicians Geir Ellingsrud and Stein Arild Strømme using ostensibly more rigorous techniques. Many mathematicians at the conference assumed that Candelas's work contained a mistake since it was not based on rigorous mathematical arguments. However, after examining their solution, Ellingsrud and Strømme discovered an error in their computer code and, upon fixing the code, they got an answer that agreed with the one obtained by Candelas and his collaborators.|$|E

25|$|Since {{the game}} was known and popular in the seventeenth century, it is logical to suppose it may have existed {{at least a few}} <b>decades</b> (<b>or</b> perhaps even many centuries) before its {{earliest}} literary reference; but no conclusive evidence has yet been presented to support this theory.|$|E
25|$|A {{generation}} {{ship would}} travel much slower than light, with consequent interstellar trip times of many <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries.

25|$|Reagan also stopped {{aggressive}} pushing of new auto efficiency {{standard by}} Carter administration, descended on alternative energy researches started by Carter administration.

25|$|They {{represent}} {{more than}} half of the tracked debris orbit the Earth with a mean altitude above , so they would likely remain in orbit for <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries. Based on 2009 and 2013 calculations of solar flux, the NASA Orbital Debris Program Office estimated that around 30% of the larger-than- debris would still be in orbit in 2035.|$|E
25|$|At some mines, acidic {{drainage}} {{is detected}} within 2–5 years after mining begins, whereas at other mines, {{it is not}} detected for several decades. In addition, acidic drainage may be generated for <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries after it is first detected. For this reason, acid mine drainage is considered a serious long-term environmental problem associated with mining.|$|E
25|$|An {{additional}} complication is that production requires tilling new soil {{which produces}} a one-off release of GHG {{that it can}} take <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries of production reductions in GHG emissions to equalize. As an example, converting grass lands to corn production for ethanol takes about a century of annual savings {{to make up for}} the GHG released from the initial tilling.|$|E

Ehrlich in the 1960s and 1970s, has led some people, such as economist Julian L. Simon, to question its inevitability.|$|E
25|$|A {{number of}} secret {{societies}} at the university, {{most notably the}} Seven Society, Z Society, and IMP Society, have operated for <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> centuries, leaving their painted marks on university buildings. Other significant secret societies include Eli Banana, T.I.L.K.A., the Purple Shadows (who commemorate Jefferson's birthday shortly after dawn on the Lawn each April 13), The Sons of Liberty, and the 21 Society. Not all the secret societies keep their membership unknown, but even those who don't hide their identities generally keep most of their good works and activities far from the public eye.|$|E
25|$|The pre-Columbian era {{incorporates}} all period subdivisions in {{the history}} and prehistory of the Americas before the appearance of significant European influences on the American continents, spanning {{the time of the}} original settlement in the Upper Paleolithic period to European colonization during the Early Modern period. While technically referring to the era before Christopher Columbus' voyages of 1492 to 1504, in practice the term usually includes the history of American indigenous cultures until they were conquered or significantly influenced by Europeans, even if this happened <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> even centuries after Columbus' initial landing.|$|E

25|$|Preservation groups {{including}} the Sierra Club and Restore Hetch Hetchy state that draining Hetch Hetchy {{would open the}} valley back up to recreation, a right that should be provided to the American people because the reservoir is within the legal boundaries of a national park. They acknowledge that a concerted effort {{would have to be}} made to control the introduction of wildlife and tourism back into the valley in order to prevent destabilization of the ecosystem, and that it might be <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> even centuries before the valley could be returned to natural conditions.|$|E
25|$|The {{industrial}} {{areas of the}} Union-Miles Park neighborhood are clustered primarily along the railroad tracks. As of 2004, roughly 30 medium to large manufacturing companies called the neighborhood home. Major industries included building materials manufacturing, chemical manufacturing, commercial laundries, coatings and varnish manufacturing, small foundries and metal-shaping operations, machine shops, roofing materials manufacturing, and warehouses. Many of these surviving industries have existed for two <b>decades</b> <b>or</b> more, and are family-owned. In 2004, there were 104 vacant or underutilized parcels in the Union-Miles Park industrial district. Although polluted properties were uncommon, most of the vacant/underutilized parcels have brownfield problems and are not ready for development.|$|E
