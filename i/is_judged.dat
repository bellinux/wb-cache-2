5|$|The codex, {{although}} displaying Mixtec stylistic features, <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to be Maya (if genuine) {{based upon}} the use of bark paper instead of the deerhide preferred for Mixtec codices {{and because of the}} presence of Maya day signs and numbering. The Mixtec interpretation of the iconography may simply be due to incomplete knowledge of highland Maya iconography during the Postclassic period.|$|E
5|$|Walton's {{only other}} opera, The Bear, {{based on a}} comic {{vaudeville}} by Chekhov, <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> by critics as much more successful. It is, however, a one-act piece, a genre not regularly staged at most opera houses, and so is infrequently seen. Operabase records four productions of the piece worldwide between 2013 and 2015.|$|E
5000|$|But farther, this question, (Who shall <b>be</b> <b>judge?)</b> cannot mean, {{that there}} <b>is</b> no <b>judge</b> at all: for {{where there is}} no {{judicature}} on earth, to decide controversies amongst men, God in heaven <b>is</b> <b>judge.</b> He alone, it <b>is</b> true, <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> of the right. But every man <b>is</b> <b>judge</b> for himself, as in all other cases, so in this, whether another hath put himself into a state of war with him, and whether he should appeal to the Supreme Judge, as Jeptha did.|$|R

5|$|In {{pursuit of}} these funds he {{traveled}} to the Thracian Chersonese and attacked Selymbria. He plotted with a pro-Athenian party within the city and offered the Selymbrians reasonable terms and imposed strict discipline {{to see that they}} were observed. He did their city no injury whatsoever, but merely took a sum of money from it, set a garrison in it and left. Epigraphical evidence indicates the Selymbrians surrendered hostages until the treaty was ratified in Athens. His performance <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> as skillful by historians, since it saved time, resources, and lives and still fully achieved his goal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the rules}} of baseball, aside from the rare case of {{interference}} or obstruction, a batter who puts a ball into play and safely reaches first base is ruled to have reached {{in one of three}} possible ways: a hit, an error, or by fielder's choice. Fielder's choice is primarily discussed in rules 10.05 and 10.06, and it generally occurs when it <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> that a batter-runner would have been put out had the defense chosen to do so.|$|E
5|$|It is {{acceptable}} to defend from a violent attack anywhere on the street especially {{when a person is}} attacked with a knife or another deadly weapon. Shooting an unarmed attacker also occurs and becomes sometimes a subject of controversy. In general, each case is investigated in great detail before being eventually dismissed as a legitimate self-defense. The defense <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> according to the subjective and objective perception of the defender {{during the time of the}} imminent or ongoing attack, and not according to the view of persons who are judging it ex post.|$|E

40|$|Can’t one truly <b>judge</b> {{that one}} <b>is</b> <b>judging?</b> Matthew Soteriou {{provides}} {{an analysis of}} authoritatively knowing one’s own mental acts which depends on a surprising assumption: One cannot truly <b>judge</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> After briefly criticizing his account of one’s awareness that one <b>is</b> <b>judging,</b> I critically scrutinize two of his arguments against the possibility of truly <b>judging</b> that one <b>is</b> <b>judging.</b> Firstly, assuming such a possibility leads to a regress. Secondly, the second-order judgement inevitably replaces the first-order judgement such as to make the former wrong. Matthew Soteriou (2005) has provided a thorough analysis of our intuitive claims to be directly and authoritatively aware of our own mental activity. Soteriou opposes non-occurrent belief and conscious judgement. The latter is a mental act, the former is not. Conscious judgement is identified with occurrent belief (Soteriou 2005, 96). While one can have a non-occurrent belief that one is believing that p despite not believing that p, one’s non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> now <b>judging</b> that p cannot be subject to such a mistake. Whenever one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p (Soteriou 2005, 95). Whenever one has a non-occurrent belief that one <b>is</b> <b>judging</b> that p, this belief cannot be false...|$|R
50|$|Throughout its {{existence}} {{the court had}} two permanent judges at any one time. From 1865 to 1878 and 1905 to 1943 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled <b>Judge</b> and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> Assistant <b>Judge.</b> Between 1878 and 1905 the senior <b>judge</b> <b>was</b> titled Chief Justice and the junior <b>judge's</b> title <b>was</b> <b>Judge.</b>|$|R
5|$|The dating of potbelly sculptures {{has been}} {{problematic}} with {{few of the}} earlier known sculptures being found in their original context. Investigators from the 1950s through to the 1970s argued that the style was Olmec derived or perhaps pre-Olmec. Olmec culture <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to have lasted from 1500 BC through to 400 BC based on radiocarbon dating. Investigations at Santa Leticia were focused on answering the dating problem and securely dated Santa Leticia Monuments 1 and 3 to between 500 BC and AD 100 {{using a combination of}} radiocarbon dating and ceramic evidence.|$|E
5|$|The {{duration}} of time until an eventual reward also affects participants' choice of immediate or delayed gratification. A 2001 study demonstrated {{that if a}} reward will not be granted for an extensive amount of time, such as 180–300 months (15–25 years), the monetary amount of the reward is inconsequential; instead, {{the bulk of the}} participants choose the immediate reward, even if their delayed reward would be quite large. Delayed gratification has its limits, and a delay can only be so long before it <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to be not worth the effort it takes to wait.|$|E
5|$|There are {{two types}} of field events: jumps, and throws. In jumping competitions, athletes are judged on either the length or height of their jumps. The {{performances}} of jumping events for distance are measured from a board or marker, and any athlete overstepping this mark <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to have fouled. In the jumps for height, an athlete must clear their body over a crossbar without knocking the bar off the supporting standards. The majority of jumping events are unaided, although athletes propel themselves vertically with purpose-built sticks in the pole vault.|$|E

5|$|As in the House of Commons, {{a number}} of {{qualifications}} apply to being an MSP. Such qualifications were introduced under the House of Commons Disqualification Act 1975 and the British Nationality Act 1981. Specifically, members must be {{over the age of}} 18 and must be a citizen of the United Kingdom, the Republic of Ireland, one of the countries in the Commonwealth of Nations, a citizen of a British overseas territory, or a European Union citizen resident in the UK. Members of the police and the armed forces are disqualified from sitting in the Scottish Parliament as elected MSPs, and similarly, civil servants and members of foreign legislatures are disqualified.

5|$|Every second, {{approximately}} 28 cubed {{meters of}} water {{flows into the}} bay. The exchange with the Gulf of Mexico occurs at Cedar Bayou and Aransas Pass. As {{a result of the}} seawater exchange, the bay's salinity is 15 parts per thousand, compared to the seawater average of 35 ppt. This discrepancy is brought about by the volume of fresh water that empties into the bay and its extensions, from Copano Creek, Mission River and Aransas River, forming the Mission-Aransas estuary. Fresh water flows also arrive from the impact of the Guadalupe River on San Antonio Bay. Combined, the fresh water influence is 60 to 70 percent of the system's volume, which <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to be minimal.|$|E
5|$|Nearly {{every action}} (or lack thereof) affects how the player <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> by their followers: the player {{may be seen}} as a good god, an evil one, or {{in-between}} the two. The land, interface (including the hand), and music change according to that alignment. A good god's temple is brightly coloured, while an evil god's is designed to look intimidating. It is not necessary to consistently perform acts of either alignment and a mixture of the two can be used to stay neutral. The player has two advisors, one good and the other evil, who try to persuade the player to do things their according to their alignment.|$|E

5|$|Theme Park offers {{three levels}} of simulation: the higher {{difficulties}} requiring more management of aspects such as logistics. For example, at full level, the player must manage research, negotiations, stocks, and shares. On sandbox, the game does not involve those aspects. The player can switch mode at any time. Game time is implemented like a calendar: {{at the end of}} each year, the player <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> on that year's performance against rivals. Game speed can be adjusted, and staff can be moved by the player. Cash awards may be earned for doing well, and trophies may be awarded for achievements such as having the longest roller coaster.|$|E
5|$|Towards {{the end of}} {{the school}} year, Nikumbh organises an art fair for the staff and students. The {{competition}} <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> by artist Lalita Lajmi. Ishaan, with his strikingly creative style, is declared the winner and Nikumbh, who paints Ishaan's portrait, the runner-up. The principal announces that Nikumbh has been hired as the school's permanent art teacher. When Ishaan's parents meet his teachers on the last day of school they are left speechless by the transformation they see in him. Overcome with emotion, Ishaan's father thanks Nikumbh. As Ishaan gets into the car to leave with his parents for summer vacations, he turns around and runs toward Nikumbh, who gives him a hug and tells him to return next year. The film ends with a freeze-frame shot of Nikumbh tossing Ishaan into the air.|$|E
5|$|In {{some cases}} the {{official}} scorer is not given the discretion to decide between awarding a hit to the batter or ruling that he safely reached first base by fielder's choice. If a preceding runner is forced out or if an unforced preceding runner is put out while attempting {{to return to their}} original base, a hit is automatically not credited and the batter by rule <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to have reached by a fielder's choice. In some situations this rule may appear unfair to the batter. For example, if the batter is a fast runner, the ball is slowly hit to the third baseman, and an unforced runner from second realizes (too late) that he can not safely advance, the batter-runner will lose the potential hit on a fielder's choice by the third baseman. This occurs regardless of whether the batter-runner would have reached first base with an ordinary effort to put him out.|$|E

5|$|In the First Phase, the Cadet {{is saved}} from a Behemoth attack by Ace, who brings {{them to the}} safety of Akademeia. There they are {{introduced}} to everyday life and sent out on a mission against the Behemoth. Then war is declared against Milites after its aggressive actions against Rubrum and Lorica, and the Cadet learns of Class Zero. Concordia forms an alliance with Milites, severely hampering Rubrum's efforts. Rubrum then musters their forces, including their powerful magical warriors, and conquer all three Crystal States. In the final chapter, Rubrum's victory over the other Crystal States causes the arrival of Tempus Finis, and Miyu is made into a l'Cie and renamed Judge Myuria: her mission is to test the Cadet to see if they are worthy of becoming the Agito. The Cadet is victorious, but it <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> the Agito has not appeared and Tempus Finis consumes the world, resetting it for a new cycle of history.|$|E
5|$|Whitney Russell is {{the eldest}} {{daughter}} of Eve and T.C. Russell. She is introduced as {{a close friend}} of Theresa Lopez-Fitzgerald Crane, but she became prominent on the show as the love interest of Chad Harris-Crane. When Chad is incorrectly identified as Eve and Julian's son, his relationship with Whitney <b>is</b> <b>judged</b> to be incestuous. Whitney's confusion about her relationship with Chad, and her shame at possibly committing incest, escalates after she becomes pregnant and gives birth to their son, Miles Harris-Crane. Whitney briefly becomes estranged from Chad and Harmony, and becomes a nun to absolve herself of the sin of incest. The discovery of Chad's birth certificate proves the couple are not blood relatives; they resume their relationship and eventually marry. Whitney leaves Chad after discovering his affair with Vincent Clarkson. Their later reconciliation is cut short when he is murdered by Alistair Crane. Following Chad's death, Whitney moves to New Orleans to raise Miles, and her unborn child, with the help of Simone. Whitney does not appear on screen after the show moved from NBC to DirecTV, but she is referenced in a telephone call to police chief Sam Bennett and Simone's letter to her best friend Kay Bennett.|$|E
