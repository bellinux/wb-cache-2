DSWP, in particular, and PMT techniques, in general, are able to tolerate inter-core latencies, while still handling codes with complex recurrences. They achieve this by enforcing an acyclic communication discipline amongst threads, which allow threads to use inter-thread queues to communicate in a pipelined fashion. This dissertation demonstrates that DSWPed codes not only tolerate inter-core communication costs, but also effectively tolerate variable latency stalls in applications better than single-threaded execution on both in-order and out-of-order issue processors with comparable resources. It then performs a thorough analysis of the performance scalability of automatically generated DSWPed codes and identifies the conditions necessary to achieve peak PMT performance. Next, the dissertation shows that even though PMT applications tolerate inter-core latencies well, the high frequency of inter-thread communication (once every 5 to 20 dynamic instructions) in these codes, makes them very sensitive to the intra-thread overhead imposed by communication operations. In order to understand the issues surrounding inter-thread communication for PMT applications, this dissertation undertakes a methodical exploration of the design space of communication support options for PMT.

This database has recorded all operatively managed fractures since 1989. Fractures are entered and coded {{according to the}} Arbeitsgemeinschaft für Osteosynthesefragen/Orthopaedic Trauma Association (AO/OTA) Fracture Classification System by orthopaedic trauma fellows trained in this classification system [17]. Data is stored and manipulated using a commercially available software program (Microsoft Access). Inclusion criteria required skeletal maturity, a complete medical chart relative to their injury, adequate preoperative and postoperative radiographic imaging including CT scans, and to have had their definitive surgical procedure performed at our center. From 29 May 2012 to 31 July 2012, 24 consecutive patients with unstable pelvic ring injuries who underwent operative fixation using percutaneous iliosacral screws were identified. Pelvic ring injuries and associated instability was identified by preoperative radiographic and CT imaging which demonstrated combinations of anterior and posterior pelvic ring disruptions. Anterior ring injuries consisted of either unilateral or bilateral superior and inferior rami fractures or complete symphysis pubis disruptions. Posterior pelvic ring injuries consisted of a complete sacral fracture, sacroiliac joint disruption, or a posterior ilium/sacroiliac joint fracture dislocation. All patients underwent an examination under anesthesia as previously described [18]. These examinations demonstrated and documented the instability present, especially in the 61 -B injury patterns. All patients had documented posterior pelvic ring instability and therefore underwent appropriate operative fixation with accompanying percutaneous fixation to stabilize the posterior aspect of their pelvic ring injury. One orthopaedic traumatologist at a regional level 1 trauma center treated all patients. All iliosacral screws were placed using standard and previously described techniques with inlet, outlet, and lateral fluoroscopic imaging only utilizing a C-arm [2, 19, 20]. Once adequately resuscitated and evaluated, each patient was sedated and transported to the operating suite where they surrendered to general anesthesia. The patient was then transferred onto a radiolucent operating table {{and placed in a}} supine position. The patient was placed onto two folded blankets beneath the lumbosacral spine. The blanket bump is precisely placed with the distal aspect of the blankets at the testicles or labia and {{in the center of the}} lumbosacral spine. The perineum was cleansed and isolated from the operative field with adhesive drapes. The entire abdomen and bilateral flanks were then sequentially cleansed with iodine and isopropyl alcohol. Accurate reductions of the pelvic ring injuries were achieved by both open and closed means as guided by the injury patterns and surrounding soft tissue status. All screws placed in this cohort were with the patient in a supine position. Posterior ring fixation consisted of 7.0 -mm diameter cannulated screws (Synthes, Paoli, PA, USA) or 7.0 -mm diameter cannulated screws (Zimmer, Warsaw, IN, USA) of varying length; both <b>fully</b> and partially <b>threaded</b> screws were used depending on injury pattern, available osseous fixation pathways, and associated fixation strategy.

40|$|Modern {{communication}} {{relies on}} electronic messages {{organized in the}} form of discussion threads. Emails, IMs, SMS, website comments, and forums are all composed of threads, which consist of individual user messages connected by metadata and discourse coherence to messages from other users. Threads are used to display user messages effectively in a GUI such as an email client, providing a background context for understanding a single message. Many messages are meaningless without the context provided by their thread. However, a number of factors may result in missing thread structure, ranging from user mistake (replying to the wrong message), to missing metadata (some email clients do not produce/save headers that <b>fully</b> encapsulate <b>thread</b> structure; and, conversion of archived threads from over repository to another may also result in lost metadata), to covert use (users may avoid metadata to render discussions difficult for third parties to understand). In the field of security, law enforcement agencies may obtain vast collections of discussion turns that require automatic thread reconstruction to understand. For example, the Enron Email Corpus, obtained by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission during its investigation of the Enron Corporation, has no inherent thread structure. In this thesis, we will use natural language processing approaches to reconstruct threads from message content. Reconstruction based on message content sidesteps the problem of missing metadata, permitting post hoc reorganization and discussion understanding. We will investigate corpora of email threads and Wikipedia discussions. However, there is a scarcity of annotated corpora for this task. For example, the Enron Emails Corpus contains no inherent thread structure. Therefore, we also investigate issues faced when creating crowdsourced datasets and learning statistical models of them. Several of our findings are applicable for other natural language machine classification tasks, beyond thread reconstruction. We will divide our investigation of discussion thread reconstruction into two parts. First, we explore techniques needed to create a corpus for our thread reconstruction research. Like other NLP pairwise classification tasks such as Wikipedia discussion turn/edit alignment and sentence pair text similarity rating, email thread disentanglement is a heavily class-imbalanced problem, and although the advent of crowdsourcing has reduced annotation costs, the common practice of crowdsourcing redundancy is too expensive for class-imbalanced tasks. As the first contribution of this thesis, we evaluate alternative strategies for reducing crowdsourcing annotation redundancy for class-imbalanced NLP tasks. We also examine techniques to learn the best machine classifier from our crowdsourced labels. In order to reduce noise in training data, most natural language crowdsourcing annotation tasks gather redundant labels and aggregate them into an integrated label, which is provided to the classifier. However, aggregation discards potentially useful information from linguistically ambiguous instances. For the second contribution of this thesis, we show that, for four of five natural language tasks, filtering of the training dataset based on crowdsource annotation item agreement improves task performance, while soft labeling based on crowdsource annotations does not improve task performance. Second, we investigate thread reconstruction as divided into the tasks of thread disentanglement and adjacency recognition. We present the Enron Threads Corpus, a newly-extracted corpus of 70, 178 multi-email threads with emails from the Enron Email Corpus. In the original Enron Emails Corpus, emails are not sorted by thread. To disentangle these threads, and as the third contribution of this thesis, we perform pairwise classification, using text similarity measures on non-quoted texts in emails. We show that i) content text similarity metrics outperform style and structure text similarity metrics in both a class-balanced and class-imbalanced setting, and ii) although feature performance is dependent on the semantic similarity of the corpus, content features are still effective even when controlling for semantic similarity. To reconstruct threads, it is also necessary to identify adjacency relations among pairs. For the forum of Wikipedia discussions, metadata is not available, and dialogue act typologies, helpful for other domains, are inapplicable. As our fourth contribution, via our experiments, we show that adjacency pair recognition can be performed using lexical pair features, without a dialogue act typology or metadata, and that this is robust to controlling for topic bias of the discussions. Yet, lexical pair features do not effectively model the lexical semantic relations between adjacency pairs. To model lexical semantic relations, and as our fifth contribution, we perform adjacency recognition using extracted keyphrases enhanced with semantically related terms. While this technique outperforms a most frequent class baseline, it fails to outperform lexical pair features or tf-idf weighted cosine similarity. Our investigation shows that this is the result of poor word sense disambiguation and poor keyphrase extraction causing spurious false positive semantic connections. In concluding this thesis, we also reflect on open issues and unanswered questions remaining after our research contributions, discuss applications for thread reconstruction, and suggest some directions for future work...|$|R
