The two men greatly respected one another and shared a bond in that they both had past military experience. Their positive relationship facilitated Clark’s many accomplishments while in Sapporo and accounted for the wide latitude Clark was given <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> not just SAC programs, but also his influence on the colonial development of Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|Congestion pricing {{has also}} been {{implemented}} for scheduled airline services. The British Airports Authority (BAA) has been a pioneer <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> congestion pricing {{for all types of}} commercial aviation. In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy, with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day, and by 1976 raised these peak charges. London-Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984. In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case.|$|E

Tensions within the F-FDTL also continue to threaten the stability of the force. However, the East Timorese government places a high priority on re-establishing the F-FDTL and developing it into a force capable of defending the country. In 2015 the Australian Defence Intelligence Organisation reported that little progress has been made <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> the Force 2020 plans.|$|E
5|$|The ReactOS and the Wine {{projects}} {{share the}} goal to run binary Windows software natively and can share therefore many dependencies and development. ReactOS uses {{portions of the}} Wine project {{so that it can}} benefit from Wine's progress <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> the Win32 API. While Wine's NTDLL, USER32, KERNEL32, GDI32, and ADVAPI32 components cannot be used directly by ReactOS due to architectural differences, code snippets of them and other parts can be shared between both projects. The kernel is developed by ReactOS separately as Wine relies here on existing Unix-like kernels.|$|E

An important component of the system is the reticular formation, a group of neuron-clusters scattered diffusely through the core of the lower brain. Reticular neurons send signals to the thalamus, which in turn sends activity-level-controlling signals to every part of the cortex. Damage to the reticular formation can produce a permanent state of coma.|$|E

5|$|Understanding data {{dependencies}} {{is fundamental}} <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> parallel algorithms. No program can run {{more quickly than}} the longest chain of dependent calculations (known as the critical path), since calculations that depend upon prior calculations in the chain must be executed in order. However, most algorithms do not consist of just a long chain of dependent calculations; there are usually opportunities to execute independent calculations in parallel.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the tribes}} made {{progress}} <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> the Hathaway plans {{with the paper}} and timber companies, Krulitz ceased to support the proposal when {{the full extent of}} the required federal appropriations became clear.

Tureen and Jankelalong with Donald Perkins, a lawyer for the paper and timber companiesnegotiated a solution whereby $30 million of the settlement funds would come from various programs in the federal budget. That settlement was presented to the Maine congressional delegation in August 1979, but they refusal to endorse it until the Maine legislature had approved it. Governor Langley, in turn, refused to accept any deal that would limit the state's jurisdiction over the tribes.|$|E

5|$|From the beginning, {{the company}} {{encountered}} delays <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> its plans. Neither {{of the two}} main line railway companies were interested in investing in the line, so the W's promoters approached the DR for assistance. In 1911, Albert Stanley, {{managing director of the}} DR, agreed that it would finance the construction, if the promoters would guarantee a return of £6,000 per year for ten years. The DR was to cover any shortfall below 4.5 per cent return on capital. To provide additional capacity for Sutton trains on the DR's Wimbledon branch, the DR published a bill on 21 November 1911 seeking permission to construct additional tracks on the L owned section from Wimbledon to East Putney. The works were approved by the Metropolitan District Railway Act, 1912, which received assent on 7 August 1912. The L was to build the additional tracks with the DR covering the cost.|$|E

Other student projects include The Flat: Bike Collective, which promotes alternative transportation, and the Farmer's Market, which occurs during the fall harvest. The Farmer's Market and many other initiatives came out of student collaboration during the Rethink Conference 2008.|$|E
5|$|This success earned Thơ {{the vice}} presidential slot in December 1956 to widen the popular appeal of Diệm's nepotistic and sectarian regime. It was {{reasoned}} that Thơ's southern heritage would broaden the regime's political appeal—Diệm's family was from central Vietnam and most administrators were not from South Vietnam. Thơ {{was not allowed to}} take part in policy decisions and had little meaningful power, as Diệm's brothers, Nhu and Cẩn, commanded their own private armies and secret police, and ruled arbitrarily. Thơ oversaw South Vietnam's failed land reform policy, and was accused of lacking vigour <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> the program as he was himself a large landowner. He was noted for his faithful support of Diệm during the Buddhist crisis that ended the rule of the Ngô family. Despite nominally being a Buddhist, Thơ defended the regime's pro-Roman Catholic policies and its violent actions against the Buddhist majority.|$|E

5|$|Ulysses S. Grant (born Hiram Ulysses Grant, April 27, 1822 – July 23, 1885) was a {{prominent}} United States Army general during the American Civil War and Commanding General {{at the conclusion of}} that war. He was elected as the 18th President of the United States in 1868, serving from 1869 to 1877. As Commanding General, Grant worked closely with President Abraham Lincoln to lead the Union Army to victory over the Confederacy. After Lincoln's assassination, Grant's assignment <b>in</b> <b>implementing</b> Reconstruction often put him at odds with President Andrew Johnson, Lincoln's successor. Twice elected president, Grant led the Republicans in their effort to remove the vestiges of Confederate nationalism and slavery, protect African-American citizenship, and support economic prosperity. Grant's presidency has often been criticized for its scandals and for his failure to alleviate the economic depression following the Panic of 1873, but modern scholarship regards him as a president who performed a difficult job with some merit, and took strong action on civil rights for African Americans.|$|E
