It became a bestseller. In March 2003, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water was the third-best-selling religious book in Britain and the fourth-best-selling religious book in Scotland. In his book God Can't Sleep: Waiting for Daylight On Life's Dark Nights, Palmer Chinchen writes that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is an [...] "excellent book on faith". Religion News Service journalist Jonathan Merritt called the book a modern classic book. In 2002, <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water received the Christianity Today Book Award in the Christian Living category. Carol Rodman of The Commercial Appeal called the book [...] "challenging". Willow Creek Community Church placed the book on its Essential Reading List. Mary Milla of St. Paul Pioneer Press said that <b>If</b> <b>You</b> <b>Want</b> <b>to</b> Walk on Water is [...] "a must-read for anyone considering a career change ...

5000|$|For {{their fourth}} album, the band changed label from Epitaph to Columbia Records. The band signed a multiple-album deal months before {{releasing}} their previous album. Following the move, the guitarist Joshua Cain said, [...] "It just felt {{right to make}} the move when there was the right interest there." [...] With the new signing, the band's promotional team aimed to develop {{a balance between the}} benefits of a new major label and their previous grass-roots approach. The album saw the band reunite with producer Mark Hoppus, and the album was mostly recorded at his studio in North Hollywood, Opra Music between April and June 2009. Hoppus said that the band wanted to follow in the tracks of Commit This to Memory, but to push things further. Pierre later recalled that the atmosphere in the studio was more loose than their first time working with Hoppus. The band picked the title My Dinosaur Life after a quote Pierre kept repeating—they felt it a nice representation of the album's themes, which include growing old and feeling out of place. After completing the album, the band toured with Blink-182 on their reunion tour, and Pierre undertook a promotional tour called On the Dino Trail wherein he performed acoustic sets.My Dinosaur Life was released to acclaim from music critics upon its debut on January 19, 2010, and it represented the band's all-time best chart performance, peaking at number 15 on the Billboard 200.
