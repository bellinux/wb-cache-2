500|$|The {{shaping of}} {{a signal to}} convey {{information}} is known as modulation. Modulation {{can be used to}} represent a <b>digital</b> <b>message</b> as an analog waveform. This is commonly called [...] "keying" [...] – a term derived from the older use of Morse Code in telecommunications – and several keying techniques exist (these include phase-shift keying, frequency-shift keying, and amplitude-shift keying). The [...] "Bluetooth" [...] system, for example, uses phase-shift keying to exchange information between various devices. In addition, there are combinations of phase-shift keying and amplitude-shift keying which is called (in the jargon of the field) [...] "quadrature amplitude modulation" [...] (QAM) that are used in high-capacity digital radio communication systems.|$|E

2500|$|Leonard Kleinrock (born 1934) {{published}} his first paper on queueing theory in digital networks, [...] "Information Flow in Large Communication Nets", in 1961. After completing his Ph.D. thesis in 1962, which provided a fundamental theory of <b>digital</b> <b>message</b> switching, {{he moved to}} UCLA. In the late 1960s, building on his earlier work on queueing theory, Kleinrock carried out theoretical work to model the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned {{the development of the}} ARPANET. In 1969, a team at UCLA connected a computer to an Interface Message Processor, becoming the first node on ARPANET. His theoretical work on hierarchical routing in the late 1970s with student Farouk Kamoun remains critical to the operation of the Internet today. In 2012, Kleinrock was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.|$|E
