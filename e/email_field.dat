40|$|Abstract. In most web applications, the {{attributes}} of entity classes di-rectly determine the content of corresponding view forms. In addition, these entity classes often encapsulate constraints on associated proper-ties. For example, a User entity class may have an email property with constraints on {{the form of the}} address; consequently, the view form for creating/updating users should include an <b>email</b> <b>field</b> and perform val-idation on the submitted data. Unfortunately, view form development is often done manually, an error-prone and tedious process. Form error detection is particularly difficult because the errors only manifest them-selves at runtime because of weak type safety and limited mechanisms for constraint verification. In addition, entity modification may cause incon-sistency with the corresponding form. In this paper, we propose a new tool, FormBuilder, which automates the development and maintenance of view forms. The application of this tool in production applications has repeatedly demonstrated the practical contribution of this approach...|$|E
40|$|Regular {{expressions}} (REs) are a {{very powerful}} and popular tool to manipu-late string data {{in a variety of}} applications. They are used as search templates to look for the occurrences of a given piece of text in a document, or to define how a given piece of text should be formatted in order to be valid (e. g., to check that the value entered in an <b>email</b> <b>field</b> of a Web form is correctly formatted), or even to help solving more complex NLP tasks [NS 07]. Their popularity in those various application domains arises from several reasons. First, they are easy to understand and manipulate for common usages, despite their wide ex-pressiveness and power of abstraction. Second, they are natively usable within a large variety of programming languages, hence making them suitable to be integrated into every project addressing text processing tasks. Their usage of-ten relies on a very limited amount of hand-crafted REs.

40|$|Introduction – People {{and society}} are more {{concerned}} about Corporate Social Responsibility as well as the demand of outsourcing logistics services. When buyer companies select TPL providers, the selection criteria are focused on cost and on time delivery, while issues like CSR are often placed in a low priority. Purpose – The purpose of this master thesis is to analyze how Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) impacts as selection criteria when buying services from Third Party Logistics (TPL) providers. Design/Methodology – The research approach of this thesis is qualitative. Both primary data and secondary data collection were used; semi-structured interviews, <b>emails,</b> <b>field</b> observation and documentation. There are seven respondents from three different companies. Findings – From buyer companies’ perspective, CSR was taken into account when buying services from TPL providers. However, it had impact on a low priority since the buyer company chose leading TPL providers that have a good reputation and image. The buyer company believes that those selected TPL providers have already implemented CSR practice. Moreover, the results show that the main driving force behind the application of CSR was the customer requirement Research limitations – This master thesis has studied in a specific Swedish company when selecting TPL providers. Moreover, this research has been studied from the buyer companies’ perspective. ...|$|R

40|$|The global public-key {{authentication}} infrastructure standardized in the Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC) {{paves the way}} for Dmail (DNSSEC-enabled email), {{a framework}} that allows secure email address authentication. D espite its fundamental role as an infrastruc-ture for locating Internet entities and devices worldwide, the Domain Name System (DNS) remains vul-nerable to malicious attacks, such as pollution attacks and counter-feit DNS responses. DNS response records aren’t immune to forging, nor can their authenticity be fully guaranteed. In 2005, the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) took steps to secure the DNS by stan-dardizing the Domain Name System Security Extension (DNSSEC), the global deployment of which has done much to enhance Internet pro-tocol and application security. For most current email systems, however, security is still, at best, minimal; an <b>email</b> sender <b>field</b> is easily forged and receivers {{have no way to}} authenticate an email’s origin. This problem is {{due in large part to}} the lack of a global public-key infrastructure (PKI). While DNSSEC was designed primar-ily to authenticate DNS response records, it also offers a vehicle for global public-key exchange. Thus, a DNSSEC-based system for email authentication on various types of devices is now feasible. Here, we introduce a framework that incorporates DNSSEC to secure email.

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, {{national}} and state standards for teacher professional development have increasingly encouraged inquiry-based delivery of continuing education. This qualitative case study explores the progress of one local professional development initiative intended to develop durable teacher communities of practice in support of language arts literacy reform. Using constructivist grounded theory, it analyzes the ways professional communities of practice develop and evolve when teachers are invited to consider/reconsider their own conceptions of teaching and learning. It further explores the ways language arts literacy teachers respond to district-sponsored invitations to examine/reexamine their own conceptions of what constitutes 2 ̆ 2 research-based 2 ̆ 2 language arts literacy practice. Data sources for this practitioner research study included participant journals, interviews, curriculum work products, <b>emails,</b> ethnographic <b>field</b> notes, and official communications.

Starting with the establishment of the first formal district community of practice, a state-mandated local professional development committee, this dissertation describes and analyzes the growth of three teacher communities of practice developed to support professional development and language arts literacy reform. It suggests that communities of practice are most effective when framed as voluntary associations based on a shared sense of organizational purpose and common figured worlds. Teacher leadership is identified as both prerequisite for and outcome of developing communities of practice. The dissertation further concludes that reification can serve to legitimize and stabilize fledgling communities of practice in uncertain administrative environments. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{issue of}} whether it is right to be {{concerned}} about the accuracy with which mass media report social scientific research is explored through a detailed case study of media reporting of two surveys of UK doctors' end-of-life decision-making. Data include press releases, <b>emails</b> and <b>field</b> notes taken during periods of media interest supplemented by a collection of print and broadcast media reports. The case study contributes to existing knowledge about the ways in which mass media establish, exaggerate and otherwise distort the meaning of statistical findings. Journalists ignored findings that did not fit into existing media interest in the 'assisted dying' story and were subject to pressure from interest groups concerned to promote their own interpretations and viewpoints. Rogue statistics mutated as they were set loose from their original research report context and were 'laundered' as they passed from one media report to another. Yet media accounts of the research, fuelling an already heated public debate about ethical issues in end-of-life care, arguably acted as a conduit for introducing new considerations into this debate, such as the role played by sedation at the end of life, the extent to which euthanasia is practiced outside the law, and the extent of medical opposition to the legalisation of assisted dying. The expectation that accuracy and comprehensiveness should be the sole criteria for judging journalists' reports is, finally, considered to be unrealistic and it is argued that social scientists need to understand and adapted to the conditions under which mass media reporting operates if they are to succeed in introducing the findings of social research into public debates.

40|$|There is an {{extensive}} {{body of research}} on Social Network Analysis (SNA) based on the email archive. The network used in the analysis is generally extracted either by capturing the email communication in From, To, Cc and Bcc <b>email</b> header <b>fields</b> or by the entities contained in the email message. In the latter case, the entities could be, for instance, the bag of words, url's, names, phones, etc. It could also include the textual content of attachments, for instance Microsoft Word documents, excel spreadsheets, or Adobe pdfs. The nodes in this network represent users and entities. The edges represent communication between users and relations to the entities. We suggest taking {{a different approach to}} the network extraction and use attachments shared between users as the edges. The motivation for this is two-fold. First, attachments represent the "intimacy" manifestation of the relation's strength. Second, the statistical analysis of private email archives that we collected and Enron email corpus shows that the attachments contribute in average around 80 - 90 % to the archive's disk-space usage, which means that most of the data is presently ignored in the SNA of email archives. Consequently, we hypothesize that this approach might provide more insight into the social structure of the email archive. We extract the communication and shared attachments networks from Enron email corpus. We further analyze degree, betweenness, closeness, and eigenvector centrality measures in both networks and review the differences and what can be learned from them. We use nearest neighbor algorithm to generate similarity groups for five Enron employees. The groups are consistent with Enron's organizational chart, which validates our approach.
