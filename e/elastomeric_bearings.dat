The basic aim of this dissertation is to analyze the RCC, bridge, statically and dynamically. The performance of bridge is studied with and without application of isolation system. This includes the study of rigid bridge, base isolated bridge, and bridge with bearings between girder and top of pier. The effect of seismic force on these bridge model is carefully studied by applying the seismic force. Depending on behavior of these models the actual seismic demand of bridge is determined and also the importance of isolation system is taken into consideration. The attempts are done to reduce the seismic effect thereby introducing the isolation. The isolations are of various type, here <b>elastomeric</b> <b>bearing</b> and led rubber isolator is used. Also, the comparison of isolated and un isolated bridge structure is carried out. The analysis is mainly consists of response spectrum analysis, time history analysis, eigen value analysis, moving load analysis, and non linear push over analysis etc. Keyword- Rigid bridge structure, isolated bridge structure, <b>elastomeric</b> <b>bearing</b> and rubber pad.

Soft rubbers seem to be more sensitive to the compression load than hard rubbers as far as the damping factor is concerned, whereas the influence of the compression load on the shear modulus seems to be peculiar of every mixture and not apparently related on the hardness, which can explain the inconsistencies found in literature relevant to the studies on full scale rubber bearings...|$|R

5000|$|Juan de la Cierva {{developed}} the fully articulating rotor for the autogyro. The {{basis of his}} design permitted successful helicopter development. In a fully articulated rotor system, each rotor blade {{is attached to the}} rotor hub through a series of hinges that let the blade move independently of the others. These rotor systems usually have three or more blades. The blades are allowed to flap, feather, and lead or lag independently of each other. The horizontal hinge, called the flapping hinge, allows the blade to move up and down. This movement is called flapping and is designed to compensate for dissymmetry of lift. The flapping hinge may be located at varying distances from the rotor hub, and there may be more than one hinge. The vertical hinge, called the lead-lag hinge or drag hinge, allows the blade to move back and forth. This movement is called lead-lag, dragging, or hunting. Dampers are usually used to prevent excess back and forth movement around the drag hinge. The purpose of the drag hinge and dampers is to compensate for acceleration and deceleration caused by the Coriolis effect. Later models have switched from using traditional bearings to <b>elastomeric</b> <b>bearings.</b> <b>Elastomeric</b> <b>bearings</b> are naturally fail-safe and their wear is gradual and visible. The metal-to-metal contact of older bearings and the need for lubrication is eliminated in this design. The third hinge in the fully articulated system is called the feathering hinge about the feathering axis. This hinge is responsible for the change in pitch of rotor blades excited via pilot input to the Collective or Cyclic.A variation of the fully articulated system is the [...] "soft-in-plane" [...] rotor system. This type of rotor can be found on several aircraft produced by Bell Helicopter, such as the OH-58D Kiowa Warrior. This system is similar to the fully articulated type in that each blade has the ability to lead/lag and hunt independent of the other blades. The difference between a fully articulated system and soft-in-plane system is that the soft-in-plane system utilizes a composite yoke. This yoke is attached to the mast and runs through the blade grips between the blades and the shear bearing inside the grip. This yoke does transfer some movement of one blade to another, usually opposing blades. While this is not fully articulated, the flight characteristics are very similar and maintenance time and cost are reduced.|$|E

A special procedure accounting for the strain-rate effect of {{two different types of}} bridge isolation devices, is presented herein.

The procedure is applied to characterize the dynamic response of both, a low-damping <b>elastomeric</b> <b>bearing</b> isolator and a special electro-inductive energy dissipation device. The response of a multi-span, seismically isolated highway bridge is then experimentally studied by sub-structuring, with on-line correction of measured reaction forces to account for the velocity-dependent properties of the isolation devices.

40|$|This {{research}} {{represents a}} fundamental {{study of the}} failure mechanisms observed to occur in fiber reinforced <b>elastomeric</b> <b>bearing</b> surfaces.

It is proposed to use elastomeric composites as artificial joint bearing surfaces to increase their fluid film lubrication and therefore reduce the number of failures which have been attributed to wear mechanisms related to frictional forces. The fluid generated between the surfaces supports part of the load and prevents direct contact of the bearing surfaces. In order to obtain optimum elastohydrodynamic lubrication, elastomeric materials have been selected based on their static mechanical properties such as modulus of elasticity.
