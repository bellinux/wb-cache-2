40|$|Aromatic-aromatic {{interactions}} between phenylalanine side chains in peptides have been probed by the structure determination in crystals of three peptides: Boc-Val-Ala-Phe-Aib-Val-Ala-Phe-Aib-OMe, I; Boc-Val-Ala-Phe-Aib-Val-Ala-Phe-Aib-Val-Ala-Phe-Aib-OMe, II; Boc-Aib-Ala-Phe-Aib-Phe-Ala-Val-Aib-OMe, III. X-ray diffraction studies reveal {{that all three}} peptides adopt helical conformations in the solid state with the Phe side chains projecting outward. Interhelix association in the crystals is promoted by Phe-Phe interactions. A total of 15 unique aromatic pairs have been characterized in the three independent crystal structures. In peptides I and II, the aromatic side chains lie on the same face of the helix at ii+ 4 positions resulting in both intrahelix and interhelix aromatic interactions. In peptide III, the Phe side chains are placed on the opposite faces of the helix, resulting in exclusive intermolecular aromatic interactions. The distances between the centroids of aromatic pair ranges from 5. 11 to 6. 86 Å, while the distance of closest approach of ring carbon atoms ranges from 3. 27 to 4. 59 Å. Examples of T-shaped and parallel-displaced arrangements of aromatic pairs are observed, in addition to several examples of <b>inclined</b> <b>arrangements.</b> The results {{support the view that}} the interaction potential for a pair of aromatic rings is relatively broad and rugged with several minima of similar energies, separated by small activation barriers...|$|R
40|$|Compact heat {{exchangers}} are key components {{for the development}} of future aircraft devices. An enhancement of the heat transfer rate results in a decrease of the heat exchanger size and thus in lower weight and lower investment costs. The exact knowledge of the temperature distribution in the boundary layer is necessary for a specific augmentation of heat transfer. Holographic interferometry was applied to visualize the temperature field. This optical measuring method offers the advantage to deliver information about the temperature distribution without disturbing the flow pattern. A digital image processing system was used for the evaluation of the interferograms. The local Nusselt number was determined from the isotherms at the wall. Two different types of geometries for compact plate {{heat exchangers}} were investigated using air as test fluid: Plain fin arrangements of plate-fin heat exchangers and circular segment shaped turbulence promoters in plate heat exchangers. The test section was heated by hot water in order to obtain a constant wall temperature as thermal boundary condition. During the experiments the Reynolds number was varied between 500 and 3000, a range where low pressure losses occurred. The investigations of the plate-fin arrangements show that the Nusselt number for the geometry with 1 mm radii is about 15 % higher than that for the duct with radii of 5 mm. In the case of the circular segment shaped turbulence promoters a staggered, a non-staggered and an <b>inclined</b> <b>arrangement</b> were investigated. The overall Nusselt number shows that the non-staggered ribs lead to the best heat transfer. To compare the results with the heat transfer in a flat duct the Nusselt number distribution between parallel plates was calculated by equations taken from the literature. The present results show that an enhancement of heat transfer of 100 % for low Reynolds numbers and of approximately 300 % for Reynolds number of 2500 can be achieved. (orig.)

40|$|Artificial {{roughness}} in {{the form}} of repeated ribs is generally used for enhancement of heat transfer heated surface to the working fluid. In the present work experimental investigations has been carried out to study the effect of a gap in the inclined rib on the heat transfer and fluid flow characteristics of heated surface. A rectangular duct of aspect ratio of 5. 83 has been used to conduct experiments on one rib roughened surface. Experimental data have been collected to determine Nusselt number (heat transfer coefficient) as a function of roughness and flow parameters {{in the form}} of repeated ribs. In order to understand the mechanism of heat transfer through a roughened duct having inclined rib with and without gap, the detailed analysis of the fluid flow structure is required. Therefore the detailed velocity structures of fluid flow inside a similar roughened duct as used for the heat transfer analysis were obtained by 2 -Dimensional Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) system and the heat transfer results were correlated with the flow structure. It was found that inclined rib with a gap (inclined discrete rib) had better heat transfer performance compared to the continuous <b>inclined</b> rib <b>arrangement.</b> Further the <b>inclined</b> discrete rib with relative gap width (g/e) of 1. 0 gives the higher heat transfer performance compared to the other relative gap width...|$|R

40|$|A {{single-stage}} vertical foam {{fractionation column}} was investigated under continuous steady-state experimental conditions. Using a simple power-law expression {{to describe the}} drainage velocity through the foam, and in conjunction with continuity arguments, a theoretical framework was developed to analyse {{the performance of the}} vertical column. A reduction in the degrees of freedom in the analysis was achieved by using a fixed feed to gas flux ratio to promote a reasonably constant surfactant recovery. It was then possible to measure the process performance by determining the change in the level of enrichment produced from a change in the gas flux, and corresponding change in the feed flux. For a constant recovery, the enrichment is directly proportional to the volume reduction (defined as the ratio of the feed volume processed to foamate volume produced in a given time). The analysis was found to be consistent with experimental data and demonstrated the need to limit the gas flux, and hence the feed flux, to relatively low values in order to produce satisfactory volume reductions, and in turn achieve high enrichment. To overcome this processing constraint, three parallel inclined channels (PIC) were used to provide an effective increase in the vessel area, and hence facilitate the release of the entrained liquid within the foam. A significant increase in the volume reduction was obtained using the <b>inclined</b> channel <b>arrangement.</b> For the same processing rate, the PIC column achieved up to a 4 fold increase in enrichment compared to the vertical column. A slight decrease in recovery, however, was observed using the PIC column...|$|R
40|$|Shading {{of solar}} panels {{drastically}} reduces the solar collector’s efficiency “η ” by reducing cell power “PMP”, and altering the short circuit-current “ISC”, the open-circuit voltage “VOC”, and the fill factor “FF”. Therefore, the orientation and tilt angle of solar collectors {{play an important}} role in minimizing shading and consequently in increasing solar collector’s efficiency. A mathematical methodology including Cooper’s equation and Visual Basic Application (VBA) programming in Microsoft Excel was utilized to determine optimum tilt angles for solar collectors installed in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. The mathematical approach was devised to determine the optimal arrangement in flat fields, field with steps and inclined field. The result indicates that the worst shading effects happens during December and an optimum flat distance between solar collector rows for a flat field is 2. 66 m for a 2 m high collector meanwhile for field with steps and <b>inclined</b> field, the <b>arrangement</b> of solar panel is depended on slope or tilt angle ß which is presented in relevant graphs.

There will still be problems and challenges for China’s elderly people in the foreseeable future: low security and income level and a weak ability to resist risks; significant growth in demands for care giving and a shortage of care-giving service resources; many health risks and a heavy medical burden; increasing problems adapting living <b>arrangements</b> <b>inclined</b> to independent living and the phenomenon of the “empty nest”. For a long time, the spouse and children will be the main caregivers for elderly people. With the advent of small families and the decline in the number of children in a family, the trend for family members to take complete care of the elderly will be difficult to sustain. Because of the dramatic decline and low level in fertility during the past several decades, China has benefited notably in terms of economic and social development because of an enormous demographic dividend. However, with the closure of the opportunity window of the population, as well as increasing life expectancy, it will be very difficult for China to afford its rapidly aging population.|$|R
40|$|An {{important}} component that secures durability of composite insulators for high voltage applications {{is the quality}} of internal interfaces. Weak interfaces, in form of a reduced bonding or a loss of the adhesion between the insulation components, can be devastating for the long-term functionality of an insulator. A failure can take place years after the first signs of the appearance of ageing or weakening of the interfaces. The failure process may be accelerated by moisture ingress or even be initiated by partial discharge activity at the interfaces. The ambitions of manufacturers have therefore been directed towards designing interfaces with good and durable long-term properties that secure very low rate of ageing. However, there is insufficient knowledge about the ageing mechanisms of interfaces in composite insulators and knowledge on how the interfaces affect their durability in a long-term perspective. Moreover {{there is a lack of}} standardized ageing tests for evaluating quality of interfaces in composite insulation systems. In this work the aim has been to better understand the effects of ageing on properties and integrity of composite insulation systems containing interfacial defects. This was approached by investigating model interface objects with added artificial defects. Two different types of the objects were studied. In the first study, the <b>inclined</b> plane <b>arrangement</b> was used in a salt fog chamber to test samples produced in a manner that simulated eventual repairs performed on insulator housings of large hollow-core insulators. The interfaces studied were models of material joints obtained by two different techniques. The first type of joint was obtained by means of high temperature vulcanised silicone rubber, which, after the joint formation, was cured. The second type of joint was obtained by means of room temperature vulcanised silicone glue. To evaluate results of the tests, the changes of the tensile strength were monitored. It was found that the best long-term performance was achieved when the repair was carried out with the high temperature vulcanised rubber. The second study concentrated on evaluation of defects exhibiting insufficient adhesion at the interface between silicone rubber and epoxy resin substrate when exposed to partial discharges under dry and wet conditions. The investigations revealed that the epoxy substrate degraded since residues of epoxy resin decomposition were detected. In addition, surface cracking appeared on the silicone rubber facing the interface. This indicated formation of a silica layer on the exposed surface. Tendencies for defect growth, caused by a loss of adhesion outside of the defect area, were also observed, but this trend was not clear enough for drawing final conclusions about the effect...|$|R
