We investigated BNP and adiponectin serum levels followed by isoproterenol (ISO) administration to rats and explored the relationship between them. Cardiac troponin I (cTnI) blood level was used as biochemical evidence of myocardial damage development. Adult male Wistar rats (average body weight 273. 33 ± 21. 63 g) were distributed into groups: control group received saline (n= 6) and ISO groups (n= 12) treated with ISO (<b>subcutaneous</b> <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> 100 mg/kg of rat body weight). ISO group was divided into two groups according to the time of BNP, adiponectin and cTnI determination: ISO I (n= 6; 2 hours after ISO administration); ISO II (n= 6; 4 hours after ISO administration). Blood for determination of parameters was taken from rat abdominal aorta. BNP, adiponectin and cTnI were determined by ELISA method. Data were statistically analysed by using SPSS version 13 computer program. P value less 0. 05 was considered statistically significant. Blood BNP and adiponectin were lower at 2 hours after ISO administration in comparison with control group (p= 0. 004 for BNP and p= 0. 174 for adiponectin). Four hours after ISO administration, we have noted significant elevation of both parameters compared to ISO I group (p= 0. 004 for BNP; p= 0. 02 for adiponectin).

We have compared the activities of PCV and acyclovir (ACV) in DBA/ 2 mice infected intraperitoneally with herpes simplex virus type 1 SC 16 by measuring the amount of virus in peritoneal washings. In untreated mice after an eclipse phase, virus titers are maximum at 48 h after infection and decline thereafter. PCV and ACV reduced virus replication to a similar extent when given ad libitum in drinking water, even though ACV had better oral bioavailability and greater potency in murine cells. Thus, PCV was more active than had been predicted.

Manufactured using Chinese hamster ovary cells transfected with the human follicle-stimulating hormone gene, XM 17 has an identical amino acid sequence {{to that of the}} human protein as well as to those of the other approved {{recombinant human}} follicle-stimulating hormone products. Glycosylation patterns may differ slightly between products. The objectives of this first-in-human study were to assess the safety, tolerability, pharmacokinetics, and dose-proportionality of <b>single</b> ascending <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>doses</b> of XM 17 in healthy young female volunteers. Methods: Endogenous follicle-stimulating hormone was downregulated by implanting a 1 -month depot of goserelin acetate 3. 6 mg on day 0 in eligible subjects. On day 14 of the experimental period, subjects received one of four ascending doses of XM 17. Blood sampling to obtain the pharmacokinetic profile of XM 17 was done at frequent intervals until 168 hours post-dose. Results: Following downregulation of endogenous follicle-stimulating hormone to < 4 IU/L, 40 subjects (of mean age 29 ± 5. 4 years) received <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>doses</b> of 37. 5 (n= 4, pilot group), 75, 150, or 300 IU (n= 12 each) of XM 17. The mean serum concentration-time profiles of XM 17 revealed dose-related increases in maximum concentration (Cmax) within 24 hours followed by monoexponential decay for the three higher dose levels. Slopes estimated by linear regression for Cmax and AUC 0 – 168 h were ~ 1. 0 (0. 9052 IU/L and 1. 0964 IU·h/L, respectively). For each IU of XM 17 administered, Cmax and AUC 0 – 168 h rose by 0. 032 IU/L and 2. 60 IU·h/L, respectively. Geometric mean elimination half-life ranged from 54 to 90 hours. No antibodies to XM 17 were detected.

Amastigote burdens in liver, spleen, and bone marrow were determined either 7 days (early effects) or 56 days (late effects) after treatment. Prophylactic administration of MB-III at 0. 2 mg/kg reduced liver amastigote burdens by 99. 8 and 83 % within 7 and 56 days after treatment, respectively. In the latter group, however, all animals became ill and some died. Both MB-III at 0. 8 mg/kg and liposomal amphotericin B were 100 % effective against liver stages, but clearance from the spleen and bone marrow was not achieved. Curative administration of MB-III at 0. 2 and 0. 4 mg/kg was not protective, as no survivors were left at the termination of the experiment on day 84. Despite the high level of reduction of the liver amastigote burden after treatment with MB-III at 0. 8 mg/kg (94. 2 %) or liposomal amphotericin B (99. 4 %), clinical protection could not be obtained in either group, with two deaths occurring and the residual liver burdens persisting.

Three groups {{of six to}} seven lambs were immunized as follows: one group received the vaccine (termed rMVA-GnGc), a second group received an MVA vector (vector control) and a third group received saline solution (non-vaccinated control). Fourteen days later, all animals were subcutaneously challenged with 10 (5) TCID 50 of the virulent RVFV isolate 56 / 74 and vaccine efficacy assessed using standard endpoints. Two lambs (one from the vaccine group and one from the vector control group) succumbed to RVFV challenge, showing characteristic liver lesions. Lambs from both the vector control and non-vaccinated groups were febrile from days 2 to 5 post challenge (pc) while those in the rMVA-GnGc group showed a single peak of pyrexia at day 3 pc. RVFV RNA was detected in both nasal and oral swabs from days 3 to 7 pc in some lambs from the vector control and non-vaccinated groups, but no viral shedding could be detected in the surviving lambs vaccinated with rMVA-GnGc. Together, the data suggest that a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of the rMVA-GnGc vaccine may be sufficient to reduce RVFV shedding and duration of viremia but does not provide sterile immunity nor protection from disease. Further optimization of this vaccine approach in lambs is warranted...|$|R
40|$|Cyanohydroxybutene (CHB), a glycosinolate {{breakdown}} product, causes pancreatic injury {{when given}} to animals in large amounts. To determine {{the course of}} CHB-induced pancreatopathy, rats were given a <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of CHB and the pancreas weighed and examined by light and electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry at intervals from 2 h to 28 days. The pancreatic lesion was unusual in that there was marked early oedema with limited inflammatory cell infiltration, rapid synchronous onset of acinar cell apoptosis and early advanced atrophy engendering only a limited regenerative response. Acinar cell apoptosis was atypical in that cell fragmentation was limited and phagocytosis delayed, resulting in extensive secondary necrosis. As ducts were unaffected by CHB, the crowded ducts making up the epithelial component of atrophic lobules could be clearly shown to derive from their condensation and proliferation, not the redifferentiation of pre-existing acinar cells, widely held to produce this lesion. Although the basis of CHB selectivity and toxicity for pancreatic acinar cells remains unknown, the potential therapeutic benefit of such an agent in patients with pancreatitis or pancreatic tumours warrants further investigation...|$|R

We evaluated the pharmacokinetic properties of insulin degludec {{in subjects with}} normal renal function; mild, moderate or severe renal impairment; or end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing hemodialysis. Methods Thirty subjects (n = 6 per group) received a <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 4 U/kg insulin degludec. Blood samples up to 120 h post-dose and fractionated urine samples were collected. Results The ultra-long pharmacokinetic properties of insulin degludec were preserved in subjects with renal impairment, with {{no statistically significant differences}} in absorption or clearance, compared with subjects with normal renal function. In subjects with ESRD, pharmacokinetic parameters were similar whether the insulin degludec phar-macokinetic assessment period included hemodialysis or not, and total exposure was comparable to subjects with normal renal function. Simulated mean steady-state phar-macokinetic profiles were comparable between groups. Conclusion This study indicated dose adjustments due to impaired renal function should not be required for insulin degludec. ...|$|R

This {{article is}} {{published}} with open access at Springerlink. com Background and Objective Insulin degludec is a basal insulin {{with a slow}} and distinct absorption mechanism resulting in an ultra-long, flat, and stable pharmacokinetic profile in patients with diabetes mellitus. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the effect of hepatic impairment on the single-dose pharmacokinetics of insulin degludec. Methods Twenty-four subjects, allocated to one of four groups (n = 6 per group) based on level of hepatic impairment (normal hepatic function, Child–Pugh grade A, B, or C), were administered a <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of 0. 4 U/kg insulin degludec. Blood samples up to 120 h post-dose and fractionated urine samples were collected to measure pharmacokinetic parameters. Results No difference was observed in pharmacokinetic parameters [area under the 120 -h serum insulin degludec concentration–time curve (AUC 120 h), maximum insulin degludec concentration (Cmax), and apparent clearance (CL/ F) ] for subjects with impaired versus normal hepatic func-tion after a <b>single</b> <b>dose</b> of insulin degludec. The geometric mean [coefficient of variation (CV) %] AUC 120 h values were 89, 092 (16), 83, 327 (15), 88, 944 (23), and 79, 846 (19) pmolh/L for normal hepatic function and mild, moderate, and severe hepatic impairment, respectively. Simulated steady-state insulin degludec pharmacokinetic profiles showed an even distribution of exposure across a 24 -h dosing interval regardless of hepatic function status. Conclusions The ultra-long pharmacokinetic properties of insulin degludec were preserved in subjects with hepatic impairment and there were no statistically significant dif-ferences in absorption or clearance compared with subjects with normal hepatic function. ...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND METHODS: The {{immunomodulatory}} {{activity of}} a synbiotic combination containing three bacterial strains (Lactobacillus helveticus R 0052, Bifidobacterium longum subsp. infantis R 0033 and Bifidobacterium bifidum R 0071) and short-chain fructooligosaccharide was examined in two distinct infectious rat models. In the T(h) 1 model, Wistar rats were administered the synbiotic combination for 2 {{weeks prior to}} challenge with a <b>single</b> oral <b>dose</b> of enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli or vehicle. In the T(h) 2 model, pretreated rats were challenged with a <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of hook worm, Nippostrongylus brasiliensis. Blood samples were collected 3 hours or 4 days postchallenge and serum levels of pro- and anti-inflammatory cytokines were measured. RESULTS: Significant reductions in pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL) - 1 α, IL- 1 β, IL- 6, and tumour necrosis factor (TNF) -α were observed in both models suggesting a single, unifying mode of action on an upstream regulator. The N. brasiliensis study also compared {{the effect of the}} individual strains to synbiotic. For most of cytokines the combination appeared to average the effect of the individual strains with the exception of IL- 4 and IL- 10 where there was apparent synergy for the combination. Furthermore, the cytokine response varied by strain. CONCLUSIONS: It was concluded that this synbiotic combination of these three microbes could be beneficial in both T(h) 1 and T(h) 2 disease...|$|R
40|$|Ochratoxins A and B {{were given}} to 1 -day-old Babcock B- 300 cockerels to {{evaluate}} acute toxic effects. Two trials with ochratoxin A gave 7 -day oral median lethal dose estimates of 116 μg (3. 3 mg/kg) and 135 μg (3. 9 mg/kg) per chick. Chicks given daily oral doses of 100 μg of ochratoxin A died on the second day. <b>Single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>doses</b> of 400 μg of ochratoxin A were also lethal. The 7 -day oral median lethal dose of B was estimated at 1, 890 μg (54 mg/kg) per chick. Chicks given oral doses of 100 μg of ochratoxin B daily for 10 days survived. Sublethal doses of both ochratoxins A and B resulted in growth suppression which was proportional {{to the amount of}} ochratoxin given. Visceral gout was the principal gross finding. Microscopic examinations revealed acute nephrosis, hepatic degeneration or focal necrosis, and enteritis.

The present investigation reveals the rational of the beneficial effects of the natural compound C-phycocyanin (C-PC) is beneficial when administered to rat pups to protect against the secondary effects of sodium selenite induced cataractogenesis. A <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of sodium selenite (19  μmol/kg body weight) on the 10 th day of postpartum is adequate to induce cataract in rat pups. Serum biochemical parameters, such as the level of electrolytes, mean activities of anti-oxidant enzymes i.e. superoxide dismutase, catalase and reduced glutathione were observed to be significantly altered during selenite induced cataractogenic process. Histopathological examination revealed signs of degradation of normal cell architecture in the liver, kidney and eye lens. Interestingly, the deleterious effects of sodium selenite toxicity were restored with the simultaneous treatment with C-PC. The results suggest that an administration of 200  mg/kg body weight of C-PC has the ability to prevent/alter the secondary changes reflected in the serum biochemical and histological modifications in rats exposed to sodium selenite. These results complement the beneficial role of C-PC of cyanobacterial origin as a efficacious anti-cataractogenic agent against sodium selenite toxicity.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effect on litter size of 2 analgesics used perioperatively during mouse embryo transfer surgery. Day 2. 5 pseudopregnant CD 1 mice (n = 96) were divided equally into 2 analgesic treatment groups and a saline control group. Each mouse received a <b>single,</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dose</b> of buprenorphine hydrochloride (0. 1 mg/kg), flunixin meglumine (2. 5 mg/kg), or saline immediately after induction of anesthesia with 2. 5 % isoflurane. Each mouse then was prepared for aseptic surgery. Blastocysts had previously been collected from C 57 BL/ 6 NCrl female mice that were synchronized and superovulated by using pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin and mated with C 57 BL/ 6 NTac male mice 3. 5 d before collection. Viable blastocysts were pooled, and 8 were selected arbitrarily and transplanted into the right uterine horn of each pseudopregnant CD 1 mouse. Mice were monitored throughout pregnancy, and the number of pups at birth was documented. No statistically significant difference was found between the 3 groups. These results indicate that perioperative analgesic treatment with buprenorphine or flunixin in the CD 1 mouse undergoing embryo transfer is not associated with increased embryonic loss...|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel translation inhibitor that has anti-dengue virus (DENV) activity in vitro and in vivo. The inhibitor was identified through a high-throughput screening using a DENV infection assay. The compound contains a benzomorphan core structure. Mode-of-action {{analysis indicated that}} the compound inhibits protein translation in a viral RNA sequence-independent manner. Analysis of the stereochemistry demonstrated that only one enantiomer of the racemic compound inhibits viral RNA translation. Medicinal chemistry was performed to eliminate a metabolically labile glucuronidation site of the compound to improve its in vivo stability. Pharmacokinetic analysis showed that upon a <b>single</b> <b>subcutaneous</b> <b>dosing</b> of 25 mg/kg of body weight in mice, plasma levels of the compound reached a Cmax (maximum plasma drug concentration) above the protein-binding-adjusted 90 % effective concentration (EC 90) value of 0. 96 μM. In agreement with the in vivo pharmacokinetic results, treatment of DENV-infected mice with 25 mg/kg of compound once per day reduced peak viremia by about 40 -fold. However, mice treated with 75 mg/kg of compound per day exhibited adverse effects. Collectively, our results demonstrate that the benzomorphan compounds inhibit DENV through suppression of RNA translation. The therapeutic window of the current compounds needs to be improved for further development...|$|R
