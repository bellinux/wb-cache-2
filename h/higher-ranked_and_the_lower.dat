Using groupoid techniques, we define <b>the</b> Toeplitz <b>and</b> Cuntz-Krieger algebras of topological <b>higher-rank</b> graphs, <b>and</b> show that <b>the</b> $C^*$-algebras defined are coherent with the existing theory.

40|$|We {{consider}} a free action of an Ore semigroup on a <b>higher-rank</b> graph, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> induced action by endomorphisms of the $C^*$-algebra of the graph. We {{show that the}} crossed product by this action is stably isomorphic to the $C^*$-algebra of a quotient graph. Our main tool is Laca's dilation theory for endomorphic actions of Ore semigroups on $C^*$-algebras, which embeds such an action in an automorphic action of the enveloping group on a larger $C^*$-algebra.

40|$|Bidirectional typechecking {{has become}} a popular {{technique}} for advanced type systems. In this paper, I show how to extend past work on bidirectional typechecking to handle parametric polymorphism bidirectionally. The first key contribution is a simple bidirectional type system that supports first-class (<b>higher-rank</b> <b>and</b> impredicative) polymorphism; its algorithm is complete for predicative polymorphism (including ML-style polymorphism <b>and</b> <b>higher-rank</b> polymorphism). <b>The</b> second key contribution extends that system with subtyping; the combination of bidirectional typechecking with intersection and union types fortuitously yields a simple but fairly powerful algorithm. Both of these systems, inspired by Cardelli’s early work on System F<:, rely on a “greedy ” method for finding polymorphic instances. Finally, I present a more powerful algorithm that forms intersections and unions automatically. ...|$|R

50|$|The {{first phase}} {{is a group}} stage in which the twelve invited teams are divided into three groups of four teams. Similar to the Algarve Cup, the teams in Group A and Group B consist of <b>higher-ranked</b> teams <b>and</b> are <b>the</b> only teams {{actually}} in contention for the championship; Group C consists of lower-ranked teams. Each group plays a round-robin of six games, with each team playing one match against {{each of the other}} teams in the same group.|$|R

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with stochastic differential games (SDGs) defined through fully coupled forward-backward stochastic differential equations (FBSDEs) which are governed by Brownian motion and Poisson random measure. For SDGs, <b>the</b> upper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> value functions are defined by the controlled fully coupled FBSDEs with jumps. Using a new transformation introduced in [6], we prove that <b>the</b> upper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> value functions are deterministic. Then, after establishing the dynamic programming principle for <b>the</b> upper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> value functions of this SDGs, we prove that <b>the</b> upper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> value functions are the viscosity solutions to <b>the</b> associated upper <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman-Isaacs (HJBI) equations, respectively. Furthermore, for a special case (when σ, h do not depend on y, z, k), under the Isaacs' condition, we get {{the existence of the}} value of the game. Comment: 33 page...|$|R

30|$|In this paper, {{as shown}} in Fig.  2, we found a {{relationship}} between EPBs <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> atmosphere, <b>and</b> <b>the</b> relationship was much clearer {{at an altitude of}} 40  km. <b>The</b> enhanced temperature <b>and</b> wind velocity fluctuations in Fig.  5 well exceed the standard deviation for each data point. We believe that the present study has found clearer evidence of a relationship between EPB activity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> atmosphere than any of the research results described above. We suggest that the relationship between <b>the</b> EPB signal <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> atmosphere is complicated and requires an appropriate analysis technique to elucidate it. Further research is also necessary to improve the detection of this complicated link between <b>the</b> EPB activity <b>and</b> <b>the</b> <b>lower</b> atmosphere.|$|R
