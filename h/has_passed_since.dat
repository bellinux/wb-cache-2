5|$|Data {{determines that}} the only way to restore the realities is to send Worf via shuttlecraft to the Enterprise of his universe, passing through the fissure and using the shuttlecraft's engines to reseal it. After {{locating}} the correct ship, Worf begins to travel back but is attacked by another Enterprise that has come from a Borg-overrun universe, its crew refusing to return. The Enterprise that he left fires upon the hostile ship and destroys it. Worf safely passes through the fissure, finding himself back in normality with a single Enterprise in front of him. After boarding, Worf finds that no time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> he initially entered the fissure. When he returns to his room expecting a surprise party, he finds only Troi waiting to give him a single present and, knowing that the two are married in many alternate universes, he invites her to share dinner with him.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the serious}} nature of {{adultery}} in Jewish law, an agunah is forbidden to marry another man, regardless of the circumstances, whether accidental or malicious, that left her an agunah in the first place, or {{the amount of time}} that <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> she first became an agunah. A child born from another man to an agunah is considered a mamzer (halakhically illegitimate), and may only marry another mamzer or a convert.|$|E
25|$|Bite mark {{analysis}} is also controversial because dental profiles {{are subject to}} change.

25|$|More {{than a year}} <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the {{previous}} book, The Darkest Hour. Bramblepaw, Tigerstar's son, has received his warrior name, Brambleclaw. Firestar has had two kits with Sandstorm, named Squirrelpaw and Leafpaw. Squirrelpaw is apprenticed to Dustpelt, and Leafpaw is apprenticed to Cinderpelt, in training {{to become the next}} medicine cat of ThunderClan. While Leafpaw and Cinderpelt search for herbs, StarClan, the cats' ancestors, sends Cinderpelt an ominous warning in some burning bracken, a picture of a tiger running through fire, which she interprets to mean that fire and tiger will destroy the forest. Cinderpelt concludes that the warning must be about Squirrelpaw and Brambleclaw, the daughter of Firestar and the son of Tigerstar. They share the warning with Firestar, who later decides to keep Brambleclaw and Squirrelpaw separated.|$|E
25|$|The band {{continued}} {{to take a}} more commercial direction. Innocence Is No Excuse released in 1985, created a division amongst fans as the band's once raw, heavy sound had been watered down to gain more attraction to the large US market. The album has, however, gained more appreciation both from fans and critics as time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> its initial release. A huge sold out world tour in support of the album followed, but tensions began to appear within the band and by early 1986, bassist Steve Dawson was fired from the band, and Saxon was forced to record their eighth studio album Rock the Nations without a replacement bassist. With Elton John making guest appearances as pianist on 2 tracks, and Byford recording the bass parts, the album charted higher than its predecessor and was considered a success. They hired bassist Paul Johnson to play for the band's European arena tour that followed.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian {{census data}} (PNAD, 1999) {{indicate}} that 2.55 million 10-14 year-olds were illegally holding jobs. They {{were joined by}} 3.7 million 15-17 year-olds and about 375,000 5-9 year-olds. Due to the raised age restriction of 14, {{at least half of}} the recorded young workers had been employed illegally which lead to many not being protect by important labour laws. Although substantial time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the time of regulated child labour, there is still a large number of children working illegally in Brazil. Many children are used by drug cartels to sell and carry drugs, guns, and other illegal substances because of their perception of innocence. This type of work that youth are taking part in is very dangerous due to the physical and psychological implications that come with these jobs. Yet despite the hazards that come with working with drug dealers, there has been an increase in this area of employment throughout the country.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{begins by}} recounting {{the time that}} <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> the First World War: generations have come and gone, and {{technology}} continues to advance and spread from Europe and America {{over the rest of}} the world.

At {{the same time that it}} sees radical technological innovations, Europe suffers declining birth rates and experiences waves of mass migration from Africa. In an effort to maintain their rule, the ruling Senates of Europe agree to restrict the public's access to science and technology. London is the leading power in the west, and [...] "India-Japan-China" [...] is the other world power.|$|E

500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by British singer-songwriter Leona Lewis for her third studio album Glassheart (2012). It was written by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and produced by Josh Abrahams, Ammo and Oligee. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles and is a power ballad, incorporating a piano and synth-driven melody. The lyrics consist of Lewis informing her past lover that enough time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> their relationship {{for her to have}} moved on and to have developed as a person. Critics praised Lewis' vocal performance, likening her technical abilities to those of Mariah Carey and Whitney Houston. The musical structure of the song was heavily compared to one of her previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", along with songs performed by Adele. The accompanying music video shows Lewis trying to escape from a giant bird cage.|$|E
500|$|This {{primordial}} singularity {{is itself}} sometimes called [...] "the Big Bang", but the term can also {{refer to a}} more generic early hot, dense phase of the universe.

500|$|... "Lovebird" [...] {{was written}} by Bonnie McKee, Joshua Coleman and Dr. Luke, and {{produced}} by Josh Abrahams, Oligee, and Coleman (under his production name, Ammo). The song was engineered by Ryan Williams, assisted by Daniela Rivera. [...] "Lovebird" [...] was mixed by Phil Tan at the Ninja Beat Club in Atlanta, Georgia and mastered by Colin Leonard at SING Mastering using SING Technology, both located in Atlanta. The song was recorded at Pulse Recording in Los Angeles. [...] "Lovebird" [...] is a power ballad of three minutes and thirty seconds. The song's musical structure bears strong resemblances to one of Lewis' previous singles, [...] "Bleeding Love", from her début studio album Spirit (2007). The track opens with a piano introduction similar to that on [...] "Bleeding Love", and features an [...] "instantly hummable chorus". Lewis informs her lover in the lyrics – with the lines [...] "But the time went on, the wind has blown, and I have grown" [...] – that enough time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> their relationship started {{for her to have}} developed as a person. As power ballad beats and [...] "airy synths" [...] play, she sings [...] "Your lovebird's flying away/ Cos my heart's been stuck in a cage". The hook consists of Lewis singing [...] "I've got to sing my song, so pretty/ Dum, dum, diddy".|$|E

500|$|Henry Johnson survives, however, {{under the}} watchful eye of Dr. Trescott, who treats the injured man out of {{gratitude}} for saving his son's life. [...] Hagenthorpe, a leading figure in town, urges Trescott to let Henry die, stating that he [...] "will hereafter be a monster, a perfect monster, and probably with an affected brain. No man can observe you as I have observed you and not know that it was a matter of conscience with you, but I am afraid, my friend, that it is one of the blunders of virtue." [...] Ultimately Trescott decides to move Henry, who has sustained disfiguring injuries to his face and psyche, to a local negro household, but Henry's presence proves troubling for the family's well-being, and he is moved to another. [...] One night Henry absconds, visiting various people around town and leaving terrified neighbors in his wake, including Bella Farragut, who he attempts to court as if no time <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> they last met. [...] Not welcome anywhere else, Henry is eventually moved to the carriage-house in the newly built Trescott home. [...] Despite Dr. Trescott's protection, Henry is branded a monster by the townspeople, who avoid the Trescotts as a result. [...] Although previously Henry's friend, Jimmie now mocks him, daring his friends to approach the disfigured man. [...] Once the leading doctor in Whilomville, Trescott's reputation suffers greatly, as does that of his wife, who no longer receives visitors.|$|E

2500|$|For many {{geologic}} applications, isotope {{ratios of}} radioactive elements are measured in minerals {{that give the}} amount of time that <b>has</b> <b>passed</b> <b>since</b> a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium-lead dating, potassium-argon dating, argon-argon dating and uranium-thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide absolute age data for sedimentary rock units which do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement.|$|E
