50|$|Because of {{financial}} market imperfections, financial integration in neighboring, regional and/or global economies is therefore imperfect. For example, the imperfect financial integration can {{stem from the}} inequality of the marginal rate of substitutions of different agents. In addition to financial market imperfections, legal restrictions can also hinder financial integration. Therefore, financial integration can also be achieved from the elimination of restrictions pertaining to cross-border financial operations to allow (a) financial institutions to operate freely, (b) permit businesses to directly raise funds or borrow and (c) equity and bond investors to invest across the state line with fewer without imposing any restrictions. However, {{it is important to}} note that many of the legal restrictions exist because of the market imperfections that hinder financial integration. Legal restrictions are sometimes second-best devices for dealing with the market imperfections that limit financial integration. Consequently, removing the legal restrictions can make the world economy become worse off.In addition, financial integration of neighboring, regional and/or global economies can take place through a formal international treaty which the governing bodies of these economies agree to cooperate to address regional and/or global financial disturbances through regulatory and policy responses. The extent to which financial integration is measured includes gross capital flows, stocks of foreign assets and liabilities, degree of co-movement of stock returns, <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> of world-wide real interest rates, and financial openness. Also there are views that not gross capital flows (capital inflow plus capital outflow), but bilateral capital flows determine financial integration of a country, which disregards capital surplus and capital deficit amounts.

Most previous studies require the specification of a minimum correlation thresh-old to perform the computation.

To this end, in this paper, we propose an alternative task: finding the top-k strongly correlated pairs.

Our experimental results show that TOP-COP can be an order of magnitude faster than alternative approaches for mining the top-k strongly correlated pairs. Finally, we show that the performance of the TOP-COP algorithm is tightly related to the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> data <b>dispersion.</b> Indeed, the higher the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> data <b>dispersion,</b> the larger the computational savings achieved by the TOP-COP algorithm...|$|R

Colloidal systems consisting of CNTs with varying <b>degrees</b> <b>of</b> <b>dispersion</b> are prepared and characterized to evaluate CNT dispersibility and suspension stability in solvents with different polarities. The results show that an absolute value of zeta potential at about 25 mV is closely related to the micro- and macroscopic <b>dispersion</b> <b>of</b> CNTs, whereas a high absolute value of 40 mV is regarded as an indication of high quality CNT dispersion with much enhanced suspension stability in solvents. The absolute zeta potential value increases consistently with increasing <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> CNT functionality, the increase being most pronounced in a hydrophilic liquid such as water. A linear correlation is established between the surface energy of a CNT film and the oxygen to carbon ratio of CNT surface. The CNT dispersibility in a liquid is determined not only by their physical states, but also by the hydrophilicity and surface functionality of CNTs, all of which are reflected by zeta potential.
