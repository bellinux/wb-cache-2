5|$|Both non-{{selective}} <b>glucocorticoids</b> {{and selective}} glucocorticoid receptor agonists work by binding to and activating the glucocorticoid receptor (GR). In contrast to <b>glucocorticoids,</b> which activate the GR {{to work through}} (at least) two signal transduction pathways, SEGRAMs activate the GR {{in such a way}} that it only operates through one of the two main possible pathways.|$|E

5|$|Just like <b>glucocorticoids,</b> SEGRAMs bind to and {{activate}} GR. However, {{in contrast}} to <b>glucocorticoids,</b> SEGRAMs selectively activate the GR {{in such a way}} that they yield an improved therapeutic benefit. Generally, for specific inflammation-based diseases, SEGRAMs should more strongly transrepress than transactivate, or better yet solely transrepress and fail to transactivate. This type of selective GR activation should result in fewer side effects than the expected side effects that appear with a chronic treatment with classic <b>glucocorticoids.</b>|$|E
40|$|Introduction: <b>Glucocorticoid</b> {{resistance}} due to mutations of the <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor (NR 3 C 1) are rare, but reduced <b>glucocorticoid</b> sensitivity {{may play}} a role in steroid-resistant asthma, inflammatory bowel disease, and septic shock.

40|$|Assessment of steroid {{receptor}} {{content in}} human neoplastic lymphoid cells or mammary tumour cells {{has been previously}} used to predict steroid sensitivity in various types of cancers. In the present study, we have evaluated the relationship between <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor content and the <b>glucocorticoid</b> sensitivity of human eosinophils, since hypereosinophilic patients do not always respond favourably to <b>glucocorticoid,</b> particularly in the hypereosinophilic syndrome (HES). Blood or alveolar eosinophils obtained from seven patients (four with HES without leukaemic markers; two with parasitic diseases; and one with eosinophilic pneumonia) displayed the same specific <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor content as normal eosinophils (7. 58 +/- 1. 31 x 10 (3) versus 7. 76 +/- 0. 74 x 10 (3) sites/cell). In contrast, glucocorticoid-binding sites were undetectable in purified eosinophils collected from seven HES patients with (n = 3) or without (n = 4) leukaemic markers, whilst their mononuclear cells and/or neutrophils bound <b>glucocorticoid.</b> In one HES patient, kinetic studies showed that blood eosinophils initially positive in <b>glucocorticoid</b> binding assays became negative with the subsequent appearance of leukaemic markers. The absence of specific <b>glucocorticoid</b> binding sites was correlated with the absence of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor proteins {{by the use of}} a specific anti-glucocorticoid receptor monoclonal antibody. Eosinophil sensitivity to <b>glucocorticoid</b> was investigated by the evaluation of <b>glucocorticoid</b> inhibition of eosinophil chemotaxis and by the clinical outcome of in vivo <b>glucocorticoid</b> therapy. Our data provide evidence of the heterogeneity of eosinophil <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor expression. In addition, the presence of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptors is a prerequisite for <b>glucocorticoid</b> activity, in vitro and in vivo, on cells of the eosinophil lineage...|$|R

5|$|Adrenal {{insufficiency}} (the {{deficiency of}} <b>glucocorticoids)</b> occurs in about 5 in 10,000 {{in the general}} population. Diseases classified as primary adrenal insufficiency (including Addison's disease and genetic causes) directly affect the adrenal cortex. If a problem that affects the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis arises outside the gland, it is a secondary adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
5|$|Cortisol is {{the main}} {{glucocorticoid}} in humans. In species that do not create cortisol, this role is played by corticosterone instead. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> have many effects on metabolism. As their name suggests, they increase the circulating level of glucose. This {{is the result of}} an increase in the mobilization of amino acids from protein and the stimulation of synthesis of glucose from these amino acids in the liver. In addition, they increase the levels of free fatty acids, which cells can use as an alternative to glucose to obtain energy. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> also have effects unrelated to the regulation of blood sugar levels, including the suppression of the immune system and a potent anti-inflammatory effect. Cortisol reduces the capacity of osteoblasts to produce new bone tissue and decreases the absorption of calcium in the gastrointestinal tract.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} RU 486 and S-P, a more {{selective}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor antagonist from Schering-Plough, were investigated on <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation and DNA binding. In the in vitro study, AtT 20 cells {{were treated with}} vehicle or with RU 486, S-P or corticosterone (3 – 300 [*]nM) or co-treated with vehicle or <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor antagonists (3 – 300 [*]nM) and 30 [*]nM corticosterone. Both <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor antagonists induced <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation but only RU 486 induced DNA binding. RU 486 potentiated the effect of corticosterone on <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation and DNA binding, S-P inhibited corticosterone-induced <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation, but not <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor-DNA binding. In the in vivo study, adrenalectomized rats were treated with vehicle, RU 486 (20 [*]mg/kg) and S-P (50 [*]mg/kg) alone or in combination with corticosterone (3 [*]mg/kg). RU 486 induced <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation in the pituitary, hippocampus and prefrontal cortex and <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor-DNA binding in the hippocampus, whereas no effect of S-P on <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor nuclear translocation or DNA binding was observed {{in any of the}} areas analysed. These findings reveal differential effects of RU 486 and S-P on areas involved in regulation of hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis activity in vivo and they are important in light of the potential use of this class of compounds in the treatment of disorders associated with hyperactivity of the hypothalamic–pituitary–adrenal axis...|$|R
40|$|Lymphocyte <b>glucocorticoid</b> {{receptor}} binding parameters were studied in 15 severely depressed patients during depression and after clinical recovery, and in 15 healthy controls. There {{was no difference}} in <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor number or affinity between depressed patients and recovered or control subjects. Afternoon ACTH and cortisol concentrations did not differ significantly between the three groups. No relationship could be established between <b>glucocorticoid</b> {{receptor binding}} and antidepressant medication. These data support the view of an impaired ligand-induced plasticity of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor regulation rather than the hypothesis of decreased <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor numbers during depression...|$|R
5|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> {{have been}} found to be as {{effective}} as NSAIDs and may be used if contraindications exist for NSAIDs. They also lead to improvement when injected into the joint. A joint infection must be excluded, however, as steroids worsen this condition.|$|E
5|$|TRH is {{secreted}} at {{an increased}} rate in situations such as cold exposure {{in order to}} stimulate thermogenesis. In addition to being suppressed {{by the presence of}} thyroid hormones, TSH production is blunted by dopamine, somatostatin, and <b>glucocorticoids.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{adrenal cortex}} {{produces}} three main types of steroid hormones: mineralocorticoids, <b>glucocorticoids,</b> and androgens. Mineralocorticoids (such as aldosterone) {{produced in the}} zona glomerulosa help in the regulation of blood pressure and electrolyte balance. The <b>glucocorticoids</b> cortisol and corticosterone are synthesized in the zona fasciculata; their functions include the regulation of metabolism and immune system suppression. The innermost layer of the cortex, the zona reticularis, produces androgens that are converted to fully functional sex hormones in the gonads and other target organs. The production of steroid hormones is called steroidogenesis, and involves a number of reactions and processes {{that take place in}} cortical cells. The medulla produces the catecholamines adrenaline and noradrenaline, which function to produce a rapid response throughout the body in stress situations.|$|E
50|$|Another {{indicator}} of fitness is {{the levels of}} <b>glucocorticoid.</b> <b>Glucocorticoid</b> release is considered beneficial in helping animals survive stressful conditions, while low <b>glucocorticoid</b> levels are an {{indicator of}} poor body condition. Species undergoing a large measure of stress, resulting in elevated <b>glucocorticoid</b> levels can cause complications such as reproduction failure. Human activity has been considered a cause of elevated levels of <b>glucocorticoid</b> in species. Results of a study show that marine iguanas in areas central to tourism are not chronically stressed, but do show lower stress response compared to groups undisturbed by tourism. Tourism, thus, does affect the physiology of marine iguanas. Information of <b>glucocorticoid</b> levels are good monitors in predicting long term consequences of human impact.|$|R
40|$|<b>Glucocorticoid</b> {{therapy has}} been linked to {{increased}} risk of development of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), which has become epidemic among HIV-infected individuals. However, no experimental evidence is available to explain the role of <b>glucocorticoid</b> in KS biopathology. We investigated the direct effect of dexamethasone (Dex) on the growth of cultured KS cells derived from acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients (AIDS-KS). Dex significantly stimulated the proliferation of AIDS-KS cells. Moreover, simultaneous exposure to Dex and oncostatin M, a KS major cytokine, produced a dramatic synergistic effect on proliferation of AIDS-KS cell. This suggests an interaction between <b>glucocorticoid</b> and growth factor intracellular pathways in KS cells. The expression of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor protein and mRNA in AIDS-KS cell cultures was examined by radioimmunoassay and in situ hybridization, respectively. Compared with other well studied cell lines, AIDS-KS cells contain an unusually high level of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor protein, which is further upregulated by <b>glucocorticoid</b> treatment. RU- 486, a <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor antagonist, completely abolished the stimulatory effect of Dex and reduced the synergistic effect of Dex and oncostatin M on proliferation of AIDS-KS. These findings demonstrate that <b>glucocorticoid</b> stimulates directly the proliferation of AIDS-KS cells via the modulation of <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor expression...|$|R

5|$|The {{adrenal medulla}} {{is derived from}} neural crest cells, which come from the {{ectoderm}} layer of the embryo. These cells migrate from their initial position and aggregate {{in the vicinity of}} the dorsal aorta, a primitive blood vessel, which activates the differentiation of these cells through the release of proteins known as BMPs. These cells then undergo a second migration from the dorsal aorta to form the adrenal medulla and other organs of the sympathetic nervous system. Cells of the adrenal medulla are called chromaffin cells because they contain granules that stain with chromium salts, a characteristic not present in all sympathetic organs. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> produced in the adrenal cortex were once thought to be responsible for the differentiation of chromaffin cells. More recent research suggests that BMP-4 secreted in adrenal tissue is the main responsible for this, and that <b>glucocorticoids</b> only play a role in the subsequent development of the cells.|$|E
5|$|Anti-inflammatory {{drugs are}} often used to control the effects of inflammation. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> are the most {{powerful}} of these drugs; however, these drugs can have many undesirable side effects, such as central obesity, hyperglycemia, osteoporosis, and their use must be tightly controlled. Lower doses of anti-inflammatory drugs {{are often used}} in conjunction with cytotoxic or immunosuppressive drugs such as methotrexate or azathioprine.|$|E
5|$|Current {{preclinical}} {{tests show}} that the SEGRAMs available so far would elicit fewer side effect or at least less grave side effects than classic <b>glucocorticoids</b> would. For example, skin atrophy in rats was significantly less pronounced than under prednisolone in a study using the SEGRAM Mapracorat, and metabolic effects like weight gain or increase of blood glucose were practically inexistent.|$|E
5|$|Selective <b>glucocorticoid</b> {{receptor}} modulators (SEGRMs) {{and selective}} <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor agonists (SEGRAs) {{formerly known as}} dissociated <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor agonists (DIGRAs) are a class of experimental drugs designed to share many of the desirable anti-inflammatory, immunosuppressive, or anticancer properties of classical <b>glucocorticoid</b> drugs but with fewer side effects such as skin atrophy. Although preclinical evidence on SEGRAMs’ anti-inflammatory effects are culminating, currently, the efficacy of these SEGRAMs on cancer are largely unknown.|$|R

Therefore, we {{examined the relationship between}} circulating <b>glucocorticoid</b> levels, hepatic IFN-γ expression, and hepatic T cell <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor (GR) expression in a rat model of cholangitis to provide insight into the possible mechanism underlying hepatic T cell <b>glucocorticoid</b> resistance in cholangitic diseases...|$|R
40|$|Tyrosine aminotransferase (TAT) gene {{transcription}} is specifically activated by <b>glucocorticoid</b> hormones in liver cells. This regulation involves a <b>glucocorticoid</b> responsive region located 2, 500 bases upstream from the transcription start {{site of the}} rate gene. By transient transfection of TAT-CAT fusion genes into a rat hepatoma cell line expressing the TAT gene we found that this region promotes only 30 % of the <b>glucocorticoid</b> stimulation. We have identified a new cis-acting region far upstream (- 5, 400) from the transcription start site that is essential to achieve the physiological level of <b>glucocorticoid</b> stimulation of endogenous TAT gene expression. This region corresponds to a tissue-specific DNAse I hypersensitive site which is constitutive despite the fact it possesses a <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor binding site.

5|$|SFTPA2 {{is located}} in the long arm of {{chromosome}} 10, close to SFTPA1. The SFTPA2 gene is 4556 base pairs in length, and 94% similar to SFTPA1. The structure of SFTPA2 consists of four coding exons (I-IV), and several 5'UTR untranslated exons (A, B, B’, C, C’, D, D’). The expression of SFTPA2 is regulated by cellular factors including proteins, small RNAs (microRNAs), <b>glucocorticoids,</b> etc. Its expression is also regulated by epigenetic and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|The zona fasciculata is {{situated}} between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. Cells in this layer {{are responsible for}} producing <b>glucocorticoids</b> such as cortisol.

5|$|Catecholamines are {{produced}} in chromaffin {{cells in the}} medulla of the adrenal gland, from tyrosine, a non-essential amino acid derived from food or produced from phenylalanine in the liver. The enzyme tyrosine hydroxylase converts tyrosine to L-DOPA in {{the first step of}} catecholamine synthesis. L-DOPA is then converted to dopamine before it can be turned into noradrenaline. In the cytosol, noradrenaline is converted to epinephrine by the enzyme phenylethanolamine N-methyltransferase (PNMT) and stored in granules. <b>Glucocorticoids</b> produced in the adrenal cortex stimulate the synthesis of catecholamines by increasing the levels of tyrosine hydroxylase and PNMT.|$|E
40|$|<b>Glucocorticoid</b> {{resistance}} {{is a major}} driver of therapeutic failure in Tcell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL). Here, we identify the AKT 1 kinase as a major negative regulator of the NR 3 C 1 <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor protein activity driving <b>glucocorticoid</b> resistance in T-ALL. Mechanistically, AKT 1 impairs glucocorticoid-induced gene expression by direct phosphorylation of NR 3 C 1 at position S 134 and blocking glucocorticoid-induced NR 3 C 1 translocation to the nucleus. Moreover, we demonstrate that loss of PTEN and consequent AKT 1 activation can effectively block glucocorticoid-induced apoptosis and induce resistance to <b>glucocorticoid</b> therapy. Conversely, pharmacologic inhibition of AKT with MK 2206 effectively restores glucocorticoid-induced NR 3 C 1 translocation to the nucleus, increases the response of T-ALL cells to <b>glucocorticoid</b> therapy, and effectively reverses <b>glucocorticoid</b> resistance invitro and inviv...|$|R

40|$|Background—Glucocorticoid {{resistant}} or insensitive asthmatic {{subjects are}} usually defined as patients whose baseline pre-bronchodilation {{forced expiratory volume}} in one second (FEV 1) of less than 70 – 80 % predicted improves significantly in re-sponse to â 2 agonists but by less than 15 % following 1 – 2 weeks of 40 mg prednisolone daily. Since there is little long term clinical information on these patients, a one year prospective study was performed to assess whether <b>glucocorticoid</b> sensitiv-ity may vary over time. Methods—Nineteen severe asthmatic sub-jects were studied and received 40 mg prednisolone daily for seven days.

5|$|Cushing's {{syndrome}} is {{the manifestation of}} glucocorticoid excess. It can {{be the result of}} a prolonged treatment with <b>glucocorticoids</b> or be caused by an underlying disease which produces alterations in the HPA axis or the production of cortisol. Causes can be further classified into ACTH-dependent or ACTH-independent. The most common cause of endogenous Cushing's {{syndrome is}} a pituitary adenoma which causes an excessive production of ACTH. The disease produces a wide variety of signs and symptoms which include obesity, diabetes, increased blood pressure, excessive body hair (hirsutism), osteoporosis, depression and, most distinctively, stretch marks in the skin, caused by its progressive thinning.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glucocorticoids</b> {{are under}} the {{regulatory}} influence of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis. Glucocorticoid synthesis is stimulated by adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), a hormone released into the bloodstream by the anterior pituitary. In turn, production of ACTH is stimulated {{by the presence of}} corticotropin-releasing hormone (CRH), which is released by neurons of the hypothalamus. ACTH acts on the adrenal cells first by increasing the levels of StAR within the cells, and then of all steroidogenic P450 enzymes. The HPA axis {{is an example of a}} negative feedback system, in which cortisol itself acts as a direct inhibitor of both CRH and ACTH synthesis. The HPA axis also interacts with the immune system through increased secretion of ACTH at the presence of certain molecules of the inflammatory response.|$|E
5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} <b>glucocorticoids</b> {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The {{treatment}} of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property.

40|$|ABSTRACTIn {{the past}} decade {{it has become clear}} that {{asthmatic}} patients who are clinically unresponsive, or “resistant” to <b>glucocorticoid</b> therapy may have T cells which manifest resistance to <b>glucocorticoid</b> inhibition. This is shown by failure of <b>glucocorticoid</b> not only to repress the production of pro-inflammatory, asthma-relevant cytokines such as IL- 5, but also to induce the production of anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL- 10. Molecular mechanisms underlying this resistance are beginning to be defined, and include inappropriate production of transcriptional regulatory proteins (which may bind to and inactivate the <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor), cytokine-induced modifications of the <b>glucocorticoid</b> receptor (such as phosphorylation), which alter its capacity to bind to ligand, and complex interactions which regulate histone acetylation status and the quaternary structure of DNA itself.
