5|$|Robert died at Jumièges, but {{the date}} of his death is unclear.

5|$|The New South Wales waratah was {{a popular}} garden plant at the {{beginning}} of the 20th century.

5|$|The {{introduction}} of infrageneric taxa (such as the subgenus, section and series) in the 19th century by botanists including Augustin Pyrame de Candolle allowed {{the retention of}} large genera that would otherwise have become unwieldy. <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> H. Corner believed that studying large genera might enable greater insights into evolutionary biology, and he concentrated his efforts on large tropical genera such as Ficus.|$|E

5|$|Cantor's {{theory of}} transfinite numbers was {{originally}} regarded as so counter-intuitive – even shocking – that it encountered resistance from mathematical contemporaries such as Leopold Kronecker and Henri Poincaré and later from Hermann Weyl and L. <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Brouwer, while Ludwig Wittgenstein raised philosophical objections. Cantor, a devout Lutheran, believed the theory had been communicated {{to him by}} God. Some Christian theologians (particularly neo-Scholastics) saw Cantor's work {{as a challenge to}} the uniqueness of the absolute infinity in the nature of God – on one occasion equating the theory of transfinite numbers with pantheism – a proposition that Cantor vigorously rejected.|$|E
5|$|In 1890, the Eugene Guard {{became a}} daily newspaper. Charles H. Fisher {{took over the}} paper in 1907 and {{published}} it until 1912 when <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Finneran purchased the paper. Finneran bankrupted the newspaper in 1916, {{partly due to the}} purchase of a perfecting press that proved too expensive for such a small newspaper. The University of Oregon's journalism school briefly ran the paper during the receivership under the guidance of Eric W. Allen.|$|E
5|$|Leading {{up to the}} 2008 NHL Entry Draft, Schenn was a highly-regarded prospect, ranked fifth among draft-eligible North American skaters by the NHL Central Scouting Bureau.

At the Draft, the Toronto Maple Leafs traded with the New York Islanders for a higher draft pick, which they ultimately used to select Schenn.|$|E

5|$|Professor <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Meany was {{selected}} by the society to head the institute following Foote's departure. Meany's assistant principals were John Jeremiah Jacob, Mrs. Meany, and Miss Kern. Jacob was West Virginia's first Democratic governor, who had attended both the institute and its predecessor, Romney Academy. Meany remained principal of the institute until at least 1851. Following his graduation from Dickinson College in 1849, Jacob became the institute's assistant principal under principal Meany. He became the school's principal in 1851 and served in that position until 1853, during which time he taught classes and practiced law.|$|E
5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional epoxidation reactions of olefins.|$|E
5|$|The actual authorship of {{the book}} is unclear. The second Dutch edition {{of the book}} carried the text 'Op last van den staatssekretaris der Z.A.R., F.W.

Smuts is {{indicated}} as author, but probably only edited the introduction {{and the end of the}} book, in co-operation with <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> P. Jorissen. The rest of the text was probably prepared by J. de Villiers Roos.|$|E

5|$|The {{team would}} name Mel Bridgman as their first general manager (GM) in 1991 after being {{turned down by}} Scotty Bowman and John Muckler. The {{decision}} was criticized by the press due to Bridgman's lack of GM experience. In the coaching department, the club would pick Rick Bowness, formerly the Boston Bruins' head coach, as their first head coach, assisted by Alain Vigneault, <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Maguire and Chico Resch. John Ferguson, Sr., would be named director of player personnel.|$|E
5|$|The {{work was}} continued, first by <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Mason from 1946 to 1949, {{and then by}} G. R. Morgan in 1972. Later work led by Edgar Kingsley Tratman {{explored}} the human occupation of the Rhinoceros hole, and showed that the fourth chamber of the great cave was a Romano-British cemetery. During excavations in 1954–1957 at Hole Ground, just outside {{the entrance to the}} cave, the foundations of a 1st-century hut and Iron Age pottery were seen. These were covered by the foundations of Roman buildings, dating from the 1st to the late 4th century.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant director of research <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|<b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Mather {{coached the}} team to three Big Ten titles in his nine seasons as coach. After inheriting Mitchell's team, which he led to a 10–13 overall (3–9, Big Ten) record during the 1919–20 season, he led {{the team to}} an 18–4 overall (8–4, Big Ten) record during the 1920–21 season. This 1921 team won its first eight and last eight games to tie the Wisconsin Badgers and Purdue Boilermakers for the Big Ten title. The team won {{back-to-back}} championships in 1925–26 and 1926–27. The 1926 squad, which was captained by Richard Doyle who became the team's first All-American, tied with Purdue, the Iowa Hawkeyes and Indiana Hoosiers for the conference championship. The 1927 team had a new All-American, Bennie Oosterbaan, and won the school's first back-to-back championships and first outright championship with a 14–3 overall (10–2, Big Ten) record. Mather died after a lengthy battle with cancer in August 1928.|$|E
5|$|Florida State {{received}} the post-score kickoff, then went three-and-out. Virginia Tech recovered the kick at its 35-yard line, {{and began a}} drive that needed only three plays to score a touchdown. The key effort was a 51-yard sprint by running back Darren Evans, which advanced {{the ball to the}} Florida State 9-yard line. The score and extra point pushed Tech's lead to 14–3 with 4:37 remaining. Florida State responded with a quick touchdown drive of its own. From its 32-yard line, the Seminoles needed only six plays, three of them passes from <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Manuel, to reach the end zone. The score with 1:52 remaining trimmed Tech's lead to 14–10 at the 1:52 mark. As the quarter came to an end, Virginia Tech {{received the}} post-score kickoff and advanced the ball to its 22-yard line before the final seconds ticked off the clock and the first quarter ended with Tech leading 14–10.|$|E
5|$|From 1846 to 1849, the {{institute}} was operated {{under the direction}} of Presbyterian Reverend William Henry Foote, who had been a teacher and principal at Romney Academy. In 1849, when the Romney Literary Society established a new operating code for {{the institute}} and a new system of bylaws, Foote took offense and in 1850 founded a rival school, which was known as the Potomac Seminary. Professor <b>E.</b> <b>J.</b> Meany succeeded Foote, followed by John Jeremiah Jacob who served as the school's principal from 1851 to 1853. Jacob later served as West Virginia's first Democratic governor. Reverend Joseph Nelson later served as the school's principal until the American Civil War, and shortly after hostilities ended.|$|E
