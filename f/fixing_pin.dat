40|$|AbstractThe {{bearing in}} the roof of railway station is usually assumed {{three-dimensional}} <b>fixed</b> <b>pin</b> support. Good load-supporting, rotate and back-moving capacities are needed in the bearing design as well as durability. And the most prominent problem is how to bear so huge horizontal load in limited architecture space. Traditional spherical bearing couldn’t sustain huge horizontal loading because of excessive stress concentration induced by point-to-surface contact between upper and base plates. In this paper, a new economical steel hinged bearing form is developed to use surface contact to improve horizontal force carrying capacity. By FEM software ANSYS, nonlinear analyses are performed on bearing models to obtain necessary design results. Comparison between new and traditional bearings shows that new steel bearing is much more reasonable and economic...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background High-throughput cultivations in microtiter {{plates are}} {{the method of}} choice to express {{proteins}} from recombinant clone libraries. Such processes typically include several steps, whereby {{some of them are}} linked by replication steps: transformation, plating, colony picking, preculture, main culture and induction. In this study, the effects of conventional replication methods and replication tools (8 -channel pipette, 96 -pin replicators: steel replicator with <b>fixed</b> or spring-loaded <b>pins,</b> plastic replicator with <b>fixed</b> <b>pins)</b> on growth kinetics of Escherichia coli SCS 1 pQE- 30 pSE 111 were observed. Growth was monitored with the BioLector, an on-line monitoring technique for microtiter plates. Furthermore, the influence of these effects on product formation of Escherichia coli pRhotHi- 2 -EcFbFP was investigated. Finally, a high-throughput cultivation process was simulated with Corynebacterium glutamicum pEKEx 2 -phoD-GFP, beginning at the colony picking step. Results Applying different replication tools and methods for one single strain resulted in high time differences of growth of the slowest and fastest growing culture. The shortest time difference (0. 3 h) was evaluated for the 96 cultures that were transferred with an 8 -channel pipette from a thawed and mixed cryoculture and the longest time difference (6. 9 h) for cultures that were transferred with a steel replicator with <b>fixed</b> <b>pins</b> from a frozen cryoculture. The on-line monitoring of a simulated high-throughput cultivation process revealed strong variances in growth kinetics and a twofold difference in product formation. Another experiment showed that varying growth kinetics, caused by varying initial biomass concentrations (OD 600 of 0. 0125 to 0. 2) led to strongly varying product formation upon induction at a defined point of time. Conclusions To improve the reproducibility of high-throughput cultivation processes and the comparability between different applied cultures, it is strongly recommended to use automated or manual liquid handling stations or, alternatively, multi-channel pipettes. Because of their higher transfer volume and hence precision in comparison to pin replicators, they reduce the variance of initial biomass concentrations. With respect to the results obtained, other methods to increase the comparability between parallel cultivations by compensating differences in biomass concentrations are required, such as using autoinduction media, fed-batch operation of precultures or on-line monitoring in microtiter plates combined with automated liquid handling. </p...|$|R

Improving the {{knowledge}} about the influence factors of the allowable free-span length which required in pipeline design, this study provides information about an evaluation of fatigue life due to vortex induced vibration (VIV). Standard finite element techniques are used to the eigen value analyses of a oil-conveying free-span on seafloor. Combined with VIV response model, the fatigue life under three different end boundary conditions (<b>fixed,</b> <b>pinned</b> and elastic seabed) is evaluated. The influence parameter study {{has shown that the}} allowable span length is very sensitive for structural natural vibration characteristic, controlled by axial force, end conditions and internal flow. The natural frequencies of free span increase while both the internal flow speed and compression decrease, and internal flow velocity was found less important for VIV response than other functional load factors, because the speed in reality is not high enough...|$|R

As Messner writes: A compromise is possible in practice..., not in philosophy. One should always strive for the ideal. But Messner notwithstanding, we probably shouldn't exaggerate the amount of compromise Preuss would have deemed acceptable.|$|R
5000|$|A spin valve is a device, {{consisting}} {{of two or more}} conducting magnetic materials, whose electrical resistance can change between two values depending on the relative alignment of the magnetisation in the layers. The resistance change {{is a result of the}} Giant Magnetoresistive effect. The magnetic layers of the device align [...] "up" [...] or [...] "down" [...] depending on an external magnetic field. In the simplest case, a spin valve consists of a non-magnetic material sandwiched between two ferromagnets, one of which is <b>fixed</b> (<b>pinned)</b> by an antiferromagnet which acts to raise its magnetic coercivity and behaves as a [...] "hard" [...] layer, while the other is free (unpinned) and behaves as a [...] "soft" [...] layer. Due to the difference in coercivity, the soft layer changes polarity at lower applied magnetic field strength than the hard one. Upon application of a magnetic field of appropriate strength, the soft layer switches polarity, producing two distinct states: a parallel, low-resistance state, and an antiparallel, high-resistance state.|$|R

40|$|In recent Canterbury earthquakes, {{structures}} {{have performed}} well {{in terms of}} life safety but the estimated {{total cost of the}} rebuild was as high as $ 40 billion. The major contributors to this cost are repair/demolition/rebuild cost, the resulting downtime and business interruption. For this reason, the authors are exploring alternate building systems that can minimize the downtime and business interruption due to building damage in an earthquake; thereby greatly reducing the financial implications of seismic events. In this paper, a sustainable and demountable precast reinforced concrete (RC) frame system in which the precast members are connected via steel tubes/plates or steel angles/plates and high strength friction grip (HSFG) bolts is introduced. In the proposed system, damaged structural elements in seismic frames can be easily replaced with new ones; thereby making it an easily and quickly repairable and a low-loss system. The column to foundation connection in the proposed system can be designed either as <b>fixed</b> or <b>pinned</b> depending on the requirement of strength and stiffness. In a fixed base frame system, ground storey columns will also be damaged along with beams in seismic events, which are to be replaced after seismic events; whereas in a pin base frame only beams (which are easy to replace) will be damaged. Low to medium rise (3 - 6 storey) precast RC frame buildings with <b>fixed</b> and <b>pin</b> bases are analyzed in this paper; and their lateral capacity, lateral stiffness and natural period are scrutinized to better understand {{the pros and cons of}} the demountable precast frame system with <b>fixed</b> and <b>pin</b> base connections...|$|R
