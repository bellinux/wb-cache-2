5|$|At {{the end of}} the day, man, I'm just tired, and old, and bald, and fat, and grouchy, and bored. You know? So I {{was just}} like, I'm going to make this record, and do this stupid Ozzfest thing, and tell a bunch of stupid jokes in front {{of a lot of people}} at Download, then I'm just going to fuck off for a while. The bigger this gets, the less I care, to the point where I just need to go spend some time with my <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> don't wanna bastardise Strapping and all these other {{projects}} by doing it for the money. Strapping was about the big middle finger, and it still is, but I don't think it needs to go any further than this.|$|E

They're just insulted by me and I completely take that criticism.|$|E
25|$|In 2006, I made {{a serious}} error in {{judgment}} and conducted {{myself in a}} way that was disloyal to my family and to my core beliefs. I recognized my mistake and I told my wife that I had a liaison with another woman, and I asked for her forgiveness. Although I was honest in every painful detail with my <b>family,</b> <b>I</b> did not tell the public. When a supermarket tabloid told a version of the story, I used the fact that the story contained many falsities to deny it. But being 99 percent honest is no longer enough...|$|E

25|$|I {{wanted to}} write about American mythologies, American yearnings that might be responses, delayed or exaggerated but in some way typical, to the {{political}} and social truths of our part of the world in our century. But I wrote very personally about one <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> think {{it takes a long time}} before a crisis—like AIDS—enters the culture to a point where responses exist in a character, where personal gestures are both individual and resonant in a larger way.It was adapted as the 1999 film Anywhere But Here, starring Susan Sarandon and Natalie Portman.

25|$|It is {{time for}} a new beginning. As I have {{discussed}} with some of my friends over the past few weeks, my elected service is one piece of what I hope will be an interesting and diverse professional career. After spending more than 13 of my 31 years in public service, it {{is time for}} a change for me and my <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> was appointed to my first public position as a college freshman and leave my second elected office as a proud father of three little girls. I am stepping down today from the State Assembly to turn greater attention to them and my law practice and to fulfilling other personal and professional aspirations. I will remain an active and vocal voice for better schools, a cleaner environment and lower taxes. I am grateful for the friendship and support of so many, especially my wife Lauren, my family, my campaign volunteers and my clients. It has been a privilege to serve.|$|E
25|$|Speaking {{before the}} opening of the Ordinary Synod of Bishops on the Family in October 2015, McAleese {{ridiculed}} the concept of 300 elderly celibates coming together to discuss family questions. Addressing a meeting of the Global Network of Rainbow (LGBT) Catholics {{on the eve of the}} Vatican’s Synod on the Family, former president McAleese said: “In the days when I was president, we had workshops on various issues and if I wanted to look at an issue, I would consult the experts... But look at the Synod, I have to ask the question: If I wanted expertise on the <b>family,</b> <b>I</b> honestly cannot say that the first thing that would come into my mind would be to call together 300 celibate males who, as far we know, have never raised a child...“Let me repeat a question I asked last year when I saw the Vatican’s lengthy pre-Synod questionnaire, namely how many of these men have ever changed a child’s nappy? For me that is a very important question because it is one thing to say that we all grew up in families, we had mothers, we had fathers but it is a very different thing to raise a gay child, a very different thing to live daily in a relationship and to police the relationships between children and the world.” Acknowledging that the Synod will doubtless be considering the Catholic Church's pastoral approach to homosexuals, McAleese described herself as “cynical” about the outcome of the forthcoming three week consultation.|$|E

500|$|By {{the time}} of Divine's birth in 1945, the Milsteads were {{relatively}} wealthy and socially conservative Baptists. Later describing his upbringing, Divine would recollect: [...] "I {{was an only child}} in, I guess, your upper middle-class American <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> was probably your American spoiled brat." [...] His parents lavished almost anything that he wanted upon him, including food, and he became overweight, a condition he lived with {{for the rest of his}} life. Divine preferred to use his middle name, Glenn, to distinguish himself from his father, and was referred to as such by his parents and friends.|$|E

[...] Mantle has said of his role: It is the job I've enjoyed doing {{more than anything else}} on TV. I have the greatest memories of beautiful, halcyon days-out filming on location and we had such a great, fun crew working on the show. We still get together once a year. Not just the cast but also the directors, producer, props guys, it's like a <b>family!</b> <b>I</b> think the key to part of the series' success was that this great camaraderie came across on screen.|$|E
500|$|In March 2009, she praised President Barack Obama for {{reversing}} {{the ban on}} federally funded embryonic stem cell research. She traveled to Washington, D.C. in June 2009 to unveil a statue of her late husband in the Capitol rotunda. She was also on hand as President Obama signed the Ronald Reagan Centennial Commission Act, and lunched privately with Michelle Obama. Reagan revealed {{in an interview with}} Vanity Fair that Michelle Obama had telephoned her for advice on living and entertaining in the White House. Following the death of Senator Ted Kennedy in August 2009, she said she was [...] "terribly saddened... Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy <b>family...</b> <b>I</b> will miss him." [...] She attended the funeral of Betty Ford in Rancho Mirage, California, on July 12, 2011.|$|E
500|$|As a child, Fonda {{suffered}} from a poor self-image and {{lack of confidence in}} her appearance, an issue exacerbated by her father Henry Fonda. On the subject, Fonda said [...] "I was raised in the ‘50s. I was taught by my father [...] that how I looked was all that mattered, frankly. He was a good man, and I was mad for him, but he sent messages to me that fathers should not send: Unless you look perfect, you're not going to be loved." [...] In adulthood, Fonda developed bulimia which took a toll on her quality of life for many years, an issue that also affected her mother Frances Ford Seymour who committed suicide when Fonda was 12. On the subject of her recovery from bulimia, Fonda said, [...] "It was in my 40s, and if you suffer from bulimia, the older you get, the worse it gets. It takes longer to recover from a bout...I had a career, I was winning awards, I was supporting nonprofits, I had a <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> had to make a choice: I live or I die." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{the general}} {{election}} of 1747, the Prince of Wales again campaigned actively for the opposition but Pelham's party won easily. Like his father before him, the Prince entertained opposition figures at his house in Leicester Square. When the Prince of Wales died suddenly in 1751, his eldest son, Prince George, became heir apparent. The king commiserated with the Dowager Princess of Wales and wept with her. As her son would not reach the age of majority until 1756, a new British Regency Act was passed to make her regent, assisted by a council led by the Duke of Cumberland, in case of George II's death. The king also made a new will, which provided for Cumberland to be sole regent in Hanover. After {{the death of his}} daughter Louisa {{at the end of the}} year, George lamented, [...] "This has been a fatal year for my <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> lost my eldest son– but I am glad of it... Now [...] is gone. I know I did not love my children when they were young: I hated to have them running into my room; but now I love them as well as most fathers." ...|$|E
500|$|President Obama {{said that}} Kennedy's death marked the [...] "passing of an {{extraordinary}} leader" [...] and that he and First Lady Michelle Obama were [...] "heartbroken" [...] to learn of his passing, while Vice President Biden said [...] "today we lost a truly remarkable man," [...] and that Kennedy [...] "changed the circumstances of {{tens of millions of}} Americans". Mitt Romney, former Massachusetts Governor and Kennedy's opponent in the 1994 senate race, called Kennedy [...] "the kind of man you could like even if he was your adversary" [...] and former First Lady Nancy Reagan said she was [...] "terribly saddened". [...] She went on, [...] "Given our political differences, people are sometimes surprised how close Ronnie and I have been to the Kennedy <b>family....</b> <b>I</b> will miss him." [...] Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia, the President pro tempore of the Senate, issued a statement on Kennedy's death in which he said [...] "My heart and soul weeps at the loss of my best friend in the Senate, my beloved friend, Ted Kennedy." [...] (Byrd had broken down on the Senate floor and cried uncontrollably when Kennedy's cancer diagnosis was made public the previous year.) Upon his death, his sister Jean is the only one still living of the nine Kennedy siblings.|$|E
500|$|After {{three years}} with Celtic, in July 2004, Nécib was {{selected}} to attend the CNFE academy at Clairefontaine. She initially struggled to adapt at the center admitting [...] "the first year was really hard because I was so far from my <b>family.</b> <b>I</b> almost gave up". However, after developing a rapport with future international teammates Sarah Bouhaddi, Élodie Thomis, Laure Boulleau, Jessica Houara, and the aforementioned Pizzala, Nécib quickly returned to the form that got her selected to the center. The CNFE academy is allowed participation in the French women's football league system and, from 2002–2007, fielded a team that participated in the Division 1 Féminine. Nécib spent two seasons with the team and made her league debut on 29 August 2004 against Lyon. In the match, she scored the only goal, a 90th-minute winner, in a 1–0 win. Nécib finished the campaign with 20 league appearances and six goals. Four of her six goals came {{in the final four}} weeks of the season. On 26 March 2005, she scored a double in a 4–2 defeat to Juvisy. A week later, she scored the only goal in a win over Olympique Saint-Memmie and, on the final match day of the season, she scored the team's fourth goal in a 5–1 win over Lyon. CNFE ultimately finished the campaign in 5th-place position. In the following season, Nécib appeared in 18 matches and scored three goals, all of which came in victories.|$|E
