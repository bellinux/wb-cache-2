40|$|My thesis {{project is}} a {{creative}} fiction novella titled Dealing with Daemons with a critical introduction discussing {{the history of the}} genre, the history of the vampire, current criticisms of the genre, and specific relations between the genre and my academic interests in English and Philosophy. In its broadest sense, the genre my narrative falls under is young adult (YA) fantasy. More specifically, it is a teen paranormal romance. As the title suggests, my novella will feature more paranormal activity than that of vampires; it will also include angels and daemons. The hero and heroine are vampires, but their predicament deals with daemons and dominions (angels). Of the angels and daemons, one might be considered a main character?Athan Levi (Leviathan), a prince of hell and its gatekeeper. Danica is the heroine and first person narrator. She is what is known as a damphyr?half vampire and half human. Dimitri is a full vampire and Danica?s love interest. Dimitri and Danica have a debt to pay Athan for protecting Danica from the dominions the day she was born. Their mission is to retrieve escaped supernatural souls that have returned to earth through the vestibules of liminal creatures such as ravens, foxes, and cats. The targeted audience is (mainly female) young adults, but my hope is <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>readership</b> including adults who enjoy fantasy fiction as well.

40|$|Abstract: Communicative competences {{and the use}} of a {{semiochemical}} vocabulary enable {{bacteria to}} develop, organise and coordinate rich social life with a great variety of behavioral patterns even in which they organise themselves like mul-ticellular organisms. They have existed for almost four billion years and still survive, being part of the most dramatic changes in evolutionary history such as DNA invention, cellular life, invention of nearly all protein types, partial constitu-tion of eukaryotic cells, vertical colonisation of all eukaryotes, high adaptability through horizontal gene transfer and co-operative multispecies colonisation of all ecological niches. Recent research demonstrates that these bacterial compe-tences derive from the aptitude of viruses for natural genome editing. In contrast to a book which would be the appropriate space to outline in depth all communicative pathways inherent in bacterial life in this current article I want to give an overview <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>readership</b> over the great variety of bacterial bio-communication: In a first step I describe how they interpret and coordinate, what semiochemical vocabulary they share and which goals they try to reach.

In a third stage I will focus on intraorganismic communication, i. e. the re-lationship between bacteria and their obligate settlers, i. e. viruses.

40|$|I {{appreciated}} the chance during my sabbatical to write more articles <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>readership.</b> I had three pieces run in The New Yorker online about {{ways that we}} reconsider Shakespeare today. One, “American Playwrights Try to Reinvent the History Play,” looked at a series of commissions from the Oregon Shakespeare Festival that adapt the model of Shakespeare’s history plays to represent change in American history; a second, “Two Ways to Bring Shakespeare into the Twenty-First Century,” reviewed contrasting experimental Shakespeare productions that I saw in the U. K.; and a third, “The Radical Argument of the New Oxford Shakespeare,” evaluated the claim of a controversial new edition of the complete works that credits many other Renaissance playwrights as Shakespeare’s collaborators. I brought my scholarly interests to bear on popular culture, too, in a piece for Slate about Shakespeare’s legacy in the American West as reflected in a new HBO show (“Westworld Is Full of Shakespeare Quotations, but It’s Using Them All Wrong”), and two articles editorially solicited for the online academic review Public Books: one about reading the scripts of two popular shows (“ 2 ̆ 7 Harry Potter 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 Hamilton 2 ̆ 7 from the Page to the Stage”) and another about the gender politics of Disney musicals (“Lin-Manuel Meets Moana”). Most unexpectedly, I made an appearance on The New York Times opinion page when I learned that President Trump’s chief strategist had written an adaptation of Shakespeare’s Coriolanus that offered surprising insight into his vision of social change (“Behold, Steve Bannon’s Hip-Hop Shakespeare Rewrite: Coriolanus”).

40|$|A major reappraisal of the {{taxonomy}} of ungulates (hoofed mammals) {{was presented in}} 2011 (Groves and Grubb 2011; G&G henceforth). The reappraisal presents a drastic revision of the taxonomic diversity of the group. It nearly doubles the number of bovid species—a group comprising cattle, bison, buffalo, goats, sheep, and antelopes—currently recognized (IUCN 2012), raising {{the number of species}} from 143 to 279. In our opinion, this represents taxonomic inflation; ecotypes or subspecies have been raised to the level of full species based not on new data, but solely on a change in the species concept used (Isaac et al. 2004). As we argue below, the excessive splitting of species is unconvincing in many cases. Furthermore, we warn that such taxonomic inflation in the bovids may impede management and conservation efforts (Isaac et al. 2004; Mace 2004; Frankham et al. 2012). The revised bovid species list of G&G was incorporated into the recently published “Handbook of the Mammals of the World—Volume 2 ” (Wilson and Mittermeier 2011; HMW henceforth) published in collaboration with the IUCN and Conservation International, 2 of the leading international authorities involved in the conservation of global biodiversity. Whereas G&G is a scientific revision intended for experts in the field, HMW is a multiauthored book series presenting the most up-to-date taxonomy of mammals <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>broader</b> <b>readership.</b> Collectively, these two volumes are likely to be highly influential and serve as a guideline for a wide-ranging audience including taxonomists, conservationists, ecologists, biodiversity managers, and policy makers. Any taxonomic revision that doubles the number of species within a family must anticipate critical evaluation, not least when it occurs in a prominent group such as the bovids. Here, we discuss the revision and its potential consequences, which we believe may be detrimental in many respects. The critiques we are raising are two-fold. First, we call into question the scientific grounds for the species splitting in G&G. Second, we criticize HMW for singularly adopting the bovid species list of G&G without subjecting it to critical evaluation. We discuss some of the practical downstream consequences of these actions.

The high-level research found here clearly shows the great impact that Calvin has had on both church and society. It is a great pleasure to see Calvin here anew. Eberhard Busch / University of Gttingen / That John Calvin made a deep and lasting impact on many aspects of history is common knowledge but the character of the man and the nature of his influence are perhaps as controversial as any that can be named. It is thus a challenge to examine even a fraction of the many ways that Calvins life and thought have contributed to the shaping of later ages in both church and society. This volume offers essays on key points from an appropriately international group of authors appreciative but critical, drawing on a rich range of recent scholarship, presented in a pleasing and accessible form. It is a fine place for the new reader of Calvin {{to get a glimpse of}} his impact, while offering a fresh summary of some significant issues for more advanced students of the Reformer.

40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} is a beautiful, {{strange and}} successful theory that {{originated in the}} 1920 s. The theory, which Niels Bohr regarded as finished and complete, has {{in the last few}} decades rapidly developed in unexpected directions.

40|$|Data mining {{applications}} {{range from}} commercial to social domains, with novel applications appearing swiftly; for example, {{within the context}} of social networks. The expanding application sphere and social reach of advanced data mining raise pertinent issues of privacy and security. Present-day data mining is a progressive multidisciplinary endeavor. This inter- and multidisciplinary approach is well reflected within the field of information systems. The information systems research addresses software and hardware requirements for supporting computationally and data-intensive applications. Furthermore, it encompasses analyzing system and data aspects, and all manual or automated activities.
