5|$|In Ex parte Tom Tong (1883), the Court held that—under 1872 {{amendments}} to the certification procedure, which went into effect during the Chase Court era—because habeas corpus was a civil proceeding, questions arising in habeas cases could not be certified to the Supreme Court until a <b>final</b> <b>judgment</b> had been entered. In Ex parte Milligan (1866), after the repeal of those amendments, the Court held that habeas petitions in the circuit courts could {{be a source of}} certified questions to the Supreme Court.|$|E

5|$|The key {{themes of}} the early Quranic verses {{included}} the responsibility of man towards his creator; {{the resurrection of the}} dead, God's <b>final</b> <b>judgment</b> followed by vivid descriptions of the tortures in Hell and pleasures in Paradise, and the signs of God in all aspects of life.

However, the <b>final</b> <b>judgment</b> had not yet come, so the Drapier also included arguments claiming that Wood's halfpence would destroy the Irish economy and {{the souls of the}} citizenry.|$|E

25|$|Christianity holds several {{different}} views on Christ's role in defeating Satan.
