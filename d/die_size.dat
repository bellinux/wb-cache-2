25|$|Model 30 {{stepping}} A1 (cpuid 106d1h) adds an L3 cache {{as well as}} six {{instead of}} the usual two cores, which leads to an unusually large <b>die</b> <b>size</b> of 503mm². As of February 2008, it has only found its way into the very high-end Xeon 7400 series (Dunnington).|$|E
25|$|Higher {{demagnification}} {{will increase}} the mask size or {{reduce the size of}} the printed field. Reduced field size would divide full-size chip patterns (normally taking up 26mm × 33mm) among two or more conventional 6-inch EUV masks. Large (approaching or exceeding 500mm2) chips, typically used for GPUs or servers, would have to be stitched together from two or more sub-patterns from different masks. Without field stitching, <b>die</b> <b>size</b> would be limited. With field stitching, features that cross field boundaries would have alignment errors, and the extra time required to change masks would reduce the throughput of the EUV system.|$|E
25|$|The Athlon's CPU cache {{consisted}} of the typical two levels. Athlon was the first x86 processor with a 128kB split level 1 cache; a 2-way associative cache separated into 2×64kB for data and instructions (a concept from Harvard architecture). This cache was double the size of K6's already large 2×32kB cache, and quadruple the size of Pentium II and III's 2×16kB L1 cache. The initial Athlon (Slot A, later called Athlon Classic) used 512kB of level 2 cache separate from the CPU, on the processor cartridge board, running at 50% to 33% of core speed. This was done because the 250nm manufacturing process was too large to allow for on-die cache while maintaining cost-effective <b>die</b> <b>size.</b> Later Athlon CPUs, afforded greater transistor budgets by smaller 180nm and 130nm process nodes, moved to on-die L2 cache at full CPU clock speed.|$|E

25|$|The SIMD vector {{processor}} (VMX128) was modified for the Xbox {{to include a}} dot-product instruction. The dot-product instruction took far less latency than discrete instructions. The VMX128 was also modified {{by the addition of}} direct 3D (D3D) compressed data format. This led to an approximate 50 percent savings in required band-width and memory footprint making the CPU having a theoretical peak performance of 115.2GFLOPS, being capable of 9.6 billion dot products per second. Each core of the CPU was capable of simultaneous multithreading and was clocked at 3.2GHz. However, to reduce CPU <b>die</b> <b>size,</b> complexity, cost, and power demands, the processor used in-order execution in contrast to the Intel Coppermine 128-based Pentium III used in the original Xbox, which used more complex out of order execution. The original chip used a 90nm process, although a newer 65nm process SOI revision was implemented on later models, which was in-turn superseded by a 45nm combined CPU and GPU chip. A 21.6GB/s front side bus, aggregated 10.8GB/s upstream and downstream, connected Xenon with the graphics processor/northbridge. Xenon was equipped with an 8th way set associative 1MB Level 2 cache on-die running at half CPU clock speed. This cache was shared amongst the three CPU cores. Each core had separate L1 caches, each containing a two-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 instruction cache and a four-way set associative 32-Kbyte L1 data cache. The write-through data cache did not allocate cache lines on writes. The CPU also contained ROM storing Microsoft private encrypted keys, used to decrypt game data. The heat sink implemented to cool the Xenon CPU was composed of aluminum fins with a copper base, and a heat pipe. Newer revisions, which had a smaller core, do not feature the heat pipe or copper base. The heat sink was cooled by two 70mm fans {{at the rear of the}} console on original-style consoles, while a single fan mounted on the side of the consoles was used in Xbox 360 S consoles. There were several types of fan used in Xbox 360s, which were produced by Nidec, Sunon and Delta Electronics.|$|E

50|$|Although {{the whole}} {{workpiece}} may be {{inserted into the}} <b>die,</b> the <b>sizing</b> operation can give dimensional accuracy to {{a portion of the}} part based on the contact with the <b>die.</b> <b>Sizing</b> is mostly used to give a forged or cast part better dimensional accuracy. Mated surfaces between touching parts like gears are often sized. The sizing operation also provides a better surface hardness and finish to the workpiece. Also, the sized surface of the workpiece gets denser and stronger when the operation is performed. The dimensional tolerance of the operation is about 0.025 mm. Primary pressing or a compacting die are typically used when sizing small batches of compact. To keep costs down, larger batches of compact usually have a specialized die made specifically for the operation.|$|R
