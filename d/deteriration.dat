40|$|The paper first {{presents}} the results of numerical analysis for the convergence-divergence phenomena of the centroidal strain and the deterioration of the carrying capacity of steel beam-column with square hollow section, which have the degrading stress-strain relation representing the effect of local bucking. Then, it formulates the convergence condition of the centroidal strain of a beam-column subjected to repeated uniaxial or biaxial bending, {{presents the}} expression for the accumulation of the centroidal strain and the <b>deteriration</b> of the bending moment carrying capacity. Finally, the paper proposes an evaluation method of the seismic resistance capacity, and discusses the interaction formula for the limiting values of the width-thickness ratio of plate elements and the axial force...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we develop and analyse an {{inventory}} model for deteriorating items with Weibull {{rate of decay}} having finite rate of replenishment and selling price dependent demand. Using the differential equations, the instantaneous state of inventory at time ‘t’, the amount of <b>deteriration</b> etc. are derived. With suitable cost considerations the total cost function and profit rate function are also obtained by maximizing the profit rate function, the optimal ordering and pricing policies of the model are derived. The sensitivity of the model {{with respect to the}} parameters is discussed through numerical illustration. It is observed that the deteriorating parameters have a tremendous influence on the optimal selling price and ordering quantity. Keywords: Perishability, Instantaneous rate of deterioration, Total cost function, Profit rate function, the optimal ordering and pricing policies. </div...|$|E
40|$|Terms used {{to discuss}} the {{cultural}} landscape, land use issues, and rural visual elements are used to explore changes in eighteen sections of Randolph County, Indiana. Documented trends {{of change in the}} visual elementL, and related issues during the forty year period include field enlargement, the removal or <b>deteriration</b> of fences, and loss of tree lines. Some wooded areas were cleared but most showed regrowth after pasturing ceased. Changing agricultural practices and financial pressures under lie many land use choices. Other changes include increasing farm sizes, parcellation, and the deterioration or removal of settlement structures. (55) As changes proceed, old elements, often those providing variety and cultural linkage with the past are giving way; landscapes are becoming more open and uniform. At the same time new elements such as power lines and subdivisions are creating a new rural look. Department of Landscape ArchitectureThesis (M. L. A. ...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the possible role of reactive oxygen species in the pathogenesis of heart failure in broilers. The experiment was conducted with 160, 1 day old male broilers (Ross 308) to investigate to clarify the mechanism of cell injury causing the pathogenesis of PHS syndrome. The chickens were divided in 2 groups of 4 replicates and 20 chicks for any replicate. One group of these chickens was raised in Normal Temperature (NT) treatment and the other group was raised in Cold Temperature (CT) treatment for induce pulmonary hypertension syndrome. Mortality was inspected to determine cause of death and diagnose of heart failure. Hematological, biochemical and pathological tests {{were used to determine}} the incidence of PHS including total Red Blood Cell (RBC), Hemoglobin (HGB), Hematocrit (HCT), release of Alanine Transaminase (ALT), Aspartate Transaminase (AST), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) and a best indicator of lipid oxidation subsequent to generated oxidative stress was Malondialdehyde (MDA). Sampling of blood and liver tissue were determined at day 21 and 42. At end of the experiment (week 6), 2 chicks from each replicate were randomly selected and slaughtered. The heart was removed; the right ventricle was dissected away from the left ventricle and septum then ratio of Right Ventricle weight to Total Ventricle weight (RV/TV) calculated too. The results of the experiment indicated that {{there was a significant difference}} in RBC, HBG at 21 and HGB, RBC, HCT at 42 between groups as CT group had a greater (p< 0. 05) HGB, RBC at 21 and HBG, RBC, HCT at 42. However, there was no significant difference in ALT, AST and LDH plasma levels between groups at day 21, CT group had greater (p< 0. 05) levels in AST, ALT and LDH at day 42. The levels malondialdehyde equivalents an indicator of lipid oxidation sub-sequent to generated oxidative stress at plasma and liver tissue was significantly higher (p< 0. 05) in CT group at day 21 and 42. RV/TV ratio and mortality due to ascites, also were significantly affected by treatments as CT group had greater (p< 0. 05) RV/TV and mortality due to ascites mortality percentage compared to NT group. In conclusion, the results indicated that the <b>deteriration</b> of heart function in modern fast growing broilers in the experimental model is associated with oxidative stress leading to lipid peroxidation and reactive oxygen species may be involved in the pathogenesis of the pulmonary hypertension syndrome in broilers chickens...|$|E
