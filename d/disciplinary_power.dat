2500|$|... 3. Ecclesiastical {{disciplinary}} law concerning ecclesiastical {{power of}} discipline {{and the establishment of}} The Royal Court of Justice for Ecclesiastical Affairs. This subordinated the Catholic Church to state jurisdiction not only in external but also in internal matters. The law regulated the exercise of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> by church authorities against their officers for special violation of their duties. Members of the court had to be Germans residing in Germany. Bodily chastisement by the Church was entirely forbidden, fines were limited to maximum amounts, restrictions of freedom could only consist in banishment to a church institution within Germany no longer that 3 months and not against the will of the person concerned. On the other hand, the new court also was given jurisdiction over ecclesiastical officers in violation of state laws.|$|E
2500|$|On 13 November 1918, Gyula Károlyi's new {{minister}} of defense, Albert Bartha, {{decided to take}} on the Budapest Soldiers' Soviet head on in an attempt to bolster the sagging discipline of the army. Bartha declared that he would [...] "no longer tolerate Soldiers' Councils," [...] a position which greatly agitated the newly empowered soldiers. On 4 December he was forced to retreat from this position, however, when the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> of the officers was transferred to new popularly elected military tribunals. Bartha attempted to dodge this decision with the establishment of new disciplinary [...] "flying squads," [...] but this move was regarded as counterrevolutionary and Bartha was forced to resign on 11 December. Before this resignation was publicized, Pogány, acting without the endorsement of the Social Democratic Party, led a soldiers' demonstration on the Ministry of Defense demanding Bartha's dismissal. The formal announcement of the resignation on 12 December made it appear to have been the direct result of the street action, further bolstering the status of the Budapest Soldiers' Soviet {{at the expense of the}} authority of the officers corps.|$|E

5000|$|Cartographic mapping has {{historically}} been a key strategy of governmentality. Harley, drawing on Foucault, affirms that State-produced maps [...] "extend and reinforce the legal statutes, territorial imperatives, and values stemming from the exercise of political power". Typically, State-led mapping conforms to Bentham's concept of a panopticon, in which 'the one views the many'. From a Foucauldian vantage point, this was the blueprint for <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Normalization {{refers to}} social {{processes}} through which ideas and actions {{come to be}} seen as 'normal' and become taken-for-granted or 'natural' in everyday life. In sociological theory, normalization appears in two forms.First, the concept of normalization is found in the work of Michel Foucault, especially Discipline and Punish, in the context of his account of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power.</b> As Foucault used the term, normalization involved the construction of an idealized norm of conduct [...] - [...] for example, the way a proper soldier ideally should stand, march, present arms, and so on, as defined in minute detail [...] - [...] and then rewarding or punishing individuals for conforming to or deviating from this ideal. In Foucault's account, normalization was one of an ensemble of tactics for exerting the maximum social control with the minimum expenditure of force, which Foucault calls [...] "disciplinary power". <b>Disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> emerged {{over the course of the}} 19th century, came to be used extensively in military barracks, hospitals, asylums, schools, factories, offices, and so on, and hence became a crucial aspect of social structure in modern societies.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} 21st century, {{scholars}} began to pay increasing attention to various topics in {{the rhetoric of}} health and medicine. J. Blake Scott’s 2003 book Risky Rhetoric: AIDS and the Cultural Practices of HIV Testing used Michel Foucault's theory of examination, which defines rhetoric {{as a form of}} <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power,</b> to examine the cultural condition that influence HIV testing. He reported that the rhetoric used in public policy and various propaganda led to the stigmatization and discrimination of people with HIV/AIDS.|$|E
5000|$|In 1821 a new {{principal}} keeper, Elam Lynds, {{was appointed}} to run the prison.

The committee of Auburn and other staff members of the Auburn Theological Seminary petitioned to bring {{the issue of the}} punishments to the State government. “The law stated that six blows on the naked back with the 'cat' or six-stranded whip was the most punishment that could be assigned for any one offense.” ...|$|E
50|$|Mbembe {{claims that}} Michel Foucault’s concept of biopower - as an {{assemblage}} of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> and biopolitics - is no longer sufficient to explain these contemporary forms of subjugation. To the insights of Foucault regarding the notions of sovereign power and biopower, Mbembe adds the concept of necropower, which goes beyond merely “inscribing bodies within disciplinary apparatuses”. Discussing the examples of Palestine, Africa, and Kosovo, Mbembe shows how the power of sovereignty now becomes enacted {{through the creation of}} zones of death where death becomes the ultimate exercise of domination and the primary form of resistance.|$|E

5000|$|However, the Congress also passed two resolutions {{that went}} against the {{interests}} of the SPD leadership. First, it called on the [...] "Council of the People's Deputies" [...] to begin immediately with the socialisation of all [...] "suitable" [...] industries, especially mining. Secondly, it approved the so-called Hamburger Punkte that called for the election of officers, for <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> to lie with the soldiers' councils, no insignia of rank and no rank off-duty. However, these demands were anathema to the leadership of the military, in particular those relating to the position of the soldiers' councils vis-à-vis the regular officer corps.|$|E

50|$|Vessels of {{this class}} {{do not have}} an {{executive}} officer (Erster Offizier). Traditionally, in the Germany Navy this was used as a rule to classify a vessel as a boat, not a ship. In a press release the German Navy states that these corvettes will be called ships nonetheless because of their size, armament and endurance.The commanding officer wields the same <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> as a German Army company commander, not that of a battalion commander {{as is the case with}} the larger German warships such as frigates. However, in size, armament, protection and role these corvettes resemble modern anti-surface warfare (ASuW) frigates, the main difference being the total absence of any anti-submarine warfare (ASW) related sensors or weapons.|$|E

50|$|Accordingly, {{criticism}} in the Voice spanned a broad range. Workers denounced the new ethic of accumulation itself, seeing it as both immoral and destructive of the benevolent parts of human nature. They expressed alarm at how the profit motive directed technological change, as new ‘labor-saving’ machinery {{that might have been}} used to reduce toil was instead deployed to increase output. They protested the new ways of organizing work, which, in the name of maximizing profit, was divided into confined, repetitive tasks that diminished their capacity for self-development. They were dismayed by how economic power infected the political system, resulting in dubious and expensive wars, and making labor reform efforts difficult. And all of this, of course, in addition the harsh <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> wielded by the corporations directly, which worsened their position amidst unprecedented corporate prosperity.|$|E

50|$|Luke {{argues that}} {{heightened}} awareness of social vulnerability to environmental factors {{coupled with the}} increased importance of macro-economic competition (rather than Cold-War military confrontation) in geo-political power struggles led {{to the rise of}} sustainable development as the synthesis of these two interrelated concerns. The <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> of governmentality is refigured as “enviro-discipline”, a broader concept that “expresses the authority of eco-knowledgeable, geo-powered forces to police the fitness of all biological organisms and the health of their natural environments” (146). This constitutes an important expansion of the object of governmental rule and the area to be managed. Foucault’s focus on “population” now includes “all of life’s biodiversity” (Luke, 122) and, given the interconnected nature of environmental systems, states must now seek to extend their control far outside of their territorial boundaries to ensure the security and productivity of their population (Luke 134).|$|E
