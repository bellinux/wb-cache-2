5|$|After the indecisive {{results of}} the Battle of Cuito Cuanavale, Fidel Castro claimed that the {{increased}} cost of continuing to fight for South Africa had placed Cuba <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> aggressive combat position of the war, arguing that he was preparing to leave Angola with his opponents on the defensive. According to Cuba, the political, economical and technical cost to South Africa of maintaining its presence in Angola proved too much. Conversely, the South Africans believe that they indicated their resolve to the superpowers by preparing a nuclear test that ultimately forced the Cubans into a settlement.|$|E

5|$|Silver fulminate, AgCNO, a powerful, touch-sensitive {{explosive}} used in percussion caps, {{is made by}} {{reaction of}} silver metal with nitric acid {{in the presence of}} ethanol. Other dangerously explosive silver compounds are silver azide, AgN3, formed by reaction of silver nitrate with sodium azide, and silver acetylide, Ag2C2, formed when silver reacts with acetylene gas in ammonia solution. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> characteristic reaction, silver azide decomposes explosively, releasing nitrogen gas: given the photosensitivity of silver salts, this behaviour may be induced by shining a light on its crystals.|$|E

5|$|After the UFA entered electoral {{politics}} {{and won the}} 1921 election, new premier Herbert Greenfield asked Brownlee to serve as his attorney-general. Brownlee agreed and {{was elected to the}} Legislative Assembly of Alberta in a by-election in the riding of Ponoka. As attorney-general, he was an important member of Greenfield's government. He was closely involved <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> important activities, including efforts to better the lot of farmers living in Alberta's drought-ridden south, divest itself of money-losing railways, and win jurisdiction over natural resources from the federal government. When a group of UFA backbenchers grew frustrated with Greenfield's weak leadership, they asked Brownlee to replace him. Brownlee eventually agreed, and became premier in 1925.|$|E
5|$|In 1942, <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> {{significant}} schism, {{at least}} 250 members left the Church. Tensions {{began to build}} after Joaquín's birthday, when the congregation gave him gifts of flowers and sang hymns celebrating his birthday. This celebration generated a heated debate that culminated with the defection of several church members, including some pastors. Anthropologist Renée de la Torre described this schism as a power struggle in which Joaquín was accused of having enriched himself {{at the expense of}} the faithful. Church dissidents took to El Occidental to accuse members of La Luz del Mundo of committing immoralities with young women. Some of the accusations were aimed to close down a temple that LLDM used with government permission. Members of La Luz del Mundo attribute this episode to the envy and ambition of the dissidents, who formed their own group called El Buen Pastor (The Good Shepherd) under the leadership of José María González, with doctrines and practices similar to those of La Luz del Mundo. The leader is considered a prophet of God. As of 2010, El Buen Pastor Church has a membership of 17,700 in Mexico.|$|E

Quatermass concludes that <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> primitive phase mankind was visited by this race of Martians. Some apes and primitive pre-humans were taken away and genetically altered to give them abilities such as telepathy, telekinesis and other psychic powers. They were then returned to Earth, and the buried artefact {{is one of the}} ships that had crashed {{at the end of its}} journey. With their home world dying, the aliens had tried to change humanity's ancestors to have minds and abilities similar to their own, but with a bodily form adapted to life on Earth.|$|E
5|$|The Scuppernong had {{remained}} largely undeveloped throughout history. In 1793, {{the town of}} Columbia was built on its banks, as were several boat landings. The Scuppernong is a blackwater river: it water is colored like black tea or coffee. The Scuppernong served {{as a means of}} transportation for the early settlers in this region of North Carolina. Since 1989 the Nature Conservancy has sought to protect it <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> natural state. In 2002 the Nature Conservancy offered to donate four tracts of land that they owned along the Scuppernong if the state would purchase three more tracts that became available that same year. The state agreed and in 2004 the area along the river was officially added to the state park system.|$|E
5|$|The bookwheel, <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> {{commonly}} seen form, {{was invented}} by Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli in 1588, presented {{as one of the}} 195 designs in Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino Ramelli (The various and ingenious machines of Captain Agostino Ramelli). To ensure that the books remained at a constant angle, Ramelli incorporated an epicyclic gearing arrangement, a complex device that had only previously been used in astronomical clocks. Ramelli's design is unnecessarily elaborate, as he likely understood that gravity could have worked just as effectively (as it does with a Ferris wheel, invented centuries later), but the gearing system allowed him to display his mathematical prowess. While other people would go on to build bookwheels based on Ramelli's design, Ramelli did not in fact ever construct his own.|$|E

5|$|With {{the advent}} of printing, poets gained greater control over the mass-produced visual presentations of their work. Visual {{elements}} have become {{an important part of}} the poet's toolbox, and many poets have sought to use visual presentation for a wide range of purposes. Some Modernist poets have made the placement of individual lines or groups of lines on the page an integral part of the poem's composition. At times, this complements the poem's rhythm through visual caesuras of various lengths, or creates juxtapositions so as to accentuate meaning, ambiguity or irony, or simply to create an aesthetically pleasing form. <b>In</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> extreme form, this can lead to concrete poetry or asemic writing.|$|E
5|$|At ambient conditions, {{americium}} {{is present}} <b>in</b> <b>its</b> <b>most</b> stable α form {{which has a}} hexagonal crystal symmetry, and a space group P63/mmc with lattice parameters a= 346.8pm and c= 1124pm, and four atoms per unit cell. The crystal consists of a double-hexagonal close packing with the layer sequence ABAC and so is isotypic with α-lanthanum and several actinides such as α-curium. The crystal structure of americium changes with pressure and temperature. When compressed at room temperature to 5 GPa, α-Am transforms to the β modification, which has a face-centered cubic (fcc) symmetry, space group Fmm and lattice constant a= 489pm. This fcc structure {{is equivalent to the}} closest packing with the sequence ABC. Upon further compression to 23 GPa, americium transforms to an orthorhombic γ-Am structure similar to that of α-uranium. There are no further transitions observed up to 52 GPa, except for an appearance of a monoclinic phase at pressures between 10 and 15 GPa. There is no consistency on the status of this phase in the literature, which also sometimes lists the α, β and γ phases as I, II and III. The β-γ transition is accompanied by a 6% decrease in the crystal volume; although theory also predicts a significant volume change for the α-β transition, it is not observed experimentally. The pressure of the α-β transition decreases with increasing temperature, and when α-americium is heated at ambient pressure, at 770°C it changes into an fcc phase which is different from β-Am, and at 1075°C it converts to a body-centered cubic structure. The pressure-temperature phase diagram of americium is thus rather similar to those of lanthanum, praseodymium and neodymium.|$|E
