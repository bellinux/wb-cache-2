40|$|Learning in {{educational}} games is {{often associated with}} some form of competition. We investigated how students responded to winning or losing in an educational math game, with respect to playing with or without a Teachable Agent (TA). Students could choose between game modes in which the <b>TA</b> <b>took</b> a more passive or active role, or let the TA play a game entirely on its own. Based on the data logs from 3983 games played by 163 students (age 10 – 11), we analyzed data on students’ persistence, challenge-seeking and performance during gameplay. Results indicated that students showed greater persistence when playing together with the TA, by more often repeating a lost game with the TA, than a lost game after playing alone. Students’ challenge-seeking, by increasing the difficulty level, was greater following a win than following a loss, especially after the TA won on its own. Students’ gameplay performance was unaffected by their TA winning or losing but was, unexpectedly, slightly worse following a win by the student alone. We conclude that engaging a TA can make students respond more productively to both winning and losing, depending on the particular role the <b>TA</b> <b>takes</b> in the game. These results may inform more specific hypotheses as to the differential effects of competing and collaborating in novel, AI-supported social constellations, such as with TAs, on students’ motivation and ego-involvement {{in educational}} games...|$|R

40|$|To better {{predict how}} ocean {{acidification}} will affect coral reefs, {{it is important}} to understand how biogeochemical cycles on reefs alter carbonate chemistry over various temporal and spatial scales. This study quantifies the contribution of fresh groundwater discharge (as traced by radon) and shallow porewater exchange (as quantified from advective chamber incubations) to total alkalinity (TA) dynamics on a fringing coral reef lagoon along the southern Pacific island of Rarotonga over a tidal and diel cycle. Benthic alkalinity fluxes were affected by the advective circulation of water through permeable sediments, with net daily flux rates of carbonate alkalinity ranging from − 1. 55 to 7. 76 mmol m− 2 d− 1 , depending on the advection rate. Submarine groundwater discharge (SGD) was a source of TA to the lagoon, with the highest flux rates measured at low tide, and an average daily TA flux of 1080 mmol m− 2 d− 1 . Both sources of TA were important on a reef wide basis, although SGD acted solely as a delivery mechanism of TA to the lagoon, while porewater advection was either a sink or source of TA dependant on the time of day. On a daily basis, groundwater can contribute approximately 70 % to 80 % of the <b>TA</b> <b>taken</b> up by corals within the lagoon. This study describes overlooked sources of TA to coral reef ecosystems that can potentially alter water-column carbonate chemistry. We suggest that porewater and groundwater fluxes of <b>TA</b> should be <b>taken</b> into account in ocean acidification models in order to properly address changing carbonate chemistry within coral reef ecosystems...|$|R

40|$|This paper empirically assesses how science, technology, and {{innovation}} (STI) {{policies in the}} regions of Flanders and Wallonia (Belgium) are affected by, and possibly transformed through, technology assessment (TA). Broadly defined, TA encompasses activities and programs that seek to expand and deepen the knowledge base of contemporary knowledge-based economies (KBEs), typically by including new actors (e. g. trade unions), ideas (e. g. science in society), and rationales (e. g. participatory techniques) in STI processes. The paper thus seeks to render concrete how TA ideas and programs unfold with, and potentially steer, new articulations of knowledge, which are imperative to present-day STI processes. Drawing on TA case studies in the two regions, the paper illustrates how <b>TA</b> <b>takes</b> on various shapes and forms, including that of mediating instrument, policy-oriented decision-making tool linked to Parliament, and experimental-deliberative mechanism. It is argued that while these TA forms engender new kinds of knowledge and knowledge production, {{the extent to which}} TA discourses and practices are effectively taken up in STI is contingent upon how TA taps into, and aligns itself with, global and regional dynamics. The former comprise the convergence of technology research {{and innovation}} around the KBE and the advent of strategic science, with its emphasis on real-world problem solving (relevance) and basic research (excellence); the latter entail constitutional reforms that spurred the regionalization of STI policy in Belgium. Our analysis brings a macro-sociological and political sensitivity to bear on TA. Rather than conceiving of TA as a mere management tool or governance technique, we suggest that TA processes enact, as well as counteract, dominant innovation policies. How TA positions itself or is positioned in relation to these policies, is particularly relevant to consider in view of the Flemish Government’s recent decision to abolish its parliamentary TA institute and the Walloon Government’s intention of erecting one...|$|R

40|$|A mixed methods {{research}} {{investigation was}} carried out to evaluate the development of verbal skills in young {{children with special needs}} receiving music therapy from a qualified therapist, and additional music sessions carried out by teaching assistants (TAs). Qualitative data was gathered to support the quantitative video analysis results. The music therapist set up music sessions for the TAs to carry out independently, to assess whether this collaboration enhanced the development of the children’s verbal skills. Eight children aged four to eight years attending a special school were selected to participate. Half of the children were randomly allocated weekly individual music therapy sessions for 24 weeks, and the remaining children received weekly individual music therapy sessions plus a weekly music session with a TA for 24 weeks. The music therapist met regularly with the TAs to exchange information, and to demonstrate musical and singing concepts for each individual child through sharing video material. The video data from both music therapy and music sessions with TAs in sessions 3 and 22 were analysed using a time-sampling method to assess progress in verbal and social interaction. The vocal scores were extracted from this data and a statistical analysis carried out on these figures. In addition, parents of the children and the <b>TAs</b> <b>took</b> part in interviews pre- and post-intervention to assess the children’s social and verbal development in other contexts. The analysis of the vocal scores indicated that there was a statistically significant difference pre- and post-intervention for the children who had had the additional TA music sessions. This indicated that the collaborative approach was effective in enhancing verbal skills. However, due to the small number of participants, these results cannot be generalised to other situations and a larger scale investigation would need to be carried out to demonstrate more conclusive results. This study suggests that music therapists and TAs in schools can work collaboratively and that this can potentially enhance the progress that children make in music therapy, with reinforcement of verbal development strategies in the class context...|$|R
