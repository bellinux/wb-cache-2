40|$|Vasopressin, an {{antidiuretic}} hormone (ADH), plays {{an essential role}} in water regulation during dehydration. The {{purpose of this study is}} to examine novel genes that may be activated by vasopressin and evaluate the relative expression of several proteins in the renal collecting duct. 48 hours after water restriction measurements confirmed the increased expression of mRNA of AQP 2, AQP 3 and the ER stress genes AR, ATF 3, and GRP 78. We found that water restriction increases the expression of AQP 2 and AQP 3 proteins to 1. 88 ± 0. 08 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 14 fold and 2. 88 ± 0. 33 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 16 fold, respectively. Water restriction increases the expression of AR and ATF 3 proteins to 1. 33 ± 0. 14 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 13 fold and 3. 81 ± 0. 24 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 06 fold, respectively. There was an increased mRNA expression of GRP 78 with 1. 43 ± 0. 11 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 04 fold. Vasopressin implantation increases in the mRNA abundance of AQP 2 and AQP 3 proteins to 1. 88 ± 0. 09 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 07 fold and 1. 46 ± 0. 04 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 15 fold, respectively. Vasopressin implantation increases in the mRNA abundance of UTA- 1 and UTA- 3 proteins to 1. 88 ± 0. 11 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 02 fold 1. 94 ± 0. 4 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 2 fold, respectively. There was a significant increase in the mRNA abundance of ATF 3 2. 75 ± 0. 55 4 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 31 fold as well as CHOP 10 to 1. 7 ± 0. 4 <b>fold</b> <b>vs.</b> control 1. 00 ± 0. 09 fold in the renal medulla. Insights on these genes are important as vasopressin levels are high in diseases such as diabetes and congestive heart failure...|$|R

40|$|AIM: To {{determine}} {{the effect of}} tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-&#x 3 B 1;) on intestinal permeability (IP) in mice with fulminant hepatic failure (FHF), and the expression of tight junction proteins. METHODS: We selected D-lactate as an index of IP, induced FHF using D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide and D-galactosamine/TNF-&#x 3 B 1;, assessed the results using an enzymatic-spectrophotometric method, transmission electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, Western blotting and real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction. The effect of the administration of anti-TNF-&#x 3 B 1; immunoglobulin G (IgG) antibody, before the administration of D-galactosamine/lipopolysaccharide, on TNF-&#x 3 B 1; was also assessed. RESULTS: IP was significantly increased in the mouse model of FHF 6 h after injection (13. 57 1; 1. 70 mg/L, 13. 02 1; 1. 97 mg/L vs 3. 76 1; 0. 67 mg/L, P = 0. 001). Electron microscopic analysis revealed tight junction (TJ) disruptions, epithelial cell swelling, and atrophy of intestinal villi. Expression of occludin and claudin- 1 mRNA was significantly decreased in both FHF models (occludin: 0. 57 1; 0. 159 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 000; claudin- 1 : 0. 3067 1; 0. 1291 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 003), as were the distribution density of proteins in the intestinal mucosa and the levels of occludin and claudin- 1 protein (occludin: 0. 61 1; 0. 0473 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 000; claudin- 1 : 0. 6633 1; 0. 0328 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 000). Prophylactic treatment with anti-TNF-&#x 3 B 1; IgG antibody prevented changes in IP (4. 50 1; 0. 97 mg/L vs 3. 76 1; 0. 67 mg/L, P = 0. 791), intestinal tissue ultrastructure, and the mRNA levels of occludin and claudin- 1 expression (occludin: 0. 8865 1; 0. 0274 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 505; claudin- 1 : 0. 85 1; 0. 1437 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 1), and in the protein levels (occludin: 0. 9467 1; 0. 0285 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P > 0. 05; claudin- 1 : 0. 9533 1; 0. 0186 <b>fold</b> <b>vs</b> baseline, P = 0. 148). CONCLUSION: Increased in IP stemmed from the downregulation of the TJ proteins occludin and claudin- 1, and destruction of the TJ in the colon, which were induced by TNF-&#x 3 B 1; in FHF mice...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{problem of}} protein <b>folding</b> <b>vs.</b> {{aggregation}} {{was investigated in}} acylphosphatase and the amyloid protein Aβ(1 – 40) by means of nonlinear signal analysis of their chain hydrophobicity. Numerical descriptors of recurrence patterns {{provided the basis for}} statistical evaluation of folding/aggregation distinctive features. Static and dynamic approaches were used to elucidate conditions coincident with <b>folding</b> <b>vs.</b> aggregation using comparisons with known protein secondary structure classifications, site-directed mutagenesis studies of acylphosphatase, and molecular dynamics simulations of amyloid protein, Aβ(1 – 40). The results suggest that a feature derived from principal component space characterized by the smoothness of singular, deterministic hydrophobicity patches plays {{a significant role in the}} conditions governing protein aggregation...|$|R

40|$|Nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs delay {{gastric ulcer}} healing, {{and the ability}} of proton pump inhibitors to counteract this detrimental effect is debated. This study evaluates the effects of pantoprazole on experimental gastric ulcer healing in the presence of indomethacin. Rats with acetic-acid-induced gastric ulcers were orally treated for 3 or 7 days with pantoprazole (15 micromol/kg/day) or famotidine (20 micromol/kg/day), alone or in combination with indomethacin (3 micromol/kg/day). Ulcerated tissues were processed to assess ulcer area, malondialdehyde, proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and cleaved caspase- 3. Experiments on pylorus-ligated rats indicated that pantoprazole and famotidine were employed at equivalent inhibitory doses on gastric acid secretion (- 67. 9 % and - 64. 5 %, respectively). Indomethacin delayed ulcer healing both at days 3 and 7 (+ 22 and + 35 mm(2) vs control ulcer, respectively). At day 3, pantoprazole was more effective than famotidine in promoting ulcer healing in indomethacin-treated animals (- 53. 6 and - 31. 6 mm(2) vs indomethacin, respectively). Malondialdehyde levels and caspase- 3 activation in ulcers were increased by indomethacin (+ 79 % and + 3. 7 <b>folds</b> <b>vs</b> control ulcer, respectively), and these effects were counteracted by pantoprazole (- 77. 9 % and - 3. 5 <b>folds</b> <b>vs</b> indomethacin, respectively), but not famotidine. Increments of ulcer PCNA expression (+ 2. 5 <b>folds</b> <b>vs</b> normal) were enhanced further by pantoprazole or famotidine, alone or in combination with indomethacin (+ 8. 6 and + 10. 3 <b>folds</b> <b>vs</b> normal, respectively). Similar results were obtained after 7 -day treatments of ulcerated animals with test drugs. It is concluded that, along with acid suppression, pantoprazole exerts acid-independent effects on ulcer healing, which can be ascribed to a decrease in tissue oxidation and apoptosis...|$|R
