5|$|The {{high energy}} content of 178m2Hf was {{the concern of}} a DARPA-funded program in the US. This program {{determined}} {{that the possibility of}} using a nuclear isomer of hafnium (the above-mentioned 178m2Hf) to construct high-yield weapons with X-ray triggering mechanisms—an application of induced gamma emission—was <b>infeasible</b> because of its expense. See Hafnium controversy.|$|E
5|$|Examples of extortionate {{ransomware}} became {{prominent in}} May 2005. By mid-2006, Trojans such as Gpcode, TROJ.RANSOM.A, Archiveus, Krotten, Cryzip, and MayArchive began utilizing more sophisticated RSA encryption schemes, with ever-increasing key-sizes. Gpcode.AG, which was detected in June 2006, was encrypted with a 660-bit RSA public key. In June 2008, a variant known as Gpcode.AK was detected. Using a 1024-bit RSA key, {{it was believed}} {{large enough to be}} computationally <b>infeasible</b> to break without a concerted distributed effort.|$|E
5|$|Teller {{returned}} to Los Alamos in 1950 {{to work on}} the project. He insisted on involving more theorists. but many of Teller's prominent colleagues, like Fermi and Oppenheimer, were sure that the project of the H-bomb was technically <b>infeasible</b> and politically undesirable. None of the available designs were yet workable. However Soviet scientists who had worked on their own hydrogen bomb have claimed that they developed it independently.|$|E
5|$|Calcium metal melts at 842°C and boils at 1494°C, {{higher than}} its {{adjacent}} group 2 metals do. It crystallises in the face-centered cubic arrangement like strontium; above 450°C, it changes to an anisotropic hexagonal close-packed arrangement like magnesium. The density of 1.55g·cm−3 {{is the lowest}} in its group, with others decreasing towards it. Calcium can be cut with a knife with effort, although it is still harder than lead. While calcium is a poorer conductor of electricity than copper or aluminium by volume, it is a better conductor than both of them by mass due to its very low density. Although it is <b>infeasible</b> for terrestrial applications as it reacts quickly with atmospheric oxygen, its use as a conductor in space has been considered.|$|E
5|$|During 1942, Allied {{officials}} debated on {{the appropriate}} grand strategy to pursue. All agreed that defeating Germany {{was the primary}} objective. The Americans favoured a straightforward, large-scale attack on Germany through France. The Soviets were also demanding a second front. The British, on the other hand, argued that military operations should target peripheral areas to wear out German strength, leading to increasing demoralisation, and bolster resistance forces. Germany itself {{would be subject to}} a heavy bombing campaign. An offensive against Germany would then be launched primarily by Allied armour without using large-scale armies. Eventually, the British persuaded the Americans that a landing in France was <b>infeasible</b> in 1942 and they should instead focus on driving the Axis out of North Africa.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the success}} of the 1981 title Defender, Williams searched for new {{creative}} staff. Believing video games to be the future of entertainment, Newcomer left his job as a toy designer to work at the company who hired him to create game ideas as support for development staff. After a few days, he generated a list of ideas that included game ideas for The War of the Worlds and Joust, Newcomer's top two choices. Technical specifications dictated the selection; Newcomer's vision of The War of the Worlds was <b>infeasible,</b> but Joust could be accomplished with Williams' available hardware. A development team was formed, which decided to create the game using Defenders hardware.|$|E
5|$|From March 2007 until November 2012, Folding@home took {{advantage}} of the computing power of PlayStation 3s. At the time of its inception, its main streaming Cell processor delivered a 20x speed increase over PCs for some calculations, processing power which could not be found on other systems such as the Xbox 360. The PS3's high speed and efficiency introduced other opportunities for worthwhile optimizations according to Amdahl's law, and significantly changed the tradeoff between computing efficiency and overall accuracy, allowing the use of more complex molecular models at little added computing cost. This allowed Folding@home to run biomedical calculations that would have been otherwise <b>infeasible</b> computationally.|$|E
5|$|Quantitative {{methods are}} often used to ask {{questions}} about a population that is very large, making a census or a complete enumeration of all the members in that population <b>infeasible.</b> A 'sample' then forms a manageable subset of a population. In quantitative research, statistics are used to draw inferences from this sample regarding the population as a whole. The process of selecting a sample is referred to as 'sampling'. While it is usually best to sample randomly, concern with differences between specific subpopulations sometimes calls for stratified sampling. Conversely, the impossibility of random sampling sometimes necessitates nonprobability sampling, such as convenience sampling or snowball sampling.|$|E
5|$|As Taylor took office, Congress faced {{a battery}} of {{questions}} related to the Mexican Cession, acquired by the U.S. after the Mexican War and divided into military districts. It was unclear which districts would be established into states and which would become federal territories, while the question of their slave status threatened to bitterly divide Congress. Additionally, many in the South had grown increasingly angry about the aid that northerners had given to fugitive slaves. While a southern slaveowner himself, Taylor believed that slavery was economically <b>infeasible</b> in the Mexican Cession, and as such he opposed slavery in those territories as a needless source of controversy. His major goal was sectional peace, preserving the Union through legislative compromise. As the threat of Southern secession grew, he sided increasingly with antislavery northerners such as Senator William H. Seward of New York, even suggesting that he would sign the Wilmot Proviso to ban slavery in federal territories should such a bill reach his desk.|$|E
5|$|Germany and Europe {{as a whole}} {{was almost}} totally {{dependent}} on foreign oil imports. In an attempt to resolve the persistent shortage, in June 1942 Germany launched Fall Blau (Case Blue), an offensive against the Caucasian oilfields. The Red Army launched a counter-offensive on 19 November and encircled the Axis forces, who were trapped in Stalingrad on 23 November. Göring assured Hitler that the 6th Army could be supplied by air, but {{this turned out to be}} <b>infeasible.</b> Hitler's refusal to allow a retreat led to the deaths of 200,000 German and Romanian soldiers; of the 91,000 men who surrendered in the city on 31 January 1943, only 6,000 survivors returned to Germany after the war. Soviet forces continued to push the invaders westward after the failed German offensive at the Battle of Kursk and by the end of 1943 the Germans had lost most of their territorial gains in the east.|$|E
5|$|In 1943, Urey {{brought in}} Hugh S. Taylor from Princeton University {{to look at}} the problem of a usable barrier. Libby made {{progress}} on understanding the chemistry of uranium hexafluoride, leading to ideas on how to prevent corrosion and plugging. Chemical researchers at the SAM Laboratories studied fluorocarbons, which resisted corrosion, and could be used as lubricants and coolants in the gaseous diffusion plant. Despite this progress, the K-25 Project was in serious trouble without a suitable barrier, and by August 1943 it was facing cancellation. On 13 August Groves informed the Military Policy Committee, the senior committee that steered the Manhattan Project, that gaseous diffusion enrichment in excess of 50 percent was probably <b>infeasible,</b> and that the gaseous diffusion plant would be limited to producing product with a lower enrichment that could be fed into the calutrons of the Y-12 electromagnetic plant. Urey therefore began preparations to mass-produce the Norris-Adler barrier, despite its problems.|$|E
5|$|The goal of Lost Coast was to {{demonstrate}} the new high-dynamic-range rendering implemented into the Source game engine. Valve first attempted to implement high-dynamic-range rendering in Source in late 2003. The first method stored textures in RGBA color space, allowing for multisample anti-aliasing and pixel shaders to be used, but this prevented alpha mapping and fog effects from working properly, as well as making textures appear sharp and jagged. The second method involved saving two versions of a texture: one with regular data, {{and the other with}} overbrightening data. However, this technique did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing and consumed twice as much video card memory, making it <b>infeasible.</b> The third method, shown at the E3 convention in 2005, used floating point data to define the RGB color space, allowing for reasonably efficient storage of the high-dynamic-range data. However, this method also did not allow for multisample anti-aliasing, and was only compatible with Nvidia video cards, leaving ATI cards unable to run high dynamic range. The fourth and final method compromised between the second and third methods, using overbrightening textures sparingly and allowing ATI cards to render HDR in a different way to the Nvidia ones while nearly producing the same end result.|$|E
5|$|United States Army Special Forces (SF) aka Green Berets perform several doctrinal missions: {{unconventional}} warfare, foreign internal defense, special reconnaissance, {{direct action}} and counter-terrorism. These missions make Special Forces {{unique in the}} U.S. military, because they are employed throughout the three stages of the operational continuum: peacetime, conflict and war. Foreign internal defense operations, SF's main peacetime mission, {{are designed to help}} friendly developing nations by working with their military and police forces to improve their technical skills, understanding of human rights issues, and to help with humanitarian and civic action projects. Special Forces unconventional warfare capabilities provide a viable military option for a variety of operational taskings that are inappropriate or <b>infeasible</b> for conventional forces. Special Forces are the U.S. military's premier unconventional warfare force. Foreign internal defense and unconventional warfare missions are the bread and butter of Special Forces soldiers. For this reason SF candidates are trained extensively in weapons, engineering, communications and medicine. SF soldiers are taught to be warriors first and teachers second because they must be able to train their team and be able to train their allies during a FID or UW mission. Often SF units are required to perform additional, or collateral, activities outside their primary missions. These collateral activities are coalition warfare/support, combat search and rescue, security assistance, peacekeeping, humanitarian assistance, humanitarian de-mining and counter-drug operations.|$|E
25|$|Armoured fighter, {{prototype}} only. Concept {{based on}} several dogfights between Il-2 and Luftwaffe bombers. Proved <b>infeasible</b> {{due to its}} low speed, which causes it {{to be able to}} intercept only older Luftwaffe bombers.|$|E
25|$|Even {{if it is}} {{possible}} to devise a specific way to remove vectors from the set until it becomes a basis, this approach may become <b>infeasible</b> in practice if the set is large or infinite.|$|E
25|$|By {{the late}} 1980s, the medical {{animation}} {{had become a}} distinct modality of physiological and surgical instruction. By that point, researchers had suggested that the 3D medical animations could illustrate physiological, molecular or anatomical concepts {{that might otherwise be}} <b>infeasible.</b>|$|E
25|$|For {{technical}} reasons {{the use of}} leaded additives is still permitted worldwide for the formulation of some grades of aviation gasoline such as 100LL, because the required octane rating would be technically <b>infeasible</b> to reach {{without the use of}} leaded additives.|$|E
25|$|The {{proposed}} Chuo Shinkansen maglev in Japan {{was estimated}} to cost approximately US$82 billion to build, with a route requiring long tunnels. A Tokaido maglev route replacing the current Shinkansen would cost 1/10 the cost, as no new tunnel would be needed, but noise pollution issues made this <b>infeasible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Whether the {{hierarchical}} Bayes method confers a substantial advantage in practice remains controversial, however. Moreover, this fully Bayesian approach {{is limited to}} analyzing relatively small numbers of sequences or taxa because the space of all possible trees rapidly becomes too vast, making it computationally <b>infeasible</b> for chain samples to converge in {{a reasonable amount of}} time.|$|E
25|$|Once {{it became}} {{apparent}} that White's candidacy was <b>infeasible,</b> McGovern asked Senator Gaylord Nelson to be his running mate. Nelson declined but suggested Senator Thomas Eagleton of Missouri, whom McGovern ultimately chose. McGovern's team only conducted minimal vetting of Eagleton as the senator had been previously recommended by many of the prospective running mates.|$|E
25|$|Although it does handle {{interreflection}} {{and optical}} effects such as refraction accurately, traditional ray tracing {{is also not}} necessarily photorealistic. True photorealism occurs when the rendering equation is closely approximated or fully implemented. Implementing the rendering equation gives true photorealism, as the equation describes every physical effect of light flow. However, this is usually <b>infeasible</b> given the computing resources required.|$|E
25|$|Around this time, {{in early}} 1968, the {{prospect}} of putting the TVR Tina into production became <b>infeasible</b> due to the significant expense of building a steel-bodied car. The project was cancelled, with the only two existing Tinas being the two prototype cars. Bill Last also approached TVR and suggested a merger so that TVR Engineering could begin building the Trident in volume. TVR declined this offer.|$|E
25|$|Like the simplex {{algorithm}} of Dantzig, the criss-cross {{algorithm is}} a basis-exchange algorithm that pivots between bases. However, the criss-cross algorithm need not maintain feasibility, but can pivot rather from a feasible basis to an <b>infeasible</b> basis. The criss-cross algorithm {{does not have}} polynomial time-complexity for linear programming. Both algorithms visit all2Dcorners of a (perturbed) cube in dimensionD, the Klee–Minty cube, in the worst case.|$|E
25|$|Coule {{has argued}} that schemes, {{such as the one}} {{proposed}} by Alcubierre, are <b>infeasible</b> because matter placed en route of the intended path of a craft must be placed at superluminal speed—that constructing an Alcubierre drive requires an Alcubierre drive even if the metric that allows it is physically meaningful. Coule further argues that an analogous objection will apply to any proposed method of constructing an Alcubierre drive.|$|E
25|$|Despite the mid-20th century failure, {{the idea}} of underriver tunnels, which is relied on much {{advanced}} metro technologies, is still on Kiev city planner's table. Tunnel projects are recently being included in some of proposed Kiev development plans {{as a way to}} move the main traffic flows in the city center underground. However, most experts agree that such projects are both unaffordable and technically <b>infeasible</b> at this time.|$|E
25|$|Automated {{theorem proving}} {{refers to the}} {{development}} of computer programs that search and find derivations (formal proofs) of mathematical theorems. Finding derivations is a difficult task because the search space can be very large; an exhaustive search of every possible derivation is theoretically possible but computationally <b>infeasible</b> for many systems of interest in mathematics. Thus complicated heuristic functions are developed to attempt to find a derivation in less time than a blind search.|$|E
25|$|Camellia is {{considered}} a modern safe cipher. Even using the smaller key size option (128 bits), it's considered <b>infeasible</b> to break it by brute-force attack on the keys with current technology. There are no known successful attacks that weaken the cipher considerably. The cipher has been approved {{for use by the}} ISO/IEC, the European Union's NESSIE project and the Japanese CRYPTREC project. The Japanese cipher has security levels and processing abilities comparable to the AES/Rijndael cipher.|$|E
25|$|The current Metro system {{consists}} of three separate projects. There are two light rail lines (the Blue Line and the Green Line), which together run on {{a little more than}} one-mile of shared track through downtown Minneapolis. The BRT Red Line serves {{as an extension of the}} Blue Line across the Minnesota River, where it connects with southern suburbs at four different stations. Low ridership projections would have made the required bridge for an extension of the Blue Line economically <b>infeasible.</b>|$|E
25|$|An optimal {{solution}} need not exist, for two reasons. First, if two constraints are inconsistent, then no feasible solution exists: For instance, the constraints x≥2 and x≤1 cannot be satisfied jointly; in this case, {{we say that}} the LP is <b>infeasible.</b> Second, when the polytope is unbounded {{in the direction of}} the gradient of the objective function (where the gradient of the objective function is the vector of the coefficients of the objective function), then no optimal value is attained.|$|E
25|$|Despite some successes by the anti-Hapsburg Kuruc army, {{such as the}} near-capture of the Austrian Emperor Joseph I by Ádám Balogh, {{the rebels}} lost the decisive Battle of Trencin in 1708. When Austrians {{defeated}} the Kuruc uprising in 1711, Rákóczi was in Poland. He later fled to France, then to Turkey, and died in 1735 in Tekirdağ (Rodosto). Afterward, to make further armed resistance <b>infeasible,</b> the Austrians demolished most of the castles {{on the border between}} the now-reclaimed territories occupied earlier by the Ottomans and Royal Hungary.|$|E
25|$|Other reports {{include a}} single tooth found in Moutier, Switzerland. Originally named by Janensch in 1920 as Labrosaurus meriani, the tooth was later {{referred}} Ceratosaurus sp. (of unknown species) by Madsen and Welles. Soto and Perea, in 2008, described teeth from the Tacuarembó Formation in Uruguay that show features diagnostic for Ceratosaurus. These authors, however, stress that {{a referral to}} Ceratosaurus is <b>infeasible</b> due to the scant remains, and note that the referral of the European and African Material to Ceratosaurus has to be viewed with caution.|$|E
25|$|Given {{the rules}} of any two-person game with {{a finite number of}} positions, one can always trivially {{construct}} a minimax algorithm that would exhaustively traverse the game tree. However, since for many non-trivial games such an algorithm would require an <b>infeasible</b> amount of time to generate a move in a given position, a game is not considered to be solved weakly or strongly unless the algorithm can be run by existing hardware in a reasonable time. Many algorithms rely on a huge pre-generated database, and are effectively nothing more.|$|E
25|$|Control of Bilbao {{was very}} important, {{but the lack}} of united action by the Carlist forces made it {{impossible}} to take the town by conventional military means. The internecine rivalries and the lack of military sense among most of the commanding officers made it <b>infeasible</b> to carry out Maroto's proposed strategy. A few days later, he was ordered to transfer control to Brigadier Sarasa and to await orders for a new destination. The war continued, and the Carlists could not carry out a successful campaign due to the schemes and disagreements of their own leaders and generals.|$|E
25|$|Its {{primary goal}} {{continues}} to be to transform education, by enabling children in low-income countries {{to have access to}} content, media and computer-programming environments. At the time that the program launched, the typical retail price for a laptop was considerably in excess of $1,000 (US), so it was <b>infeasible</b> to achieve this objective without also bringing a low-cost machine to production. This became the OLPC XO Laptop, a low-cost and low-power laptop computer. The project was originally funded by member organizations such as AMD, eBay, Google, Marvell Technology Group, News Corporation, Nortel. Chi Mei Corporation, Red Hat, and Quanta provided in-kind support.|$|E
25|$|Such simple {{treatment}} for environmental pollution on a wider scale {{might have had}} greater merit in earlier centuries when physical survival was often the highest imperative, human population and densities were lower, technologies were simpler and their byproducts more benign. But these are often no longer the case. Furthermore, advances have enabled measurement of concentrations not possible before. The use of statistical methods in evaluating outcomes has given currency {{to the principle of}} probable harm in cases where assessment is warranted but resorting to deterministic models is impractical or <b>infeasible.</b> In addition, consideration of the environment beyond direct impact on human beings has gained prominence.|$|E
25|$|It was {{originally}} {{intended for the}} host of the tournament to be rotated between the countries of the three shareholders: India, South Africa and Australia. The broadcasting agreement also demands that at least five of the first ten editions are to be held in India. However, Australia has yet to be considered due to its unsuitable weather in September and due to its time zone being undesirable for the broadcaster. South Africa first hosted in 2010 but India has since been the first preference for hosting. South Africa was only chosen to host in 2012 when situations made it <b>infeasible</b> for India to host.|$|E
