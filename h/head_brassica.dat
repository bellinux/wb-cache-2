50|$|It is of {{note that}} many {{varieties}} actively benefit from being transplanted as severing the taproot encourages bushier root growth. Traditionally nearly all <b>heading</b> <b>brassica</b> are sown {{in a separate}} seed bed, thinned, and the best ones planted in a prepared bed after about 6-8 weeks. Many pests want to eat baby brassica; this in combination with its long growing season makes planting brassica from plugs a much easier option.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Crops {{belonging}} to the Brassica genus are widely grown in Turkey. Cabbages {{are one of the}} most important Brassica vegetable crops in Turkey. The aim of this study was to determine similarities and differences regarding morphological variation of white <b>head</b> cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> oleracea var. capitata subvar. alba) genetic resources collected from different eco-geographical regions of Turkey. Data from field experiments conducted between 1999 and 2001 were analysed by multiple variance analysis. Cluster analysis based on 12 quantitative and 10 qualitative variables identified 10 groups. The dendogram was prepared to evaluate morphological similarity between the white head cabbage geno-types. Morphological variability is high among the white head cabbage genotypes of Turkey. As a con-clusion, the genotypes evaluated in this study dis-play a wide diversity of characters for selection and combination of interesting genotypes for important characters to obtain improved varieties.

40|$|The {{characteristic}} curd phenotype of the Brassica cauliflower {{consists of}} proliferating, arrested inflorescence and floral meristems. Recent {{analysis of the}} similar phenotype in the ap 1 - 1 /cal- 1 mutant of the related crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana has led to speculation that the orthologous genes from Brassica oleracea L. {{may be responsible for}} this characteristic trait. Application of molecular genetic analysis to this hypothesis allows the presentation of a genetic model based on specific, mapped loci of BoCAL and BoAP 1. This model accounts for differences in the stage of arrest between the heading phenotypes of cauliflower (B. oleracea var. botrytis L.) and Calabrese broccoli (B. oleracea var. italica Plenck), and is also predictive in accounting for intermediate stages of arrest similar to those observed in Sicilian Purple types. Further molecular genetic analysis characterised three independent loci of the floral meristem identity gene BoAP 1. Integration of this data into the genetic model proposed for curd development, suggests a combination of point mutations and expression thresholds of several copies of the key meristem identity genes BoCAL and BoAP 1 respectively may account for the development of curd tissue in the Brassica cauliflower. The association of alleles of the BoCAL-a gene with the curding phenotypes of B. oleracea was also demonstrated through a survey of over 200 crop accessions. This reveals strong correlations between specific BoCAL-a alleles and discrete inflorescence morphologies, and allows the presentation of a possible scenario for the domestication of cauliflowers. Molecular genetic analysis of BoCAL-a utilising monosomic addition lines has also demonstrated the potential for integration of the genetic and cytogenetic maps of B. oleracea. Such analysis may have significant utility for physical characterisation of replicated loci in B. oleracea, prior {{to the development of a}} strong physical map. Further examination of inflorescence morphologies amongst the <b>heading</b> <b>brassicas</b> revealed a shared trait, termed Fused Inflorescence. Preliminary investigation suggests this trait may be under the control of multiple loci, providing a possible indication of the delineation between heading and sprouting B. oleracea crops...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The white <b>head</b> cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> oleracea L.), was {{cultivated}} {{including the}} Stone Age and gained a spread {{in almost all}} of the region of temperate climate on Earth, even the warm climate areas, having a large ecological plasticity (Apahidean, 2007). It is cultivated for a large spectrum of use, mostly in culinary art, it is eaten uncooked, preserved in salt, with or without meat, refrigerated or dehydrated (Chilom, 1991), but is also a basic material for canned use, especially for vitamin juice, usually mixed with carrot juice. This vegetable is used not only for human alimentation, but for natural medicine, too. To obtain extra early cabbage productions in our country represents a large interest, mostly concerning the regions of the Transylvanian Plateau, because of the cool climate, the crops are gathered later, also in the Danube’s Plane, or the country’s western Planes. The research objective was to study of the effect of Agryl P- 19 on the environmental factors on early cabbage cultivated in plastic tunnel and field. The main line was, to obtain an early, but quality production. In the experiment it was used six hybrids and one early cabbage cultivar, the non-woven agrotextile Agryl P- 19, to cover directly of cultures in plastic tunnel and field as well...|$|R
50|$|Downy mildew is {{a disease}} of major {{importance}} on the horticultural Brassica species. It is most serious on the flowerhead types (cauliflower, broccoli), less serious on the leaf brassicas (cabbage, Brussels sprouts, and least serious on the root brassicas (turnips, swedes) and oil brassicas (rape). The pathogen persists as oospores in the soil. Attacks are most important in Brassica seedbeds, with infection appearing as yellow speckling of the upper surface of seedling leaves, and white mildew on the lower surface. Severely affected seedlings are stunted or killed. Similar symptoms appear on leaves in the field, causing premature senescence and favouring bacterial spoilage in the cold store after harvest. Affected Brussels sprouts show black spotting, which reduces their market quality. The <b>heads</b> of flowerhead <b>brassicas</b> can be severely affected, and become unmarketable.|$|R
40|$|More {{and more}} RING finger genes {{were found to}} be implicated in various {{important}} biological processes. In the present study, a total of 731 RING domains in 715 predicted proteins were identified in Brassica rapa genome (AA, 2 n = 20), which were further divided into eight types: RING-H 2 (371), RING-HCa (215), RING-HCb (47), RING-v (44), RING-C 2 (38), RING-D (10), RING-S/T (5) and RING-G (1). The 715 RING finger proteins were further classified into 51 groups according to the presence of additional domains. 700 RING finger protein genes were mapped to the 10 chromosomes of B. rapa with a range of 47 to 111 genes for each chromosome. 667 RING finger protein genes were expressed in {{at least one of the}} six tissues examined, indicating their involvement in various physiological and developmental processes in B. rapa. Hierarchical clustering analysis of RNA-seq data divided them into seven major groups, one of which includes 231 members preferentially expressed in leaf, and constitutes then a panel of gene candidates for studying the genetic and molecular mechanisms of leafy <b>head</b> traits in <b>Brassica</b> crops. Our results lay the foundation for further studies on the classification, evolution and putative functions of RING finger protein genes in Brassica species...|$|R
40|$|Leaf <b>heads</b> of cabbage (<b>Brassica</b> oleracea), Chinese cabbage (B. rapa), and lettuce (Lactuca sativa) are {{important}} vegetables that supply mineral nutrients, crude fiber and vitamins {{in the human}} diet. Head size, head shape, head weight, and heading time contribute to yield and quality. In an attempt to investigate genetic basis of leafy head in Chinese cabbage (B. rapa), we took advantage of recent technical advances of genome resequencing to perform quantitative trait locus (QTL) mapping using 150 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from the cross between heading and non-heading Chinese cabbage. The resequenced genomes of the parents uncovered more than 1 million SNPs. Genotyping of RILs using the high-quality SNPs assisted by Hidden Markov Model (HMM) generated a recombination map. The raw genetic map revealed some physical assembly error and missing fragments in the reference genome that reduced the quality of SNP genotyping. By deletion of the genetic markers in which recombination rates higher than 20 %, we have obtained a high-quality genetic map with 2209 markers and detected 18 QTLs for 6 head traits, from which 3 candidate genes were selected. These QTLs provide the foundation for study of genetic basis of leafy heads and the other complex traits...|$|R
40|$|Head cabbage is a {{vegetable}} crop with enhanced uptake of nutrients {{resulting in a}} large vegeta-tive biomass accumulation for a relatively short period. Balanced mineral nutrition with macro-and micronutrients is a necessary precondition for the normal plant growth and high yields of good quality. Plants absorb nitrogen from the soil mainly as ammonium nitrogen and nitrate nitro-gen. Cabbage is {{a good source of}} carbohydrates (mainly sugars), vitamins, minerals, amino acids and other biologically active substances (Huxsoll et al. 1989). In most non-leguminous crop plants, leafs are the dominant organ in the amino acid synthesis and distribution (Noctor et al. 2002). The leaf amino acid content increases with en-hanced supply of nitrogen during growth. The content of amino acids is a good indicator for the quality of vegetables. From about 80 known amino acids only 23 are important for the human diet. Essential amino acids are those that cannot be synthesized de novo by the organism, and there-fore must be supplied in food. Nine amino acids generally regarded as essential for humans are: isoleucine, leucine, lysine, threonine, tryptophan, methionine, valine, phenylalanine and histidine. Some essential amino acids have been observed to be deficient in different plant food products; for example lysine is deficient in wheat, tryptophan in maize, and methionine in legumes. Generally, fluctuations in the amino acid proportion in plants might reflect changes in the source of nitrogen for growth (Peoples et al. 1987). The aim of our study was to establish changes in different nitrogenous forms and in the composi-tion of amino acids synthesized in head cabbage leaves after treatments with different rates and sources of nitrogen fertilizers.
