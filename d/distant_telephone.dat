5000|$|As stated on its Wikipedia page, [...] "Brantford Ontario is {{sometimes}} {{known by the}} nickname [...] "The Telephone City" [...] as former city resident Alexander Graham Bell conducted the first <b>distant</b> <b>telephone</b> call from the community to Paris, Ontario in 1876." ...|$|E
50|$|Digits are {{represented}} by two simultaneous tones selected from a set of five (MF 2/5), six (MF 2/6), or eight (MF 2/8) frequencies. The frequency combinations are played, {{one at a time}} for each digit, to the remote multi-frequency receiver in a <b>distant</b> <b>telephone</b> exchange. MF was used for signaling in trunking applications.|$|E
5000|$|False Answer Supervision is a misconfiguration of telco equipment, by {{negligence}} or design, {{which causes}} billing to start {{as soon as}} the <b>distant</b> <b>telephone</b> begins ringing, even if a call is busy or no answer. The cost is typically subtle but recurring as subscribers repeatedly pay some small amount for calls which were never completed.|$|E
50|$|In 1878, the Bell Telephone Company {{began to}} use {{two-wire}} circuits (called the local loop) from each user's telephone to end offices which performed any necessary electrical switching to allow voice signals to be transmitted to more <b>distant</b> <b>telephones.</b>|$|R
50|$|Jingguang railway and Jingyuan railway {{cross the}} {{district}}. In addition, {{the district is}} serviced by 4 branch railways and 24 railway stations. Jingshi Expressway also goes through the district. The four main roads are the Jing-Zhou, Jing-Bao, Jing-Yuan, Jing-Liang roads, with branch roads to townships and villages. The total length of roads is up to 1800 km. Tanggu Port is only 180 km <b>distant.</b> The programme-controlled <b>telephone</b> capacity supports 128,000 phone sets.|$|R
40|$|Tele-Onthaal is a Flemish volunteer-based organisation, which {{provides}} telephonic support {{for people in}} distress (Telephonic Emergency Service). In 2002, Tele-Onthaal started offering online support. This online support offers new perspectives {{with regard to the}} realisation of the objectives of the organisation: adolescents are now more frequently reached and more delicate issues are discussed. Online support is an unfamiliar method though, and has some unique characteristics, which pose questions with regard to the worth of this method. For example: isnâ€™t online conversation more <b>distant</b> than <b>telephone</b> calls and how can volunteers deal with this distance? Does online contact provide the volunteer with sufficient information on the caller for well-focused assistance? This article reports on the experiences with online support and the strategies used by Tele-Onthaal to deal with its special characteristics...|$|R
25|$|Stephen D. Julstrom of Shure Brothers, Inc. (Evanston, Illinois) {{was granted}} a patent in 1987 for a {{teleconferencing}} system that used special directionally gated microphones mixed automatically and sent to a <b>distant</b> party via <b>telephone</b> line. The return signal from the distant party was compared in strength to the local mix to determine which party was to be most prominent in the overall mix. Any interrupting party was given priority. Four years later, Shure would introduce the AMS4000 and AMS8000 automixers for sound reinforcement; mixers which required the use of special directional condenser microphones of the Shure AMS Series.|$|R
5000|$|Professor John Seddon, who is {{an author}} and {{occupational}} psychologist, started a campaign for an alternative way to deliver Universal Credit in January 2011. He argued that you can't deliver high-variety services through [...] "cheaper" [...] transaction channels, and argued that in fact this would drive costs up. John Seddon wrote {{an open letter to}} Iain Duncan Smith and Lord Freud as the start of a campaign to call a halt to the current plans and, instead, to embark on a [...] "systems approach" [...] which he thought would be better. Seddon started a petition in 2011 calling for Iain Duncan Smith to [...] "rethink the centralised, IT-dominated service design for the delivery of Universal Credit". His petition went on: [...] "Evidence from a significant number of housing benefit offices demonstrates that local, face-to-face processing of benefits is cheaper and faster than <b>distant</b> automated <b>telephone</b> and online processing. Processing claims face-to-face is not only cheaper and faster but an excellent way of ensuring that vulnerable people understand both their entitlement and their obligations. Feedback from claimants is overwhelmingly positive when their claim is dealt with face-to-face by an expert." ...|$|R
40|$|Extremely long {{distance}} control, hardly reachable actuator/target and costly network development are some concerns within a distance control system. Such control is computer control for advertisements placed in tricky areas as locations over the bridge, at a junction, etc. The provider usually performs system inactivation {{in order to}} save energy. But until now, it is still difficult to find a system that can be turned on and off in remote manner. That is why the <b>distant</b> control using <b>telephone</b> can be the best alternative solution. Not only can the telephone be used in wide range of area, but also easily operated. The developed circuit in this research uses dual tone multiple frequency (DTMF). It is operated by pressing telephone button as control input for microcontroller. The microcontroller processes the input and controls the computer via relay and serial port. The result of experiment shows that the developed application is able to shut down and turn on computer as well as to apply software remotely...|$|R
5000|$|The {{children}} {{trace the}} owner of the house to the blandly named [...] "John Henry Smith", who lives in a <b>distant</b> town. Fatty <b>telephones</b> Mr Smith and alerts him to the fact that someone knows about the secret room. Expecting the mysterious Mr Smith to come to Peterswood and check out what is happening at Milton House, Fatty disguises himself with his wig and teeth and goes to the house at midnight. He manages to get inside and discovers a notebook written in code in the secret room. However, he is captured by the men - who are foreigners - and forced to write a letter to the other children, to try to trap them inside the house. Fatty writes a note, but he writes another, secret note in invisible ink, warning the children and telling them to call the police. Luckily, Bets notices that Fatty's note smells of oranges - orange juice was used as the secret ink - and the others realise the danger Fatty is in, and telephone their favourite policeman, Inspector Jenks. Meanwhile, Fatty escapes from a locked room and manages to meet Inspector Jenks outside the house and hand him the code book. The police round up the villains - international thieves - and all is well.|$|R
40|$|Throughout history, {{people have}} always felt the wish to meet, to talk and to interact. For getting in contact with a <b>distant</b> person, the <b>telephone</b> was the {{preferred}} medium for a long time. But hearing the word one person speaks makes up {{only a part of}} the message. Body language {{is an integral part of}} how humans communicate. As worldwide networking increases and more and more personal computers are equipped with multimedia capabilities, desktop videoconferencing systems have become more and more popular. In many cases these programs support the connection and interaction of only two participants. This report describes how the graphical user interface of an existing point-to-point videoconferencing application has been extended in order to support multiparty conferences. Designing a graphical user interface for point-to-point videoconferences is already a challenging task. In a multiparty scenario the problems of a two-party conference are sometimes exacerbated and sometimes new, specific problems appear. Multiparty conferences can take place in many different scenarios like moderated or non-moderated meetings, lectures, exams or presentations. Some of these scenarios allow the participants to start side conversations. Providing a sense for the group or establishing eye contact gets more difficult in a conference with more than two attendees. Furthermore we have to deal with the so-called visibility problem, i. e., probably not all of the participants can be displayed at the same time due to the limited screen size. Additionally, a developer of graphical user interfaces has to keep the usability aspects in mind...|$|R
