500|$|After {{recording}} the second {{version of the}} song, Lennon {{wanted to do something}} different with it, as Martin remembered: [...] "He'd wanted it as a gentle dreaming song, but he said it had come out too raucous. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I could write him a new line-up with the strings. So I wrote a new score (with four trumpets and three cellos) and we recorded that, but he didn't like it." [...] Meanwhile, on 8 and 9 December, another basic track was recorded, using Mellotron, electric guitar, piano, backwards-recorded cymbals, and swarmandel, an Indian version of the zither. After reviewing the tapes of Martin's version and the original, Lennon told Martin that he liked both versions, although Martin had to tell Lennon that the orchestral score was at a faster tempo and in a higher key (B major) than the first version (A major). Lennon said, [...] "You can fix it, George", giving Martin and Geoff Emerick, the band's recording engineer, the difficult task of joining the two takes together. With only a pair of editing scissors, two tape machines and a vari-speed control, Emerick compensated for the differences in key and speed by increasing the speed of the first version and decreasing the speed of the second. He then spliced the versions together, starting the orchestral score {{in the middle of the}} second chorus. (Since the first version did not include a chorus after the first verse, he also spliced in the first seven words of the chorus from elsewhere in the first version.) The pitch-shifting in joining the versions gave Lennon's lead vocal a slightly other-worldly [...] "swimming" [...] quality.|$|E
2500|$|Apart {{from the}} {{betrayal}} of the POUMists, the terror and the murder of Nin and Smillie, Orwell had been depressed by {{the attitude of the}} British press. [...] "In Spain ... I saw newspaper reports which did not bear any relation to the facts ... I saw, in fact, history being written not in terms of what happened but of what ought to have happened according to various party lines." [...] Carr writes, [...] "He was appalled at the treatment of the May days as a 'Trotskyist Revolt' in papers like the News Chronicle which simply swallowed uncritically the Communist line; or Ralph Bates' report in The New Republic that POUM militiamen were playing football with Fascist troops ... Given this supresio vero by interested parties, how could true history be written? Propaganda would pass as truth; 'facts' could be manipulated. Those who monopolized communication could create their own history after the eventâ€”the nightmare of Nineteen Eighty-Four." [...] Orwell attacked sections of the left wing press for suppressing the truth about Spain, indicting the Communists for instigating a [...] "reign of terror"; and he never forgave Kingsley Martin, the editor of the New Statesman who turned down his articles on the Spanish Civil War {{on the grounds that they}} [...] "could cause trouble." [...] Malcolm Muggeridge remembered: [...] "Once when we were lunching at a Greek restaurant in Percy Street <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I would mind changing places. I readily agreed but asked him why. He said that he just couldn't bear to look at Kingsley Martin's corrupt face, which, as Kingsley was lunching at an adjoining table, was unavoidable from where he had been sitting before." [...] "Ten years ago it was almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Communism; today it is almost impossible to get anything printed in favour of Anarchism or 'Trotskyism'," [...] Orwell wrote bitterly in 1938.|$|E
2500|$|Tendulkar's {{allegations}} {{were supported by}} former teammates such as Zaheer Khan, Harbhajan Singh and V. V. S. Laxman. Zaheer called Chappell a [...] "control freak" [...] and said, [...] "After he was appointed {{the coach of the}} Indian team, he once came upto me and told [...] "Zaheer, you will not be playing for India till I remain the coach". He also added that the two-year term under Chappell was [...] "easily the worst and darkest phase" [...] that he could remember. Harbhajan said, [...] "Chappell destroyed Indian cricket {{to such an extent that}} it required at least 3 years to again get back on track. The worst part was some players in that team, who sucked upto the coach and would supply selective misinformation creating bigger rifts". He also talked about the email leak, [...] "Sourav was batting out there in the middle and this man was typing a critical e-mail against Sourav, sitting right there in that dressing room. He had no interest in the proceedings of the match. There were seven guys that he wanted to get rid of. Sourav was his primary target followed by myself, Virender Sehwag, Ashish Nehra, Zaheer Khan and Yuvraj Singh". Laxman was also critical of Chappell in saying that Chappell took Indian cricket [...] "backwards" [...] during his coaching tenure. Laxman also recalled an incident from 2006, [...] "This happened in 2006 at the Wankhede Stadium when India played versus England. Yuvraj Singh was picked ahead of me. We were going to the West Indies for a four-Test series after that and <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I would open. I mentioned in 2000 I had decided I would not open anymore after it didn't work for me in the first four years. I was consistent in the middle order since 2000. Chappell asked me my age and said - Don't you think 31 is too young an age to sit at home? I was astonished to hear this. I had a very good run under him. I was the second highest run scorer under him." ...|$|E

60|$|Then <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I {{had seen}} its Chief, a certain Umslopogaas or Bulalio. I answered, Yes, that I {{had met him}} there {{for the first time}} and thought him a very {{remarkable}} man.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I would {{swear to}} be secret, and that, if I {{did not agree}} to what he proposed, I would {{nevertheless}} never betray him.

60|$|<b>He</b> then <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> {{we had not}} a {{camp near}} London, showing that he took me for an Englishman.

60|$|At dinner I {{found myself}} {{between him and}} Lord Carlisle, and perceiving, perhaps, {{that the nature of}} my {{reflections}} was of rather an amusing order, <b>he</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> confidentially <b>if</b> I did not like fun, to which I assented with fervor.

5000|$|The {{four men}} began {{planning}} Streets of Fire while completing 48 Hrs.

[...] "People think that he doesn't like women and he knows that's not true. I think that's going to be demonstrated even more clearly in his next films. He told me he's going to do this new thing: he's going to put a female character right in the centre of the narrative." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{removed from}} Italy, and went next to Lausanne--the {{place from which}} I am now writing to you. The post of this morning has brought me news, later and fuller than any I had {{received}} thus far, of the widow of the murdered man. The letter lies before me while I write. It comes from {{a friend of my}} early days, who has seen her, and spoken to her--who has been the first to inform her that the report of my death in Madeira was false. He writes, at a loss to account for the violent agitation which she showed on hearing that I was still alive, that I was married, and that I had an infant son. <b>He</b> <b>asks</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I can explain it. He speaks in terms of sympathy for her--a young and beautiful woman, buried in the retirement of a fishing-village on the Devonshire coast; her father dead; her family estranged from her, in merciless disapproval of her marriage. He writes words which might have cut me to the heart, but for a closing passage in his letter, which seized my whole attention the instant I came to it, and which has forced from me the narrative that these pages contain.|$|R
6000|$|... "That," [...] he {{answered}} with {{no loss of}} promptness, [...] "is what even Chad himself asked me last night. <b>He</b> <b>asked</b> <b>me</b> <b>if</b> I don't mind the loss--well, the loss of an opulent future.
