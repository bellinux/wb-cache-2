6000|$|... "No? You {{will never}} persuade {{me that you}} are not. Why, {{what else can you}} ladies sit up half the night talking about <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> rooms?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will bring}} in the ropes next time I go out. Mind and place them <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> You will know that that night at eleven o'clock your son {{will be on the}} terrace {{awaiting}} you.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You'll {{neither of}} you sleep <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds</b> to-night. Another sell for the mosquitoes, isn't it? I propose {{to break up the}} camp and start marching in an hour.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "It’s all rot," [...] {{said the}} mate, tossing the spirits down his throat, [...] "and it’s no use either; you can’t {{run away from}} a ghost; it’s {{just as likely to}} be <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> as {{anywhere}} else. Good-night." ...|$|E
6000|$|Trick. You fancy all this; I {{would not}} hurt {{you for the}} world. Come, you shall see how well I love you. [Kisses him: Mrs BRAIN. pricks her.] Oh! I think you have needles growing <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> [...] [Both rise up.|$|E
6000|$|... "Now! now! now! you be nice-goot, {{and tell}} me this first. When you {{are out in the}} garden, taking your little lazy lady's walks on a shiny-sunny day, is it all the same to your eyes as if you were lying <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> in the middles of the night?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But then I {{should be}} worse," [...] ses Bill. [...] "I want cheerful company when I’m like that. I should very likely come ’ome and ’arf kill you all <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds.</b> You don’t ’arf know what I’m like. Last night was nothing, else I should ’ave remembered it." ...|$|R
5000|$|My good friends, this is {{the second}} time there has come back from Germany to Downing Street peace with honour. I believe it is peace for our time. We thank you from the bottom of our hearts. Now I {{recommend}} you go home, and sleep quietly <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds.</b>|$|R
6000|$|JOHNSON. Well: Marzo's <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> Lady {{wants to}} make a kitchen of the Sheikh's {{audience}} chamber, and to put me and the Kid handy in his bedroom in case Marzo gets erysipelas and breaks out violent. From what I can make out, she means to make herself matron of this institution. I spose it's all right, isn't it? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{must not}} forget it anywhere. I think that plan will not do. How {{would you like}} to find {{caterpillars}} walking <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> to hear sick pussies mewing in the night, to have beetles clinging to your clothes, or see mice, bugs, and birds tumbling downstairs whenever the door was open?" [...] said her mother.|$|E
60|$|CATHERINE (entering hastily, full of good news). Raina--(she pronounces it Rah-eena, {{with the}} stress on the ee) Raina--(she goes to the bed, expecting to find Raina there.) Why, where--(Raina looks into the room.) Heavens! child, are you out in the night air instead of <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed?</b> You'll catch your death. Louka {{told me you were}} asleep.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{on earth}} are you young fry doing up {{at this time of}} night?" [...] he asked angrily. [...] "You should have been <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds</b> two hours ago. And with a roaring fire on a night that's hot enough to melt a brass monkey! Have you taken leave of your senses?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{that is part}} of Monmouth's plan to come at you {{across the}} moors, by way of Chedzoy, {{avoiding}} your only outpost, and falling upon you <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds,</b> all unawares. Lord! sir, do not take my word for it. Send out your scouts, and I dare swear they'll not need go far before they come upon the enemy." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Never mind {{who says}} so. You did it, {{and it is}} useless for you to deny it. Here are the two guns you took from the gun rack and {{afterwards}} hid <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds.</b> And here is the despicable note you, Brown, wrote and mailed to Mr. Lacy," [...] and the colonel held out the communication.|$|R
6000|$|... "A bonny night ye hae made o't, Mr. Steenie," [...] said Jenny Rintherout, who, {{impatient}} {{of remaining}} so long unnoticed, now presented {{herself to the}} young fisherman--"A bonny night ye hae made o't, tramping about wi' gaberlunzies, and getting yoursell hunted wi' worricows, when ye suld be sleeping <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> like your father, honest man." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm {{not so sure}} of that," [...] a light skirmisher {{broke his}} silence for the first time. [...] "Do you mean to say," [...] he asked of the first speaker, [...] "that you would not mind being found dead <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> to-morrow morning, and that you would rather like it if that were {{actually}} the end of you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then all was still--as {{still as}} {{when you wake up}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> in a dark room from a bizarre and {{agitated}} dream. The lighter rocked slightly; the rain was still falling. Two groping hands took hold of his bruised sides from behind, and the Capataz's voice whispered, in his ear, [...] "Silence, for your life! Silence! The steamer has stopped." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Wendy, Wendy, {{when you}} are {{sleeping}} <b>in</b> <b>your</b> silly <b>bed</b> you might be flying about with me saying funny things to the stars.' ...|$|R
60|$|DEARTH (quickly at work). I oughtn't to {{have brought}} you out so late; {{you should be}} tucked up <b>in</b> <b>your</b> cosy <b>bed</b> at home.|$|R
5000|$|... "But I...I am Montag!" [...] {{the magician}} stammers helplessly. Then {{he is back}} onstage, dazed, reciting the same speech that he {{delivered}} to his audience {{at the beginning of}} the film: [...] "What is real? How do you know that at this second you aren't asleep <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds,</b> dreaming that you are here in this theater?" [...] And in the audience an unimpressed Sherry turns to Jack, muttering, [...] "You know what I think? I think he's a phony." ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{there was}} a pause, during which Silverbridge sat {{with his hands in}} his pockets trying to look unconcerned. [...] "But if you've got it here, and feel it as I do,"--the poor man as he said this put his hand upon his heart,--"you can't sleep <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> till it's out. I did that thing that they said I did." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know you}} can always bring Benny. There's {{plenty of room for}} both of you <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> But now when you go back with him be careful of the lamp. I put a fresh piece of rag in and there's plenty of grease. You can blow up a coal on the hearth. I covered the fire; only be careful." ...|$|E
6000|$|How do you know, deep underground, Hid <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> {{from sight}} and sound, Without a turn in temperature, With weather life can scarce endure, That light {{has won a}} fraction's strength, And day put on some moments' length, Whereof in merest rote will come, Weeks hence, mild airs that do not numb; [...] O crocus root, how do you know, [...] How do you know? ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You can {{calm down}} then, because you're not going. You're better at home <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>bed,</b> {{and as for}} that club concert, it's all nonsense, and little girls {{should not be allowed}} to go out to such places at all." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Good-night, my girl," [...] she said, {{with more}} {{gentleness}} than was her wont. [...] "Sleep {{well for the}} last time <b>in</b> <b>your</b> old <b>bed.</b> I doubt if to-morrow you'll get into it at all, and don't let the Pater stay too long and waste the candle." ...|$|R
60|$|MRS LUTESTRING. I do. When I {{think of}} the blessings that have been showered on you, and {{contrast}} them with the poverty! the humiliations! the anxieties! the heartbreak! the insolence and tyranny that were the daily lot of mankind when I was learning to suffer instead of learning to live! when I see how lightly you take it all! how you quarrel over the crumpled leaves <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>beds</b> of roses! how you are so dainty about your work that unless it is made either interesting or delightful to you you leave it to negresses and Chinamen, I ask myself whether even three hundred years of thought and experience can save you from being superseded by the Power that created you and put you on your trial.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear girl, {{we shall}} have you sick <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed,</b> unless you keep {{yourself}} warm and quiet for a few days. Widow Wadman {{can take care of}} the ward alone, now the men are so comfortable, and have her vacation when you are about again. Now do be prudent in time, and don't let me have to add a Periwinkle to my bouquet of patients." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Hide them <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed.</b> It {{will be a}} {{very dark}} night, and you must steal out and make your way {{to the middle of the}} south wall. There fling your grapnel up and scale the wall. I shall be there waiting for you. It looks as if it will be very wet as well as very dark, so you ought to be able to avoid the sentinel.” ...|$|E
60|$|ANDROCLES. Well, {{let us hope}} so, brother, {{for your}} sake. You've had a gay time, haven't you? with your raids on the temples. I can't help {{thinking}} that heaven will be very dull {{for a man of}} your temperament. (Spintho snarls). Don't be angry: I say it only to console you in case you should die <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>bed</b> tonight in the natural way. There's a lot of plague about.|$|E
6000|$|Low <b>in</b> <b>your</b> wintry <b>beds,</b> ye flowers, [...] Again ye'll {{flourish}} {{fresh and}} fair; [...] Ye birdies dumb, in with'ring bowers, [...] Again ye'll charm the vocal air.

6000|$|Almanz. If not {{a subject}} then, a ghost I'll be; And from a ghost, you know, no place is free. Asleep, awake, I'll haunt you every where; From my white shroud groan love into <b>your</b> ear: When <b>in</b> <b>your</b> lover's arms you sleep at night, I'll glide in cold betwixt, and seize my right: And is't not better, <b>in</b> <b>your</b> nuptial <b>bed,</b> To have a living lover than a dead? ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then,' said Good Mrs Brown, {{taking her}} own {{seat on the}} bones, 'don't vex me. If you don't, I tell you I won't hurt you. But if you do, I'll kill you. I could have you killed at any time--even if you was <b>in</b> <b>your</b> own <b>bed</b> at home. Now let's know who you are, and what you are, and all about it.' ...|$|R
