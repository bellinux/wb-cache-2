40|$|The {{absence of}} {{immunoglobulin}} (Ig) expression in B-cell derived Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells of classical Hodgkins disease, {{has been suggested}} {{to be caused by}} crippling mutations in the Ig coding region and more recently in the Ig promoter region. This study addressed the role of mutations in the Ig promoter region to prevent Ig expression in HRS cells. 335 single isolated Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells from nine cases of classical Hodgkins disease and four B-cell derived <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines, were analyzed for mutations in the TATA box and octamer motif of the Ig promoter. Furthermore, we investigated the octamer motif of the EÂµ-Enhancers exclusively in the <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines. The enhancer octamer motives and the TATA boxes were completely unaffected. Mutations of the promoter octamer motif were found in only one of nine cases and one of four <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines. We also demonstrated that analysis of the complete Ig coding region (FW 1 -JH) fails to detect more crippling mutations as previously described. This supports the view that crippling mutations in the Ig promoter, the Ig coding region, and/or both may not contribute in most cases to the lack of Ig gene expression in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells. To clarify whether or not the Ig gene transcription machinery might be defective in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells, we analyzed in the <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines, the important transcription factors Oct- 1, Oct- 2, and OCA-B at protein and m-RNA level. In contrast to controls, in all <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines either a complete lack or strong reduction in the expression of the Oct- 2 transcription factor and the OCA-B co- activator were found. The conclusions drawn from these results are that crippling mutations in the Ig gene promoter and coding region are not the sole cause for the lack of Ig expression in Hodgkin Reed-Sternberg cells. That defects of the transcription machinery such as absence of Oct- 2 /OCA-B are more important for this phenomenon in classical Hodgkins disease...|$|E

Concentrations of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) were at low levels in a portion of S cells that abundantly expressed FoxO 3 a, a transcription factor that regulates ROS-degrading enzymes. In clinical samples of HL, FoxO 3 a was expressed in mononuclear <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cells</b> but not in multinucleated RS cells.

40|$|AIM [...] To {{define the}} {{distribution}} of proliferating cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) and silver staining nucleolar organiser regions (AgNORs) in Hodgkin's disease. METHODS [...] PCNA was shown {{in a series of}} 34 cases of Hodgkin's disease using immunohistochemical methods. In a second series of 46 cases the AgNOR technique for interphase nucleolar organiser regions was studied. Both series comprised routinely fixed and processed paraffin wax sections of three main Rye subtypes.

Restin expression was studied by immunohistochemistry using polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies. Restin was not detected in normal tissues, a range of B- and T-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphomas, and nonlymphoid tumors. However, Restin was present in Reed-Sternberg cells and variants thereof in Hodgkin's disease, {{with the exception of the}} lymphocyte-predominant, paragranuloma subtype. Restin was also highly expressed in anaplastic large-cell lymphoma (so-called Ki- 1 lymphoma). As expected, Restin was also expressed in <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines L 428, L 428 KSA, Co, and KM-H 2 and the anaplastic large-cell lymphoma cell line Karpas 299, which was confirmed by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and Western blotting, as well as Northern blotting.

40|$|Classical Hodgkin lymphomas (cHLs) contain {{small numbers}} of {{neoplastic}} ReedâSternberg (RS) cells within an extensive inflammatory infiltrate that includes abundant T helper (Th) - 2 and T regulatory (Treg) cells. The skewed nature of the T cell infiltrate {{and the lack of}} an effective host antitumor immune response suggest that RS cells use potent mechanisms to evade immune attack. In a screen for T cell-inhibitory molecules in cHL, we found that RS cells selectively overexpressed the immunoregulatory glycan-binding protein, galectin- 1 (Gal 1), through an AP 1 -dependent enhancer. In cocultures of activated T cells and <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines, RNAi-mediated blockade of RS cell Gal 1 increased T cell viability and restored the Th 1 /Th 2 balance. In contrast, Gal 1 treatment of activated T cells favored the secretion of Th 2 cytokines and the expansion of CD 4 +CD 25 high FOXP 3 + Treg cells. These data directly implicate RS cell Gal 1 in the development and maintenance of an immunosuppressive Th 2 /Treg-skewed microenvironment in cHL and provide the molecular basis for selective Gal 1 expression in RS cells. Thus, Gal 1 represents a potential therapeutic target for restoring immune surveillance in cHL...|$|E

A small but significant percentage of patients, however, will respond poorly to therapy. A recent gene expression profiling study has identified a macrophage signature which has been correlated with primary treatment failure, and immunohistochemical tissue microarray for CD 68 was shown to reflect the gene signature as a potentially clinically useful marker to predict adverse prognosis. We examined 44 cases of CHL, mostly nodular sclerosis subtype, in which the immunohistochemical stains for the histiocytic markers CD 68 and CD 163 were performed. The staining intensity was graded for each stain ( 25 percent of cells positive in the <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> (HC) rich nodules) and background staining characteristics were recorded. CD 163 staining was lower than CD 68 in HC rich nodules, with lower background staining (p 0. 03). There {{was no significant difference}} between either CD 68 or CD 163 and disease recurrence in a subset (N = 41) of cases. In conclusion, we demonstrate that CD 163 staining is lower than CD 68, with less non-specific staining of background inflammatory cells and Hodgkin cells, therefore is a better marker for tumor associated macrophages. However, we did not identify a correlation between staining for CD 68 or CD 163 and recurrence of disease. Virtual slides: The virtual slide(s) for this article can be found here...|$|E
40|$|A {{proportion}} {{of patients with}} Hodgkin lymphoma carry Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), an oncogenic herpesvirus, in their tumor cells. Although it is generally assumed that EBV contributes to the malignant phenotype of <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cells,</b> direct {{evidence in support of}} this is lack-ing. Here we show that EBV infection of <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cells</b> results in the induction of autotaxin, a secreted tumor-associated factor with lysophospho-lipase-D activity. Up-regulation of auto-taxin increased the generation of lysophosphatidic acid (LPA) and led to the enhanced growth and survival of <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cells,</b> whereas spe-cific down-regulation of autotaxin de-creased LPA levels and reduced cell growth and viability. In lymphoma tis-sues, autotaxin expression was mainly restricted to CD 30 anaplastic large-cell lymphomas and Hodgkin lymphoma; in the latter, high levels of autotaxin were strongly associated with EBV positivity (P. 006).

The expression of the IL- 6 receptor (IL- 6 R) complex and its link to the activation of signal transducers and activators of transcription (STAT) molecules in HD cell lines was investigated. Gel retardation and Western blot analyses revealed a high level of constitutively activated STAT 3 in 5 of 7 HD cell lines, which could not be detected in Burkitt lymphoma cell lines. Different levels of IL- 6 R protein were measured in various HD cell lines: L 428 and Dev cells were characterized by very low levels of gp 80 and gp 130, on KMH 2 cells only gp 130 but no gp 80 was detected, whereas L 540, L 591, HDLM 2, and L 1236 were positive for both gp 80 and gp 130, suggesting a possible autocrine stimulation of STAT 3.

Sex-lethal is turned on only in females, and an autoregulatory feedback loop which controls alternative splicing maintains this state (L. R. Bell, J. I. Horabin, P. Schedl, and T. W.

Sex-lethal also promotes female differentiation by controlling the splicing of RNA from the next gene in the hierarchy, transformer. Sosnowski et al. (B. A. Sosnowski, J. M. Belote, and M.

40|$|Apoptosis is {{the central}} {{mechanism}} of cell death mediating the killing of malignant cells upon chemotherapy. Resistance of tumor cells against cytostatic drugs is frequent and this underlines the necessity to understand the underlying molecular events. That is the basis to develop strategies which are able to overcome these resistance mechanisms and to achieve susceptibility of tumor cells to cancer treatment. In the present study, TNF-alpha was characterized as a sensitizer of malignant hematological cells for cytostatic drug- and ceramide-induced apoptosis. The molecular mechanisms mediating this sensitizing effect were {{the focus of this}} study. The sensitizing effect of TNF-alpha and the implicated signaling pathways were investigated in the well characterized Hodgkin-derived cell line HD-MyZ. Despite the complete resistance of HD-MyZ cells to TNF-alpha itself, TNF-alpha sensitized for cell death triggered by etoposide, epirubicin and C 2 -ceramide. The expression of a dominant-negative I-kappa B-alpha (IkappaBdn) resulted in the disruption of the NF-kappa-signaling pathway and blocked the expression of the anti-apoptotic gene, hiap- 1. While HD-MyZ IkappaBdn cells were more sensitive for drug-induced apoptosis, the sensitizing effect of TNF-alpha was not effected upon blocking of the NF-kappa B-signaling. The sensitization by TNF-alpha led to a better activation of the mitochondrial apoptosome and the downstream caspase cascade, i. e. caspase- 3. Functional experiments showed that interconnecting signaling pathways which link the death receptor signaling to the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis are not the underlying mechanism in the cell line modell of HD-MyZ since no caspase- 8 or bid cleavage was observed. Furthermore, caspase- 8 inhibition could not prevent the sensitizing effect of TNF-alpha. Additionally, the activation of the sphingomyelin second messenger pathway as cause for the sensitizing by TNF-alpha was excluded. The sensitizing effect of TNF-alpha was not restricted to the <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> line HD-MyZ as TNF-alpha also augmented the drug-induced apoptosis of different chronic and acute leukemia-derived cell lines and the Burkitt-like lymphoma line BJAB.

PMBL patients were considerably younger than other DLBCL patients, and their lymphomas frequently involved other thoracic structures but not extrathoracic sites typical of other DLBCLs. PMBL patients had a relatively favorable clinical outcome, with a 5 -yr survival rate of 64 % compared with 46 % for other DLBCL patients. Gene expression profiling strongly supported a relationship between PMBL and Hodgkin lymphoma: over {{one third of the}} genes that were more highly expressed in PMBL than in other DLBCLs were also characteristically expressed in <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cells.</b> PDL 2, which encodes a regulator of T cell activation, was the gene that best discriminated PMBL from other DLBCLs and was also highly expressed in <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cells.</b> The genomic loci for PDL 2 and several neighboring genes were amplified in over half of the PMBLs and in <b>Hodgkin</b> lymphoma <b>cell</b> lines. The molecular diagnosis of PMBL should significantly aid in the development of therapies tailored to this clinically and pathogenetically distinctive subgroup of DLBCL...|$|R

40|$|NK {{cells are}} {{lymphocytes}} of the {{innate immune system}} and {{play a crucial role}} in tumor immune surveillance, in beneficial graft versus tumor effects upon hematopoietic stem cell transplantations (HSCT) and thereby as effectors in cellular immunotherapies. NK cells are regulated by inhibitory receptors mostly binding to HLA molecules and activating receptors like CD 16, NKG 2 D and NKp 30. Aim of this work was to contribute to the molecular understanding of the insufficient control of tumor cells through NK cells. This was examined on the basis of leukemic cell lines with myeloid or lymphatic origin, since these cells, according to their origin, are recognized and killed very differently by donor NK cells upon stem cell transplantation. In this study we could show that the cytotoxic receptor NKp 30 contributes decisively to a better lysis of myeloid leukemic cell lines compared to lymphatic leukemic cell lines. Thus, exosomes expressing ligands for NKp 30 can help to overcome the resistance of lymphatic leukemia cells against NK cell recognition and killing. Additionally an increased inhibitory signaling via HLA molecules on lymphatic cell lines prevents a more efficient lysis. Moreover, it was shown in the setting of Hodgkin lymphoma (HL) that patientsÂ´ NK cells in contrast to healthy NK cells are not able to lyse <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cell</b> lines. Soluble factors in the patientsÂ´ sera were identified to be responsible for that. Of note, patient sera also suppressed cytotoxic activity of NK cells from healthy donors by downregulation of activating receptors. Results indicate that the soluble ligands MICA for NKG 2 D and BAT 3 for NKp 30 play an important role. While these ligands trigger cytotoxicity in their membrane bound form, as soluble factors they have inhibitory impact and can downregulate NK cell receptors. Indeed, NK cell derived from HL patients showed a lower expression level of NKG 2 D than healthy NK cells. After therapy and clearance of the tumor, serum levels of these soluble ligands were comparable to healthy donors again. Furthermore, NK cells in HL patients were successfully reactivated in vivo and ex vivo with a bispecific antibody construct. This construct stimulated NK cells via CD 16 and binds CD 30 as an antigen on target cells. Thereby, a very efficient lysis of Hodgkin target cells was achieved in experiments. Taken together, the data indicate that the increased expression of tumor associated ligands for NKG 2 D and NKp 30 in the serum of HL patients influences the phenotype and the function of HL NK cells and hence contributes to a tumor immune evasion. However, the inhibition of NK cells is reversible and can be overcome with therapeutical bispecific antibodies. Thus, NK cells seem to be a promising approach for cellular based immunotherapies as an alternative to standard therapies...|$|E

40|$|The {{hallmark}} of classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) {{is the presence}} of giant, mostly multinucleated Hodgkin-Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells. Whereas it has recently been shown that giant HRS cells evolve from small <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cells</b> by incomplete cytokinesis and re-fusion of tethered sister cells, it remains unsolved why this phenomenon particularly takes place in this lymphoma and what the differences between these cell types of variable sizes are. The aim {{of the present study was}} to characterize microdissected small and giant HRS cells by gene expression profiling and to assess differences of clonal growth behavior as well as susceptibility toward cytotoxic intervention between these different cell types to provide more insight into their distinct cellular potential. Applying stringent filter criteria, only two differentially expressed genes between small and giant HRS cells, SHFM 1 and LDHB, were identified. With looser filter criteria, 13 genes were identified to be differentially overexpressed in small compared to giant HRS cells. These were mainly related to energy metabolism and protein synthesis, further suggesting that small <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cells</b> resemble the proliferative compartment of cHL. SHFM 1, which is known to be involved in the generation of giant cells, was downregulated in giant RS cells at the RNA level. However, reduced mRNA levels of SHFM 1, LDHB and HSPA 8 did not translate into decreased protein levels in giant HRS cells. In cell culture experiments it was observed that the fraction of small and big HRS cells was adjusted to the basic level several days after enrichment of these populations via cell sorting, indicating that small and big HRS cells can reconstitute the full spectrum of cells usually observed in the culture. However, assessment of clonal growth of HRS cells indicated a significantly reduced potential of big HRS cells to form single cell colonies. Taken together, our findings pinpoint to strong similarities but also some differences between small and big HRS cells...|$|R

40|$|Diagnosis of Hodgkin {{lymphoma}} (HL) by fine-needle aspiration (FNA) {{is often}} hampered by aspirated blood that camouflage scattered <b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cells</b> and Reed-Sternberg (HRS) cells, {{and the absence}} of HRS cells in the smears submitted for immunopheno-typing. The objective {{of this study was to}} develop a simple protocol to overcome these problems. The visibility of HRS cells in Diff-Quik, traditional, and Ultrafast Papanicolaou (UFP) stains in FNA smears were compared in 73 cases of HL. HRS cells were found to be most visible in UFP because of the hemolysis of aspirated blood and the highlighting of HRS cells by the red-staining nucleoli. UFP-stained smears containing HRS cells were subsequently immunophenotyped via the cell-transfer technique. UFP staining was found to have no deleterious effect on the immunoreactivity of cellular CD 15 and CD 30 antigens of HRS cells. This simple protocol enhances the cytologic diagnosis of HL...|$|R
40|$|The p 53 {{tumor-suppressor gene}} encodes a nuclear phosphoprotein that arrests cell cycle {{progress}} at G 1. It may facilitate DNA damage repair and is frequently mutated in many human tumors. Hodgkin disease, a malignant {{condition of the}} lymphoid system, {{is characterized by the}} presence of Reed-Sternberg cells and mononuclear variants (<b>Hodgkin</b> <b>cells),</b> whose etiology remains unknown. The large multinucleated Reed-Sternberg cells often comprise < 1 % of the total cell population within a biopsy specimen and are thought to be the neoplastic component in an admixture of reactive cells. It has been shown in the large majority of cases that up to 60 % of these multinucleated cells react with CM- 1, an anti-p 53 antibody. However, whether this "overexpression" of p 53 protein reflects abnormality at the DNA level can no longer be assumed by immunocytochemistry alone. p 53 from six <b>Hodgkin</b> disease-derived <b>cell</b> lines was examined by immunoprecipitation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) -single-strand conformation polymorphism analysis, and sequencing. In one cell line, point mutations were identified in exons 5 and 8 of p 53. Sequencing of cloned PCR products confirmed the mutations to be on different alleles. A strategy involving extraction of nuclei followed by enrichment by flow cytometry was used to determine whether p 53 overexpression in the Reed-Sternberg cells from patient biopsy material was due to mutations in this gene. Single-strand conformation polymorphism revealed additional bands in the polyploid nuclear preparations, suggesting abnormalities, and sequence analysis confirmed the presence of point mutations...|$|R
