The current application icon in the upper right-hand corner of the menu bar cycles between open applications; {{it is not a}} menu. System 6 supports 24bits of addressable random access memory (RAM), which allowed a maximum of 8megabytes of RAM with no provision for virtual memory. These limitations were fixed in System 7. The version of the HFS used by System 6 also has a hard <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> limit; it supports up to 2gigabytes (GBs) and 65,536 files on a drive.

25|$|Steve Jobs {{introduced}} the first MacBook Air during {{a speech at}} his keynote at the 2008 Macworld conference on January 15, 2008. The first-generation MacBook Air was a 13.3"-only model, initially promoted as the world's thinnest notebook. It featured a custom Intel Merom CPU and Intel GMA graphics. In late 2008, the CPU was updated to a faster, non-custom Penryn CPU and integrated Nvidia GeForce graphics while the hard <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased and the micro-DVI video port {{was replaced by the}} Mini DisplayPort. A mid-2009 refresh, introduced alongside the MacBook Pro family, featured a slightly higher-capacity battery, and a faster Penryn CPU.|$|E
500|$|Apple {{refreshed}} {{the entire}} MacBook Pro line on October 24, 2006 to include Intel Core 2 Duo processors. Memory capacity was doubled for each model, to 1GB on the low-end 15-inch and 2GB for the high-end 15- and 17-inch models. FireWire 800 {{was added to}} the 15-inch models. Hard <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> was increased, although video card options stayed the same. The MacBook Pro line received a second update on June 5, 2007 with new Nvidia Geforce 8600M GT video cards and faster processor options. LED backlighting {{was added to the}} 15-inch model's screen, and its weight was reduced from [...] to [...] Furthermore, the speed of the front-side bus was increased from 667MHz to 800MHz. On November 1, 2007, Apple added the option of a 2.6GHz Santa Rosa platform Core 2 Duo CPU as well as reconfigured hard drive options.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{personal}} computing era, {{one source of}} consumer confusion is {{the difference in the}} way many operating systems display hard drive sizes, compared to the way hard drive manufacturers describe them. Hard drives are specified and sold using [...] "GB" [...] and [...] "TB" [...] in their decimal meaning: one billion and one trillion bytes. Many operating systems and other software, however, display hard drive and file sizes using [...] "MB", [...] "GB" [...] or other SI-looking prefixes in their binary sense, just as they do for displays of RAM capacity. For example, many such systems display a hard drive marketed as [...] "160GB" [...] as [...] "149.05GB". The earliest known presentation of hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> by an operating system using [...] "KB" [...] or [...] "MB" [...] in a binary sense is 1984; earlier operating systems generally presented the hard disk <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> as an exact number of bytes, with no prefix of any sort, for example, in the output of the MS-DOS or PCDOS CHKDSK command.|$|E
25|$|OSR2, OSR2.1 and OSR2.5 {{were not}} {{released}} to the general public; rather, they were available only to OEMs that would preload the OS onto computers.

5|$|The Mac Pro also {{supported}} Serial ATA solid-state drives (SSD) in the 4 hard drive bays via an SSD-to-hard drive sled adapter (mid-2010 models and later), and by third-party solutions for earlier models (e.g., by an adapter/bracket which plugged into an unused PCIe slot). Various 2.5-inch SSD <b>drive</b> <b>capacities</b> and configurations were available as options.|$|R
2500|$|The total {{capacity}} of HDDs {{is given by}} manufacturers using SI decimal prefixes such as gigabytes (1GB= 1,000,000,000bytes) and terabytes (1TB= 1,000,000,000,000bytes). This practice {{dates back to the}} early days of computing; by the 1970s, [...] "million", [...] "mega" [...] and [...] "M" [...] were consistently used in the decimal sense for <b>drive</b> <b>capacity.</b> However, capacities of memory [...] are quoted using a binary interpretation of the prefixes, i.e. using powers of 1024 instead of 1000.|$|E
2500|$|Any {{block size}} could be {{specified}} {{up to the}} maximum track length. [...] Since the block headers occupied space, the usable capacity of the drive was dependent on the block size. [...] Blocks ("records" [...] in IBM's terminology) of 88, 96, 880 and 960 were often used because they related to the fixed block size of 80- and 96-character punch cards. The <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> was usually stated under conditions of full track record blocking. For example, the 100-megabyte 3336 disk pack only achieved that capacity with a full track block size of 13,030 bytes.|$|E
2500|$|Today, {{the hard}} drive {{industry}} continues to use decimal prefixes for <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> (as well as for transfer rate). For example, a [...] "300GB" [...] hard drive offers slightly more than 300Ã—109, or , bytes, not [...] (which would be about [...] ). [...] Operating systems such as Microsoft Windows that display hard drive sizes using the customary binary prefix [...] "GB" [...] (as it is used for RAM) would display this as [...] "279.4GB" [...] (meaning [...] bytes, or [...] ). On the other hand, Mac OS X has since version 10.6 shown hard drive size using decimal prefixes (thus matching the drive makers' packaging). (Previous versions of Mac OS used binary prefixes.) ...|$|E

2500|$|USB flash drives {{are often}} used for the same {{purposes}} for which floppy disks or CDs were once used; i.e. for storage, data back-up and transfer of computer files. They are smaller, faster, have thousands of times more capacity, and are more durable and reliable {{because they have no}} moving parts. [...] Additionally, they are immune to electromagnetic interference (unlike floppy disks), and are unharmed by surface scratches (unlike CDs). Until about 2005, most desktop and laptop computers were supplied with floppy disk drives in addition to USB ports, but floppy disk drives have become obsolete after widespread adoption of USB ports and the larger USB <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> compared to the 1.44MB 3.5-inch floppy disk.|$|E
2500|$|The {{factor of}} 306 {{cylinders}} (rather than 256 or 512, {{both of which}} are powers of two) in the calculation causes the capacity to be not conveniently close to a power of 1024; operating systems and programs using the customary binary prefixes show this as [...] "9.5625MB". Many later drives in the personal computer market used 17 sectors per track; still later, zone bit recording was introduced, causing the number of sectors per track to vary from the outer track to the inner. Nor are drives required to have a number of active surfaces that is a power of, or even divisible by, two; drives with e.g. three active surfaces are not uncommon. All of these factors reduce the utility of the customary binary prefixes for expressing <b>drive</b> <b>capacity.</b>|$|E
2500|$|On October 5, 1999, Apple {{discontinued}} the tray-loading iMac. The new iMac {{built upon}} the Revision D's success with a faster processor, double the RAM, {{improvements to the}} built-in speaker system, a slot-loading optical drive, faster ATI Rage 128 VR graphics, a slightly updated case, and support for Apple's 802.11b AirPort wireless networking card. [...] The iMac was joined by two additional standard configurations, the iMac DV ("digital video") and iMac DV Special Edition. Designed to support home movie editing, the iMac DV had a more powerful processor, a VGA-out port, DVD-ROM drive, larger hard drive, and two FireWire ports for US$1299, in new shades of all five Revision D colors. The iMac DV Special Edition doubled the RAM again and increased hard <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> to 13 GB at US$1499, and was available in an exclusive Graphite color. All iMac (slot-loading) models featured convection cooling, keeping them nearly silent during operation.|$|E

5000|$|While {{the disk}} buffer, {{which is an}} {{integrated}} part of the hard disk drive, is sometimes misleadingly referred to as [...] "disk cache", its main functions are write sequencing and read prefetching.

Hard <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> increased and a faster processor was added. The Bondi Blue color was discontinued and replaced by five new colors: Strawberry, Blueberry, Lime, Grape, and Tangerine. A final update, Revision D, was released on April 14, 1999, which maintained its previous specifications save a faster processor.|$|E
2500|$|The Macintosh {{contained}} a single 400KB, single-sided 3.5-inch floppy disk drive, dedicating no space to other internal mechanical storage. The Mac OS was disk-based from the beginning, as RAM {{had to be}} conserved, but this [...] "Startup Disk" [...] could still be temporarily ejected. (Ejecting the root filesystem remained an unusual feature of the classic Mac OS until System 7.) One floppy disk was sufficient to store the System Software, an application and the data files created with the application. Indeed, the 400KB <b>drive</b> <b>capacity</b> was larger than the PC XT's 360KB 5.25-inch drive. However, more sophisticated work environments of the time required separate disks for documents and the system installation. Due to the memory constraints (128 KB) of the original Macintosh, {{and the fact that}} the floppies could hold 400 KB, users frequently had to swap disks in and out of the floppy drive. [...] For this reason, external floppy drives were frequently used. [...] The Macintosh External Disk Drive (mechanically identical to the internal one, piggybacking on the same controller) was a popular add-on at US $495. Third-party hard drives were considerably more expensive and usually connected to the slower serial port (as specified by Apple), though a few manufacturers chose to use the faster non-standard floppy port. The 128K can only use the original Macintosh File System for storage.|$|E
