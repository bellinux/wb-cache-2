50|$|An {{interesting}} {{characteristic of}} commercially made ice cubes {{is that they}} are completely clear, lacking the clouding found in the center of domestically made ice cubes. Cloudy ice cubes result when water is frozen quickly, or when the water is high in dissolved solids. When water is cooled to its freezing point, and ice starts to form, dissolved gases can no longer stay in solution and come out as microscopic bubbles. However, as ice floats in water, once there is enough ice to form a layer on the surface, the ice layer traps all bubbles within the ice cube. Commercial <b>ice-makers</b> use a flowing source of purified water to make ice with cooling elements at the bottom, allowing the bubbles to be washed away from the top as the cube grows.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the reliability and}} performance of the Chorreras photovoltaic (PV) hybrid ice-making system. The system is unique and is located near the fishing village of Chorreras, Chihuahua in northern Mexico. Information gathered from field visits and a continuous monitoring data acquisition system are reviewed to discuss system design and operation. The system has been working producing ice {{on a daily basis}} with occasional control problems and water line calcification that sometimes reduces ice production. The hybrid system provides a daily average of 8. 9 kWh at 240 volts to the <b>ice-maker.</b> The system Coefficient of Performance (COP) is about 0. 65 and a total of 97 percent of the energy has been supplied by the PV array, while only 3 percent has been supplied by the back-up propane-fueled generator. Production of ice varies slightly each month due to changes in insolation and ambient temperatures. Overall ice production fluctuates from 25 to 75 kg of ice per day depending on water line conditions. The actual load control of the <b>ice-maker</b> is a simple feed-forward control. With a fixed timer setting, the <b>ice-maker</b> is operated daily for about 3 hours except for Sunday. This {{is based on the assumption}} that the need of ice is the same every day and that at least the weekly PV energy generation covers the consumption of the <b>ice-maker.</b> By consideration of additional states of the system a more efficient automatic load control could be designed.

2500|$|In 1842 John Gorrie {{created a}} system capable of {{refrigerating}} water to produce ice.

[...] During the Civil War, cities such as New Orleans could no longer get ice from New England via the coastal ice trade. [...] Carre’s refrigeration system became the solution to New Orleans ice problems and by 1865 the city had three of Carre’s machines. [...] In 1867, in San Antonio, Texas, a French immigrant named Andrew Muhl built an ice-making machine to help service the expanding beef industry before moving it to Waco in 1871.

5000|$|The hotel {{stretched}} 680 ft {{along the}} Miami River's north bank. A verandah surrounded the hotel, about one-sixth {{of a mile}} in length. The hotel was described as [...] "modern Colonial", {{with an air of}} [...] "decorous opulence". There were 450 guest rooms and suites. The average guest room was twelve feet by eighteen feet, and 100 of the rooms had private baths. The main dining room would seat 500 guests. A second dining room was for maids and children. There were also private dining rooms. There were parlors, a billiards room, other game rooms, a 45 ft by 50 ft ballroom, and 100 dressing rooms at the swimming pool. The boiler room, electric plant, kitchens, laundry and <b>ice-makers</b> were in a separate building. The hotel had a staff of 300, including sixteen cooks.

5000|$|This rule, a {{relatively}} recent addition to curling, was added {{in response to a}} strategy of [...] "peeling" [...] opponents' guard stones (knocking them out of play at an angle that caused the shooter's stone to also roll out of play, leaving no stones on the ice). A team in the lead would often employ this strategy during the game. By knocking all stones out, the opponents could at best score one point (if they had the hammer). Alternatively, the team with the hammer could peel rock after rock, which would blank the end, keeping the last rock advantage for another end. This strategy had developed (mostly in Canada) as <b>ice-makers</b> had become skilled at creating a predictable ice surface and the adoption of brushes allowed greater control over the rock. While a sound strategy, this made for an unexciting game. Observers at the time noted that if two teams equally skilled in the peel game faced each other on good ice, the outcome of the game would be predictable from who won the coin flip to have last rock (or had earned it in the schedule) {{at the beginning of the}} game. The 1990 Brier was considered by many curling fans as boring to watch because of the amount of peeling and the quick adoption of the Free Guard Zone the following year reflected how disliked this aspect of the game had become.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 Water-source and <b>ice-maker</b> {{heat pumps}} share many characteristics. However, each {{presents}} different technical difficulties that have {{prevented them from}} being used more widely. In a water-source heat pump a very important consideration is to reduce water consumption, while in an <b>ice-maker</b> heat pump a major concern {{is to reduce the}} number of deicing cycles while keeping a high performance. Previous research by this author has indicated that the use of the flow reversal method (reversing periodically the water flow direction in the evaporator) has the effect of partly deicing the evaporator, reducing pressure drop and enhancing heat transfer. This thesis shows the development and application of analytical and numerical models to study the effect of different evaporator parameters on heat pump efficiency, as well as the possible advantages of using the flow reversal method in a water-source or <b>ice-maker</b> heat pump. The conclusion reached from these studies is that periodic water flow reversals inside an evaporator with freezing help improve the performance of a heat pump system in two different ways. First, periodic water flow direction reversals serve to enhance heat transfer in the evaporator. Second, reversing the water flow direction also delays ice blockage in the evaporator, or totally prevents blockage from happening. Delaying ice blockage represents a substantial improvement for <b>ice-maker</b> heat pumps, since these may then operate for a longer time without deicing. Preventing ice blockage represents a substantial improvement for water-source heat pumps, since these may then operate at lower water flow rates. Suggestions for future work include further testing of the flow reversal method for different evaporator geometries, as well as an experimental evaluation of the flow reversal method...|$|E
40|$|We have {{developed}} a computational model which allows the simulation of a thermoelectric device to make ice cubes in a vapor compression domestic fridge. This model solves both the thermoelectric and heat transfer equations, including the phase change equations in the ice cube production. The inputs of the model are: the thermoelectric parameters {{as a function of}} the temperature; dimensions; material properties (thermal resistances and capacities) and the boundary conditions (room temperature and voltage supplied to the Peltier module). The outputs are the values of the temperature for all the elements of the thermoelectric <b>ice-maker</b> and the ice production. In the experimental phase a prototype of a thermoelectric ice maker incorporated in a vapour compression domestic fridge was constructed in order to adjust and validate the computational model, and to optimize the experimental application. This <b>ice-maker</b> has two Peltier modules, some aluminum cylinders, called fingers, where the ice is made, and a component that acts as heat extender and dissipater which connects the hot side of Peltier module with the freezer compartment. The ice formation on the fingers is obtained by the cooling on the Peltier modules. When the ice cubes are formed, the voltage polarity of the thermoelectric modules is switched so the fingers warm up until the ice around the fingers melts. Then the ice cubes are dropped by gravity. This paper studies the production of ice cubes using the computational model and the experiment results and analyzes the most important parameters for the optimisation of the <b>ice-maker</b> (voltage supplied to the Peltier module, thermal resistance of the hot side dissipater and initial water temperature) ...|$|E

40|$|International {{environment}} protection initiatives {{have led to}} the intensification of research efforts on development of ozone and global warming safe heat pump technology. Adsorption refrigeration has been intensively investigated in Japan, Europe and USA, because of its promising potential for competing with conventional vapor compression refrigeration. During the last decade, a lot of work has been carried out in this field, {{with a certain amount of}} success. To reach a truly practical / applicable and cost effective solar refrigeration technology, some key innovation work must be completed. With the progress in the fields of the adsorbent material production and solar energy collecting technology, there is a real possibility to achieve commercialization of such systems. This paper presents the decription and operation of a solar-powered <b>ice-maker</b> with solid adsorption pair of activated carbon and methanol. A domestic type of charcoal is chosen as the adsorbent, and a simple flat-plate collector with an exposed area of 0. 92 m 2 is employed to produce ice of about 4 - 5 kg/day. Also, it is intended to introduce a hybrid system consisting of solar water heater and <b>ice-maker,</b> which can satisfy the requirements of both the solar ice-making needs as well as good heat collection and heat release in the adsorber. It is expected that by introducing such method using the newly developed ACF, the total efficiency of the system can be increased by about 30 %. This idea is simple and also expected to be effective, since, the hybrid system of solar powered water heater and refrigerator will be able to satisfy both heating and cooling needs, thereby increasing the total efficiency of the system. Although this device is designed just for solar energy utilization, it can be applied to many energy saving fields such as waste heat recovery in industry, and in the exhaust gas-driven air conditioning. Such a novel concept of energy utilization would also contribute to more efficient methods for sustainable development...|$|E

40|$|Industrial {{refrigeration}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} energy consuming sector in the world today. In a world where electrical energy cost is increasing exponentially, the need for a refrigeration system that utilises minimal amount of energy becomes paramount. The solution lies in adsorption refrigeration system which is powered by heat energy from the sun. It is in this light, that a model to carry out the analysis of Activated carbon/Methanol pair for an adsorption <b>ice-maker</b> has been developed. Which will also help to determine the efficieny of the system using this same pair. The design calculations were carried out using mathematical analysis which was obtained by means of weight and energy balance in addition to the relations between temperature, pressure, concentration and enthalpy of the working fluids (refrigerant and the adsorbent) and the energy source (Solar energy). For the fabrication of the system, quality seamless copper tubing (of BS EN 1057) was used for the pipe network. For this pipe network, series of 40 mm and 30 mm pipes were placed concentrically while their ends were welded together to form the reactor section and 25. 4 mm tubes were considered for the condenser and evaporator section. Perplex sheet and fibre glass were used for the evaporator compartment, flat plate solar collector for collection of the required heat energy, while the condenser tube was designed to be water-cooled in a concrete compartment.

40|$|Graduation date: 1987 The {{problems}} of freezing and melting present special mathematical complexity and, {{except for the}} most elementary one-dimensional cases, require a numerical solution. However, these problems have a growing importance in engineering problems because of their application to metallurgical operations, food preservation, heating and air conditioning, etc. In the present work, a numerical model for ice formation from flowing water in a finned annular sector is developed. The model predicts ice profiles {{as a function of}} axial position and time, and energy transfer values as a function of time. The model also allows flow direction reversals in the annular sector. The flow reversal melts part of the ice existing in the annulus. Also, part of the ice detaches, allowing it to flow out with the liquid water. This enhances the energy transfer values. The model uses an arbitrary criterion for melting and detaching. The model is used for a preliminary evaluation of an <b>ice-maker</b> heat pump evaporator operating with flow reversal. Flow reversal de-ices the evaporator surfaces and enhances the heat transfer. Therefore, the flow reversal method is suggested as an alternative for de-icing without the losses commonly associated with the methods currently used to accomplish this. The results of the preliminary evaporator evaluation show a large energy transfer gain for the reversal case, as compared to the energy transfer obtained without reversal. Most of the gain comes from an increased cooling of the liquid water (more sensible energy from the water is being transferred to the refrigerant). The model predicts only a small amount of ice detachment from the evaporator. Further study in this area is recommended for completing the evaluation of the evaporator. A better ice melting-detaching criterion and a more complete parametric evaluation of the evaporator are required...|$|E
