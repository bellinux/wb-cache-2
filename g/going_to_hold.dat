5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres {{paid attention to the}} Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold.</b> The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain in the area of Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E

In 2014, WADL owner Kevin Adell announced he would participate in the auction, since it was estimated the station would net somewhere in the range of $170 million, much more than it would be worth on the open market otherwise. Since that time the auction estimate has increased to somewhere between $360–$380 million, with the auction currently scheduled to take place in early 2016.|$|E
25|$|Ever since Fahrenheit's {{meteoric}} rise to stardom, HIM {{has been}} giving quite a bit exposure for Fahrenheit, such as promoting the group in two of S.H.E's major concerts in Taipei, Singapore and Malaysia where they were seen performing their duet with Hebe {{as well as their}} own songs. Ever since their exposure had hit the Hong Kong market their company does not want to miss this chance for more promotion for the group and is currently organizing Fahrenheit's first major concert in Hong Kong in September at the HKCEC. It was reported that they are originally <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> a concert in Hong Kong's renowned coliseum, Hong Kong Coliseum, but because all of the performances slots are full, they have to move their concert to a different venue. The director of WOW Music expressed that Fahrenheit is currently slated for performing in the HKCEC for two to three nights. In the winter of 2008 they will debut in the Hong Kong Coliseum. as part of their All-Asia Concert. During their All-Asia press conference for the release of their second album in Hong Kong, it was revealed that plans for the All-Asia Concert were in the works.

500|$|A notable {{minority}} of Patton's officers were unimpressed or displeased with their commander's use of obscenities, viewing it as unprofessional conduct {{for a military}} officer.

At least one account replaced [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the enemy by the balls" [...] with [...] "We're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> the enemy by the nose." [...] Among the critics of Patton's frequent use of vulgarities was General Omar Bradley, Patton's former subordinate. It was well known {{that the two men}} were polar opposites in personality, and there is considerable evidence that Bradley disliked Patton both personally and professionally. In response to criticisms of his coarse language, Patton wrote to a family member, [...] "When I want my men to remember something important, to really make it stick, I give it to them double dirty. It may not sound nice to a bunch of little old ladies, at an afternoon tea party, but it helps my soldiers to remember.

Acknowledging the clichés in the pre-chorus, Michael Cragg remarked that they [...] "somehow sound enriching".

500|$|The French {{electronic}} group Daft Punk {{composed the}} film score of Tron: Legacy, which features over 30 tracks. The score was arranged and orchestrated by Joseph Trapanese.

An electronic music fan, Kosinski stated that to replicate the innovative electronic Tron score by Wendy Carlos [...] "rather than going with a traditional film composer, I wanted to try something fresh and different", adding that [...] "there {{was a lot of}} interest from different electronic bands that I follow to work on the film" [...] but he eventually picked Daft Punk. Kosinski added that he knew the band was [...] "more than just dance music guys" [...] for side projects such as [...] their film Electroma. The duo were first contacted by producers in 2007, when Tron: Legacy was still {{in the early stages of}} production. Since they were touring at the time, producers were unsuccessful in contacting the group. They were again approached by Kosinski, eventually agreeing to take part in the film a year later. Kosinski added that Daft Punk were huge Tron fans, and that his meeting with them [...] "was almost like they were interviewing me to make sure that I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> up to the Tron legacy".|$|E

2500|$|In 640, after {{a number}} of years during which Qu Wentai, {{initially}} submissive to Tang, became hostile to Tang interests and had allied himself with Western Tujue, Emperor Taizong sent Hou Junji to conquer Gaochang.

[...] Wei advised that Emperor Taizong should keep Qu on the throne, as an ally—a suggestion that Chu Suiliang also spoke of—but Emperor Taizong disagreed and annexed Gaochang directly. [...] (Emperor Taizong would later regret this in 642, when the need to station soldiers at Gaochang became more and more expensive in monetary and human costs.)

2500|$|In Florida, State Representative Joe Negron {{was picked}} to fill Foley's {{spot in the}} November elections. The Democratic nominee for the seat was Tim Mahoney. Florida law {{prohibited}} Foley's name from being removed from the ballot {{at the time of}} his withdrawal from the race, but Republicans hoped that voters would recognize that a vote for Foley would transfer to Negron as a substitute candidate. [...] Nevertheless, Boehner noted that because of the procedures in Florida, [...] "to vote for this candidate, you have to vote for Mark Foley. How many people are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> their nose to do that?" [...] Negron used the slogan, [...] "Punch Foley for Joe", having the double meaning of officially voting for Foley in order to really elect Negron as well as evoking images of physically striking the offending member of Congress. Foley's Republican-held seat was regarded as unlikely to change hands before the scandal broke, but CQPolitics changed its rating of the race from Safe Republican where it had stood since July to Leans Democratic in early-October. On Election Day, Mahoney won the seat.|$|E

The steward brought Simeon out to them, brought them into Joseph's house, gave them water, and fed their donkeys. When Joseph came home, they brought their present and bowed down to him. Joseph asked after their welfare and that of their father. They said that Joseph's servant their father was well, and they bowed their heads.

2500|$|The {{production}} {{was not without}} its lucky accidents: The company had just finished shooting the final segment of the sequence where Phyllis and Walter make their getaway after dumping their victim's body on the tracks. The crew was breaking for lunch before striking the set. In the script, the pair get in their car and simply drive away. But as Wilder got into his own car to leave, it wouldn't start. Inspired, he ran back and ordered the crew back. Wilder reshot the scene, only this time as Phyllis starts the car, the motor stalls and won't turn over. She tries several more times, but the car won't start and the two {{look at each other}} in growing panic. Walter desperately reaches over, turns the key and guns the motor, finally starting the car. Only then do they speed away from the crime scene. The result {{was one of the most}} suspenseful scenes in the film, but was not in the original script. MacMurray was surprised when he first saw it onscreen: [...] "...When I... turned the key I remember I was doing it fast and Billy kept saying, 'Make it longer, make it longer,' and finally I yelled, 'For Chrissake Billy, it's not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> that long,' and he said, 'Make it longer,' and he was right." ...|$|E
2500|$|With Prisoner of Azkaban, {{production}} of the Harry Potter films switched to an eighteen-month cycle, which producer David Heyman explained was [...] "to give each [...] the time it required." [...] Chris Columbus, {{the director of the}} previous two films, decided not to return to helm the third instalment as he [...] "hadn't seen [...] own kids for supper in the week for {{about two and a half}} years." [...] Even so, he remained on as a producer alongside Heyman. Guillermo del Toro was approached to direct, but considered the film [...] "so bright and happy and full of light, that [...] wasn't interested." [...] Marc Forster turned down the film because he had made Finding Neverland and did not want to direct child actors again. M. Night Shyamalan was considered to direct but turned it down because he was working on his own film, The Village. Warner Bros. then composed a three-name short list for Columbus's replacement, which comprised Callie Khouri, Kenneth Branagh (who played Gilderoy Lockhart in Chamber of Secrets) and eventual selection Alfonso Cuarón. Cuarón was initially nervous about accepting as he had not read any of the books, or seen the films. After reading the series, he changed his mind and signed on to direct, as he had immediately connected to the story. Cuarón's appointment pleased J. K. Rowling who loved his film Y Tu Mamá También and was impressed with his adaptation of A Little Princess. Heyman found that [...] "tonally and stylistically, [...] was the perfect fit." [...] As his first exercise with the actors who portray the central trio, Cuarón assigned Radcliffe, Grint and Watson to write an autobiographical essay about their character, written in the first person, spanning birth to the discovery of the magical world, and including the character's emotional experience. Of Rupert Grint's essay, Cuarón recalls, [...] "Rupert didn't deliver the essay. When I questioned why he didn't do it, he said, 'I'm Ron; Ron wouldn't do it.' So I said, 'Okay, you do understand your character.' That was the most important piece of acting work that we did on Prisoner of Azkaban, because it was very clear that everything they put in those essays was going to be the pillars they were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>hold</b> on to for the rest of the process." ...|$|E
