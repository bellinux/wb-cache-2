5|$|During {{the setting}} {{up of the}} <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service</b> (EEAS), Parliament used its control over the EU budget to {{influence}} {{the shape of the}} EEAS. MEPs had aimed at getting greater oversight over the EEAS by linking it to the Commission and having political deputies to the High Representative. MEPs didn't manage to get everything they demanded. However, they got broader financial control over the new body.|$|E
5|$|The Parliament is also {{responsible}} for discharging the implementation of previous budgets based on the annual report of the European Court of Auditors. It has refused to approve the budget only twice, in 1984 and in 1998. On the latter occasion {{it led to the}} resignation of the Santer Commission; highlighting how the budgetary power gives Parliament a great deal of power over the Commission. Parliament also makes extensive use of its budgetary, and other powers, elsewhere; for example in the setting up of the <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service,</b> Parliament has a de facto veto over its design as it has to approve the budgetary and staff changes.|$|E

40|$|Europe {{has never}} had a {{comprehensive}} approach towards the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) and the Arab Awakening has not significantly altered the calculations behind the existing policy fragmentation. Despite framing political and economic relations with MENA through collective diplo- matic frameworks, either multilateral (such as the 1995 Barcelona process) or bilateral (as the European Neighbourhood Policy), the Union has never developed a fully-fledged strategy of engagement with the region, but it has fostered partially complementary and partially mutually exclusive policy goals (such as the simultaneous promotion of democracy and security). The lack of a comprehensive vision is a consequence of at least three factors: the persis- tence of political and economic post-colonial interests by many big European states, the weakness of the <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Actions</b> <b>Service,</b> -still not fully operational and under- staffed- and the lack of leadership at the European level able to offer strategies if not grand visions of what Europe could and should become for its neighbourhood, and viceversa...|$|R
25|$|The EU's European Commission {{describes}} its peacebuilding {{activities as}} conflict prevention and management, and rehabilitation and reconstruction. Conflict prevention and management entails stopping the imminent {{outbreak of violence}} and encouraging a broad peace process. Rehabilitation and reconstruction deals with rebuilding the local economy and institutional capacity. The European Commission Conflict Prevention and Peace building 2001-2010 was subjected to a major external evaluation conducted by Aide a la Decisions Economique (ADE) with the European Centre for Development Policy Management which was presented in 2011. The <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service</b> created in 2010 also has a specific Division of Conflict Prevention, Peacebuilding and Mediation.|$|E

The High Representative heads up the <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service</b> (EEAS), a unique EU department that has been officially implemented and operational since 1 December 2010 {{on the occasion of the}} first anniversary of the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon.

25|$|As part of {{the process}} of {{establishment}} of the <b>European</b> <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service</b> envisioned in the Lisbon Treaty, on 1 January 2010 all former European Commission delegations were renamed European Union delegations and till the end of the month 54 of the missions (marked with † in the list of diplomatic missions) were transformed into embassy-type missions that employ greater powers than the regular delegations. These upgraded delegations have taken on the role previously carried out by the national embassies of the member state holding the rotating Presidency of the Council of the European Union and merged with the independent Council delegations around the world. Through this the EU delegations take on the role of co-ordinating national embassies and speaking for the EU as a whole, not just the Commission.|$|E

Reforming the security sector is a crucial element of the international community's efforts to rebuild Afghanistan. Decades of armed conflict in the country had left the Afghan National Police (ANP) with multiple challenges - the ANP is {{at the forefront of the}} fight against the insurgency and consequently often suffers heavy casualties.

Previously to the Lisbon Treaty, the EU was represented abroad by the Ambassador of the country holding the semestral EU presidency, and the European Commission was represented by a Head of Delegation of the European Commission, member of the diplomatic corps and given the title of ambassador as a courtesy.Since 2010, the Ambassador of the European Union, now officially accredited as Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary, is appointed by the President of the European Council and the President of the European Commission, following a proposal by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy.

40|$|The {{safety and}} {{security}} of the European citizen is something {{that most of us}} take for granted. Being controlled at borders such as airports is a matter of routine and we quite rightly have confidence in the monitoring of the European borders to keep us safe. Unfortunately, events like Chernobyl and the SARS virus, although rare, demonstrate that not everything can be stopped at borders and a different approach needs to be taken. Where possible chemical, biological, radiological or nuclear materials and agents released during an event, either by intention, accident or naturally occurring, should be identified and monitored to allow their impact on the population and environment to be minimised. With this aim a long term programme has been funded by the EU with a budget of € 95 m (2010 - 2013) from the Instrument for Stability. The IfS is a strategic tool designed to address a number of global security and development challenges for the European Union. As a result, the EU Chemical, Biological, Radiological or Nuclear Centres of Excellence Risk Mitigation Initiative, or CBRN CoE, was created and is managed by the European Commission. The Commission, working together with the <b>European</b> Union’s <b>External</b> <b>Action</b> <b>Service</b> (EEAS), the technical support of European Commission’s in-house science service (Joint Research Centre) and United Nations Interregional Crime and Justice Research Institute (UNICRI) to help implementation, have been working together to make the initiative what it is today.
