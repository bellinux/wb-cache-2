40|$|ME 450 Capstone Design and Manufacturing Experience: Winter 2015 Farmers in the Cooperative KGPB (Kolaborasyon Gwoupman Peyizan O’Boy) in Borgne, Haiti have {{identified}} breadfruit {{as one of}} the most wasted agricultural products in the area because it is hard to transport, store, and preserve. One problem for Haitian farmers in Bornge is that they lack the ability to store breadfruit for longer use. Breadfruit is also difficult to transport to market on the mountain goat paths, and everyone in the area harvests it at the same time, overwhelming the market. With so much breadfruit available at one time, the price drops, making transporting it not worth the effort. The goal of this project is to help the local people get through the hungry-season and make more profit by converting breadfruit into flour through several simple processes: shred, dry and grind. In flour form, it will be much easier for farmers to store and transport the product for future eating and selling. For this project, we would design and build a prototype <b>food</b> <b>grinder</b> that could be integrated with the shredding and drying systems under development by Multidisciplinary teams of students in a similar capstone course at RIT...|$|E
40|$|In recent years,installation of <b>food</b> waste <b>grinder</b> {{drainage}} {{systems have been}} increasing mainly in the metropolitan area. It is reported that the <b>food</b> waste <b>grinder</b> drainage system was installed in 50000 houses {{in the year of}} 2003. This paper described the drainage load of <b>food</b> waste <b>grinder</b> drainage system,and maintenance of this system. The following are the two objectives of this study. (1) First of all,to measuring an average flow rate of sanitary fixture(qd-value) for designing a <b>food</b> waste <b>grinder</b> drainage system,and compare with previous reference value and standard of SHASE-S 206. And to clarify drainage load calculation method for the design of <b>food</b> waste <b>grinder</b> drainage system. (2) To examine how the drainage with grinded food waste flows to lower stories of the building,as the important issue of maintenance management...|$|R
50|$|The classic Roaster Oven {{comes in}} many sizes and colors. The basic {{design of the}} Spa Pro® Massage Stone Heater {{is based on the}} roaster over. The current prodict line {{includes}} a coffee blade grinder, coffee roasters, coffee urn, <b>food</b> slicers, <b>food</b> <b>grinders,</b> pressure cookers, juice blenders, water kettles, food steamers, bread machine, waffle maker, toasters, and a portable induction cooktop.|$|R
50|$|Metal Ware {{continues}} to expand its product lines and find new paths to develop markets and build value. The Open Country® collection now includes a Fish Scaler, Jerky Seasonings and cooking accessories for outdoor enthusiasts, and the electrics line contains an array of pressure cookers, Jet-Steam Ovens, bread maker, <b>food</b> <b>grinders</b> and slicers, hand blenders, juicers and coffee products. In developing its coffee bean roaster, Metal Ware developed a unique method to convert the harsh odors typical of this process into the fragrance that draws coffee lovers.|$|R
50|$|Bo01s strong {{environmental}} profile {{is evident in}} many of the districts features. Solar cells and solar thermal collectors are present on many of the buildings, other renewable electricity is provided by the districts own wind turbine Boel situated in Norra Hamnen. The original plan envisioned a system of '100 per cent renewable energy', however energy consumption proved to be higher than estimated. Heating and cooling is provided through district heating and waste is disposed of {{in a number of ways}} - some houses are fitted with <b>food</b> waste <b>grinders</b> in sinks, others are supplied with paper bags which are dispensed into a vacuum waste disposal unit.|$|R
50|$|Oralu kallu {{used to be}} a {{standard}} fixture of every household in the past. They were laid in flush with the kitchen floor or inlaid into counters or as separate stone unit within or outside homes. With availability and utility of mixer <b>grinders,</b> <b>food</b> processors, and commercial wet grinders, the oralu kallu has almost disappeared from urban areas and is on the decline in rural areas. Some believe that foods prepared using an oralu kallu taste better than foods processed in mixer grinders.|$|R
50|$|Small {{appliances}} {{are typically}} small household electrical machines,also very useful and easily carried and installed. Some are classified with white goods, and relate to {{heating and cooling}} such as: fans and window mounted air conditioners, and heaters such as space heaters, ceramic heaters, gas heaters, kerosene heaters, and fan heaters. Yet another category {{is used in the}} kitchen, including: juicers, electric mixers, meat grinders, coffee grinders, deep fryers, herb <b>grinders,</b> <b>food</b> processors, electric kettles, waffle irons, coffee makers, blenders and dough blenders, rice cookers, toasters and exhaust hoods.|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of sorghum in human nutrition and <b>food</b> security The <b>grinders</b> of Compatible Technology International (CTI) {{were brought to}} El Salvador in 2009, for a project of CENTA-INTSORMIL/USAID to promote the grinding of sorghum for human nutrition. In 2011, ten of these grinders had been installed in small bakers associations, individual bakers, or persons producing ethnic drinks based on roasted and ground cereals. These people had been trained in sorghum use for human nutrition at the food technology laboratory of CENTA. The grinders are being used in areas were the access to other foods is limited and were sorghum can help to improve the nutritional status of the population. Sorghum has a large potential {{in the effort to}} reduce malnutrition because it is locally produced and can be processed in very healthy foods. For that reason it has been used to substitute milk in times of scarcity, to feed elder or sick persons because of the minerals it contains and in general as a resource in case of poverty or a bad harvest of corn. Sorghum also has important dietary values for its content of fiber and antioxidants and is recommended for diabetics and celiacs because it has no gluten and its carbohydrates digest slowly. Both the availability and the nutritious quality offer important benefits for the rural communities. INTSORMIL, CENTA and COMPATIBLE TECHNOLOGY INTERNACIONAL (CTI) INTSORMIL is a collaborative research program of the universities of Kansas, Nebraska, Ohio, Purdue and Texas A 2 ̆ 6 M with the financial support of US-AID. CENTA is the national agricultural research and extension institute of El Salvador, with activities in genetic improvement of corn, bean and sorghum varieties. Several sorghum varieties have been released and distributed among the farmers and the use of sorghum for human nutrition has been demonstrated and promoted to their families and people with a small food processing business. COMPATIBLE TECHNOLOGY INTERNACIONAL is a nonprofit organization from Minnesota, aimed at providing appropriate technology solutions for developing countries, mainly in postharvest and health topics. Their grinders are designed to produce fine flour on a small scale and at a low cost. This manual {{is the result of the}} interaction of the three organizations mentioned and of the experience obtained from grinding sorghum with the CTI grinders and training people at the Food Technology Laboratory of CENTA...|$|R
