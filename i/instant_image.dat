The price for the 60GB model was dropped to US$449 with fewer bundled accessories, making the dock, FireWire cable, and television cable extra-cost options. On the same day, Apple announced the iPod Camera Connector which allowed instant transfer of images from a USB-compatible digital camera to the iPod Photo. The main difference between this and Belkin's Digital Camera Link was that Apple's unit supported <b>instant</b> <b>image</b> viewing on the iPod Photo after transfer without having to connect the iPod Photo to a computer first.|$|E

30|$|Our {{findings}} indicate that radiologists and radiographers differ from clinicians in their perception of to what extent patients are referred for imaging that is most unlikely to affect treatment, {{as well as of}} the reasons for such referrals. There may be several causes of these discrepancies. The digitalisation of radiology may have increased the psychological and physical distance between the referral clinicians, radiologists and radiographers. Electronic referrals and reports, together with decentralised <b>instant</b> <b>image</b> access have reduced the need for physical meetings. The increasing volume of imaging procedures has put radiologists under pressure [11], marginalising consultations between radiologists and clinicians.|$|E

Information about specific software tools {{and their use}} is often obtained from web documents, such as blogs and product sites. In addition, instructional web pages for specific software need to be created. The process of creating instructional web pages that include text and captured images involves several steps and is time-consuming because the editor must prepare captured image files and upload them to the server. To quickly and efficiently upload clipboard images to instructional web pages, we propose a method that includes the following functions: (1) uploading captured images using a shortcut key, (2) an <b>instant</b> <b>image</b> editor, and (3) organization of text and images in a WYSIWYG manner.

A fidelity term is added to Weickert’s equation, and the coefficient of fidelity term will vary adaptively with the <b>instant</b> <b>image,</b> which makes the diffusion term and the fidelity term come to a better compromise. Otherwise, when deciding the edge directions, because of the strong smoothness of linear Gaussian function, a few other edge directions hiding in the main direction will be lost. To preserve these detailed edge directions, Gaussian kernel is substituted for nonlinear wavelet threshold. In addition, {{in order to preserve}} the textures and details as much as possible, a nonlocal diffusion tensor was introduced, and the two eigenvalues are reset by combining the two methods: edge-enhancing diffusion and coherence-enhancing diffusion. Experiments show that the new model has an obvious effect on preserving textures and details...|$|E

This paper presents an automatic system which can detect road traffic and let blind people know about that {{so that they can}} easily cross the road. In the recent years, Android-driven mobile phones have got popularity among users and developers as well. In the first place, we have selected Android-driven phone to get the desired output. We have used real time image processing system to detect traffic condition of a road. To implement this, at first we needed a camera with good resolutions, a methodology which will give the decisions and last but not the least Internet connection. The captured image will run through the application and then the application automatically sends this information to the cloud. The cloud will automatically send information to the blind by internet whether it is safe to cross the road or not. Later, it became so complex that we had to change our path and decided to make a custom application which will automatically decide whether it is safe to cross the road or not by capturing <b>instant</b> <b>images</b> and process using OpenCV.

In fact, when designing complicated building assemblies by making use of common graphical representations, it might be impossible for the operator to choose the proper shape and installation sequence of components {{so that they do}} not interfere during the assembly, and to check, in the meantime, the most favorable setting up modalities according to execution problems. Our software, running within CAD, by starting from the definition of the node features, will allow the operator to automatically get three types of representation that can simulate the assembly according to the assigned installation sequence: - <b>instant</b> <b>images</b> of the phases for setting up each component into the node, - 3 D views showing the position of each component disassembled from the node and indicating the movements required for connection, - the components moving while the node is being constructed. All the representations can be updated step by step each time modifications to the node are made. Through this digital iterative design process - that takes advantage of various simultaneous and realistic prefigurations - the shape and function compatibility between the elements during the assembling can be verified. Furthermore, the software can quickly check whether any change and integration to the node is efficacious, rising the approximation levels in the design phase.

Methods: This cross-sectional survey was conducted to present an <b>instant</b> <b>image</b> of 139 Iranian hospitals` performance status applying ratio analysis as one of the non parametric technical efficiency assessment methods in 2008. Data was collected using nine dimensional questionnaires supported by world wide web to achieve main hospital ratios. Final analysis was performed applying classic statistics and relevant statistical tests on significant level of 0. 05. Results: Four hospital performance indicators were estimated in the studied hospitals as follows: Bed turnover rate (BTR) was fluctuated from 64. 5 to 114. 8 times for hospitals located in rich and poor areas respectively. Moreover Bed Interval Rate (BIT) was calculated 1. 36 versus 2. 4 in the poor and rich areas. Average length of stay (ALS) was computed 1. 82 for the poor regions but 3. 27 for the rich ones furthermore, a positive statistical significant correlation was seen between ALS and the hospital size (P= 0. 001,r= 0. 28). Average bed occupancy rate (BOR) was 57. 8 % and its variation was from 31. 4 % to 64. 5 % depending on the hospital size so that there was a positive statistical significant relationship between the hospital size and BOR (P= 0. 006, r= 0. 32). Conclusion: Regarding that BOR, ALS, BTR and BIT along with mortality rates are mentioned as the most considerable performance indicators, applying analytic frameworks more than considering single and raw indicators are severely recommended...|$|E
40|$|This study {{compared}} the radiopacity of 41 resin-based materials using conventional dental x-ray film (Ultraspeed-D) and a digital system (Digora) based on storage phosphor plate technology. For the film-based technique, optical density measurements {{were carried out}} using an X-Rite densitometer. Al equivalents (mm) were calculated {{as described in the}} literature using a calibration curve of Optical Density versus the thickness of aluminum. Regarding the digital system after exposures of 0. 16 and 0. 32 seconds, the images were exported to an image processing software (NIH Image Engineering). An approach similar to that used for optical density was used to generate a calibration curve for gray pixel values. Linear correlations were found between the percentage of fillers by weight and x-ray film radiopacity and the Digora system, and the same coefficient of estimation was recorded (r= 0. 60; p! 0. 05). A linear correlation was also observed between the conventional x-ray film technique and the Digora system (r= 0. 93; pless than or equal to 0. 05). Using two different exposure times did not affect the radiopacity. Considerable differences were found among materials of the same category. Flowable resin composites were more radiopaque than dentin, while microfine composites were "radiolucent. " Most of the available resin-based materials were more radiopaque than enamel. The radiopacity of resin composites depended on their fillers (percentage and type). Using elements with low atomic numbers (Si) resulted in radiolucent materials, while adding elements with high molecular numbers (Ba, Y, Yb), resulted in radiopaque resin composites. Despite the numerous benefits offered by the digital imaging system (low irradiation dose, <b>instant</b> <b>image,</b> image manipulation), the conventional x-ray film technique seems to be more accurate for radiopacity measurements...|$|E

In fact, some quality standards such as AATCC, ASTM for pilling, wrinkling etc are based on such subjective evaluation practice. With the requirement of speedy, objective, digital information communication, manpower saving in quality control of textile, it is necessary to develop objective methods to evaluate fabric appearance in order to build a digital quality communication network and an instant quality bridge between manufactures, retailers and consumers. We have developed a digital system with special lighting and new algorithms for the evaluation of fabric appearance attributes such as pilling, wrinkling, polar fleece fabrics etc. The system has the following features:• Intelligent as an experienced judge. • <b>Instant</b> <b>image</b> capturing and high-speed image processing, delivering quality parameters in less than 2 second and easy to be linked with network and using internet to evaluate the product quality remotely. • Interactive means to define the suitable features of textile products according to operator's requirements freely, and simple operation for user. • Impartial means getting the same objective results of textile products even for different operators, in different places and at different times. The present system can be used for quality testing, measurement, evaluation and control. Since it can evaluate fabric appearance objectively. Objective standards rather than subjective standards can be established based on this system. It can eliminate the problems with the poor agreement between laboratories and/or among judges. It can also offer remote services of quality evaluation and may not be necessary to transport products from far away in order to evaluate appearance quality.
