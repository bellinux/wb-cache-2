Several women approached Stojanović to kiss his hands; he declined this mark of respect, saying that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> priest but a communist.|$|E
5|$|By the 1980s, Suharto's grip {{on power}} was {{maintained}} by the emasculation of civil society, engineered elections, {{and use of the}} military's coercive powers. Upon his retirement from the military in June 1976, Suharto undertook a re-organisation of the armed forces that concentrated power away from commanders to the president. In March 1983, he appointed General Leonardus Benjamin Moerdani as head of the armed forces who adopted a hardline on elements who challenged the administration.

5|$|During her {{graduate}} studies and postgraduate appointment as a botany instructor, McClintock {{was instrumental in}} assembling a group that studied the new field of cytogenetics in maize.

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Duigan desired command of the Second New Zealand Expeditionary Force (2NZEF), which was to be raised for service in Europe. Lack of command experience and his performance as CGS meant that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> popular choice within the military or the New Zealand Government. Major General Bernard Freyberg was instead appointed commander of 2NZEF, and Duigan's term as CGS was extended. Throughout 1940, Duigan worked to ensure the continued support and reinforcement of 2NZEF, and oversaw the reintroduction of conscription. He also attended defence conferences in Singapore and India, and made tours of the 2NZEF while it was in the Middle East.|$|E

5|$|Harvey was an attacking and {{free-flowing}} batsman but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> prolific scorer, {{which was}} attributed by observers {{to a lack}} of single-mindedness required to succeed at the top level. Neil said that Ray's footwork was suspect and that the stronger bowlers in domestic cricket were able to exploit this. Neil said that if Ray had been able to rectify his weakness, then he could have become a Test player for Australia. Australian captain Bill Lawry said that Harvey was one of the two best district cricketers he had faced. Aside from his batting, Harvey was an occasional leg spinner, and was known for his fielding ability.|$|E

Lenin recalled him to Moscow in 1921, elevating him to full membership of the Central Committee and Orgburo, and putting him in charge of the party secretariat.

After that term ended, President Franklin D. Roosevelt appointed Shepard recorder of deeds in Washington, D.C., a position he held until 1951.

John Logan, Joss Whedon, Ed Solomon, Christopher McQuarrie, and David Hayter wrote the script, with Hayter receiving sole credit.

5|$|It {{is unclear}} who, if anyone, {{was in charge}} of the ship at this point, as Luke Collingwood had been gravely ill for some time. The man who would {{normally}} have replaced him, first mate James Kelsall, had been previously suspended from duty following an argument on 14November. Robert Stubbs had captained a slave ship several decades earlier and he temporarily commanded Zong during Collingwood's incapacitation, but <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>a</b> registered member of the vessel's crew. According to historian James Walvin, the breakdown of the command structure on the ship might explain the subsequent navigational errors and the absence of checks on supplies of drinking water.|$|E
