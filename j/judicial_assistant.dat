40|$|Max Arthur Macauliffe, {{originally}} Michael McAuliffe (1838 - 1913), Indian Civil Servant, judge, and Sikh scholar, {{was born}} in Glenmore, Monagea, Co. Limerick, Ireland. He graduated from Queen 2 ̆ 7 s College Galway in 1860 and began his colonial career in India in 1864.

Born a Catholic, when he lived in Amritsar Macauliffe became deeply interested in the Sikh religion. He learned the languages of the Sikh scripture, the Adi Granth, and did the classic translation of major parts of it into English. In 1909 the Clarendon Press published his celebrated work, The Sikh Religion: Its Gurus, Sacred Writings and Authors, in six volumes. He saw his translation as pioneering in that he collaborated closely with indigenous Sikh scholars and he committed to writing what had previously been orally communicated.

40|$|Providing a socio-legal {{analysis}} of the issues, expert evidence and judgment in Reay and Hope v BNFL plc., the thesis offers an insight into {{the complexity of the}} toxic tort. Starting with an overview of the history of Sellafield, the thesis reflects on the scientific and epidemiological concerns surrounding the link between childhood cancer and nuclear installations. Drawing on scientific knowledge and epistemological considerations, the thesis moves on to the difficulties of verifying causation in science and the problems of establishing causation in law. Outlining the role of the expert witness and scientific expert evidence, the thesis proceeds with a case analysis, before broaching the thorny issue of judicial decision making and in particular, the difference between the 'discovery' and 'justification' process. Moving on to the Judgment in Reay and Hope, attention is given to the potential application of probability theory to the judicial decision making process. Lasting just short of one hundred days and including the testimony of numerous scientific experts, Reay and Hope marked new ground in a number of ways; it was the first personal injury claim to test the concept of genetic damage from radiation; the only time that a Queen's Bench Division Judge had been allocated a full-time <b>judicial</b> <b>assistant,</b> {{and one of the first}} trials to endorse a satellite video link for examination of international expert witnesses. As far as judicial management is concerned, the case was a forerunner in having Counsels' Opening Statements in writing in advance of the trial, as well as having written daily submissions of key issues from plaintiffs and defendants upon conclusion of oral evidence. The circumstances that led to the trial relate to events in excess of thirty to forty years ago when the fathers of Dorothy Reay and Vivien Hope were employed by the Defendants and their predecessors (the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority) as fitters for the Sellafield Plant. Intrinsic to the litigation was whether paternal preconception irradiation caused or materially contributed to a predisposition to cancer leading to Dorothy's death from leukaemia and Vivien Hope's non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. As a consequence of the various statutory provisions, the Plaintiffs did not need to prove negligence on the part of the Defendants. In order to succeed the Plaintiffs had to prove on the balance of probabilities that radiation from Sellafield was a material contributory cause of the Plaintiffs' disease. The fundamental issue therefore was causation. In addition to the case analysis, two pieces of empirical research were conducted for the purposes of this thesis. The first, a Social Survey (consisting of thirty four questions) was circulated to 160 members of the Academy of Experts (quantitative research); the second, a letter, involved written communication with sixty five judges from the Queen's Bench Division of the High Court (qualitative research). Underlying this socio-legal case analysis are fundamental questions with regard to existing legal principles, liability and judicial decision making.

25|$|A {{single judge}} can handle normal {{contentious}} and penal cases. A college {{of at least}} three judges, however, must try cases involving an excommunication, the dismissal of a cleric, or the annulment of the bond of marriage or of sacred ordination (can. 1425 §1). The bishop can assign up to five judges to a case that is very difficult or important (can. 1425 §2). Otherwise, the judicial vicar assigns cases to the judges and, in those cases which require three or more judges, presides over the panel or assigns one of his <b>assistant</b> <b>judicial</b> vicars to preside, if there are any. The judicial vicar and the <b>assistant</b> <b>judicial</b> vicars must be priests with doctorates or at least licenses in canon law.

40|$|Background: The aim of {{this paper}} was to examine how {{temperament}} might moderate the health impact of psychosocial hazards at work and thus to attempt to identify the temperament risk factor in the judiciary staff. Material and Methods: The data were collected from 355 court employees, including judges, <b>judicial</b> <b>assistants,</b> court clerks and service workers from criminal, civil, commercial as well as from labor and social insurance divisions. The psychosocial work environment was measured with the Psychosocial Working Conditions Questionnaire by Cieślak and Widerszal-Bazyl, temperament with Cloninger’s Temperament and Character Inventory adopted by Hornowska and employee health status was screened with Goldberg’s General Health Questionnaire- 28 (GHQ- 28) adopted by Makowska and Merecz. The health impact of job strain with moderating effects of temperament traits was estimated with logistic regression (forward stepwise selection based on the likelihood ratio for the model). Results: The analyses confirmed the moderating role of temperament in the health consequences of work-related stress. High score in novelty seeking was identified as independent temperament risk factor for mental health disturbances in judiciary staff facing at least medium job demands. The job control was a protective factor while relative risk of negative health outcomes was also elevated due to female gender. Conclusions: Temperament may control sensitivity to the environmental exposure to psychosocial hazards at work and its health consequences. Further research is needed to explore and understand better the moderating role of temperament in the relation between job stress (strain) and health in different vocational groups and workplaces.
