5|$|In March 2006, the Rocky Flats Stewardship Council {{was formed}} to address {{post-closure}} management of Rocky <b>Flats</b> <b>and</b> provide a forum for public discussion. This organization was the successor organization to the Rocky Flats Coalition of Local Governments, which advocated for stakeholders during the site cleanup. The Council includes elected officials from nine municipal governments neighboring Rocky <b>Flats</b> <b>and</b> four skilled/experienced organizations and/or individuals. Information and Council meetings minutes and reports are available on its website. Members of the public are welcome to attend Council meetings.|$|E

5|$|During the 1920s {{there was}} a dirt {{airstrip}} known as Dutch Flats {{in what is now}} the Midway neighborhood of Point Loma.

The Sheffield Tramway was closed, and {{a new system of}} roads, including the Inner Ring Road, were laid out.

5|$|The {{sea onion}} Paranthus rapiformis lives on subtidal mud <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> burrows into the sediment, holding itself {{in place by}} {{expanding}} its basal disc to form an anchor. If it gets washed out of its burrow by strong currents, it contracts into a pearly glistening ball which rolls about. Tube-dwelling anemones which live in parchment-like tubes, are in the anthozoan subclass Ceriantharia, and are only distantly related to sea anemones.|$|E

One bomb landed on an Anderson Air Raid Shelter, killing {{a man and his}} wife. Another landed on the railway signal box, killing the signalman. Several bombs fell on a War Department gunnery range, causing no damage. Some 200 German bombs {{fell on the}} mud <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> sandbanks off Shoeburyness. Many were delayed-action bombs, and went off at irregular intervals.|$|E
5|$|Aylmer Road is a {{very short}} stretch of road, running west for {{less than half a}} mile between the {{junction}} with the A1000 in Haringey to the junction with The Bishops Avenue in Barnet. The entire southern side of the road is taken up by Highgate Golf Course, while the northern side is a mixture of small shops, <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> allotments. The road is named for General Sir Fenton John Aylmer, VC KCB, who received the Victoria Cross for his part in the assault on Nilt Fort on 2 December 1891.|$|E
5|$|Between 1631 and 1890, {{the city}} tripled its area through land {{reclamation}} by filling in marshes, mud <b>flats,</b> <b>and</b> gaps between wharves along the waterfront. The largest reclamation efforts {{took place during}} the 19th century; beginning in 1807, the crown of Beacon Hill was used to fill in a 50-acre (20ha) mill pond that later became the Haymarket Square area. The present-day State House sits atop this lowered Beacon Hill. Reclamation projects {{in the middle of the}} century created significant parts of the South End, the West End, the Financial District, and Chinatown.|$|E

5|$|Downtown Cleveland is {{centered}} on Public Square and includes {{a wide range of}} diversified districts. Downtown Cleveland is home to the traditional Financial District and Civic Center, as well as the distinct Cleveland Theater District, which is home to Playhouse Square Center. Mixed-use neighborhoods such as the <b>Flats</b> <b>and</b> the Warehouse District are occupied by industrial and office buildings as well as restaurants and bars. The number of downtown housing units in the form of condominiums, lofts, and apartments has been on the increase since 2000. Recent developments include the revival of the Flats, the Euclid Corridor Project, and the developments along East 4th Street.|$|E
5|$|Dredd is a 2012 science-fiction action film {{directed}} by Pete Travis and written and produced by Alex Garland. It {{is based on}} the 2000 AD comic strip Judge Dredd and its eponymous character created by John Wagner and Carlos Ezquerra. Karl Urban stars as Judge Dredd, a law enforcer given the power of judge, jury and executioner in a vast, dystopic metropolis called Mega-City One that lies in a post-apocalyptic wasteland. Dredd and his apprentice partner, Judge Anderson (Olivia Thirlby), are forced to bring order to a 200-storey high-rise block of <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> deal with its resident drug lord, Ma-Ma (Lena Headey).|$|E
5|$|During the summer, the American white ibis roams {{along the}} coast of tidal <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> {{mangrove}} swamps as the inland marshes are usually flooded. However, as the water level recedes in the fall, populations at the coast shift their foraging area inland, to inland marshes and swamplands. It has become more common in urban landscapes in Florida since the late 1990s, and is {{one of a number of}} wetland-dependent bird species which forages in man-made ponds on golf courses in the southwest of the state.|$|E

5|$|In {{the early}} years in western Virginia, pioneer {{settlers}} were primarily concerned with providing defense from Native American attacks, so little emphasis was placed upon education. Education {{was viewed as a}} religious duty, to be provided for at home, where its quality was dependent upon the spare time and level of education of parents. With the growth of settlement in Pearsall's <b>Flats,</b> <b>and</b> later Romney, the need for educational facilities became apparent and the community began plans for the establishment of schools and churches.|$|E

At the prefab town, Quatermass sees that 'the mark' and strange behaviour are associated with those who find the fallen meteorites, but before he can find out more the community police order him away.|$|E
5|$|St Kilda is {{adjacent}} to the mangrove forest bordering Barker Inlet, part of the largest tidal estuary of Gulf St Vincent. Late in the 19th Century embankments were constructed through the mangroves {{in an effort to}} reclaim land for pasturing. With the construction of the banks of the adjacent saltfields maintenance of the embankments ceased and the mangroves began to reclaim them. One of these embankments is used as the beginning of a boardwalk through the mangroves which forms a 1.7km loop through the samphire saltmarsh <b>flats</b> <b>and</b> mangroves reaching the border between the ocean and forest.|$|E
