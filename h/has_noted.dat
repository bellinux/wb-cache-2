50|$|In addition, the {{industry}} {{has been criticized for}} lacking in racial diversity. For example, critics <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> that there are few Asian plus size models. Others <b>have</b> <b>noted</b> that there are few black plus-size models with darker skin tones.|$|R
5|$|Glatter <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> {{that the}} episode exemplifies {{the themes of}} longing and desire which she feels {{characterize}} the series; she has also called to attention its careful balance between tragic and comic elements. Exterior scenes in the episode were filmed in California's Angeles National Forest and blended with stock footage of Washington to enhance the setting.|$|E
5|$|Jim Reardon {{directed}} the episode and <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> {{he remembers the}} episode for several scenes in which the action is viewed through windows, such as when Homer prank calls the dean. The animators were short on time, so {{for the design of}} Benjamin they took an earlier drawing of director Rich Moore and made it African-American.|$|E
5|$|To {{create a}} sense of realism, Scott and Washington interviewed {{numerous}} men and women whose real-life occupations pertained to positions in the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; Washington <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that he and Scott conducted similar research during the productions of Man on Fire and Crimson Tide.|$|E

5|$|A scene {{featuring}} multiple clones of {{the character}} Kurt Crawford was achieved with motion control photography, allowing actor David Lovgren to portray all of the clones—multiple takes were recorded with the actor in different positions within the scene, and by using a camera controlled by a computer to follow exactly the same motions for each take, these could be seamlessly composited together. Producer Paul Rabwin <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that achieving these shots was difficult due to the mixture of green and blue light sources in the scene.|$|E
5|$|Another {{mushroom}} {{that grows}} on decomposing fruit bodies is Asterophora lycoperdoides, which {{is distinct from}} C.cookei because of the powdery brown asexual spores (chlamydospores) produced on the cap surface. Alexander H. Smith <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> a general similarity in appearance between C.cookei and the North American species Clitocybe sclerotoidea (then known as Tricholoma sclerotoideum), which is parasitic to Helvella lacunosa. However, C.sclerotoidea is larger than C.cookei, with cap diameters up to , and has more distantly spaced gills.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the extensiveness}} {{of the ruling}} in Anisminic, it appears {{that there may be}} {{instances}} where the courts will still be bound by the jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional error of law divide. Cane <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that there are three views. The first is that the distinction between jurisdictional and non-jurisdictional errors of law is still relevant, while the second is that all errors of law go to jurisdiction. The third view takes a middle ground that allows for certain exceptions to the approach in the second view.|$|E

5|$|Encountering MissingNo. causes {{graphical}} {{errors and}} the mass replication of the sixth item in the player's item menu; the latter effect resulted in the glitch's coverage by strategy guides and game magazines. IGN <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> MissingNo.'s appearance in Pokémon Red and Blue {{as one of the}} most famous video game glitches. Fans of the series have attempted to rationalize MissingNo. as part of the games' canon, and sociologists have studied its impact on players.|$|E
5|$|Fast is {{considered}} a skilled forward with good skating ability, hockey sense, and speed, the latter of which gives him an edge in retrieving pucks along the boards. He excels on the forecheck, is a reliable defensive forward, and plays well in the offensive, defensive, and neutral zones. Alain Vigneault has praised his work ethic and dependability, and teammate Tanner Glass <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> his ability to make responsible decisions and skillful plays with the puck along the defensive zone wall. One of Fast's drawbacks is he lacks the ideal frame for National Hockey League play, but his physical game improved after he added muscle in the 2014 offseason.|$|E
5|$|Kishimoto <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that {{he likes}} Shikamaru due to his easygoing nature despite being a genius, and contrasted him against Sasuke Uchiha's {{intelligent}} but abrasive personality. Kishimoto also comically remarked that he would marry Shikamaru {{if he were a}} girl, noting that Shikamaru would likely be successful in life. When designing Shikamaru's Part II appearance, Kishimoto wanted to give Shikamaru a unique appearance despite drawing him with a vest that several other ninja wear in the series. As a result, he drew his forehead protector on his arm in order to not obscure his hair.|$|E

5|$|Klaus Dodds <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> {{that there}} is a geopolitical aspect to the {{locations}} used, although this is often a pre-emption of an issue by the film. For example, in the first film, Dr. No, the title villain's disruption of the American Project Mercury space launch from Cape Canaveral with his atomic-powered radio beam mirrored claims that American rocket testing at Cape Canaveral had problems with rockets going astray. Similarly Bond's anti-heroin mission in Live and Let Die coincided with President Nixon's 1972 declaration of a War on Drugs, whilst GoldenEye played against the backdrop of Ronald Reagan's Strategic Defense Initiative.|$|E
5|$|Plantinga's {{version of}} the defence embraces Augustine's view of free will, but not his natural theology. Rather than attempt to show the {{existence}} of God as likely {{in the face of}} evil, as a theodicy does, Plantinga's free will defence attempts to show that belief in God is still logically possible, despite the existence of evil. Theologian Alister McGrath <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that, because Plantinga only argued that the coexistence of God and evil are logically possible, he did not present a theodicy, but a defence. Plantinga did not attempt to demonstrate that his proposition is true or plausible, just that it is logically possible.|$|E
5|$|Previous films by Hepworth and {{his company}} had been {{considered}} {{a continuation of the}} cinema of attractions. The first few years of the 20th century were a period in which many film-makers began placing a higher emphasis on portraying a narrative story, and lesser so more on the image and the ability to show something. The film is considered a step forward in both film grammar and structure. Contemporary audiences may find it rather hoary, although one scholar <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> the format would be familiar to fans of the dog character Lassie.|$|E

5|$|The game's soundtrack was {{composed}} by Keiichi Suzuki and Hirokazu Tanaka. Tanaka was {{a video game}} composer working for Nintendo who had previously composed for games such as Super Mario Land and Metroid, while Suzuki was a composer and musician for bands of many different genres. The NES was only able to play three notes at a time, which Suzuki <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> greatly limited what {{he was able to}} produce, as he could not create some of the sounds he wanted.|$|E
5|$|The {{local and}} {{upcoming}} weather of Kamloops is observed at this airport's weather station, {{referred to as}} the Kamloops Airport Weather Station. Nav Canada <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> that most of the aircraft winds near the Kamloops Airport blow east and west. It has been classified as an airport of entry by Nav Canada and is staffed by the Canada Border Services Agency. An aircraft at this airport may handle no more than 30 passengers. Skydiving can be performed at the airport through Skydive Kamloops. Passengers may also board a courtesy shuttle to other nearby municipalities, such as Blue River, British Columbia.|$|E
5|$|Typically found growing solitary, {{in groups}} or in {{clusters}} under hardwood trees, the fungus produces fruit {{bodies in the}} summer and autumn. In the New England area of the United States, mycologist Howard Bigelow <b>has</b> <b>noted</b> it to grow on road shoulders in grass near oaks; it also has a predilection for growing on sloping creek banks. In Malaysia, it is found growing on the soil in forests, mostly under species of Shorea (rainforest trees in the family Dipterocarpaceae). C.lateritius has been reported from the Western Ghats, Kerala, India, forming ectomycorrhizal association with endemic tree species like Vateria indica, Hopea parviflora, Diospyros malabarica, Myristica malabarica in semi-evergreen to evergreen forests.|$|E
