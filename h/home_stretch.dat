2500|$|In 2004, Romero {{ran for the}} Third District seat but {{finished}} third in the state's unique jungle primary. The seat in question was formerly held from 1980 to 2005 by Wilbert Joseph [...] "Billy" [...] Tauzin, Jr., a Democrat-turned-Republican. In the 2004 race, Romero faced the retiring Tauzin's son, Republican Billy Tauzin III and Democrat Charlie Melancon of Napoleonville, the seat of Assumption Parish, a sugar lobbyist and former State Representative with a long family history in Louisiana's sugar industry. The race was highly controversial, as the elder Tauzin convinced the state Republican party to endorse his son, upsetting many of Romero's supporters and fueling charges of nepotism. In the <b>home</b> <b>stretch</b> of the race, the Tauzin campaign released several advertisements accusing Romero of being a liberal, most notably claiming that he supported the legalization of sodomy. Under the jungle primary system, if the leading candidate does not receive over 50 percent of the vote, the top two finishers in a race - regardless of party affiliation - advance to a runoff election, which is held several weeks after the national general election. On election day, Romero missed the primary by a razor-thin margin, receiving 22 percent of the vote to Melancon's 23 percent and Tauzin's 32 percent. Another factor contributing to Romero's defeat may have been his refusal in 2003 to endorse the Republican candidate for governor, Bobby Jindal, who lost to the Democrat Kathleen Babineaux Blanco of Lafayette.|$|E

40|$|Advisor: Ron Andrews, PT, PhDBackground There is {{substantial}} evidence regarding direct myofascial release and other manual therapy techniques {{aimed at reducing}} myofascial restrictions. Foam rolling is advertised as a tool capable of providing “self-myofascial release”. Evidence assessing foam rolling’s abilities to reduce myofascial restrictions is lacking, and the available evidence is not of substantial quality. This capstone aims to assess the literature regarding foam rolling, and compare the outcomes to higher quality studies assessing direct myofascial release through manual therapy. Case Description The patient was a 66 year old female presenting to a Veteran’s Affairs Medical Center (VA) in New Mexico. Her chief complaint was right groin and buttock pain. She had unrestricted lumbar range of motion, no neurological symptoms, and right hip joint mobility limited by muscle tightness and pain. She also presented with palpable myofascial restrictions in the lumbar spine and right psoas and gluteal muscles, which was the most likely cause of her pain. She was seen {{for a total of}} 4 visits over 6 weeks. Her treatment consisted of manual therapy, a <b>home</b> <b>stretching</b> program, and foam rolling. Outcomes The patient’s symptoms significantly decreased after 4 treatments and she was able to resume most of her previous activities without being limited by pain. She was instructed on proper use of a foam roller prior to discharge, and was issued a foam roller by the VA to continue addressing her significantly decreased painful symptoms upon discharge, in addition to continuing her <b>home</b> <b>stretching</b> program Discussion An evidence based literature review was performed to address the limited research available on foam rolling, and compare it to direct myofascial release techniques used to reduce myofascial restrictions. Direct myofascial release was defined as applying force and mechanical stress to palpable tissue restrictions in order to decrease the density of the fascia and reduce restrictions. Foam rolling can be used to roll over restricted tissues to apply a mechanical stress, using the patient’s own body weight as the force, making it similar to the manual techniques being utilized in physical therapy The available research shows that foam rolling can reduce pain and increase range of motion, however further, high-quality research {{needs to be done to}} examine the legitimacy behind the practice of foam rolling being used to perform self-myofascial release of soft tissue restrictions...|$|R

40|$|The {{following}} case {{describes a}} 68 year-old {{woman with a}} 7 ½ year history of worsening head and neck pain diagnosed as trigeminal neuralgia following surgical resection of a brain tumor. After years of unsuccessful management with medication and physical therapies, a therapeutic trial of chiropractic was carried out. Chiropractic care included ultrasound, manual therapies (manipulation and mobilization), soft tissue therapies, and <b>home</b> <b>stretching</b> exercises. After an initial treatment period followed by 18 months of supportive care the patient reported satisfactory improvement. It became evident that {{there were at least}} three sources of her symptoms: mechanical and/or degenerative neck pain, temporomandibular joint syndrome, and trigeminal neuralgia. While never completely pain-free, the patient continued to report that her pains reduced to minimal at times. At the most recent follow-up, the pain had not returned to pre-treatment intractable levels. This case study demonstrates the importance of diagnosing and treating multiple sources of pain and the positive role chiropractic care can have in the management of patients with these clinical conditions.

40|$|Geographic work on {{gay male}} spatiality {{has focused on}} gay men's uses of public spaces, and on {{their role in the}} {{gentrification}} of certain neighbourhoods, while largely neglecting the ongoing importance of home to gay men. This paper seeks to address this lacuna by considering how gay Australian men have used homes to constitute and affirm their sexual identities. To do this I draw on Garry Wotherspoon's (1986) "Being Different", a collection of autobiographies written by gay Australian men, constructing four vignettes that illustrate gay men's identity-affirming uses of homes. I find that gay men use 'private' homes in rather 'unhomely' - that is, non-heteronormative - ways, by inviting in 'external' non-normative discourses, bodies and activities in order to 'queer' domestic space and engender non-heteronormative socialization and identity-affirmation. Moreover, I find that through some of these uses, 'private' homes are often made to interact closely with, and reach into, 'public' sites of belonging, such as bars and beats, 'stretching' home, and rendering these public sites 'homelike'. Consequently, gay men's queered <b>homes</b> <b>stretch</b> beyond the physical house, enriching our understanding of how home is simultaneously private and public. 17 page(s...|$|R
50|$|At {{the time}} of the Lords of Winterau, the castle’s outer girding wall {{enclosed}} an extensive area, as still witnessed today by the cadastral names Hinter den Ziunen or Hinter den Zäunen (“Behind the Fences”) and In der Zingel or In der Ringmauer (“In the Girding Wall”). After the Thirty Years' War, the citizens of Heidesheim began to use this wall as a quarry, tearing it down in the process. Andreas Trauttner’s 1754 map shows the Windeck already in the shape seen today. The originally open area between the tower and the inner wall is covered by a gabled roof and thus used as a stately <b>home</b> <b>stretching</b> across the north, east and southeast around the tower. In the southwest and west, the wall has been levelled, through which the tower on the building’s western edge rises. It is likely that Samuel Beck gave it this shape after 1626. The ogival-arch portal and the large-scale crossbar windows (windows divided by cross-shaped spars into groups of four windows) in Gothic Revival style stem from the time after 1860, as does the room layout inside. The outbuildings shown in the cadastral plans from 1812 and from 1841 to 1843 have disappeared.|$|R
