40|$|AbstractHuman {{parvovirus}} B 19 (B 19) is {{a well-known}} pathogenic agent which causes apoptosis in erythrocyte lineage cells. Here, we provide the first evidence that mitochondrial autophagy is specifically found in the B 19 -infected cells. The protein expression ratio for LC 3 -II/LC 3 -I increased significantly in infected cells, indicating possible involvement of cellular autophagy in the infection process. Immunofluorescence confocal microscopy analyses revealed that B 19 infection induced an intracellular autophagosome as judged by <b>endogenous</b> LC 3 <b>staining.</b> Moreover, inhibition of autophagy by 3 -MA significantly facilitated B 19 -infection-mediated cell death. These results suggest a novel mechanism by which B 19 -infected cells survive by cellular autophagy...|$|R
40|$|Most tumor-associated antigens {{represent}} self-proteins and as {{a result}} are poorly immunogenic due to immune tolerance. Here we show that tolerance to carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA), which is overexpressed by the majority of lethal malignancies, can be reversed by immunization with a CEA-derived peptide. This peptide was altered to make it a more potent T cell antigen and loaded onto dendritic cells (DCs) for delivery as a cellular vaccine. Although DCs are rare in the blood, we found that treatment of advanced cancer patients with Flt 3 ligand, a hematopoietic growth factor, expanded DCs 20 -fold in vivo. Immunization with these antigen-loaded DCs induced CD 8 cytotoxic T lymphocytes that recognized tumor cells expressing <b>endogenous</b> CEA. <b>Staining</b> with peptide-MHC tetramers demonstrated the expansion of CD 8 T cells that recognize both the native and altered epitopes and possess an effector cytotoxic T lymphocyte phenotype (CD 45 RA+CD 27 −CCR 7 −). After vaccination, two of 12 patients experienced dramatic tumor regression, one patient had a mixed response, and two had stable disease. Clinical response correlated with the expansion of CD 8 tetramer+ T cells, confirming the role of CD 8 T cells in this treatment strategy...|$|R
40|$|Incorporation of Paramecium axonemal tubulin into lysed {{endosperm}} {{cells of}} the higher plant Haemanthus enabled us to identify sites of microtubule assembly. This exogenous Paramecium tubulin could be traced by specific antibodies that do not <b>stain</b> <b>endogenous</b> plant microtubules. Intracellular copolymerization of protozoan and higher plant tubulins gave rise to hybrid polymers that were visualized by immunofluorescence and by immunoelectron microscopy. The addition of exogenous tubulin revealed many free ends of endogenous microtubules that were competent to assemble ciliate tubulin. The functional roles of the nuclear surface and the equatorial region of the phragmoplast as plant microtubule-organizing centers, which were revealed by the intense incorporation of exogenous tubulin, are discussed. These data {{shed light on the}} present debate on higher plant microtubule organizing centers...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{complexity}} is unraveled at nanometer resolution using {{electron microscopy}} (EM), but interpretation of macromolecular functionality is {{hampered by the}} difficulty in interpreting greyscale images and the unidentified molecular content. We perform large-scale EM on mammalian tissue complemented with energy-dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) to allow EM-data analysis based on elemental composition. Endogenous elements, labels (gold and cadmium-based nanoparticles) as well as stains are analyzed at ultrastructural resolution. This provides a wide palette of colors to paint the traditional grey-scale EM images for composition-based interpretation. Our proof-ofprinciple application of EM-EDX reveals that endocrine and exocrine vesicles exist in single cells in Islets of Langerhans. This highlights how elemental mapping reveals unbiased biomedical relevant information. Broad application of EM-EDX will further allow experimental analysis on large-scale tissue using <b>endogenous</b> elements, multiple <b>stains,</b> and multiple markers and thus brings nanometer-scale 'color-EM' as a promising tool to unravel molecular (de) regulation in biomedicine...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe basic helix–loop–helix (bHLH) {{transcription}} factor, neuroD 2, induces {{neuronal differentiation}} and promotes neuronal survival. Reduced levels of neuroD 2 were previously shown to cause motor deficits, ataxia, and seizure propensity. Because neuroD 2 levels may be critical for brain function, we studied {{the regulation of}} neuroD 2 gene in cell culture and transgenic mouse models. In transgenic mice, a 10 -kb fragment of the neuroD 2 promoter fully recapitulated the <b>endogenous</b> neuroD 2 <b>staining</b> pattern. A 1 -kb fragment of the neuroD 2 promoter drove reporter gene expression in most, but not all neuroD 2 -positive neuronal populations. Mutation of two critical E-boxes, E 4 and E 5 (E 4 and E 5 situated 149 and 305 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site) eliminated gene expression. NeuroD 2 expression was diminished in mice lacking neurogenin 1 demonstrating that neurogenin 1 regulates neuroD 2 during murine brain development. These studies demonstrate that neuroD 2 expression is highly dependent on bHLH-responsive E-boxes in the proximal promoter region, that additional distal regulatory elements are important for neuroD 2 expression in a subset of cortical neurons, and that neurogenin 1 regulates neuroD 2 expression during mouse brain development...|$|R
40|$|Alzheimer’s disease (AD) is {{characterized}} by the deposition of senile plaques (SPs) and neurofibrillary tangles (NFTs) in vulnerable brain regions. SPs are composed of aggregated β-amyloid (Aβ) 40 / 42 (43) peptides. Evidence implicates a central role for Aβ in the pathophysiology of AD. Mutations in βAPP and presenilin 1 (PS 1) lead to elevated secretion of Aβ, especially the more amyloidogenic Aβ 42. Immunohistochemical studies have also emphasized the importance of Aβ 42 in initiating plaque pathology. Cell biological studies have demonstrated that Aβ is generated intracellularly. Recently, <b>endogenous</b> Aβ 42 <b>staining</b> was demonstrated within cultured neurons by confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and within neurons of PS 1 mutant transgenic mice. A central question about the role of Aβ in disease concerns whether extracellular Aβ deposition or intracellular Aβ accumulation initiates the disease process. Here we report that human neurons in AD-vulnerable brain regions specifically accumulate γ-cleaved Aβ 42 and suggest that this intraneuronal Aβ 42 immunoreactivity appears to precede both NFT and Aβ plaque deposition. This study suggests that intracellular Aβ 42 accumulation is an early event in neuronal dysfunction and that preventing intraneuronal Aβ 42 aggregation may be an important therapeutic direction for the treatment of AD...|$|R
40|$|Histidine-tagged {{proteins}} {{are widely}} used in biochemical studies and frequently detected with antibodies specific for the histidine tag. Immunocytochemistry is widely used in studies with overexpressed proteins to determine cellular localization {{and in the case}} of histidine-tagged proteins can be carried out with anti-polyhistidine antibodies. Recent studies have suggested that polyhistidine sequences are present within a small number of human proteins and may direct expression to the nucleus and nuclear speckles compartments of the cell. In this study immunocytochemical staining of human SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cell lines with the HIS- 1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody were determined. Results showed that the HIS- 1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody <b>stained</b> <b>endogenous</b> nuclear proteins in SH-SY 5 Y cells. The stained proteins were contained within the nuclear membrane, but were not directly linked to DNA. In a histidine-tagged catalase overexpressing cell line the HIS- 1 anti-polyhistidine monoclonal antibody showed nuclear staining, whilst staining with the CAT- 505 anti-catalase monoclonal antibody showed primarily cytoplasmic staining. These results suggest that anti-polyhistidine antibody staining shows significant cross-reactivity with endogenous nuclear proteins in SH-SY 5 Y neuroblastoma cells and may not be suitable for localization studies of histidine-tagged proteins. Immunocytochemical studies with anti-polyhistidine antibodies and localization of histidine-tagged proteins must be confirmed with protein specific antibodies or other methodology...|$|R
40|$|AbstractAll 302 neurons in the C. elegans {{hermaphrodite}} arise through asymmetric {{division of}} neuroblasts. During embryogenesis, the C. elegans ham- 1 gene {{is required for}} several asymmetric neuroblast divisions in lineages that generate both neural and apoptotic cells. By antibody <b>staining,</b> <b>endogenous</b> HAM- 1 is found exclusively at the cell cortex in many cells during embryogenesis and is asymmetrically localized in dividing cells. Here we show that in transgenic embryos expressing a functional GFP::HAM- 1 fusion protein, GFP expression is also detected in the nucleus, {{in addition to the}} cell cortex. Consistent with the nuclear localization is the presence of a putative DNA binding winged-helix domain within the N-terminus of HAM- 1. Through a deletion analysis we determined that the C-terminus of the protein is required for nuclear localization and we identified two nuclear localization sequences (NLSs). A subcellular fractionation experiment from wild type embryos, followed by Western blotting, revealed that endogenous HAM- 1 is primarily found in the nucleus. Our analysis also showed that the N-terminus is necessary for cortical localization. While ham- 1 function is essential for asymmetric division in the lineage that generates the PLM mechanosensory neuron, we showed that cortical localization may not required. Thus, our results suggest that there is a nuclear function for HAM- 1 in regulating asymmetric neuroblast division and that the requirement for cortical localization may be lineage dependent...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Cell panning of phage-displayed {{antibody}} {{library is}} {{a powerful tool for}} the development of therapeutic and imaging agents since disease-related cell surface proteins in native complex conformation can be directly targeted. Here, we employed a strategy taking advantage of an integrated vector system which allows rapid conversion of scFv-displaying phage into scFv-Fc format for efficient cell-based scFv library selection on a tetraspanin protein, CD 9. Results A mouse scFv library constructed by using a phagemid vector, pDR-D 1 was subjected to cell panning against stable CD 9 transfectant, and the scFv repertoire from the enriched phage pool was directly transferred to a mammalian cassette vector, pDR-OriP-Fc 1. The resulting constructs enabled transient expression of enough amounts of scFv-Fcs in HEK 293 E cells, and flow cytometric screening of binders for CD 9 transfectant could be performed simply by using the culture supernatants. All three clones selected from the screening showed correct CD 9 -specificity. They could immunoprecipitate CD 9 molecules out of the transfectant cell lysate and correctly <b>stain</b> <b>endogenous</b> CD 9 expression on cancer cell membrane. Furthermore, competition assay with a known anti-CD 9 monoclonal antibody (mAb) suggested that the binding epitopes of some of them overlap with that of the mAb which resides within the large extracellular loop of CD 9. Conclusions This study demonstrates that scFv-Fc from mammalian transient expression can be chosen as a reliable format for rapid screening and validation in cell-based scFv library selection, and the strategy described here will be applicable to efficient discovery of antibodies to diverse cell-surface targets. </p...|$|R
40|$|Non-Melanoma {{skin cancer}} {{is the most common}} cancer in Caucasians. Accumulating {{evidence}} suggest a strong role for Î²-HPV (mainly HPV 5 and HPV 8) in the development of NMSC alongside UV, the main etiologic agent. The HPV genome encodes two potent oncoproteins, E 6 and E 7. HPV E 6 protein has been shown to inhibit mitochondrial apoptosis following UVB exposure by specifically targeting BAK, a key apoptotic protein for proteolysis. A cross talk exists between the apoptotic pathway and the cellular survival pathway, autophagy. Where both autophagy and apoptosis can be triggered by common upstream signals. Additionally, cell lacking BAK and BAX respond with autophagy following the receipt of an apoptotic stimulus. The aim of this work was to investigate if HPV E 6 may induce autophagy in response to an apoptotic stimulus. Cells expressing HPV 5 E 6 protein were exposed to UVB and autophagy levels, as well as autophagic flux, were investigated using <b>endogenous</b> LC 3 <b>staining,</b> LC 3 immunoblots and electron microscopy. Results showed an increase in autophagic flux and autophagy levels in HPV 5 E 6 expressing cells upon UV irradiation. Furthermore, the modulation of autophagy was demonstrated to be a conserved function amongst high-risk HPV (8, 20, 38 and mucosal HPV 16 and 18). Moreover, inhibition of autophagy resulted in a marked decrease in the viability of cells expressing E 6 from HPV types 5 and 8. Furthermore, examining the respiration status of HPV 5 E 6 expressing cells showed a marked increase in both the glycolytic and the oxidative phosphorylation pathways. These results indicate that HPV E 6 may promote autophagy following an apoptotic stimulus allowing the cells to survive in the background of DNA damage and that may contribute towards tumorigenesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Keloids and hypertrophic scars {{result from}} {{aberrant}} wound healing and remain a potential complication of any surgical procedure or trauma. Investigation of aberrant wound healing {{has been limited}} {{to the study of}} growth factors, collagen precursors, and DNA synthesis in simple in vitro systems, which necessitate removal or destruction of cells or factors in the growth environment of cell cultures. Multiphoton microscopy (MPM) can use endogenous chromophores such as collagen and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide hydrogenase to produce thin optical sections of thick living tissues without the use of dyes or <b>stains.</b> <b>Endogenous</b> second-harmonic-generation (SHG) signals in collagen can be collected to form an MPM image. Objective: To present a novel wound-healing model used to investigate keloid-derived fibroblast activity and collagen production in the same intact tissue-engineered construct over time. Methods: Artificial tissue constructs called RAFTs (produced by suspension of keloid or normal dermal fibroblasts in type I collagen gel with an overlying keratinocyte layer) were cultured at air-fluid interface. Multiphoton microscopy SHG images of collagen in the intact tissue constructs consisting of normal or keloid-derived fibroblasts were obtained. The constructs were then incised with a scalpel. Serial MPM and phase-contrast microscopy images were obtained to monitor changes in the extracellular matrix in response to wounding of the artificial skin construct over 8 days. Results: The tissue-engineered constructs formed a bilayer resembling the dermis and epidermis of human skin. Phase-contrast microscopy revealed migration of keratinocytes into the defect created by scalpel wounding. The constructs were found to contract with time after wounding. The MPM SHG images showed collagen deposition in the tissue constructs after wounding. Tissue constructs with keloid-derived fibroblasts were found to deposit collagen at a higher rate than those with normal fibroblasts. Conclusions: The MPM model described herein permits serial observation of the same intact specimens without the need for fixation or cytotoxic stains. Furthermore, it demonstrates the biolo gic activity of RAFT artificial tissue constructs. © 2004 American Medical Association. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{complexity}} of the mouse mu opioid receptor (Oprm) gene was demonstrated by the identification of multiple alternatively spliced variants and promoters. Our previous studies have identified a novel promoter, exon 11 (E 11) promoter, in the mouse Oprm gene. The E 11 promoter is located ~ 10 kb upstream of the exon 1 (E 1) promoter. The E 11 promoter controls the expression of nine splice variants in the mouse Oprm gene. Distinguished from the TATA-less E 1 promoter, the E 11 promoter resembles a typical TATA-containing eukaryote class II promoter. The {{aim of this study}} is to further characterize the E 11 and E 1 promoters in vivo using a transgenic mouse model. Results We constructed a ~ 20 kb transgenic construct in which a 3. 7 kb E 11 promoter region and an 8. 9 kb E 1 promoter region controlled expression of tau/LacZ and tau/GFP reporters, respectively. The construct was used to establish a transgenic mouse line. The expression of the reporter mRNAs, determined by a RT-PCR approach, in the transgenic mice during embryonic development displayed a temporal pattern similar to that of the <b>endogenous</b> promoters. X-gal <b>staining</b> for tau/LacZ reporter and GFP imaging for tau/GFP reporter showed that the transgenic E 11 and E 1 promoters were widely expressed in various regions of the central nervous system (CNS). The distribution of tau/GFP reporter in the CNS was similar to that of MOR- 1 -like immunoreactivity using an exon 4 -specific antibody. However, differential expression of both promoters was observed in some CNS regions such as the hippocampus and substantia nigra, suggesting that the E 11 and E 1 promoters were regulated differently in these regions. Conclusion We have generated a transgenic mouse line to study the E 11 and E 1 promoters in vivo using tau/LacZ and tau/GFP reporters. The reasonable relevance of the transgenic model was demonstrated by the temporal and spatial expression of the transgenes as compared to those of the endogenous transcripts. We believe that these transgenic mice will provide a useful model for further characterizing the E 11 and E 1 promoter in vivo under different physiological and pathological circumstances such as chronic opioid treatment and chronic pain models. </p...|$|R
40|$|Five {{traditional}} Chinese medicines {{were screened}} for their antiangiogenic activities through zebrafish angiogenic assay. Two of them, Tripterygium wilfordii and Rheum palmatum showed {{potential in the}} primary screening. T. wilfordii was selected in further study. In the further investigation of antiangiogenic activity of triptolide on mammal systems, triptolide showed potent activity in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) assays including proliferation, migration and tube formation assay. It inhibited HUVEC proliferation with IC 50 as low as 34 nM. It also showed more potency in HUVEC migration and tube formation assay at as low concentration as nanomolar level than SU 5416, a putative VEGFR- 2 inhibitor currently in clinic trials. RT-PCR and western blotting analysis showed that the underlying mechanism of triptolide correlated with down-regulation of VEGFR- 2 and Tie 2 expression and production. Tie 2 inhibition {{appeared to be a}} later event as compared with VEGFR- 2. Tie 2 overexpression in HUVEC could attenuate the inhibitory effect of triptolide on HUVEC proliferation. Tie 2 knockdown mimicked the inhibition activity of triptolide in tube formation assay. These phenomemon revealed that Tie 2 signaling pathway plays a crucial role in triptolide-mediated angiogenesis inhibition. In in vivo Matrigel Plug assay, triptolide showed inhibition effect at as low as 100 nM. T. wilfordii is an immune-suppressive, anti-inflammatory herb used in China for centuries. Through bioassay-guided purification, three antiangiogenic terpenoids were isolated from the ethyl acetate fraction, namely, celastrol, cangoronine and triptolide. Among them, triptolide manifested the most potent antiangiogenic activities against vessel formation. As low as 0. 31 microM, triptolide inhibited 20 % of vessel formation, and the inhibition reached a plateau of 50 % at 1. 2 microM. Celatrol reduced vessel formation by more than 30 % at 0. 62 microM, but killed 50 % of the embryos at higher concentrations. Cangoronine was much weaker, inhibiting vessel formation by 20 % at 2. 5 microM. These three components all showed stronger antiangiogenic activities than 2 -methoxyestradiol, a putative compound currently under clinical trials as an antiangiogenic agent for cancer treatment, as the latter inhibited angiogenesis in zebrafish embryos by 34 % at 10 microM. The loss of vessel formation in the embryos treated with triptolide was further confirmed using <b>endogenous</b> alkaline phosphatase <b>staining.</b> Semi-quantitative RT-PCR analysis revealed that triptolide dose- and time-dependently reduced the mRNA expression of angiopoietin (angpt 2) and tie 2 in zebrafish, indicating the involvement of angpt 2 /tie 2 signaling pathway in the antiangiogenic action of triptolide. This research revealed that zebrafish model is a promising antiangiogenic model for both the screening of antiangiogenic agents from Chinese herbal medicine and the subsequent discovery for the drug targets. Triptolide, an anti-inflammatory component from T. wilfordii, is a potent angiogenic inhibitor through targeting VEGFR- 2 and Tie 2 pathways in mammal models whereas targeting ang 2 -tie 2 pathway in zebrafish model. The anti-tumor action of triptolide was demonstrated to be partly through inhibition of tumor angiogenesis. Moreover, the potent antiangiogenic action exerted by triptolide at nanomolar dosage level gives proof that it is a promising lead compound for the development of antiangiogenic drug for cancer treatment.
