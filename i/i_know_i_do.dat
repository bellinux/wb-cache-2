6000|$|Turning to her again, he {{said with}} keen expectation, [...] "But go on. Go on! There is more to tell if you will. Be not afraid. John and <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> in any case, and shall tell you if you are right. Speak, without fear!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She is very kind, and {{you ought}} to love her very much. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I have no friend {{in the world for}} whom I have a greater regard than for Lady Lufton. It is that which makes me so happy to leave you with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The artist's?" [...] I repeated. And I laughed, frantically, wildly, gloomily, incoherently, disagreeably. I am {{sensible}} that <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|But at {{this point}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> manage a word in. [...] "I <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know!</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it all. It was I who {{suggested}} to Harold that he should lengthen the meditations, and insisted on his inviting Percy to stay." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I jumped overboard," [...] Bathurst said, laying {{his hand}} impressively upon the Doctor's shoulder. [...] "I gave a cry, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> and <b>I</b> jumped overboard." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do you not? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> I {{think that}} {{young men in}} society {{are bound to be}} agreeable, and that they should not be there if they {{do not know how to}} talk pleasantly, and to give {{something}} in return for all the trouble we take for them." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Once I thought I knew. But now I am older <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know. We have a Legend--perhaps {{it is not}} a legend. One may be a churchman and disbelieve. Stokes {{says there}} is nothing in it...." [...] The Vicar shook his head at the bananas.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{are quite}} right, Fraulein Thekla. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not look very fierce, but I hope when my {{moustache}} grows I shall come up more nearly to your expectations. As to my height, I have some years to grow yet, seeing that I am scarce eighteen, and perhaps {{no older than}} your cousin." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I reckon {{all three}} of us lost our heads when we saw that man; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> and we were so eager to get on shore that we paid no {{attention}} to anything else. Have you seen him?" ...|$|R
60|$|I {{dare say}} <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong--indeed, judging by later events, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> wrong. But <b>I</b> could not view the affair seriously {{enough to hold}} out against Mr. Engelman {{in the matter of}} the nosegay. He started when I {{mentioned}} the widow's name.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{it was n't}} a lie," [...] Punch would begin, {{charging}} into a laboured {{explanation that}} landed him more hopelessly in the mire. [...] "I said that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't say my prayers twice over in the day, and that was on Tuesday. Once <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> but Harry said <b>I</b> <b>did</b> n't," [...] and so forth, till the tension brought tears, and he was dismissed from the table in disgrace.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope so, sir. I think I {{can swim}} or run or fight {{any of the}} chaps of my own age in the school; but <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> look girlish about the face. I have done {{everything}} I could to make my face rough. I have sat in the sun, and wetted it with sea-water every five minutes, but it's no use." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, Philip," [...] she said, {{with her}} childish contrition {{when he used}} to chide her, [...] "you are right, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> always think too much of my own feelings, and not enough of others',--not enough of yours. I had need have you always to find fault with me and teach me; so many things have come true that you used to tell me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; of course; <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not like}} to trouble you with my private affairs;--there is nothing, I think, so bad as washing one's dirty linen in public;--but the truth is, that I am only now free from the rapacity of the De Courcys. You would hardly believe me if I told you what I've had to pay. What {{do you think of}} two hundred and forty-five pounds for {{bringing}} her body over here, and burying it at De Courcy?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{continued}} {{along the}} bridge to the forecastle head and purposely remained there half an hour ere I returned to the cabin {{by way of the}} main deck. Although <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not analyze my motive, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> not desire any one to <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> had overheard the occurrence.|$|R
6000|$|... "No more <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> wish <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> [...] And <b>I</b> {{would tell}} {{it all to}} you; [...] For what became of this poor child [...] There's none that ever knew." ...|$|R
60|$|I wasted my substance, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> On riotous living, so <b>I</b> <b>did,</b> But there's {{nothing on}} record to show <b>I</b> <b>did</b> Worse than my betters have done. They {{talk of the}} money I spent out there-- They hint at the pace that I went out there-- But they all forget I was sent out there Alone as a rich man's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I know Mrs. Wilmot thinks I spoil my class. She {{spoke to}} me about making favourites, and {{sometimes}} has seemed surprised at things which I have done. Last Sunday {{she told me she}} thought I had better have a steadier class, and I know whom she will give me--the great big, stupid ones, {{at the bottom of the}} first class! I do believe it is only out of good-nature that she does not tell me not to teach at all. I have a great mind I will not; <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> nothing but harm." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not exaggerate, unconsciously and unintentionally, the scantiness of my {{resources}} or {{the difficulties of}} my life. I know that if a shilling were given me by Mr. Quinion at any time, I spent it in a dinner or a tea. I know that I worked, from morning until night, with common men and boys, a shabby child. I know that I lounged about the streets, insufficiently and unsatisfactorily fed. I know that, but for the mercy of God, I might easily have been, for any care that was taken of me, a little robber or a little vagabond.|$|E
6000|$|... "Honoria," [...] {{repeated}} Ives, [...] "you must hear me. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{not deserve}} your forgiveness, but I must have it. There is a madness that possesses one sometimes for which his better nature is not responsible. I throw everything else but {{you to the}} winds. I strike off the chains that have bound me. I renounce the siren that lured me from you. Let the bought verse of that street peddler plead for me. It is you only whom I can love. Let your love forgive, and I swear to you that mine will be true 'as long as skies above are blue.'" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> hardly <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> <b>know</b> this--that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> more towards refusing {{him than}} {{accepting}} him; that I must {{have much more}} love for any man <b>I</b> <b>do</b> marry than <b>I</b> have for him at present; and that after what has passed, I think we had better not go to Damascus together." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, they didn't like it much, but I {{think most}} of them had a respect for him. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> He has a whole lot of assurance, an air of knowing what he's talking about, and {{apparently}} he doesn't give a continental whether he's popular or not. Besides, Greenhalge had cracked him up to the skies for the work he'd done for the school board." ...|$|R
60|$|Lov. How {{the devil}} <b>do</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that? <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not {{conceive}} myself, under correction, so inconsiderable a person.|$|R
6000|$|... "We {{have been}} {{partners}} {{from the day}} the Petite Jeanne went down," [...] he said at last. [...] "But if your heart so wishes, then shall we become partners by the law. I have no work to do, yet are my expenses large. I drink and eat and smoke in plenty--it costs much, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not pay for the playing of billiards, for I play on your table; but still the money goes. Fishing on the reef is only a rich man's pleasure. It is shocking, the cost of hooks and cotton line. Yes; {{it is necessary that}} we be partners by the law. I need the money. I shall get it from the head clerk in the office." ...|$|E
6000|$|She brooded {{over her}} linked fingers. [...] "Oh, <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> {{go and get}} mean sometimes, and I'm sorry afterwards. But, oh, Georgie, Paul is so aggravating! Honestly, I've tried awfully hard, these last few years, {{to be nice to}} him, but just because I used to be spiteful--or I seemed so; I wasn't, really, but I used to speak up and say {{anything}} that came into my head--and so he made up his mind that everything was my fault. Everything can't always be my fault, can it? And now if I get to fussing, he just turns silent, oh, so dreadfully silent, and he won't look at me--he just ignores me. He simply isn't human! And he deliberately keeps it up till I bust out and say a lot of things I don't mean. So silent--Oh, you righteous men! How wicked you are! How rotten wicked!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I saw {{him again}} when he was driving a milk-wagon. He {{delivered}} milk at a friend's house where I chanced to be. The last time I saw him was at my father's home. He had obtained employment in my father's plant as an efficiency expert. He seemed to exercise some strange power over father, who believed implicitly in him, until recently, when he evidently commenced to have doubts; for the night {{that the man was}} at our house I was sitting in the music-room when they passed through the hallway, and I heard father discharge him. But the fellow pleaded to be retained, and finally father promised to keep him for a while longer, as I recall it, at least until certain work was completed at the plant. This work was completed yesterday. That's all <b>I</b> <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not know whether father discharged him again or not." ...|$|E
5000|$|In 2011 and 2013 Tinning {{was again}} denied parole. At the 2011 appearance, Tinning {{said that she}} killed Tami Lynne because she thought the child would die like her other {{children}} anyway. In 2011, Tinning was supported by people from Georgetown University Law Center and people she worked with in prison, describing her as the [...] "most loving, most generous, caring person that they have ever met." [...] When questioned about the murder during her 2013 appearance, she said, [...] "It’s just — I can’t remember. <b>I</b> mean, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> it, but <b>I</b> can’t tell you why. There is no reason." ...|$|R
5000|$|Roughly half a {{year before}} the episode aired, J. M. DeMatteis commented [...] "I have a feeling that the show that appears will not bear much {{relation}} to what I wrote. What I've found out is that this season—unlike last, where the script was pretty much regarded as sacrosanct—the network is really interfering a lot. ... Regardless, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did</b> a good job and it was a real satisfying experience." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm not {{indifferent}} about it, my dear. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> <b>did</b> right, but <b>I</b> don't <b>know</b> that <b>I</b> could <b>do</b> {{right under}} the same circumstances again." ...|$|R
60|$|You know I {{have never}} quite {{believed}} in myself, never quite believed {{in my work}} or my religion. So {{it has always been}} with me and always, I suppose, will be. I know I am purblind, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> not see my way clearly nor very far; I have to do with things imperfectly apprehended. I cannot cheat my mind away from these convictions. I have a sort of hesitation of the soul as other men have a limp in their gait. God, I suppose, has a need for lame men. God, I suppose, has a need for blind men and fearful and doubting men, and does not intend life to be altogether swallowed up in staring sight. Some things are to be reached best by a hearing that is not distracted by any clearer senses. But so it is with me, and this is the innermost secret I have to tell you.|$|E
6000|$|... "Why, {{to own the}} truth," [...] cried Miss Bates, who {{had been}} trying in vain to be heard the last two minutes, [...] "if I must speak on this subject, {{there is no denying}} that Mr. Frank Churchill might have--I do not mean to say that he did not dream it--I am sure I have {{sometimes}} the oddest dreams in the world--but if I am questioned about it, I must acknowledge that there was such an idea last spring; for Mrs. Perry herself mentioned it to my mother, and the Coles knew of it as well as ourselves--but it was quite a secret, known to nobody else, and only thought of about three days. Mrs. Perry was very anxious that he should have a carriage, and came to my mother in great spirits one morning because she thought she had prevailed. Jane, don't you remember grandmama's telling us of it when we got home? I forget where we had been walking to--very likely to Randalls; yes, I think it was to Randalls. Mrs. Perry was always particularly fond of my mother--indeed I do not know who is not--and she had mentioned it to her in confidence; she had no objection to her telling us, of course, but it was not to go beyond: and, from that day to this, I never mentioned it to a soul that I know of. At the same time, I will not positively answer for my having never dropt a hint, because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do</b> sometimes pop out a thing before I am aware. I am a talker, you know; I am rather a talker; and now and then I have let a thing escape me which I should not. I am not like Jane; I wish I were. I will answer for it she never betrayed the least thing in the world. Where is she?--Oh! just behind. Perfectly remember Mrs. Perry's coming.--Extraordinary dream, indeed!" ...|$|E
5000|$|... "Some {{people ask}} me why I always wear a crown’ on my head she told Popstar {{magazine}} [...] "You know, it’s a reminder to keep my head up and stay focused. A {{lot of people will}} tell you that you are not good enough, we say this to ourselves sometimes (<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>do)</b> I’ve also experienced bullying and I’m not ashamed to say it hurts, so my crown keeps my head high ...|$|E
60|$|I think {{everyone}} {{expected to see}} a man emerge--possibly something a little unlike us terrestrial men, but in all essentials a man. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> But, looking, <b>I</b> presently saw something stirring within the shadow: greyish billowy movements, one above another, and then two luminous disks--like eyes. Then something resembling a little grey snake, about the thickness of a walking stick, coiled up out of the writhing middle, and wriggled in the air towards me--and then another.|$|R
60|$|Aunt {{went to bed}} {{soon after}} supper, leaving the local curate, old Dr. Scrubbles, Mr. Samuel Coombes, our member of the County Council, Teddy Biffles, and myself to keep Uncle company. We {{agreed that it was}} too early to give in for some time yet, so Uncle brewed another bowl of punch; and I think we all did justice to that--at least <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>did.</b> It is a passion with me, is the desire to do justice.|$|R
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> God <b>knows</b> <b>I</b> <b>do.</b> <b>I</b> {{would tell}} you everything. I would indeed.
