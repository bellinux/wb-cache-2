Once Ben Gurion had asked me—what do I think of the decision to appoint Dayan as the Minister of Agriculture in his government. I said that it is important that Dayan sits in every government because of his brilliant mind—but never as prime minister. Ben Gurion asked: [...] "why not as prime minister?". I replied then: [...] "because he does not accept responsibility".|$|E
2500|$|Scott-Heron {{admitted}} ambivalence {{regarding his}} association with rap, remarking in 2010 in an interview for the Daily Swarm: [...] "I don't know if I can take the blame for [...] ". As New York Times writer Sisario explained, he preferred the moniker of [...] "bluesologist". Referring to reviews of his last album and references {{to him as the}} [...] "godfather of rap", Scott-Heron said: [...] "It's something that's aimed at the kids ... I have kids, so I listen to it. But <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> it's aimed at me. I listen to the jazz station." [...] In 2013, Chattanooga rapper Isaiah Rashad recorded an unofficial mixtape called Pieces of a Kid, which was greatly influenced by Heron's debut album Pieces of a Man.|$|E

Of course I know {{appearances}} are against me, and I can't tell you what really happened: But my children are at school, and they'll be coming home--and I don't know what they'll do without me.|$|R
60|$|Before I {{reached the}} house that afternoon, Euphemia rushed out to tell this story. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> like to <b>say</b> how far I kicked those ham-bones.|$|R
6000|$|My friends, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> this, unless I {{could say}} more. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> sad words, if I could not follow them up by joyful and hopeful ones.

6000|$|... "I was {{thinking}} so myself, Wulf, though <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> it; {{but in truth}} I think the risks we may run in making our way to Rouen are small compared to those of staying here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... ‘We-e-ell!’ {{said the}} Dean, {{in a more}} {{confidential}} tone, and slightly glancing around him, ‘I would not say so, generally. Not generally. Enough of suspicion attaches to him to—no, I think <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>not</b> <b>say</b> so, generally.’ ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Let us {{get back}} to camp," [...] said the Master. [...] "I have an {{explanation}} to make, {{but it must be}} laid before you all.

6000|$|She hesitated, {{but only}} for a brief moment, then did just what he asked. She held her hand to his lips, mayhap one second longer than was {{absolutely}} necessary, and her eyes, large, deep and shy, looked for that one second into a pair of merry, mocking ones.

60|$|DOCTOR. Forgive me, but may I detain you for one moment?

But here {{at least there was}} no feminine softness, no tenderness in the eye, no young shame at being gazed at. She paused for a moment in her work, and gave back to them all the look they gave her; and then, as though they were beneath her notice, she strained once more at her task, and so dropped the linen to the ground.|$|R
5000|$|Ripley {{has been}} {{critically}} acclaimed for being [...] "both a likable character and a cold-blooded killer".
