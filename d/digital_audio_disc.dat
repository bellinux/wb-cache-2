25|$|As a result, in 1979, Sony and Philips {{set up a}} joint {{task force}} of {{engineers}} to design a new <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc.</b> Led by engineers Kees Schouhamer Immink and Toshitada Doi, the research pushed forward laser and optical disc technology. After a year of experimentation and discussion, the task force produced the Red Book CD-DA standard. First published in 1980, the standard was formally adopted by the IEC as an international standard in 1987, with various amendments {{becoming part of the}} standard in 1996.|$|E
25|$|In 1974, L. Ottens, {{director}} of the audio division of Philips, started a small group with the aim to develop an analog optical audio disc with a diameter of 20cm and a sound quality superior {{to that of the}} vinyl record. However, due to the unsatisfactory performance of the analog format, two Philips research engineers recommended a digital format in March 1974. In 1977, Philips then established a laboratory with the mission of creating a <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc.</b> The diameter of Philips's prototype compact disc was set at 11.5cm, the diagonal of an audio cassette.|$|E
25|$|Prototypes were {{developed}} by Philips and Sony independently in the late 1970s. Although originally dismissed by Philips Research management as a trivial pursuit, the CD became the primary focus for Philips as the LaserDisc format struggled. In 1979, Sony and Philips set up a joint task force of engineers to design a new <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc.</b> After a year of experimentation and discussion, the Red Book CD-DA standard was published in 1980. After their commercial release in 1982, compact discs and their players were extremely popular. Despite costing up to $1,000, over 400,000 CD players were sold in the United States between 1983 and 1984. By 1988 CD sales in the United States surpassed those of vinyl LPs, and by 1992 CD sales surpassed those of prerecorded music cassette tapes. The success of the compact disc has been credited to the cooperation between Philips and Sony, who came together to agree upon and develop compatible hardware. The unified design of the compact disc allowed consumers to purchase any disc or player from any company, and allowed the CD to dominate the at-home music market unchallenged.|$|E
50|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>audio</b> compact <b>discs</b> (using PCM) were {{introduced}} in 1982. Starting in 1985, the medium was adapted for the storage of computer data via the Yellow Book CD-ROM standard and the High Sierra Format (which evolved in ISO 9660).|$|R

Sony first publicly demonstrated an optical <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc</b> in September 1976. A year later, in September 1977, Sony showed the press a 30cm disc that could play 60 minutes of digital audio (44,100Hz sampling rate and 16-bit resolution) using MFM modulation. In September 1978, the company demonstrated an optical <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc</b> with a 150-minute playing time, 44,056Hz sampling rate, 16-bit linear resolution, and cross-interleaved error correction code—specifications similar to those later settled upon for the standard compact disc format in 1980. Technical details of Sony's <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>disc</b> were presented during the 62nd AES Convention, held on 13–16 March 1979, in Brussels.

[...] Sony replied that Greatest Hits titles must be the same as the original release version. [...] Dismayed, Wiklem burned a copy of the original version and sent it to Sony for duplication. [...] Due to a mixup in the duplication process, the modified version of the game was duplicated and not the original version. [...] Sony <b>Digital</b> <b>Audio</b> <b>Disc</b> Corporation contacted Sony Computer Entertainment about the mix up, and eventually the discussions trickled down to Wiklem himself.
