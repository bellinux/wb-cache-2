5|$|The Kings' sagas {{include a}} rather {{elliptical}} but widely studied account {{of an early}} Swedish king being worshipped after his death and being called Ólafr Geirstaðaálfr ('Ólafr the <b>elf</b> of Geirstaðir'), and a demonic <b>elf</b> {{at the beginning of}} Norna-Gests þáttr.|$|E
5|$|Both “The <b>Elf</b> Child” and “Where Is Mary Alice Smith?” {{were printed}} in book {{form for the}} first time in 1885 in The Boss Girl.|$|E
5|$|In {{the film}} version of The Hobbit, McKenzie was cast as Lindir, an <b>elf</b> of Rivendell who {{appeared}} briefly in J.R.R. Tolkien's novel, The Fellowship of the Ring.|$|E
5000|$|There are {{numerous}} different subraces and subcultures of <b>elves,</b> including aquatic <b>elves,</b> dark <b>elves</b> (drow), deep <b>elves</b> (rockseer), grey <b>elves,</b> high <b>elves,</b> moon <b>elves,</b> snow <b>elves,</b> sun <b>elves,</b> valley <b>elves,</b> wild <b>elves</b> (grugach), wood <b>elves</b> and winged <b>elves</b> (avariel). The offspring {{of humans and}} <b>elves</b> are known as [...] "half-elves" [...] among humans, and as [...] "half-humans" [...] among <b>elves.</b>|$|R
50|$|High <b>elves</b> are {{distinguished}} from other fantasy <b>elves</b> by {{their place of}} living, as they usually dwell in stone cities, instead of woods, like wood-elves. High <b>elves</b> and dark <b>elves</b> {{can be used to}} contrast respectively the good <b>elves</b> and the evil <b>elves,</b> as done in Warhammer. Typically high <b>elves</b> consider themselves the most purely good race of all, and haughtily view all other races beneath them, especially other elven races, and they are usually the most magically developed of all <b>elves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Wood Elves, Copper Elves, or Sylvan Elves (Or-Tel'Quessir): Wood <b>elves</b> are a reclusive subrace, {{preferring to}} live {{in such areas as}} the High Forest. They place more {{emphasis}} on strength than learning. Wood <b>elves</b> are considered by other elven subraces (particularly the austere sun <b>elves)</b> to be boisterous and hedonistic. They have a zest for life and pleasure. According to Races of Faerûn (which was published in March 2003 and only mentions aquatic <b>elves,</b> avariel, drow, lythari, moon <b>elves,</b> sun <b>elves,</b> wood <b>elves,</b> and wild <b>elves),</b> wood <b>elves</b> are the only elven subrace that is native to Toril. They slowly formed for centuries from some of the other elven subraces after the last Crown War. They see their realms as the natural successors to past nations such as Eaerlann and Cormanthyr. In 4th edition, wood <b>elves</b> are <b>elves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Murtagh becomes Eragon's new {{companion}} and {{they travel to}} the city Gil'ead to find {{information on how to}} find the Varden, a group of rebels who want to see the downfall of Galbatorix. While stopping near Gil'ead, Eragon is captured and imprisoned in the same jail that holds a woman he has been having dreams about. As she is being dragged past she is revealed as an <b>elf</b> when her pointed ears are uncovered. Murtagh and Saphira stage a rescue, and Eragon escapes with the unconscious <b>elf.</b> During the escape, Eragon and Murtagh battle with Durza. Murtagh shoots Durza between the eyes with an arrow, and the Shade disappears in a cloud of mist. Having escaped, they run off. Eragon succeeds in communicating with the <b>elf,</b> whose name is revealed as Arya, and learns the location of the Varden. After some arguing, Murtagh decides to still travel with Eragon to the Varden but is still wary of them.|$|E
5|$|That year, Dinklage also {{starred in}} several Off-Broadway productions, such as Richard III. Dinklage {{appeared}} in the Christmas comedy film <b>Elf</b> as Miles Finch, an irritable children's author who beats up Buddy Hobbs (Will Ferrell) after he mistakes him for an <b>elf.</b> In 2005, he starred in the short-lived CBS science fiction series Threshold and appeared as a wedding planner in the comedy film The Baxter. He also made an appearance in the adventure comedy-drama Lassie as a traveling circus performer. The film received highly positive reviews, though it did not fare well at the box office.|$|E

50|$|In Tolkien's {{writings}} the <b>elves</b> {{have been}} divided in several subgroups described in English as high <b>elves,</b> light-elves, fair-elves, deep <b>elves,</b> sea-elves, green-elves, wood-elves (sylvan <b>elves),</b> dark <b>elves,</b> grey-elves, {{and the special}} category half-elves. In the languages of the Elves there are additional subgroups under the above categories.|$|R
50|$|Additional non-good elven types {{created for}} this setting include the snow <b>elves,</b> valley <b>elves,</b> and wild (grugach) <b>elves.</b>|$|R
50|$|Half-elves and {{divergent}} {{races of}} <b>elves,</b> {{such as high}} <b>elves</b> and dark <b>elves,</b> were also popularized at this time; in particular, the evil drow of Dungeons & Dragons have inspired the dark <b>elves</b> of many other works of fantasy.|$|R
5|$|A sequel, Thor: The Dark World, {{directed}} by Alan Taylor, {{was released on}} November 8, 2013. Hemsworth and Hiddleston reprise their roles as Thor and Loki, respectively, along with others from the first film. Christopher Eccleston joins the cast as the Dark <b>Elf</b> Maletkith.|$|E
5|$|After {{the medieval}} period, the word <b>elf</b> tended to become less common {{throughout}} the Germanic languages, losing out to alternative native terms like zwerc ("dwarf") in German and huldra ("hidden being") in Scandinavian languages, and to loan-words like fairy (borrowed from French {{into all the}} Germanic languages). Still, beliefs in elves persisted in the early modern period, particularly in Scotland and Scandinavia, where elves were thought of as magically powerful people living, usually invisibly, alongside everyday human communities. They continued {{to be associated with}} causing illness and with sexual threats. For example, a number of early modern ballads in the British Isles and Scandinavia, originating in the medieval period, describe elves attempting to seduce or abduct human characters. With urbanisation and industrialisation in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries, beliefs in elves declined rapidly (though Iceland has some claim to continued popular belief in elves). However, from the early modern period onwards, elves started to be prominent in the literature and art of educated elites. These literary elves were imagined as small, impish beings, with Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream being a key development of this idea. In the eighteenth century, German Romanticist writers were influenced by this notion of the <b>elf,</b> and reimported the English word <b>elf</b> into the German language.|$|E
5|$|By 1915 when Tolkien {{was writing}} his first elven poems, the words <b>elf,</b> fairy and gnome had many {{divergent}} and contradictory associations. Tolkien had been gently warned against {{using the term}} 'fairy', which John Garth supposes {{may have been due}} to the word becoming increasingly used to indicate homosexuality, although despite this warning Tolkien continued to use it.|$|E
50|$|The {{history of}} the elven race is marked by great empires and a gradual decline and retreat from the {{mainland}} Faerûn. The <b>elves</b> first came to Abeir-Toril from the plane of Faerie more than twenty-five millennia ago. The first wave of <b>elves</b> to arrive were the green <b>elves,</b> lythari, and avariel. The second wave included the dark <b>elves,</b> who arrived in the jungles of southern Faerûn, and the sun and moon <b>elves,</b> who arrived in the north. Not long after, the aquatic <b>elves</b> arrived in the Great Sea. After the second wave of elven immigrants arrived, the Time of Dragons ended and the period known as the First Flowering of the Fair Folk began. The <b>elves</b> settled into five major civilizations along the west and south of Faerûn during this period. Along the Sword Coast, the sun <b>elves</b> established Aryvandaar and Shantel Othreier, and the green <b>elves</b> established Illefarn, Miyeritar (along with the dark <b>elves),</b> and Keltormir. To the south, in present-day Vilhon Reach, the green <b>elves</b> also created the nations of Thearnytaar, Eiellûr, and Syòpiir. In the forests that once covered the Shaar, the moon <b>elves</b> established Orishaar, and the dark <b>elves</b> established Ilythiir and Miyeritar (along with the green <b>elves).</b> All of these realms were gradually destroyed {{as a result of}} the Crown Wars, which made way for other elven realms.|$|R
50|$|Half-elves are the {{offspring}} of humans and <b>elves.</b> They look like <b>elves</b> to humans and like humans to <b>elves.</b> Half-Elves have curiosity and ambitions like humans but they have sense for magic and love for nature like their elven parents. Their skin is paler than human skin and they are taller and bigger than <b>elves.</b> Half-Elves have long ears like <b>elves.</b> They live about 180 years.|$|R
50|$|Wild Elves or Green Elves (Sy-Tel'Quessir): The most reclusive {{of all the}} <b>elves,</b> {{the wild}} <b>elves</b> pride {{themselves}} on their isolation and skill at keeping hidden. Their skin tends to be brown and they have similar colored hair which lightens with age. In 4th edition, wild <b>elves</b> are <b>elves.</b>|$|R
5|$|Círdan (Shipwright) is the epessë of a Telerin <b>Elf</b> who {{remained}} in Beleriand, and later Lindon, {{until the end of}} the Third Age. His original name was only rarely remembered in traditions as Nōwē, and he was referred to always as Círdan, a title which had been given to him as Lord of the Falas.|$|E
5|$|Early modern English {{notions of}} elves became {{influential}} in eighteenth-century Germany. The Modern German <b>Elf</b> (m) and Elfe (f) was introduced as a loan-word from English in the 1740s and was prominent in Christoph Martin Wieland's 1764 translation of A Midsummer Night's Dream.|$|E
5|$|From {{around the}} Late Middle Ages, the word <b>elf</b> {{began to be}} used in English as a term loosely synonymous with the French loan-word fairy; in elite art and literature, at least, it also became {{associated}} with diminutive supernatural beings like Puck, hobgoblins, Robin Goodfellow, the English and Scots brownie, and the Northumbrian English hob.|$|E
50|$|Subraces of <b>elves</b> include Dark Elves and Deep <b>elves.</b>|$|R
5000|$|High <b>elves,</b> a list {{of light}} <b>elves</b> from other fantasy {{settings}} ...|$|R
500|$|Beliefs in <b>elves</b> causing illness {{remained}} {{prominent in}} early modern Scotland, where <b>elves</b> {{were viewed as}} being supernaturally powerful people who lived invisibly alongside everyday rural people. Thus, <b>elves</b> were often mentioned in the early modern Scottish witchcraft trials: many witnesses in the trials believed themselves to have been given healing powers or to know of people or animals made sick by <b>elves.</b> Throughout these sources, <b>elves</b> are sometimes associated with the succuba-like supernatural being called the mare.|$|R
5|$|Holly Short– A determined, forthright <b>elf</b> and {{the first}} female captain of LEPrecon. Compassionate and caring, she goes as far as healing Butler from fatal wounds {{sustained}} fighting a troll, {{even though he has}} been integral in the plan to hold her hostage—this act is the first step to changing Artemis' attitude and conscience.|$|E
5|$|If a human {{watched the}} dance of the elves, he would {{discover}} that even though {{only a few hours}} seemed to have passed, many years had passed in the real world. Humans being invited or lured to the <b>elf</b> dance is a common motif transferred from older Scandinavian ballads.|$|E
5|$|In 1995, Schumacher and Williams driver David Coulthard were disqualified {{for fuel}} irregularities, after a switch to Renault engines and <b>Elf</b> oils. On appeal, both drivers had their results and points reinstated, but both teams lost the points {{the results would}} {{normally}} have earned in the Constructors' Championship.|$|E
50|$|The game's {{character}} options {{consist of}} nine playable character races, each {{with their own}} advantages and disadvantages. The playable races are: humans, <b>elves,</b> halflings, half-giants, dwarves, wild <b>elves,</b> dark <b>elves,</b> goblins and catfolk.|$|R
50|$|Modern fantasy {{literature}} has revived the <b>elves</b> as {{a race of}} semi-divine beings of human stature who are friendly with nature and animals. Although the álfar of Norse mythology has influenced the concept of <b>elves</b> in fantasy, the <b>elves</b> are different from Norse and the traditional <b>elves</b> found in Middle Ages folklore and Victorian era literature.|$|R
50|$|As for {{traditional}} races, <b>elves</b> are relative {{newcomers to the}} continent of Khorvaire. Originally the <b>elves</b> were slaves to a race of giants on the continent of Xen'drik. They escaped to and founded a nation on the smaller continent of Aerenal. Aerenal <b>elves</b> in Eberron practice a form of ancestor worship. On Aerenal, those <b>elves</b> deemed to be particularly beneficial to the race are magically revived as Undying. The lich-like beings are enchanted with positive energy instead of the negative energy that animates undead. The Undying act as counselors to the Aerenal <b>elves.</b> Elves have occupied parts of Khorvaire sporadically, only recently forming their own nation there known as Valenar. Valenar <b>elves</b> hold different traditions from Aerenal <b>elves,</b> and stress bringing glory to their Xen'drik ancestors through combat.|$|R
5|$|In {{order to}} protect {{themselves}} and their livestock against malevolent elves, Scandinavians could use a so-called <b>Elf</b> cross (Alfkors, Älvkors or Ellakors), which was carved into buildings or other objects. It existed in two shapes, one was a pentagram {{and it was still}} frequently used in early 20th-century Sweden as painted or carved onto doors, walls and household utensils in {{order to protect}} against elves. The second form was an ordinary cross carved onto a round or oblong silver plate. This second kind of <b>elf</b> cross was worn as a pendant in a necklace and in order to have sufficient magic it had to be forged during three evenings with silver, from nine different sources of inherited silver. In some locations it also had to be on the altar of a church for three consecutive Sundays.|$|E
5|$|Play-Doh {{packaging}} {{was briefly}} illustrated {{with children in}} the mid-1950s, but replaced by an <b>elf</b> mascot which, in 1960, was superseded by Play-Doh Pete, a smock and beret-wearing cartoonish boy. In 2002, Play-Doh Pete's beret was replaced with a baseball cap. Since 2011, living Play-Doh cans named the Doh-Dohs have been seen in adverts.|$|E
5|$|Salvatore uses Drizzt to {{represent}} issues of racial prejudice, particularly in The Dark <b>Elf</b> Trilogy. For instance, Drizzt {{is concerned that}} if he and his love Cattie-Brie (a human) have children, their offspring will face hostility from both races. Drizzt is also troubled by the lifespan discrepancy between himself and Cattie-Brie.|$|E
50|$|The Snowman, and his minions started invading Santa's Village, but Santa {{sent his}} <b>elves</b> to fight back, {{starting}} a chaotic battle. The <b>elves,</b> and the snowman minions fought tirelessly. The <b>elves</b> {{were attempting to}} melt, and blow up the snowman minions while the snowman minions were freezing, and spewing out snowballs at the <b>elves.</b> As the battle rage on, neither was claiming an easy victory, but Santa knew that the conflict had to end. Christmas was only hours away! So, Santa decided {{to take matters into}} his own hands by going to help his <b>elves</b> end the conflict. But when Santa came to the battle, The Snowman unleashed a snow monster. However, Santa managed to defeat the monster by using a heating item to shrink the monster. Just when it looked like The Snowman was about to surrender to Santa, and the <b>elves,</b> more of his minions came to outnumber Santa, and the <b>elves.</b> With that, Santa, and his <b>elves</b> were imprisoned.|$|R
50|$|Blood <b>elves</b> have a usually peachy {{skin tone}} and green glowing eyes. They {{also have a}} gift for magic, with a long and troubled history of magical {{addiction}} and arcane practices. The blood <b>elves</b> {{can be divided into}} three distinct political factions: the playable Thalassian <b>elves</b> allied with the Horde, the Illidari <b>elves</b> in Outland loyal to Kael'thas, and the Scryers, a group of Kael'thas' <b>elves</b> who rebelled and fled to Shattrath City to seek refuge with the naaru. They are led by Voren'thal the Seer.|$|R
50|$|Moon Elves or Silver Elves (Teu-Tel'Quessir): The moon <b>elves</b> are {{the most}} common of all the <b>elves</b> in Faerûn and are also known as silver <b>elves.</b> They {{typically}} have fair skin and hair that runs in hues from silver-white to black or blue. While human style hair colors are rare, eye color can be remarkably similar, with colors ranging from blue to green. The majority of the half-elves in Faerûn come from parings between humans and moon <b>elves.</b> In 4th edition, moon <b>elves</b> are eladrin.|$|R
