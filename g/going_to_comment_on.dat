5000|$|In the {{aftermath}} of this controversy, Labour turned its attack on the campaign of the Liberal candidate, accusing George Suggett of trying to smear Giles Radice personally and of trying to capitalise unfairly on the nomination issue. At the declaration of the votes, Radice announced that whereas the Conservatives had conducted a clean and honest campaign, he was not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> the approach of his other opponent. As Suggett tried to make his speech after the declaration he was constantly heckled and jeered by the Labour supporters, who were later silent for the speech of Neil Balfour. Suggett denied he had smeared Radice and invited the press to review his election literature and campaign speeches for any evidence of misconduct. He said the real reason was so angry was that the Liberals had “broken the weighbridge on which the Labour majority in Chester-le-Street used to be weighed.” [...] Cyril Smith, who had campaigned for Suggett in the by-election, recalled later that he deliberately, if obliquely, had {{raised the issue of}} political corruption by mentioning in a speech {{at the opening of the}} campaign the T. Dan Smith affair and how it was uncovering new instances of corruption amongst Labour councillors in the North East, including one from Chester-le-Street who later went to prison. As far as the Liberal Party was concerned, commented Smith, this was legitimate political meat and needed no apology.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} I {{am going to}} analyze the impact of Chinese culture on the Japanese modern writer Mori Ogai (actual name Mori Rintaro, 1862 - 1922). Ogai, along with Natsume Soseki (1867 - 1916), is {{regarded}} as one of the preeminent writers of the Meiji period. The article starts by reconsidering the impact of Ogai's early training in the Chinese Classics on the literature of his mature years. When reading Chinese literature, Ogai based his interest on a wide variety of literary works, sometimes even wider than that of the scholars of the preceeding Tokugawa period. One of the reasons why Meiji writers were able to pick up selected readings among such numerous variety is that since the introduction of Western thought in Japan, intellectuals had formally changed the way they judged the value of literary works, and this would, in turn, work towards influencing favourably the process of rediscovery of forgotten Chinese and Japanese works. Ogai thoroughly worked towards broadening his knowledge of Chinese and Japanese literature, along with the study of Western fonts. I am going to present a series of texts by Ōgai that demonstrate his interest in Chinese studies. I am going to use these examples to discuss how Ogai’s outlook on Chinese literature changed over time, to the point that he developed a more mature approach to the study of Chinese culture, and Chinese language itself. He was not entirely alone in this, as his views on Chinese literature were partly shared by some scholars belonging to the same literary circle, and costantly participating in the very same forums, such as Mori Kainan (1863 - 1911) and Koda Rohan (1867 - 1947), another well-known novelist of the period and acclaimed scholar of Chinese. The material I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on,</b> such as the forums called Hyoshinryo Iroku (‘Scattered Recordings on Notable Works’), transcribed and printed on literary magazines, clearly show that Meiji intellectuals used to hold literary debates on subjects drawn from alternatively Western, Japanese and Chinese sources; this tendency to rely on sources from both Western and Asian tradition is evident in several other critical essays of Ogai, which I shall summarize throughout this article. Lastly, I will bring two concrete examples revealing how his knowledge of the Chinese language and culture enabled the author to derive literary themes and techniques from Chinese fiction. These are the short stories Yasui Fujin (‘The Wife of Yasui’), and Gyogenki (‘Yu Xuanji’) ...|$|E
40|$|Much fuss {{is being}} made these days (and has been made for years) about the {{electronic}} virtual. Prophets {{say that we have}} entered the new millennium ahead of time and that it will be electronic heaven. To quote Pierre LÃ©vy, one of the most prominenet harbingers of such a perspective: "Virtual worlds will be instruments of self-knowledge and self-definition for humanity [ [...] . ] They are home to the `angelic bodies' (or virtual images) of the members of collective intellects. "(1) - Many questions come to mind. To raise just one: Who will have such an `angelic body'? Will, for example, people in the poor regions of this world be part of these collective intellects, once they no longer lack electronic equipment? Will the Pentecostal miracle - already dreamt of by Marshall McLuhan(2) - include everybody? I'm afraid "the light of virtual worlds" which Pierre LÃ©vy believes will "illuminate and enrich human intelligence"(3) will be a partial light only - partial in shining for only a minority of humankind, and partial in being light in one aspect alone and close to darkness in another. Other diagnoses oppose the angelic prospect. They present instead an apocalyptic assessment of our electronic future. To quote Jean Baudrillard: "Virtuality aims only for prostitution, for the extinction of the real by its double. "(4) I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>comment</b> <b>on</b> this understanding of prostitution. Rather I will limit myself to stressing that angelic and apocalyptic assessments aren't that different from each other. They certainly sound different, but the underlying diagnosis is quite similar: we are said to be facing a total change, everything will be electronically transformed, nothing will remain as it was. (5) This totalizing feature can then be spelt out apocalyptically when seen from the viewpoint of good old reality, and angelically when regarded from that of a glorious future. A third group of people tries to take up a sort of middle position between the extremes by saying that today reality and virtuality are simply becoming equivalent so that in each case the term `virtuality' can be replaced by the term `reality' and vice versa - and that doing so is the hallmark of progressive thinking. But this alleged middle position, I'm afraid, is just as one-sided as are the angelic and the apocalyptic ones. The diagnosis given is - in all three cases - uniformist: it is assumed that virtuality is the one and only determinant of our future. What these assessments lack is differentiation and, to begin with, {{a closer look at the}} phenomena as well as the concepts used (or, in my view, misused) when advocating totalizing views of this kind. My intention is not to deny at all the relevance of the processes labelled as `virtualization'. I love and enjoy many of them. I merely object to the totalizing cultural, philosophical or sociological assessments made...|$|E
