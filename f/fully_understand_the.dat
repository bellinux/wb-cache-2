Means {{receives}} a vision herself during the conversation, and becomes convinced that McKenna is a prophet of some sort. Black thinks the girl is acting out, but Means reveals that she is reciting passages from the non-canonical Gnostic Gospels, which supposed that Mary Magdalene was the only disciple to <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> teachings of Jesus Christ. Means believes the girls are not seeing visions of Saint Mary, but of Mary Magdalene.|$|E

The music song by the overweight people at a funeral for a murdered obese man was only shown on the DVD version and not televised, for timing purposes, and for potential boredom to viewers. The musical composition was recorded at Fox studios on the Gary Numan stage. George W. Bush is portrayed hiding in a tree house and being informed by Brian of Hurricane Katrina. Bush was offered the opportunity to voice himself, but declined.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, the Lithuanian {{government}} {{discussed the}} new developments. It decided that Merkys {{should return to}} Kaunas and Urbšys should deliver a note offering withdrawal from the Baltic Entente, a full investigation of the incident, and dismissal of Skučas and Povilaitis. A personal letter from President Antanas Smetona to Chairman of Presidium of the Supreme Soviet Mikhail Kalinin repeated assurances that Lithuania always honored the mutual assistance pact. The third and final meeting between Merkys, Urbšys, and Molotov on June 11 brought no resolution. The Soviets continued to press charges which the Lithuanians could not meaningfully answer and made no more actionable requests. On June 12, Merkys returned to Lithuania and informed {{the government of the}} situation. It was decided that Skučas should resign and Povilaitis would be immediately dismissed. The Lithuanian Army was ordered to be alert, but no orders were issued regarding mobilization or preparedness. Lithuanian politicians did not <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> gravity of the situation and did not think the results would be catastrophic. Urbšys reported that the Soviets strongly disapproved of Merkys and his cabinet; he suggested that a new government be installed, possibly led by Stasys Raštikis, former Commander-in-Chief of the Lithuanian Army. Such suggestion interfered with Lithuania's domestic affairs.|$|E

These are dedicated to the French Moroccan Division, Lions Club International, and Lieutenant-Colonel Mike Watkins. There are also two Commonwealth War Graves Commission cemeteries on site: Canadian Cemetery No. 2 and Givenchy Road Canadian Cemetery. Beyond being a popular location for battlefield tours, the site is also an important location in the burgeoning field of First World War battlefield archaeology, because of its preserved and largely undisturbed state. The site's interpretive centre helps visitors <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> Vimy Memorial, the preserved battlefield park, and the history of the Battle of Vimy within the context of Canada's participation in the First World War. The Canadian National Vimy Memorial and Beaumont-Hamel Newfoundland Memorial sites comprise close to 80percent of conserved First World War battlefields in existence and between them receive over one million visitors each year.|$|E

25|$|Swiss {{linguist}} Ferdinand de Saussure (1857–1913) {{played a}} major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> process of linguistics. The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies. Although semiotics is often used in the form of textual analysis it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.|$|E
25|$|The {{opposition}} to Kenya's action was criticised {{by some other}} TFG officials, militia allied to the TFG, and many ordinary Somalis.

25|$|Building {{up to the}} 2012 presidential election, it was {{interesting}} to see how strong the influence of social media would be following the 2008 campaigns, where Obama's winning campaign had been social media-heavy, whereas McCain's campaign did not really grasp social media. JFK was the first president who really understood television, and similarly, Obama is the first president to <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> power of social media. Obama has recognized social media is about creating relationships and connections and therefore used social media to the advantage of presidential election campaigns, in which Obama has dominated his opponents in terms of social media space.|$|E

25|$|Although {{long term}} studies {{indicate}} URTDs can cause population declines in desert tortoise populations 10–15 years after initial infection, studies of such length {{have not been}} performed on G. polyphemus. One study, which observed G. polyphemus tortoises in Florida from 2003–06, returned the unexpected observation that tortoises which were seropositive for URTD antibodies {{were less likely to}} die over that time than seronegative tortoises. However, the habitats of more seropositive populations had more remains of dead tortoises. The investigators offered the explanation that seropositive tortoises had survived an initial infection, then developed chronic disease. This evidence may imply a possible acute effect on mortality, followed by chronic disease in surviving individuals. Further studies are needed to more <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> effects of URTD on this species.|$|E
25|$|Critical {{reception}} for Gundam SEED Destiny has been positive {{but it was}} often compared with Gundam SEED.

The new cast of characters was well-received with the relationship between Rey Za Burrel and Neo Roanoke bringing speculations regarding their identities due to how it mirrored one from Gundam SEED. However, initial reaction to lead character Shinn Asuka has been mixed due to his antagonistic personality and how some of the new and returning characters overshadowed his role in the series. While at some points Shinn's role and relationships were found entertaining, UK Anime's Ross Liversidge liked how returning character Kira Yamato took bigger role in the series.|$|E

25|$|Sulfatide has {{roles in}} both blood {{coagulation}} and anticoagulation. Sulfatide has anticoagulation activity when it binds to fibrinogen, which prevents fibrinogen from converting to fibrin. Sulfatide {{also has a}} direct inhibitory effect on thrombosis. On the other hand, sulfatide also helps to improve blood coagulation and thrombosis: first, sulfatide is believed to aid in thrombosis through its participation with coagulation factor XII; second, sulfatide binding to annexin V accelerates coagulation; third, sulfatide and P-selectin interactions expressed on platelets, help to ensure stable platelet adhesion and aggregation. However, most of these conclusions have been drawn using exogenous forms of sulfatide. Consequently, additional research and experimentation on endogenous sulfatide is necessary to <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> role of sulfatide in coagulation and thrombosis. Sulfatide is also present in serum lipoproteins, which {{are believed to be}} associated with the cause and development of cardiovascular disease.|$|E

25|$|As seen above, {{voters in}} an STV {{election}} rank candidates on a preferential ballot. STV systems {{in use in}} different countries vary both as to ballot design and {{to whether or not}} voters are obliged to provide a full list of preferences. In jurisdictions such as the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland voters are permitted to rank as many or as few candidates as they wish. Consequently, voters sometimes, for example, rank only the candidates of a single party, or of their most preferred parties. A minority of voters, especially if they do not <b>fully</b> <b>understand</b> <b>the</b> system, might even 'bullet vote', only expressing a first preference. Allowing voters to rank only as many candidates as they wish grants them greater freedom, but can also lead to some voters ranking so few candidates that their vote eventually becomes 'exhausted'; that is, at a certain point during the count it can no longer be transferred and therefore loses an opportunity to influence the result.|$|E
