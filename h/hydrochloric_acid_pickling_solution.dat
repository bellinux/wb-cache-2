Various electrochemical and spectroscopic {{techniques such as}} potentiodynamic cyclic polarization (CPP), open-circuit potential (OCP), electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS), potentiostatic current-time (PCT), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and energy dispersive spectroscopy (EDS) have been employed. CPP measurements indicated that the corrosion current and corrosion rate recorded lower values for the alloy that had higher nickel content. OCP curves proved {{that the presence of}} high Ni content shifts the absolute potential to the positive potential direction. EIS results revealed that the surface and polarization resistances were much higher for the alloy with higher Ni content. PCT curves also showed that the absolute currents were lower for Fe- 45 % Ni alloy. All results were in good agreement with others and confirmed clearly that the corrosion resistance in HCl solutions for Fe- 45 % Ni alloy was higher than that obtained for Fe- 45 % Ni alloy...|$|E

Economic losses associated with a reduction in organoleptic quality of garlic (Allium sativum L.) containing blue-green pigments can be incurred. Preventing blue-green pigment formation can mitigate potential financial and brand equity damages. To prevent pigment formation, inactivation of the enzyme which yields pigment substrates is essential. Two methods to inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation were explored: blanch treatment of whole garlic cloves (100 °C, 5 min); and soaking of whole, non-blanched garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) acetic or citric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> for seven days. The blanching treatment was effective in inactivating the enzyme as the pigment substrate decreased by approximately 99 % as compared with pigment substrate concentrations in non-blanched garlic cloves. Soaking whole garlic cloves in low pH (< 3. 0) <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> did not result in enzyme inactivation as pigments formed in cloves soaked in the acetic <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> solutions; however pigments did not form in cloves soaked in the citric <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> <b>solution.</b> This {{may be due to the}} different effect mono- and poly-carboxylic acids have on the permeability of garlic cell membranes. Blanching garlic cloves can be implemented as a processing step to prevent pigment formation. Soaking garlic in a low pH <b>pickling</b> <b>solution</b> comprised of a poly-carboxylic acid does not inactivate the enzyme associated with pigment formation but pigment formation can be prevented. Other methods presented in the literature to prevent pigment formation include controlling growth, harvest and storage conditions, as well as treating garlic clove homogenates with chemical additives...|$|R

Hydrogen accumulation in the material structure can induce the adverse changes in mechanical/metallurgical properties, i. e. cause hydrogen blistering or even hydrogen embrittlement.

5000|$|The rust {{resistance}} of EPS-processed steel strip {{is superior to}} that of <b>acid</b> <b>pickled</b> steel strip primarily because <b>acid</b> <b>pickling</b> imposes a corrosion [...] "penalty" [...] on the steel which EPS processing does not.

This {{is the case of}} the treatment of spent <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> aiming the recovery of <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> via pyrohydrolysis techniques. Hydrochloric spent <b>pickling</b> <b>solutions</b> from steel processing contain relevant amount of metals such as iron (Fe) and zinc (Zn) that may significantly affect recovery of <b>hydrochloric</b> <b>acid</b> (HCl) through pyrohydrolysis. In fact, although Fe may be recovered as ferric oxide (Fe 2 O 3) and does not have a substantial effect on pyrohydrolysis process, zinc chloride (ZnCl 2) evaporating can occlude nozzles and stick to the pyrohydrolysis reactor walls, thereby contaminating the iron oxide product. Thus, efficient removal Zn is needed. Of note, Zn recovery is economically affordable and can provide commercially valuable by-products such as zinc chloride or sulfate. In this study, we present the results obtained within a laboratory experimental campaign to recover Zn and Fe from pickling liquors by means of liquid-liquid extraction adopting a suitable organic extractant, tributyl phosphate (TBP). In order to find out the best operative conditions leading to very high efficiencies, three main factors were investigated: the volume ratio between the organic extractant and the aqueous spent pickling liquor, the stirring time, and the percentage of TBP used (pure or variously diluted in kerosene). Furthermore, a parallel study was carried out for the analysis the efficiency of the stripping step, performed with the aim of regenerating TBP and recovering Zn and Fe by suitable aqueous stripping solutions.
