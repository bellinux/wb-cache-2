40|$|INTRODUCTION The use of {{computer}} simulations as an optimal design tool which lessens the costs {{in time and}} effort in experimental and physical testing has become prevalent in aerospace design (e. g., {{the design of the}} Boeing 777) and development of automotive mass production items. It is also commonly found in the <b>design</b> of <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> lines where repetitive motion related to parts assembly is critical. In this presentation we discuss a non-aerospace, non-automotive design use {{of computer}} simulations. A team at N. C. State University composed of material scientists, physicists, and applied mathematicians, have used computer simulations as a fundamental design tool in developing a new prototype high pressure organometallic chemical vapor deposition (HPOMCVD) reactor for use in thin film crystal growth. The advantages of such a reactor lie in improved advanced technology products involving exotic materials with high thermal decomposition pressures and i...|$|R
40|$|AbstractSolar field {{thermal output}} {{depends on the}} optical, {{geometrical}} and thermal parameters of the installed solar collectors. In addition to appropriate collector <b>design</b> <b>and</b> quality of the components, proper assembly and installation processes are most relevant for high performance. Target values for the intercept factor {{are in the range}} of 96 - 99 % for typical operating conditions. These values can only be reached if appropriate quality specifications are fulfilled. Specification values are suggested and their implications on intercept factors are discussed based on the well-proven statistical calculation model from Bendt and Rabl. A variety of measurement techniques which can be applied for measurement and control of the geometry parameters are discussed. The application of geometric quality control measurement techniques for prototype collector development as well as for series production of large fields has already contributed to relevant performance increase of parabolic trough collector fields and is constantly required to maintain high output quality of solar field <b>design,</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} project concerns {{the design of}} a rapid response, computer integrated Printed Circuit Board (PCB) Component Assembly System (CAS). The CAS system forms an integral part of a commercially viable Manufacturing Pilot Plant (MPP) for the <b>design,</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> of high quality special purpose PCBs in low volumes. The design of the CAS system begins with the identification of the characteristics and deficiencies of conventional low volume, high variety PCB manufacturing systems. Next, a vision for the MPP as a whole is presented, with particular emphasis on the CAS system. A Generic Manufacturing System Design Methodology (GDM) is then derived, and is applied to the design of the CAS system. Through the GDM a working CAS system is constructed, based around a central CAS Master and 3 assembly workstations. The working CAS system is then analysed through a comparison with a typical conventional low volume manual assembly system. The results support the expectation of superior performance from the envisioned system. Finally, areas requiring further work are identified...|$|R

40|$|The {{three-dimensional}} {{structure of}} gene products {{continues to be}} a missing lynchpin between linear genome sequences and our understanding of the normal and abnormal function of proteins and pathways. Enhanced activity in this area is likely to lead to better understanding of how discrete changes in molecular patterns and conformation underlie functional changes in protein complexes and, with it, sensitivity of an individual to an exposure. The National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences convened a workshop of experts in structural determination and environmental health to solicit advice for future research in structural resolution relative to environmentally responsive proteins and pathways. The highest priorities recommended by the workshop were to support studies of structure, analysis, control, <b>and</b> <b>design</b> of conformational <b>and</b> functional states at molecular resolution for environmentally responsive molecules and complexes; promote understanding of dynamics, kinetics, and ligand responses; investigate the mechanisms and steps in posttranslational modifications, protein partnering, impact of genetic polymorphisms on structure/function, and ligand interactions; and encourage integrated experimental and computational approaches. The workshop participants also saw value in improving the throughput and purity of protein samples and macromolecular assemblies; developing optimal processes for <b>design,</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> of macromolecular complexes; encouraging studies on protein–protein and macromolecular interactions; and examining assemblies of individual proteins and their functions in pathways of interest for environmental health.

40|$|Architectural precast {{concrete}} wall panels {{played an important}} role in mid-twentieth century architecture by providing a concrete technology that could be applied to the curtain wall system of construction utilized in this time period. Moreover, the precasting process, which enabled the controlled production of expressive facing concrete mixes and surface treatments and finishes, made this a concrete technology that could contribute to the architectural expression of the building. To promote the preservation of these panels, this thesis investigates and illuminates their historical and architectural significance in the United States in the mid-twentieth century. There are, however, numerous technical challenges to the physical preservation of architectural precast wall panels, the most significant of which is due to their specially <b>designed</b> concrete mix <b>and</b> surface finish. Given the importance of preserving these characteristics, the general retroactive preservation action of applying patches to deteriorated concrete is unsatisfactory; instead, we must adopt a preventive approach. Towards this end, this thesis examines documents published in the United States between 1945 and 1975 that informed the <b>design,</b> <b>production,</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly</b> of architectural precast wall panels. The information from these documents is used to trace the technological evolution of these panels and, ultimately, to identify potential material vulnerabilities and associated deterioration mechanisms to which they may be subject. This methodology provides foundational information to be used in the creation of preventive conservation plans for buildings constructed with this concrete technology...|$|R
40|$|The {{work has}} been carried out with focus on a ship yards point of view. Application of {{sandwich}} panels in offshore vessels is has for several reasons not had the same development as for other ship types. In this thesis, various aspects generally and specifically related to application in offshore vessels are highlighted. This includes identification of rules and requirements by classification society, challenges related to <b>design,</b> <b>production</b> <b>and</b> <b>assembly,</b> inspection and maintenance. Further, to elaborate on the different aspects and suggestions for existing solutions. <b>Production,</b> joining <b>and</b> integration with primary structure has primary focus. Thus, revelation of bi-effects related to implementation of sandwich panels; being advantages and disadvantages that will arise. Further, based on the literature study, development of a decision support methodology to support the process of choosing the best solution to current application, and application of this in a case study. In sandwich panel design several objectives can be conflicting, such as minimum weight versus minimum cost. Everything from core type, geometry, dimensions, joining, filling, production method, etc. should be evaluated and optimized for the prevailing application. For example, a sound and consistent bond between core and the skins is of outmost importance. Thus, a variety of problems will have to be identified, examined and solved, before one can make use of the many beneficial properties of a sandwich panelA modest decision support methodology for application in offshore vessels has been developed. The necessary input has been derived from literature studies of state-of-the-art within sandwich panel <b>design</b> <b>and</b> construction. A simple case study is carried out to demonstrate the methodology and possible weight savings. The overall conclusion is that sandwich panels are beneficially applied to offshore vessels. The primary drivers may deviate from other applications. Aspects related to <b>production</b> <b>and</b> modular construction are more important than minimum weight. </p...|$|R
40|$|The NASA/industry team {{responsible}} {{for developing the}} J- 2 X upper stage engine for the Space Launch System (SLS) Program has made significant progress toward moving beyond the <b>design</b> phase <b>and</b> into <b>production,</b> <b>assembly,</b> <b>and</b> test of development hardware. The J- 2 X engine exemplifies the SLS Program goal of using proven technology and experience from more than 50 years of United States spaceflight experience combined with modern manufacturing processes and approaches. It will power {{the second stage of}} the fully evolved SLS Program launch vehicle that will enable a return to human exploration of space beyond low earth orbit. Pratt & Whitney Rocketdyne (PWR) is under contract to develop and produce the engine, leveraging its flight-proven LH 2 /LOX, gas generator cycle J- 2 and RS- 68 engine capabilities, recent experience with the X- 33 aerospike XRS- 2200 engine, and development knowledge of the J- 2 S tap-off cycle engine. The J- 2 X employs a gas generator operating cycle designed to produce 294, 000 pounds of vacuum thrust in primary operating mode with its full nozzle extension. With a truncated nozzle extension suitable to support engine clustering on the stage, the nominal vacuum thrust level in primary mode is 285, 000 pounds. It also has a secondary mode, during which it operates at 80 percent thrust by altering its mixture ratio. The J- 2 X development philosophy is based on proven hardware, an aggressive development schedule, and early risk reduction. NASA Marshall Space Flight Center (MSFC) and PWR began development of the J- 2 X in June 2006. The government/industry team of more than 600 people within NASA and PWR successfully completed the Critical Design Review (CDR) in November 2008, following extensive risk mitigation testing. Assembly of the first development engine was completed in May 2011 and the first engine test was conducted at the NASA Stennis Space Center (SSC), test stand A 2, on 14 July 2011. Testing of the first development engine will continue through the autumn of 2011, be paused for test stand modifications to the passive diffuser, and then restart in the spring of 2012. This testing will be followed by specialized powerpack testing intended to examine the <b>design</b> <b>and</b> operating margins of the engine turbomachinery. The development plan beyond this point leads through more system-level, engine testing of several samples, analytical model validation activities, functional and performance verification, and then ultimate certification to support human spaceflight. This paper will discuss the J- 2 X development background, provide top-level information on <b>design</b> <b>and</b> development planning, and will explore some of the development challenges and mitigation activities pursued to date...|$|R
