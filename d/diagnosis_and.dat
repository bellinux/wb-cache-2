Cytological scrapings are often nondiagnostic, as these tumors typically have a desmoplastic stroma and, therefore, do not release diagnostic tumor cells with scrapings.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{diagnosis of}} power switches when the power-distribution-network (PDN) is {{considered as a}} high resolution distributed electrical model. The analysis shows that for a diagnosis method to perform high <b>diagnosis</b> accuracy <b>and</b> resolution, the distributed nature of PDN should not be simplified by a lumped model. For this reason, a PDN-aware diagnosis method for power switches fault grading is proposed. The proposed method utilizes a novel signature generation design-for-testability (DFT) unit, the signatures of which are processed by a novel diagnosis algorithm that grades the magnitude of faults. Through simulations of physical layout SPICE models, we explore the trade-offs of the proposed method between <b>diagnosis</b> accuracy <b>and</b> <b>diagnosis</b> resolution against area overhead and we show that 100 % <b>diagnosis</b> accuracy <b>and</b> up to 98 % diagnosis resolution can be achieved with negligible cos...|$|R
