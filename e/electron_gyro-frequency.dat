These frequencies are close to a multiple of 2 and 3 of the <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> at ionospheric altitudes. Sending a pulse of HF-radio waves upward could accelerate the electrons in the ionosphere. Somewhat like waves on the ocean, {{the character of the}} ionosphere could be inferred from the backscatter signal.

40|$|Abstract. The Fast Auroral SnapshoT (FAST) {{explorer}} frequently {{observes the}} auroral density cavity, {{which is the}} source region for Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR). An {{important factor in the}} generation of AKR is the relative abundance of hot and cold electrons within the cavity, since hot electrons introduce relativistic modifications to the wave dispersion. VLF wave-form data acquired by FAST within the auroral density cavity show clear signatures of whistler-mode waves propagating on the resonance cone. This allows us to obtain the electron plasma frequency, and the cavity often has densities< 1 cm− 3. Moreover, the hot electrons can be the dominant electron species, enabling AKR to be generated below the cold <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency.</b> 1...|$|E
40|$|The {{cyclotron}} maser {{theory of}} Wu and Lee (1979) {{is used in}} treating second-harmonic auroral kilometric radiation (AKR). Good agreement is obtained with the ISIS 1 observation reported by Benson (1982). It is found that when {{the ratio of the}} electron plasma frequency to the electron gyrofrequency is less than 0. 3, the fundamental AKR prevails over the second-harmonic AKR. When the value of this ratio is greater than or approximately equal to 0. 3, the fundamental AKR may become weaker than the second-harmonic AKR, and when it is greater than 0. 3 the fundamental AKR may diminish. It is also found that the second harmonic AKR with frequencies below twice the <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> can propagate downward...|$|E

A rotating magnetic field is produced by external magnetic coils perpendicular to the axis of the machine, and the direction of this field is rotated about the axis. When the rotation frequency is between the ion and <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequencies,</b> the <b>electrons</b> in the plasma co-rotate with the magnetic field (are [...] "dragged"), producing current and reversing the magnetic field.

40|$|We {{present the}} first {{relativistic}} electron pitch-angle and momentum diffusion rates for scattering by whistler-mode {{waves in the}} low density regieme. Diffusion rates are strongly dependent on the ratio between the <b>electron</b> plasma and <b>gyro-frequencies</b> ωpe/Ωe. For conditions typical of storm times, diffusion rates at a few MeV increase by more than 3 orders of magnitude as ωpe/Ωe is reduced from 10 to 1. 5. Diffusion rates are extremely sensitive to energy and become ineffective above 3 MeV. At energies below 100 keV pitch-angle diffusion approaches strong diffusion loss to the atmosphere, while loss at higher energies is much weaker. For storm-time whistler-mode chorus amplitudes near 100 pT, and ωpe/Ωe ≤ 2. 5, acceleration timescales can be {{less than a day}} at 1 MeV. This indicates that chorus diffusion could provide an important mechanism for local acceleration during the recovery phase of storms outside the plasmapause. ...|$|R
30|$|Pump-induced {{striations}} {{are much}} weaker when the pump frequency {{is close to}} a multiple of the <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> at the UHR height (Ponomarenko et al., [1999]) because in this regime, UH waves are forbidden (Grach et al., [1994]). The simultaneous growth/decay of striations and O(1 D) optical emissions were observed where the pump frequency was varied in small increments about the third gyro-harmonic (Kosch et al. [2002 a]), indicating that UHR is important for electron acceleration to suprathermal energies. The downshifted maximum (DM) feature of stimulated electromagnetic emission (SEE) spectra is associated with striations (Leyser, [2001]). The DM minimises when pumping close to the gyro-harmonic (Sergeev et al., [2006]; Stubbe et al. [1994]). Robinson et al. ([1996]) showed that bulk plasma temperature enhancements and anomalous absorption were minimised when pumping on an electron gyro-harmonic. Collectively, all these observations show the vital importance of UH waves for plasma heating and suprathermal electron acceleration.|$|E
40|$|A {{scenario}} {{based on}} the electron cyclotron maser emission is proposed for the fine structures of solar radio emission in the present discussion. It is suggested that under certain conditions modulation of the ratio between the plasma frequency and <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> by ultra low frequency waves, which is a key parameter for excitation of the electron cyclotron maser instability, {{may lead to the}} intermittent emission of radio waves. As an example, the explanation of the observed fine-structure components in the solar type IIIb burst is discussed in detail. Three primary issues of the type IIIb bursts are addressed: 1) what is the physical mechanism that results in the intermittent emission elements that form a chain in the dynamic spectrum of type IIIb bursts, 2) what causes the split pair (or double stria) and the triple stria, 3) why in the events of fundamental-harmonic pair emission there is only IIIb-III, but IIIb-IIIb or III-IIIb cases are very rarely observed.

The experimental observations typically show two distinct types of secondary radiation spectra which are a) discrete narrowband harmonic spectral structures ordered by the ion gyro-frequency, so-called stimulated ion Bernstein Scatter (SIBS) and, b) broadband spectral structure with center frequency near 500 Hz and similar spectral bandwidth named ion acoustic parametric decay (IAPD).

40|$|Abstract. Data {{from the}} Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST) have {{confirmed}} that Auroral Kilometric Radiation (AKR) is generated by the accelerated electrons in the auroral density cavity. FAST observations of the electron distribution within the AKR source region show a characteristic horse-shoe distribution expected from the parallel electric field acceleration and magnetic mirroring of the electrons, the precipitating portion of which constitute the auroral electrons. Within the density cavity {{it is likely that}} the hot electrons carry most, if not all, of the plasma density. The AKR wave characteristics within the source region show that the lower frequency cut-off is below the cold <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency,</b> and near the cut-off, the wave electric and magnetic field polarization is consistent with perpendicularly propagating X-mode waves. Taken together these observations are consistent with the cyclotron maser instability, but with the inclusion of relativistic effects in the wave dispersion, as well as the resonance condition. This allows the accelerated electrons to generate AKR, and further the replenishment of the distribution by the parallel electric field ensures that AKR can be generated over a large altitude range on auroral zon...|$|E
40|$|If, in {{a neutron}} star magnetosphere, an {{electron}} is accelerated to an energy of 10 to the 11 th or 12 th power eV by an electric field parallel to the magnetic field, motion of the electron along the curved field line leads to a cascade of gamma rays and electron-positron pairs. This process is believed to occur in radio pulsars and gamma ray burst sources. Results are presented from numerical simulations of the radiation and photon annihilation pair production processes, using a computer code previously developed {{for the study of}} radio pulsars. A range of values of initial energy of a primary electron was considered along with initial injection position, and magnetic dipole moment of the neutron star. The resulting spectra was found to exhibit complex forms that are typically power law over a substantial range of photon energy, and typically include a dip in the spectrum near the <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> at the injection point. The results of a number of models are compared with data for the 5 Mar., 1979 gamma ray burst.

40|$|We {{consider}} a fast magnetosonic multifluid shock as {{a representation of}} the solar-wind termination shock. We assume the action of the transition happens in a three-step process: In the first step, the upstream supersonic solar-wind plasma is subject to a strong electric field that flashes up on a small distance scale $\Delta z\simeq U_ 1 / \Omega _{\mathrm e}$ (first part of the transition layer), where $\Omega_{\mathrm e}$ is the <b>electron</b> <b>gyro-frequency</b> and $U_ 1 $ is the upstream speed. This electric field both decelerates the supersonic ion flow and accelerates the electrons up to high velocities. In this part of the transition region, the electric forces connected with the deceleration of the ion flow strongly dominate over the Lorentz forces. We, therefore, call this part the demagnetization region. In the second phase, Lorentz forces due to convected magnetic fields compete with the electric field, and the highly anisotropic and energetic electron distribution function is converted into a shell distribution with energetic shell electrons storing about 3 / 4 of the upstream ion kinetic energy. In the third phase, the plasma particles thermalize due to the relaxation of free energy by plasma instabilities. The first part of the transition region opens up a new thermodynamic degree of freedom never before taken into account for the electrons, since the electrons are usually considered to be enslaved to follow the behavior of the protons in all velocity moments like density, bulk velocity, and temperature. We show that electrons may be the downstream plasma fluid that dominates the downstream plasma pressure. Comment: 5 pages, 2 figure...|$|E
