Reactions {{can either be}} carried out in truly biphasic media with mechanical stirring, or in a homogeneous medium derived from water and a miscible organic solvent, such as acetonitrile. Asymmetric epoxidations are commonly carried out under the latter conditions. Some ketone catalysts are more persistent under slightly basic <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions.</b>|$|E
40|$|We present 4 {{experiments}} investigating {{dynamic and}} flexible aspects of semantic activation spread during speech planning. In a semantic blocking paradigm, pictures of objects {{were presented in}} categorically homogeneous blocks consisting of semantic category members (e. g., foods), in blocks consisting of seemingly unrelated objects that could potentially be integrated into a common theme (e. g., fishing trip), or in heterogeneous blocks consisting of entirely unrelated objects. In Experiment 1 we observed a classic semantic interference effect for the categorically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>condition</b> but no effect for the thematically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>condition.</b> In Experiment 2 the blocks were preceded once by visually presented title words. When titles were presented that referred to the semantic category or theme of the block, interference was observed {{not only in the}} categorically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>condition</b> but also in the thematically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>condition.</b> The ad hoc semantic interference effects for thematic relations were replicated with a different set of materials in Experiments 3 and 4. These observations reveal the dynamic nature of the speech production system, shaped by context and formations of flexible ad hoc categories and semantic relations. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

50|$|The {{conditions}} of a homogeneous environment are often approximated to but rarely ever realized. Crystal growth always involves {{some form of}} transport of matter or heat (or both). And <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> for the transport process can only exist for spherical, cylindrical, or infinite plane surfaces. A polyhedral crystal cannot grow (remaining polyhedral) with uniform levels of supersaturation (or supercooling) over its faces. In general, the supersaturation is greatest at its corners. This refutes {{the assumption that the}} growth rate is a function of orientation and local supersaturation.|$|E
50|$|Catalysts {{based on}} cobalt salts were very useful for {{preparation}} of cis-1,4-polybutadienes. Although many cobalt salts were suitable, Horne used cobalt octoate. He showed that cobalt can function under heterogeneous or <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions.</b> He prepared at -78°C a polybutadiene with 99.8% cis-1,4 structure, {{which was the}} highest percentage of cis-1,4 structure he had ever seen. He defined the effect of temperature, solvent, and other additives to the catalyst to produce {{the highest percentage of}} cis-1,4 polymer. He studied many other alkylbutadienes. He polymerized 2-ethyl, 2-propyl, 2-amyl, 2-t-butyl and 2,3-dimethyl butadiene as well as others.|$|E
50|$|In these estuaries, {{tidal flow}} is greater {{relative}} to river discharge, {{resulting in a}} well mixed water column and {{the disappearance of the}} vertical salinity gradient. The freshwater-seawater boundary is eliminated due to the intense turbulent mixing and eddy effects. The width to depth ratio of vertically homogeneous estuaries is large, with the limited depth creating enough vertical shearing on the seafloor to mix the water column completely. If tidal currents at the mouth of an estuary are strong enough to create turbulent mixing, vertically <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> often develop.|$|E

5000|$|Tobler first {{presented}} his seminal idea {{during a meeting}} of the International Geographical Union's Commission on Qualitative Methods held in 1969 and later published by him in 1970. Though simple in its presentation, this idea is profound. Without it, [...] "the full range of conditions anywhere on the Earth's surface could in principle be found packed within any small area. There would be no regions of approximately <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> to be described by giving attributes to area objects. Topographic surfaces would vary chaotically, with slopes that were everywhere infinite, and the contours of such surfaces would be infinitely dense and contorted. Spatial analysis, and indeed life itself, would be impossible." ...|$|E
5000|$|DGVMs {{are usually}} {{run in a}} {{spatially}} distributed mode, with simulations carried out for thousands of [...] "cells", geographic points which are assumed to have <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> within each cell. Simulations are carried out {{across a range of}} spatial scales, from global to landscape. Cells are usually arranged as lattice points; the distance between adjacent lattice points may be as coarse as a few degrees of latitude or longitude, or as fine as 30 arc-seconds. Simulations of the conterminous United States in the first DGVM comparison exercise (LPJ and MC1) called the VEMAP project in the 1990s used a lattice grain of one-half degree. Global simulations by the PIK group and collaborators [...] using 6 different DGVMs (HYBRID, IBIS, LPJ, SDGVM, TRIFFID, and VECODE) used the same resolution as the general circulation model (GCM) that provided the climate data, 3.75 deg longitude x 2.5 deg latitude, a total of 1631 land grid cells. Sometimes lattice distances are specified in kilometers rather than angular measure, especially for finer grains, so a project like VEMAP [...] {{is often referred to as}} 50 km grain.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{classical}} models {{developed for}} degradation and transport of xenobiotics have been derived {{with the assumption}} of homogeneous environments. Unfortunately, deterministic models function well in the laboratory under <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> but such <b>homogeneous</b> <b>conditions</b> often do not prevail in the field. A possible solution is the incorporation of the statistical variation of soil parameters into deterministic process models. This demands the development of stochastic models of spatial variability. To this end, spatial soil parameter fields are conceived as the realisation of a random spatial process. Extrapolation of local fine scale models to large heterogeneous fields is achieved by coupling deterministic process models with random spatial field models...|$|E
