5|$|Horses {{have been}} used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> for most of {{recorded}} history. The first archaeological evidence of horses used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> dates to between 4000 and 3000 BC, {{and the use of}} horses <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> was widespread {{by the end of the}} Bronze Age. Although mechanization has largely replaced the horse as a weapon of war, horses are still seen today in limited military uses, mostly for ceremonial purposes, or for reconnaissance and transport activities in areas of rough terrain where motorized vehicles are ineffective. Horses {{have been used}} in the 21st century by the Janjaweed militias in the War in Darfur.|$|E
5|$|Early thermal {{weapons were}} devices or {{substances}} used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> during the classical and medieval periods (approx 8th century BC until the mid-16th century AD) which used heat or burning action to destroy or damage enemy personnel, fortifications or territories.|$|E
5|$|Mimesis is also {{employed}} by some predators and parasites to lure their prey. For example, a flower mantis mimics {{a particular kind}} of flower, such as an orchid. This tactic has occasionally been used <b>in</b> <b>warfare,</b> for example with heavily armed Q-ships disguised as merchant ships.|$|E

5|$|Since the 5.7×28mm SS190 {{projectile}} {{does not}} rely on fragmentation or the expansion of a hollow-point bullet, the cartridge (and 5.7×28mm firearms) are considered suitable for military use under the Hague Convention of 1899, which prohibits the use of expanding bullets <b>in</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of equestrian technology proceeded {{at a similar}} pace as the {{development of}} horse breeding and utilisation. The changes <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> during the Early Middle Ages to heavy cavalry both precipitated and relied on {{the arrival of the}} stirrup, solid-treed saddle, and horseshoe from other cultures.|$|E

5|$|Another type of {{mounting}} that became fashionable around the mid-Heian period is the kenukigata, or hair-tweezer style, {{named for the}} characteristically shaped hilt, which is pierced along the center. In this style, the hilt is fitted with an ornamental border and did not contain any wooden covering. Like kazari-tachi, swords with this mounting were used for ceremonial purposes but also <b>in</b> <b>warfare,</b> as an example held at Ise Grand Shrine shows.|$|E
5|$|Different endings are {{possible}} {{based on the}} choice the player makes. The endings all involve a battle with the T. rex and escaping the island via a watercraft or helicopter. Regina survives in all endings but depending on the ending, other characters may die. If Regina chases Kirk, Gail reveals that the whole mission was a front and {{the government did not}} want Kirk, but instead wanted the Third Energy to use <b>in</b> <b>warfare.</b>|$|E
5|$|Execution by {{elephant}} {{has been}} done {{in many parts of the}} world, by both Western and Eastern empires. The earliest records of such executions date back to the classical period. However, the practice was already well established by that time and continued well into the 19th century. While African elephants are significantly larger than Asian elephants, African powers were not known to make as much use of the animals <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> or ceremonial affairs compared to their Asian counterparts.|$|E

5|$|Microorganisms {{are useful}} in {{producing}} foods, treating waste water, creating biofuels and {{a wide range of}} chemicals and enzymes. They are invaluable in research as model organisms. They have been weaponised and sometimes used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> and bioterrorism. They are vital to agriculture through their roles in maintaining soil fertility and in decomposing organic matter.|$|E
5|$|Paul Warfield Tibbets Jr. (23 February 1915 – 1 November 2007) was a {{brigadier general}} in the United States Air Force. He {{is best known as}} the pilot who flew the Enola Gay (named after his mother) when it dropped Little Boy, the first of two atomic bombs used <b>in</b> <b>warfare,</b> on the Japanese city of Hiroshima.|$|E
5|$|Probably the {{earliest}} horses with Arabian bloodlines to enter Europe came indirectly, through Spain and France. Others would have arrived with returning Crusaders—beginning in 1095, European armies invaded Palestine and many knights returned home with Arabian horses as spoils of war. Later, as knights and the heavy, armored war horses who carried them became obsolete, Arabian horses {{and their descendants}} were used to develop faster, agile light cavalry horses that were used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|The {{extensive}} {{environmental damage}} {{that resulted from}} usage of the herbicide prompted the United Nations to pass Resolution 31/72 and ratify the Environmental Modification Convention. Many states do not regard this as a complete ban {{on the use of}} herbicides and defoliants <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> but it does require case-by-case consideration.|$|E
5|$|The {{first use}} of horses <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> {{occurred}} over 5,000 years ago. The earliest evidence of horses ridden <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> dates from Eurasia between 4000 and 3000BC. A Sumerian illustration of warfare from 2500BC depicts some type of equine pulling wagons. By 1600BC, improved harness and chariot designs made chariot warfare common throughout the Ancient Near East, and the earliest written training manual for war horses was a guide for training chariot horses written about 1350BC. As formal cavalry tactics replaced the chariot, so did new training methods, and by 360BC, the Greek cavalry officer Xenophon had written an extensive treatise on horsemanship. The effectiveness of horses in battle was also revolutionized by improvements in technology, including {{the invention of the}} saddle, the stirrup, and later, the horse collar.|$|E
5|$|The years 904–906 saw {{the use of}} {{incendiary}} projectiles called 'flying fires' (fei-huo). Needham (1986) {{argues that}} gunpowder was first used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> in China in 919 as a fuse for the ignition of another incendiary, Greek fire. Initially, gunpowder mixtures were utilised through traditional engines and throwing mechanisms; containers and grenades were thrown by mangonels and trebuchets, and explosive rockets and arrows were developed, along with gunpowder flamethrowers.|$|E

Eichelberger, whose I Corps {{headquarters}} {{arrived in}} Rockhampton in August, ordered the division to commence training <b>in</b> jungle <b>warfare.</b> Each infantry battalion {{in turn was}} sent down to Toorbul, Queensland for training <b>in</b> amphibious <b>warfare</b> by the Australian Army.|$|R
5|$|After {{the death}} of king K'iq'ab in 1475 the K'iche' were engaged <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> against both the Tz'utujils and the Kaqchikels, perhaps {{in an attempt to}} recover the former power of Q'umarkaj. A short time after {{the death of}} K'iq'ab, under the {{leadership}} of Tepepul, Q'umarkaj attacked Iximche, the capital of the Kaqchikels, and suffered a disastrous defeat that greatly weakened the K'iche'. After this Q'umarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche. The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum, who was a son of K'iq'ab. who led the K'iche's against the Tz'utujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the role}} of the camel is {{diminishing}} with the advent of technology and modern means of transport, it is still an efficient mode of communication in remote and less-developed areas. The dromedary has been used <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> since the 2nd century BC, and it remains popular for racing, particularly in the Arab world. Riding camels of Arabia, Egypt and the Sahara are locally known as the Dilool, the Hageen and the Mehara respectively; several local breeds are included within these groups.|$|E
5|$|Among the {{earliest}} evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan, dated to approximately 2000 BC. The oldest documentary {{evidence of what}} was probably chariot warfare in the Ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text, of the 18th century BC, which mentioned 40 teams of horses at the siege of Salatiwara. The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot. Widespread use of the chariot <b>in</b> <b>warfare</b> across most of Eurasia coincides approximately {{with the development of}} the composite bow, known from c.1600 BC. Further improvements in wheels and axles, as well as innovations in weaponry, soon resulted in chariots being driven in battle by Bronze Age societies from China to Egypt.|$|E
50|$|The 1st Landwehr Division {{began the}} war on the Eastern Front. In 1914-15, it participated in the battles of Gumbinnen, Tannenberg, and 2nd Masurian Lakes. It then {{took part in the}} Gorlice-Tarnów Offensive. The {{division}} was then primarily employed <b>in</b> positional <b>warfare</b> until the armistice on the Eastern Front. In early 1918, it was transferred to the Western Front, where it was primarily employed <b>in</b> positional <b>warfare</b> <b>in</b> Flanders and Alsace-Lorraine.|$|R
