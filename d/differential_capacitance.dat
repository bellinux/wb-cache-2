Capacitance–potential (C–E) curves are found to vary significantly with changing the direction of potential scan and temperature. C–E curves measured by sweeping the potential from negative to positive direction always have lower capacitance values compared to the curves measured by reversing the direction of potential scan, and this difference is larger for the RTIL with longer alkyl group. Special arrangement of the ions at the interface {{in response to the}} starting potential, constraint in orientation, and change in the ion electrode and ion–ion interactions are presumed to be the causes for this variation. Temperature has a dramatic effect on the Au(111) |EMIBF 4 interface.

From the parabolic electrocapillary curve measured at dropping Hg electrode in PMIBF 4, the potential of zero charge (PZC) was found to be − 0. 31 V vs. Ag/AgCl (wire). However, the capacitance–potential curve at Hg electrode was found not to show any valley related to the PZC, whereas at GC and Au electrodes a minimum was observed at 0. 29 and − 0. 51 V, respectively. The results are in disagreement with the recent theoretical study which implies that the capacitance–potential curve should be of bell shape with the maximum value of capacitance at PZC.

40|$|There is a {{need for}} {{capacitance}} to voltage converters (CVC's) for differential capacitive sensors like pressure sensors and accelerometers which can measure both statically and dynamically. A suitable CVC is described in this paper. The CVC proposed is based on a symmetrical structure containing two half ac bridges, is intrinsically immune to parasitic capacitances and resistances, is capable of detecting capacitance changes from dc up to at least 10 kHz, is able to handle both single and <b>differential</b> <b>capacitances,</b> and can easily be realized with discrete components. Its sensitivity is very high: detectable capacitance changes of the order of 2 ppm of the nominal value (24 aF with respect to a nominal capacitance of 12 pF) result in a measured output voltage of 1. 5 mV. However, due to drift the absolute accuracy and resolution of the CVC is limited to 3. 5 ppm. A differential accelerometer for biomedical purposes was connected to the CVC and showed a sensitivity of 4 V/g.

40|$|<b>Differential</b> <b>capacitances</b> were {{measured}} at Hg/room-temperature ionic liquids (RTILs) interfaces {{as a function}} of potential with the aim of getting an insight of their interfacial structures. Capacitance−potential curve measured at Hg in 1 -ethyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate (EMIBF 4) resembles well the inner layer capacity at the Hg/aqueous solution interface containing nonspecifically adsorbing electrolyte. In both cases, the hump decreases with an increase in temperature which is discussed {{in the light of the}} previous theory. Both the alkyl group and the charged moiety of the cation of 1 -alkyl- 3 -methylimidazolium based RTILs are found to interact concurrently with the Hg surface with the possible change of their orientation in response to the applied potential, and the appearance of a shallow minimum in the capacitance−potential curve related to potential of zero charge (PZC) depends on the extent of their interaction. PZC shifts to the negative direction of potential with increasing the chain length of alkyl residue of the cationic moiety because of the constraint in the orientational change needed for the interaction of positively charged imidazolium ring with Hg surface. Electrocapillary curves were also measured to determine the PZC. Throughout this study, a minimum of the capacitance−potential curve is designated as the PZC in agreement with the maximum of the corresponding electrocapillary curve. Different aspects of the capacitance−potential curves are interpreted satisfactorily on the basis of the hitherto proposed concept of electrical double layer structure...|$|R

They accurately measure mean blood pressure and pulse rate, while systolic and diastolic pressures are obtained less accurately than with manual meters, and calibration is also a concern. Digital oscillometric monitors may not be advisable for some patients, such as those suffering from arteriosclerosis, arrhythmia, preeclampsia, pulsus alternans, and pulsus paradoxus, as their calculations may not correct for these conditions, and in these cases, an analog sphygmomanometer is preferable when used by a trained person. Digital instruments may use a cuff placed, in order of accuracy and inverse order of portability and convenience, around the upper arm, the wrist, or a finger. The oscillometric method of detection used gives blood pressure readings that differ from those determined by auscultation, and vary according to many factors, such as pulse pressure, heart rate and arterial stiffness, although some instruments are claimed also to measure arterial stiffness, and some can detect irregular heartbeats.|$|E

40|$|We apply a {{modified}} Poisson-Boltzmann theory which permits ions {{of different sizes}} and excess polarizabilities {{to the study of}} these properties' effects on the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> of the electric double layer. For a planar electrode, we find an analytical expression for the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance,</b> which is examined in the limits of low and high applied potential.

A similar effect is observed for the excluded volume, but only if the ions are of different sizes. In the high potential limit, the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance</b> decreases inversely with the square root of the applied voltage. In a mixed electrolyte, asymmetries in both ion size and excess polarizability alter the surface adsorption of species: at high potentials, smaller ions displace larger ions and less polarizable ions displace more polarizable ions.

A further consequence of this displacement is the appearance of a second peak in the <b>differential</b> <b>capacitance,</b> which is enhanced by excess ion polarizability...|$|E

40|$|For {{sufficiently}} strong in-plane {{magnetic field}} a ν_T= 1 bilayer quantum Hall pseudo-ferromagnet {{is expected to}} exhibit a soliton lattice. For sufficiently close layers and large in-plane field, we predict this incommensurate "planar" phase P_I to undergo a reentrant pseudo-spin canting transition to an incommensurate state C_I, with a finite out-of-plane pseudo-magnetization component, corresponding to an interlayer charge imbalance in regions between solitons. At T> 0 the transition is in the 2 d compressible Ising universality class, and at T= 0, the quantum transition is in heretofore unexplored universality class. The striking experimental signatures are the universal nonlinear charge-voltage and in-plane field relations, and the divergence of the <b>differential</b> bilayer <b>capacitance</b> at the transition, resulting in a bilayer capacitor that spontaneously charges itself, {{even in the absence}} of an applied interlayer voltage.
