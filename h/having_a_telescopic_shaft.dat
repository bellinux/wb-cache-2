40|$|This work {{concerns}} the final design {{phase of a}} drive train system for an innovative four tilting wheels race vehicle, currently in development at the Motorcycle Dynamics Research Group of the University of Padua. The particular kinematic behavior of this prototype imposes some unusual restraints {{in the design of}} the system: in detail, the difference between frame and wheels roll angles leads to research a drive train configuration with high angles articulation capabilities. Moreover, some assembly design constraints have to be taken into account, too: the presence of other components and the small working space require a smart layout solution. The proposed system is composed by a belt or chain, which connects the prop shaft to a differential, and two final drive axles each one composed by two plunging joints and <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> interconnecting <b>shaft.</b> This solution has been implemented in a multibody assembly, which comprises an almost complete four tilting wheels vehicle, and studied with regards to its kinematic and dynamic behavior: as a result, it was possible to determine an acceptable solution with regards to geometrical aspects. Moreover, dynamic working conditions have been obtained by simulating some critical maneuvers: the corresponding data led to a correct structural dimensioning phase and drove the selection of compatible component...|$|R
5000|$|To {{increase}} the science-fiction appeal, Austin's bionics were made more powerful, {{and he had}} abilities his literary counterpart lacked.

500|$|The {{small size}} of the {{aircraft}} carriers Eagle and Ark Royal, from which the Royal Navy's Phantoms were intended to operate, compared to the US Navy carriers of the period, meant that the F-4K version required significant structural changes compared to the F-4J, from which it was descended, and which performed a similar role. As well as the folding nose radome to allow for storage in the smaller hangars of the British ships, it <b>had</b> to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> significantly strengthened undercarriage {{to account for the}} higher landing weight (British policy was to bring back unused ordnance). It <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> nosewheel oleo that extended by [...] to provide an increased take-off attitude (the extension of the nosewheel put the Phantom at a 9° attitude) due to the shorter and less powerful catapults.

30|$|Mechanical lead {{extraction}} {{systems are}} very useful tools developed for lead extraction procedures. They consist of specially designed locking stylets which fix {{the lead and}} a hand-powered flexible dilator plastic sheath. The sheath has threaded metal distal tip which cuts fibrous adhesions when rotated by a handle. Unlike powered sheaths like laser or electrosurgical dissection sheaths, no energy form is used for extraction. The distal steel blade of the sheath can be more effective on calcified areas on which powered sheaths are less effective (Smith and Love 2008). After the lead is fixed by locking stylet; the sheath is advanced over the lead-stylet complex to cut fibrotic adhesions and liberate the lead from vascular system. Evolution® mechanical dilator sheath which we use in our clinic for extraction procedures also <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> outer polymer sheath which protects venous wall from the metal cutting tip. Leads are extracted by gentle traction, countertraction and by cutting through adhesions with this system. Mechanical extraction systems are less costly than laser systems and successful results are being reported with these systems recently (Starck et al. 2013; Mazzone et al. 2013).|$|R

40|$|Arctic {{exploration}} {{is one of}} {{the main}} trends in today’s oil and gas industry. In shallow waters jack-up mobile drilling units are often used for drilling outside the ice season. The operating period of the jack-ups is strictly limited by the ice conditions.

Gudmestad (University of Stavanger) is considered in this thesis. The concept comprises a hull with icebreaking capabilities and four columnar legs placed on outrigger arms and equipped with protective collars so the jack-up can withstand ice loads in the early ice period. Drilling through one of the jack-up legs is suggested to protect the drill string from the ice impact. The leg should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> design so that the derrick could be skidded over it before drilling.

Wave and ice loads on the jack-up legs are calculated and the possible extension of the drilling season is estimated.

40|$|The {{diffusion}} of wind energy generators is restricted by their strong landscape impact. The PERIMA project {{is about the}} development of an extensible wind tower able to support a wind machine for several hundred kW at its optimal working height, up to more than 50 m. The wind tower <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> structure, made by several tubes located inside each other with their axis in vertical direction. The lifting force is given by a jack-up system confined inside a shaft, drilled below the ground level. In the retracted tower configuration, at rest, tower tubes are hidden in the foundation of the telescopic structure, located below the ground surface, and the wind machine is the only emerging part of the system. The lifting system is based on a couple of oleodynamic cylinders that jack-up a central tube connected {{to the top of the}} tower by a spring, with a diameter smaller than the minimum tower diameter and with a length a bit greater than the length of the extended telescopic structure. The central tube works as plunger and lifts all telescopic elements. The constraint between the telescopic elements is ensured by special parts, which are kept in traction by the force of the spring and provide the resisting moment. The most evident benefit of the proposed system is attained with the use of a two-blade propeller, which can be kept horizontal in the retracted tower configuration...|$|R
5000|$|Uncut said of Standing at the Sky's Edge [...] "that's not to {{say that}} this record is unrecognisable as the work of Richard Hawley. It is still after all a pretty {{sophisticated}} piece of retro music-making - only rather than painstakingly emulating the production values of the late 1950s and early 1960s, he's embraced the echoes, middle eastern modality and wah-wah effects of someone hellbent on creating a heavy psychedelic guitar record." [...] NME felt that [...] "Hawley <b>has</b> always <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> view of rock history, discarding the modern pop frivolities of his guitar work with Longpigs and Pulp to record Mercury-nominated, string-shrouded albums... now he finally feels nostalgia's gotten old, and for this seventh album he's sacked the string section, fired up the psychedelic wah-wah and splurged on the nuclear sunset sounds of early Floyd, The Stooges, and - if we’re to allow him more modern references - early Verve and Spiritualized... It's the psychotropic noise blasts like 'Leave Your Body Behind You' that will make ...Sky's Edge one of 2012's most celebrated albums". PopMatters said [...] "Much has been made of this game-changer of an album in Hawley's native England, where critics have called the release 'dark' and even 'psychedelic'" [...] but [...] "what Standing at the Sky's Edge loses in heartbreak it easily makes up for in depth, and Hawley has just given us something that is truly worth sinking into".|$|R

She <b>has</b> <b>an</b> A-frame on her starboard side and a large A-frame aft. The oceanographic winch and large after A-frame work in conjunction to serve her stern sampling station, while the two hydrographic winches work with the side A-frame to service her side sampling station, and the two hydrographic winches together give Pisces the capability to have three scientific packages ready for sequential operations. One of her hydrographic winches also can deploy lines and equipment over her stern. In addition to trawling, her sampling stations can deploy smaller sampling nets, longlines, and fish traps, and she has modified outriggers for shrimp trawling and gear testing.

50|$|The mine <b>has</b> <b>a</b> {{slightly}} domed {{pressure plate}} made from flexible plastic with a raised 6 spoke wagon wheel pattern on top. Type 72 <b>has</b> <b>a</b> <b>telescopic</b> carrying handle molded {{into the bottom}} of the mine and a large diameter filler plug on the side just above the handle position. The mine <b>has</b> <b>a</b> crimp around the top edge where the mine body meets the pressure plate. The mine contains 5.4 kg of 50:50 RDX/TNT and is actuated when pressure of 300 kg deforms the flexible plastic pressure plate long enough to release the cocked striker fuze. When the pressure plate is moved approximately 9 mm downwards it exerts pressure on the fuze. If fuzed with the T-72 clear plastic-cased blast resistant fuze, pressure on the top of the fuze will depress the casing which will revolve due to the depression of the spring which is attached to the casing. The revolution is controlled by lugs on the inner fuze assembly which fit in grooves in the fuze casing. When the fuze casing is revolved and depressed sufficiently, the two retaining balls to will fall away in groove in the outer casing, which releases the striker. The striker is driven down by the spring, initiating the detonator, which in turn initiates the booster and the main charge. The mine is blast resistant since rapid depression of the fuze will push the fuze casing straight down without any revolution. The lugs on the inner fuze assembly will then slide into vertical groves instead of the diagonal ones. The striker retaining balls will then be prevented from coming in line with the groves in the outer casing and the striker will not be released. Instead the pressure plate will bounce back into its original position.|$|R
