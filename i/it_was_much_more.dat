5|$|During heavy rains, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{difficult}} to track insurgents by air, negating Portugal's air superiority, and Portuguese troops and vehicles found movement during rain storms difficult. In contrast, the insurgent troops, with lighter equipment, {{were able to}} flee into the bush (the mato) amongst an ethnically similar populace into which they could melt away. Furthermore, the FRELIMO forces were able to forage food from the surroundings and local villages, and were thus not hampered by long supply lines.|$|E
5|$|Einstein's 1905 {{predictions}} were verified experimentally {{in several}} ways {{in the first two}} decades of the 20th century, as recounted in Robert Millikan's Nobel lecture. However, before Compton's experiment showed that photons carried momentum proportional to their wave number (1922), most physicists were reluctant to believe that electromagnetic radiation itself might be particulate. (See, for example, the Nobel lectures of Wien, Planck and Millikan.) Instead, there was a widespread belief that energy quantization resulted from some unknown constraint on the matter that absorbed or emitted radiation. Attitudes changed over time. In part, the change can be traced to experiments such as Compton scattering, where <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult not to ascribe quantization to light itself to explain the observed results.|$|E
5|$|The {{opening of}} Giffnock railway station in 1866 allowed {{business}} people to build sandstone villas and commute daily to the city. At the time, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> desirable {{to live in}} Giffnock than {{to live in the}} smog-polluted city. By the early 1890s, residential Giffnock began to grow around the railway station and Eastwood Toll, and by 1892 gas was introduced to the area. Gas street lamps were erected by Busby and District Gas Company in 1893; however, these were supported by a voluntary subscription that many households refused to pay, leaving many areas unlit. It was not until October 1896, when Eastwood Parish Council took over street lighting, that the area was consistently lit at night.|$|E

5|$|A later 1994 {{study by}} Novas instead {{classified}} Herrerasaurus within Dinosauria, and strongly supported its position within Saurischia, as well a provided synapomorphies shared with Theropoda. Novas {{found that the}} primitive features of lacking a brevis fossa and having only two sacral vertebrae were simply reversals found in the genus. In 1996, Novas went further by supporting a theropod position for Herrerasaurus with a phylogenetic analysis, which placed it closer to Neotheropoda than Eoraptor or Sauropodomorpha. Langer (2004) mentioned that this hypothesis was widely accepted, but that more later authors instead preferred to place Herrerasaurus as well as Eoraptor basal to Theropoda and Sauropodomorpha, a clade called Eusaurischia. Langer (2004) conducted a phylogenetic analysis, and found that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely that Herrerasaurus was a basal saurischian, than either a theropod or a non-dinosaurian. Langer's proposal was supported by multiple studies until the discovery of Tawa, when Nesbitt et al. conducted a more inclusive analysis, and the resulting cladogram placed Herrerasauridae basal to Eoraptor, but closer to Dilophosaurus than Sauropodomorpha. Unlike Nesbitt, Ezcurra (2010) conducted a phylogenetic analysis to place his new taxon Chromogisaurus, and found that Herrerasauridae was basal to Eusaurischia.|$|E

25|$|In the north, the Sundance Sea, an {{extension}} of the Arctic Ocean, stretched through Canada down to the United States. Coal is found in the Morrison Formation of Montana, which means that {{the northern part of the}} formation, along the shores of the sea, was wet and swampy, with more vegetation.

25|$|When in August 1713 {{the plague}} broke out again, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> severe than what Hamburg's {{inhabitants}} had experienced in 1712, and the meanwhile returned Danish army established a cordon sanitaire around the city. The cordon was supervised by Major von Ingversleben, who {{had dealt with}} the plague in Helsingør, and effectively prevented the plague from spreading to Holstein again. When the plague finally faded out in Hamburg in March 1714, ~10,000 people had died of the disease.|$|E
25|$|The {{decision}} to redeploy {{turned out to}} be an epic miscalculation as the Siamese threat was never as acute as the threat from Upper Burma, the traditional home of political power in Burma. The Siamese takeover of Upper Tenasserim was an opportunistic land grab taking advantage of Hanthawaddy's preoccupations with Ava. It is unclear whether the Siamese ever planned or had the means to extend their influence into mainland Lower Burma. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> probable that any existential threat to Hanthawaddy would come from Upper Burma.|$|E

25|$|Another area {{of income}} {{important}} to African-born ex-slaves was {{their own work}} as slavers upon being granted their freedom. In fact, purchase of slaves was a standard practice for ex-slaves who could afford it. This is evidence {{of the lack of}} a common identity among those born in Africa and shipped to Brazil, for <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common for ex-slaves to engage in the slave trade themselves than to take up any cause related to abolition or resistance to slavery.|$|E
25|$|Coincidentally {{there was}} a circus in Charlottetown during the conference, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> {{interesting}} {{to the majority of}} the population. There was no one working at the public wharf at the foot of Great George Street when the Canadian delegates arrived on the steamship SS Victoria, so Prince Edward Island representative William Henry Pope had to handle receptions by himself, including rowing out to greet the new arrivals. The Canadian delegates stayed each night on board the SS Queen Victoria, as circus-goers and the Maritime delegates had taken up the accommodations in town.|$|E
25|$|In January 1979, a new freshmen {{generation}} {{arrived to}} the university.

But <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult to replace the fallen or exiled faculty, which resulted in a marked decline in the academic quality of the institution. Later, laws that severely restricted the university autonomy were proposed, and violating the constitutional mandate to give 5% of the national budget to the institution became commonplace for the government.|$|E

25|$|While {{the image}} of a ninja clad in black garb (shinobi shōzoku) is {{prevalent}} in popular media, there is no written evidence for such a costume. Instead, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> common for the ninja to be disguised as civilians. The popular notion of black clothing is likely rooted in artistic convention; early drawings of ninja showed them dressed in black in order to portray a sense of invisibility. This convention was an idea borrowed from the puppet handlers of bunraku theater, who dressed in total black in an effort to simulate props moving independently of their controls. Despite the lack of hard evidence, it has been put forward by some authorities that black robes, perhaps slightly tainted with red to hide bloodstains, was indeed the sensible garment of choice for infiltration.|$|E
25|$|The present Soyuz rocket {{would not}} be able to lift Kliper into low earth orbit, because the {{spacecraft}} (the version designed without Parom) was expected to weigh between 13 and 14.5 metric tons (with payload and crew) whereas Soyuz only has a lifting capacity of around 8 metric tons. It was originally planned to heavily enhance the Soyuz rocket - a project that was labelled the Onega rocket or Soyuz-3. Until fall of 2005 <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely that Kliper would have used an Angara-A3 rocket, which was scheduled to make its first launch in 2012 (however the Angara program has been delayed and Angara-A3 may not be developed in light of the funding of the development of Soyuz 2-3) or possibly a Zenit rocket that is built in Ukraine.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that {{the area around the}} site has received more than 72 inches of rain since A.D. 1450, which was more than needed to support crop growth there. Because of the large amount of rainfall at Machu Picchu, it was found that irrigation was not needed for the terraces. The terraces received so much rain that they were built specifically to allow for ample drainage of the extra water. Excavation and soil analyses done by Kenneth Wright in the 90's showed that the terraces were built in layers, with a bottom layer of larger stones covered by loose gravel. On top of the gravel was a layer of mixed sand and gravel packed together, with rich topsoil covering all of that. It was proven that the topsoil was probably moved from the valley floor to the terraces because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> rich than the soil higher up the mountain.|$|E

25|$|Zephyrettes {{played a}} variety of {{different}} roles, from hostess and tour guide to first aid responder and babysitter, giving attention to all passengers, often with an emphasis on the handicapped, elderly, and children. Sometimes what was required of them was as simple as providing directions; Smith joked that if she had written a memoir about her experiences as a Zephyrette, she would have entitled it Which Way is the Diner?, noting that was a frequent question even in the Dome-Observation car (the last car on the train). Other times <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> difficult; in 1955, Zephyrette Helen Schwartz, with the assistance of porter Roosevelt Williams and two female passengers, successfully delivered a baby on the train outside of Grand Junction, Colorado. That child, Peter Zars, would return to the California Zephyr to celebrate his seventh birthday, again with the assistance of a Zephyrette. Due to the train's prestige, famous passengers were quite common, and Zephyrettes interacted with them directly, from Bernard Baruch and Pierre Monteux to Mamie Eisenhower and professional baseball players.|$|E
25|$|During the 1980s, British Waterways {{began to}} {{introduce}} a hydraulic system for operating paddles, especially those on bottom gates, which are the heaviest to operate. A metal cylinder about a foot in diameter was mounted on the balance beam and contained a small oil-operated hydraulic pump. A spindle protruded from the front face and was operated by a windlass in the usual way, the energy being transferred to the actual paddle by small bore pipes. The system was widely installed and on some canals it became very common. There {{turned out to be}} two serious drawbacks. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> expensive to install and maintain than traditional gear and went wrong more frequently, especially once vandals learned to cut the pipes. Even worse, it had a safety defect, in that the paddle once in the raised position could not be dropped in an emergency, but had to be wound down, taking a good deal longer. These factors led to the abandonment of the policy in the late 1990s, but examples of it survive all over the system, as it is usually not removed until the gates need replacing, which happens about every twenty years.|$|E
25|$|In 1593, Robert Galbraith of Culcreuch {{was given}} a Commission of Justiciary to pursue the outlawed Clan Gregor. The MacAulays and Colquhouns were, however, {{suspicious}} of Culcreuch's real intentions. On 3 May 1593, the chiefs of the two clans complained to the Privy Council that Culcreuch had only purchased the commission under counsel from George Buchanan, and that Culcreuch {{had no intention of}} harassing the MacGregors. The MacAulays and Colquhouns feared that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>much</b> <b>more</b> likely that the Galbraiths, allied with the Buchanans, would direct their vengeance against themselves under the guise of hunting and clearing Clan Gregor from the Lennox. Due to the influence of the Ardincaple's superior, Ludovic Stewart, 2nd Duke of Lennox, the letters of Fire and Sword were taken from the Galbraiths and Buchanans. According to Williams, Ardincaple had been sparing of the entire truth, for no mention was made of the bond of manrent between himself and the now outlawed Clan Gregor chief. Williams was of the opinion that it was unlikely that the Privy Council was aware of such an agreement between the two chiefs. Even so, the Privy Council demanded securities of Ardincaple to insure that he not assist Clan Gregor.|$|E
