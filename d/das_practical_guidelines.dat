30|$|In the {{prevailing}} healthcare paradigm, EBM, {{the best available}} evidence should guide treatment of patients (Sackett et al. 1996; Darlenski et al. 2010). This evidence is translated into clinical and <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines,</b> which thus facilitate EBM and {{could be used as}} a decision-making tool in clinical practice (Skelly et al. 2013). For many psychiatric disorders, treatment is based on such disorder-specific clinical and <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines.</b> However, this disease-focused healthcare system has contributed to its fragmented nature Stange (2009) argues that this fragmented care system has expanded without the corresponding ability to integrate and personalize accordingly. We argue that acknowledging that disorder-specific clinical and <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> address only parts of the care needs is of major importance, since otherwise important aspects of the patients’ needs will be ignored. Because there is an increasing acknowledgement that health care should be responsive to the needs of patients and should change from being disease-focused towards being patient-focused (Mead and Bower 2000; Sidani and Fox 2014), currently in the Netherlands generic <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> are written on specific care themes (e.g. co-morbidity, side-effects, daily activity and participation). These generic <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> address some of the generic needs formulated by the patients in our study. We argue that in addition to disorder-specific <b>guidelines,</b> these generic <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> should increasingly be integrated into clinical practice, while health professionals should continuously be sensitive to other emerging needs. We believe that an integration of a disorder-centered and a patient-centered focus is essential to address all needs a patient.|$|R

40|$|The main {{difference}} between conventional vibrated concrete (CVC) and self-compacting concrete (SCC) is {{observed in the}} fresh state, as SCC has a significantly lower yield stress. On the other hand, the placement of SCC by means of pumping is done with the same equipment and following the same <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> developed for CVC. It can be questioned whether the flow behaviour in pipes of SCC is different and whether the developed <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> can still be applied. This paper describes the results of full-scale pumping tests carried out on several SCC mixtures. It shows primarily that the slump or yield stress of the concrete {{is no longer a}} dominating factor for SCC, as it is for CVC. Instead, the pressure losses are well related to the viscosity and the V-funnel flow time of SCC. Secondly, bends cause an additional pressure loss for SCC, which is in contrast to the observations of Kaplan and Chapdelaine and the estimation of the <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> is not always on the safe side. Finally, due to the specific mix design of SCC, blocking is less likely to occur during pumping operations, but the same rules as for CVC must be applied during start-up...|$|R

The goal {{of this study is to}} come up with some <b>practical</b> <b>guidelines</b> for managers on how to strive for better alignment of ICT investments with business requirements. Based on Luftman’s alignment framework we examine 18 ICT management practices belonging to 6 different competency clusters. We use AntMiner+, a rule induction technique, to create an alignment rule set. The results indicate that B/ICT alignment is a multidimensional goal which can only be obtained through focused investments covering different alignment aspects. The obtained rule set is an interesting mix of both formal engineering and social interaction processes and structures. We discuss the implication of the alignment rules for practitioners.
