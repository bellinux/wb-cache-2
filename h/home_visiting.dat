60|$|March 22d.--Yesterday,--no, {{day before}} yesterday,--I left Liverpool for London by rail, from the Lime Street station. The journey was a dull and {{monotonous}} one, as usual. Three passengers {{were in the}} same carriage with me at starting; but they dropped off; and from Rugby I was alone. We reached London after ten o'clock; and I took a cab for St. James's Place, No. 32, where I found Mr. B------ expecting me. He had secured a bedroom for me at this lodging-house, and I am to be free of his drawing-room during my stay. We breakfasted at nine, and then walked down to his counting-room, in Old Broad Street, in the city. It being a dim, dingy morning, London looked very dull, the more so as it was Good Friday, and therefore the streets were comparatively thin of people and vehicles, and had on their Sunday aspect. If {{it were not for the}} human life and bustle of London, it would be a very stupid place, with a heavy and dreary-monotony of unpicturesque streets. We went up Bolt Court, where Dr. Johnson used to live; and this was the only interesting site we saw. After spending some time in the counting-room, while Mr. ------ read his letters, we went to London Bridge, and took the steamer for Waterloo Bridge, with partly an intent to go to Richmond, but the day was so damp and dusky that we concluded otherwise.

40|$|Introduction: <b>Home</b> <b>visit</b> {{can be an}} {{intervention}} tool in family’s health and in the continuity of postpartum cares. Objective: Examine the impact of nursing <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> in puerperium and in neonates of occidental countries. Methods: The language used was English and the publication period refers to the last 10 years. Expression used in Web of Knowledge ISI database: ((postpartum periodORpuerper*) AND((Home visit*). Results: From 137 articles, 6 articles were eligible, after {{the implementation of the}} protocol of systematic reviews of literature. Three dimensions related to <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> were identified: personal contact; relation cost-benefit/efficacy; importance of <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> to the mothers. According to Salonen et al (2011), online resources with information about puerperium is not effective. Paul et al (2004), Koc et al (2008) and Ammerman et al (2013) demonstrate that <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> reduces parental stress and neonates’ trauma, decreasing rates of hospital readmission. Rodrigues et al (2006) and Aksu et al (2011) show the lower cost of <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> compared to the cost of neonates’ readmission. Mothers who receive <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> choose exclusive breastfeeding, for a longer period, recognizing the importance of <b>home</b> <b>visit.</b> Conclusions: <b>Home</b> <b>visit</b> reduces parental stress, contributes to knowledge acquisition, and reduces neonates’ readmission and morbidity. The interpersonal relationship shows more effectiveness in prevention of postpartum problems unlike online information.

40|$|Abstract Background Against the {{background}} of a decreasing number of general practitioners (GPs) in rural regions in Germany, the AGnES-concept (AGnES = GP-supporting, community-based, e-health-assisted, systemic intervention) supports the delegation of regular GP-home visits to qualified practice assistants. The concept was implemented and evaluated in different model projects in Germany. To explore the economic effects of this concept, {{the development of the}} number of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> in an ambulatory healthcare centre was analysed and compared with the number of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> in the surrounding county. Methods Information about GP-home visits was derived from reimbursement data of the ambulatory healthcare centre and a statutory health insurance. Information about <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> conducted by AGnES-practice assistants was collected from the project documentation over a time period of 12 consecutive quarter years, four quarter years before the beginning of the project and 8 quarter years while the project was implemented, considering background temporal trends on the population level in the study region. Results Within the ambulatory healthcare centre, the <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> by the GPs significantly decreased, especially the number of medically urgent <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> However, the overall rate of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> (conducted by the GPs and the AGnES-practice assistants together) did not change significantly after implementation of the AGnES-concept. In the surrounding county, the <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> rates of the GPs were continuous; the temporal patterns were approximately equal for both usual and urgent <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Conclusion The results of the analyses show that the support by AGnES-practice assistants led to a decrease of GP-home visits rather than an induction of additional <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> by the AGnES-practice assistants. The most extended effect is related to the medically urgent <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> rather than to the usual <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> </p...|$|R

40|$|Background: pre-discharge {{occupational}} therapy (OT) <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> {{are an integral}} part of the discharge process for older adults in acute care. There is limited quality research demonstrating that these pre-discharge visits enhance the health and well being of older adults. This paper outlines the perceptions of older adults and carers of the <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> process from the exploratory phase of an ongoing research project. Method: this qualitative study utilised 22 semi-structured interviews with 15 older adults and 7 carers. Data were analysed using thematic content analysis. Findings: older adults are not fully prepared to undertake <b>home</b> <b>visits,</b> but carers offer them reassurance about the discharge process. For carers, the <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> process appeared to eradicate anxiety, whilst some older adults perceived the process as demoralising, daunting and increasing their anxiety. In addition, older adults were often reluctant to accept changes or to have valued occupations stopped. Conclusion: the findings suggest that the current model of pre-discharge <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> does not promote health and well being. For some older adults the <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> provoked anxiety, however <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> are important to carers...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: {{to assess}} patient {{knowledge}} {{of heart failure}} by home-based measurement of two NOC Nursing Outcomes over a six-month period and correlate mean outcome indicator scores with mean scores of a heart failure Knowledge Questionnaire. METHODS: in this before-and-after study, patients with heart failure received four <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> over a six-month period after hospital discharge. At each <b>home</b> <b>visit,</b> nursing interventions were implemented, NOC outcomes were assessed, and the Knowledge Questionnaire was administered. RESULTS: overall, 23 patients received <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Mean indicator scores for the outcome Knowledge: Medication were 2. 27 ± 0. 14 at <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> 1 and 3. 55 ± 0. 16 at <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> 4 (P< 0. 001); and, for the outcome Knowledge: Treatment Regimen, 2. 33 ± 0. 13 at <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> 1 and 3. 59 ± 0. 14 at <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> 4 (P< 0. 001).

40|$|Pre-discharge {{occupational}} therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke are routinely {{conducted during the}} discharge planning process. However, there is limited research evidence {{about the value of}} these visits for patients. The aims of this study were two fold. Firstly, to identify and report on the value of pre- discharge {{occupational therapy}} <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> for patients returning home after stroke. Secondly, to gain knowledge to inform the design of future research into <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke. Method A qualitative methodology was used. The research method consisted of semi- structured interviews with three participant groups; experts, senior occupational therapists and patients. Interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analysed using a thematic analysis approach. Key findings Following thematic analysis of the thirty four interviews that were conducted (six with experts, 20 with senior occupational therapists and eight with patients), the findings indicate the perceived value of pre-discharge <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke: <b>Home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke offer a bespoke assessment of a patient’s individual needs at home when compared to hospital assessments. The value of pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> has been heavily influenced by their perceived costliness. Consequently the number of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> seems to have reduced. However, opinions were mixed about their cost- effectiveness. There were differing values placed on completing pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> for the purpose of risk management and equipment provision. Pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> were perceived to be of greatest value to patients with moderately severe levels of disability and/or a reduced social support network on their return home. There was mixed opinion, both within and across the participant groups, about the value of completing pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> with patients who had cognitive impairment after stroke. Suggestions were made across the participant groups as to how pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke could be improved to provide better value to patients. Conclusion The main values of the pre-discharge <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> identified by this research were minimising risks, improving independence in activities of daily living, enabling a better quality of life and supporting a patient to adjust to life after stroke. There were mixed opinions about these purposes, making it difficult to generalise the value of pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke. However, the overarching value of the pre-discharge <b>home</b> <b>visit</b> remained its individualised and bespoke nature. In essence, this intervention was felt to be tailored to individual patients, as it varied depending on the impact of stroke, home environment and meaningful activities of daily living. Future research investigating pre-discharge occupational therapy <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> after stroke needs to consider the value of different purposes for which <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> are undertaken.

40|$|Rationale, {{aims and}} {{objectives}} Occupational violence is increasingly {{recognized as a}} problem in general practice, and has been suggested as adversely affecting general practitioners' (GPs) provision of services to patients. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the association of experiences of violence and perceptions of risk of violence with provision of after-hours GP care and <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Method A questionnaire-based cross-sectional survey of GPs in three Australian Urban Divisions of General Practice was used. Results Five hundred and twenty-eight GPs completed the survey (response rate 49 %). Of the GPs surveyed, 63. 7 % were subjected to some form of violence in the previous 12 months. Risk of violence influenced 10. 2 % of GPs' delivery of in-hours <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> and 22. 0 % of GPs' delivery of after-hours <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> A further 4. 7 % of GPs reported not performing after-hours <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> at all during the previous 12 months because of safety concerns. On logistic regression, gender, location of practice and country of medical qualification were significantly associated with provision of in-hours and after-hours <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Experience of violence during the previous 12 months was not significantly associated with provision of <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> Conclusions This study's finding of GPs' self-reported restriction of practice and withdrawal from <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> and after-hours calls in response to risk of violence represents a significant primary health care issue. GPs' decision to provide after-hours calls and <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> is complex, and the finding of lack of significant association of experiences of violence with provision of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> and after-hours calls is likely to be due to the cross-sectional nature of the study...|$|R

40|$|Objectives: To assess health {{outcomes}} of <b>home</b> follow-up <b>visits</b> after postpartum discharge and assess {{relationships between the}} number of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> and selected outcomes among women who gave birth at two Queensland, Australia, regional hospitals. Design: A cross sectional study. Services provided during the <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> were responsive to a woman’s need rather than having a structured protocol of services. Main Outcome Measures: The four measured {{health outcomes}} were: 1) postpartum depression; 2) confidence to undertake maternal roles; 3) breastfeeding; and, 4) satisfaction with postpartum care. Results: Of 210 women who were {{invited to participate in the}} study, 143 (68. 1 %) provided information. Women who received a higher number of <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> had significantly lower confidence to undertake maternal roles than those who received fewer <b>home</b> <b>visits.</b> There was a positive correlation {{between the number of}} <b>home</b> follow-up <b>visits</b> and postpartum depression among women who gave birth at one hospital (Hospital B), but not at the other (Hospital A). No relationship was found between the <b>home</b> postpartum <b>visits</b> and the other outcomes. Conclusion: These results could be explained in that <b>home</b> follow-up <b>visits</b> were offered to all women at Hospital A while Hospital B only provided <b>home</b> <b>visits</b> to women who had a health risk due to their social, physical and psychological characteristics.
