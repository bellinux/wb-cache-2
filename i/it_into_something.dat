5|$|In January 2011, {{the actor}} {{screened}} his multimedia project entitled Three's Company The Drama, {{in which he}} merges video and art to update the former sitcom, at the 2011 Sundance Film Festival. Franco reunited with Milk director Van Sant to make Unfinished, a project that features two movies: Endless Idaho and My Own Private River. Endless Idaho showcases edited outtakes, deleted scenes and behind-the-scenes footage from the 1991 movie My Own Private Idaho, while My Own Private River focuses on the late actor River Phoenix. The idea for the exhibition was conceived after Van Sant introduced unused footage from the 1991 film to Franco, inspiring him to turn <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> more. Unfinished opened from February 26 to April 9 at the Gagosian Gallery in Beverly Hills.|$|E

But I don't want to make <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> more than what it is. I didn't have a Bar Mitzvah.... I didn't celebrate the holidays." [...] He reiterated: [...] "It's something that draws a lot of interest and something I take pride in." [...] Braun's mother, however, said he is not Jewish.|$|E

50|$|The {{whole point}} of the title was to {{pinpoint}} what a non-existent line there is between commercialism and prostitution today. Just take one letter off the name of the place, where everybody does their everyday shopping and <b>it</b> turns <b>into</b> <b>something</b> resembling a knocking shop.|$|R
500|$|At Paleyfest {{in early}} 2007, Steve Carell later {{recalled}} that {{he enjoyed the}} episode [...] "because it spoke {{to the fact that}} Michael is not a homophobe; he just doesn't understand the world. They are two very different things. It's not that he's intrinsically racist or homophobic or sexist, he just doesn't have a frame of reference. He's not capable of understanding. And once he does glean some understanding he misinterprets <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> altogether. But I think at least the way I feel about the character is he's a decent heart, a decent person and he's just trying his best." ...|$|E
500|$|On February 5, 2010, Gaga {{was interviewed}} by Ryan Seacrest on KIIS-FM. She commented on the video, saying, [...] "What I like about it is it's a real true pop event, and when I was younger, I was always excited {{when there was a}} big giant event {{happening}} in pop music and that's what I wanted this to be." [...] Gaga also said that her intent was to take [...] "the idea that America is full of young people that are inundated with information and technology and turn <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that was more of a commentary on the kind of country that we are." ...|$|E
500|$|The [...] "Bale Out" [...] mashup {{incorporates}} audio {{clips of}} Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding [...] "I {{was looking at}} the lights." [...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but I hope he does. I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E

5000|$|The {{idea was}} to take the {{creative}} overflow from The Receiving End of Sirens and bottle <b>it</b> up <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that I could keep with me. There was never a plan to take it on the road, or to release it. It was only when things with them went awry that I was given the opportunity to really make <b>it</b> <b>into</b> a traditional sort of thing.|$|R
500|$|Although {{the pair}} were officially equal partners, Cleese later thought that Chapman contributed {{comparatively}} {{little in the}} way of direct writing, saying [...] "he would come in, say something marvellous and then drift off in his own mind." [...] The other Pythons have said that Chapman's biggest contribution in the writing room was an intuition for what was funny. Gilliam later recalled that [...] "Graham would do the nudge that would push <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> extraordinary." [...] The show was an immediate success, and Chapman was delighted to learn that medical students at St Bartholomew's crowded round the television in the bar to watch it. Chapman was frequently late for rehearsing or recording, leading to the other Pythons calling him [...] "the late Graham Chapman".|$|E
500|$|The {{accuracy}} of the EP's style parodies was also positively critiqued. Andy Chalk of The Escapist magazine wrote that the music style of [...] "Craigslist" [...] was a [...] "dead-on parody of The Doors", and Marc Hirsh of NPR argued that the composition and performance of [...] "Craigslist" [...] is evidence that Yankovic is a [...] "stealth pop musicologist", being able to deconstruct a genre of work and recreate <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> new without it being unrecognizable. Wild wrote that [...] "CNR" [...] and [...] "Ringtone" [...] were both [...] "even more winning" [...] than the parodies found on Alpocalypse. Brian May, guitarist for Queen, felt that Yankovic [...] "perfectly spoofed [...] vocal and guitar harmonies" [...] of the band in [...] "Ringtone".|$|E
500|$|Epworth {{stated that}} the producers' request was for [...] "a {{dramatic}} ballad", so he and Adele tried to [...] "do something that was simultaneously dark and final, like a funeral, and to try and turn <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that was not final. A sense of death and rebirth". Epworth watched the first thirteen Bond films seeking the [...] "musical code" [...] of the songs, [...] "whatever the modal structure or the chord that always seemed to unify those songs" [...] {{and contributed to the}} mood and [...] "that kind of '60s jazzy quality". Epworth identified as an uniting factor [...] "a minor ninth as the harmonic code... the Bond songs, they have that elaboration to it", and wrote what would become the instrumental part of [...] "Skyfall". He described it as [...] "a bit of a 'Eureka!' moment".|$|E
5000|$|In an {{interview}} with Billboard Magazine, Capitol Records Nashville president and CEO Mike Dungan commented on Up on the Ridge saying that [...] "The album {{was supposed to be}} a side project, but <b>it's</b> grown <b>into</b> <b>something</b> much more....He had a real sense of direction and made a vehicle for people to hopefully discover this music".|$|R
5000|$|In Vibe, a {{few years}} after the fact, Andre {{recalled}} creating the song; [...] "'Ms. Jackson' was an acoustic guitar song that I was doing at home. Then I just converted <b>it</b> over <b>into</b> <b>something</b> people could understand a little bit more." [...] The song was inspired, in part, by Andre's relationship with Erykah Badu and her mother.|$|R

500|$|The task of {{creating}} God's voice {{was given to}} Lon Bender and the team working with the film's music composer, Hans Zimmer. [...] "The challenge with that voice {{was to try to}} evolve <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that had not been heard before," [...] says Bender. [...] "We did a lot of research into the voices that had been used for past Hollywood movies as well as for radio shows, and we were trying to create something that had never been previously heard not only from a casting standpoint but from a voice manipulation standpoint as well. The solution was to use the voice of actor Val Kilmer to suggest the kind of voice we hear inside our own heads in our everyday lives, as opposed to the larger than life tones with which God has been endowed in prior cinematic incarnations." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1991, Zappa {{was chosen}} {{to be one of}} four {{featured}} composers at the Frankfurt Festival in 1992 (the others were John Cage, Karlheinz Stockhausen, and Alexander Knaifel). Zappa was approached by the German chamber ensemble Ensemble Modern which was interested in playing his music for the event. Although ill, he invited them to Los Angeles for rehearsals of new compositions and new arrangements of older material. Zappa also got along with the musicians, and the concerts in Germany and Austria were set up for later in the year. Zappa also performed in 1991 in Prague, claiming that [...] "was {{the first time that he}} had a reason to play his guitar in 3 years", and that that moment was just [...] "the beginning of a new country", and asked the public to [...] "try to keep your country unique, do not change <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> else".|$|E
500|$|I {{try not to}} get too {{specific}} so {{that people}} can apply the lyrics to their own lives. When I was growing up and listening to the radio and I would hear a song that reminded me of a certain person or a situation or whatever, I would {{want to be able to}} completely connect it to that moment. And then if I heard someone explaining it and making <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> totally different, it ruined it for me. So I kind of like to keep it open for people's imaginations. It evokes something different depending on who listens to it and at what time. [...] "Don't Forget About Us" [...] could give you a good, happy memory, or you could be miserable, crying, listening to it over and over. All in all, I think it's good to have music you can live vicariously through, and that's what a lot of people have told me this record has been for them.|$|E

50|$|Upon {{shooting}} {{their research}} {{of the origins of}} the missing kids’ stories, Zeman and Brancaccio realized that the truth did not dwindle <b>into</b> <b>something</b> concrete; instead, <b>it</b> expanded <b>into</b> <b>something</b> larger and convoluted, becoming an in depth investigation of five missing children’s stories. The objective was to bring the distinct elements into one overarching narrative: the oral tradition of urban legends; the mystery of the missing children; the courtroom drama; the search for the roots of Staten Island’s obsession with the case, the community’s need for catharsis.|$|R
500|$|Jay Carr of The Boston Globe called Apt Pupil [...] "most {{compelling}} for its moral dimension", enjoying the [...] "duet between Renfro's smooth-cheeked latter-day Faust and McKellen's reawakened Mephistopheles". While Carr found the film's framework to be realistic, {{he noted the}} change of pace, [...] "Perhaps sensing a narrative slackening and a smothering claustrophobia... 'Apt Pupil' veers into melodramatic devices that yank the film out of its disquieting amorality and turn <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> much more ordinary and mundane." [...] The critic concluded, [...] "It maintains a bleak integrity by not pretending to arrive at remorse. Never is there any discussion." [...] Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune described Apt Pupil as [...] "a good shocker that misses the ultimate horror", finding the film's weakness to be the [...] "contrived" [...] bond between Dussander and Bowden. [...] Wilmington called the plot [...] "overly slick", asking, [...] "How can Todd not only conveniently find a Nazi war criminal in his hometown but also instantly coerce and control him?" ...|$|E
500|$|Lillywhite {{believed}} that the African influences had not translated well onto the album, remarking: [...] "It's a pity because {{the whole idea of}} Morocco as a big idea was great. When the big idea for U2 is good, that is when they succeed the most, but I don't think the spirit of what they set out to achieve was translated. Something happened that meant it did not come across on the record." [...] The Edge concurred, admitting that the group erred by [...] "starting out experimental and then trying to bring <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> that was more accessible". He added, [...] "I think probably we should have said, 'It's an experimental work. That's what it is.'" [...] Mullen refers to the album as [...] "No Craic on the Horizon" [...] and said, [...] "It was pretty fucking miserable. It turns out that we're not as good as we thought we were and things got in the way." ...|$|E
500|$|Some critics {{felt that}} the album's {{production}} was inferior to that of Dr. Octagonecologyst. KutMasta Kurt, a frequent collaborator with Thornton, disliked the album's production, stating [...] "The Dr. Octagon character was rapping over sounds that were dark and sinister, but they turned the album into this dancey electro-pop. A lot of it had this Euro-dance feel, and I was like, 'Wait a second, {{not only did they}} change the music, they changed <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> [...] I couldn't relate.'" [...] KutMasta Kurt also recounts a conversation with Thornton on a European flight in December 2006, in which Thornton stated that The Return of Dr. Octagon does not sound like a Dr. Octagon album. Thornton himself said that he liked the album's production, but that the album hurt his reputation as a musician. According to Thornton, [...] "I'm not mad. But I don't repeat words when I rap. They cooked up some electronic stuff, you know, WORD! WORD! WORD! making me sound like triple people. It's interesting." ...|$|E
5000|$|Sparrow: Sparrow is {{the brother}} of Flying Bear and Big Mountain, as well as Zhuli's cousin. He {{develops}} a musical relationship with Zhuli through their interests at the conservatory. Sparrow writes several symphonies throughout the novel but struggles to share them {{out of fear of}} judgement. He has a close relationship with Kai because of their work together with classical music, but <b>it</b> grows <b>into</b> <b>something</b> more.|$|R
5000|$|Tim DeGravine of Allmusic {{later wrote}} of the song, [...] "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." [...] is just as thrilling as [...] "Take on Me". Starting as a sad ballad, <b>it</b> explodes <b>into</b> <b>something</b> much more, as {{chugging}} guitars and operatic synths keep pace with Harket's evocative vocal stylings. If ever a 1980s song qualified as Wall of Sound, [...] "The Sun Always Shines on T.V." [...] would be it.|$|R
5000|$|Blake Edwards co-{{wrote the}} script, {{initially}} titled Kansas City Blues. He originally wrote the script in the 1970s {{while living in}} Switzerland. [...] "I really wrote the story for myself," [...] says Edwards. [...] "But when Julie read it, {{she thought it was}} the best thing I'd done and over the years friends urged me to film it. So to see <b>it</b> turned <b>into</b> <b>something</b> completely different was very painful for me." ...|$|R
500|$|The {{album was}} {{intended}} to be released as a mixtape; with tracks linked through interludes and turntable effects, but was then changed to be set up like a film. Dr. Dre stated, [...] "Everything you hear is planned. It's a movie, with different varieties of situations. So you've got buildups, touching moments, aggressive moments. You've even got a 'Pause for Porno.' It's got everything that a movie needs." [...] Speaking of how he did not record the album for club or radio play and that he planned the album simply for entertainment with comical aspects throughout, he commented [...] "I'm not trying to send out any messages or anything with this record. I just basically do hard-core hip-hop and try to add a touch of dark comedy here and there. A lot of times the media just takes this and tries to make <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> else when it's all entertainment first. You shouldn't take it too seriously." ...|$|E
500|$|Burton chose Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania as {{his primary}} filming {{location}} for Metropolis, while start dates for filming were pushed back. A minor {{piece of the}} Krypton set was constructed but then destroyed, and Cage had even attended a costume fitting. The studio was also considering changing the title Superman Lives back to Superman Reborn. Deeming Wesley Strick's script too expensive, Warner Bros. {{enlisted the help of}} Dan Gilroy to rewrite <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> more economically feasible. Gilroy lowered the $190million budget set by Strick's draft to $100million. However, the studio was still less willing to fast track production, due to financial reasons with other film properties, having Gilroy turn in two drafts. Ultimately, Warner Bros. chose to put the film on hold in April 1998, and Burton left to direct Sleepy Hollow. At this point in production, Warner Bros had spent $30million on developing the film. Burton, citing various differences with Peters and the studio, said, [...] "I basically wasted a year. A year is a long time to be working with somebody that you don't really want to be working with." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Web Weirdos" [...] {{was written}} and storyboarded by Ako Castuera and Jesse Moynihan, from a story {{developed}} by series creator Pendleton Ward, Patrick McHale, Kent Osborne, and Dick Grunert. According to Ward, the original outline for the episode was [...] "super-sitcomy" [...] and [...] "standard". Castuera and Moynihan, however, {{were able to}} transform <b>it</b> <b>into</b> <b>something</b> different. In the DVD commentory for the episode, Castuera noted that she enjoys physical comedy, whereas Moynihan likes focusing on emotion. She contended that this episode is therefore epitomic of their differing storyboarding sensibilities. For instance, {{the first half of}} the episode (storyboarded by Castuera) begins with Finn and Jake partaking in parkour, whereas the second part of the episode (storyboarded by Moynihan) focuses more on Barb and Ed's relationship. According to Moynihan, much of his storyboard material was inspired by experiences he had had at couples therapy with a former girlfriend. He noted that for him, the episode was based on the idea that you have to have empathy for your partner.|$|E
50|$|Guitarist Stone Gossard {{added the}} siren-like guitar part. Gossard on the song:That song {{went through a}} cool {{evolution}} {{that goes back to}} what we've been saying about creative input. Dave played us the two main parts, that BAM-BAM-BAM groovy chordal riff bit and then the main ascending riff in more of an acoustic vein. Then, when he got behind the drums, everyone turned up real loud and <b>it</b> evolved <b>into</b> <b>something</b> else, a little more hard core.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{a product}} of Mindsmack, a {{multi-media}} studio based in New York City, New York, which does web development for companies including Citibank and IBM. The idea originally came from {{president and chief executive officer}} Sam Feuer's wife Amie. [...] "The goal was to find her a bathroom in a store or the mall as quick as possible.
