500|$|Biden's most {{important}} role {{within the administration}} was to question assumptions, playing a contrarian role. Obama said that [...] "The best thing about Joe <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> get everybody together, he really forces people to think and defend their positions, {{to look at things}} from every angle, and that is very valuable for me." [...] Another senior Obama advisor said Biden [...] "is always prepared to be the skunk at the family picnic to make sure we are as intellectually honest as possible." [...] On June 11, 2010, Biden represented the United States at the opening ceremony of the World Cup, attended the England v. U.S. game which was tied 1–1, and visited Egypt, Kenya, and South Africa.|$|E
500|$|The Ludys {{argue that}} one's love {{life should be}} both guided by and {{subordinate}} to one's relationship with God. They suggest that, [...] "if God's plan and purpose for you is marriage, then the person you will one day marry... is alive and wandering the earth" [...] and that this knowledge should encourage people to act {{in such a way}} that their future spouses would be pleased. The Ludys contest the definition of [...] "true love" [...] as an emotion; instead, they define [...] "true love" [...] as the choice to commit to another person no matter what happens. Eric writes that [...] "there are two ways each of us can approach life: spending our days meeting our needs or looking for ways to meet others' needs. The mystery <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> spend our life focused on our own needs, we are never satisfied... but when we pour out our life and focus on how we can serve others... our deepest needs are met as well!" ...|$|E
2500|$|The underage {{depiction}} of Kasumi and a feature in Dead or Alive: Dimensions called Figure Modewhich allows players to capture {{images of the}} characters from all angles and store themwere linked to Nintendo's decision to not sell the game in Sweden, allegedly due to the country's strict child pornography laws. Hearing of the Nordic ban and that Dimensions was being sold in Australia with a PG classification, the Minister for Home Affairs Brendan O'Connor and the Australian Classification Board re-examined the game and revoked its classification, although Nintendo Australia assured the board that the game contained no material which could be considered child pornography. Upon re-submission, the game was awarded the stronger (but not age-restricted) M classification and was re-released shortly after. The game's cover art, which featured a high-kicking Kasumi, was slightly altered for the United States release. Reports indicating it was done to appease the ESRB appeared, but a Tecmo Koei spokesperson claimed that [...] "this whole thing is getting blown way out of proportion. The truth <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> submitted the box art as-is from Japan, {{there were a few}} parties both internal and external who thought there might be some issue with the image. Nobody 'demanded' anything be changed, it was just pointed out. You have to pick your battles, and covering up that small bit of the image seemed to be harmless." ...|$|E
60|$|Therefore it <b>was</b> <b>that,</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> came {{each day}} on the green {{in front of my}} uncle's house to go through such {{manoeuvres}} as our instructor thought necessary, we had in our hands only those harmless wooden guns.|$|R
60|$|Therefore it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> {{invested}} our {{savings in}} a small sloop-rigged pungy, {{with the idea of}} making a living by fishing, we named her the Avenger, with never a thought that she might one day do something toward avenging poor Tom's wrongs.|$|R
60|$|A {{moment later}} {{and we were}} {{whirling}} up as we had whirled down. I suppose that Yva came with us though I never saw her do so, and the odd thing <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> arrived in the sepulchre, she seemed already to be standing there waiting to direct us.|$|R

5000|$|The {{beauty of}} playing in the band <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> went onstage we never {{actually}} {{knew what was going}} to go on within the framework of the songs. They were constantly changing. New parts would come out on the night. The spontaneity was on the level of ESP, which meant it was always exciting.|$|R
60|$|Not only Sir Walter Raleigh, {{who knew}} Master Lane very well, {{but many other}} people in England also learned to smoke, and {{therefore}} it <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> of Jamestown began to raise tobacco, it found a more ready sale in London than any other thing we could send over. Once this was known, our people gave the greater portion of their time to cultivating the Indian weed.|$|R
60|$|Before {{we reached}} the plain of Phutra we were {{discovered}} by a company of Sagoths, who at first stood to give battle; but upon seeing the vast numbers of our army they turned and fled toward Phutra. The result of this <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> came in sight of the hundred towers which mark the entrances to the buried city we found a great army of Sagoths and Mahars lined up to give us battle.|$|R
6000|$|Flora Schuyler {{smiled a}} trifle drily.

60|$|And so, in {{humble and}} thankful mood, I close this account. Our eyes have seen great wonders and our souls are chastened {{by what we}} have endured.

5000|$|Senegal and Montpellier striker Souleymane Camara, who was {{a member}} of the Senegal team at the 2002 World Cup finals, told L'Équipe, [...] "More than a coach, he was a big brother to us. What I liked about him <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> had to work, <b>we</b> worked, <b>when</b> it was time to have a laugh, we laughed. His speech to the Senegal team before the France-Senegal match at the 2002 World Cup finals ... I still talk about it to my friends. He managed to motivate us so much that we could not lose. He knew how to find the right words." ...|$|R
5000|$|The Who {{were not}} at their peak exactly, but with [...] "the mini opera", we were just about {{starting}} to tap into something that became a complete obsession for me.

I am determined not to occupy his attention to the exclusion of Caroline, and my plan <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> are in the dense part of the wood I will lag behind, and slip away, and leave them to return by themselves. I suppose the reason of his attentiveness to me lies in his simply wishing to win the good opinion of one who is so closely united to Caroline, and so likely to influence her good opinion of him.|$|E

Then, without waiting for Peter to reply, her tongue rattled on. [...] "I do wish he would be careful. Sometimes I am afraid he will overdo. Just look at him now! He is singing so hard that he is shaking all over. He always is that way.

60|$|I had a {{note from}} Mrs. Marden this {{afternoon}} asking me to go round and see her. I intended {{to do so in}} any case, but had not excepted to find bad news waiting for me. It seems that the Armstrongs, from whom Agatha has expectations, are due home from Adelaide in the Aurora, and that they have written to Mrs. Marden and her to meet them in town. They will probably be away for a month or six weeks, and, as the Aurora is due on Wednesday, they must go at once--to-morrow, if they are ready in time. My consolation <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> meet again {{there will be no more}} parting between Agatha and me.|$|E
40|$|The {{essential}} insight {{of speech}} act theory <b>was</b> <b>that</b> <b>when</b> <b>we</b> use language, we perform actions—in {{a more modern}} parlance, core language use in interaction {{is a form of}} joint action. Over the last thirty years, speech acts have been relatively neglected in linguistic pragmatics, although important work has been done especially in conversation analysis. Here we review the core issues—the identifying characteristics, the degree of universality, the problem of multiple functions, and the puzzle of speech act recognition. Special attention is drawn to the role of conversation structure, probabilistic linguistic cues, and plan or sequence inference in speech act recognition, and to the centrality of deep recursive structures in sequences of speech acts in conversatio...|$|R
