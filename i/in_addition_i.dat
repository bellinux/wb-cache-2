Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

It is a matter of common knowledge that in Fatwas such as these I do not use the word [...] "killing" [...] but rather I say [...] "struggle", which is a more comprehensive word than the word [...] "killing" [...] and whose meaning is not necessarily to kill. <b>In</b> <b>addition,</b> <b>I</b> have condemned the taking of hostages {{on a number of occasions}} in the past and have demanded that they be released and that their lives not be threatened.|$|E

60|$|In {{order to}} make the {{biography}} a study from first-hand material I planned a series of inspirational trips which filled in a large part of '96.

Either I missed some subtle point or their language was excessively simple--almost exclusively composed of concrete substantives and verbs.

Their sentences were usually simple and of two words, and I failed to convey or understand any but the simplest propositions. I determined to put the thought of my Time Machine and the mystery of the bronze doors under the sphinx as much as possible in a corner of memory, until my growing knowledge would lead me back to them in a natural way. Yet a certain feeling, you may understand, tethered me in a circle of a few miles round the point of my arrival.|$|E
