5|$|One of {{the first}} {{projects}} was to build equipment to transition from the British long-wave radar to the new microwave centimeter-band radar {{made possible by the}} cavity magnetron. In working on the Microwave Early Warning system (MEW), Alvarez invented a linear <b>dipole</b> <b>array</b> antenna that not only suppressed the unwanted side lobes of the radiation field, but also could be electronically scanned without the need for mechanical scanning. This was the first microwave phased-array antenna, and Alvarez used it not only in MEW but in two additional radar systems. The antenna enabled the Eagle precision bombing radar to support precision bombing in bad weather or through clouds. It was completed rather late in the war; although a number of B-29s were equipped with Eagle and it worked well, it came too late to make much difference.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—A {{plane wave}} {{incident}} {{at an angle}} on a finite length wire produces resonant current peaks, caused by end reflections. This model aids in understanding why similar current peaks occur in arrays of collinear connected <b>dipoles.</b> Index Terms—Connected <b>arrays,</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays,</b> phased arrays, wire scattering. MOMENT method studies of connected <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> {{have shown that the}} connections provide a smoothing of the current distribution when the array length is several wavelengths or less and the dipoles are short. However, when the dipoles are roughly half-wave, the current on a connected array is peaked, with peaks apart. These arrays consist of a row of collinear dipoles, with adjacent collinear dipoles connected [1], [2]. To explicate this phenomenon a simple model of a plane wave incident at an arbitrary angle on a thin wire of finite length is examined...|$|R

The present investigation of sequentially pulsed semi-infinite planar <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> extends our previous studies of sequentially pulsed infinite and semi-infinite line <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> and of infinite planar <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays.</b> The discrete element-by-element radiations are converted collectively to radiations from a series of Floquet wave (FW) -modulated truncated smooth equivalent aperture distributions, and to corresponding FW-modulated edge diffraction. After a summary of necessary results from the earlier studies, emphasis is placed on the new truncation-induced TD results and interpretations, which are extracted via phenomenology-matched high-frequency asymptotics from rigorous frequency and time domain formulations parameterized in terms of the dispersive FW instantaneous frequencies and wave numbers. As in our previous studies, the outcome is a numerically efficient, physically incisive algorithm whose accuracy is verified preliminarily by application to a pulsed planar strip <b>array</b> of <b>dipoles...</b>|$|R

40|$|The problem tackled in {{this study}} is one of MIMO {{transceiver}} implementation in which we consider how to design and test compact antenna arrays that have the ability to preserve the native information bearing capacity of a MIMO channel. Mutual coupling in antenna arrays is known to degrade the performance of a MIMO system. However, no tests involving compact arrays have been performed using a MIMO transceiver architecture that is capable of measuring the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. In this study, two novel compact MIMO antenna arrays were designed and integrated into a wideband MIMO radio testbed. These arrays are extremely compact yet have acceptable mutual coupling and radiation efficiency and resonate in three wide frequency bands. A measurement campaign was executed in which MIMO channel sounding measurements were taken using the compact <b>arrays</b> and <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> in a variety of indoor environments. The MIMO transceiver used for channel sounding is able to measure the effect of mutual coupling on system performance. A comparison of the relative performance between the compact antenna <b>arrays,</b> <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> and the i. i. d. Gaussian channel is presented. Results show that the proposed compact <b>arrays</b> outperformed <b>dipole</b> <b>arrays</b> in all scenarios and that MIMO capacity does not scale linearly in the number of antennas if the antenna arrays exhibit mutual coupling...|$|R

50|$|In early 1938, Butement {{started the}} {{development}} of a CD system based on Bowen’s evolving 200-MHz (1.5-m) airborne sets.

Although many of Bowen’s transmitter and receiver components were used, the system would not be airborne so there were no limitations on antenna size.
