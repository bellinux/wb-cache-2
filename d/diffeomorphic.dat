25|$|Cheeger-Gromoll's Soul theorem. If M is a non-compact {{complete}} non-negatively curved n-dimensional Riemannian manifold, then M {{contains a}} compact, totally geodesic submanifold S such that M is <b>diffeomorphic</b> {{to the normal}} bundle of S (S is called the soul of M.) In particular, if M has strictly positive curvature everywhere, then it is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to Rn. G. Perelman in 1994 gave an astonishingly elegant/short proof of the Soul Conjecture: M is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to Rn if it has positive curvature at only one point.|$|E
25|$|Orientable {{surfaces}} can be visualized, {{and their}} diffeomorphism classes enumerated, by genus. Given two orientable surfaces, one can {{determine if they}} are <b>diffeomorphic</b> by computing their respective genera and comparing: they are <b>diffeomorphic</b> {{if and only if}} the genera are equal, so the genus forms a complete set of invariants.|$|E
25|$|Freedman's main theorem about Casson handles {{states that}} they are all homeomorphic to D2R2; or in other words they are topological 2-handles. In general they are not <b>diffeomorphic</b> to D2R2 as follows from Donaldson's theorem, and there are an {{uncountable}} infinite number of different diffeomorphism types of Casson handles. However the interior of a Casson handle is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to R4; Casson handles differ from standard 2 handles only in the way the boundary is attached to the interior.|$|E
25|$|Unfortunately, it {{is known}} that for {{manifolds}} of dimension 4 and higher, no program exists that can decide whether two manifolds are <b>diffeomorphic.</b>|$|E
25|$|Invariants: The plurigenera are all 1. The {{surface is}} <b>diffeomorphic</b> to S1 × S1 × S1 × S1 so the {{fundamental}} group is Z4.|$|E
25|$|The plane {{itself is}} homeomorphic (and <b>diffeomorphic)</b> {{to an open}} disk. For the {{hyperbolic}} plane such diffeomorphism is conformal, but for the Euclidean plane it is not.|$|E
25|$|Sphere theorem. If M is a simply {{connected}} compact n-dimensional Riemannian manifold with sectional curvature strictly pinched between 1/4 and 1 then M is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to a sphere.|$|E
25|$|Two smooth {{surfaces}} are <b>diffeomorphic</b> if {{and only if}} they are homeomorphic. (The analogous result does not hold for higher-dimensional manifolds.) Thus closed {{surfaces are}} classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.|$|E
25|$|When k = n or n1 {{we saw in}} the {{previous}} section that V'k(Fn) is a principal homogeneous space, and therefore <b>diffeomorphic</b> to the corresponding classical group. These are listed in the table at the right.|$|E
25|$|The {{simplest}} exotic Casson handle {{corresponds to}} the tree {{which is just a}} half infinite line of points (with all signs the same). It is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to D2D2 with a cone over the Whitehead continuum removed.|$|E
25|$|Two smooth {{surfaces}} are <b>diffeomorphic</b> if {{and only if}} they are homeomorphic. (The analogous result does not hold for manifolds of dimension greater than three.) It follows that closed {{surfaces are}} classified up to diffeomorphism by their Euler characteristic and orientability.|$|E
25|$|These are {{the minimal}} compact complex {{surfaces}} of Kodaira dimension 0 with q = 0 and trivial canonical line bundle. They are all Kähler manifolds. All K3 surfaces are <b>diffeomorphic,</b> and their diffeomorphism class {{is an important}} example of a smooth spin simply connected 4-manifold.|$|E
25|$|Polyhedra, {{such as the}} {{boundary}} of a cube, are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry. It is also possible to define smooth surfaces, in which each point has a neighborhood <b>diffeomorphic</b> to some open set in E2. This elaboration allows calculus {{to be applied to}} surfaces to prove many results.|$|E
25|$|The Cartan–Hadamard theorem {{states that}} a {{complete}} simply connected Riemannian manifold M with nonpositive sectional curvature is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to the Euclidean space Rn with n = dim M via the exponential map at any point. It implies that any two points of a simply connected complete Riemannian manifold with nonpositive sectional curvature {{are joined by}} a unique geodesic.|$|E
25|$|Polyhedra in the Euclidean space, {{such as the}} {{boundary}} of a cube, are among the first surfaces encountered in geometry. It is also possible to define smooth surfaces, in which each point has a neighborhood <b>diffeomorphic</b> to some open set in , the Euclidean plane. This elaboration allows calculus {{to be applied to}} surfaces to prove many results.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} of smooth closed manifolds is well understood in principle, except in dimension 4: in low dimensions (2 and 3) it is geometric, via the uniformization theorem and {{the solution of}} the Poincaré conjecture, and in high dimension (5 and above) it is algebraic, via surgery theory. This is a classification in principle: the general question of whether two smooth manifolds are <b>diffeomorphic</b> is not computable in general. Further, specific computations remain difficult, and there are many open questions.|$|E
25|$|The most general {{conditions}} under which the quotient map will admit local cross-sections are not known, although if G is a Lie group and H a closed subgroup (and thus a Lie subgroup by Cartan's theorem), then the quotient map is a fiber bundle. One {{example of this is}} the Hopf fibration, S3→S2 which is a fiber bundle over the sphere S2 whose total space is S3. From the perspective of Lie groups, S3 can be identified with the special unitary group SU(2). The abelian subgroup of diagonal matrices is isomorphic to the circle group U(1), and the quotient SU(2)/U(1) is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to the sphere.|$|E
25|$|More precisely, locally homeomorphic here {{means that}} each point m in the {{manifold}} M has an open neighborhood homeomorphic {{to an open}} neighborhood in Euclidean space, not to the unit ball specifically. However, given such a homeomorphism, the pre-image of an -ball gives a homeomorphism between the unit ball and a smaller neighborhood of m, so this is no loss of generality. For topological or differentiable manifolds, one can also ask that every point have a neighborhood homeomorphic to all of Euclidean space (as this is <b>diffeomorphic</b> to the unit ball), but this cannot be done for complex manifolds, as the complex unit ball is not holomorphic to complex space.|$|E
25|$|If both {{manifolds}} are oriented, {{there is}} a unique connected sum defined by having the gluing map reverse orientation. Although the construction uses {{the choice of the}} balls, the result is unique up to homeomorphism. One can also make this operation work in the smooth category, and then the result is unique up to diffeomorphism. There are subtle problems in the smooth case: not every diffeomorphism between the boundaries of the spheres gives the same composite manifold, even if the orientations are chosen correctly. For example, Milnor showed that two 7-cells can be glued along their boundary so that the result is an exotic sphere homeomorphic but not <b>diffeomorphic</b> to a 7-sphere.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{the focus}} on {{comparison}} of shapes and forms with a metric structure based on diffeomorphisms, and {{is central to the}} field of computational anatomy. <b>Diffeomorphic</b> registration, introduced in the 90's, is now an important player that uses computational procedures for constructing correspondences between coordinate systems based on sparse features and dense images, such as ANTS, DARTEL, DEMONS, LDDMM, or StationaryLDDMM. Voxel-based morphometry (VBM) is an important method built on many of these principles. Methods based on <b>diffeomorphic</b> flows are used in For example, deformations could be diffeomorphisms of the ambient space, resulting in the LDDMM (Large Deformation <b>Diffeomorphic</b> Metric Mapping) framework for shape comparison. One such deformation is the right invariant metric of computational anatomy which generalizes the metric of non-compressible Eulerian flows to include the Sobolev norm, ensuring smoothness of the flows. [...] Metrics have also been defined that are associated to Hamiltonian controls of <b>diffeomorphic</b> flows.|$|E

[...] Furthermore, suppose the subset p−1(U) is a disjoint union of open sets {{each of which}} is <b>diffeomorphic</b> with U by the mapping p. [...] If the space X contains a closed timelike curve (CTC), then the space X is timelike multiply connected (no CTC can be timelike homotopic to a point, as that point would not be causally well behaved), its universal (<b>diffeomorphic)</b> cover is timelike simply connected (it does not contain a CTC).|$|E

2500|$|In mathematics, 4-manifold is a 4-{{dimension}}al topological manifold. A smooth 4-manifold is a 4-manifold with {{a smooth}} structure. In dimension four, in marked contrast with lower dimensions, topological and smooth manifolds [...] are quite different.
