25|$|The castle was {{constructed}} between 1270 and 1282 {{in the typical}} square plan of the fortifications in Savoy. The end of the 15th century stands out as the golden age {{in the history of}} the counts. In 1476, count Louis takes part in the Burgundy war by the Confederates’ side. Following this deed of valour, modernization works were undertaken. The adjustment of the esplanade with its chapel, the spiral staircase in the courtyard and the transformation of the main building <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> time. Thus, the castle loses its fortress appearance to become a stately residence. The baroque interiors remind one of the time when the bailiffs sent by Fribourg lived there. The romantic landscapes were painted in the mid-19th century by Jean-Baptiste-Camille Corot, Barthélemy Menn and other artists.|$|E

It really does feel like an extension of that... It was a chance to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> world and explore it deeper. It always seemed incomplete because I conceived it like a film, and what would you do without Die Hard 2?" [...] Meat Loaf himself was more succinct. He told an interview at the time, [...] "We called it Bat Out of Hell II 'cos that would help it sell shitloads." ...|$|E
500|$|Lyrically, Backspacer {{displays}} {{a more positive}} outlook than the band's last few albums. Vedder credited the election of President Barack Obama as inspiration for the optimistic lyrics. Regarding the lyrics, Vedder said, [...] "I've tried, over the years, to be hopeful in the lyrics, and I think that's going to be easier now." [...] Gossard stated, [...] "We've {{made a couple of}} political and pointed records, the last two in particular, and just to move away from that is great, because it allows you to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> when you need to and it refreshes everybody, and it comes down to a beat and a melody and your friends and a lyric and a poem and something that's important to you." [...] Vedder stated he did not spend [...] "more than half hour" [...] writing the lyrics to each song: [...] "If it’s not gonna happen quick then I don’t wanna do it, because it means there’s another one out there that is gonna happen quick, and is gonna hit you like a lightning bolt." ...|$|E

500|$|... "New Rules" [...] {{was written}} by Caroline Ailin, Emily Warren and its {{producer}} Ian Kirkpatrick, and was included on Dua Lipa's eponymous debut studio album in 2017. Lipa worked on the record during three years, stating that the extended process led to her writing and recording songs until {{she felt she had}} a considerable amount to pick from. When asked what it was like working with younger artists like Lipa and Noah Cyrus, Warren stated that they both were [...] "older souls" [...] and that she helped them to express what they wanted to say. [...] "In both cases they were pretty comfortable telling those stories. [...] end up being true to each artist because it is coming from their story, too," [...] Warren said. Kirkpatrick also engineered and programmed the track, while Chris Gehringer mastered it and Josh Gudwin mixed it. Talking about the song, the artist explained that [...] "'New Rules' is quite different to a lot of tracks on the album. I wanted it to feel very new [...] It's the breakup song that I wish I had when I was breaking up with someone" [...] and that [...] "It's about keeping your distance from someone who's bad for you. I'm setting some rules down so [...] won't <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> person." [...] "New Rules" [...] was sent to contemporary hit radio in the United Kingdom on 21 July 2017 as the album's sixth single. It impacted the same format in the United States on 22 August 2017. Three days later, a remixed version by Australian DJ Alison Wonderland was released on iTunes.|$|E

But it doesn’t mean I don’t want to write any records like that. It’s {{going to be really}} pleasant to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> way of working, where I sit around and do stuff myself." [...] Both keyboardist and guitarist Andy Monaghan and touring member Simon Liddell collaborated with Scott on the project, which was later named Owl John.|$|E

The same day, Governor Rick Perry of Texas, formerly {{a supporter of}} Giuliani, threw his support behind McCain as well. Meanwhile, Romney, still burning about McCain's misleading Iraq withdrawal timetable charge, compared McCain to disgraced former President Richard Nixon, saying that McCain's claim was [...] "reminiscent of the Nixon era" [...] and that [...] "I don't think I want to see our party <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> kind of campaigning." ...|$|E

If somebody misses that kind of sound, they’ll be happy to hear this album because it <b>goes</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> time, you know.

She stated, [...] "I was very, very sad. Very down. I couldn't get up sometimes.

She questioned her career path, feeling pressured by {{the demands of the}} entertainment industry, saying, [...] "People look at you differently, as if you're not human." [...] Abbie Kearse of MTV responded, [...] "You're creating a person who might not really be you, but you've created this fantasy woman, so when it's time to get back to business, it's like 'I've got to <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> world'". Jackson expressed concern for how she could portray an object of fantasy, feeling as if she could no longer fulfill her own desires.|$|E
2500|$|During the 2010s, {{there was}} a {{discussion}} within media of a possible nu metal revival because of bands fusing nu metal with other genres, the return of nu metal bands, extant bands {{going back to the}} nu metal genre and nu metal bands forming.

Korn's 2010 studio album [...] sold 63,000 copies during its first week of release and peaked at number 2 on the Billboard 200.

According to Chuck D, [...] "We had tight dealings with MCA Records and {{were talking about}} taking three guys that were left over from New Edition {{and coming up with}} an album for them. The three happened to be Ricky Bell, Michael Bivins, and Ronnie DeVoe, later to become Bell Biv DeVoe.

Subsequently, what happened in the four weeks of December [...] was that the Bomb Squad knocked out a large piece of the production and arrangement on Bell Biv DeVoe's three-million selling album Poison.

But I {{want to make sure you}} understand. Am I quitting? Well, let's get that settled right now. No, I'm not. And the reason is simple—I never learned arithmetic. You see folks, while I didn't get a college degree in mathematics and writing, I majored in miracles. Mathematically impossible miracles. It is because I <b>go</b> <b>back</b> <b>to</b> <b>that</b> which helped crystallize in me a conservative viewpoint as a teenager when it wasn't easy or popular to be a Republican or a conservative in my hometown, because I do believe that America is about making choices, not simply echoing that of others. Let others join the [...] "Me, too" [...] crowd. But I didn't get where I am today and I didn't fight the battles in a state that, when I became its governor, was 90 percent Democrat, by simply echoing the voices of others. I did it by staking out a choice, stating that choice, making that choice and fighting for that choice, to believe that some things were right, some things were wrong, and it's better to be right and even to not win than it is to be wrong and to be a part of the crowd." ...|$|E
