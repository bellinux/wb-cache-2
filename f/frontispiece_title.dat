The work, reprinted eight times in the first year, quickly inserted itself in the regional literary debates of the time, with an unauthorized Florentine edition (1645) dedicated to Salvator Rosa soon challenged by a Bolognese edition (1646) dedicated to Virgilio Malvezzi. Over the following three decades and beyond there were another thirty printings at a dozen different Italian presses, especially Venetian, of which half a dozen [...] "per Giunti" [...] with a signature <b>frontispiece</b> <b>title</b> illustration.|$|E

Although a draft was completed, it was never published, and this electronic publication presents his manuscript in a more polished form. Editors Peter Neary and Melvin Baker's introduction provides contextual background on Newfoundland's World War II experience as well as a detailed biographical sketch of Fraser's life. "Fraser's work is mainly a chronology of events [ [...] . ] It is very much a 'work in progress' but is nevertheless a useful introduction and guide to a period of rapid and sweeping change and a reference source of considerable value [ [...] . ] presented here as a document - a compendium rather than a monograph" (p. 12).

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{the role of}} the book in the seventeenth-century sunspot controversy between Galileo Galilei and Christoph Scheiner. The thesis will show that during this dispute, the book played a role beyond that of a receptacle of information, functioning not only as a weapon with which to attack one's rivals, but also as a tool to obtain and thank patrons. To do so, this thesis will first study the context of the seventeenth scientific revolution in astronomy. It will then examine the context of the Early Modern European Patronage system, as well as the role played by the Printing Revolution, before taking a look at Galileo and Scheiner's backgrounds, and giving a summation of events in the sunspot controversy. Finally, this thesis will analyze the material evidence found in Galileo and Scheiner's books relating to this controversy, including but not limited to <b>frontispieces,</b> <b>title</b> pages, portraits, letters of dedication and plates...|$|R
