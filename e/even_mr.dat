500|$|The New York Times {{film critic}} Vincent Canby called Moonraker [...] "one {{of the most}} buoyant Bond films of all. Almost {{everyone}} connected with the movie is in top form, <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Moore. Here he's as ageless, resourceful, and graceful as the character he inhabits." [...] Canby subsequently said the film was, alongside Goldfinger, {{the best of the}} series.|$|E
500|$|Records of McCay's birth are not extant. [...] He {{stated in}} an {{interview}} in 1910 that he was born in 1869, and this is the year listed on his grave marker. [...] in life, he told friends he was born September26, 1871, in Spring Lake, and they published this information in a magazine. [...] Michigan census records from 1870 and 1880 list a ZenasW. , who was born in Canada in 1867. [...] No Canadian birth record has been found, and a fire in Spring Lake in May 1893 could have destroyed any American birth record he may have had. [...] His obituary in the New York Herald Tribune stated, [...] "not <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> McCay knew his exact age".|$|E
2500|$|ARMITAGE: Well, <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Novak {{has said}} that he used the word [...] "operative" [...] and misused it. No one ever said [...] "operative." [...] And I not only assumed it, as I say, I've never seen a covered agent's name in a memo. However, that doesn't take away from what Mrs. Plame said, it was foolish, yeah. Sure it was.|$|E
60|$|CLERK. Good evening, sir. (Passes on.) Good <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Barlow.|$|R
60|$|That <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bale sent Bob back to {{the hotel}} by himself.|$|R
60|$|The {{excitement}} soon {{spread over}} Ingleside, infecting <b>even</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Blythe and Susan.|$|R
2500|$|The Secrisy of this Mutiny {{is beyond}} all {{conception}} so that I can not discover that any who are with me had the least knowledge of it. It is unbeknown {{to me why}} I must beguile such force. <b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Tom Ellison took such a liking to Otaheite [...] that he also turned Pirate, so that I have been run down by my own Dogs...|$|E
2500|$|In 2006, Adrien Jones, the {{president}} of the Owain Glyndŵr Society, said, [...] "Four years ago we visited a direct descendant of Glyndŵr, a John Skidmore, at Kentchurch Court, near Abergavenny. He took us to Mornington Straddle, in Herefordshire, where one of Glyndŵr's daughters, Alice, lived. Mr Skidmore told us that he (Glyndŵr) spent his last days there and eventually died there.... It was a family secret for 600 years and <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Skidmore's mother, who died shortly before we visited, refused to reveal the secret. There's even a mound where he is believed to be buried at Mornington Straddle." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hart-Davis {{believes}} that Peter Fleming failed {{to consider the}} possibility that Mr. A. had unknowingly transmitted the communications [...] "telepathically and subconsciously" [...] to Vera. Certainly the [...] "slushy" [...] prose in Take Over and the other manuscripts were the sort a man like Mr. A. with his background would perpetrate. The manuscripts frequently used the adjective [...] "pleasurable" [...] as did Mr. A. in conversation; <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> A.'s initial letter to Peter Fleming promised [...] "very pleasurable news concerning your late brother Ian." [...] A communication purportedly from Maugham claimed that the deceased authors wished for those still alive to believe life continues after death and that [...] "life goes on and very pleasurably I can assure you.".|$|E
60|$|That <b>evening</b> <b>Mr.</b> Ormskirk {{continued}} {{the subject of}} his talk of the afternoon.|$|R
60|$|One <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Harvey and {{his wife}} were absent from the usual gathering.|$|R
50|$|In the Barthwicks' {{dining room}} that <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> and Mrs. Barthwick and Jack are having dessert.|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>Mr</b> Clare {{began to}} feel tragical at the dairyman's desperation.|$|E
60|$|Elfride {{was struck}} with that look of his; <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Swancourt noticed it.|$|E
60|$|They all {{gathered}} eagerly around Mr. McCormick; <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Dumphy, {{who was still}} moving away, stopped.|$|E
60|$|That <b>evening</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Tolbridge and {{the doctor}} held a conference {{in regard to the}} {{quarters}} of the Dranes.|$|R
60|$|The misery in {{my voice}} must have {{penetrated}} <b>even</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Fursey's bosom, for she answered more sympathetically than usual.|$|R
60|$|That <b>evening</b> <b>Mr.</b> Wallace found Otter gazing disconsolately at {{the little}} house in which Leonard and Juanna were staying.|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Flint did {{not know}} how like a knell his words sounded in Isaac Worthington's ears.|$|E
60|$|The two {{trustees}} {{looked at}} each other. <b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Peaseley had not conceived such a damning revelation.|$|E
60|$|The first {{laughter}} {{of the evening}} went around the table, and <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Calvin joined in the laugh against himself.|$|E
60|$|That <b>evening,</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Fosdyke indulged her sly {{sense of}} humor in a new way. She handed me an almanac.|$|R
60|$|On {{the first}} <b>evening</b> <b>Mr.</b> Thurwell {{broached}} some plans for his entertainment, but Sir Allan stopped him at once.|$|R
60|$|CLERK. Good evening, sir. Good <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Barlow. Er--did {{you want}} anybody at the office, sir? We're just closing.|$|R
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Bishopriggs {{felt the}} {{necessity}} of being silent when he stood {{face to face with}} her on answering the bell.|$|E
60|$|Mary Louise {{laughed so}} heartily {{that the boy}} cast an upward, half- {{approving}} glance at her face. <b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Conant's stern visage relaxed.|$|E
60|$|<b>Even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Henley was human; his ugly {{face looked}} uglier still. It assumed the self-satisfied {{expression}} {{of a man who}} had carried his point.|$|E
60|$|KEEGAN [at {{the garden}} door, with gentle gravity]. Good <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr</b> Broadbent. You have set me thinking. Thank you.|$|R
6000|$|She {{runs out}} panic-stricken the instant Mrs. Eustace Macallan looks at her. <b>Even</b> <b>Mrs.</b> Beauly, it seems, has a conscience! ...|$|R
60|$|One <b>evening</b> <b>Mr.</b> Rudolph Block, of New York, {{found himself}} seated at dinner {{alongside}} Mr. Percival Pollard, the distinguished critic.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{not sure}} that <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> M'Gabbery would admire the tents so much if he had not some Christian comforts along with him." ...|$|E
60|$|But at {{last she}} became so unwell, that <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> St. Clare had to own that {{something}} was wrong, and the doctor was sent for.|$|E
60|$|Had Skip {{been there}} the prisoner's case {{would have been}} {{strengthened}} just so much; but he yet remained absent, and <b>even</b> <b>Mr.</b> Hunter looked disheartened.|$|E
60|$|When {{a strange}} young man {{assisted}} Matlack at the supper-table that <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> Archibald asked {{what had become}} of Martin.|$|R
6000|$|... "Good <b>evening,</b> <b>Mr.</b> McNeil," [...] said I, {{stepping}} forward and addressing the Wigtown factor, with whom I had some slight acquaintance.|$|R
