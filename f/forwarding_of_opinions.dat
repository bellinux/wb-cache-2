It intends to respond to the {{summoning}} whose object is the putting <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and experience as to the status of evaluation in Research Projects. The starting point is the contextualization of three thematic polisemic nucleus/cores of interpretation variables such as: opinion, experience and evaluation. This work is based on the establishment of matters and queries deriving from a brief analysis of existing regulations/norms. These aim to, on the one hand, promote the production of knowledge as from the design of research projects, and on the other, settle the issues to be considered when the referred-to projects have been accredited. Thereby the Decree n. 2427 / 93 is analysed and especially articles n. 31 through 34 of Resolution n. 811 / 03, MECyT Procedures Manual. The text concludes by advocating for the construction of an assessment culture in the academic environment...|$|R

The author utilizes Eulerian method to build the model of air traffic networks, and solves the problem with adjoint method, then uses it to optimize the flow of the route, The author also builds the model of ground delay program with fair factor, and solves it with particle swarm optimization method. The author also uses the real data to prove the feasibility of the above two methods. Also, the author designs the original system of air traffic flow management, and gives the flow of operation and the output of interface.

Risk, uncertainty, and {{divergence}} <b>of</b> <b>opinion.</b> Journal <b>of</b> Finance 32, 1151 - 1168] hypothesizes {{that prices}} of stocks subject to high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and short-sales constraints are biased upward. We expect earnings announcements to reduce differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> among investors, and consequently, these announcements should reduce overvaluation. Using five distinct proxies for differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> {{we find that}} high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks earn significantly lower returns around earnings announcements than low differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks. In addition, the returns on high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> stocks are more negative within the subsample of stocks that are most difficult for investors to sell short. These results are robust when we control for the size effect and the market-to-book effect and when we examine alternative explanations such as financial leverage, earnings announcement premium, post-earnings announcement drift, return momentum, and potential biases in analysts' forecasts. Also consistent with Miller's theory, we find that stocks subject to high differences <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> and more binding short-sales constraints have a price run-up just prior to earnings announcements that is followed by an even larger decline after the announcements.

40|$|This paper aims at {{evaluating}} J. M. Coetzee’s Diary of a Bad Year – a novel which, for {{the time}} being at least, has received much less critical assessment than the writer’s widely-acknowledged masterpieces – {{from the perspective of the}} intertextual relation it establishes with Western philosophers in point of political thinking, but also from that of its own politics of writing, which have geared the author towards experimenting with the traditional, feminine and introspective, diary mode in view <b>of</b> <b>forwarding</b> his <b>opinions</b> on perennial, yet acutely contemporary issues such as the state and the constraints it incurs, democracy, anarchism, terrorism, doctrine; on breaking news issues like avian influenza or Al-Qaida; but also on lighter topics such as music, the body, tourism, language use or authority in fiction. On the one hand, the reading thus discloses Coetzee’s affiliation to certain patterns of Western philosophical thinking, which he either follows closely, or confutes passionately.

40|$|We use a {{panel of}} more than 100, 000 {{investor}} accounts in US stocks over the period 1991 - 1995 to construct an investor-based measure <b>of</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion,</b> unlike the analyst based measure used in the literature. We use this measure to test two competing hypotheses: the sidelined investors hypothesis and the uncertainty/asymmetric information hypothesis. We find evidence that supports the sidelined-investors hypothesis. We show that the dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> <b>of</b> the investors in a stock is positively related to the contemporaneous returns and trading volume of the stock and negatively related to its future returns. Moreover, dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> aggregates across many stocks and generates factors that have a market-wide effect, affecting the stock equilibrium rate of return and providing additional explanatory power in a standard asset-pricing model. This supports the interpretation <b>of</b> dispersion <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> as a risk factor.

This {{dissertation}} seeks to confront the challenges associated with opinion mining and sentiment analysis by investigating three aspects <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> expression and consumption in social media. The universality <b>of</b> <b>opinion</b> itself is explored through an innovative application of social science research in survey construction, semantic distance analysis, and corpus linguistics. Results include a universal taxonomy of 18 sentiment types shown to be portable across 15 languages.
