Multifractal structure to space-time fluctuations and the associated <b>inverse</b> <b>power</b> law form for power spectra is generic to spatially extended dynamical systems in nature and is a signature of self-organized criticality. The exact physical mechanism for the observed self-organized criticality is not yet identified. The author has developed a general systems theory where quantum mechanical laws emerge as self-consistent explanations for the observed long-range space-time correlations, i. e. the apparently chaotic fractal fluctuations are signatures of quantum-like chaos in dynamical systems.
