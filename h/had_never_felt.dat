Due to the Beaneaters' solid, four-man starting pitching rotation of Nichols, Klobedanz, Lewis, and rookie Vic Willis, his role {{with the team}} {{was expected to be}} as an extra outfielder. Stivetts claimed that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> better in his life and his outlook on the up-coming season was positive.|$|E
5|$|Pam asks Jim {{to talk to}} {{her father}} and {{convince}} him to work things out with her mother. But shortly after they talk, Pam learns her father has sought a separation and will be looking for his own apartment. Pam assumes it is because of something Jim said to her father, and blames him for their breakup. Pam later confronts her father about why he left her mother while Jim looks on through the window. Pam returns to the office and tells Jim her father left because Jim told him how much he loves Pam, and he realized that he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that way about her mother even at their best. Pam comes to terms with the separation and tearfully embraces Jim. Later, she expresses confidence that the two are true soul mates. Andy overhears her comments about her real life scenario, still thinks she is talking about the film they watched and concludes that he cannot be a movie critic because he is not as insightful as Jim and Pam.|$|E

25|$|Within the new canton of Oberland, {{historic}} {{borders and}} traditional rights were not considered. As {{there had been}} no previous separatist feeling amongst the conservative population, there was little enthusiasm for the new order. The situation in the canton of Léman was quite different. The French-speaking Vaudois <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> like part of the German-speaking Canton of Bern. When they joined the Swiss Confederation in 1803, it was as the Canton of Vaud.|$|E

500|$|Leslie Uggams {{said that}} she was in the film in July 2015, portraying Blind Al. Tim Miller stated that Jed Rees portrays [...] "The Recruiter", and [...] "did a good job of being creepy and syrupy sweet." [...] Miller {{explained}} that Colossus would be a solely CGI creation in the film because, as a fan of the character, he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> that Cudmore's version was accurate to the comics and wanted to show the character as [...] "this monstrous guy". Andre Tricoteux had been cast in the role, providing motion reference on set and the voice. In December, the voice of Colossus was revealed to have been recast, with Stefan Kapičić taking over the role. He completed his work eight weeks before the film was scheduled for release.|$|E
500|$|In the 1970s, Laucke {{moved to}} New York City to further his career. He {{was asked by}} Valdès-Blain if he would mind sharing his one-room {{apartment}} with flamenco guitarist Paco deLucía. Laucke taught deLucía music by Bach and Villa-Lobos. In return, deLucía showed Laucke some of the secrets of his art of flamenco, an oral tradition handed down through generations, [...] "their secrets and knowledge jealously guarded". Although Laucke had played flamenco for his own pleasure {{since he was a}} child, he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> comfortable playing it in public. De Lucía's influence helped change this: [...] "This meeting changed my life," [...] Laucke [...] declared, [...] "he taught me flamenco works which were not written anywhere and to which no other guitarist had access. So for me to be taught all these techniques by a guitarist of Paco's caliber was an incredible stroke of luck". (English translation) ...|$|E
500|$|Michael Gorra, a {{professor}} of English literature, argues that Faulks seeks to demonstrate that [...] "the past can be recovered, its code can be broken; {{it can be used}} to add meaning to contemporary life. Its limitations can be overcome and its promises fulfilled because we know it can heal." [...] The deliberate hiding of Stephen's stories, remaining silent to his family after the war's end and encoding his journals, mirrors the actual loss of record and stories from veterans in post-war Britain. Elizabeth's search for that history is a process of recovering that memory in order to gain a greater emotional relationships with her grandfather, to whom she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> connected. Writing in the British Medical Journal, the medical doctor Paul Slade described reading about this investigation of another person's history to illuminate how [...] "superficial" [...] his own patient histories practice had been.|$|E

500|$|In 1984, Bannon's {{books were}} {{featured}} in the documentary Before Stonewall about how {{gay men and lesbians}} lived prior to the 1969 Stonewall riots, wherein one woman remembered picking up one of Bannon's books for the first time: [...] "I picked up this paperback and I opened it up... and it sent a shiver of excitement in my whole body that I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> before." [...] She was {{featured in the}} Canadian documentary [...] in 1992, which recounted women's personal stories of living as lesbians from the 1940s to 1960s. The books were selected for the Quality Paperback Book Club in 1995. Bannon also provided the foreword for Strange Sisters: The Art of Lesbian Pulp Fiction 1949–1969 in 1999, discussing her reaction to the artwork on her own books and the other lesbian pulp fiction books she bought and read. Five of The Beebo Brinker Chronicles were reissued by Cleis Press again between 2001 and 2003—excluding The Marriage—with autobiographical forewords that described Bannon's experiences of writing the books and her reaction to their popularity, causing another wave of interest.|$|E

2500|$|Because {{there were}} no roads to Whatcom, the Judsons rode a mail {{steamboat}} to Bellingham Bay, where they transferred to canoes up the Nooksack River paddled by a Nooksack Indian couple named Sally and Joe. The journey up the Nooksack took two days because of two log jams, called the Big Jam (which was ¾ of a mile long) and the Little Jam. The Patterson property had a small log cabin and a milk barn {{on the cusp of}} a plateau near the north bank of the Nooksack, with a view of Mount Baker and the Twin Sisters. Squahalish, Sally and Joe's encampment, was on the opposite bank. Judson later said a [...] "sense of satisfaction came over" [...] her at this location which she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>felt</b> at any other home. The Judsons built a larger, two storey house, using Patterson's original as the kitchen. Once their presence became known, Lizzie Patterson returned to see her children and died shortly after.|$|E
