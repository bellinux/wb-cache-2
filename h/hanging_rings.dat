50|$|What {{is known}} as the Old McCulloch County Jail is {{actually}} the second structure to serve as the county jail. The first jail was built soon after the county's 1876 official organization, the structure having been completed in 1878. The construction on the first jail proved to be of poor quality, and McCulloch's prisoners were eventually incarcerated in Mason and San Saba. A new facility was approved by the Commissioner's Court in 1908, and completed in 1910 at a cost of $14,418.75. Construction of the three-story, red brick Richardson Romanesque facility was done by Southern Structural Steel Company of San Antonio. The second floor housed the prisoners, while the first floor served as living quarters for the sheriff and his family, or for the deputies. The third floor consists of twin towers. The underside of the third floor had a <b>hanging</b> <b>ring,</b> with a second floor trap door to facilitate death by hanging. In both 1936 and 1938, Brady Creek (San Saba River) overflowed its banks and caused the living quarters to be flooded. When the county decided to build a newer facility in 1974, this jail became known as the Old McCulloch County Jail.|$|R
