500|$|Ike and Tina began {{a sexual}} {{relationship}} in 1959, much to Tina's chagrin. Ike also felt guilt over the relationship, stating later that having sex with Tina <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{having sex with a}} sibling. Recalling to Rolling Stone in 1986, {{the first time she had}} sex with Ike Tina said, [...] "He had broken up with the mother of his two sons, who I ended up raising. He was without a girlfriend. One of the musicians said he was going to come to my room and have sex with me. I couldn't lock the door, so I went to sleep with Ike, thinking he would protect me. Shit! It happened then, but I thought, 'Well, okay, I'll just do it once.' Didn't really know what to do because I wasn't turned on to him, even though it was good." [...] In her book, Tina stated the couple married in Tijuana, in 1962. She recalled the first time Ike physically abused her began after she told him she was considering leaving Ike's group due to financial disputes and their own confusing relationship. Tina said Ike grabbed a shoe stretcher and hit her in the head with it. Afterwards, Tina said, Ike asked her to have sex with him. Tina wrote in her memoirs, I, Tina, that the incident was the first time Ike had [...] "instilled fear" [...] in her.|$|E
2500|$|Gable was {{considered}} {{for the role of}} Tarzan in Tarzan the Ape Man, but lost out to Johnny Weissmuller's more imposing physique and superior swimming prowess. However, Gable's unshaven lovemaking with braless Jean Harlow in Red Dust (1932) soon made him MGM's most important male star. After the hit Hold Your Man (1933), MGM recognized the goldmine of the Gable-Harlow pairing, putting them in two more films, China Seas (1935; with Gable and Harlow billed above Wallace Beery) and Wife vs. Secretary (1936) with Myrna Loy and James Stewart. An enormously popular combination, on-screen and off-screen, Gable and Harlow made six films together, the most notable being Red Dust (1932) and Saratoga (1937). Harlow died during production of Saratoga. Ninety percent completed, the remaining scenes were filmed with long shots or the use of doubles like Mary Dees; Gable said that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> [...] "in the arms of a ghost".|$|E
2500|$|Vase with Zinnias and Geraniums (F241) {{reflects}} {{the influence of}} Adolphe Monticelli (1824–1886) in its vivid color and impasto paint. [...] Van Gogh admired, and later collected, Monticelli's work. [...] Van Gogh had been introduced by his brother Theo to Monticelli's still life work with flowers in Paris. [...] He admired Monticelli's use of color as an expansion of Delacroix's theories of color and contrast. [...] Secondly he admired the effect Monticelli created by heavy application of paint called [...] "impasto". It was partially Monticelli, from Marseilles, who inspired Van Gogh's southerly move to Provence in 1888. [...] He felt such kinship for the man, and desire to emulate his style, that {{he wrote in a}} letter to his sister Wil that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> [...] "Monticelli's son or his brother." [...] The first owner in the provenance of this painting is [...] "C.M. van Gogh Gallery, Amsterdam, The Netherlands", which was owned by Van Gogh's uncle and an art dealer, Cornelius Marinus van Gogh (1824–1908).|$|E
60|$|Paul found it, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{must stand}} to read such praise.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had struck}} her {{directly}} he uttered that last word.|$|R
60|$|Mr Wegg replied, with literal exactness, that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had had a}} turn.|$|R
60|$|With that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{rooted to}} the spot and could not move.|$|E
6000|$|Lord Cosham {{talked to}} Norman, who <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> being patronised on false pretences, drew into his shell, and {{displayed}} {{none of his}} [...] "first-rate abilities." ...|$|E
6000|$|She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{now looking}} at her very hard indeed, and also {{as if she had}} grown ever so much older. [...] "I'll do {{anything}} in the world you ask me, papa." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{she walked}} away from him. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had trapped her. He was angry and depressed, he felt again despised.|$|R
60|$|Going {{through a}} similar stretch-yawny process, his brother Norrak said that <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{strength}} {{to turn a}} walrus inside out.|$|R
60|$|Louise {{raised her}} clear eyes to his, without reproach, indignation, or even wonder. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{attempted}} an insult and failed.|$|R
60|$|His {{leaning against}} the chimney-piece {{reminded}} him of the night with the whelp. It was the self-same chimney-piece, and somehow he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> the whelp to-night. He could make no way at all.|$|E
60|$|Then they quickened their pace, and capered for joy at {{the thought}} of the savory banquet at which they hoped to be guests. But Eurylochus told them that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> walking in a dream.|$|E
60|$|Roberts {{shook his}} head. The matter was, to his mind, far too serious to be joked about, {{and he almost}} <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> acting in a treasonable sort of way in aiding to carry out such a project.|$|E
6000|$|... "When Tom {{tells the}} truth it's a fact every time, Hans," [...] {{answered}} Sam, who <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> would choke from suppressed laughter.|$|R
60|$|Pony {{said he was}} {{not sick}} at all; just tired; and that was true; <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to get up again.|$|R
6000|$|... "He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> weighed {{about forty}} {{when he was}} in the water," [...] {{returned}} Darry, a little crest-fallen that the catch was not larger.|$|R
60|$|Merlin {{had become}} livid under the grime on his face. With this ill-kempt sansculotte giant {{in front of}} him, he almost <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> already arraigned before that awful, merciless tribunal, {{to which he had}} dragged so many {{innocent}} victims.|$|E
60|$|When Miriam, {{returning}} to the mother-of-pearl music-stool, at a signal from her brother, touched the silver and enamelled keys of the ivory piano, and began to sing, Lord Codlingsby <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> listening {{at the gates of}} Paradise, or were hearing Jenny Lind.|$|E
60|$|John {{talked a}} little about the trains on the road, and the weather, but talk was an effort to him also. As he rode he thought of it all again. He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> losing his heart, but he did not waver.|$|E
6000|$|... "How {{beautiful}} {{everything is}} to-day!" [...] he said, {{as he stepped}} to her side. <b>He</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had said, [...] "How beautiful you are!" ...|$|R
60|$|Not {{until he}} was some {{distance}} away did he draw a deep breath. Somehow <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had just emerged from a prison cell.|$|R
6000|$|Felix <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had {{hit that}} face. Still, {{anything}} {{was better than}} to leave him under this gruesome obsession! Then, to his consternation, Derek stood up and said: ...|$|R
60|$|Burgess passed on, {{his mind}} full of Bob once more. What hard luck it was! There was he, dashing {{about in the}} sun to improve his fielding, {{and all the time}} the team was filled up. He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> playing some low trick on a pal.|$|E
6000|$|... "When he {{was driven}} from Massachusetts," [...] said Laurence, [...] "and began his {{journey into the}} woods, he must have <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> burying himself forever from the sight and {{knowledge}} of men. Yet the whole country has now heard of him, and will remember him forever." ...|$|E
60|$|This {{was quite}} an unusual burst {{on the part of}} Queeker, who felt as though he were making some amends for his unfaithfulness in thus recalling and emphatically asserting the unquestionably good qualities of his lady-love. He <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> {{honestly}} attempting to win himself back to his allegiance.|$|E
6000|$|... "He told me <b>he</b> <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{owed it to}} us to gain {{something}} for himself, since I had given up the Randall to gratify him--a pretty sort of gratification." ...|$|R
50|$|His bio {{indicated}} that Skid-Z was {{a follower of}} the charismatic cult leader Predacon. Always a misfit, Skid-Z <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> finally belonged with Predacon's group. Unfortunately, while he believed wholeheartedly in Predacon's philosophy, he was incompatible for the organics grafting process Predacon used on his followers to make them technorganic. Although the charismatic leader professed to be fine with this, Skid-Z <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had let down his partner. He has a distinct rivalry with Predacon's other Mini-Con partner Side Burn, whose organic grafting took perfectly. Of course, Skid-Z does not know his rival is a spy for the Autobots.|$|R
6000|$|Sewell <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} preaching {{to a dead}} wall; but now the wall opened, and a voice came out of it, saying: [...] "You mean {{something}} to occupy their minds?" ...|$|R
6000|$|A groan startled her. Then {{came the}} passage and the unhappy man's history {{with a sudden}} stab. A horror of the {{darkness}} fell on her. She <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> in the prison and she reproaching him, and cried out--"O sir, forgive me. I forgot; I did not say it on purpose." ...|$|E
60|$|He stood, for a moment, {{with the}} blood so {{tingling}} through all his veins from terror, that he <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> in a burning fire; then, confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he did, made off {{as fast as he}} could lay his feet to the ground.|$|E
60|$|Name of a name! {{when that}} damnable English spy was {{actually}} in his power, {{the man was a}} pusillanimous fool to allow the rich prize to slip from his grasp! Chauvelin <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> <b>were</b> choking; his slender fingers worked nervily around his cravat; beads of perspiration trickled unheeded down his pallid forehead.|$|E
60|$|It was {{certainly}} a trying situation, and as he {{stepped out into the}} snow Andy <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> never wanted to go back and never wanted to see his Uncle Si again.|$|R
6000|$|Newman <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> {{had been}} reading by starlight the report of highly {{important}} evidence in a great murder case. [...] "And the paper--the paper!" [...] he said, excitedly. [...] "What was written upon it?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Perhaps you wouldn't," [...] said Nora. [...] "I've {{heard one}} rich man {{say that the}} {{applications}} made to him for money were so numerous that he was quite annoyed, and <b>felt</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> was goin' to become bankrupt!" ...|$|R
