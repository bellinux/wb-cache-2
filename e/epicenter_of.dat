5|$|The entire {{colonnade}} of {{the temple}} collapsed in a devastating June 4, 1679 earthquake, the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> which was, according to many scholars, located in gorge of Garni. Most of the original building blocks remained scattered at the site, allowing the building to be reconstructed.|$|E
5|$|When {{a second}} {{simultaneous}} set of earthquakes occur, the parallel universe's version of Nick Lane (David Call) approaches Agent Lincoln Lee (Seth Gabel) {{of the prime}} universe, believing {{him to be the}} parallel universe's version of Lee. Lee feigns familiarity, learning that Nick had visions of being at the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the quake before it began. When Lee reports this to Olivia Dunham (Anna Torv) in the prime universe, she suddenly recalls her Cortexiphan trials including fellow subject Nick Lane, and with the team's help, identifies that other Cortexiphan subjects are the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> these quakes, linking to their parallel universe versions to achieve synchronization.|$|E
5|$|After Jones makes another {{unsuccessful}} {{attempt to}} open a doorway at a soccer field in Providence, Olivia searches through old case files related to science and unexplained phenomena, and discovers a geographic connection between the soccer field, the city street, and several of their past Fringe cases. Olivia and Walter {{come to the same}} conclusion, that Jones is going to use a site at Reiden Lake to reopen the doorway, the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> these Fringe events. Olivia, Peter, and Walter intercept Jones while he is opening another window and is halfway through it. Peter triggers Walter's device, killing Jones by sealing the doorway.|$|E

5|$|By 6May, a {{total of}} five light {{aftershocks}} had occurred near the earthquake's <b>epicenter.</b> <b>Of</b> the five, the first registered a magnitude of 3.7(ML) and struck about 15 minutes after the main shock, and was succeeded by a magnitude 3.9(ML) tremor at 10:09 local time. Two similar quakes of minor intensity struck the region the next day; however, the strongest and final aftershock registered a magnitude of 4.1(ML) and occurred at 04:00 in the morning.|$|E
5|$|Ethan Gutmann, citing Falun Gong {{allegations}} that Liaoning was the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> organ harvesting from practitioners while Bo was governor, {{suggested that he}} may have used his involvement as a way of building up his political power. David Kilgour, who co-wrote the Kilgour–Matas report on organ harvesting, accused Bo of playing a role. Separately, Falun Gong practitioners abroad filed over ten lawsuits against Bo alleging torture and crimes against humanity In 2009, a Spanish court indicted Bo Xilai and four other officials for genocide against Falun Gong.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} its number of openly gay politicians, gay wedding ceremonies, pride events and gay-inclusive {{religious}} organizations relative {{to the size of}} the total population of the city, Minneapolis has one of the largest LGBT populations in the U.S. Noted for its strong music and performing arts scenes, Minneapolis is home to both the award-winning Guthrie Theater and the historic First Avenue nightclub. Reflecting the region's status as an <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> folk, funk, and alternative rock music, the city served as the launching pad for several of the 20th century's most influential musicians, including Bob Dylan and Prince.|$|E
30|$|Taking {{into account}} the close {{relationship}} between large earthquakes and active faults, we focus on <b>epicenters</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes with a magnitude ≥ 5.0 at a shallow depth as the conditional group. It {{may be possible to}} adopt fault zones as a conditional group, but <b>epicenters</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes are more exactly defined and more easily selected than fault zones. Even with these simple selections, we are able to construct a seismicity model that could possibly assess the seismogenesis of shallow earthquakes. It may be possible to propose more effective models after various predictive parameters have been examined. However, how such models would perform remains to be seen.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we discuss}} the {{difference}} in distributions between larger and smaller after-shocks that followed some large earthquakes with magnitude larger than 7 at trenches of thePacific Ocean. By a method similar to the t-test, it seems probable that the epicenters ofthe smaller shocks are located slightly landward in comparison {{with those of the}} larger shocks,especially in South Kuril and Philippine. On the statistic basis mentioned above, <b>epicenters</b> <b>of</b> the main shocks are compared withthose of their aftershocks. It is ascertained that most <b>of</b> <b>epicenters</b> <b>of</b> the main shocks withreversal dip-slip fault are situated iandward, except the events in New Britain Trench andNew Hebrides...|$|R

The <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the quake was just outside the Haitian capital Port-au-Prince. Over 230,000 civilians have been confirmed dead by the Haitian government because of the disaster and around 300,000 have been injured. Approximately 1.2 million people are homeless and {{it has been reported that}} the lack of temporary shelter may lead to the outbreak of disease.|$|E
5|$|On July 29, 1967, McCain was a {{lieutenant}} commander {{when he was}} near the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the USS Forrestal fire. He escaped from his burning jet {{and was trying to}} help another pilot escape when a bomb exploded; McCain was struck in the legs and chest by fragments. The ensuing fire killed 134sailors and took 24hours to control. With the Forrestal out of commission, McCain volunteered for assignment with the , another aircraft carrier employed in Operation Rolling Thunder. Once there, he would be awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and the Bronze Star Medal for missions flown over North Vietnam.|$|E
5|$|Presidents Hall– One of {{the oldest}} {{buildings}} on campus and a flagship of the University, Presidents Hall was completed in 1867. Located at the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the main campus, Presidents Hall is a neo-gothic structure dressed in brownstone. It originally served as a seminary but now houses the University’s administration including the Office of the University President. The halls are lined with portraits of past University presidents and include a large stained glass depicting Saint Elizabeth Ann Seton, which was commissioned in 1866 by President Bayley.|$|E

5|$|The kibbutz was {{established}} in 1926 by pioneers from the Hashomer Hatzair movement, who moved to Mandatory Palestine during the Third Aliyah from Poland. It was the first Jewish settlement {{in the southern part}} of the Jezreel Valley. It soon became a center of the Hashomer Hatzair, particularly since the first regional school of the Kibbutz Arzi network was set up there. In April 1948 the kibbutz was the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> an important battle when it successfully resisted the first large-scale attack of the Arab Liberation Army commanded by Fawzi al-Qawuqji.|$|E
5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had ripped the heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his official cult, Unas was deified and became a local god of the Saqqara necropolis. Grimal attributes this directly to the grandeur of his funerary complex. Malek doubts {{the existence of a}} popular cult of Unas during the Old Kingdom but acknowledges it from the Middle Kingdom onwards. He attributes this Middle Kingdom revival to the geographic position of Unas' complex making it a natural gateway to the Saqqara necropolis. The popular cult of the deified Unas continued for nearly 2,000 years as shown by the numerous scarabs bearing Unas' name found in Saqqara and dated from the New Kingdom (c.1550c.1077 BC) until the Late Period (664332 BC). The <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> this cult was not the pyramid of Unas nor the associated mortuary temple but rather the statues of the king in the valley temple.|$|E

5|$|Skanderbeg's {{primary reason}} for allying with Alfonso was his fear of 21-year-old Mehmed II, whose {{ambition}} was to reconquer Justinian I's empire which stretched from Syria to Spain. Mehmed had been planning a campaign against Albania since Skanderbeg had defeated his father at Krujë in 1450. Another factor was that Krujë geographically dominated Durazzo, which was only 150 kilometers from Brindisi, the nearest Italian port. Mehmed's ambitions were symmetrical to Alfonso's {{and it was clear}} that there would be some sort of clash between the two in Albania, the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the conflict. Mehmed {{was one of the first}} monarchs since Roman times to keep a massive centralized army under his personal control. Besides controlling a huge army, Mehmed was widely acknowledged for his far-reaching wisdom which allowed him to produce a highly advanced military armed with the newest models of the cannon.|$|E
5|$|Temporary {{space was}} {{needed in the}} interim, and the school {{relocated}} its 550 fourth through ninth grade students to rented space in Roselawn, the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> Cincinnati's Jewish Community. The school was divided between two buildings, the Yavneh Day School building at 1636 Summit Road and the nearby Jewish Community Center. The Yavneh Day school, founded in 1952 by parents who wanted to combine secular and Jewish education for their children, moved to Roselawn in 1958 but had outgrown that facility. The school had no lockers; students carried their belongings between buildings. Lunches were delivered from another school and served at a nearby church.|$|E
5|$|The {{physical}} {{distance between}} the two civilizations has also been {{used to assess the}} cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact. Historical examples show that the greater the distance, the less the contacted civilization perceives a threat to itself and its culture. Therefore, contact occurring within the Solar System, and especially in the immediate vicinity of Earth, {{is likely to be the}} most disruptive and negative for humanity. On a smaller scale, people close to the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> contact would experience a greater effect than would those living farther away, and a contact having multiple epicenters would cause a greater shock than one with a single epicenter. Space scientists Martin Dominik and John Zarnecki state that in the absence of any data on the nature of extraterrestrial intelligence, one must predict the cultural impact of extraterrestrial contact on the basis of generalizations encompassing all life and of analogies with history.|$|E

50|$|The Guy-Greenbrier {{earthquake}} swarm occurred in central Arkansas beginning in August 2010. The <b>epicenters</b> <b>of</b> earthquakes in the swarm showed a linear distribution, {{with a clear}} overall shift in activity towards the southwest with time, and the largest event in the swarm was the 2011 Arkansas earthquake, at 4.7 on the moment magnitude scale.|$|R
5|$|A major {{earthquake}} {{occurs in}} Los Angeles, caused by terrorists detonating explosives at focal points (places where fault lines intersect). Kate Warner is also kidnapped by the terrorist cell, along with Governor James Radford who is kidnapped for assassination but is then rescued by the CTU. A conspiracy involving Radford in the day's attacks is uncovered by the CTU and Radford is {{killed by the}} terrorist cell because he attempts to back out. Fort Lesker, U.S. Military base and the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the earthquakes, is attacked and taken over by terrorists, who then begin stealing weapons-grade plutonium before attempting to smuggle the weapons out of the U.S. to the Middle East. Kate Warner's father is forced to aid the terrorists by helping them smuggle the weapons with his customs passes. Jack finally kills Madsen {{when he tries to}} escape by shooting his speedboat with an M-80 assault rifle, causing it to explode. He also shoots and kills Max, the man behind the events of Season 2 and The Game, who was holding Kate Warner hostage, saving her life but in doing so Max manages to shoot Jack once in the stomach before dying. As a result, Chase Edmunds takes Jack to the hospital via helicopter.|$|E
5|$|At Lebec, California, {{just south}} of the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> the July mainshock, the San Andreas Fault comes {{together}} with the Garlock Fault, which is positioned at the northern border of the Mojave Desert. The San Andreas has been responsible for considerable seismic activity at its northern and southern sections, and traverses the area near the Transverse Ranges. The Kern Canyon Fault mirrors the path of the Kern River, and was thought to have a connection with the White Wolf Fault, but indicators observed following the July 21 earthquake demonstrated that the two are offset. The Owens Valley Fault, {{on the east side of}} the Sierran block, has been mapped and may possibly extend into area that was affected by the 1952 shocks. Other fault zones are present in the region, and have been of interest because they may have been responsible for minor earthquakes, but they are considered not as significant as the Kern Canyon, Owens Valley, and San Andreas Faults.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of Constantinople served {{as one of}} Constantine's most lasting accomplishments, shifting Roman power eastward as the city became a center of Greek culture and Christianity. Numerous churches were built across the city, including the Hagia Sophia which was built {{during the reign of}} Justinian the Great and remained the world's largest cathedral for a thousand years. Constantine also undertook a major renovation and expansion of the Hippodrome of Constantinople; accommodating tens of thousands of spectators, the hippodrome became central to civic life and, in the 5th and 6th centuries, the <b>epicenter</b> <b>of</b> episodes of unrest, including the Nika riots. Constantinople's location also ensured its existence would stand the test of time; for many centuries, its walls and seafront protected Europe against invaders from the east and the advance of Islam. During most of the Middle Ages, {{the latter part of the}} Byzantine era, Constantinople was the largest and wealthiest city on the European continent and at times the largest in the world.|$|E

This location of the VLFEs may be explained as a reactivation in the outer part (|Strike|[*]>[*] 80  km), as shown in Figure  4 c. Figures  3 a and 4 c also suggest a quiescence of the VLFEs around the center of strong plate coupling, which may correspond {{to the fact that}} VLF after-events were not observed off Miyagi (Matsuzawa et al. 2012). We can also expect activation off Iwate, {{on the opposite side of}} the main source region, which gives us a clue for finding previously undiscovered VLFEs from very large events.|$|R
