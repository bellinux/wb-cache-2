It deals with the so-called worst variant of the accident { [...] } leakage of the maximum possible amount of the substance. The introduction {{is devoted to the}} legislation concerning the <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substance,</b> prevention of serious accidents, components of the integrated rescue system and the fire prevention. The thesis contains the characteristics and the description of ammonia as dangerous substance, with focus on its toxicity and it analyses the results of a possible leakage. For the simulation of a possible accident, the software instrument TerEx was applied. The calculations acquired after entering the input data into the program served for determination of the zone where the detrimental concentration of ammonia would reach in case of a leakage. In comparison with the original calculations performed in the last years applying the ROZEX programme, the zone with a harmful concentration would be substantially extended. The results of the thesis should be taken into consideration in the emergency plan of the region and in the emergency plan of the Eggenberg a. s., Brewery, however, also the procedure of the intervention of the integrated rescue system components shall be specified. Moreover the way of performing the inspections in the section of the fire protection in subjects applying, processing or storing dangerous chemical substances and preparations is drafted.

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} {{transportation}} of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> in road transport in the Czech Republic. The paper was elaborated {{on the basis}} of available literature focused on transportation of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances,</b> especially on the European Agreement concerning the International Carriage of Dangerous Goods by Road. This Agreement is the crucial document for transportation of dangerous goods both in the Czech Republic and in all states, which acceded to this Agreement. The objective of the paper is assessing the implementation of the European regulations into the regulations of the Czech Republic and mapping the awareness of the public about issues of the transportation of dangerous goods in road transport. By processing specialized literature about this topic, it was found out that the implementation of the European regulations into the regulations of the Czech Republic was very flexible and fast. On the basis of the quantitative research by means of a questionnaire research among the public and drivers working in the transportation of dangerous goods it was found out that the public did not have sufficient information about the transportation of dangerous goods in road transport. On the contrary, drivers transporting dangerous goods are excellently familiar with this issue. With respect {{to the fact that the}} public has not enough information about the transportation of dangerous goods, the public administration should provide more pieces of information in the form of leaflets and promotion events. Furthermore, it would be appropriate to include basic information about transporting dangerous substances focused especially on conduct in case of traffic accidents of vehicles transporting dangerous substances into the courses and follow-up training at driving schools.

40|$|Purpose. This {{research}} {{focuses on}} the development of an applied numerical model to calculate the dynamics of atmospheric pollution in the emission of dangerous chemical substances in the event of transportation by railway. Methodology. For the numerical simulation of transport process of the <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> in the atmosphere the equation of convection-diffusion pollutant transport is used. This equation takes into account the effect of wind, atmospheric diffusion, the power of emission source, as well as the movement of the source of emission (depressurized tank) on the process of pollutant dispersion. When carrying out computing experiment one also takes into account the profile of the speed of the wind flow. For the numerical integration of pollutant transport in the atmosphere implicit finite-difference splitting scheme is used. The numerical calculation is divided into four steps of splitting and at each step of splitting the unknown value of the concentration of hazardous substance is determined by the explicit running account scheme. On the basis of the numerical model it was created the code using the algorithmic language FORTRAN. One conducted the computational experiments to assess the level of air pollution near the railway station «Illarionovo» {{in the event of a}} possible accident during transportation of ammonia. Findings. The proposed model allows you to quickly calculate the air pollution after the emission of chemically hazardous substance, taking into account the motion of the emission source. The model makes it possible to determine the size of the land surface pollution zones and the amount of pollutants deposited on a specific area. Using the developed numerical model it was estimated the environmental damage near the railway station «Illarionovo». Originality. One can use the numerical model to calculate the size and intensity of the chemical contamination zones after accidents on transport. Practical value. The numerical model, developed by authors, can be used to estimate the size and intensity of the chemical contamination zones during emergency on transport.

40|$|This {{bachelor}} work {{is called}} qAlcoholism by adolescents". It describes how relation of teenagers to alcohol {{is influenced by}} society, family, their free time and peers. In a particular chapter of this work each factor is described. Alcoholism has been a social problem for many years. Alcohol is very <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> especially for adolescents, because the addiction makes up faster and infleunces their health more seriously than {{the health of the}} adults. After some drinks usual behaviour may be changed, the person can lose inhibition or starts talking more freely. On the other hand, he or she may become aggresive or depressed. In the worse situation a man may come to comatose or a man can even die. The studies have shown that teenagers who abuse alcohol [...] in comparison with some of their peers - have problems with memory, learning and other brain activities. However if the drinking continues auting young adulthood, the damage of brain may grow and become too dangerous. It can lead to the brain disorder. Alcohol is regarded being a tolerated soft drug in the Czech Republic. Therefore alcohol is available for adolescents. Teenagers can often find it at home. That´s why family enviroment connected with upbriginng {{can be one of the}} most important factors which influences consumation of alcohol by adolescents. The object of this research was the first contact of teenagers with alcohol. At what opportunity they drink alcohol at the present time, how often they drink and how they spend their leissure time. Whether they spend their leissure time only with their friends or with their parents too. Research was provided by the questionnaire form.

40|$|The {{aim of the}} diploma {{thesis is}} to assess {{contamination}} by <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> of selected operating premises at the FRS stations of the Pardubice Region. Elevated contamination by <b>dangerous</b> <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> of the mentioned premises can be results of many factors, from technical to organisational ones, and as a final consequence of this, it may influence firefighters´ health negatively. The theoretical part of the thesis presents basic information about the organisation, duties and securing the operability of chemical and technical services material equipment. Furthermore, knowledge of possible risks of contamination of material equipment and about inspections of the chemicals in operating environment are presented. In the survey part, air contamination of 13 selected areas is assessed during everyday operations and once in an intentionally contaminated area. As the measuring procedure in all the selected areas, air sampling through adsorption tube with Tenax sorbent was used. Specifying the <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> in the samples is implemented by the means of a thermodesorption equipment and a gas chromatograph with a mass spectrometer.

40|$|The {{topic of}} my thesis is: "Leaks of {{dangerous}} chemical substances {{in the territory}} of the town Pilsen". I have been dealing with this very hot issue, because {{there are more and more}} chemical substances around us. We can find a lot of companies producing, using and having these substances in stock, so we cannot rule out smaller or larger leaks. They usually have negative impacts on human health and life, animals, environment or the leak can cause high material damage. It is necessary to take new measures to decrease results of leak of dangerous chemical substances. In the theoretical part of my work I described some dangerous chemical substances, rules for behaviour and arrangments during the leaks of dangerous chemical substances. In the practical part I evaluated statistic records about leaks of dangerous chemical substances and I valuated talks with experts of public administration in the area of Pilsen town. I carried out my own modulation of ammonia leak in the programme,,TerEx? and by that I gained an area of public danger where I performed an investigation among people. In my work there was verified a hypothesis whether the people living round the object with dangerous chemical substances have some knowledge about the individual protection. I came to conclusion that this hypothesi can be confirmated due to out comes of my questionary research ? our inhabitants are endowed with the needy useful knowledge (as I have been persuaded by).

40|$|The {{aim of this}} diploma {{thesis is}} to {{simulate}} a road accident of a vehicle carrying a chosen <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substance</b> in a chosen city. We chose a crash site based on statistical inquiry {{of the number of}} road accidents. We chose a chemical substance by analyzing substances used {{in the vicinity of the}} chosen city. Through the use of simulation, we described and created a proposition of solving the arose extraordinary event, for the components of Emergency Service units. After completing these objectives, it will be possible to answer the research question: What kind of jeopardy does the leakage of a chosen chemical substance represent, during transportation in a chosen town? The theoretical part firstly focuses on basic terms that we worked with in the thesis. Basic legislative fixing point of dangerous objects and substances is described. Also, European and interstate regulations about transportation of these things is described. European agreement ADR is separately described further away. In the next part, manipulation with dangerous substances and mixtures is described as it is shown in Enactment EP and Council No. 1272 / 2008 /ES, or the enactment of CLP. The characteristics determining their hazardousness, the way of evaluation and classification of dangerous substances and mixtures into corresponding categories is also described. Separately described are ways of packaging and numbering these substances. In the last part, we described the making of a safety list about chemical substances and mixtures, with an emphasis on the information about their transportation. In the next part we described the transportation of dangerous objects and substances on the highway. Further away we described appropriateness and demands for transportation of dangerous substances, for example demands on choosing vehicle personnel, the transportation itself and the equipment that every vehicle must have. We described the risks related with transportation and planning routes for transporting dangerous substances and objects. The aim of the assessments and precautions above are to minimalize risks related to transportation of dangerous substances and thus make it relatively safe. Unfortunately, this is not absolutely possible. This was also found to be true in the empirical part of the thesis, in which we carried out an analysis of the statistics of road accidents of vehicles in the ADR mode, and we found that the human factor is indeed the cause of these accidents. It was proven that 94 % of all the road accidents of vehicles in the ADR mode was caused by the driver of the vehicle. Further away, the number of Emergency Service units interferences in cases of dangerous substance leakage and procedures carried out during those interferences, are described. In the empirical part of the thesis, we described methods of choosing the crash site and the dangerous substance. As a crash site we chose highway I/ 49 in Zlín county, that is evaluated as a highway of medium risk of road accidents, on the road risk map of Czech Republic. More accurately, cross-road of Třída Tomáše Bati and Březnická street in Zlín. When choosing the right substance we conducted an analysis of chemical substance usage in Zlín county. Subsequently we chose aqueous solution of ammoniac, which is being transported on the highway I/ 49 by two companies. It is prepared in IBC containers with the volume of 1000 liters. Acquired data was used for simulation, evaluation of the extraordinary event and for choosing the number of individuals in jeopardy. The simulation was executed using the TerEx software. Subsequently, the proposal for dealing with the extraordinary event by the Emergency Service units was developed. Based on the executed simulation, it is possible to assess that transportation of dangerous substances and mixtures constitutes a great danger in the residential area with a high number of habitable and administrative buildings...|$|E

40|$|In the {{consciousness}} of the inhabitans of the Czech Republic, first of all extraordinary natural events of catastrophic character as floods, fires and an important phenomenon today, windstorms, remain. However, in the last decades, {{as a result of the}} development of economy, we are surrounded more and more by <b>chemical</b> <b>substances,</b> becoming a part of our lives which can cause the occurrence of extraordinary situations, for example during the storage, transport or their usage. They can influence us first of all by the occurrence of possible accidents. For this reason, the goal of this thesis is to elaborate a comprehensive survey and a more detailed characteristic of the most frequently applied or through <b>chemical</b> terrorism misused <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> The system of the protection of inhabitants in the Czech Republic, the tasks of citizens as well as bodies of the public administration, the way of protection financing, co-operation on the international level as well as of individual components of protection of inhabitants as e. g. warning and announcing, evacuation system, emergency survival, shelters, decontamination, individual as well as unpremediated protection are described here. The knowledge of the public in that issue as well as differences in knowledge between intentionally selected age categories were established by means of a questionnaire...|$|R
40|$|The thesis {{deals with}} the issue of {{emergency}} preparedness of Nestlé Česko, s. r. o, Zora Olomouc. According to the Act. No. 224 / 2015 Coll., concerning prevention of major accidents caused by selected <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> or <b>chemical</b> preparations and concerning amendment there is underlimit amount of hazardous chemical ammonia in the area and we cannot classify this as group A or B. On these not-classified resources there are not subject to some duties under this Act, especially the obligation to prepare an emergency documentation. There are a lot of factories like this in the Czech republic (and in the world) and there is certain danger for employees of this companies and for civilian population who is in the danger area. There is more than 6700 kg of ammonia in the factory Zora and it is quite a lot. We have to look at special precautions. Ammonia is taken as moderately toxic substance that irritates the eyes, mucous membranes, and in high concentrations can cause death. Another dangerous effect, except the toxicity is its explosiveness and flammability. Impacts of hazardous concentrations are not threat only for people but also for animals and the environment...|$|R

A small error can cause an accident or even a disaster, and moreover, population, environment and property can be affected. So we have to implement handling and storage of these substances carefully...|$|R
40|$|Our company uses {{more and}} more <b>chemical</b> <b>substances.</b> A lot of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> and formulation, that are used by construction, or they are {{commonly}} used as products for our consumption, must be also stocked and must be transported into stock, factories and operation. Averages related to escape of dangerous substances represent huge hazards, that may threaten health and lifes of people, their property, or they can have negative impact on environment. I will adduce amount of stocked dangerous substances in Central Bohemia //Středočeský kraj// per year 2007 as a proof of {{a huge amount of}} injurants around us. In this work I will make analysis of the most often stocked and transported <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> (amonia, chlorine, hydrogen cyanide). I want to clarify hazards and mainly possible after-effects on health of citizens and on environment, that could start in case of averages with this substances. I will make an analysis of accessible sources (print news, evaluating reports, process case researches, possibilities of resolution of exceptional events, relief and account//liquidation// work) and I will compare them with processed accident and crisis documentation. In this work I would like to emphasize mainly reactions on possible average. I will create model situations with escape of dangerous substances through transportation and through stocking with possible reactions on them. I will use software tool Terex for their evaluation. I will appoint immediate acquisition //arrangements//, relief and account work on a basis of these model situations that must be carried out immediately after escape of dangerous substances and also following acquisition, either short time or long time. At the same time I will suggest preventive acquisition to lower the probability of rise of exceptional events with escape of dangerous substances...|$|R
40|$|Life on {{our planet}} does not exist without risks. Nobody is {{protected}} against extraordinary events and crisis situations. Except for enormous traffic accidents and natural disasters such as floods, fires, windstorms, landslides and avalanches there are also probable accidents with leakage of <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemical</b> <b>substances</b> in the Czech Republic. Above listed probable situations require immediate reaction {{and in many cases}} their solution raises the need of communication with public. In the Czech Republic there was for this purpose created a system of crisis management, which carries out prevention and correction of crisis situations and during crisis outbreak exercises specific procedures leading to reduction of crisis effect. Integral part of activities is the area of information flow (crisis communication) including informedness of general public. The result of above described activity is the plan of communication with public. With respect to the fact that no rule of law solves the content and structure of this document, my proposal results from accessible scientific literature, performed analysis of chosen municipalities and consultation with professionals on this topic. Information is the base of all events, however they are useless if the do not reach these who were they addressed to. That is why their transfer should play the main part when carrying out precautionary measures against extraordinary events and crisis situations {{as well as in the}} time of crisis situation solution...|$|R
40|$|The fast {{innovation}} {{cycle of}} electrical and electronic equipments (EEEs) pose {{the problem of}} a large waste production. The correct disposal of WEEE is strictly needed because of their content in hazardous materials, like heavy metals and environmentally <b>dangerous</b> <b>chemicals,</b> which <b>substances</b> can be very dangerous both for the {{human health and the}} environment in which they are released. Chlorofl uorocarbons (CFCs) are largely present in a particular class of WEEE, cooling and freezing equipment. CFCs are well recognized as ozone-depleting gases and can have an impact on the global warming higher than CO 2. Being Northern Italy the primary source of CFC in Europe, the Italian WEEE Management System development has been investigated, with a focus on cooling and freezing equipment and related CFCs disposal...|$|R
