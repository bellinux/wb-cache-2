40|$|In recent decades, {{there has}} been little {{progress}} in the field of language learning and teaching in translation studies. However, the literature suggests the utility of corpora for language teaching in such context, and particularly Johns’ (1991) data-driven learning (DDL) approach, due to the affordances it offers. Nonetheless, the literature does not suggest how to adopt this approach in translation training settings or, perhaps most importantly, how to combine DDL with other tasks to foster language skills development.

Our NMR metabolomics work has revealed that Ddl is the primary target of DCS, as cell growth is inhibited when the production of D-alanyl-Dalanine is halted.

The NMR data also supports the possibility of a transamination reaction to produce D-alanine from pyruvate and glutamate, thereby bypassing Alr inhibition.

30|$|The first {{important}} factor is task type since not all writing {{problems can be}} solved equally well by DDL approach. In previous studies, DDL is adopted to learn linking adverbials (Boulton 2009; Cotos 2014), to aid learners in generating ideas and writing creatively (Kennedy and Miceli 2010), to distinguish synonym adjectives and solve learners’ problems of overusing general adjectives (Yeh et al. 2007), to learn collocation knowledge and thus help learners produce more accurate and complex language patterns (Thomas 2015). However, it seems that error-correction is the most appropriate task <b>for</b> <b>DDL</b> because a great many studies (e.g. Gaskell and Cobb 2004; Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Tono et al. 2014; Reynolds 2015 a) focused on error-correction or self-editing in writing. For instance, Gaskell and Cobb (2004) explored the immediate effects of adopting DDL in correcting L 2 learners’ sentence-level grammatical errors in writing. The results revealed that concordance evidence for lower-level learners’ grammar development was not as effective as for lexical development. Nevertheless, the results still proved {{the positive effects of}} corpus use since more than 80  % corrections were made accurately when the online concordance links were offered to them while less accurate corrections were made when removing the links. There are another two studies (Chambers and O’Sullivan 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006) focusing on the efficacy of DDL in correcting more various kinds of errors, which include lexico-grammatical errors, capitalization errors, spelling errors, etc. These findings confirmed the advantages of DDL in reducing the interference of the mother tongue, highlighting the awareness of lexico-grammatical patterns and improving the accuracy rate of error corrections. Nevertheless, not all types of errors can be corrected equally well with a DDL approach. Thus more recently, Tono et al. (2014) conducted a research on 93 upper-intermediate undergraduate students, aiming {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} DDL in correcting three coded error types. The results revealed that omission and addition errors were easier to be identified and revised, while mis-formation errors were more difficult to be corrected accurately. These studies indicated that although DDL can be adopted to solve various writing problems, some types of tasks may be more appropriate <b>for</b> <b>DDL</b> thus teachers should carefully consider the appropriateness of tasks while organizing DDL activities.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Distributed Description Logics (DDL) enable {{reasoning}} {{with multiple}} ontologies interconnected by directional semantic mapping, called bridge rules. Bridge rules map concepts of a source ontology into concepts {{of a target}} ontology. Concept subsumptions of the source ontology can be propagated according to a propagation pattern expressed by bridge rules into concept subsumptions of the target ontology. In the basic for-mulation of DDL such a propagation is mostly limited to cases when pairs of ontologies are directly linked by means of bridge rules. However, when more than two ontologies are involved, {{one would expect that}} sub-sumption propagates along chains of ontologies linked by bridge rules, but the semantics of DDL is too weak to support this behaviour. In a recent study, an adjusted semantics <b>for</b> <b>DDL</b> that supports subsump-tion propagation through chains of ontologies has been introduced. This study makes use of so called compositional consistency requirement that has been employed before in Package-based description logics. While the results concerning subsumption propagation under the adjusted seman-tics are encouraging, there are important drawbacks. In this paper we take a wider perspective, and propose a study of several different alter-native extensions of the DDL semantics. For each of them we study the formal properties, and we select the one that, according to our analysis, constitutes a good compromise, and for this case we provide a sound and complete tableaux decision procedure. ...|$|E

30|$|The {{third factor}} to be {{considered}} is language proficiency and training. It is usually believed that DDL may appeal more to advanced learners. Just as shown by O’Sullivan and Chambers (2006), the post-graduates showed {{more positive attitudes toward}} corpus use than the undergraduates. What’s more, Granath (2009) also stated that advanced learners usually benefit more from a DDL approach. Nonetheless, with proper training, DDL could be also effective for lower-level learners as well as advanced learners. As stated by Boulton (2009), for intermediate or lower-level learners, it is crucial to organize the training session to improve their corpus techniques <b>for</b> <b>DDL</b> to be successful. Therefore a lot of studies (e.g. Yoon and Hirvela 2004; O’Sullivan and Chambers 2006; Gilmore 2009; Chang and Sun 2009; Smart 2014) have designed the training session about consultation skills prior to learners’ independent use of corpora. For instance, Gilmore’s (2009) study found that the intermediate-level Japanese university students were able to significantly improve the naturalness of their redrafted essays with a merely 90 -min training about how to use online corpora. Chang and Sun (2009) also showed students performed better in the revision tasks with the aid of scaffolding prompts or teachers’ instructions. In Yoon and Hirvela’s (2004) study, due to receiving more direct training and practice in corpus use, the intermediate students reported fewer problems in corpus search techniques than the advanced students, and they showed more positive attitudes towards corpus use. Although the study conducted by Boulton (2009) proved that lower-level learners could also benefit a lot from DDL in learning linking adverbials in writing without prior training, an overwhelming majority of studies reveal that appropriate training is helpful to maximize the advantages of DDL activities for both lower-level and higher-level students, especially for Asian students who are not accustomed to this exploratory learning approach.|$|E
40|$|An {{increasing}} {{number of studies have}} looked at the value of corpus-based data-driven learning (DDL) for second language (L 2) written error correction, with generally positive results. However, a potential conundrum for language teachers involved in the process is how to provide feedback on students’ written production <b>for</b> <b>DDL.</b> The study looks at DDL-mediated error correction across 61 written samples submitted by 32 tertiary students during a series of short DDL courses. Teachers provided feedback on errors present in the samples, and students highlighted corrections made with or without the corpus. The results suggest that students used corpora to correct errors of word choice, word form, collocations and phrasing, but were less likely to use corpora to correct errors of deletion or morphosyntax. When the corpus was used, students were likely to successfully correct errors of collocation but were less successful for errors of morphosyntax. Post-course questionnaires suggested that perception of the usefulness of DDL for grammar learning was less than that for vocabulary and the learning of phrases, and that time and effort spent on analyzing concordance data and understanding the teacher 2 ̆ 7 s feedback on their writing were perceived as difficulties. To explore these findings further, a qualitative analysis of the feedback teachers provided suggests significant difficulties devising appropriate feedback that promotes autonomous, inductive language acquisition for all error types on the one hand, {{and at the same time}} does not eliminate the need for corpus consultation nor is too vague for students to formulate appropriate corpus queries. This study is therefore an initial yet important step in identifying the type of errors that teachers can address in a timely manner with focused feedback leading to corpus consultation, and how such feedback affects the success of this consultation...|$|E

40|$|Dedifferentiation is {{the process}} by which {{specialised}} quiescent cells give rise to heterotrophic, dividing cells. This process may be initiated in vivo as a response to wounding, or in vitro during culture initiation. This thesis is concerned with evaluating whether the process of dedifferentiation and maintenance of the fast-dividing, dedifferentiated state by culture, is dependant upon major changes in gene expression. In particular, the role of transcription, as mirrored by changes in steady state mRNA levels, in these putative changes in gene expression has been investigated. Mechanically isolated Asparagus officinalis mesophyll cells were used to study dedifferentiating cells, and suspension cultures of Petunia hybrida to investigate the established dedifferentiated state. This thesis shows that dedifferentiation in Asparagus officinalis is accompanied by major changes in the steady state mRNA profiles of the cells. A group of novel transcripts appearing in dedifferentiating asparagus cells were termed DDl, and targeted for further study. Two cDNA clones coding <b>for</b> <b>DDl</b> transcripts were isolated and characterised, and antibodies to DDl raised for serological work. Only minor {{differences were found between the}} steady state mRNA populations of Petunia hybrida cultured cells and seedlings, and these were mainly caused by transcripts disappearing in culture; no transcripts specific to the suspension culture system were detected. The results presented in this thesis are used to foward the hypothesis that changes in gene expression involving de novo transcription may only occur in response to major changes in environmental conditions. It is suggested that the basal transcription pattern for cells in established state is probably common to all cell types with regards to primary cell functions such as growth, division and catabolism. In such established states, the control of metabolism probably resides within the biochemical pathways utilised by the cell at any moment in time...|$|E
30|$|The last {{factor that}} can be never ignored in the {{implementation}} of DDL is the choice of corpora or other Internet resources. The size and type of a corpus may determine the effectiveness of DDL activities. A large and general corpus, such as the Collins COBUILD corpus and British National Corpus (BNC), is often regarded as a good choice <b>for</b> <b>DDL</b> activities due to the massive authentic examples of different usages it could provide. Thus, some studies (e.g. Yoon and Hirvela 2004; Yoon 2008; Gilmore 2009) selected general corpora as reference resources in DDL activities. Some others (e.g. Kennedy and Miceli 2010; Lee and Swales 2006; Chang 2014) preferred to use specialized corpora in academic writing, because this type of corpora can usually provide more effective information about the genres and disciplines in which L 2 learners have to write. Charles (2014) even had learners compile their own corpus, which is proved to be useful in helping learners “get the corpus habit” in writing. In Reynolds’ (2015 b) study, 25 Taiwanese medical students were encouraged to exploit a web-based English/Chinese bilingual parallel corpus collocational concordancer for self-editing their academic writing. In addition to the above-mentioned corpora, web as a corpus and concordancer has also attracted a lot of attention and the search engine is suggested as a super corpus in some studies (Resnik and Smith 2003; Resnik and Elkiss 2005; Sha 2010; Conroy 2010; Brezina 2012; Yoon 2016). These studies revealed the distinctive merits and demerits of different corpora, thus it’s rather difficult to conclude which type of corpora is better. Although some studies (Chang 2014; Sha 2010) compared the usefulness of different types of corpora, this type of empirical studies are relatively few. It’s necessary to find out the appropriate corpora as reference resource for learners. In reality, with the increasing availability of Internet access, the readily available general purpose corpora like BNCweb and the search engine familiar to students are good choices for ordinary teachers and students. BNCweb relies on the Corpus Query Processor (CQP) of the IMS Open Corpus Workbench, providing user-friendly and powerful interface to students (Hoffmann et al. 2008). It is freely accessible to everyone with an Internet connection and enables students who are poor in corpus techniques to exploit corpora just like browsing web pages. The advantages of search-engine-based corpora such as the Linguist’s Search Engine and Google are also obvious due to their usability, search speed and the number of solutions. Learners with different cultural background need to be provided with different reference tools, thus empirical studies are needed to find out the appropriate reference resource for specific learners.|$|E

Students then submitted samples of their thesis writing, receiving highlighted errors of omission, redundancy, collocation, and phrasing as feedback from the teacher, then using the corpus tools to correct these errors in class time. Analyses were performed on the number and type of errors the students were able to correct with/without the corpus software at each stage of training. Students also completed pre- and post-course questionnaires about the effectiveness of using corpora to improve their writing. Results from the writing correction sessions suggest that errors of phrasing or collocation are often successfully resolved by corpus query, but that issues with missing or redundant words in their writing cannot easily be resolved. Moreover, the exact location and scope of the error must be very clearly defined by teachers before students can devise suitable corpus queries. Questionnaire results suggest that students are positive towards using <b>DDL</b> <b>for</b> writing when interfaces are kept simple, corpus query syntax is minimal, and where investment in time is limited, and that students’ ability to create and annotate their own corpora is considered more useful than consulting general or even discipline-specific corpora.

40|$|The PhD activity, {{from which}} this thesis is taken, has been aimed at the design and {{development}} of optical components and subsystems for industrial and biomedical laser applications. Industrial-grade high-power laser market, traditionally dominated by gas and solid state lasers, is currently being revolutionized by two new devices, namely fiber and direct diode lasers, which are partly competing and partly complementary. On the one hand, Fiber Lasers (FLs) make use of rare-earth doped specialty fibers to converted the radiation from semiconductor laser modules (the "pump" source) into a high quality beam at an another wavelength; their strong point is the brightness enhancement, although at the expenses of the conversion efficiency. On the other hand, Direct Diode Lasers (DDLs) rely on the combination of semiconductor laser chips, {{similar to those used}} as pump for FLs, to achieve kilowatt-range output power, which is then delivered to the piece under treatment without the need of further conversion or processing; their strong point is the wall-plug efficiency, while the beam quality is typically low. Different applications may privilege one or the other technological approach: for instance, metal sheet cutting and industrial additive manufacturing from metal powders are more suited for FLs, whereas welding and brazing <b>for</b> <b>DDLs.</b> The first part of the PhD activity have been devoted to the design and development of high power laser systems, yielding to the all-fiber realization of a 600 W single-mode Yb-doped FL module and 500 W to 2000 W low-brightness DDLs. First, different architectural solutions have been investigated and optimized, considering feasibility issues, energy consumption and overall ownership costs. Then, key fiber components, such as fused fiber combiners, cladding mode strippers and laser end-caps, which are usually not commercially available being too dependent on the fiber characteristics and other application related constraints, have been designed fabricated and tested. These devices have been later used to assemble demonstrators of fiber and direct diode laser systems for industrial applications. The implemented FL has reached ~ 600 W of nearly single-modeoutput, with Beam Parameter Product (BPP) less than 0. 54 mm mrad. As <b>for</b> the <b>DDL</b> case, two demonstrators (~ 500 W power with BPP 44. 4 mm mrad and ~ 2 kW power with laser BPP 66. 5 mm mrad) have been realized and engineered. In all the cases, the output power has been limited to available diodes only. The second part of the PhD, and thus of the thesis, has been focused on the laser application in the biomedical field, and in particular to the laser ablation of solid tumors in liver and pancreas. Innovative applicators for laser tumor ablation with customized beam irradiation pattern and integrated all-optical temperature sensing capabilities have been designed and manufactured. The prototypes have been validated in liver phantoms (e. g. agar jelly and porcine livers), demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed solution and encourage further developments toward clinical applications. It is important to highlight that during the PhD the entire chain from design to manufacturing, to applications, has been explored and this has allowed acquiring new skills in different areas, not strictly limited to the main topic of the thesi...|$|R
5|$|The DDL {{project was}} {{reviewed}} {{again when the}} Liberal Fraser Government came into office in late 1975. The review panel unanimously advised the new Minister for Defence James Killen that the DDL project was no longer viable as {{the total cost of}} the ships would be about $130 million higher than the Oliver Hazard Perry project, and it would take three years longer <b>for</b> the <b>DDLs</b> to be completed. Killen accepted this advice, and a firm order for two Oliver Hazard Perry frigates was placed in February 1976. A third ship was ordered in late 1977. Six of these frigates, which were designated the , were eventually ordered, and the final two were built in Australia at Williamstown. The expertise of the DDL project office and the preparations which had been undertaken to manage the process of ordering and building the ships contributed to the Navy's ability to rapidly evaluate alternative designs and oversee their entry into service once an order was placed.|$|R
