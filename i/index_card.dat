5|$|In this episode, Michael's (Steve Carell) {{controversial}} {{imitation of}} a Chris Rock routine forces the staff to undergo a racial diversity seminar. A consultant (Larry Wilmore) arrives to teach the staff about tolerance and diversity, but Michael insists on imparting his own knowledge—aggravating both the consultant and the entire office staff—and creates his own diversity seminar. He eventually assigns each staff member an <b>index</b> <b>card</b> with a different race on it, causing tempers to slowly simmer until they finally snap. Meanwhile, Jim struggles to keep hold of a lucrative contract extension, but Dwight makes the sale for himself.|$|E
25|$|Among {{evidence}} demonstrated toward Heirens's {{guilt is}} the fingerprint {{evidence on the}} Degnan ransom note and on the doorjamb of Frances Brown's bathroom door. However, suspicions on the veracity of doorjamb fingerprints found at the Brown crime scene have arisen, including charges that the police planted the fingerprint since it allegedly looks like a rolled fingerprint, the type that you would find on a police fingerprint <b>index</b> <b>card.</b> Both sets of prints have come under serious question as to their validity, good faith collection and possible contamination; even the possibility of their being planted.|$|E
25|$|Another {{source of}} {{contention}} {{is that the}} Brown crime scene fingerprint has the appearance of having been rolled, which is the practice of taking a person's inked finger and rolling it on an <b>index</b> <b>card,</b> and not the smudged, bloody and unreadable print as originally reported. Traditionally, after the fingertip is covered in ink from either the suspect's hand being pressed {{on top of an}} ink pad or an ink roller being run across it, the finger is placed on the card on one edge. It is rolled once from one edge to the finger's other edge to produce a large, clear print.|$|E

25|$|The British Airports Authority was {{established}} in 1965 by the Airport Authority Act 1965, and on 1 April 1966 the new British Airports Authority Constabulary (BAAC) took on responsibility for operating London Heathrow, London Gatwick and London Stansted airport. The change of administration {{was seen as an}} opportunity to partially reform old working methods, and then-novel innovations were introduced, such as report forms with tick-boxes, an <b>index</b> <b>card</b> system and dictation machines for detectives. In December of that year, the strength of the force stood at 201. In 1969 the Chief Constable, Major W. Ronnie, was awarded the Queen's Police Medal. BAA took on Edinburgh Airport in 1971, and Aberdeen Airport and Glasgow International Airport in 1975. By mid-1970, the strength of the BAAC stood at 326, of which 28 were women.|$|E
25|$|Arthur {{proceeds}} {{to get the}} play verified and published, with Random House shouldering {{the burden of the}} authentication process. When his editor offers to take the play out of his hands, Arthur insists that it's his family's project, and {{he wants to be a}} part of it, and is tasked with writing the play's Introduction. He begins to believe that, without question, The Tragedy of Arthur was written by William Shakespeare, and as he works on the publication of the text, Arthur remains preoccupied with Petra, and ultimately starts sleeping with her despite her relationship with Dana. After his father's death, however, Arthur discovers an <b>index</b> <b>card</b> with details of the play on it, and becomes convinced that it's evidence that the play is a forgery. Furthermore, his father's will dictates that the profit from the publication of the quarto be devised between Arthur, Dana, their mother, and his former business associate, Charles Glassow. The will also requires that the play be published as the work of William Shakespeare, and that any effort made by Arthur to dispute the play's authenticity will result in his share of the profits being retained.|$|E

Milo has had difficulties in school with mathematics and problem solving; his reaction to this encounter is to protest that averages are not real. [...] The partial child enlightens Milo that there is beauty in math beyond the tedium of learning an endless set of rules, [...] "one of the nicest things about mathematics, or anything else you might care to learn, {{is that many of the}} things which can never be, often are". Late in the book, Princess Reason counsels Milo, who has much learning ahead of him, not to be discouraged by its complexity, [...] "You must never feel badly about making mistakes... as long as you take the trouble to learn from them.

500|$|On the October 31, 2007 {{episode of}} the reality show Phenomenon, Paranormalist Jim Callahan {{performed}} a summoning, purportedly of author Raymond Hill, to help discover {{the contents of a}} locked box. [...] Although fellow judge Uri Geller praised the performance, Angel called it [...] "comical" [...] and subsequently challenged both Callahan and Geller to guess the contents of two envelopes he pulled out of his pocket, offering a million dollars of his own money to whoever could do so. This led to an argument between Callahan and Angel, during which Callahan walked toward Angel and called him an [...] "ideological bigot", with the two pulled apart as the show promptly went to a commercial break. Angel has since revealed the contents of one envelope and at the unveiling he challenged Geller one more time. Geller responded, [...] "Although we were born one day apart - I was born on the 20th of December and you on the 19th - a lot of years between us - 40 years, you were one year old when I came out with my spoon bending..." [...] Criss Angel cut him off at this point, saying, [...] "I guess this is a 'no,'" [...] and proceeded to open the envelope. The envelope contained an <b>index</b> <b>card</b> with the numbers [...] "911" [...] printed on it for September 11, 2001. Angel's explanation was this: [...] "If on 9-10 somebody could have predicted that 9-11 was going to happen, they could have saved thousands of lives".

2500|$|While microphotography precedes {{microprint}}, microprint {{was significantly}} influenced by Albert Boni in 1934 {{when he was}} inspired by his friend, writer and editor Manuel Komroff, who was showing his experimentations related to the enlarging of photographs.

[...] Over the following decade, Boni worked to develop microprint, a micro-opaque process in which pages were photographed using 35mm microfilm and printed on cards using offset lithography.
