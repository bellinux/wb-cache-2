6000|$|Recent Physical Changes in the British Isles.--Great Britain {{is perhaps}} the most typical example of a large and recent {{continental}} island now to be found upon the globe.

6000|$|... [122] On Petermann's map of Africa, in Stieler's Hand-Atlas (1879), the Island of Ascension {{is shown}} as {{seated on a}} much larger and {{shallower}} submarine bank than St. Helena. The 1,000 <b>fathom</b> <b>line</b> round Ascension encloses an oval space 170 miles long by 70 wide, and even the 300 <b>fathom</b> <b>line,</b> one over 60 miles long; and it is therefore probable that a much larger island once occupied this site. Now Ascension is nearly equidistant between St. Helena and Liberia, and such an island might have served as an intermediate station through which many of the immigrants to St. Helena passed. As the distances are hardly greater than {{in the case of}} the Azores, this removes whatever difficulty may have been felt of the possibility of any organisms reaching so remote an island. The present island of Ascension is probably only the summit of a huge volcanic mass, and any remnant of the original fauna and flora it might have preserved may have been destroyed by great volcanic eruptions. Mr. Darwin collected some masses of tufa which were found to be mainly organic, containing, besides remains of fresh-water infusoria, the siliceous tissue of plants! In the light of the great extent of the submarine bank on which the island stands, Mr. Darwin's remark, that--"we may feel sure, that at some former epoch, the climate and productions of Ascension were very different from what they are now,"--has received a striking confirmation.

40|$|The {{continental}} shelf {{between the three}} and twelve <b>fathom</b> <b>lines,</b> off the Ceylon coast in the Gulf of Mannar is popularly known as the Pearl Banks. Though the area of this plateau is extensive the pearl oysters are concentrated on restricted areas known as "paars". The more productive of these are the Cheval Group of paars and the Moderagam Paar. The Peria Paar and Twynam's Paar though covering larger areas are not dependable as oyster beds. The True Vankalai, Peria Paar Karai and Muthuvarathu Paars are small in extent, but have yielded oysters on a commercial scale. Although the Ceylon Pearl Banks has been commercially fished for centuries, the first scientific investigation of its pearl oysters on an intensive scale was started by Herdman in 1902 (1902 - 06) and later continued by Hornell (1905 - 41), Shipley (1904 - 06), Pearson (1911 - 33), Jameson (1912 - 13), Southwell (1910 - 14) and Malpas (1922 - 39) ...|$|R
6000|$|We {{have here}} a clear proof that, when these rivers were formed, the land must have stood in {{relation}} to the sea at least 260 feet higher than it does now, and probably much more; and this is sufficient to join England to the continent. Supporting this evidence, we have freshwater or littoral shells found at great depths off our coasts. Mr. Godwin Austen records the dredging up of a freshwater shell (Unio pictorum) off the mouth of the English Channel between the fifty fathom and 100 <b>fathom</b> <b>lines,</b> while in the same locality gravel banks with littoral shells now lie under sixty or seventy fathoms water.[81] More recently Mr. Gwyn Jeffreys has recorded the discovery of eight species of fossil arctic shells off the Shetland Isles in about ninety fathoms water, all being characteristic shallow water species, so that their association at this great depth is a distinct indication of considerable subsidence.[82] ...|$|R
6000|$|The Galapagos {{differ in}} many {{important}} respects from the islands we have examined in our last chapter, {{and the differences}} are such as to have affected the whole character of their animal inhabitants. Like the Azores, they are volcanic, but {{they are much more}} extensive, the islands being both larger and more numerous; while volcanic action has been so recent that a large portion of their surface consists of barren lava-fields. They are considerably less distant from a continent than either the Azores or Bermuda, being about 600 miles from the west coast of South America and a little more than 700 from Veragua, with the small Cocos Islands intervening; and they are situated on the equator instead of being in the north temperate zone. They stand upon a deeply submerged bank, the 1,000 <b>fathom</b> <b>line</b> encircling all the more important islands at a few miles distance, whence {{there appears to be a}} comparatively steep descent all round to the average depth of that portion of the Pacific, between 2,000 and 3,000 fathoms. {276} ...|$|E
60|$|The {{accompanying}} {{map shows}} that Borneo is {{situated on the}} eastern side of a submarine bank of enormous extent, being about 1,200 miles from north to south, and 1,500 from east to west, and embracing Java, Sumatra, and the Malay Peninsula. This vast area is all included within the 100 <b>fathom</b> <b>line,</b> but by far the larger part of it--from the Gulf of Siam to the Java Sea--is under fifty fathoms, or about the same depth as the sea that separates our own island from the continent. The distance from Borneo to the southern extremity of the Malay Peninsula is about 350 miles, and it is nearly as far from Sumatra and Java, while it is more than 600 miles from the Siamese Peninsula, opposite to which its long northern coast extends. There is, I believe, nowhere else upon the globe, an island so far from a continent, yet separated from it by so shallow a sea. Recent changes of sea and land must have occurred here on a grand scale, and this adds to the interest attaching to the study of this large island.|$|E
6000|$|These islands, nine in number, form {{a widely}} {{scattered}} group, situated between 37° and 39° 40' N. Lat. and stretching in a south-east and north-west direction over {{a distance of}} nearly 400 miles. The largest of the islands, San Miguel, is about forty miles long, {{and is one of}} the nearest to Europe, being rather under 900 miles from the coast of Portugal, from which it is separated by an ocean 2,500 fathoms deep. The depth between the islands does not seem to be known, but the 1,000 <b>fathom</b> <b>line</b> encloses the whole group pretty closely, while a depth of about 1,800 fathoms is reached within 300 miles in all directions. These great depths render it in the highest degree improbable that the Azores have ever been united with the European continent; while their being wholly volcanic is equally opposed to the view of their having formed part of an extensive Atlantis including Madeira and the Canaries. The only exception to their volcanic structure is the occurrence in one small island only (Santa Maria) of some marine deposits of Upper Miocene age--a fact which proves some alterations of level, and perhaps a greater extension of this island at some former period, but in no way indicates a former union of the islands, or any greater extension of the whole group. It proves, however, that the group is of considerable antiquity, since it must date back to Miocene times; and this fact may be of importance in considering the origin and peculiar features of the fauna and flora. It thus appears that in all physical features the Azores correspond strictly with our physical definition of [...] "oceanic islands," [...] while their great distance {248} from any other land, and the depth of the ocean around them, make them typical examples of the class. We should therefore expect them to be equally typical in their fauna and flora; and this is the case as regards the most important characteristics, although in some points of detail they present exceptional phenomena.|$|E
60|$|Beyond {{this line}} the sea deepens rapidly to the 500 and 1,000 <b>fathom</b> <b>lines,</b> the {{distance}} between 100 and 1,000 {334} fathoms being from twenty to fifty miles, except {{where there is a}} great outward curve to include the Porcupine Bank 170 miles west of Galway, and to the north-west of Caithness where a narrow ridge less than 500 fathoms below the surface joins the extensive bank under 300 fathoms, on which are situated the Faroe Islands and Iceland, and which stretches across to Greenland. In the North Channel between Ireland and Scotland, and in the Minch between the outer Hebrides and Skye, are a series of hollows in the sea-bottom from 100 to 150 fathoms deep. These correspond exactly to the points between the opposing highlands where the greatest accumulations of ice would necessarily occur during the glacial epoch, and they may well be termed submarine lakes, of exactly the same nature as those which occur in similar positions on land.|$|R

6000|$|When {{the outward}} {{face of the}} reef is examined, you find that the upper edge, which is exposed to the wash of the sea, and all the seaward face, is covered with those living plant-like flowers which I have {{described}} to you. They are the coral polypes which grow, flourish, {{and add to the}} mass of calcareous matter which already forms the reef. But towards {{the lower part of the}} reef, at a depth of about 120 feet, these creatures are less active, and fewer of them at work; and at greater depths than that you find no living coral polype at all; and it may be laid down as a rule, derived from very extensive observation, that these reef-building corals cannot live in a greater depth of water than about 120 to 150 feet. I beg you to recollect that fact, because it is one I shall have to come back to by and by, and to show to what very curious consequences that rule leads. Well then, coming back to the margin of the reef, you find that part of it which lies just within the surf to be coated by a very curious plant, a sort of seaweed, which contains in its substance a very great deal of carbonate of lime, and looks almost like rock; this is what is called the nulli pore. More towards the land, we come to the shallow water upon the inside of the reef, which has a particular name, derived from the Spanish or the Portuguese--it is called a [...] "lagoon," [...] or lake. In this lagoon there is comparatively little living coral; the bottom of it is formed of coral mud. If we pounded this coral in water, it would be converted into calcareous mud, and the waves during storms do for the coral skeletons exactly what we might do for this coral in a mortar; the waves tear off great fragments and crush them with prodigious force, until they are ground into the merest powder, and that powder is washed into the interior of the lagoon, and forms a muddy coating at the bottom. Beside that there are a great many animals that prey upon the coral--fishes, worms, and creatures of that kind, and all these, by their digestive processes, reduce the coral to the same state, and contribute a very important element to this fine mud. The living coral found in the lagoon, is not the reef building coral; it does not give rise to the same massive skeletons. As you go in a boat over these shallow pools, you see these beautiful things, coloured red, blue, green, and all colours, building their houses; but these are mere tenements, and not to be compared in magnitude and importance to the masses which are built by the reef-builders themselves. Now such a structure as this is what is termed a [...] "fringing reef." [...] You meet with fringing reefs of this kind not only in the Mauritius, but in a number of other parts of the world. If these were the only reefs to be seen anywhere, the problem of the formation of coral reefs would never have been a difficult one. Nothing can be easier than to understand how there must have been a time when the coral polypes came and settled on the shores of this island, everywhere within the 20 to 25 <b>fathom</b> <b>line,</b> and how, having perched there, they gradually grew until they built up the reef.|$|E
