5|$|The British monarch is Sovereign of the Order of St Patrick. The Lord Lieutenant of Ireland, the monarch's {{representative}} in Ireland, {{served as the}} Grand Master. The office of Lord Lieutenant was abolished in 1922; the last Lord Lieutenant and Grand Master was The 1st Viscount FitzAlan of Derwent. Rather oddly, the statutes of the Order did not provide that the Grand Master be admitted to the Order {{as a matter of}} right. While some Lords Lieutenant were in fact appointed to the Order, this seems to have been the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
25|$|These {{two studies}} {{indicate}} that confidentiality can be somewhat of an illusion; once an emotional experience is socially shared, confidentiality may actually be the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
25|$|After the Great Schism, {{there existed}} a Catholic Bishopric of Cumania (later, {{separate}} bishoprics in both Wallachia and Moldavia). However, {{this seems to}} be the <b>exception,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> as in both Wallachia and Moldavia the state religion was Eastern Orthodox. Until the 17th century, the official language of the liturgy was Old Church Slavonic. Then, it gradually changed to Romanian.|$|E
50|$|Some state crowns might however be {{used during}} {{parts of the}} {{coronation}} ceremony. In isolated cases, individual monarchs sometimes chose to use their state crown instead of the official coronation crown for the crowning, but those cases were <b>exceptions</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm.|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the barriers to}} closer cooperation between progressive economists and progressive social change movements. The author provides some examples of successful cooperation, but suggests that these are <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. The article makes five concrete suggestions for each side that would help to strengthen the relationships between them, and engage progressive economists more fully in social change campaigns. JEL classification: B 5...|$|R
50|$|Although an <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm, some SaaS {{solutions}} {{do not use}} multitenancy, or {{use other}} mechanisms—such as virtualization—to cost-effectively manage {{a large number of}} customers in place of multitenancy. Whether multitenancy is a necessary component for software-as-a-service is a topic of controversy.|$|R
25|$|Osborne {{did change}} the world of theatre, {{influencing}} playwrights such as Edward Albee and Mike Leigh. However, work of his kind of authenticity and originality would remain the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> This did not surprise Osborne; nobody understood the tackiness of the theatre better than {{the man who had}} played Hamlet on Hayling Island. He was awarded a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Writer's Guild of Great Britain.|$|E
25|$|Her work {{makes clear}} that for medieval readers the act of reading itself had an oral phase in which the text was read aloud or sub-vocalized (silent reading was a less common variant, and {{appears to have been}} the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule),</b> then meditated upon and 'digested' hence making it one's own. She asserts that both 'textual' {{activities}} (picturing and reading) have as their goal the internalization of knowledge and experience in memory.|$|E
25|$|In the {{passenger}} airline case, capacity {{is regarded as}} fixed because changing what aircraft flies a certain service based on the demand is the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> When the aircraft departs, the unsold seats cannot generate any revenue and thus {{can be said to}} have perished, or have spoiled. Airlines use specialized software to monitor how seats are reserved and react accordingly. There are various inventory controls such as a nested inventory system. For example, airlines can offer discounts on low-demand flights, where the flight will likely not sell out. When there is excess demand, the seats can be sold at a higher price.|$|E
40|$|E. coli {{could be}} <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm {{regarding}} bacterial DNA replication, as other bacteria have two Pol III replicases or a second Pol III for induced mutagenesis.

Saint John Shipbuilding Ltd., 1997 3 SCR 1210, McLachlin {{clarified}} the result, {{affirming that}} recovery for contractual relational economic loss is <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. There is a presumption against contractual relational economic loss, subject to recognized exceptional categories: ...|$|R
50|$|While {{slaves were}} {{sometimes}} employed for manual labour during the Arab slave trade, this was usually <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. The {{vast majority of}} labour in the medieval Islamic world consisted of free, paid labour. The only known exceptions to this general rule was in the plantation economy of 9th-century southern Iraq (which led to the Zanj Revolt), in 9th-century Ifriqiya (modern-day Tunisia), and in 11th-century Bahrain (during the Karmatian state).|$|R
25|$|All {{three of}} the {{northern}} New England states (Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine) contain some areas that are unincorporated and unorganized, not part of any town, city or plantation. Maine has significantly more such area {{than the other two}} states. While these areas do exist, their importance should not be overstated. They are certainly the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in the New England system, and the number of New England residents who live in them is extremely small in comparison to those who live in towns and cities, even in Maine. Most such areas are located in very sparsely populated regions. Much of the barely inhabited interior of Maine is unorganized, for example.|$|E
25|$|This can be {{the case}} when {{multiple}} genes act in parallel {{to achieve the same}} effect. For example, when an organism is in need of phosphorus, multiple enzymes that break down different phosphorylated components from the environment may act additively {{to increase the amount of}} phosphorus available to the organism. However, there inevitably comes a point where phosphorus is no longer the limiting factor for growth and reproduction and so further improvements in phosphorus metabolism have smaller or no effect (negative epistasis). Some sets of mutations within genes have also been specifically found to be additive. It is now considered that strict additivity is the <b>exception,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> since most genes interact with hundreds or thousands of other genes.|$|E
25|$|Preparing for {{sea-level rise}} can be {{justified}} in many cases, because the cost of preparing now is small compared {{to the cost of}} reacting later. Examples include wetland protection, flood insurance, long-lived infrastructure, and coastal land-use planning. Nevertheless, preparing for sea-level rise has been the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most coastal institutions were based on the implicit assumption that sea level and shorelines are stable. Efforts to plan for sea-level rise can be thwarted by several institutional biases, including government policies that encourage coastal development, flood insurance maps that do not consider sea-level rise, federal policies that prefer shoreline armoring over soft shore protection, and lack of plans delineating which areas would be protected or not as sea level rises.|$|E
50|$|Besides {{religious}} laws {{such as the}} Torah, important codifications {{were developed}} in the ancient Roman Empire, with the compilations of the Lex Duodecim Tabularum and much later the Corpus Iuris Civilis. These codified laws were <b>the</b> <b>exceptions</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rule, however, as during much of ancient times Roman laws were left mostly uncodified.|$|R
50|$|The paper did {{not recover}} from the usual summer {{advertising}} slump. As a consequence, {{the vast majority of}} issues of the Fall 2005 semester were six pages, with eight-page issues being <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm (compared to the fall 2004 semester, when most issues were eight to 10 pages, and sometimes even 12).|$|R
25|$|Sydney's largest ancestry {{groups are}} English, Australian, Irish, Chinese and Scottish. Foreign {{countries}} of birth {{with the greatest}} representation are England, China, India, New Zealand and Vietnam. The concentration of immigrants in Sydney, relative {{to the rest of}} Australia (excluding Melbourne), make it <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm on having such a high foreign born population.|$|R
500|$|For {{the chamber}} repertoire, Ketèlbey {{composed}} a string quartet (c.1896) and a quintet for piano and wind (1896) {{which won the}} Costa Prize and the College Gold Medal. His 1894 Romance for violin and piano was praised as [...] "a charming, musicianly work". His other early works include choral pieces, including the anthems [...] "Every good Gift"; [...] "Behold upon the mountains", and [...] "Be strong, all ye people" [...] (all 1896). After these works he moved professionally into conducting light opera, and serious music became the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule</b> in his compositions.|$|E
500|$|Ships {{designed}} for coastal warfare, like the floating batteries of the Crimea, or [...] and her sisters, dispensed with masts from the beginning. The British , started in 1869, {{was the first}} large, ocean-going ironclad to dispense with masts. Her principal role was for combat in the English Channel and other European waters; while her coal supplies gave her enough range to cross the Atlantic, {{she would have had}} little endurance {{on the other side of}} the ocean. The Devastation and the similar ships commissioned by the British and Russian navies in the 1870s were the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Most ironclads of the 1870s retained masts, and only the Italian navy, which during that decade was focused on short-range operations in the Adriatic, built consistently mastless ironclads.|$|E
500|$|The {{band has}} made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their {{use during the}} band's early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his [...] "infatuation with ripping off metal licks" [...] stemmed from his {{experiments}} with E-mu's Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, [...] "What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play {{it over and over}} again." [...] While the album Don't Blow Your Top was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as [...] "a battalion of guitars marching through Europe." ...|$|E
50|$|Salt shakers {{began to}} appear in the Victorian era, and patents show {{attempts}} {{to deal with the problem}} of salt clumping, but they remained <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. It was not until after 1911, when anti-caking agents began to be added to table salt, that salt shakers gained favor and open salts began to fall into disuse.|$|R
50|$|Sydney's largest ancestry {{groups are}} English, Australian, Irish, Chinese and Scottish. Foreign {{countries}} of birth {{with the greatest}} representation are England, China, India, New Zealand and Vietnam.

40|$|Congress {{has long}} been unpopular with the American public, with {{approval}} numbers above fifty percent serving as <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. In this essay we argue that such disapproval stems not from calculated reaction to policy outcomes or partisan attachments. Rather, people tend to disapprove of Congress for exactly the thing {{it was designed to}} be: an open and deliberative lawmaking body. The more Congress does its job, the more the public tends to disapprove...|$|R
500|$|The group's albums {{have tended}} to be both lyrically and musically darker in {{atmosphere}} than many of their progressive rock peers (a trait they shared with King Crimson, whose guitarist Robert Fripp guested on two of their albums), and guitar solos were the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> preferring to use Banton's classically influenced organ, and, until his departure, Jackson's multiple saxophones. While Hammill is the primary songwriter for the band, and its members have contributed to his solo albums, he is keen to stress that the band collectively arranges all its material. Hammill's lyrics frequently covered themes of mortality, due to his love of science fiction writers such as Robert Heinlein and Philip K. Dick, along with his self-confessed warped and obsessive nature. His voice has been a distinctive component of the band throughout its career. It has been described as [...] "a male Nico" [...] and would later on be cited as an influence by Goth bands in the 1980s. Though the group have generally been commercially unsuccessful outside of early 1970s Italy, they have inspired several musicians, including John Lydon and Julian Cope.|$|E
2500|$|Our {{account of}} the {{function}} of Judgment in our mental life will, however, have to start a long way back. For there is much thinking before there is any judging, and much living before there is any thinking. Even in highly developed minds judging is a relatively rare incident in thinking, and thinking in living, an <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> and a relatively recent acquisition.|$|E
2500|$|Nevertheless, such {{censorship}} was the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> As long as {{one took}} care to be discreet, and did not cross the boundaries of [...] "blasphemy" [...] as Adriaan Koerbagh was accused of having done in 1669, the authorities were prepared to {{turn a blind eye}} to this kind of radical publications (though freedom of the press did not exist de jure). The [...] "True Freedom" [...] as a political concept was [...] accompanied by intellectual freedom in practice, and this practical freedom engendered the formulation of philosophical justifications thereof, that would resound in the later Enlightenment.|$|E
5000|$|Anecdotes {{like this}} do not prove anything. In any case where some factor affects the {{probability}} of an outcome, <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> uniquely determining it, selected individual cases prove nothing; e.g. [...] "my grandfather smoked 40 a day until he died at 90" [...] and [...] "my sister never went near anyone who smoked but died of lung cancer". Anecdotes often refer to <b>the</b> <b>exception,</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> rule: [...] "Anecdotes are useless precisely because they may point to idiosyncratic responses." ...|$|R
5000|$|Another {{factor was}} the Zanj Rebellion against the {{plantation}} economy of ninth-century southern Iraq. Due to {{fears of a}} similar uprising among slave gangs occurring elsewhere, Muslims {{came to realize that}} large concentrations of slaves were not a suitable organization of labour and that slaves were best employed in smaller concentrations. As such, large-scale employment of slaves for manual labour became <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm, and the medieval Islamic world did not need to import vast numbers of slaves.|$|R
50|$|There {{are often}} wide {{variations}} in how workers are actually treated {{depending on the}} local franchise owner. Some employees start out in entry-level McJobs and later become assistant managers or managers, continuing {{to work at the}} same franchise for many years; however this is <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm. McDonald's advertises that its CEO, Jim Skinner, began working at the company as a regular restaurant employee, and that 20 of its top 50 managers began work as regular crew members.|$|R
2500|$|Alternatively Vernon Robbins (1978) {{regards the}} [...] "we" [...] {{passages}} as a Greek rhetorical device used for sea voyages. However, more recent scholars have since {{written on the}} incoherence of Robbins' sea voyages literary device theory by arguing that contemporary first-person accounts were the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule,</b> that Robbins' cited literature is too broad in both linguistic range (Egyptian, Greek, and Latin) and its temporal extent (1800 BC to third century AD), many of the literary sea voyages cited represented the author's actual presence and were not literary devices at all, many of his examples use the third-person throughout and not just during sea voyages, etc.|$|E
2500|$|Although {{originally}} a personal name, the cognomen frequently became hereditary, especially in large families, or gentes, {{in which they}} served to identify distinct branches, known as stirpes. [...] Some Romans {{had more than one}} cognomen, and in aristocratic families it was not unheard of for individuals to have as many as three, of which some might be hereditary and some personal. [...] These surnames were initially characteristic of patrician families, but over time cognomina were also acquired by the plebeians. [...] However, a number of distinguished plebeian gentes, such as the Antonii and the Marii, were never divided into different branches, and in these families cognomina were the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{concept of}} an O is clearly defined in the United States and Canada (and to some extent, several other {{countries}} such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Brazil, [...] Argentina, Chile and Japan), where network-owned stations had historically been the <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> <b>rule.</b> In such places, broadcasting licenses are generally issued on a local (rather than national) basis, and there is (or was) some sort of regulatory mechanism in place to prevent any company (including a broadcasting network) from owning stations in every market in the country. In {{other parts of the}} world, many television networks were given national broadcasting licenses at launch; as such, they have traditionally been mostly (or entirely) composed of O, rendering a separate notion for such a concept redundant.|$|E
30|$|While {{previously}} proposed {{conditions for}} a bilingual advantage were not supported by our investigation, {{it is possible that}} our study may have missed a factor that is required for a bilingual advantage. We concur that a bilingual advantage may be generated under very specific conditions, but the very large number of suggested conditions and requirements shows that any effect is <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm and may be a statistical artifact. Nevertheless, learning a language has intrinsic benefits regardless of whether cognitive benefits exist.|$|R
30|$|Importantly, this {{acknowledgement}} {{also allowed}} policymakers {{to rethink their}} national disability scheme’s goals and bring them {{more in line with}} modern notions of disability. This meant discarding terminology and criteria of incapacity and replacing them with a focus on ability. More than just semantic window dressing the new terminology changed people with impairments expectations from dependence on disability benefits based on not working to work. Of course, for some individuals work was not possible, but this increasingly became <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> norm.|$|R
30|$|For many years, SR {{has been}} {{considered}} something bound to become the rule {{in the very near}} future [2, 10]. Using focus group methodology, we have tried to determine why SR—despite a clear preference among radiologists and referring clinicians for this type of reporting—is <b>the</b> <b>exception</b> <b>rather</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> standard in nearly all radiology departments. This focus group meeting has provided us with a number of possible explanations, as well as with suggestions for resolving the paradox and with topics for further quantitative study.|$|R
