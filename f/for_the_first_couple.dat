By 1957, Phillips was recording more and more groups of young men with guitars, basses, washboards and drums, who played skiffle.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Morrissey {{was greatly}} {{interested}} in film, television and Gene Kelly musicals. After seeing a broadcast of Kes on television, {{he decided to}} become an actor. At his primary school, St Margaret Mary's School, he was encouraged by a teacher named Miss Keller, who cast him as the Scarecrow in a school production adapted from The Wonderful Wizard of Oz when he was 11 years old. Keller left the school soon after, leaving Morrissey without encouragement. His secondary school, De La Salle School, had no drama classes and {{was the sort of}} place where Morrissey thought the fear of bullying dissuaded pupils from participating in lessons. On the advice of a cousin, Morrissey joined the Everyman Youth Theatre. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of weeks, he was quite shy and did not join in the workshops. When he eventually participated, he appeared in the youth theatre's production of Fighting Chance, a play about the riots in Liverpool. He went to the theatre on Tuesday and Wednesday nights.|$|E
5|$|Well {{established}} in the imperial capital, Honório Hermeto campaigned in 1829 to become a general deputy (member of the Chamber of Deputies, the national lower house) as a representative for his native Minas Gerais. He was elected to {{a seat in the}} legislature for the term beginning April 1830. He {{became a member of the}} Liberal Party, which stood in opposition to PedroI and his policies. As a general deputy, Honório Hermeto had an unobtrusive role <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of years, having been overshadowed by Bernardo Pereira de Vasconcelos, the leader of the deputies representing Minas Gerais. Short, slim and with a speech impediment, the dark-haired Honório Hermeto appeared an unimpressive figure at first glance. Like his father, he was headstrong, opinionated and often scathing. However, he had self-confidence and a powerful charisma, and was energetic, intelligent, perspicacious and a natural born leader.|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} cystic {{fibrosis}} (CF) -causing mutation in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is deletion of Phe 508 (ΔF 508) in <b>the</b> <b>first</b> of two nucleotide-binding domains (NBDs). Nucleotide binding and hydrolysis at the NBDs and phosphorylation {{of the regulatory}} (R) region are required for gating of CFTR chloride channel activity. We report NMR studies of wild-type and ΔF 508 murine CFTR NBD 1 with the C-terminal regulatory extension (RE), which contains residues of the R region. Interactions of the wild-type NBD 1 core with the phosphoregulatory regions, the regulatory insertion (RI) and RE, are disrupted upon phosphorylation, exposing a potential binding site <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>coupling</b> helix of <b>the</b> N-terminal intracellular domain (ICD). Phosphorylation of ΔF 508 NBD 1 does not as effectively disrupt interactions with the phosphoregulatory regions, which, along with other structural differences, leads to decreased binding of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>coupling</b> helix.

25|$|The Tri-State {{supercell}} {{is thought}} to have formed around noon about 40 minutes prior to the first tornado reports in Shannon County. It was a classic supercell <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> hours of its life, gradually transitioning into a high precipitation (HP) supercell in southern Illinois. The very long track tornado period lasted from around 12:40 pm to 4:40 pm. The supercell then likely produced another significant tornado in southeastern Indiana around 6 pm. Convection had gradually increased in the warm sector throughout the supercell's life cycle. It may have become embedded within a line echo wave pattern (LEWP) by the time it reached south-central Indiana. The supercell is assumed to have decayed around 7 pm. These estimated times indicate the supercell's duration as around 7 hours over a calculated ≈ path.|$|E
25|$|Whether {{and exactly}} when the statue was commissioned, {{acquired}} or donated is unknown, and documents {{referring to the}} Madonna are scarce <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of centuries of its existence. It seems certain that {{it was part of}} the cathedral treasure by 993, when Emperor Otto III paid the abbey a visit and donated a crown, the so-called “child’s crown”, which is also part of the treasure to this day. Since this first mention the Madonna has always been in the cathedral save in wartime. Apparently the bitter conflict between the diocese of Cologne and the Lords of Isenberg over control of Essen Abbey that resulted in the murder of Archbishop Engelbert at the hands of Friedrich von Isenberg in 1225 did not affect the sculpture, nor did the centuries-long quarrel over whether the city of Essen was legally a free imperial city or rather a dependency of the abbey.|$|E
25|$|Malaysian filming {{has gone}} through five stages. The first stage {{occurred}} when narrative filmmaking began in 1933, with the production of Laila Majnun by a company operating out of Singapore. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>couple</b> of decades following World War II, most films were directed by directors from India and the Philippines, which produced a second stage of movies. The first locally directed film, Permata di-Perlembahan, was produced in 1952. It however failed in the cinemas. A third stage appeared as Singapore-based studios began to produce films in the 1950s, but the industry was subsequently damaged due to independence of Singapore {{and the loss of}} studios there. Indonesian films gained popularity at this time, although a small group of filmmakers continued to produce in Malaysia, forming the fourth stage. In the 1980s the local industry began to recover, bringing about the fifth and most eloquent stage, which covered more themes than any previous stage. This was also the first time non-Malay films began to have a significant presence.|$|E

Only SMS Seydlitz and Moltke could immediately comply: SMS Derfflinger had too many holes to travel at speed, and SMS Von der Tann needed to clean ash from her boilers forcing her to steam slowly. When Derfflinger and Von der Tann drew abreast of the flagship SMS Friedrich der Grosse, Scheer once again ordered them to the rear. The two joined the end of the German column, but Seydlitz and Moltke remained out of position initially ahead of the fleet and had to move independently through the British fleet.

40|$|The Larsen group {{specializes in}} maximizing the {{potential}} of simple organic substrates through single-step, multicomponent reactions to yield complex compounds with potential therapeutic and synthetic applications. Combining a carbonyl, an amine, and a terminal alkyne {{under a variety of}} novel conditions provides a range of propargylamines. 	Attempts towards the incorporation of labile protecting groups on propargylamines led to the discovery of <b>the</b> <b>first</b> catalytic three-component method able to incorporate electron-poor amines, specifically p-toluenesulfonamide. Mechanistic studies showed copper(II) triflate to be unique in its ability to catalyze both the condensation of p-toluenesulfonamide onto an aldehyde and sequential coupling with a terminal alkyne. This method also provided a rare example of a three-component coupling between cyclohexanone, benzylamine, and 1 -octyne. Investigations into the synthesis of this cyclohexanone-derived propargylamine led to an efficient copper(II) chloride catalyzed reaction yielding fully-substituted centers on cyclohexane rings. Equimolar amounts of starting reagents, low-catalyst loading, and water as the sole by-product of this reaction leant to its efficacy. Inclusion of Lewis acidic titanium tetraethoxide provided a Cu/Ti catalyzed method of novel scope, allowing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>coupling</b> of acyclic ketones with amines and alkynes to give fully-substituted amine-bearing carbon centers in a single step. 	An alternate route to these densely-functionalized substrates was discovered to be a unique tandem hydroamination/alkynylation reaction. Markovnikov addition of an amine across a terminal alkyne yields enamine which, upon tautamerization to ketimine, is coupled with a second equivalent of the same alkyne to form propargylamine...|$|R
40|$|Background: Marginal {{changes in}} the {{execution}} of competitive sports movements can represent a significant change for performance success. However, such differences may emerge only at certain execution intensities and are not easily detectable through conventional biomechanical techniques. This study aimed to investigate if and how competition standard and progression speed affect race walking kinematics from both a conventional and a coordination variability perspective. Methods: Fifteen experienced athletes divided into three groups (elite, international, and national) were studied while race walking on a treadmill at two different speeds (12. 0 and 15. 5 [*]km/h). Basic gait parameters, the angular displacement of the pelvis and lower limbs, and the variability in continuous relative phase between six different joint couplings were analyzed. Results: Most of the spatio-temporal, kinematic, and coordination variability measures proved sensitive to the change in speed. Conversely, non-linear dynamics measures highlighted differences between athletes of different competition standard when conventional analytical tools {{were not able to}} discriminate between different skill levels. Continuous relative phase variability was higher for national level athletes than international and elite in two couplings (pelvis obliquity—hip flex/extension and pelvis rotation—ankle dorsi/plantarflexion) and gait phases (early stance <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> <b>coupling,</b> propulsive phase <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second) that are deemed fundamental for correct technique and performance. Conclusion: Measures of coordination variability showed to be a more sensitive tool <b>for</b> <b>the</b> fine detection of skill-dependent factors in competitive race walking, and showed good potential for being integrated in the assessment and monitoring of sports motor abilities...|$|R
