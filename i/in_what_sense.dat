25|$|The {{attempt to}} render the laws of reason or thought impersonal by professing to find them {{in the sphere of}} {{spontaneous}} apperception, and above reflective necessity, is unsuccessful. Cause, substance, time, space, are given us as realized in a particular form. In no single act of affirmation of cause or substance, much less in such a primitive act, do we affirm the universality of their application. There may be particular instances or cases of these laws, but we could never get the laws themselves in their universality, far less absolute impersonality. No amount of individual instances of the application of any of them by us would give it a true universality. The only sure test we have of their universality in our experience is the test of their reflective necessity. We thus after all fall back on reflection as our ground for their universal application; mere spontaneity of apprehension is futile; their universality is grounded in their necessity, not their necessity in their universality. How far and <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>sense</b> this ground of necessity renders them personal are of course questions still to be solved.|$|E

At appeal the lower court's decision was upheld but the fine was reduced to €6,500, reportedly due to Williamson's financial circumstances.

2500|$|The early 20th century Oxford {{professor}} Samuel Rolles Driver {{taught that}} [...] sets out the fundamental truth of Israel's religion, the uniqueness and unity of God, and the fundamental duty founded upon it of the devotion to God of the Israelite's entire being. Reading [...] Driver asked <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>sense</b> the word [...] "One" [...] {{is to be}} understood: Does it express the Unity of God, declaring that God is in God's essence indivisible, and cannot — like Ba'al and Ashtoret, for instance, who are often spoken of in the plural — assume different phases or attributes, as presiding over different localities, or different departments of nature, and cannot further be united syncretistically with other deities; but is only known under the one character by which God has revealed God’s Self to Israel? Or does the word [...] "One" [...] denote the Uniqueness of God, representing God in a unique sense, as the God with whom no other god can be compared, as the only Deity to whom the true attributes of the Godhead really belong? Driver taught that the second interpretation gives the higher and fuller meaning to the term, and forms also a more adequate basis for the practical duty inculcated in [...] for a God, who was not unique might not necessarily be a worthy object of human love. Driver taught that the first interpretation, however, is not excluded by the second, for the unity of God is almost a necessary corollary of God's Uniqueness. Driver concluded that [...] is thus a great declaration of Monotheism in the sense both {{that there is only}} one God, and also that the God who exists is truly One. Driver taught that the truth is one which in its full significance was only gradually brought home to the Israelites and was hardly explicitly enunciated much before the age of Deuteronomy and Jeremiah. Driver read verses like [...] ( [...] in the KJV), and [...] to imply that God is superior to [...] "other gods" [...] or that [...] "other gods" [...] cannot be compared to God, but not to deny the real existence of [...] "other gods."

40|$|This paper proposes partial {{answers to}} the {{following}} questions: <b>in</b> <b>what</b> <b>senses</b> can fitness differences plausibly be considered causes of evolution? What relationships are there between fitness concepts used in empirical research, modeling, and abstract theoretical proposals? How does the relevance of different fitness concepts depend on research questions and methodological constraints? The paper develops a novel taxonomy of fitness concepts, beginning with type fitness (a property of a genotype or phenotype), token fitness (a property of a particular individual), and purely mathematical fitness. Type fitness includes statistical type fitness, which can be measured from population data, and parametric type fitness, which is an underlying property estimated by statistical type fitnesses. Token fitness includes measurable token fitness, which can be measured on an individual, and tendential token fitness, which {{is assumed to be}} an underlying property of the individual in its environmental circumstances. Some of the paper’s conclusions can be outlined as follows: claims that fitness differences do not cause evolution are reasonable when fitness is treated as statistical type fitness, measurable token fitness, or purely mathematical fitness.

Deliberating citizens seek relevant information, reflect on the issues, and exchange views with others. The most valuable kind of deliberation is balanced, taking account of information both convenient and inconvenient to given arguments and alternatives, although much naturally occurring deliberation is of course highly imbalanced. People tend to acquire information disproportionately consistent with what they already have, think mainly along customary lines, and talk mostly with others who think as they do.
