50|$|An {{external}} {{video monitor}} (or modified television receiver) could {{be connected to}} the IBM 5100 via a BNC connector on the back panel. While the 5100 had a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch</b> to select between white on black or black on white for the internal display, this switch did not affect the external monitor, which only offered bright characters on a black background. The vertical scan rate was fixed at 60 Hz.|$|E
50|$|The {{story as}} written by Nather {{involved}} Kaye's work on rewriting a blackjack program from the LGP-30 to a newer Royal McBee system, the RPC-4000; company sales executives had requested {{to modify the}} program {{so that they could}} flip a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch</b> and cause the program to lose (and the user to win). Kaye reluctantly acceded to the request, but to his own delight, he got the test wrong, and the switch would instead cause the program to win every time (and the user to lose).|$|E
40|$|The Life Sciences Laboratory Equipment Echocardiograph, a {{commercial}} 77020 AC Ultrasound Imaging System modified to meet NASA's spacecraft standards, is described. The assembly {{consists of four}} models: display and control, scanner, scan converter, and physioamplifiers. Four separate processors communicate over an IEE- 488 bus, and the system has more than 6000 individual components on 35 printed circuit cards. Three levels of self test are provided: a short test during power up, a basic test initiated by a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch,</b> and interactive tests for specific routines. Default mode operation further enhances reliability. Modifications of the original system include the replacement of ac power supplies with dc to dc converters, a slide-out keyboard (to prevent accidental operation), Teflon insulated wire, and additional shielding for the ultrasound transducer cable...|$|E

40|$|A {{mechanical}} occlusive cuff controller {{suitable for}} blood flow experiments in space shuttle flights is described. The device requires 115 volt ac {{power and a}} pressurized gas source. Two occluding cuff pressures (30 and 50 mmHg) are selectable by a switch on the front panel. A screw driver adjustment allows accurate cuff pressurization levels for under or oversized limbs. Two pressurization cycles (20 second and 2 minutes) can be selected by a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch.</b> Adjustment of the timing cycles is also available through the front panel. A pushbutton hand switch allows remote start of the cuff inflation cycle. A stop/reset switch permits early termination of the cycle and disabling of the controller to prevent inadvertent reactivation. Pressure in the cuff is monitored by a differential aneroid barometer. In addition, an electrocardiogram trigger circuit permits the initiation of the pressurization cycle by an externally supplied ECG cycle...|$|E
40|$|The OEM- 1 {{electronic}} module is discussed; it {{is comprised of}} four subsystems: the signal processing and display; the stepper motor controls; the chopper controls; and the dc-dc invertor. The OEM- 1 module controls the sample wheel so that the relative transmittance of the samples {{can be compared to}} the clear aperture position. The 3 - 1 / 2 digit digital voltmeter displays the clear aperture signal level as well as the ratio of the remaining sample positions relative to the clear aperture position. The sample wheel position is decoded so that the signals and ratios can be correlated to the data. The OEM is automatically reset to the I sub o on initial turn-on and can be reset to the ' 0 ' position by actuating a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch.</b> The sample wheel can be interrupted to change samples or induce a longer integration time if desired by a front panel command. Integration times from 1 - 50 seconds are provided at the front panel, and BCD data for external interfacing is provided...|$|E
40|$|Spellman’s CZE 1000 R {{is a full}} feature rack {{mountable}} {{high voltage power supply}} ideal for laboratory usage. It’s designed {{to meet the needs of}} applications requiring a hot switched reversible output voltage. The output polarity can be quickly and safely reversed via a <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switch.</b> Both the output voltage and current are fully adjustable from 0 to 30 kV and 0 to 300 uA via front panel ten turn locking counting dials. Remote control operation is done by 0 to + 10 Vdc programming signals; either user generated or using the provided + 10 Vdc reference and external potentiometers. Front panel voltage and current meters provide local monitoring. Voltage and current test points are provided such that 0 to 10 Vdc corresponds to 0 to 100 % rated output. A two position, normally closed, external interlock is provided for protection of external high voltage accessible areas. If the interlock is opened the high voltage will shut off and fall to zero in less than one second and not be able to be re-energized until the interlock is closed. Excellent load and line regulation specifications along with outstanding stability and low ripple of the CZE 1000 R assure a stable high voltage output for consistent process results...|$|E

50|$|Between mid-1960 and June 1961, {{the basic}} {{hardware}} was assembled, initially at Digital’s facility in Maynard, and later at Itek. Itek's PDP-1 {{was the second}} one to be delivered to a customer, the first being to MIT's Project MAC. A new 25 inch tube was used, larger than the PDP-1's standard 16 inch Type 30, but packaged in a similar hexagonal case. Input was via a combination of light pen for pointing, and the PDP-1's <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> for commands.

50|$|In {{the early}} days of computers, there were no disk drives, floppy disks or modern flash storage devices. Early storage devices such as delay lines, punched cards, paper tape, {{magnetic}} tape, and magnetic drums were used instead. And in {{the early days}} of microcomputers and home computers, paper tape or audio cassette tape (see Kansas City standard) or nothing were used instead. In the latter case, program and data entry was done at <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> directly into memory or through a computer terminal / keyboard, sometimes controlled by a read-only memory (ROM) BASIC interpreter; when power was turned off after running the program, the information so entered vanished.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{design and}} constructional features of CPLD based control and interlocking units {{for a typical}} MST radar transmitter. The conventional digital hardware used for controlling the radar transmitter and performing the interlock operations {{has been replaced by}} Xilinx’s XC 9572 C 10 PC 84 CPLD device. The latest state of the art devices replace the <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> and LEDs display. This has resulted in miniaturizing the entire control and interlock subsystems. The necessary code is written in Verilog HDL. The newly designed system overcomes the design flaws in the earlier system hardware.

40|$|Motion control {{solutions}} for controlling {{a movement of}} motorized mechanical subsystems for accelerators, telescopes or similar spatially distributed systems require high degree of flexibility regarding the use and connectivity. One platform should fit different applications and provide cost effective solutions. A connection to the control system (CS) is required on one side, while {{on the other side}} a connection to a variety of motors, position encoders and other feedback devices must be provided. In case of more complex mechanics, an advanced kinematics control is essential to provide features such as motion tuning, interpolation and controlled acceleration. An embedded computer is used for SW-flexibility and CS-support. Motion control capabilities are provided by separate HW; programmable multi axis controller. Signal adaptation for a direct connection of the equipment is managed by an interface board. Easy installation and debugging is provided by low-level local control; <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> and indicators, RS 232 or direct keyboard and monitor access.

40|$|The {{test setup}} {{consists}} of four major elements: the programmable power supplies and load banks, the data acquisition and control system control computer, and the NiH 2 specimen test cells. A simplified block diagram of the test setup is shown. The test setup provides complete battery isolation should a fault occur, and fusing as necessary to protect the battery cells and other equipment. <b>Front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> provide for power supply configuration and battery isolation. <b>Front</b> <b>panel</b> meters provide continuous real-time visual monitoring of the voltage and current for each pack of cells. A strip chart recorder provides a hard copy of the voltage and current profiles {{for each of the}} packs. The test operates continuously with minimal human interface, except during special tests. The two power supplies are controlled by resistance programming. A bank of resistors and relays was built which can be switched by the control computer to provide control over the charge current to the batteries. The load banks are controlled by the 3497 A. The 3497 A is equipped with a 0. 5 volt programmable power supply which is used to voltage program the load banks. A Hewlett-Packard Vectra 9000 running an HP Basic program is used as the control computer to remotely instruct the 3497 A (data acquisition and control) to scan the data channels and retrieve test data. The program then reads, calculates, and stores the data. If an anomaly occurs, the program will disconnect the cells and shut down the test to avoid damage to the cells or equipment...|$|R
40|$|The Systems Integration, Test, and Evaluation (SITE) {{facility}} at NASA Lewis Research Center is presently configured as a satellite-switched time {{division multiple access}} (SS-TDMA) network simulator. The purpose of SITE is to demonstrate and evaluate advanced communication satellite technologies, presently embodied by POC components developed under NASA contracts {{in addition to other}} hardware, such as ground terminals, designed and built in-house at NASA Lewis. Each ground terminal in a satellite communications system will experience a different aspect of the satellite's motion due mainly to daily tidal effects and station keeping, hence a different duration and rate of variation in the range delay. As a result of this and other effects such as local oscillator instability, each ground terminal must constantly adjust its transmit burst timing so that data bursts from separate ground terminals arrive at the satellite in their assigned time slots, preventing overlap and keeping the system in synchronism. On the receiving end, ground terminals must synchronize their local clocks using reference transmissions received through the satellite link. A feature of the SITE facility is its capability to simulate the varying propagation delays and associated Doppler frequency shifts that the ground terminals in the network have to cope with. Delay is ahcieved by means of two NASA Lewis designed and built range delay simulator (RDS) systems, each independently controlled locally with <b>front</b> <b>panel</b> <b>switches</b> or remotely by an experiment control and monitor (EC/M) computer...|$|R
