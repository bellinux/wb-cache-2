5|$|City at the End of Time is a 2008 {{science fiction}} novel by American writer Greg Bear. It was {{published}} in August 2008 by Del Rey in the United States, and Gollancz in the United Kingdom. The story follows three drifters in present-day Seattle who are tormented by strange dreams of the Kalpa, a city one hundred trillion years in the future.

5|$|If {{one game}} is played as a sequel to the other by a linked password, Twinrova captures Princess Zelda, {{lighting}} the Flame of Despair. Link enters a warp point by the Maku Tree and faces Twinrova, who <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to use the three Flames to revive Ganon, the primary antagonist in the Zelda series. Link defeats both Twinrova and a mindless, poorly resurrected Ganon. He frees Zelda, whose sacrifice {{would have been the}} full resurrection of Ganon; together, they exit the crumbling castle. After the credits, Link is seen waving to a crowd from a sailboat off the shore of a land with a castle in the background.|$|E

5|$|In 1966 Donen {{made another}} Hitchcock-inspired film: Arabesque, {{starring}} Gregory Peck and Sophia Loren. The film {{was written by}} Julian Mitchell and Stanley Price, with an uncredited rewrite by Peter Stone. Peck plays an American professor at Oxford University who {{is an expert in}} ancient hieroglyphics. He is approached by a Middle Eastern prime minister to investigate an organization that <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to assassinate him and uses hieroglyphic codes to communicate. The investigation leads Peck to one mystery after another, often involving the prime minister's mysterious mistress (Loren). The film was Donen's second consecutive hit.|$|E
5|$|In 2006, a new registry, the Foundation Foxtrotter Heritage Association (FFHA), {{was formed}} {{with a goal}} of {{preserving}} and promoting the original heritage type of Fox Trotter that {{was seen in the}} first 20 years of the MFTHBA registry, in large part through reducing the amount of Tennessee Walking Horse blood. The Tennessee Walker did not figure prominently in original Missouri Fox Trotter pedigrees, and so the FFHA, by restricting the amount of Walker blood, <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to develop horses that more closely resemble the original Fox Trotter type.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by Gorée's example, Carabane <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to {{pay homage}} to victims of slavery by {{starting}} a small museum like the House of Slaves. Like Gorée and Saint-Louis, Carabane places great importance on its cultural heritage. The architectural reminders of this heritage require significant restoration as they have experienced considerable degradation. In 1964, French anthropologist Louis-Vincent Thomas posed the question of whether Carabane should be preserved, and this question continues to be relevant. The local people suggest that the entire Diogue–Nikine–Carabane area needs saving.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Kecal <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to buy Jeník off, {{and after}} some verbal fencing makes a {{straight}} cash offer: a hundred florins if Jeník will renounce Mařenka. Not enough, is the reply. When Kecal increases the offer to 300florins, Jeník pretends to accept, but imposes a condition – {{no one but}} Mícha's son {{will be allowed to}} wed Mařenka. Kecal agrees, and rushes off to prepare the contract. Alone, Jeník ponders the deal he has apparently made to barter his beloved ("When you discover whom you've bought"), wondering how anyone could believe that he would really do this, and finally expressing his love for Mařenka.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, her husband, Frank Hallsworth (Ben Gazzara), <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> {{to break}} off {{an affair with a}} young South Korean woman (Karen Kahn). Her father (Toshiro Mifune) is aware of his daughter's affair with Hallsworth and does not disapprove. Hallsworth {{receives}} word of the invasion by the North Koreans, and he travels north in an attempt to locate his wife with the assistance of army sergeant August Henderson (Richard Roundtree). Henderson encounters Hallsworth's wife and fixes her vehicle's battery, and then reunites her with her husband.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk is framed.|$|E

50|$|IA-BF - The Impairment Aware Best Fit (IA-BF) {{algorithm}} {{was proposed}} in. This algorithm is a distributed approach that is dependent upon {{a large amount of}} communication to use global information to always pick the shortest available path and wavelength. This is accomplished through the use of serial multi-probing. The shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted</b> first, and upon failure, the second shortest available path and wavelength <b>are</b> <b>attempted.</b> This process continues until a successful path and wavelength have been found or all wavelengths have <b>been</b> <b>attempted.</b>|$|R
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to {{play a significant role in}} treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the first part takes place in flashbacks while a team of ill-equipped soldiers and scientists arrive at the Destiny. Eli Wallace (David Blue) solves a mathematical equation in an online computer game, planted there by Stargate Command. For his achievement, Dr. Nicholas Rush (Robert Carlyle) and General Jack O'Neill (Richard Dean Anderson) recruit Wallace to the Icarus program, which <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to dial a nine-chevron address with the Stargate. Wallace's solution {{is the key to}} controlling the power levels for the Gate. He is taken aboard the Hammond, an Earth Daedalus-class starship, to be taken to the planet where Icarus is set up. During the journey, he meets Chloe Armstrong (Elyse Levesque), daughter of Senator Alan Armstrong (Christopher McDonald).|$|E
5|$|The plot of Century Falls {{is driven}} by a legend that no {{children}} {{had been born in}} the eponymous village for more than forty years.

She quickly befriends the psychic Ben Naismith (Simon Fenton) and his twin sister Carey (Emma Jane Lavin). The three teenagers examine the waterfall that gave Ben his powers and the disaster that caused the legendary infertility. The serial climaxes in a confrontation between Tess and the deity Century, who <b>is</b> <b>attempting</b> to fuse with Tess's unborn sister.|$|E
50|$|Integrated Windows Authentication {{itself is}} not a {{standard}} or an authentication protocol. When IWA is selected as an option of a program (e.g. within the Directory Security tab of the IIS site properties dialog) this implies that underlying security mechanisms {{should be used in}} a preferential order. If the Kerberos provider is functional and a Kerberos ticket can be obtained for the target, and any associated settings permit Kerberos authentication to occur (e.g. Intranet sites settings in Internet Explorer), the Kerberos 5 protocol will <b>be</b> <b>attempted.</b> Otherwise NTLMSSP authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> Similarly, if Kerberos authentication <b>is</b> <b>attempted,</b> yet it fails, then NTLMSSP <b>is</b> <b>attempted.</b> IWA uses SPNEGO to allow initiators and acceptors to negotiate either Kerberos or NTLMSSP. Third party utilities have extended the Integrated Windows Authentication paradigm to UNIX, Linux and Mac systems.|$|R
