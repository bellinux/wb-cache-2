5|$|After {{learning}} of Crix Madine's (a former Imperial Commander Human, who had defected to the Alliance) capture and imminent execution, Kyle proceeds {{to a high}} security detention center on Orinackra to rescue him. Madine provides the Rebel Alliance with information about the smuggling of Dark Trooper materials, leading Katarn to investigate the Ramsees Hed docking port on Cal-Seti. He then destroys a robotics facility on the icy planet Anteevy, {{the second stage of}} the Dark Trooper production line. After being captured by Jabba the Hutt and having to escape his ship, Katarn infiltrates a computer vault on Coruscant which reveals the location of the Ergo <b>fuel</b> <b>station,</b> the final stage in the smuggling route. He masquerades as a smuggler, gaining access to the Super Star Destroyer Executor, which brings him finally to the Arc Hammer starship, the headquarters of General Mohc's Dark Trooper project, where he successfully destroys the operation and kills Mohc.|$|E

By May 2016, there were approximately 80 hydrogen <b>fueling</b> <b>stations</b> in Japan.

25|$|Eidsberg Station {{grew up as}} a {{community}} hub and featured at various times a store, post office, telegraph, café, bakery and <b>fuel</b> <b>station.</b> However, there never grew up a village around station like many other of the stations in the area. The post office opened in 1885, {{and a year later}} a warehouse for Felleskjøpet was erected next to the station. A road was built from the station to Huseby in 1910. Eidsberg and Mysen were split into two municipalities in 1920. Unlike around Mysen Station, Eidsberg Station had never developed into a town. Some people called for the new municipal hall to be built next to the station so a new village could be built around them. This was not done and instead it was placed at Søndre Mysen. Despite efforts, only nine lots were sold around Eidsberg Station the following one and a half decade.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, Ekebergbanen bought four Berliet buses with {{bodies from}} Skabo Jernbanevognfabrikk {{and put them}} into service on two lines, from Jernbanetorget to Abildsø and from Sæter to Godheim. The latter route was used to feed the Ekeberg Line. In 1927, the company bought Republic and Studebaker buses, and in 1928 four Büssing buses which {{replaced}} the Berliet vehicles. From 1927 to 1931, the company ran a bus line from Jernbanetorget to Simensbråten, and also for some years from Nordstrandshøgda to Aker University Hospital. From 28 August 1932, the two original bus lines were combined and extended to Sværsvann. It was branded as Østmarkaruten and ran the route Jernbanetorget–Abildsø–Klemetsrud–Godheim–Sværsvann. In 1937, the company bought four diesel buses from Büssing. In 1940, the company had four modern diesel buses and three older gasoline buses. The company had silver buses with a wine red cheatline with the EB logo in silver on a blue background. The company also ran an automotive workshop and <b>fuel</b> <b>station</b> at Holtet.|$|E
25|$|LaGuardia Depot {{is located}} on a two-block long {{structure}} (85-01 24th Avenue) bound by 85th and 87th Street, and 23rd and 24th Avenues in the East Elmhurst & Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens, New York near LaGuardia Airport. The depot was opened on January 15, 1954, is owned by GTJ Reit Inc, and was operated by Triboro Coach Corporation before being leased to the City of New York and operated by MTA Bus Company on February 20, 2006 {{for a period of}} 21 years. In 1989, a methanol <b>fuel</b> <b>station</b> was installed at the facility for six General Motors-built RTS methanol buses. It was later used in the early 1990s to fuel an NYCT demonstration bus from the Casey Stengel Depot and three new Triboro-operated RTS buses fitted with special Detroit Diesel Series 92 engines. Beginning in 1994, the facility dispatched compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in addition to its diesel fleet. The depot was decommissioned from CNG operations in 2006 due to not meeting the MTA's safety and environmental standards. On April 10, 2006, while workers from KeySpan were removing CNG from tanks and a private contractor was conducting construction near the depot, a gas compressor station exploded leading to a large fire at the depot. One bus was destroyed and 12 were damaged. Also, work to modify this depot to accommodate articulated-buses is almost completed.|$|E

2500|$|Despite EPA's waiver, {{there is}} a {{practical}} barrier to the commercialization of the higher blend {{due to the lack}} of infrastructure, similar to the limitations suffered by sales of E85, as most <b>fuel</b> <b>stations</b> do not have enough pumps to offer the new blend, few existing pumps are certified to dispense E15, and there are no dedicated tanks readily available to store E15. [...] In July 2012 a <b>fueling</b> <b>station</b> in Lawrence, Kansas became the first in the U.S. to sell the E15 blend. The fuel is sold through a blender pump that allows customers to choose between E10, E15, E30 or E85, with the latter blends sold only to flexible-fuel vehicles. This station was followed by a Marathon <b>fueling</b> <b>station</b> in East Lansing, Michigan. , there are about 24 <b>fueling</b> <b>stations</b> selling E15 out of 180,000 stations operating across the U.S.|$|R

The Svalbard Council changed its regulations from 1993 and allowed parties to run for election. In a step to increase tourism, Svalbard Polar Hotel opened in 1995, and a year later mining of Mine 3 terminated. Longyearbyen Community Council was established in 2002, replacing the Svalbard Council and assimilating SSD, and took on many of the responsibilities and the structure of a municipality.|$|E

40|$|Fuels, when {{improperly}} stored or misused, {{may cause}} grave environmental and physical risks {{and as the}} <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> present characteristics of potentially polluting enterprises and environmental accidents generators, this work presents a diagnosis of {{the situation of the}} <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> of Belém, Pará State, by sample, related to the system of installation and storage of petroleum derivatives and other fuels, their main failing which cause impacts over the environment due to leakage, safety devices, equipment that avoid and/or restrain the main impacts like superficial and subterranean waters contamination, soil contamination and other risks: fire or explosion in accordance with the legislation and Brazilian specific rules.   The objective is to determine the main failures of the system of storage at <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> and the main impacts caused to environment due to leakage. The work was developed by using data collection and in loco observation of fifteen <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> in the Metropolitan Region of Belém, by choosing five <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> from each class, according to the NBR 13786, excluding the class 0. All the <b>fuels</b> <b>stations</b> which were observed were nonstandard, excepting one of the III class and other of the class 1.

500|$|A major {{restriction}} hampering {{sales of}} E85 flex vehicles, or fueling with E85, is the limited infrastructure available to sell E85 {{to the public}} with only 2% of the motor fuel stations offering E85 by March 2014. , there were only 3,218 fueling stations selling E85 {{to the public in}} the entire U.S., while about 156,000 retail motor fuel outlets do not offer any ethanol blend. In addition, there has been a great concentration of E85 stations in the Corn Belt states. The main constraint for a more rapid expansion of E85 availability is that it requires dedicated storage tanks at filling stations, at an estimated cost of [...] for each dedicated ethanol tank. The Obama Administration set the goal of installing 10,000 blender pumps nationwide until 2015, and to support this target the US Department of Agriculture (USDA) issued a rule in May 2011 to include flexible fuel pumps in the Rural Energy for America Program (REAP). This ruling will provide financial assistance to <b>fuel</b> <b>station</b> owners to install E85 and blender pumps.|$|E

It {{calls for the}} establishment of small sanctuaries, leaving large groups of survivors abandoned in special zones in order to distract the undead and allowing those within the main safe zone time to regroup and recuperate. Governments worldwide assume similar plans or relocate the populace to safer foreign territory, such as the complete evacuation of the Japanese archipelago to Kamchatka, which is deemed a success. Because zombies freeze solid in severe cold, many civilians in North America flee to the wildernesses of northern Canada and the Arctic, where eleven million people die of starvation and hypothermia. It is implied that some turn to cannibalism to survive; further interviews from other sources imply that cannibalism occurred in areas of the United States where food shortages occurred.
