5000|$|One of {{the more}} {{difficult}} decisions in selecting a sound level meter is [...] "How {{do you know if}} it complies with its claimed standard?" [...] This is a difficult question and IEC 61672 part 2 tries to answer this by the concept of [...] "pattern approval". A manufacturer has to supply instruments to a national laboratory which tests one of them and if it meets its claims issue a formal <b>Pattern</b> <b>Approval</b> certificate. In Europe, the most common approval is often considered to be that from the PTB in Germany (Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt). If a manufacturer cannot show at least one model in his range that has such approval, it is reasonable to be wary, but the cost of this approval militates against any manufacturer having all his range approved. Inexpensive sound level meters (under $200) are unlikely to have a <b>Pattern</b> <b>Approval</b> and may produce incorrect measurement results.|$|R

40|$|Objective: to {{estimate}} bispectral (BIS) index and electroencephalographic (EEG) changes during anesthesia with halothane, sevoflurane, and a successive combination of sevoflurane and isoflurane, by {{taking into account}} age. Subjects and methods. Sixty children aged 3 to 17 years, who had undergone elective surgery, were randomized to 3 groups of 20 children each: 1) halothane anesthesia; 2) sevoflurane anesthesia; and 3) a successive combination of sevoflurane and isoflurane. A 1 : 1 oxygen-nitrous oxide mixture was used for anesthesia in all the groups. EEG (using a 6 -channel computer-assisted encephalograph) and bispectral index (XP version) was continuously recorded throughout the anesthesia, except the transition to isoflurane in Group 3. Results. In the halothane group, EEG displayed a gradual reduction in basic rhythm, an increase in slow activity with the rhythm being recovered on emergence. The BIS index changed from 96 — 99 to 19 — 36 with a spike of up to 80 — 87 on emergence. In Groups 2 and 3 where the induction of anesthesia used sevoflurane, EEG recorded a pointed а-rhythm, increased amplitude, and rhythm synchronization. The BIS value changed from 96 — 99 to 19 — 37. In Group 2, it was 30 to 40 on anesthesia maintenance and up to 82 — 87 on emergence. In Group 3, the isofluorane anesthesia stage changed <b>EEC</b> <b>patterns</b> towards rhythm synchronization and gave rise to slow fluctuations in all leads. The BIS index was 30 — 39 on anesthesia maintenance and 80 — 86 on emergence. Conclusion. EEC and BIS index monitoring values corresponded to the clinical course and depth of anesthesia. The comparison of the clinical data of the course of anesthesia and the values of EEG and BIS monitoring {{could lead to the}} conclusion that BIS technology might be of informative value in children.

40|$|Above-The-Road (AbTR) radar is a {{new type}} of speed {{measurement}} device used in China for traffic speed enforcement. The antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions are critical parameters for AbTR radar because speed measurement accuracy partly depends on vertical beamwidth and speed measurement interference from adjacent lanes can be effectively minimized by appropriate choice of horizontal beamwidth. In this paper, the speed measurement principle of AbTR radar is introduced and the reason for field speed measurement error is presented. The speed measurement error is theoretically calculated in various combinations of different vertical beamwidths and possible installation angles. The requirement for horizontal beamwidth to operate with less interference from adjacent lanes is also theoretically laid down with different installation heights and angles. Field tests with three equal-distanced piezosensors each lane as triggering references have been performed on an AbTR radar sample with vertical beamwidth 5. 1 ° and horizontal beamwidth 5. 2 °. The results of theoretical analysis and field tests validate that the requirement of less than 6 ° for AbTR radar antenna beamwidths in vertical and horizontal directions is a precondition for accurate and reliable field measurements, which has been added to the China’s <b>pattern</b> <b>approval</b> regulation for AbTR radar devices newly published...|$|R

In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} {{collection}} of high level workflow activity patterns based on the semantic of specific business functions (e. g., notification, task execution request, approval).

He regarded Western achievements and advanced technology in natural sciences as a tool, without actually interrogating the principles behind natural sciences. In other words, he merely attached importance to the technology of practicability. As the brains behind Tokugawa Nariaki, a Japanese daimyo who ruled the Mito domain, Aizawa Seishisai had the ruler 2 ̆ 7 s ear on topics such as the introduction of military technology, prohibition against Western study and Christianity. His notion of western study and attitude towards western culture had an influence on Tokugawa Nariaki. Above all, his thought about Western culture were reflected in the reformation of the Mito domain, and he had an influence on the bakufu through the propositions that Tokugawa Nariaki would put forward. This pattern of Aizawa Seishisai’ s pragmatic acceptance of western culture, had an influence on the concept of wakonyosai, “Japanese spirit combined with Western learning” and the treatment of Western culture in the process of bunmei-kaika, “Japan 2 ̆ 7 s civilization and Westernization” from the Meiji period on, which is the period in which we will pay attention to the differences between kyūri, “study of natural laws and social ethics” in Confucianism and the principle of western natural sciences...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{reviews the}} results of two decades of {{research}} on moral approval of aggressive acts conducted in several countries with different religious and cultural backgrounds. A nationally-adapted version of the Lagerspetz and Westman questionnaire was administered to university students in Finland, Poland, Spain, Japan, Iran and India. Respondents had to indicate levels of justification of several aggressive acts of different quality and intensity {{in the context of}} different social justifications. Although slight method variations preclude the possibility of direct comparison, the pattern of effects in the different countries leads to interesting conclusions. In all countries: more drastic forms of aggression (e. g., killing, torture) are less accepted than non-dangerous forms of such behavior (e. g., hindering, being ironic); and aggressive acts that are socially justified (in terms of protection of self or other) are clearly more accepted than ones with no such justification (problems of communication). However, there are also some striking differences among the samples studied. Thus, <b>patterns</b> of moral <b>approval</b> of various kinds of aggressive acts are only to some extent common to most cultures, while there are some culturally bound differences in these attitudes. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to provide a {{predictive}} account for a nearly 60 percent decrease in the number of Catholic seminaries extant in 1968. Standards for seminary operations published by the Catholic Bishops in 1968 and 1971 were hypothesized to have no predictive relationship with seminary survival. The population consisted of all qualified Catholic seminaries in the United States. Cell group arrangements, obtained from the intersection of seminary survival with seminary academic levels, served as criterion composites with a variety of seminary measures serving as predictor composites in four differentiated multiple discriminant analyses. Survival alone served as criterion with regression analysis. The annual CARA Seminary Directory served as database. Values for more than seventy measures were obtained for use with univariate hypotheses tests from the CARA Seminary Directory. The level of probability set for rejection of the null hypotheses was. 05. Findings 1. Student body size, number of doctors on faculty, number of bachelors on faculty, and diocesan Catholic population were among the successful stepwise predictors of seminary survival. 2. Size of faculty, size of administration, total number of priests, articulation <b>pattern,</b> state <b>approval,</b> and number of professional memberships were among the unsuccessful stepwise predictors of seminary survival. 3. Generally, hypothesized variables were unsuccessful blockwise predictors of survival. 4. Seventeen significant discrimant functions were found in the four discriminant analyses; eight functions reduced to two successful predictors of seminary survival by seminary level for initial and terminal data sets: (1) faculty qualification, and (2) commitment to run a school. Conclusions 1. Multivariate predictors of seminary survival based on 1968 data differed from predictors based on terminal data for the most part. 2. Individual norms and standards proposed by the Catholic Bishops had an unanticipated joint effect upon seminary survival. 3. For the most part, closure or amalgamation of seminaries could not be predicted by failure to fulfill particular norms or standards proposed by the Catholic Bishops. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
40|$|Objective. To {{describe}} treatment {{patterns and}} factors influencing treatment in a real-world setting of US patients with metastatic melanoma (MM). Methods. This was a retrospective claims-based study among patients with MM diagnosed between 2005 and 2010 identified from MarketScan databases. Results. Of 2546 MM patients, 66. 8 % received surgery, 44. 7 % received radiation, 38. 7 % received systemic therapies, and 17. 7 % received all modalities. Patients with lung, brain, liver, or bone metastases {{were less likely}} to undergo surgery (all P< 0. 0001); patients with lung (P= 0. 04), brain (P< 0. 001), or liver metastases (P= 0. 03) were more likely to receive systemic therapies; patients with brain (P< 0. 0001) or bone metastases (P< 0. 0001) were more likely to receive radiation therapy. Oncologists were more likely to recommend systemic therapy (P< 0. 0001) or radiation (P< 0. 0001), while dermatologists were more likely to recommend surgery (P= 0. 002). Monotherapy was the dominant systemic therapy (82. 4 % patients as first-line). Conclusions. Only 39 % of MM patients received systemic therapies, perhaps reflecting efficacy and safety limitations of conventional systemic therapies for MM. Among those receiving systemic therapy, monotherapy was the most common approach. Sites of metastases and physician speciality influenced treatment patterns.

A nationally-adapted version of the Lagerspetz and Westman questionnaire [1] was administered to 332 university students of both sexes in Spain and Hong Kong. Respondents had to indicate levels of justification of several aggressive acts of different quality and intensity in the context of different social justifications. Our results replicated the general findings of previous research in other cultures: in both samples, more drastic forms of aggression (e. g., killing, torture) were less accepted than non-dangerous forms of such behavior (e. g., hindering, being ironic); aggressive acts more socially justified (in terms of protection of self or other) were clearly more accepted than others with no such justification (problems of communication); and instrumental-motivated aggression was higher justified than emotional-motivated aggression. Some differences in the level of acceptance according to the sex of the participants were found: women were more prone to a higher acceptance of acts and situations more related to emotion. Although both sexes justified aggression in a higher degree for instrumentally motivated situations than for emotional ones, males showed a higher acceptance than females for instrumental situations and a lower one than females for emotional ones. There were also some minor culturally bound differences in these attitudes: Spaniards accepted less than HK students aggression in emotional situations, specially for the cases of punishment and lack of communication, but more emotional acts, such as rage and shouting.
