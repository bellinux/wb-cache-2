40|$|As {{digital library}} {{development}} begins {{to focus on}} interoperability and collection federation, resource developers {{need to be concerned}} with contributing to national and international collections, while not losing sight of the needs of institutions and user communities. The Digital Collections and Content (DCC) project aims to provide integrated access to IMLS National Leadership Grant (NLG) digital collections through a centralized collection registry and metadata repository. While technical development proceeds on the repository, our research team is investigating how collections and items can best be represented {{to meet the needs of}} both service providers and diverse user communities. This paper presents results on metadata and collection representation practices based on survey data, interviews, and content analysis. Despite <b>Dublin</b> <b>Core's</b> prevalence and ease of use, problems with field richness and consistency of application persist, in part because of the distinct cultures of description that have evolved in different kinds of cultural heritage institutions. Moreover, the concept of a digital collection is widely unsettled among resource developers. This has important implications for central repositories, if, as we hypothesize, the strategic foregrounding and backgrounding of collection-level metadata proves critical for navigation and interpretation of information in large-scale federated collections...|$|R
2500|$|Therefore, {{producers}} and consumers of RDF statements must {{agree on the}} semantics of resource identifiers.

2500|$|Both {{versions}} of the statements above are wordy because one requirement for an RDF resource (as a subject or a predicate) is that it be unique.

If the software recognizes [...] http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/title (a specific definition for the concept of a title established by the <b>Dublin</b> <b>Core</b> Metadata Initiative), it will also know that this title is different from a land title or an honorary title or just the letters t-i-t-l-e put together.|$|E

40|$|Introduction The aim of {{this work}} is to analyse the {{technical}} development performed in SCIENTIA, digital repository of the Ministry of Health. SCIENTIA project arises from {{the will of the}} Ministry of Health to provide open, free and permanent access to scientific knowledge generated by the different entities of the Catalan Public Health Administration, with the aim of increasing the visibility, impact and recognition of the research that is being conducted. Material and methods The operating characteristics of SCIENTIA have been defined: a) Context: community and audience, content typology, general conditions for the acceptance of documents and intellectual property; b) User policy: roles and access levels; c) Flows and processes: documental channel and preservation policies; d) Software technical characteristics and requirements, functionalities of content and collection management system, technical administration and services for users. To make the repository interoperable and to exchange data with other data collection and exploitation system of scientific output, metadata schemes based on the reference Open Archival Information System (OAIS), <b>Dublin</b> <b>Core’s</b> metadata standards, DRIVER guidelines, Creative Common licenses and a permanent URL were applied. Results With {{the development and implementation of}} SCIENTIA, we have obtained a tool that allows: to create and share knowledge, collect and preserve scientific output, increase the public value of participating institutions, and to maximize the visibility and the impact of scientific output. Conclusions The digital revolution has changed the way of disseminating scientific information. Access to scientific output is basic for research, innovation and scientific heritage preservation. To have a tool that promotes an open, free and permanent access and enables scientific knowledge to be disseminated, shared and preserved over time is basic. ...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we present}} an {{approach}} to improve information retrieval in digital scientific theses. This approach consists in defining and using ?metadata? to help the users to find relevant information during search sessions. This research is {{one part of the}} CITHER project (Consultation en Texte Integral des THEses En Reseau) developed by the INSA of Lyon (France). CITHER concerns the online publishing of the INSA?s scientific theses. In a first step, CITHER has permitted the distribution of the theses in PDF format (Portable Document Format), via a server of documents. However, this system does not permit to select only the pertinent parts of the theses during a search session. It is necessary to read the entire document to find them. In {{the first part of this}} paper, we present the initial structure of a thesis stored in the CITHER?s server. Then, we describe our method to define a new structure of document based on ?semantic metadata?. We propose to introduce the concept of ontology to define the semantic ?metadata? and to use XML (eXtended Markup Language) to structure the document. To define the semantic ?metadata?, we extract the main concepts such as ?model?, ?theorem?, ?method?, ?tool?, etc. found in almost all the theses. We formalize these concepts according to an ontology. Therefore, the new model of document includes ?classical metadata? (<b>Dublin</b> <b>Core?s,</b> etc) and ?semantic metadata?, which are both included in the document by the way of XML tags. This model of document is based on a logical and semantic structure. The information retrieval, in our new format of theses, takes place by the use of XML tags. In the second part of this paper, we will present our prototype and some examples to illustrate our proposition and the results. We will finish this paper with our conclusion and the future propositions to improve the prototype...|$|R

Far greater craft, combination and cohesion in attack, together with a back line that made only one mistake in the full fifty minutes, despite long spells of Antrim pressure, gave Dublin the title after a scintillating game. At al times but more especially so in the second half, Antrim had as much if not more of the play than the victors but whereas the <b>Dublin</b> forwards <b>cored</b> from almost every possible opportunity, the Ulster champions blazed wide time and again when well placed. Una O’Connor, who won her tenth All Ireland medal, roamed well outfield from her normal full-forward post, and, too mobile for opposing full-back Moya Forde, distributed the bal magnificently to a brilliant pair of corner-forwards Judy Doyle and Bríd Keenan, whose well taken scores made all the difference.|$|R

TASC as an entity is the public work that forms {{the basis of the}} context statement. The themes explored concern the specific challenges involved in establishing an independent, progressive think tank in Ireland. To provide context, a short chronological account of the ten years from 2001 - 2010 is provided. This is followed by a discussion of how and why TASC is not only the first independent think tank in the Republic of Ireland, but acted as a catalyst for the emergence of a think tank field there. The issue of legitimacy is key to the evolution of both TASC and the space for think tanks so in Section 3, dimensions of this issue are examined. Many argue that because think tanks are founded and run by self-selected, small groups of individuals that at best they represent only these people and at worst serve the vested interests which fund them, while others argue that think tanks are an essential component of a pluralist society. Some of these arguments are explored in Section 4, which describes how TASC’s unique structure and functioning impacted on the author, the wider group involved in TASC and TASC staff. In Section 5, the role of funding is discussed, identifying the importance of charitable foundations to TASC’s establishment and survival in the first crucial ten years. Section 6 offers the authors concluding reflections...|$|R

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} looked at the absence and need for orbital public {{transport}} corridors in the Greater Dublin Area [1]. This current paper outlines recent evidence which demonstrates that demand for such orbital services exists. Recent travel survey data indicates that demand exists in Dublin for both orbital and “networked” trips. In surveys of public transport users on two public transport corridors in the Greater Dublin Area, 27 % of people transferred either from or to another public transport service as part of their journey. Overall this appears a very significant level of passenger transfer within an urban transport market where traditionally transferability is thought of as being low or negligible. This suggests that there is an existing demand for orbital and directional trips (those which involve a transfer) within the Greater Dublin Area. Both surveys were taken across contrasting areas of the city. The evidence for transfer demand is corroborated by the census and by household travel data collected by the NTA, both of which indicate a clear and significant demand for orbital trips. No matching or supporting high level of service corridors currently exist to support these. The <b>Dublin</b> City Council <b>Core</b> Strategy also suggests the implementation of an orbital network and this should, in a normal planning framework, lead transport strategy. Orbital High Quality Bus Corridors have been proposed for Dublin in the past but never implemented. Orbital routes are often considered a costly idea that is unpopular with transport users. Yet many cities provide them in a successful, often revenue-generating context. Cities that support successful orbital services take a Network Effect approach to service design where high quality transferability is paramount. Local and international evidence suggests that orbital QBCs can be a success if implemented {{with a high level of}} service. The benefits of implementing orbital high quality corridors goes beyond serving immediate trip demand and can help to create an effective city-wide transport network...|$|R
