5|$|Governments {{around the}} world are {{considering}} a range of waste management and disposal options, usually involving deep-geologic placement, although there has been limited progress toward implementing long-term waste management solutions. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because the timeframes in question when dealing with radioactive waste range from 10,000 to millions of years, according to studies based on the effect of estimated radiation doses.|$|E

5|$|In December 2007, {{as part of}} Gripen International's {{marketing}} efforts in Denmark, a deal was signed with Danish technology supplier Terma A/S that lets them participate in an industrial cooperation programme over the next 10–15 years. The total value of the programme is estimated at over DKK10billion, and <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> dependent on a procurement of the Gripen by Denmark.|$|E
5|$|Kahn {{was born}} in Karlsruhe. He <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> of Latvian descent; his father Rolf {{was born in}} Liepāja, where he remains well-known, to a Latvian mother and a Baltic German father. Rolf briefly played professionally for Karlsruher SC, as did his son Axel, Oliver Kahn's older brother.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium has no {{biological}} function, although fungi {{can use it}} {{in place}} of sulfur and selenium in amino acids such as tellurocysteine and telluromethionine. In humans, tellurium <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> metabolized into dimethyl telluride, (CH3)2Te, a gas with a garlic-like odor exhaled in the breath of victims of tellurium exposure or poisoning.|$|E

5|$|The {{consumption}} of parsnips has potential health benefits. They contain antioxidants such as falcarinol, falcarindiol, panaxydiol, and methyl-falcarindiol, which may potentially have anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antifungal properties. The dietary fiber in parsnips <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> of the soluble and partly the insoluble type and comprises cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The high fiber content of parsnips {{may help prevent}} constipation and reduce blood cholesterol levels.|$|E
5|$|The metal is {{divalent}} {{and has a}} noticeably high volatility. In {{order to}} reduce the self-radiation damage, most measurements of solid einsteinium and its compounds are performed right after thermal annealing. Also, some compounds are studied under the atmosphere of the reductant gas, for example H2O+HCl for EsOCl so that the sample <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> regrown during its decomposition.|$|E
5|$|The most {{commonly}} used method of suicide varies between countries, and <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> related to the availability of effective means. Common methods include hanging, pesticide poisoning, and firearms. Among transgender persons rates of attempted suicide are between 30 and 50%.|$|E

5|$|The {{sex ratio}} in 2011 was 838 females per 1,000 {{males in the}} island city, 857 in the suburbs, and 848 as a whole in Greater Mumbai, all numbers lower than the {{national}} average of 914 females per 1,000 males. The low sex ratio <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> because of the large number of male migrants who come to the city to work.|$|E
5|$|The species <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> self-compatible, as some seed is set when pollinators are excluded. Selection against self-pollinated seed {{has been}} observed, but the species has {{nonetheless}} {{been shown to}} have one of the lowest outcrossing rates of any Banksia. This is probably caused by the small population sizes, which increase the probability of self-fertilisation, and may discourage visits by pollinators.|$|E
5|$|A related {{issue is}} the {{inclusion}} of pregnant women in clinical studies. Since other illnesses can exist concurrently with pregnancy, information is needed on the response to and efficacy of interventions during pregnancy, but ethical issues relative to the fetus, make this more complex. This gender bias <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> offset by the iniation of large scale epidemiology studies of women, such as the Nurses' Health Study (1976), Women's Health Initiative and Black Women's Health Study.|$|E

5|$|A {{relatively}} {{small proportion of}} total membership comes from Canada. A growing portion of the Canadian demographic {{is made up of}} immigrant members of the church. This <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> the result of Canadian demographics as a whole, and partly due to decreased interest amongst late generation Canadians. The largest concentration of active congregations in Canada are in Southern Ontario, with notable congregations gathering in Beamsville, Bramalea, Niagara Falls, Vineland, Toronto (several), and Waterloo. Although many congregations of various sizes (typically under 300 members) meet all across Canada.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{made little}} impact on its first publication, the 1906 novel Love Among the Chickens {{contained}} what French calls the author's first original comic creation: Stanley Featherstonehaugh Ukridge. The character, an amoral, bungling opportunist, <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> based on Wodehouse's Globe colleague Herbert Westbrook. The two collaborated between 1907 and 1913 on two books, two music hall sketches, and a play, Brother Alfred. Wodehouse {{would return to the}} character in short stories over the next six decades.|$|E
5|$|Although the Rogue Valley near Medford <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> urban, {{the average}} {{population}} {{density of the}} Rogue watershed is only about 32 people per square mile (12 per km2). Several historic bridges cross the river near the more populated areas. Many public parks, hiking trails, and campgrounds are near the river, which flows largely through forests, including national forests. Biodiversity {{in many parts of}} the basin is high; the Klamath-Siskiyou temperate coniferous forests, which extend into the southwestern Rogue basin, are among the four most diverse of this kind in the world.|$|E

5|$|Another bust of {{particular}} value is the marble portrait of Armand Gaston, sculpted in 1730–1731 in Rome by Edmé Bouchardon. It is also {{displayed in the}} library. The floor of the chapel <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> covered with a 1745 imitation of a Turkish carpet, woven in the Aubusson manufactory and bearing in its centre the coat of arms of Armand Gaston deRohan. The carpet covering the large table {{in the middle of}} the library was woven in Portuguese India around 1730. It was given to the Cathedral chapter after 1806 and sold to the Musée de Cluny in 1865 but was returned to the city of Strasbourg on permanent loan in 1939.|$|E
5|$|BSkyB's {{continued}} {{partnership with}} the Premier League {{has led to an}} increase in the value of broadcasting rights and matches televised. Managers however have voiced their concerns about the latter and the excessive cost of live rights <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> a reason why top-flight football has not returned to the BBC or ITV. In 2005 BSkyB's monopoly on live rights ended after the European Commission ruled that the Premier League needed to have more than one holder.|$|E
5|$|Chase {{had been}} fascinated by {{organized}} crime and the mafia from an early age, witnessing such people growing up. He also was raised on classic gangster films, such as The Public Enemy, and the crime series The Untouchables. The series <b>is</b> <b>partly</b> inspired by the Boiardo family, a prominent New Jersey organized crime family when Chase was growing up, and partly on New Jersey's DeCavalcante family. He has mentioned American playwrights Arthur Miller and Tennessee Williams as influences on the show's writing, and Italian director Federico Fellini as an important influence on the show's cinematic style.|$|E
