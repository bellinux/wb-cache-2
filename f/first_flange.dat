40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Giardia lamblia is {{recognized}} as one of the most common protozoan causes of diarrheal diseases worldwide. Giardia is an extracellular parasite that colonizes the intestine using its cytoskeleton to attach to the host intestine. The cytoskeleton is additionally involved in cell motility, membrane trafficking, mitosis, and cytokinesis. Although the actin-cytoskeleton is central for cell survival, Giardia does not have any canonical actin-binding proteins. Despite the number of processes the cytoskeleton contributes and having the most divergent actin-cytoskeleton of any eukaryote identified, very little is understood about the cellular and cytoskeletal dynamics during these events. The technical difficulties of performing live cell imaging in Giardia have hampered the understanding of these life-cycle events. This study developed live cell imaging and then used this tool to explore the cellular dynamics and molecular underpinnings of cytokinesis and the ventrolateral flange, a lamellipodia-like structure. Cytokinesis is completed in a myosin-independent manner that uses flagella to coordinate force generation and direct membrane trafficking. The ventrolateral flange is an enigmatic structure that reportedly aids in cell attachment. The <b>first</b> ventrolateral <b>flange</b> components were identified, actin, GlRac, and Flangin and found to be critical for its assembly. Taken together, live cell imaging was developed as a novel tool for giardial research that lead to new insights into cytokinesis and ventrolateral flange dynamics in the evolutionarily distant disease causing protist Giardia...|$|R
40|$|In this study, the {{optimization}} of {{the manufacturing}} conditions in veneer-strand-flanged I-beam production by steam-injection pressing and methods to further reduce the pressing time were investigated. The main results revealed that conventional hot pressing using diphenyl methane diisocyanate (MDI) resin between the strands {{as well as between}} the web and the flange produced I-beams within a pressing time of 8 min. This time was further reduced to 6 min by using steam-injection pressing. It was concluded that a primary steam injection duration of 10 s in the <b>first</b> stage of <b>flange</b> compression (75 -mm platen distance), followed by a 5 -s secondary steam injection duration while the press was closing was the optimal combination that yielded I-beams with balanced mechanical properties and dimensional stability. It was also observed that it was more appropriate to use a roll-press splitter for strand preparation instead of a saw-cutting method in the steam injection pressing technique...|$|R
50|$|The {{operation}} to extinguish {{the fire was}} very elaborate and preparation lasted almost a month, until January 2, 1981. A special pipeline was constructed, and the population of Poland was vividly interested in these events. Every day, hundreds of letters came to Karlino with {{suggestions on how to}} put the fire out. After long consideration, the specialists came up with the following solution. First, remnants of the destroyed oil well and blowout preventer were removed. The well was removed by a specially constructed tractor, equipped with a 30-m hook arm. The preventer, however, was destroyed by a cannon from a distance of 25 m. The task was to aim at a small crack between the <b>flanges.</b> <b>First</b> an 85 mm cannon was used, then a 122 mm howitzer, and finally on December 28, a 152 mm cannon-howitzer managed to destroy the preventer. After all the preparations, the fire was extinguished on January 8, 1981, almost a month after the eruption. The local Karlino Chronicle wrote: “At 10:42 a.m. a stream of water from 23 cannons was aimed at the burning geyser of oil. After 16 minutes, the fire went out, and specialists removed the damaged flanges”.|$|R
40|$|AbstractContinuous shear connection, using a cut steel strip, is an {{upcoming}} solution for composite beams. With the activation of friction {{on the sides}} of the steel strip this method has already been used to design and build large durable bridges during the sixties. However direct shear transmission into the steel strip though teeth of the cut is also possible and has been scrutinized with the support of the European Research Fund for Coal and Steel. It is characterized by a high initial stiffness, bearing capacity and ductility. It allows new and economic construction methods, as the PreCoBeams (Prefabricated Composite Beam used as formwork). PreCoBeams are for instance composite beams associating steel T-sections acting as tension member with a concrete top chord acting as compression member. Steel parts are generally obtained from rolled steel profiles that are longitudinally cut in two identical T-sections. The cut is performed with a special shape to allow the shear longitudinal transmission between steel and reinforced concrete. In general, prefabricated, composite, longitudinal PreCoBeam bridge elements are produced in factory. They consist of at least one steel T-section associated to a precast <b>first</b> phase concrete <b>flange.</b> Second phase concrete layer is then completed in-situ after erection of the bridge elements on abutments. These PreCoBeam bridges are very economic in design and construction, though the main market drawback for PreCoBeams is the missing design rules for the shear connection. This paper introduces the static and fatigue design of continuous steel plate shear connections used for PreCoBeams derived from the recent research activities. The CL shape of the cutting has been tested in fatigue, ultimate and service limit states and validated in the scope of a bridge application. This concept aims at developing a competitive solution for small span bridges. The various solutions realized in the last years in many European countries, some of them presented in the paper, show clearly its interest...|$|R
40|$|A {{detailed}} {{investigation was}} made to study the shear transfer between precast prestressed beams and in-situ concrete in a relatively new method of construction of continuous bridge decks where the ends of precast beams are connected to an integral in-situ crosshead away from the supports. Two series of tests were carried out. In the first series 1 / 3 scale models of the M. o. T, C&CA M- 8 sections were used, and these were modified in the second series to study {{the effect of the}} beam's top flanges within the connection. One of the most important mechanisms of shear transfer proved to be the top flanges of the precast beam. For the precast beams with top <b>flanges</b> (<b>first</b> series), and with a 300 mm beam embedment length, it was discovered that: a) The shear force is transferred from a small length {{at the end of the}} beam. b) The in-situ concrete nibs (concrete surrounding the web) can take this shear force without stirrups. c) There is no need either to project all the bars from the precast into the in-situ concrete or to prestress the connection transversely as a means of improving shear transfer. d) It was possible to transfer the whole shear force at the connection with a reduced embedment length of 100 mm with nib stirrups. For the precast beam without top flanges, the transfer of the shear force at the connection required other improving details. In this respect transverse prestressing and web shear connectors were utilized effectively. The effect of projecting bars was also examined. In the general behaviour of composite continuous beams subjected to shear a detailed comparison was made between different Code predictions for the web cracking shear and web crushing strength. A mathematical model is also proposed to predict the stirrup stress according to shear span, effective depth and stirrup ratio when failure is controlled by web crushing. Stirrup stress measurement in the vicinity of continuous support made it possible to predict the enhanced shear strength and a design method is proposed for the continuous beams. A comparion is also made between different Code predictions in this respect. To obtain more information about the strength of web shear connectors used in the secod series, a separate dowel shear specimen was designed. Different interface conditions including bond, dowel bar size and strength and the effect of shrinkage were examined. A design method is proposed together with a comparison with different Code predictions...|$|R
