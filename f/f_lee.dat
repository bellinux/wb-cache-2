5|$|Grand First Vice-President William A. Scroggs, {{founder of}} the fraternity, {{conducted}} the band in their first piece, Semper Fidelis. Max A. Mitchell, Grand Second Vice-President, conducted Leonard Smith's Spanish Caprice, a piece for band and solo cornet. Bohumil Makovsky, Past Grand President and Chairman of the Board of Trustees, conducted his march, Kappa Kappa Psi, and <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bowling conducted J. DeForest Cline's Kappa Kappa Psi march. The 1947 NIB was recognized as the first-ever intercollegiate band assembled with a national scope in the United States. Since 1947, the fraternity has presented the <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bowling Participation Award to the college or university who has had the most students participate in the National Intercollegiate Band, regardless of membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma. In {{the case of a}} tie, multiple awards are presented.|$|E
5|$|In 1836 a Cincinnati civil {{engineer}} (H. L. Barnum) {{was hired to}} plot the northern expansion of the town. This plan was again an attempt to use Jefferson's original. The plan {{was rejected by the}} town council and another plan from a local {{civil engineer}} (Edmund <b>F.</b> <b>Lee)</b> was accepted. At the time Cincinnati was the major town in the area and subsequent map makers used the Barnum map as their primary source. Consequently, most maps of Jeffersonville from 1837 to about 1852 are in error.|$|E
5|$|Mumma {{arrived back}} in the United States in December 1945, and {{returned}} to the Bureau of Ships. The Bureau's immediate post war priority was to develop nuclear propulsion for ships. With the Chief of the Bureau, Rear Admiral Earle W. Mills, and Captain Paul <b>F.</b> <b>Lee,</b> he went to see Groves and Brigadier General Kenneth Nichols, the commander of the Manhattan District, who were willing to help, but would not offer any fissionable material. The Navy decided to proceed with the design of a nuclear-powered ship.|$|E

5|$|Beginning in 1933, {{the first}} intercollegiate band was established, with musicians from the University of Colorado (home of the Alpha Iota chapter), the University of Denver (Alpha Lambda), Colorado State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (Kappa), Colorado State College of Education (Alpha Theta), the Colorado School of Mines (Xi), and the University of Utah participating. In 1934, the University of Utah left the intercollegiate band and the University of Wyoming (Alpha Nu) took its place. The concerts held by this intercollegiate band were {{sponsored}} by the local chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and {{many members of the}} fraternity were involved with the ensemble, including <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bowling, who served as the band's manager.|$|E
5|$|<b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bowling {{was elected}} Grand President of the {{fraternity}} in 1941 and presented {{a plan to}} hold a national intercollegiate band concert, modeled after the Rocky Mountain intercollegiate bands. The plan was endorsed by the delegation to be executed at the next national convention in 1943. However, due to World War II, the 1943 and 1945 national conventions were not held, and so the first National Intercollegiate Band was formed and gave a concert {{on the evening of}} Friday, March 7, 1947. Today, participation in the National Intercollegiate Band is open to any college band member who auditions—membership in Kappa Kappa Psi or Tau Beta Sigma is not required.|$|E

They argued that Simpson {{was the victim of}} police fraud and what they termed as sloppy internal procedures, which had contaminated the DNA evidence.|$|E
25|$|Hearst's {{attorney}} <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bailey {{used the}} Stockholm Syndrome argument {{as part of}} the defense at trial. During Hearst's subsequent trial, her lawyer claimed that she had been confined in a closet barely large enough for her to lie down in; that her {{contact with the outside world}} was regulated by her captors; and that she was regularly threatened with execution. Hearst's lawyer contended that she had been raped by DeFreeze and Wolfe. Both died before Hearst's capture and trial. The SLA claimed to be holding Hearst according to the conditions of the Geneva Conventions.|$|E

25|$|PFC Michael Bernhardt – Rifleman; {{he dropped}} out of the University of Miami to {{volunteer}} for the Army. Bernhardt refused to kill civilians in My Lai. Later, Captain Ernest Medina threatened Bernhardt, trying to deter him from exposing the massacre. As a result, Bernhardt was given more dangerous assignments such as point duty on patrol. He would later be afflicted with a form of trench foot as a direct result. Bernhardt told Ronald Ridenhour, who was not present in My Lai during the massacre, about the events, thus pushing him to continue his investigation. Later he would help expose and detail the massacre in numerous interviews with the press, and he served as a prosecution witness in the trial of Medina, where he was subjected to intense cross examination by defense counsel <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bailey backed by a team of attorneys including Gary Myers. Michael Bernhardt is a recipient of the New York Society for Ethical Culture's 1970 Ethical Humanist Award.|$|E
25|$|In {{producing}} the special, the only existing master 16mm prints {{of the original}} series kinescope films were removed from storage and brought to a Manhattan editing facility that Goodson-Todman Productions rented. There, company employees Gil Fates, Bob Bach, Pamela Usdan and Bill Egan worked round-the-clock for three days to compile the 90-minute special under deadline pressure from ABC network official Bob Shanks. In the process of viewing and editing the films for the special, they accidentally damaged or destroyed several kinescope films which spanned the entire run of the original series, including a few that {{did not make the}} final cut of the retrospective. In addition, some unspooled film remained on the floor after the group's rented time at the facility ran out. An April 1967 episode featuring Candice Bergen as the mystery guest was lost in its entirety, as was a June 1967 episode featuring both Betty Grable and <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bailey. Other episodes sustained only partial damage, such as a 1965 episode that is mainly damaged during the mystery guest appearance of Marian Anderson.|$|E
500|$|In the meantime, {{the first}} Kappa Kappa Psi-sponsored intercollegiate band was {{established}} by <b>F.</b> <b>Lee</b> Bowling in 1933, with musicians from the University of Colorado (home of the Alpha Iota chapter of Kappa Kappa Psi), the University of Denver (Alpha Lambda), Colorado State College of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (Kappa), Colorado State College of Education (Alpha Theta), the Colorado School of Mines (Xi), and the University of Utah participating. In 1934, the University of Utah left the intercollegiate band and the University of Wyoming (Alpha Nu) took its place. The concerts held by this Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Band were sponsored by the local chapters of Kappa Kappa Psi and {{many members of the}} fraternity participated in the ensemble. The first concert of the Rocky Mountain Intercollegiate Band was held in February 1933, and the band gave annual concerts during Denver Music Week. Bowling left the band's managership in 1937.|$|E

2500|$|Given {{that many}} Freemasons {{are members of}} Lions Clubs, and its founder, Melvin Jones, was also a Freemason, modern {{conspiracy}} theories have claimed that the Lions are connected to and act cohesively with Freemasonry.

It says that the [...] "Freemasons are apparently in cahoots with the Lions Clubs and involved in plots ranging from the distribution of aspartame to control the human mind, {{to the death of}} John Paul I, to an apparent plot to spread Zionism." ...|$|R
