A major QTL was identified on chromosome 3 BL near the centromere in all environments. Seedling testing showed that Sr 12 mapped to the same region as the QTL for APR. The SNP markers were physically mapped and the region carrying the resistance was searched for sequences with homology to members of the NB-LRR resistance gene family.

Molecular fingerprinting by RAPD markers indicated that an apomictic 4 x accession of P. guenoarum was the pollen parent. Meiotic chromosome pairing in the hypotriploid hybrid averaged 16. 3 univalents (range 9 - 29), 5. 4 bivalents (0 - 9), and 0. 7 trivalents (0 - 3). Since P. guenoarum has an autopolyploid or segmental allopolyploid origin, the biva-lent associations in the hypotriploid hybrid could be ascribed to an autosyndetic pairing {{between the two}} chromo-some sets contributed by the male parent. The trivalent chromosome associations suggested some degree of homol-ogy between the chromosomes of P. limbatum and P. guenoarum. Embryological analysis of the hypotriploid hybrid showed complete abortion of the megaspore mother cell before or during the first meiotic division. One to several aposporous embryo sacs developed from somatic nucellar cells in over 97 % of the ovules analysed. The plant was 100 % male sterile and seed sterility reached 99. 9 %, despite hand-pollination with several pollen sources.

Despite such potentially mutual benefits, {{little research has been}} carried out into CGW and earthworm interactions with trees on reclaimed land. A twelve month, open <b>field</b> <b>nursery</b> experiment revealed the responses of the interactions between two tree species; Alnus cordata (Betulaceae) and Acer platanoides (Sapindaceae), CGW and the earthworms Aporrectodea longa (Lumbricidae) and Allolobophora chlorotica (Lumbricidae) in reclaimed soil. Controlled mesocosm conditions permitted a detailed investigation into the factors affecting tree growth and nutrient uptake, soil nutrient cycling and earthworm population dynamics. Results revealed that A. cordata growth was unaffected by CGW or earthworm addition. There was, however, a significant positive synergistic effect of earthworm activity and CGW addition on A. platanoides growth. CGW addition significantly increased levels of organic carbon and essential plant macro-nutrients in reclaimed soil while earthworm activity assisted decomposition of both leaf litter and CGW.

In this study, we generated transgenic rice lines harbouring a hairpin RNA (hpRNA) construct targeting four RBSDV genes, S 1, S 2, S 6 and S 10, encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, the putative core protein, the RNA silencing suppressor and the outer capsid protein, respectively.
