5000|$|A {{study done}} after the Dutch Hunger Winter of 1944-1945 showed that {{undernutrition}} {{during the early}} stages of pregnancy are associated with hypomethylation of the insulin-like growth factor II (IGF2) gene even after six decades. These individuals had significantly lower methylation rates as compared to their same sex sibling who had not been conceived during the famine. A comparison was done with children conceived prior to the famine so that their mothers were nutrient deprived during the later stages of gestation; these children had normal methylation patterns. The IGF2 stands for insulin-like growth factor II; this gene is a key contributor in human growth and development. IGF2 gene is also maternally imprinted meaning that the mother’s gene is silenced. The mother’s gene is typically methylated at the differentially methylated region (DMR); however, when hypomethylated, the gene is bi-allelically expressed. Thus, individuals with lower methylation states likely lost some of the imprinting effect. Similar results have been demonstrated in the Nr3c1 and Ppara <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> of rats fed on an isocaloric protein-deficient diet before starting pregnancy. This further implies that the undernutrition was the cause of the epigenetic changes. Surprisingly, there was not a correlation between methylation states and birth weight. This displayed that birth weight may not be an adequate way to determine nutritional status during gestation. This study stressed that epigenetic effects vary depending on the timing of exposure and that early stages of mammalian development are crucial periods for establishing epigenetic marks. Those exposed earlier in gestation had decreased methylation while those who were exposed at the end of gestation had relatively normal methylation levels. [...] The offspring and descendants of mothers with hypomethylation were more likely to develop cardiovascular disease. Epigenetic alterations that occur during embryogenesis and early fetal development have greater physiologic and metabolic effects because they are transmitted over more mitotic divisions. In other words, the epigenetic changes that occur earlier are more likely to persist in more cells.|$|E

However, whether maternal high-fat feeding can modulate glucose and lipid metabolism {{in the early}} life of offspring is less understood. Furthermore, we explored the underlying mechanisms that influence the phenotype. Using C 57 BL/ 6 J mice, we examined the effects on the offspring at weaning from dams fed with a high-fat diet or normal chow diet throughout pregnancy and lactation. Gene array experiments and quantitative real-time PCR were performed in the liver tissues of the offspring mice. The offspring of the dams fed the high-fat diet had a heavier body weight, impaired glucose tolerance, decreased insulin sensitivity, increased serum cholesterol and hepatic steatosis at weaning. Bioinformatic analyses indicated that all differentially expressed <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> {{between the two groups}} were mapped to nine pathways. Genes in the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) signaling pathway were verified by quantitative real-time PCR and these genes were significantly up-regulated in the high-fat diet offspring.

40|$|Summaryvon Hippel-Lindau disease (VHL [MIM 193300]) is a {{heritable}} {{autosomal dominant}} multiple-neoplastic disorder with high penetrance. It {{is characterized by}} brain and spinal-cord hemangioblastomas, retinal angiomas, clear-cell renal carcinoma, neuroendocrine tumors and cysts <b>of</b> <b>the</b> pancreas, pheochromocytomas, endolymphatic-sac tumors, and papillary cystadenomas <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epididymis and broad ligament. Although most index cases have a positive family history of VHL, some do not and may represent de novo cases. Cases without {{a family history of}} VHL {{may or may not have}} a germline mutation in their VHL tumor-suppressor gene. We present two cases of VHL mosaicism. In each of two families, standard testing methods (Southern blot analysis and direct sequencing) identified the germline mutation in <b>the</b> VHL <b>gene</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring,</b> but not in their clinically affected parent. Additional methods <b>of</b> analysis <b>of</b> <b>the</b> affected parents' blood detected the VHL-gene mutation in a portion of their peripheral blood lymphocytes. In one case, detection <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deleted allele was by FISH, and, in the second case, the 3 -bp deletion was detected by conformational sensitive gel electrophoresis and DNA sequencing of cloned genomic DNA. Mosaicism in VHL is important to search for and recognize when an individual without a family history of VHL has VHL. Patients diagnosed without family histories <b>of</b> <b>the</b> disease have been reported in as many as 23 % of kindreds with VHL. Identification of individuals potentially mosaic for VHL will affect counseling of families, and these individuals should themselves be included in clinical screening programs for occult disease...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE OF REVIEW: Pregnancy {{is arguably}} the most {{critical}} period of developmental programming. Here, we particularly focus on the emerging paradigm that disease propensity is epigenetically determined by maternal exposures that have the capacity to activate or silence fetal genes through alterations in DNA and histone methylation, histone acetylation, and chromatin structure. RECENT FINDINGS: The most notable recent candidate to emerge in this role has been dietary folate, a methyl donor clearly associated with changes in gene expression and disease susceptibility through gene hypermethylation. Animal studies also provide the first evidence that the allergy protective effects of microbial exposure in pregnancy may be mediated by changes in methylation of Th 1 <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring.</b> There is also emerging evidence that perinatal differences in immune function of allergy-prone newborns extend beyond previously recognized differences in effector T cell (Th 1 /Th 2) function, to also include differences in neonatal regulatory T cell (Treg) and Th 17 function, and moreover, that these pathways are also epigenetically regulated. SUMMARY: New studies reinforce the importance of in-utero exposures (including dietary nutrients, microbial products, cigarette smoking, and certain maternal mediations) in fetal immune development and in programming the susceptibility to asthma and allergic disease.

30|$|Even {{though the}} rate of {{convergence}} of both the TLBO and JAYA is good, {{it is observed that}} when these algorithms are directly applied to solve the FFSP, they show a good tendency to be struck at the local optimum due to lack of diversity in the population. Therefore, as the iterations proceed, all the populations get converged to a local optimum and there is no improvement in the solution there after. To avoid this drawback, mutation strategy from genetic algorithm is incorporated to each of these basic algorithms after the local search step. Singh and Mahapatra (2012) have applied this mutation strategy to PSO for solving FFSP. Mutation is defined as a sudden change that occurs in the <b>genes</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> when compared to that of parent genes during the evolution process. Out of the total population, a fixed percentage of population will undergo mutation. In this case, the percentage is fixed to three percent. It is based on the computational experiments conducted and it is explained in Fig.  5 under results and discussion. This mutation technique is implemented only if there is no improvement in the best solution for every fixed number of iterations. In the present case, mutation is applied if no improvement is observed in five iterations. This technique prevents the population converging to the local optimum and directs the same to the global optimum. After the incorporation of mutation strategy, we observe a good improvement in the quality of results produced by these two algorithms.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: We {{analysed}} <b>the</b> morphology <b>of</b> nestling barn swallows (Hirundo rustica) {{in relation}} to their sex, and laying and hatching order. In addition, we studied sex-allocation {{in relation to}} parentage, parental age and expression of a secondary sexual character of fathers. Molecular sexing was conducted using the sex chromosome-linked avian CHD 1 <b>gene.</b> Sex <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> was not associated with laying or hatching order. None of nine morphological, serological and immunological variables varied in relation to offspring sex. Sexual dimorphism did not vary in relation to parental age and expression of a paternal secondary sexual character. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> sons declined with brood size. Individual males and females had a similar proportion of sons during consecutive breeding years. <b>The</b> proportion <b>of</b> sons of individual females declined with age, but increased with <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> a secondary sexual character of their current mate. <b>The</b> generalized lack <b>of</b> variation in sexual dimorphism among nestlings may suggest that barn swallows do not differentially invest in sons vs. daughters. Alternatively, male offspring may require different parental effort compared to their female siblings in order to attain the same morphological state. <b>The</b> lack <b>of</b> variation in offspring sexual dimorphism with paternal ornamentation suggests no adjustment of overall parental effort in relation to reproductive value <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two sexes. However, male-biased sex ratio among offspring of highly ornamented males may represent an adaptive sex-allocation strategy because <b>the</b> expression <b>of</b> male ornaments is heritable and highly ornamented males are at a sexual selection advantage...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background In rodent {{models and}} in humans <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> gestational diets on <b>the</b> <b>offspring's</b> {{phenotype}} was shown experimentally and epidemiologically. Adverse environmental conditions during fetal development provoke an intrauterine adaptive response termed 'fetal programming', which {{may lead to}} both persistently biased responsiveness to extrinsic factors and permanent consequences for the organismal phenotype. This leads to the hypothesis that <b>the</b> <b>offspring's</b> transcriptome exhibits short-term and long-term changes, depending on the maternal diet. In order {{to contribute to a}} comprehensive inventory <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> and functional networks that are targets of nutritional programming initiated during fetal life, we applied whole-genome microarrays for expression profiling in a longitudinal experimental design covering prenatal, perinatal, juvenile, and adult ontogenetic stages in a porcine model. Pregnant sows were fed either a gestational low protein diet (LP, 6 % CP) or an adequate protein diet (AP, 12 % CP). All offspring was nursed by foster sows receiving standard diets. After weaning, all offspring was fed standard diets ad libitum. Results Analyses <b>of</b> <b>the</b> hepatic <b>gene</b> expression <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> at prenatal (94 dies post conceptionem, dpc) and postnatal stages (1, 28, 188 dies post natum, dpn) included comparisons between dietary groups within stages as well as comparisons between ontogenetic stages within diets to separate diet-specific transcriptional changes and maturation processes. We observed differential expression <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> related to lipid metabolism (e. g. Fatty acid metabolism, Biosynthesis of steroids, Synthesis and degradation of ketone bodies, FA elongation in mitochondria, Bile acid synthesis) and cell cycle regulation (e. g. Mitotic roles of PLK, G 1 /S checkpoint regulation, G 2 /M DNA damage checkpoint regulation). Notably, at stage 1 dpn no regulation of a distinct pathway was found in LP <b>offspring.</b> Conclusions <b>The</b> transcriptomic modulations point to persistent functional demand on the liver towards cell proliferation in the LP group but not in the AP group at identical nutritional conditions during postnatal life due to divergent 'programming' <b>of</b> <b>the</b> genome. Together with the observation that <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> <b>of</b> both groups did not differ in body weight but in body composition and fat content, the data indicate that <b>the</b> activity <b>of</b> various <b>genes</b> led to diverse partitioning of nutrients among peripheral and visceral organs and tissues. </p...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe gap {{junction}} gene Connexin 31. 1 {{has been reported}} to be expressed predominantly in <b>the</b> epidermis <b>of</b> murine skin. To study <b>the</b> function <b>of</b> this <b>gene,</b> we generated mice in which <b>the</b> coding DNA <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Connexin 31. 1 gene was replaced by lacZ reporter coding DNA. Using β-galactosidase staining, we have shown that lacZ/Connexin 31. 1 was expressed in the spinous and granular layers <b>of</b> <b>the</b> epidermis, in cells of olfactory epithelium and in the vomeronasal organ. During embryogenesis, Connexin 31. 1 was co-expressed with another isoform, Connexin 31, in the post-implantation trophoblast cell lineage and, later in gestation, in placental glycogen cells. Although homozygous Connexin 31. 1 -deficient mice were fertile and showed no morphological or functional defects in adult organs expressing this <b>gene,</b> 30 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>offspring</b> expected according to Mendelian inheritance were lost between embryonic days 11. 5 and 14. 5 and surviving embryos were significantly reduced in weight near <b>the</b> end <b>of</b> pregnancy. Placentas of Connexin 31. 1 -deficient embryos were reduced in weight and showed altered morphology <b>of</b> <b>the</b> spongiotrophoblast and labyrinth layer. The spongiotrophoblast formed a compact barrier at the decidual border that might restrict the maternal blood supply. We conclude that Connexin 31. 1 is critical for normal placental development but appears to be functionally compensated by other connexin isoforms in the embryo proper and adult mouse...|$|R
40|$|Genetic Programming {{is a form}} of Evolutionary Computation {{in which}} {{computer}} programs are evolved by methods based on simulating <b>the</b> natural evolution <b>of</b> biological species. A new generation of a species acquires <b>the</b> characteristics <b>of</b> previous generations through <b>the</b> inheritance <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> by sexual reproduction and through random changes in alleles by random mutation. The new generation may enhance its ability to survive by <b>the</b> acquisition <b>of</b> cultural knowledge through learning processes. This thesis combines <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> knowledge by genetic means with <b>the</b> transfer <b>of</b> knowledge by cultural means. In particular, it introduces a new evolutionary operator, memory operator. In conventional genetic programming systems, a new generation is formed from a mating pool whose members are selected from <b>the</b> fittest members <b>of</b> previous generation. <b>The</b> new generation is produced by <b>the</b> exchange <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> between members <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mating pool and <b>the</b> random replacement <b>of</b> <b>genes</b> in <b>the</b> <b>offspring.</b> <b>The</b> new generation {{may or may not be}} able to survive better than its predecessor in a given environment. The memory operator augments the evolutionary process by inserting into new chromosomes genetic material known to often result in fitness improvements. This material is acquired through a learning process in which the system is required to evolve generations that survive in a less demanding environment. The cultural knowledge acquired in this learning process is applied as an intelligent form of mutation to aid survival in a more demanding environment...|$|R
