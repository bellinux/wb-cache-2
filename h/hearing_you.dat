Vineyard {{went on to say that}} it [...] "...wistfully evokes the sounds of the '80s-era dance clubs that first lofted her toward stardom." [...] According to a review in the BBC's Collective, [...] "New single 'Sorry' states Queen Madge's unapologetic stance, and though the song is wrapped up in {{relationship}} sentiment, one cannot help but hear the subtext, perhaps directed at her more savage critics: 'there are more important things than <b>hearing</b> <b>you</b> speak'." [...] Alan Braidwood from BBC Music called the song [...] "lethally catchy". Mike Pattenden of The Times and Sal Cinquemani from Slant Magazine noted that the bassline of the song utilizes The Jacksons' 1980 song [...] "Can You Feel It". The song was noted by Slant Magazine as one of the best songs of 2006. In a review of [...] "Sorry" [...] from Virgin Media, it wrote that the song's musicscape features an [...] "infectious combo of pumping, filtered synths and disco beats". Keith Caulfield from Billboard commented that, [...] " [...] should keep fans hung up on Madonna's ability to create instant radio and club classics." [...] He also called the song [...] "springy" [...] while reviewing the album.|$|E
