500|$|Unlike most {{anthropomorphic}} cars, {{the eyes}} of the cars in this film were placed on the windshield (which resembles the Tonka Talking Trucks, and the characters from Tex Avery's One Cab's Family short and Disney's own Susie the Little Blue Coupe), rather than within the headlights. According to production designer Bob Pauley, [...] "From the very beginning of this project, John Lasseter had it in his mind to have the eyes be in the windshield. For one thing, it separates our characters from the more common approach where you have little cartoon eyes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlights.</b> For another, he thought that having the eyes down near the mouth at {{the front end of the}} car feels more like a snake. With the eyes set in the windshield, the point of view is more human-like, and made it feel like the whole car could be involved in the animation of the character. This decision was heavily criticized by automotive blog Jalopnik.|$|E
500|$|After {{playing for}} England in the Tri-series in Australia {{at the start}} of the year, Buttler was once again {{involved}} with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side as first choice Test wicket-keeper during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Boycott, saying [...] "Jos Buttler is like a rabbit caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> of Ashes cricket. A seven-year-old schoolboy would have played better. He hasn't made a run all series. He hasn't shown any application whatsoever. It looks to me like his mind and confidence is shot for Test cricket – it's pathetic." [...] He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand.|$|E
500|$|By December 2013, Madonna's manager Guy Oseary {{commented that}} the singer was [...] "eager to get started" [...] on her next album. However, she had another project in mind – {{developing}} the screenplay for the Andrew Sean Greer novel, The Impossible Lives of Greta Wells. Madonna decided to split her time between writing the screenplay and writing songs for the new album. In February 2014, Madonna confirmed that she had already begun working on her thirteenth studio album, saying: [...] "I'm {{right now in the}} process of talking to various co-writers and producers and talking about where I want to go with my music". Working with a number of collaborators on the album, Madonna encountered problems in keeping a cohesive sound and creative direction for Rebel Heart, since her previous efforts had been produced with only a small core group of people developing the music. She observed that a lot of the people she enlisted would not stay in one city at a time due to their different projects, resulting in Madonna not finishing her songs. [...] "So, I was just the person standing there with a clipboard <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlights,</b> going 'Ok!' A little bit like a school teacher," [...] she admitted.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} use high power {{headlights}} on heavy duty vehicles, an automatic mechanism for adjusting {{the level of}} <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> must be used. This is {{in order to avoid}} glare while still maintaining good visibility. For headlights exceeding 2000 lumen, this control must be done automatically. The main reason for a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> level is when the truck is being loaded, and the suspension is compressed causing <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> to point slightly up or down. Due to inherent limitations of the Scania trucks, the most commonly used approach of estimating the vehicle pitch angle is not possible to implement. Thus, a set of pitch estimation methods largely using sensors detecting acceleration are investigated and presented. Further, three methods are chosen for further study and evaluation. One method using previously recorded data about road slope as well as an on board acceleration sensor is shown to produce a high quality vehicle pitch estimate...|$|R
2500|$|The active visual {{warnings}} {{are usually}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> form of flashing colored lights (also known as 'beacons' or 'lightbars'). [...] These flash {{in order to}} attract the attention of other road users as the police car approaches, or to provide warning to motorists approaching a stopped vehicle in a dangerous position on the road. [...] Common colours for police warning beacons are blue and red, however this often varies by force. Several types of flashing lights are used, such as rotating beacons, halogen lights, or light emitting diode strobes. Some police forces also use arrow sticks to direct traffic, or message display boards to provide short messages or instructions to motorists. <b>The</b> <b>headlights</b> of some vehicles can be made to flash, or small strobe lights can be fitted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlight,</b> tail light and indicator lights of the vehicle.|$|R

500|$|Dönitz was {{aided by}} {{high-quality}} photographs from a reconnaissance overflight by Siegfried Knemeyer, (who received his first Iron Cross for the mission), and which revealed {{the weaknesses of}} the defences and an abundance of targets. He directed Prien to enter Scapa Flow from its east via Kirk Sound, passing {{to the north of}} Lamb Holm, a small low-lying island between Burray and Mainland. Prien initially mistook the more southerly Skerry Sound for the chosen route and his sudden realisation that U-47 was heading for the shallow blocked passage forced him to order a rapid turn to the northeast. On the surface, and illuminated by a bright display of the aurora borealis, the submarine threaded between the sunken blockships Seriano and Numidian, grounding itself temporarily on a cable strung from Seriano. It was briefly caught <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlights</b> of a taxi onshore, but the driver raised no alarm. On entering the harbour proper at 00:27 on 14 October, Prien entered a triumphant [...] in the log and set a south-westerly course for several kilometres before reversing direction. To his surprise, the anchorage appeared to be almost empty; unknown to him, Forbes' order to disperse the fleet had removed some of the biggest targets. U-47 had been heading directly towards four warships, including the newly commissioned light cruiser , anchored off Flotta and Hoy 4 nautical miles (8km, 5mi) distant, but Prien gave no indication that he had seen them.|$|E
2500|$|Mireille {{was invited}} to Paris by the {{impresario}} Régis Durcourt to sing on the [...] "Song Parade" [...] television program, on 19 November 1965. Stark promised to write to her, but after months of waiting she gave up on him, and accepted Durcourt's offer. The truth has never been revealed how, but Mireille was suddenly moved-up to compete live on the Sunday 21 November 1965 episode of [...] "Jeu de la Chance," [...] a talent segment of the popular French program [...] "Télé-Dimanche." [...] Stark's ex-wife Nanou Taddéi worked at Studio 102, and probably recognized Mireille, as she participated in her earlier pre-audition. Mathieu explained that [...] "Song Parade" [...] offered only one chance to sing, while [...] "Jeu de la Chance" [...] offered many chances to sing, but only if she won, and she intended to win. Both the studio audience and telephone voters gave her a slight lead over five-time winner , so the producers called it a tie. Johnny Stark officially became her manager that night, and with his longtime assistant Nadine Joubert, helped prepare Mireille to win the contest the following week and bury Georgette. Stark and Lemaire had a mutual dislike for each other. In a short film called La guerre des Piaf (War of the Sparrows) Georgette and Mireille are interviewed separately, both are small and the same height. Mireille is surrounded by her sisters Monique and Christiane, with Johnny hovering in the background as she is interviewed {{for the first time}} on camera. She appears to be uncomfortable, staring at the floor during many of the questions, even looking dumbfounded once, like a deer <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlights.</b> Johnny finally comes to her rescue. In a later interview, she underscored the importance of the event, stating, [...] "For me, Paris was the end of the world. I never took a train or saw a camera before. I did not know what the outcome of the adventure would be." ...|$|E

50|$|A hub dynamo {{enables a}} {{built-in}} lighting system without the loud noise and high drag of a bottle (sidewall) dynamo, {{and without the}} unreliability, high cost, ecological disposal problem, and maintenance inherent with batteries. The hub dynamo powers LED or halogen front and rear lights. The lights have a built-in reflector. The taillight is mounted cleanly on the rear rack or fender. A built-in reflector <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>headlight</b> and taillight surrounds or is adjacent to the LED or light bulb. Built-in lights stay on point, i.e., need no adjustments.The latest systems include a capacitor-powered standlight, powered {{for a few minutes}} by a capacitor. This prevents the lights from going out as soon as the bike speed drops to less than a few miles per hour; this evens out the amount of light at various speeds, sustaining the light at lower speeds.|$|R

50|$|The US {{government}} imposed {{tariff rate}} hikes for foreign-built motorcycles over 700 cc {{in order to}} combat their rise in sales in North America, and to aid the domestic motorcycle manufacturers, namely Harley-Davidson.

The seats were changed to a wider 2 piece design {{in an attempt to}} improve rider comfort. The rear shocks also changed to eliminate the extra fluid reservoir. The wheels were different as well. Honda only made the VF700 for the late part of 1984, 1985, 1986, and 1987, then back to the VF750 after that. The first part of 1984, the Magnas were VF750.|$|R
