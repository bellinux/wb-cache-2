Based on the method of water beam assisted form error in-process optical measurement, a new air beam approach was proposed {{to solve the problems}} of coolant dilution and optical transmittance through multiple media. In order to identify key parameters to reduce the workload of experimental tests, a <b>factorial</b> <b>test</b> was conducted on transparent window size A(t) and stability e(st). Calibration and assessment of A(t) and e(st) were introduced. <b>Factorial</b> <b>test</b> design was also examined. Results of the study show that v(t), v(a), and d(a) are the key parameters on A(t). Although all 6 main parameters are not significant, v(t) is relatively more important on e(st). When v(t) increases, A(t) will decrease. When v(a) or d(a) increases, A(t) will increase. The findings agree with our understanding of the physical process of fluid flow. When v(t) decreases, the transparent window size stability e(st) will be better. Consider both stability e(st) and air velocity v(a), Run 11 should be the best choice of conditions for A(t). A larger transparent window size A(t) typically gives better transparent window size stability e(st). To achieve a balance between e(st) and v(a), a suitable size of transparent window at A(t) =similar to 30 mm(2) should be a good choice. Further studies are necessary to confirm the findings...|$|E

In addition, partially renewable resources serve to model complicated labor regulations. Furthermore, they cover traditional renewable and nonrenewable resource constraints as special cases. We consider makespan minimization as objective. For the exact solution of the problem we employ a basic enumeration scheme. In order to speed up convergence, we formulate bounds which take into account future resource consumption of partially renewable resources.

Microalgae {{are used}} {{in a number of}} {{commercial}} applications including biofuel production, nutraceuticals, and as feedstock for aquaculture. Typical methods for harvesting microalgae like centrifugation, microfiltration, and foam fractionation are extremely energy intensive. Reducing the energy input for harvesting microalgae would improve the overall energy balance for algae based biofuels and benefit any industry where algae is required. One method for harvesting microalgae is electrolytic flotation (electroflotation). This is simply using electrolysis-generated bubbles to float particles out of suspension and to the surface. The primary objective of this research project is to examine the effects that electrical waveform characteristics have on bubble size, gas generation efficiency, biomass separation, and lipid separation of Chlorella sp. from a marine media.

Conventionally the final surface quality is produced by manual polishing operations. This expensive time-consuming production step can be reduced significantly by using machine hammer peening (MHP) and deep rolling (DR). For both processes the emphasis of each process parameter on the resulting surface topographyis largely unknown. This gap of knowledge about significant and non-significant parameters needs to be closed {{in order to allow}} a fast process optimization and more economic use of both methods. Therefore this study focuses on figuring out the statistically secured effect of each process parameter on the attainable surface smoothing on cast iron and tool steel.
