This means that the diver should consider any dive <b>done</b> <b>before</b> equilibration as a repetitive dive, {{even if it is}} the first dive in several days.|$|E

5|$|Due to cost increases, several {{features}} of the subway were cut back soon after construction started. Notably, the 72nd Street Station was truncated from a three-track, two-platform design to a two-track, single island platform design, paired with a simplification of the connection to the Broadway Line spur. This design change was <b>done</b> <b>before</b> the actual construction started. The MTA also pushed back its completion date to 2014. In its 2008 capital improvement budget proposal, the MTA further postponed completion of Phase 1 to 2015, and in 2009, the MTA rescheduled it again to 2016.|$|E

5|$|Isabel Macedo {{had played}} several villains, {{including}} in Floricienta, {{and took the}} Patricia Longo-Jimena Benitez role because it was something she had not <b>done</b> <b>before.</b> Although Patricia's past identity as Jimena {{was intended to be}} a secret for only ten episodes, Macedo insisted that the mystery should be maintained for a longer time. She read about victims of school bullying to inform her character and declined other work during the year to stay focused on the series, becoming emotionally attached to her character.|$|E
5|$|Maybe mid-year; {{safe to say}} {{towards the}} end {{but not at the}} end, maybe like eight months or {{something}} like that. Best thing about it is we’re going to do it whenever we want to do it. There is no deadline right now, we don’t have any dates set, we don’t have the studio, we’re going to do the record ourselves. So we will literally go in and record it and it will be probably be <b>done</b> <b>before</b> we sign a contract.|$|E
5|$|Mehmed II and {{his successors}} {{continued}} to consider themselves heirs to the Roman Empire until {{the demise of}} the Ottoman Empire in the early 20th century following World War 1. They considered that they had simply shifted its religious basis as Constantine had <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> and they continued to refer to their conquered Eastern Roman inhabitants (Orthodox Christians) as Rûm. Meanwhile, the Danubian Principalities (whose rulers also considered themselves the heirs of the Eastern Roman Emperors) harboured Orthodox refugees, including some Byzantine nobles.|$|E

5|$|Terraforming is {{a natural}} {{outgrowth}} of colonizing an alien world. The first playable prototype was just a map generator that tested climate changes during the game. This required the designers to create a world builder program and climatic model far more powerful than anything they'd <b>done</b> <b>before.</b> Temperature, wind, and rainfall patterns were modeled in ways that allow players to make changes: for example, creating a ridge-line and then watching the effects. In addition to raising terrain, the player can also divert rivers, dig huge boreholes into the planet's mantle, and melt ice caps.|$|E
5|$|The {{success of}} the game led to a sequel, Halo2, which was {{announced}} on August 8, 2002, at Microsoft's New York City X02 press event. It featured improved graphics, new weapons, and a multiplayer mode on Xbox Live. Halo3 was announced at the 2006 Electronic Entertainment Expo. The initial conception for the third game was <b>done</b> <b>before</b> Halo2 was released in 2004. It utilized a proprietary, in-house graphics engine, and employed advanced graphics technologies.|$|E
5|$|When Refn {{read the}} first {{screenplay}} for Drive, he was more intrigued by {{the concept of a}} man having a split personality, being a stuntman by day and a getaway driver at night, than the story itself.

Refn took on the project without hesitation.|$|E

5|$|Companies {{object to}} being blamed for shark bite incidents, {{pointing}} out that lightning tends to strike humans more often than sharks bite humans. Their position is that further {{research needs to be}} <b>done</b> <b>before</b> banning practices such as chumming, which may alter natural behavior. One compromise is to only use chum in areas where whites actively patrol anyway, well away from human leisure areas. Also, responsible dive operators do not feed sharks. Only sharks that are willing to scavenge follow the chum trail and if they find no food at the end then the shark soon swims off and does not associate chum with a meal. It has been suggested that government licensing strategies may help enforce these responsible tourism.|$|E
5|$|Development {{was almost}} {{complete}} with only minor polishing to be <b>done</b> <b>before</b> {{the game was}} {{to be released in}} 2011. A playable demo of Duke Nukem Forever was released once Gearbox figured out the timing, with purchasers of the Game of the Year Edition of Borderlands gaining early access. The demo is unexpectedly different from the versions available at PAX and Firstlook. Those that purchased Borderlands on Valve's Steam prior to October 12, 2010 got the code for the demo without the need to buy the Game of the Year edition of the game. Duke Nukem Forever was initially scheduled for release on May 3 in the United States and May 6 internationally and after another delay was finally released on June 14 in North America and June 10 worldwide, nearly four weeks after the game had 'gone gold' within 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Jon Haraldsson {{was killed}} in 1231, at Thurso in Caithness. He was contested by Snaekoll Gunnisson, a {{great-grandson}} of Rognvald Kali, who had demanded that Jon should share the Earldom with him, as had been <b>done</b> <b>before.</b> Jon's supporters and Snaekoll's fought a war until {{it was agreed that}} King Haakon Sverreson should settle the matter. All concerned set off to Norway, but a ship carrying Earl Jon, his supporters, and his kin, was lost at sea on the return voyage. As a result, the line of Norse Earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 Orkney was without an Earl. In 1236 the Earldom was granted by Haakon IV of Norway, to Magnus, son of Gille Brigte, Mormaer of Angus. Although ruled by Angus, Strathearn and Sinclair lords thereafter, Orkney remained part of the kingdom of Norway.|$|E

5|$|Monson {{initiated}} French-speaking proselytizing {{efforts in}} Quebec. He directed increased missionary work to {{immigrants from the}} Netherlands, Germany, Poland, Italy, Soviet Union and Hungary. Jacob de Jager, a future LDS general authority, was among the immigrant converts. Monson encouraged members to remain in eastern Canada, instead of migrating to Utah or Alberta as many members had <b>done</b> <b>before,</b> to help build the church's presence. To help encourage members to stay in Canada, increase the perception of permanence, and better reach potential converts, he started a major construction program for new meetinghouses. Until then, most branches had used rented halls.|$|E

In a letter to ministers, dated September 6, Tkach {{announced that he was}} also diagnosed with bone cancer. He elected not to undertake radiation treatments. As Armstrong had <b>done</b> <b>before</b> him, Tkach named a successor to become pastor general in the event of his death. In that case, it was Tkach's son, Joseph Tkach Jr.|$|E
5|$|On {{the first}} Air Force {{play of the}} second half, quarterback Chance Harridge ran up {{the middle of the}} field for a 21-yard gain. The Falcons {{followed}} that first-down play with a series of rushes that resulted in another first down, this time in Virginia Tech territory. But as the Hokies had <b>done</b> <b>before</b> them, the Falcons faltered inside opposition territory. Instead of punting the ball, however, Air Force head coach Fisher DeBerry kept his offense on the field to attempt to gain the needed twoyards on fourth down. The attempt was unsuccessful, and Tech's offense returned to the field with 7:40 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
