The analysis focuses first on the impacts in terms of tourism consumption, investments of the sector and public budget. Thereafter, {{by means of a}} multiregional-multisectoral input-output model, the increase on the total employment levels by sector and by region has been estimated. Based on a tourism demand elasticity of - 1. 06 and a supply elasticity of 2. 0, tourist nights would increase by a maximum of 3. 15 % and total tourism consumption by 4. 4 %, while gross fixed investments by the sector would increase by 2. 17 %. As for the budget constraint, we have calculated the final 'cost' of the <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> for the Treasury.

The aggregate approach {{rests on the}} use of the structural vector autoregression model (SVAR) and its extension, the global vector autoregression model (GVAR). The discretionary fiscal impulse itself is then defined as a change in cyclically adjusted balance of the government sector, calculated at quarterly frequencies.

It was found that cross-border effects of discretionary fiscal policies may be indeed present, in case certain conditions are met. Importantly, a fiscal impulse has to originate from a sufficiently large economy and there needs to be a tight trade linkage between examined countries. In most cases, cross-border effects have also been found of lesser magnitude than direct impacts of fiscal policies on the domestic country. Finally, as demonstrated on the German-Czech case, even a single <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> can trigger substantial cross-border spillovers.

Models can, more easily than empirical studies, account for differences between fiscal instruments, for differences between structural characteristics of the economy, and for monetary-fiscal policy interactions.

(iii) Fiscal policy is most effective if it has some persistence and if monetary policy accommodates it.

40|$|Taxation of incomes {{generated}} by economic agents is a main pillar of redistributive social policies {{undertaken by the}} government in Germany. The apparent lack of sufficient adjustments of the tax schedule during the period 2005 - 2015 has led to higher average annual growth rates in taxes than in income. This development has triggered a public dispute about alleged bracket creep, i. e. inflationary-caused nominal income increase pushing taxable income into higher tax bracket, which apparently poses higher tax burden especially among households with small and medium incomes. The aim of this paper is an analysis of the effects of a permanent proportional income tax reduction on the total economy {{as well as on the}} income situation of different household types, against the background of repeated public demands for tax reliefs resulting from increased tax burdens in recent years. The taxation scenario is not calculated on a microeconomic level but uses a macro-econometric approach instead, in order to give a broad overview over a wide variety of effects. By combining the macro-econometric input-output model INFORGE with the socio-economic system DEMOS containing household-specific income and consumption information we can assess how a simple <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure</b> would affect the economy, different household types, and inequality. It can be shown that a tax reduction has a positive aggregate effect throughout the economy in all years of the tax reform. Working households with high incomes profit most from simple tax cuts. Non-working households, however, are faced with comparably smaller positive deviations in income, which exacerbates the projected distance between household incomes and contributes to further increasing inequality...|$|E

To date, the AAS 31 framework has enjoyed primacy. This paper evaluates these two frameworks, and suggests that GFS is superior. Accrual accounting has been accompanied at the national government level {{by the introduction of}} a new key fiscal policy measure: the ‘fiscal balance’. This paper explains and evaluates this new <b>fiscal</b> <b>measure.</b> It concludes that, given the present fiscal policy of the Australian government, fiscal balance is a superior fiscal policy measure to the 'cash ' budget balance measure which it replaced. However, from the alternative ‘golden rule ’ policy standpoint, fiscal balance is not a 1 meaningful fiscal policy measure⎯although its stock counterpart, net financial liabilities, is. 1. The Move to Accrual Accounting Over recent years, Australian Governments have progressively implemented accrual accounting in their general government (ie budget) sectors 1, replacing the traditional 'cash' accounting system which is still used by most governments around the world. This process culminated with the presentation of the annual government budget on a full accrual basis, a step which took place at the Commonwealth government level and in most of the States in 1999 - 2000. The adoption of accrual accounting in the Australian public sector has been complicated by the simultaneous use by governments of two significantly different accrual accounting frameworks. The dominant framework is that derived from Australian Accounting Standard (AAS) 31. The other is the Government Finance Statistics (GFS) framework developed by the Australian Bureau of Statistics ' (ABS). The GFS accrual framework is a reformulation in accrual concepts of a statistical series which prior to 2000 was principally based upon cash accounting concepts.
