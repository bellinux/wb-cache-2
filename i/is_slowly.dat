5|$|According to the {{procedure}} {{described in the}} 1975 Aron patent, and the Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.|$|E
5|$|At {{standard}} temperature and pressure, thorium <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> attacked by water, {{but does not}} readily dissolve in most common acids, {{with the exception of}} hydrochloric acid, where it dissolves leaving a black insoluble residue of ThO(OH,Cl)H. It dissolves in concentrated nitric acid containing a small amount of catalytic fluoride or fluorosilicate ions; if these are not present, passivation can occur, as with uranium and plutonium.|$|E

5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the digestive tract. When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> released.|$|E
5|$|The company {{hopes to}} expand its African operations, where it is already the {{regional}} leader among US fast food chains. The company <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> expanding across the African continent, opening 70 outlets, but progress has been hampered by sourcing issues, such {{as a lack of}} quality suppliers.|$|E

5|$|As of {{the year}} 2000, about 15% of United States {{consumption}} of germanium was used for infrared optics technology and 50% for fiber-optics. Over the past 20 years, infrared use has consistently decreased; fiber optic demand, however, <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> increasing. In America, 30–50% of current fiber optic lines are unused dark fiber, sparking discussion of over-production and a future reduction in demand. Worldwide, demand is increasing dramatically as countries such as China are installing fiber optic telecommunication lines throughout the country.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> subsiding. Some areas already flood regularly at high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E
5|$|Carroon, gravely ill, is {{cared for}} by the Rocket Group's doctor, Briscoe (John Glen), who has been having a secret affair with Carroon's wife, Judith (Isabel Dean). It is not just Quatermass who is {{interested}} in what happened to Carroon and his crewmates; journalists such as James Fullalove (Paul Whitsun-Jones) and Scotland Yard's Inspector Lomax (Ian Colin) are also keen to hear his story. Carroon is abducted {{by a group of}} foreign agents whose government wants the information they believe he has obtained about travelling in space. It is clear that there is something critically wrong: he appears to have absorbed the consciousness of the other two crew members, and <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> mutating into a plant-like alien organism.|$|E

5|$|Geothermal {{power is}} {{considered}} to be renewable because any projected heat extraction is small compared to the Earth's heat content. The Earth has an internal heat content of 1031joules (3·1015TW·hr), approximately 100 billion times current (2010) worldwide annual energy consumption. About 20% of this is residual heat from planetary accretion, and the remainder is attributed to higher radioactive decay rates that existed in the past. Natural heat flows are not in equilibrium, and the planet <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> cooling down on geologic timescales. Human extraction taps a minute fraction of the natural outflow, often without accelerating it.|$|E
5|$|Germanium is a shiny grey-white solid. It has a {{density of}} 5.323 g/cm3 and is hard and brittle. It is mostly unreactive at room {{temperature}} but <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> attacked by hot concentrated sulfuric or nitric acid. Germanium also reacts with molten caustic soda to yield sodium germanate Na2GeO3 and hydrogen gas. It melts at 938°C. Germanium is a semiconductor with an electrical conductivity of around 2 × 10−2S•cm−1 and a band gap of 0.67eV. Liquid germanium is a metallic conductor, with an electrical conductivity {{similar to that of}} liquid mercury.|$|E
5|$|Lead's per-particle {{abundance}} in the Solar System is 0.121 ppb (parts per billion). This figure is {{two and a}} half times higher than that of platinum, eight times more than mercury, and seventeen times more than gold. The amount of lead in the universe <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> increasing as most heavier atoms (all of which are unstable) gradually decay to lead. The abundance of lead in the Solar System since its formation 4.5 billion years ago has increased by about 0.75%. The solar system abundances table shows that lead, despite its relatively high atomic number, is more prevalent than most other elements with atomic numbers greater than 40.|$|E

5|$|Nickel <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> {{oxidized}} by air at {{room temperature}} and is considered corrosion-resistant. Historically, {{it has been used}} for plating iron and brass, coating chemistry equipment, and manufacturing certain alloys that retain a high silvery polish, such as German silver. About 9% of world nickel production is still used for corrosion-resistant nickel plating. Nickel-plated objects sometimes provoke nickel allergy. Nickel has been widely used in coins, though its rising price has led to some replacement with cheaper metals in recent years.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{invasive}} plants live {{along the}} Saw Mill River. Porcelain berry is a vine with white berries that wraps around native trees and strangles them. Oriental bittersweet is also present along the river, and it <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> displacing the native American bittersweet. Oriental bitterweet can also form hybrids with the native bittersweet and making identification harder. Japanese honeysuckle and Japanese knotweed {{are two other}} invasive vines native to Asia. In addition, purple loosestrife, a perennial herb with magenta flower stalks, is also present along the river.|$|E
5|$|Patricia's secret <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> {{revealed}} to the other characters. Pablo learns her true identity in the series finale, and they stay together. Andrés and Maria Laura leave the city; Victoria has a son with Tuca; Elías and Dana open a knish shop and Gabriela marries her neighbor, Marito (Alan Sabbagh). The series ends with a party hosted by the school for the 1989 graduates, similar to the graduation party in the first episode.|$|E

5|$|The IUCN Red List {{does not}} {{distinguish}} the hooded crow from the carrion crow, {{but the two}} species together have an extensive range, estimated at 10millionkm2 (3.8million mi2), and a large population, including an estimated 14 to 34 million individuals in Europe alone. They are not believed to approach the thresholds for the population decline criterion of the IUCN Red List (i.e., declining more than 30% in ten years or three generations), so are evaluated as Least Concern. The carrion crow/hooded crow hybrid zone <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> spreading northwest, but the hooded crow has {{on the order of}} three million territories in just Europe (excluding Russia).|$|E
5|$|The cluster <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> {{moving in}} the {{direction}} of the feet of what is currently the constellation of Orion. Like most open clusters, the Pleiades will not stay gravitationally bound forever. Some component stars will be ejected after close encounters with other stars; others will be stripped by tidal gravitational fields. Calculations suggest that the cluster will take about 250 million years to disperse, with gravitational interactions with giant molecular clouds and the spiral arms of our galaxy also hastening its demise.|$|E
5|$|The eighth {{season of}} The Office largely {{centers around the}} antics of the new Sabre CEO, Robert California. Initially, he appears calm, collected, and calculating. However, as the season progresses, it becomes obvious that his {{management}} style <b>is</b> <b>slowly</b> destroying the company. Dwight—along with Jim, Stanley, Ryan, Erin, and Cathy (Lindsay Broad)—travel to Florida to help set up a Sabre Store, where Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate) is introduced. Eventually, former CFO of Dunder Mifflin David Wallace buys back the company, firing California.|$|E
