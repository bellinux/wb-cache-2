However, applying a large permanent biaxial strain to germanium has been a challenge.

Our technique works by concentrating and amplifying a pre-existing small strain into the microdisk region. Biaxial strains as large as 1. 11 % are observed by Raman spectroscopy and are further confirmed by photoluminescence measurements, which show enhanced and redshifted light emission from the strained microdisks. Our technique allows the amount of biaxial strain to be customized lithographically, allowing the bandgaps of different microdisks to be independently tuned in a single mask process.

With a plurality of interconnect technologies to include electronics, photonics, plasmonics, and hybrids thereof, the simple approach of counting on-chip devices to capture performance is insufficient. While some efforts have been made to capture the performance evolution more accurately, they eventually deviate from the observed development pace. Thus, a holistic figure of merit (FOM) is needed to adequately compare these recent technology paradigms.

As such CLEAR incorporates communication delay, energy efficiency, on-chip scaling and economic cost. We show that CLEAR accurately describes compute development including most recent machines. Since this FOM is derived bottom-up, we demonstrate remarkable adaptability to applications ranging from device-level to network and system-level. Applying CLEAR to benchmark device, link, and network performance against fundamental physical compute and communication limits shows that photonics is competitive even for fractions of the die-size, thus making a case for on-chip optical <b>interconnects.</b> Comment: 10 <b>page...</b>|$|R

Growing bandwidth demand in hyper-scale data centers and high-performance computing motivates the development of faster and more-efficient silicon photonics links.

40|$|Electron {{acceleration}} to non-thermal, ultra-relativistic energies (10 - 100 TeV) {{is revealed}} by radio and X-ray observations of shocks in young supernova remnants (SNRs). The diffusive shock acceleration (DSA) mechanism is usually invoked {{to explain this}} acceleration, but {{the way in which}} electrons are initially energized or 'injected' into this acceleration process starting from thermal energies is an unresolved problem. In this paper we study the initial acceleration of electrons in non-relativistic shocks from first principles, using two- and three-dimensional particle-in-cell (PIC) plasma simulations. We systematically explore the space of shock parameters (the Alfvénic Mach number, M_A, the shock velocity, v_sh, the angle between the upstream magnetic field and the shock normal, theta_Bn, and the ion to electron mass ratio, m_i/m_e). We find that significant non-thermal acceleration occurs due to the growth of oblique whistler waves in the foot of quasi-perpendicular shocks. The obtained electron energy distributions show power law tails with spectral indices up to alpha 3 - 4. The maximum energies of the accelerated particles are consistent with the electron Larmor radii being comparable to that of the ions, indicating potential injection into the subsequent DSA process. This injection mechanism, however, requires the shock waves to have fairly low Alfénic Mach numbers, M_A < 20, which is consistent with the theoretical conditions for the growth of whistler waves in the shock foot (M_A < (m_i/m_e) ^ 1 / 2). Thus, if the whistler mechanism is the only robust electron injection process at work in SNR shocks, then SNRs that display non-thermal emission must have significantly amplified upstream magnetic fields. Such field amplification is likely achieved by the escaping cosmic rays, so electron and proton acceleration in SNR shocks must be <b>interconnected.</b> Comment: 15 <b>pages,</b> 15 figures, Re-submission of version accepted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|In atomic {{multi-level}} systems, adiabatic elimination is {{a method}} used to minimize complicity of the system by eliminating irrelevant and strongly coupled levels by detuning them from one-another. Such a three-level system, for instance, can be mapped onto physical in form of a three-waveguide system. Actively detuning the coupling strength between the respective waveguide modes allows modulating light propagating through the device, as proposed here. The outer waveguides act as an effective two- photonic-mode system similar to ground- and excited states of a three-level atomic system, whilst the center waveguide is partially plasmonic. In adiabatic elimination regime, the amplitude of the middle waveguide oscillates much faster {{in comparison to the}} outer waveguides leading to a vanishing field build up. As a result, the middle waveguide becomes a dark state and hence a low insertion-loss of 8 decibel is expected to keep when achieving the modulation depth as high as 70 decibel despite the involvement of a plasmonic waveguide in the design presented here. The modulation mechanism relies on switching this waveguide system from a critical coupling regime to adiabatic elimination condition via electrostatically tuning the free-carrier concentration and hence the optical index of a thin ITO layer residing in the plasmonic center waveguide. This alters the effective coupling length and the phase mismatching condition thus modulation in each of outer waveguides. Our results show a modulator energy efficiency as low as 40 atto-joule per bit and an extinction ratio of 50 decibel. Given the minuscule footprint of the modulator, the resulting lumped-element limited RC delay is expected to exceed 200 giga hertz.

Sobelman. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xi, 79 <b>pages.</b> <b>Interconnect</b> design and signaling methods {{play an important}} role in modern VLSI systems by providing a communication medium between distant points having low latency, small energy consumption and robustness against noise. An important figure of merit for monolithic buses is power consumption, which is a function of bus topology, technology parameters and the signaling methods used. It has been reported in the literature that buses may consume more than half of the total power budget of a chip. This thesis develops a set of signaling methods and coding techniques to ameliorate this power problem. A multilevel signaling scheme is chosen in which more than two voltage values are used to represent the transmitted data. This approach incorporates both bus multiplexing and reduced voltage swings to achieve the low-power goal. A comprehensive analysis of energy consumption for voltage-mode, multilevel signals on a nanometer technology bus is presented. An accurate, transition-dependent model for multilevel buses is proposed which allows simplified calculation of the bus energy consumption. This energy model is then applied, together with physical optimization of the on-chip interconnect structure, to achieve highly energy-efficient on-chip bus communication. The results show that significant energy savings can be achieved compared to traditional binary signaling methods. Next, a novel technique called Bus Transform coding for multilevel signals is proposed, which is an extension of the traditional Bus-Invert coding of binary signals. Simulation results show that this technique can achieve reductions in the average power consumption compared to an uncoded multilevel bus. Finally, this thesis shows, through the use of trellis diagrams and the Viterbi algorithm, that Bus-Invert coding is optimal for a sequence of data values transmitted over a binary bus...|$|R
40|$|Relatively short peptides, such as toxins and antimicrobial-peptides, {{are known}} to insert {{themselves}} into cell membranes. On the basis of simple bead-spring models for the membrane lipids, the peptide, and water, detailed processes of the peptide insertion is investigated by molecular dynamics simulation; our special concern is in the highly cooperative motions of membrane lipids and the peptide. Our model lipid has a head group of three hydrophilic beads and a tail of seven hydrophobic beads, while the model peptide is a block-copolymer made of hydrophilic and hydrophobic blocks, with total length of 200 beads. In addition, each water molecule is represented by a single bead which has considerably larger interaction energy. We first confirm that our present lipid model can support spontaneous formation of bilayers in water. Then we place the model peptide near the bilayers and monitor the microscopic process of the adsorption, insertion, and translocation of the peptide. When the peptide molecule is set free {{to interact with the}} membrane, the hydrophobic blocks of the peptide strongly favor intimate contact with the lipid tails. This strong attractive interaction gives rise to a severe membrane perturbation, which leads to the formation of a pore, though short-lived, in the membrane. It is found that the side-surface of the pore is almost covered with the hydrophilic heads of the lipids, which seems to help the hydrophilic blocks of the peptide translocate across the membrane. We also monitor the rate of flip-flop inversion of the directions of lipids, and we find it markedly increases during the peptide contact and insertion. The peptide insertion/translocation, the formation of membrane pore, and the flip-flop motions of the lipids are thus found to be closely <b>interconnected.</b> Comment: 8 <b>page...</b>|$|R
