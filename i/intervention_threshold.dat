40|$|The {{clinical}} significance of osteoporosis {{lies in the}} fractures that arise, but the diagnosis of osteoporosis relies on the quantitative assessment of bone mineral density. There {{are a number of}} other indications for bone densitometry including monitoring of treatment, determining the extent of bone loss and assessment of suitability for certain treatments. Most commonly, bone density is used to determine eligibility for treatment. However, diagnostic <b>thresholds</b> differ from <b>intervention</b> <b>thresholds</b> for several reasons. Firstly, the fracture risk varies at different ages, even with the same T-score. Other factors that determine <b>intervention</b> <b>thresholds</b> include the presence of clinical risk factors such as a prior fracture, a family history of hip fracture, smoking and high alcohol consumption and secondary causes of osteoporosis. Algorithms that integrate the weight of clinical risk factors for fracture risk have been developed by the World Health Organization.

This can be estimated each week by noting the trend {{of the population of}} adults with the use of traps for monitoring or detecting the number of active infestation (bites and fertile mine of larvae I and II age). To be reliable, the system first requires a suitable response in the trial, because the intervention thresholds vary {{depending on the type of}} trap and the environment. In northern Sardinia, an <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold</b> - for cultivars of oil - was reliably evaluated, with a weekly catch of 10 adults per sticky trap in summer and 30 adults per trap in October. Further reliable information used is the sampling of olives to estimate the extent of infestation. In this case, the threshold for intervention of an active infestation is recommended between 10-15% on cultivars for oil production and 5% for table cultivars. Sampling is carried out weekly and taken randomly over a large area for an olive tree at head height. A sample is separated from samples of 100-200 olives, which are to detect the presence of live and uninfected eggs and larvae at first and second stages. The presence of eclosions, larvae and pupal third stages should not be counted because the damage has already occurred and the treatment would be worthless.|$|E

We present a new approach for mapping the prevalence of STH in Kenya, incorporating observed prevalence data from 945 cross-sectional surveys undertaken between 1974 and 2009. The distribution of each species was modelled using model-based geostatistics; models included information on environmental factors, the spatial distribution of existing surveys and when these surveys were conducted. Resulting risk maps were combined and linked with population data enabling estimation of the population at risk of any STH infection and requiring treatment in 2009. In most areas, there was high certainty that combined STH prevalence was below the 20 % <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold,</b> with areas of high prevalence located around the shores of Lake Victoria and on the coast. Results also suggest that observed prevalence decreased over time and emphasise the importance of continued surveillance in areas where observed prevalence was historically high.

40|$|Abstract The {{diagnosis}} of osteoporosis {{is based on}} the measurement of bone mineral density (BMD). There are a number of clinical risk factors that provide informa-tion on fracture risk over and above that given by BMD. The assessment of fracture risk thus needs to be distin-guished from diagnosis to take account of the indepen-dent value of the clinical risk factors. These include age, a prior fragility fracture, a parental history of hip frac-ture, smoking, use of systemic corticosteroids, excess alcohol intake and rheumatoid arthritis. The indepen-dent contribution of these risk factors can be integrated by the calculation of fracture probability with or with-out the use of BMD. Treatment can then be offered to those identified to have a fracture probability greater than an <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold...</b>|$|E
30|$|Despite {{the fact}} that a low BMD is still the basis for the {{definition}} of osteoporosis and the main risk factor for fragility fractures, it should not be considered alone when defining the overall risk for fracture and the single <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold.</b> The limitations of assessing bone quantity with the BMD have been discussed previously. For a given T-score, age increases the risk for fracture [75]. Moreover, while the risk for fracture varies markedly among countries, the T-score differs only minimally. Therefore, other factors may modulate fracture risk. Specific algorithms such as the Garvan calculator [78], the QFracture [79], and FRAX® [80], which incorporate several risk factors in addition to age (as described above), have been developed to better define the risk for fracture and the consequent <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold.</b> Among these tools, the FRAX® tool [81] has been the most extensively employed and validated in postmenopausal osteoporosis and in the other main types of osteoporosis. FRAX® is a computer-based calculation tool that calculates the individual 10 -year probability of major osteoporotic fractures (namely at the hip, humerus, wrist, and overt vertebral fractures) and hip fractures. It takes into account major risk factors such as age, sex, body mass index, history of fractures, previous fragility fractures, parental history of hip fractures, present tobacco smoking, previous or current long-term oral glucocorticoids, rheumatoid arthritis, secondary osteoporosis, and alcohol abuse as dichotomous variables, and includes mortality as a competing risk. Femoral neck BMD can be added, where available, to increase the sensitivity of the algorithm for predicting the risk of fractures. The calculation is available and tailored for different regions of the world as it utilizes country-specific epidemiological data on fracture and death [82, 83].|$|E
40|$|Physicians {{can assess}} the risk of {{fracture}} based on bone density (BMD) and several risk factors. Some of them and BMD are incorporated into FRAX, an assessment tool that estimates the 10 -years probability of fracture. BMD didn't {{take into account the}} microarchitecture. TBS is a texture parameter related to bone microarchitecture. A low TBS is associated with a history of fracture and the incidence of new fracture independently of BMD, clinical risk factors and FRAX. TBS is yet integrated in the FRAX tool, and this effect is of greatest utility for individuals who are close to an <b>intervention</b> <b>threshold.</b> It is particularly useful for the evaluation of secondary osteoporosis, including type 2 diabetes, Gluco-corticoïd induced osteoporosis.

40|$|Purpose of review: In the 8 {{years since}} {{the launch of the}} FRAX tool, it has {{continued}} to grow with the addition of new country or territory models. Although the core of the fracture risk algorithm remains unchanged, there is growing evidence of possible additional independent clinical variables that might modulate the interpretation of the FRAX outputs. There is also an expanding number of international guidelines that incorporate FRAX assessments, leading to discussions on the use of FRAX in treated patients and the determination of <b>intervention</b> <b>thresholds.</b> Recent findings: This review encompasses recent information on the use of FRAX in immigrant populations and the potential influence of skeletal and extraskeletal risk factors on FRAX estimations. For example, trabecular bone score and falls risk appear to be promising additional factors in individual risk assessment. FRAX appears to remain accurate in those on osteoporosis treatments, but FRAX is not a suitable tool for use in treat-to-target strategies. Summary: The assessment of fracture risk in immigrants is probably more accurate {{with the use of the}} FRAX tool for the country of origin, if available.
