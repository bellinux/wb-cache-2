5000|$|Although {{nowhere near}} as {{successful}} as the Pratt & Whitney JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a very advanced engine for its time (late 50's). Like the JT3D, the CJ805-23 was a turbofan derived from a turbojet. General Electric's approach {{was to take the}} single spool CJ805-3 turbojet and incorporate an aft fan/turbine system into the exhaust system. Each turbine blade {{was an integral part of}} a blucket, the outboard section of which was a <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade.</b> Running freely on a stub shaft, a series of bluckets, mounted on a disc, made up the aft rotor assembly. The efflux from the turbojet expanded through the (inner) turbine annulus. thus providing power directly to the fan blades located in the outer annulus. A full-length cowl, an annular exhaust system and a bucket thrust-reverser were fitted for the Convair 990. A relatively short fan cowl and thrust reverser [...] was used to demonstrate the engine on the Sud Aviation Caravelle. The CJ805-23, if chosen, would have replaced the Rolls-Royce Avon. Rolls-Royce quickly built and tested an aft-fan demonstrator Avon to compete with the greater thrust and lower sfc of the CJ805-23. In the end the Caravelle was re-engined with the P&W JT8D turbofan.|$|E

40|$|Various new {{technologies}} currently under development may enable controlled blade shape variability, or so-called blade morphing, to be practically employed in aircraft engine fans and compressors {{in the foreseeable}} future. The current study is a relatively brief, preliminary computational fluid dynamics investigation aimed at partially demonstrating and quantifying the aerodynamic potential of <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> morphing. The investigation is intended to provide information useful for near-term planning, as well as aerodynamic solution data sets that can be subsequently analyzed using advanced acoustic diagnostic tools, {{for the purpose of}} making fan noise comparisons. Two existing fan system models serve as baselines for the investigation: the Advanced Ducted Propulsor fan with a design tip speed of 806 ft/sec and a pressure ratio of 1. 294, and the Source Diagnostic Test fan with a design tip speed of 1215 ft/sec and a pressure ratio of 1. 470. Both are 22 -in. sub-scale, low-noise research fan/nacelle models that have undergone extensive experimental testing in the 9 - by 15 -foot Low Speed Wind Tunnel at the NASA Glenn Research Center. The study, restricted to <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> morphing only, involves a fairly simple blade morphing technique. Specifically, spanwise-linear variations in rotor blade-section setting angle are applied to alter the blade shape; that is, the blade is linearly retwisted from hub to tip. Aerodynamic performance comparisons are made between morphed-blade and corresponding baseline configurations on the basis of equal fan system thrust, where rotor rotational speed for the morphed-blade fan is varied to change the thrust level for that configuration. The results of the investigation confirm that rotor blade morphing could be a useful technology, with the potential to enable significant improvements in fan aerodynamic performance. Even though the study is very limited in scope and confined to simple geometric perturbations of two existing fan systems, the aerodynamic effectiveness of blade morphing is demonstrated by the configurations analyzed. In particular, for the Advanced Ducted Propulsor fan it is demonstrated that the performance levels of the original variable-pitch baseline design can be achieved using blade morphing instead of variable pitch, and for the Source Diagnostic Test fan the performance at important off-design operating points is substantially increased with blade morphing...|$|E
40|$|The TURBO-AE {{aeroelastic}} code {{has been}} used to verify the flutter stability of the trailing edge blowing (TEB) fan, which is a unique technology demonstrator being designed and fabricated at the NASA Glenn Research Center for testing in Glenn s 9 - by 15 -Foot Low-Speed Wind Tunnel. Air can be blown out of slots near the trailing edges of the TEB fan blades to fill in the wakes downstream of the rotating blades, which reduces the rotor-stator interaction (tone) noise caused by the interaction of wakes with the downstream stators. The TEB fan will demonstrate a 1. 6 -EPNdB reduction in tone noise through wake filling. Furthermore, the reduced blade-row interaction will decrease the possibility of forced-response vibrations and enable closer spacing of blade rows, thus reducing engine length and weight. The detailed aeroelastic analysis capability of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes TURBO-AE code was used to check the TEB <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> for flutter stability.

The transient response curves of the points corresponding to measured points in experiments, displacements and equivalent stresses on the blades are obtained during the simulation. From the comparison of the transient response curves obtained from numerical simulation with that obtained from experiments, it can be found that the variations in measured points and the corresponding points of simulation are basically the same.

40|$|Increased {{emphasis}} on sustained supersonic or hypersonic cruise has revived {{interest in the}} supersonic throughflow fan as a possible component in advanced propulsion systems. Use of a fan that can operate with a supersonic inlet axial Mach number is attractive {{from the standpoint of}} reducing the inlet losses incurred in diffusing the flow from a supersonic flight Mach number to a subsonic one at the fan face. The design of the experiment using advanced computational codes to calculate the components required is described. The rotor was designed using existing turbomachinery design and analysis codes modified to handle fully supersonic axial flow through the rotor. A two-dimensional axisymmetric throughflow design code plus a blade element code were used to generate fan rotor velocity diagrams and blade shapes. A quasi-three-dimensional, thin shear layer Navier-Stokes code was used to assess the performance of the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blade</b> shapes.

The other <b>fan</b> had 9 <b>rotor</b> <b>blades,</b> 13 stator blades, and a maximum speed of 2, 000 rpm.

40|$|The {{flow path}} {{close to the}} suction side of <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades</b> mostly-affects the overall drag of the blading. The blade lift is {{affected}} as well because {{of the separation of}} the low energy boundary layer that drives the blade into stall at low fan flow rates. Forward sweep allows to position the airfoil sections of blades featuring a positive circulation gradient along the span so that they "accompany" the near-wall flow trajectories at the blade suction side. So, rotor efficiency and stall margin of the fan can be improved. On the other hand, blade end effects play a relevant role in high hub-to-tip and low aspect ratio rotors and may compromise the effectiveness of forward sweep. Nevertheless, some authors in the literature stated the beneficial contribution of changing the sweep angle at the ends of the blade both at design and off-design conditions. The paper studies the end effects on constant-swirl design rotors by means of CFD simulations focusing on the distribution of blade sweep in the near-tip region. In particular, the performance and efficiency calculated for a forward swept tube-axial fan featuring a hub-to-tip ratio equal to 0. 4 are compared with those estimated for the corresponding unswept fan at equal duty point. Several modifications of the sweep distribution in the blade tip region are considered in the swept fan to quantify their effect on performance, efficiency and stall margin. Results show that the addition of up to 6 degrees of local forward sweep at the blade tip to the unswept blading does not affect fan pressure at design operation. On the other hand, this local increase of the sweep angle allows for a very notable increase of the peak pressure and efficiency at flow rates close to stall inception...|$|R
50|$|One SST VCE {{concept is}} the Tandem Fan engine. The engine has two fans, both {{mounted on the}} {{low-pressure}} shaft, with a significant axial gap between the units. In normal flight, the engine is in the series mode, with the flow leaving the front fan passing directly into the second fan, the engine behaving much like a normal turbofan. However, for take-off, climb-out, final-descent and approach, the front fan is allowed to discharge directly through an auxiliary nozzle {{on the underside of}} the powerplant nacelle. Auxiliary intakes are opened on each side of the powerplant, allowing air to enter the rear fan and progress through the rest of the engine. Operating the fans in this parallel mode substantially increases the total airflow of the engine at a thrust, resulting in a lower jet velocity and a quieter engine. Back in the 1970s, Boeing modified a Pratt & Whitney JT8D to a Tandem Fan configuration and successfully demonstrated the switch from series to parallel operation (and vice versa) with the engine running, albeit at part power. In the Mid Tandem Fan concept, a high specific flow single stage fan is located between the high pressure (HP) and low pressure (LP) compressors of a turbojet core. Only bypass air is allowed to pass through the fan, the LP compressor exit flow passing through special passages within the fan disc, directly underneath the <b>fan</b> <b>rotor</b> <b>blades.</b> Some of the bypass air enters the engine via an auxiliary intake. During take-off and approach the engine behaves much like a normal civil turbofan, with an acceptable jet noise level (i.e., low specific thrust). However, for supersonic cruise, the fan variable inlet guide vanes and auxiliary intake close-off to minimize bypass flow and increase specific thrust. In this mode the engine acts more like a 'leaky' turbojet (e.g. the F404).|$|R
