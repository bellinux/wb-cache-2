40|$|Abstract — Single–hop WDM {{networks}} with {{a central}} Passive Star Coupler (PSC), as well as single–hop networks {{with a central}} Arrayed–Waveguide Grating (AWG) and a single transceiver at each node, have been extensively studied as solutions for the quickly increasing amounts of unicast and multicast traffic in the metropolitan area. The main bottlenecks of these networks are the lack of spatial wavelength reuse in the studied PSC based networks and the single transceiver in the studied AWG based metro WDM networks. In this paper we develop and evaluate the FT Λ − FR Λ AWG network, {{which is based on}} a central AWG and has arrays of fixed–tuned transmitters and receivers at each node. Transceiver arrays are a mature technology, making the proposed network practical. In addition, the transmitter arrays allow for <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> over the AWG while the receiver arrays relieve the receiver bottleneck arising from multicasting in conjunction with spatial wavelength reuse on the AWG.

40|$|In {{a digital}} X-ray imaging system, data {{has to be}} {{transmitted}} from the detector to the storage system. In future digital X-ray imaging systems, higher data rates will be needed. For some applications, e. g. protein crystallography at synchrotron beams, data rates {{in the order of}} gigabits per second are expected. Present trend for such systems is to move from a parallel data bus towards a high-speed serial readout. For <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> over short distances (up to 10 m) the attenuation of copper cables is low enough to permit multi-gigabit per second speeds. In this article, an overview will be given of problems encountered in high speed data transmission over copper cable and techniques will be shown to overcome these problems. The bandwidth bottleneck in short distance communication is in the IC-technology and not in the channel. The cable transfer function results in inter-symbol interference (ISI). The skin-effect is the most significant cause of ISI for short length (10 m) coaxial copper cables. Fortunately, equalization can compensate for these effects. An equalizer has a transfer function that is the inverse of the channel transfer function. With the correct equalizer, a very low Bit Error Ratio (BER) can be achieved. The measured RG- 58 U cable (¿ 1 = 0. 12 ns) could transmit at a bit rate of 8. 3 Gbps, with a BER of 10 ¿ 12. Multi-gigabit speeds are possible over short length coaxial copper cables...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of many digital systems today {{is limited by}} the interconnection bandwidth between chips. Although the processing {{performance of}} a single chip has increased dramatically since the inception of the integrated circuit technology, the communication bandwidth between chips has not enjoyed as much benefit. Most CMOS chips, when communicating off-chip, drive unterminated lines with full-swing CMOS drivers. Such full-swing CMOS interconnect ring-up the line, and hence has a bandwidth that {{is limited by the}} length of the line rather than the performance of the semiconductor technology. Thus, as VLSI technology scales, the pin bandwidth does not improve with the technology, but rather remains limited by board and cable geometry, making off-chip bandwidth an even more critical bottleneck. In order to increase the I/O Bandwidth, some efficient <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> standard must be used which considers the line termination, signal integrity, power dissipation, noise immunity etc In this work, a transmitter has been developed for high speed offchip communication. It consists of low speed input buffer, serializer which converts parallel input data into serial data and a current mode driver which converts the voltage mode input signals into current over the transmission line. Output of 32 low speed input buffers is fed to two serializer, each serializer converting 16 bit parallel data into serial data stream. Output of two serializers is fed to LVDS current mode driver. The serial link technique used in this work is the time division multiplex (TDM) and point-to-point technique. It means that the low-speed parallel signals are transferred to the high-speed serial signal at the transmitter end and the high-speed serial signal is transferred to the low-speed parallel signals at the receiver end. Serial link is the design of choice in any application where the cost of the communication channel is high and duplicating the links in large numbers is uneconomical...|$|E

40|$|As {{technology}} scales, interconnect planning {{has been}} widely {{regarded as one of}} the most critical factors in determining the system performance and total power consumption. As the result of shrinking dimension, on-chip wires are getting more resistive, and the delay is becoming larger comparing to gate delay. On the other hand, the self capacitance of wires does not scale with feature size, and as wiring density grows, the total coupling capacitance increases, which results in substantial increment of interconnect power consumption. Meanwhile, off-chip interconnect is also becoming a limiting factor for system performance since the growth of chip's I/O bandwidth has been outpaced by the growth of communication. To meet the performance challenge, the per- pin interconnect bandwidth must be further improved with given power budget. For on-chip interconnect, buffer insertion has been adopted to reduce the signal delay. However, the added buffers require extra power consumption and increase routing complexity. In this dissertation, we investigate a set of interconnect performance metrics, optimize the repeated on-chip wires under different design goals and compare the performance metrics of optimum results. The quantitative delay-energy trade-offs for different design goals are demonstrated. Even with repeaters, nominal on-chip global wires still can not keep up with the pace of gate scaling. We propose a <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> scheme using transmission line properties to address the performance issue. The transmission line allows the signal to travel at the speed of light in the medium. The signal toggles as wave instead of enforced electronic charges and thus saves power. However, the inter-symbol interference (ISI) limits the communication bandwidth. We use passive compensation to alleviate the ISI and develop an optimization flow for a given technology and wire dimension. We compare the nominal repeated wires with the transmission lines under different design goals. For off-chip serial links, we propose a set of passive equalization schemes to enhance the performance with low power consumption. We apply the schemes to the CPU-memory links using IBM POWER 6 system as a test vehicle. An optimization flow is devised to optimize the parameters of the equalizers. We derive the performance improvement and power consumption of the proposed schemes. We also demonstrate the sensitivities to the variations of RLC parameters and nois...|$|E
40|$|With {{the steady}} {{progress}} of high performance electronic systems, {{the complexity of}} the electronic systems grows continuously and new features like high-speed, low power and low cost, become the key issues. The interconnection in the electronic systems distributes the power, clock and transfers the electrical signals among numerous components. As the feature size of microelectronic technology becomes smaller, the design and analysis of the interconnection are more important for the performance and cost of the system. The escape routing design is a new important problem in the interconnection design because the number of chip/package input/output (I/O) pins has continuously been growing for high-speed high-performance system. The traditional escape routing strategy and several improvements, pins/pads special placement and routing resource exploration, could not handle large number of I/Os efficiently and usually require increased cost. We introduce a novel concept, escape sequence, develop efficient escape routing strategies based on the new concept and model the escaping wires using 3 D extraction. For square grid array, we formulate and solve a maximum flow problem to analyze the escape bottleneck in area array. The layer count can be decreased dramatically by optimizing the I/O escape sequence. Two new escape routing strategies, central triangular escape routing and two-sided escape routing, are proposed and the number of escape routing layers could be reduced dramatically. We implement an automatic escape routing program to verify our analysis and to compare different escape sequence strategies. The escaping wires could be modeled as frequency dependent RLGC circuit for signal performance analysis. For hexagonal area array, we analyze its preponderant properties that the hexagonal array could increase the density of I/Os in the array remarkably. We propose three escape routing strategies for the hexagonal array: column-by-column horizontal escape routing, two- sided horizontal/vertical escape routing, and multi- direction hybrid channel escape routing. We can escape I/ Os in the hexagonal array in the same or less number of routing layers compared with square grid array. Therefore, we could reduce the number of escape routing layers as well as increase the density of I/Os. The eye diagram prediction is an important problem in the interconnection analysis because an eye diagram provides the most fundamental and intuitive view to evaluate the signal quality of high-speed communication. The traditional method to obtain the eye diagram involves performing a time domain simulation. It requires a very long simulation time and usually could not accurately characterize the communication systems because the limited length pseudorandom bit sequence (PRBS) as the input stimulus. Several eye diagram prediction methods, analytical techniques, analysis based on unit pulse response and analysis based on step response, have their application constraints because of their assumptions and usually could not handle general systems. We introduce an efficient and accurate method, the accumulative prediction method, to predict the eye diagram for high-speed signaling systems. We use the step response of the signaling system to extract the worst-case eye diagram, including the eye opening and timing jitter. Furthermore, this method generates the input data patterns which produce the worst- case inter-symbol interference. The main advantage is that this general-purpose method can handle signals with asymmetric as well as symmetric rise/fall time. Furthermore, {{the complexity of the}} proposed method is linear O(n), where n is the number of time points of step response. This method can be applied to analyze the signal performance in escape routing. It is very useful to analyze various <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signaling</b> system...|$|E

It {{is necessary to}} monitor the system health continuously to prevent system failure in advance. Solder joints {{in electronic}} assemblies {{are one of the}} major failure sites under thermal, mechanical and chemical stress conditions during their operation. Solder joint degradation usually starts from the surface where <b>high</b> <b>speed</b> <b>signals</b> are concentrated due to the phenomenon referred to as the skin effect.

The objective of the thesis is to assess solder joint degradation in a non-destructive way based on digital signal characterization. For accelerated life testing the stress conditions were designed in order to generate gradual degradation of solder joints. The signal generated by a digital signal transceiver was travelling through the solder joints to continuously monitor the signal integrity under the stress conditions. The signal properities were obtained by eye parameters and jitter, which represented the characteristics of the digital signal in terms of noise and timing error. The eye parameters and jitter exhibited significant increase after the exposure of the solder joints to the stress conditions.
