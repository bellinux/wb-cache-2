5|$|Chaoyangsaurus is {{recovered}} {{in a more}} basal position than Psittacosauridae, although Chinnery's original analysis finds it within Neoceratopsia.

The design of this research using primary data obtained by distributing questionnaires to 250 respondents eligible stayed at the Budget Hotel at least 1 time in last 12 months. Respondents were selected using purposive sampling method and the data were analyzed using AMOS version 22. 0 and SPSS version 22. 0. The proposed model was tested using Structural Equation Modeling (SEM) and analyzed using AMOS. This study shows that 1) Service Quality <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on Customer Satisfaction, 2) Service Quality <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on Customer Loyalty, 3) Customer Satisfaction is <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on Customer Loyalty, 4) Service Quality <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on brand image, 5) Customer Satisfaction is <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on Brand Image, 6) Customer Loyalty <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> influence on the Brand Image. The results of this study concluded that there is a positive influence of the Service Quality on Brand Image through the Customer Satisfaction and Customer Loyalty. Future researches are recommended to increase the factor of First Impression, Favorable Location, Hotel Core Product and Hotel Deals.

5|$|For {{the next}} {{two and a half}} centuries, Io {{remained}} an unresolved, 5th-magnitude point of light in astronomers' telescopes. During the 17th century, Io and the other Galilean satellites served a variety of purposes, including early methods to determine longitude, validating Kepler's third law of planetary motion, and determining the time required for light to travel between Jupiter and Earth. Based on ephemerides produced by astronomer Giovanni Cassini and others, Pierre-Simon Laplace created a mathematical theory to explain the resonant orbits of Io, Europa, and Ganymede.

5|$|Four star {{systems are}} known to harbour planets. HD 330075 is a sunlike star around 164light-years distant that is orbited by a hot Jupiter every 3.4days.

Slightly larger and hotter than the Sun, it was <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> roughly Jupiter-size planet with an orbital period of 2.8 years. HD 143361 is a binary star system composed of a sunlike star and a faint red dwarf separated by 30.9AU. A planet roughly triple the mass of Jupiter orbits the brighter star every 1057± 20days. HD 142415 is approximately 113light-years distant and has a Jupiter-sized planet with an orbital period of around 386 days.|$|E

Marley turned down his doctors' advice to have his toe amputated (which would have hindered his performing career), citing his religious beliefs, and instead the nail and nail bed were removed and a skin graft taken from his thigh to cover the area.

5|$|Operational {{problems}} have been experienced and some have caused fleet-wide groundings. Critically, pilots have experienced a decreased mental status, including losing consciousness. There were reports of instances of pilots <b>found</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> decreased level of alertness or memory loss after landing. F-22 pilots have experienced lingering respiratory problems and a chronic cough; other symptoms include irritability, emotional lability and neurological changes. A number of possible causes were investigated, including possible exposure to noxious chemical agents from the respiratory tubing, pressure suit malfunction, side effects from oxygen delivery at greater-than-atmospheric concentrations, and oxygen supply disruptions. Other problems include minor mechanical problems and navigational software failures. The fleet was grounded for four months in 2011 before resuming flight, but reports of oxygen issues persisted.|$|E

5|$|The lighter {{isotopes}} {{usually have}} shorter half-lives; half-lives of under 100ms for 260Bh, 261Bh, 262Bh, and 262mBh were observed. 264Bh, 265Bh, 266Bh, and 271Bh are more stable at around 1s, and 267Bh and 272Bh have half-lives of about 10s.
