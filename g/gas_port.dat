25|$|The SG 550 is a selective-fire 5.56×45mm NATO {{assault rifle}} firing from a closed bolt. It has a gas-actuated piston-driven {{long-stroke}} operating system {{derived from the}} SIG SG 540 series of rifles, which uses burnt powder gases vented through a port in the barrel to power the weapon's moving parts. Once inside the gas cylinder, propellant gases pass through an L-shaped channel machined in the piston head and are directed forward towards the gas valve. The pressure build-up {{in front of the}} piston head pushes the piston and bolt carrier rearward. As the piston is driven back, the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> and the L-shaped channel move out of alignment, cutting off the supply of gas to the cylinder. Surplus gas and powder residues are evacuated through an exhaust port in the gas cylinder. This system ensures that only the precise volume of gas required to overcome the mass and resistance of the rifle's moving assembly is admitted from the barrel. The manually adjustable gas valve has two settings, one for normal operation, and the second setting for use in the presence of heavy fouling or icing.|$|E
500|$|The barrel has a rifling {{twist rate}} of one turn in [...] Because firing heats up the bore, the {{air-cooled}} barrel {{is equipped with a}} mechanism to remove and replace the barrel assembly with a spare. A folding bipod with adjustable legs is attached near the front of the weapon, though there are provisions for hard-mounting to a M192 Lightweight Ground Mount tripod or vehicle mount. The M249 provides accuracy approaching that of a rifle, combined with the sustained volume of fire of a machine gun. Its original gas regulator offered two different <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> sizes, allowing cyclic rates of fire of 725-rounds per minute (r/min) or 1,000r/min. The latter setting was intended for adverse conditions, such as an excessively dirty firearm or cold weather. The two-position gas regulator was discarded as part of a product improvement program. Sustained rate of fire, the rate of fire at which the gunner can fire continuously without overheating, is approximately 85r/min.|$|E
500|$|The product {{improvement}} program kit replaced the original steel tubular stock {{with a plastic}} stock based upon {{the shape of the}} heavier M240 machine gun. The change in stocks allowed for the addition of a hydraulic buffer system to reduce recoil. In addition, the dual <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> settings were reduced to only one; variants with the {{product improvement}} kit can no longer fire at a higher cyclic speed. A handguard was added above the barrel to prevent burns, and the formerly fixed barrel changing handle was swapped for a folding unit. Certain parts were beveled or chamfered to prevent cutting soldiers' hands and arms. Other changes involved the bipod, pistol grip, flash suppressor, and sights. Over the years, additional modifications have been introduced as part of the Soldier Enhancement Program and Rapid Fielding Initiative. These include an improved bipod, 100– and 200–round fabric [...] "soft pack" [...] magazines (to replace the original plastic ammunition boxes), and Picatinny rails for the feed tray cover and forearm so that optics and other accessories may be added.|$|E

2500|$|Gas is tapped {{from the}} barrel as the bullet moves past a <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> located above the rifle's front sight base. The gas expands into the port {{and down a}} gas tube, located above the barrel that runs from the front sight base into the AR-15's upper receiver. Here, the gas tube {{protrudes}} into a [...] "gas key" [...] (bolt carrier key), which accepts the gas and funnels it into the bolt carrier.|$|E

50|$|The M1917 RSC (for: Ribeyrolles, Sutter and Chauchat) was {{formally}} adopted in May 1916 and {{a fairly large}} number (86,000) had been manufactured by November 1918. It was less expensive to manufacture than the Meunier rifle since it used standard Lebel rifle components, notably: the barrel, stock, handguard, barrel bands and trigger guard. Above all else, it was chambered for the standard 8mm Lebel ammunition, which was loaded on special five-round en-bloc clips. The Mle 1917 RSC was gas operated with a rotating bolt, the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> being located underneath the barrel and near the muzzle as in the later M1 Garand rifle. The Mle 1917 was widely distributed among French infantry during 1918. However the troops did not like it as they found it too heavy, too long and too difficult to service and to maintain in the trenches. The weak point of this rifle {{was the size of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> located under {{the front end of the}} barrel. Because of its very small internal diameter the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> tended to foul up with repeated firings thus leading to weaker and weaker bolt returns in prolonged use. Hence the <b>gas</b> <b>port</b> required frequent cleaning out (every 100 rounds or so) which could be performed after removing the large brass screw under the front end of the barrel. Furthermore, the special clip for the Mle 1917 was not particularly strong.|$|E

The heavy spring, combined with the greater inertia of the massive slide, results in a manageable recoil impulse without resorting to the gas operation of the Desert Eagle and Wildey designs. The absence of any small, easily fouled <b>gas</b> <b>ports</b> makes the LAR Grizzly capable of firing cast lead bullets reliably.|$|R

50|$|The Bushmaster Dissipator {{combines}} a longer sight radius with a shorter barrel {{to allow more}} effective use of the iron sights.

Bushmaster's solution was to use a low-profile gas block in the normal position for carbine-length barrels and fit the front sight tower/gas block, which is not connected to the gas system, further forward to create the longer sight radius.|$|E
