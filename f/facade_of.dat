We present results from two studies: a cross-sectional survey of 155 North American Doctoral Students, and {{a longitudinal study}} of 286 working adults. The findings from both studies extend previous research by demonstrating that high levels of perceived organizational support and leader member exchange significantly reduce <b>facades</b> <b>of</b> conformity. A positive relationship between <b>facades</b> <b>of</b> conformity and emotional exhaustion was observed, but results {{for the relationship between}} <b>facades</b> <b>of</b> conformity and work engagement were inconsistent.
