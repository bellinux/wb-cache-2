Oblique fast shocks have a leading ion <b>inertia</b> <b>wave</b> train if M sub A is smaller than root of M(+) /M(-) cos theta/ 2 and a trailing electron inertia train if M sub A is greater than root of M(+) /M(-) cos theta/ 2. If the downstream sound speed exceeds the flow speed, linear wave theory predicts a trailing ion acoustic structure which probably resides within the magnetic shock. For a turbulent shock model in which an effective electron-ion collision frequency exceeds the lower hybrid frequency, ions decouple from the magnetic field; the shock wave train now trails with electron inertia and electron gyroradius lengths.

For simple container shapes and for solid-body rotations, the frequencies and mode shapes of <b>inertia</b> <b>waves</b> can be readily calculated following the assumptions of linearity and potential flow. Our simulations seek to recreate the classic experiments of Fultz (1959) in which inertial waves within a cylindrical container of spinning fluid were driven via an axially oscillating disk situated on the container axis. Fultz found that the mode shapes and frequencies observed matched the linear inviscid predictions well, although it was unclear how exact resonance was assessed. We have employed a spectral element DNS method to carry out axisymmetric simulations with dimensionless parameters chosen to match those of Fultz’s experiment, with varying cylinder geometries, and where the paddle motion was simulated by a fixed boundary within the fluid on which oscillatory boundary conditions were imposed. Resonance is assessed {{on the basis of}} maxima in the peak amount of flow kinetic energy for fixed paddle motion amplitude, or alternatively on the basis of minimum peak-to-peak force exerted on the paddle boundary.

Strip theory is used to develop transfer function phase and magnitude between surface water waves and the slender body pitch, heave, and surge forces and moment for the vehicle in head seas, and for pitch, heave, yaw, and sway forces and moments in beam seas. Experiments are conducted which verify this method of transfer function calculation, and demonstrate the effects of vehicle forward motion in the head seas case. Using known sea spectra and linear time invariant systems theory allows for estimation of the water wave disturbance spectra for these forces and moments. Application of sliding control techniques are then developed for the underwater vehicle longitudinal plane equations of motion. Computer simulations are used to demonstrate the dependence of underwater vehicle depth control upon the pitch control, and adaptive pitch control is shown to provide good performance in the presence of substantial parametric uncertainty. Pitch disturbance rejection properties of variations of the sliding controller are investigated. Both single frequency and stochastic disturbances are used, and the stochastic disturbance is developed using the results of the earlier investigation. [URL]...|$|R

40|$|A {{transfer}} function analysis {{is used to}} analyze the Turkel-Zwas explicit large time step scheme applied to the shallow-water equations. The {{transfer function}} concept leads to insight into the behavior of this discretization scheme in terms of comparison between continuous and discrete amplitude, phase, and group velocity coefficients. The dependence of the distortion increases with the increase in the time-step size taken for the Turkel-Zwas scheme, which depends on the ratio between a coarse and a tine mesh. A comparison with earlier results of Schoenstadt (Naval Post-Graduate School Report NPS- 53 - 79 - 001, 1978 (unpublished)) shows the Turkel-Zwas scheme to give reasonable results up to time steps three times larger than the CFL limit. 0 1989 Academic Press, Inc. 1. IN~~oDLJCTI~N The transfer function approach introduced by Schoenstadt [7, 8] has been used by him to study the behavior of the semi-discrete shallow water equations discretized with different staggered and unstaggered finite-difference grid arrangements for dispersion and geostrophic adjustment properties. The use of the transfer function approach leads to important insights into the differences caused by various discretization schemes, differences that do not directly emerge from phase propagation considerations alone. In the present paper we apply the transfer function approach to the Turkel-Zwas explicit large time-step scheme for the shallow-water (S-W) equations (Navon and de Villiers, [6]).

40|$|The wave {{propagation}} in the partially ionized ionosphere {{plays an important}} role in the magnetosphere ionosphere coupling. For example, the ionosphere may supports very low-frequency Alfven wave which can be caused by a balance between the bulk fluid inertia (mostly due to neutrals in the lower and middle E region) and the deformation of the magnetic field. The plasma neutral collisional momentum exchange facilitates the transfer of the magnetic stress (felt directly by the ions) to the neutrals.

It is found that the time dependence of the background wave strongly influences the gravity wave packet propagation. For example, the time variations may inhibit critical levels, which are observed when the background wave is time independent. The gravity wave activity that escapes the background wave and the wave activity that is backreflected are quantified for gravity waves of different vertical wavenumbers and frequencies. Strong partial backreflection associated with elastic scattering is commonly observed.

The critical reflux values associated with {{the product of the}} second-order (unit) body forcing and the Reynolds number (representing the viscous dissipations and is the ratio of <b>wave</b> <b>inertia</b> and viscous dissipation effects) decrease as the Knudsen number (representing the rarefaction measure) increases from zero to 0. 1. We obtained the critical bounds for matter-freezed or zero-volume-flowrate states corresponding to specific Reynolds numbers and wave numbers which might be linked to the dissipative evolution of the Universe. Our results also show that for certain time-averaged evolution of the matter (gas) there might be existence of negative-pressur...|$|R
