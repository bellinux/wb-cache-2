The group, composed of Palmer, Richard House, Wendy Jacob, and John Ploof, created work {{at the intersection of}} art and activism. For example, their 1993 [...] "Flood: A Volunteer Network for Active Participation in Healthcare," [...] consisted of a <b>hydroponic</b> <b>garden</b> in a storefront in the Rogers Park, Chicago, neighborhood to be used by HIV/AIDS service organizations. The group was founded, in part, as a reaction to trends in art-making that emphasized the global rather than the specificity of place. As the group wrote in a collective statement: [...] "Haha came together to look for ways in which place does matter, in which the particularities of living in a locally and sensually embedded situation....deeply affect our lives." ...|$|E
40|$|This {{doctoral}} dissertation is an interdisciplinary investigation of contemporary community-based art practices. I analyze {{the social and}} political implications of these practices as structures of radical democracy, as relations of collectivity that include the other-than-human, and for new understandings of subjectivity as relational. This work is based in communication studies, but also draws from cultural theory, philosophy, art history, social geography, political theory and feminist thought. Using a multi-method qualitative approach, including ethnographic practices of friendship as method and self-reflexive journal writing, I examine three cases of community-based art. 	The first is that of the international artists’ collective WochenKlausur who were invited to teach a ‘learning through doing’ class at Alfred University in upstate New York. The project was largely considered a failure, but one that revealed the specificity of WochenKlausur’s method, which is to create social interventions using principles of agonistic democracy, as articulated by Chantal Mouffe. I look at their practice to highlight how its replicability could be useful for alternative social infrastructures. For my second site I chose the exemplary historical project Flood by Haha, which involved the creation of a <b>hydroponic</b> <b>garden</b> in a storefront to grow vegetables for people living with HIV/AIDS. I argue that their project created a collective of humans and other-than-humans through their use of the <b>hydroponic</b> <b>garden,</b> a technological feature that revealed complicated systems of interconnection. Deploying the philosophy of Gilbert Simondon and Brian Massumi, I articulate the importance of other-than-humans to collectivity and to understanding subjectivity as primarily relational. The third case is the Spiral Garden, an art-garden-play program for differently-abled and able-bodied children in Toronto, Ontario. Here the concept and practice of friendship, developed using the philosophy of Georgio Agamben, Maurice Blanchot and Simon Critchley, introduces an open-ended structure of relation, creating affective ties while preserving difference in proximity. 	Situated within a broader analysis of community-based art, each of these case studies illustrates alternative structures for collective art practice that can be used as models for creating new relational modes amongst and across humans and other-than-humans as life-building gestures. ...|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} (pre-1930) {{parts of the}} last century, the coastal areas of northernmost South Carolina were used mostly as farming sites (the real estate {{monolith}} now known as Burroughs and Chapin for decades was named “Myrtle Beach Farms”). Sea breezes washed nutrients on crops planted on sand dunes, much as now is done through roots in <b>hydroponic</b> <b>gardens,</b> and cotton and tobacco thrived; farmers from Loris, Gallivant’s Ferry, Florence and other low-country towns bought land on the coast for practical reasons and then spent summers with their families there, rather than stay in the hellish heat and sand fleas of their main farms.|$|R
5000|$|A {{comic book}} named Space Family Robinson was {{published}} by Gold Key Comics and written by Gaylord DuBois.

They lived in [...] "Space Station One", a spacious moving craft with <b>hydroponic</b> <b>gardens,</b> observatory, and 2 small shuttle crafts ("Spacemobiles").

50|$|Acting on hints from Jeff, Chuck stows away on Eros, {{hiding in}} the section holding the ship’s <b>hydroponic</b> <b>gardens.</b> With its six-man crew and one {{stowaway}} on board, the ship blasts off from the Moon and the pilot Nat Rothman quickly puts it onto a Hohmann transfer orbit that will take the expedition to Mars. All too quickly Chuck is discovered by the ship’s engineer, Richard Steele, and taken to the ship’s captain and the expedition’s leader, Miles Vance. Officially Chuck is under arrest and Vance chides him for taking one-seventh {{of each of the}} other men’s supplies. Unofficially, though, every member of the crew is delighted with the stunt and even the people on the Moon and Earth find cause to cheer. The celebratory atmosphere does not last long.|$|R
40|$|While {{living and}} working in todays {{high-tech}} world, the ability to perform tasks and understand the system structure of technology may affect our lives in many ways. For example, calibrating a medical device such as a blood glucose meter may be infrequently performed but adequate knowledge of the system structure may be critical for doing it correctly. This and other forms of technology vary in complexity and require training for proper use. Due to age-related differences in skill acquisition, the design of proper training may be especially important for older adults when learning to use new technology. One factor to consider when developing age-specific training is the type of information presented during training. In general, little research has addressed the effect of information type on the development of an understanding of the system structure and fewer have examined the influence of age. The current study compared the effects of emphasizing actions or concepts during training on performance on multiple measures of learning. Participants completed one of two tutorials for operating a computer-simulated <b>hydroponic</b> <b>garden</b> control. One tutorial presented participants with instructions that focused specific actions to operate the system. The other tutorial displayed instructions that focused on generalized system concepts. At test, overall participants in the concept training condition were faster and more accurate than those in the action training condition for both novel and familiar tasks. Concept training also reduced age-related differences in performance. Results suggest that concept training may lead {{to the development of a}} better understanding of the system structure. M. S.

40|$|Growing food {{in little}} space is a {{challenge}} being faced daily by families in crowded areas. Hydroponics, the art of growing plants with no soil in water with added nutrients, is one solution but it has faced opposition from urban planners and scientists who stress that its complexity is beyond the normal woman or man. As the article on urban agriculture in Spore 81 urged, 'The scientist, whether based in a laboratory or a local community group, who develops a popular and transferable method of hydroponics will be remembered far into the next millennium for {{a significant contribution to}} food security. ' Is Home Hydroponic Gardens the answer to the prayer? It could well be, with its rugged hard-cover full of careful and detailed texts and superb step-by-step coloured illustrations explaining how to use simplified hydroponics, requiring no mechanical devices. It gives methods and construction techniques for building hydroponic gardens on waste lots in towns, in backyards, on rooftops, with details of experiences in Zimbabwe, Senegal and Colombia. There are precise and proven recipes for the production of home-made organic nutrient mixes, as well as explanations of how plants take their nutrients and grow. This is real popular science at work, with dietary advice and recipes following the section on the daily chores of plant care and harvesting the dozens of suggested fruits, herbs, spices and salad, root and table vegetables. With a little bit of effort, a family with a <b>hydroponic</b> <b>garden</b> will not only end up healthier and wealthier, but also much better informed about how plants grow, and thus able to encourage the neighbours to take the hydroponic route too.

40|$|Abstract ROOTS – What Could Emerge Out of Thinking and Acting Networked ROOTS as Design?   This bachelor’s thesis uses ROOTS as {{a method}} {{designed}} to engage in both thinking and acting inside networks, by creating a <b>hydroponic</b> <b>gardening</b> network. As a designer one engages in many different fields of design. The most complicated design is designing networks with function, interlaced and embedded in everyday life. This is known as accountability, to be accountable to ones decisions and to act on many perspectives when designing. Accountability is designing from somewhere, and being aware of where that somewhere stems from. ROOTS visualizes accountability in a network, as accountability entails thinking and acting inside a network, and by doing so one actively engages in thinking about futures and design as a whole. When asking oneself what could emerge out of thinking and acting networked ROOTS as design, one begins to speculate in matters of vast networked complexity. From observation using methods such as ANT, the technologic extension T-ANT and also conducting a study in messiness, information is created and from the information, valuing becomes present, from valuing knowledge grows, from knowledge comes accountability and the network creates another cycle of ROOTS.   Keywords: Design, Network, Accountability, Complexit...|$|R

" Through the glass, a plain white room can be seen, its centre occupied by {{rows and rows of}} carefully ordered plants. Sprouting from individual holes cut in white plastic tubing through which nutrients are fed, each plant reaches slowly towards the two lOoo-watt halide lamps overhead. The trays are suspended three feet above the floor on a basic wood-framed table.

40|$|The Pumi {{people of}} Sichuan Province are {{traditionally}} nomadic {{producers of the}} yak. Since 1949, they have relied {{more and more on}} soil based agriculture to produce subsistence crops. They survive on a diet based on cereal crops and yak products of milk, butter and yoghurt. The families graze their animals in the high Hengduan Mountains and rely on the grass produced naturally in the grazing area. This paper proposes the introduction of microfarming techniques into this region, a technology offered and introduced on a family by family basis. A microfarm is a one-hectare family farm that produces food and agricultural products using simplified hydroponics, fertigation and aquaculture. The first field of 435 m 2 can produce 1 ton of corn, 2 tons of corn fodder, 0. 5 ton of broad beans, and a winter crop of alfalfa, wheat or other cover crops suitable for forage. This field uses gravity fed drip irrigation requiring about 500 L of water per day and an estimated 0. 25 kg of fertilizer per day in growing period of 120 days. Using the rotation of a legume reduces the required nitrogen fertilizer. Rainwater should be collected to supply the system with its reliable daily source of water. Simplified <b>hydroponics</b> <b>garden</b> of 40 m 2 should provide an additional 5 kg of fresh vegetables per day for family consumption or a similar amount of commercial crops for local sale.
