40|$|This thesis {{examines}} {{within the}} institutional framework settings how {{the concept of}} Sustainable and Responsible Property Investment (SRPI) has developed and to the extent SRPI has been adopted in a developing country, namely Malaysia. The question of Sustainable and Responsible Property Investment (SRPI) interpretation is important in this context given that developing countries represent the most rapidly expanding economies and most lucrative markets for property investment. Specifically the thesis examines the understandings of SRPI and the concept link with SRI, and the drivers and barriers to SRPI practice. Specifically, the thesis investigates how particular Malaysian Property Investment organisations (MPIOs) have interpreted the concept of SRPI, and whether the overall concept of SRPI has taken similar or different form than the practice in developed market. The study used a mixed-method approach. It uses triangulation of data collection methods and multiple techniques including content analysis and Delphi technique. The study used a modified institutional framework to aid in explaining, interpreting and understanding the divergence/convergence of SRPI in the developing country context. Content analysis of selected public listed property investment organisations in Malaysia i. e. real estate investment trusts (REITS), property companies and institutional <b>investor</b> <b>reports</b> from 2008 to 2011 proceeded through line-by-line analysis and coding according to inductively generated categories. The results from content analysis revealed a narrow representation of SRPI in the MPIOs reports. Despite the requirement by the Bursa Malaysia to report on CSR and sustainability activities, there were minimal disclosures on environmental and social impacts caused by their property management and investment activities, on most reports shows emphasis of MPIO’s on philanthropic activities. The Delphi study aims to explore, examine and build on the views of experts and influential people in SRPI. It was also felt necessary to combine local expertise and experts from developed countries. Overall, SRPI in Malaysia takes different form than SRPI in countries where is SRPI mainstreamed. The study points in the direction of SRPI “cross-vergence”, whereby global convergence and local divergence forces are interacting synergistically. The National and Cultural religious value in particular are two strong elements supporting the drivers of divergence of SRPI. Through the rigorous exploration this thesis contributes to the further understanding of sustainable and responsible investment and the drivers. The proposed framework has provided the principles, whereas the empirical work translated the principles into practice. The results of the thesis contribute to the literature by providing new evidence on the drivers of SRPI in emerging market. These findings would be of use to property investors and other actors in the industry, including fund manager...|$|E

Moreover, analysis of the micro data indicates that expectations of both risk and returns on stocks are strongly influenced by perceptions of economic conditions. In particular, when investors believe macroeconomic conditions are more expansionary, they tend to expect both higher returns and lower volatility. This is difficult to reconcile with the canonical view that expected returns on stocks rise during recessions to compensate household investors for increased exposure or sensitivity to macroeconomic risks. Finally, the relevance of these investors' reported expectations is supported by the finding of a significant link between their expectations and portfolio choices. In particular, we show that portfolio equity positions tend to be higher for those respondents that anticipate higher expected returns or lower uncertainty...|$|R
40|$|This work investigates both {{theoretically}} and empirically how the behaviour {{of financial}} analysts {{is affected by}} competition, measured as the strength of coverage of a stock from other analysts. The interaction among analysts and investors is modelled as a dynamic cheap talk game. The theoretical model shows that analysts having {{a conflict of interest}} with <b>investors,</b> <b>report</b> information truthfully with higher probability if other, “neutral”, analysts report information on the same stock. This empirical prediction is tested on data about recommendations on IPOs. The main result is that analysts working for the lead underwriter of the IPO (“insiders”) are more optimistic when there are no other analysts (not working for the lead underwriter, “outsiders”) covering the stock. The data also show that insiders do not seem to use the information contained in outsiders recommendations. Finally, outsiders are not influenced by recommendations previously issued by insiders. These results also allow to discriminate between competing hypothesis brought forward to explain insider’s overoptimism. The empirical evidence suggests that insider analysts overoptimism is induced by incentives rather than by a “psychological bias”. Keywords: Competition, Financial Analysts, IPOs, Recommendations.
