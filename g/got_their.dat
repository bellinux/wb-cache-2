One-time bracelet winner Erick Lindgren also boasts a pedigree of starting out as a dealer.|$|E
5|$|Silverchair were an Australian rock band, which {{formed in}} 1992 as Innocent Criminals in Merewether, Newcastle with the line-up of Ben Gillies on drums, Daniel Johns on vocals and guitars, and Chris Joannou on bass guitar. The group <b>got</b> <b>their</b> big break in mid-1994 when they won a {{national}} demo competition conducted by SBS TV show Nomad and ABC radio station, Triple J. The band were signed by Murmur, and were successful on the Australian and international rock stages.|$|E
5|$|After an {{incomplete}} pass from quarterback Tyrod Taylor, the Hokies <b>got</b> <b>their</b> first big offensive break {{of the second}} half. On a designed play, Taylor scrambled for 31yards, the largest play in the game for the Hokies. Two successful runs by running back Branden Ore followed, earning the Hokies 23more yards and pushing the offense deep into Boston College territory. A false-start penalty set the Hokie offense back, but on the next play, quarterback Sean Glennon connected with wide receiver Eddie Royal on a 24-yard strike for a touchdown. The touchdown and extra point were the first points {{of the second half}} and gave Virginia Tech a 2316 lead with 6:30 remaining in the game.|$|E

5|$|At Cyber Sunday during DX's {{feud with}} Rated-RKO, special guest referee Eric Bischoff allowed the illegal {{use of a}} weapon to give Rated-RKO the win. At Survivor Series, DX <b>got</b> <b>their</b> revenge when their team {{defeated}} Edge and Orton's team in a clean sweep during their five-on-five elimination match. In January 2007, at New Year's Revolution, DX and Rated-RKO fought to a no contest after Triple H suffered a legitimate torn right quadriceps (similar to the one he suffered in 2001 in his other leg) 15 minutes into the match. Surgery was successfully performed on January 9, 2007 by Dr. James Andrews.|$|E
5|$|Black {{churches in}} Maryland hosted many musical, {{as well as}} {{political}} and educational, activities, and many African American musicians <b>got</b> <b>their</b> start performing in churches, including Anne Brown, Marian Anderson, Ethel Ennis and Cab Calloway, in the 20th century. Doctrinal disputes did not prevent musical cooperation, which included both sacred and secular music. Church choirs frequently worked together, even across denominational divides, and church-goers often visited other establishments to see visiting performers. Organists were a major part of African American church music in Baltimore, and some organists became well known, Baltimore's including Sherman Smith of Union Baptist, Luther Mitchell of Centennial Methodist and Julia Calloway of Sharon Baptist. Many churches also offered music education, beginning as early as the 1870s with St. Francis Academy.|$|E
5|$|For the 2003–04 season, the Rockets {{moved into}} their new arena, the Toyota Center, with a seating {{capacity}} of 18,500. During the 2007–08 NBA season where the team achieved a 22-game winning streak, the Rockets <b>got</b> <b>their</b> best numbers to date, averaging 17,379 spectators. These were exceeded once James Harden joined {{the team in}} 2013. The Rockets averaged 18,123 spectators during the 2013–14 season, selling out 39 out of the 41 home games. 2014–15 had even better numbers, with 40 sellouts and an average of 18,230 tickets sold.|$|E

5|$|In the United States, {{botanist}} Asa Gray, an American {{colleague of}} Darwin, negotiated with a Boston publisher for publication of an authorised American version, but learnt that two New York publishing firms were already planning {{to exploit the}} absence of international copyright to print Origin. Darwin was delighted by {{the popularity of the}} book, and asked Gray to keep any profits. Gray managed to negotiate a 5% royalty with Appleton's of New York, who <b>got</b> <b>their</b> edition out in mid January 1860, and the other two withdrew. In a May letter, Darwin mentioned a print run of 2,500 copies, {{but it is not clear}} if this referred to the first printing only as there were four that year.|$|E
5|$|Johnson and the Sonics <b>got</b> <b>their</b> revenge in the 1978–79 season. After {{clinching}} the Pacific Division with a 52–30 record, {{the team}} met the Bullets {{again in the}} 1979 NBA Finals. After losing Game 1, the Sonics won the next four games to take the finals series, helped by Johnson who averaged almost 23points along with six rebounds and assists per game. He scored 32points in a Game 4 overtime victory, and was named NBA Finals MVP. It was during this season that Johnson established himself {{as one of the}} best guards in the league; he averaged 15.9points and 3.5assists per game, and made his first All-Defensive First Team and All-Star Game appearance.|$|E
5|$|Passenger {{transport}} was of two types; trains that {{corresponded with}} the ferries and connected with trains at Tinnoset, and commuter trains transporting workers to the plants at Rjukan. The commuter trains were initiated in 1913, and Norsk Hydro started building housing at Ingolfsland and Tveito, and both Ingolfsland and Miland <b>got</b> <b>their</b> own stops, and from 1919 stations. The two kilometers (one mile) commuter train from Rjukan to Ingofsland took five minutes; a month pass cost NOK 2.50 for employees and their families. There were seventeen departures {{in each direction}} per week, timed to fit with the working times at the plant. This increased to 58 in 1916, when a new stop at Tveito was opened.|$|E

The Buffaloes <b>got</b> <b>their</b> only score of the game, a field goal, {{at the start of}} the secondquarter. Vince Young, Limas Sweed, David Thomas, and Jamaal Charles scored touchdowns in the secondquarter to give the Horns a 42–3 lead at halftime. In the third quarter, Selvin Young, Charles and Melton each scored rushing touchdowns. Brandon Foster scored a touchdown on defense due to Michael Griffin blocking a Colorado punt. Halfway through the third quarter, Texas already had 70 points, but went on cruise control from that point on and did not score again.|$|E
5|$|The New York {{stage was}} filled with ribald humor and sexually {{offensive}} comedy; when movie producers started to put wisecracks in their sound pictures, they sought New York performers. Popular comics such as the Marx Brothers <b>got</b> <b>their</b> start on Broadway in front of live audiences. Censors complained {{when they had to}} keep up with the deluge of jokes in pictures in the early 1930s, some of which were designed to go over their heads. The comic banter of some early sound films was rapid-fire, non-stop, and frequently exhausting for the audience by the final reel.|$|E
5|$|The Oakland Raiders, with an NFL-best 11–1 record, {{scored three}} {{touchdown}}s before the Buccaneers <b>got</b> <b>their</b> third first down. Mark van Eeghen scored on two 1-yard runs. A 2-yard Ed Williams touchdown run tied the score at 7–7 after the Buccaneers recovered a fumble at the Oakland 14-yard {{line in the}} first quarter. A Dave Green field goal made the score 21–10 at halftime, but Ken Stabler threw for two third-quarter touchdowns for the Raiders. Steve Spurrier finished the Buccaneers’ scoring with a fourth-quarter touchdown pass to Morris Owens.

5|$|The Trylon Cinema (formerly Trylon Microcinema) is a 92-seat {{movie theater}} in the Longfellow {{neighborhood}} of Minneapolis, Minnesota. The cinema was founded and is currently run by Take-Up Productions, a group of volunteers who <b>got</b> <b>their</b> start at the Oak Street Cinema before establishing the Trylon in 2009 within a former warehouse. A 2017 expansion led {{to an increase in}} the cinema's seating capacity and accessibility. Throughout its history, the venue has featured a variety of regular programming, ranging from career retrospectives of famous directors to B movies and cult films. The Trylon has been well received by critics who have praised its film lineup, intimacy, and atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|When Buffy is on patrol, she laments in {{song about}} how uninspired her life has become ("Going Through the Motions"). The {{next morning at}} the Magic Box, the gang reveal that they also sang that evening.

Buffy learns that the whole town is affected when she looks outside the shop to see a large group (led by series writer and producer David Fury) singing and dancing about how a dry-cleaning service <b>got</b> <b>their</b> stains out ("The Mustard").|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the period of the wars of {{independence}} itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government, for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism {{because of the lack of}} well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they <b>got</b> <b>their</b> rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the caudillos, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.|$|E

5|$|In June 2001, Combs ended Bad Boy Entertainment's {{joint venture}} with Arista Records, gaining full control of Bad Boy, its catalogue, and its roster of artists. The Saga Continues..., {{released}} on July 10 in North America, was the last studio album released by the joint venture. The album reached number 2 on the Billboard 200 and the Top R/Hip-Hop Albums charts, and was eventually certified Platinum. It is the only studio album under the P. Diddy name, and the first album by Sean Combs not to feature any guest appearances by Jay-Z or Lil Kim. Combs was {{executive producer of the}} reality TV show Making the Band, which appeared on MTV from 2002 to 2009. The show involved interviewing candidates and creating musical acts that would then enter the music business. Acts that <b>got</b> <b>their</b> start this way include Da Band, Danity Kane, Day26, and Donnie Klang.|$|E
5|$|In late 2004, the National Annenberg Election Survey at the University of Pennsylvania ran a {{study of}} American {{television}} viewers and found that fans of The Daily Show had a more accurate idea of the facts behind the 2004 presidential election than most others, including those who primarily <b>got</b> <b>their</b> news through the national network evening newscasts and through reading newspapers. However, in a 2004 campaign {{survey conducted by the}} Pew Research Center those who cited comedy shows such as The Daily Show as a source for news were among the least informed on campaign events and key aspects of the candidates' backgrounds while those who cited the Internet, National Public Radio, and news magazines were the most informed. Even when age and education were taken into account, the people who learned about the campaigns through the Internet were still found to be the most informed, while those who learned from comedy shows were the least informed.|$|E

Emerson, Lake & Palmer debuted at the 1970 Isle of Wight Festival, at which Supertramp, Family and Jethro Tull also appeared. Jethro Tull were also present at the 1969 Newport Jazz Festival, the first year in which that festival invited rock bands to perform. Hawkwind appeared at many British festivals throughout the 1970s, although they sometimes showed up uninvited, set up a stage {{on the periphery of the}} event, and played for free.|$|E
