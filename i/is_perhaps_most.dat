5|$|In March 2006 {{the book}} Game of Shadows, written by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru-Wada, was {{released}} amid {{a storm of}} media publicity including the cover of Sports Illustrated. Initially small excerpts of the book were released by the authors in the issue of Sports Illustrated. The book alleges Bonds used stanozolol {{and a host of}} other steroids, and <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> responsible for the change in public opinion regarding Bonds's steroid use.|$|E
5|$|In British service, the Westland Sea King {{provided}} {{a wide range}} of services in both the Royal Navy and the Royal Air Force. As well as wartime roles in the Falklands War, the Gulf War, the Balkans conflict, the Iraq War and the Afghanistan War, the Sea King <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> well known in its capacity as a Royal Navy Search and Rescue (red and grey livery) and RAF Search and Rescue Force (yellow livery) helicopter. The Sea King was also adapted to meet the Royal Navy's requirement for a ship-based airborne early warning platform.|$|E
5|$|Majungasaurus <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{distinctive}} for its skull ornamentation, {{including the}} swollen and fused nasals and the frontal horn. Other ceratosaurs, including Carnotaurus, Rajasaurus, and Ceratosaurus itself bore crests on the head. These structures {{are likely to}} {{have played a role in}} intraspecific competition, although their exact function within that context is unknown. The hollow cavity inside the frontal horn of Majungasaurus would have weakened the structure and probably precluded its use in direct physical combat, although the horn may have served a display purpose. While there is variation in the ornamentation of Majungasaurus individuals, there is no evidence for sexual dimorphism.|$|E

5|$|Nielsen <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> closely {{associated}} outside Denmark with his six symphonies, written between 1892 and 1925. The works {{have much in}} common: they are all just over 30 minutes long, brass instruments are {{a key component of}} the orchestration, and they all exhibit unusual changes in tonality, which heighten the dramatic tension. From its opening bars, Symphony No. 1 (Op. 7, 1890–92), while reflecting the influence of Grieg and Brahms, shows Nielsen's individuality. In the Second (Op. 16, 1901–02), Nielsen embarks on the development of human character. Inspiration came from a painting in an inn depicting the four temperaments (choleric, phlegmatic, melancholic and sanguine).|$|E
5|$|Siward <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{famous for}} his {{expedition}} in 1054 against Macbeth, King of Scotland, an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son, Osbjorn. The origin of Siward's conflict with the Scots is unclear. According to the Libellus de Exordio, in 1039 or 1040, the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham. Within a year, Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad. The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh, and though no {{connection between the two}} events is clear it is likely that they were linked.|$|E
5|$|The Bonville-Courtenay feud {{is often}} given {{as an example}} of the degree to which law and order and respect for the king had broken down in the provinces. As a result, modern historians have often {{considered}} it a cause of the later Wars of the Roses; and indeed, the course of the feud often closely followed the sectarian politics of the day. The feud <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> well known for culminating in an armed encounter at Clyst (called the fight, or sometimes the battle, of Clyst), near Exeter, which resulted in loss of life.|$|E
50|$|The Clameur <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> famously {{used by a}} {{landowner}} named Asselin FitzArthur {{to object}} to the burial of William the Conqueror.|$|R
5000|$|He <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{noted for}} his {{longtime}} collaboration with interior designer Henry Davis Sleeper, {{the owner of}} the Beauport, Sleeper-McCann House, in Gloucester, MA.|$|R
5000|$|The {{word order}} is variable, {{and it is}} {{difficult}} to say which typology is basic. The verb-absolutive orders AVO and VAO <b>are</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> common.|$|R
5|$|The name of Zobel <b>is,</b> <b>perhaps,</b> <b>most</b> {{well known}} {{with regard to}} {{impedance}} compensation networks for loudspeakers. Clearly, his designs have applications in this field. However, none of Zobel's patents or articles appear to discuss this topic. It is unclear whether he actually designed anything specifically for loudspeakers. The closest we get to {{this is where he}} speaks of impedance matching into a transducer, but here he is discussing a circuit to equalize a submarine cable, or in another instance where clearly he has in mind the hybrid transformer which terminates a line going into a telephone instrument on a phantom circuit.|$|E
5|$|As {{the title}} suggests, {{one of the}} major themes of the film {{involves}} the temptations Father John faces to sin and stray from his priestly calling. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> strongly manifested in his apparent ambivalence regarding the vow of celibacy required of Catholic priests. As Father John goes deeper into the red-light district and the seedier aspects of Minneapolis, he appears to face temptations from the prostitution and overt sexuality surrounding him. Additionally, it can be interpreted that his interest in Linda is one of physical attraction, as well as a desire to help her. This is further manifested through the sudden reappearance of his former girlfriend, for whom Father John admits to still harboring romantic feelings. The priest demonstrates conflicting emotions when it comes to maintaining his priestly vows and his relationship with Nadine.|$|E
5|$|David O. Selznick (1902–1965) was an American {{motion picture}} {{producer}} whose work {{consists of three}} short subjects, 67 feature films, and one television production made between 1923 and 1957. He <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> notable as the producer of the 1939 epic Gone With the Wind. Selznick was born in Pittsburgh and educated in public schools in Brooklyn and Manhattan. He began working in the film industry in New York while in his teens {{as an assistant to}} his father, jeweler-turned-film producer Lewis J. Selznick. In 1923, he began producing films himself, starting with two documentary shorts and then a minor feature, Roulette (1924). Moving to Hollywood in 1926, Selznick became employed at Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM), where he produced two films before switching to Paramount in early 1928. After helping to guide Paramount into the sound era, Selznick moved to RKO Radio in 1931 where he served as the studio's executive producer. During his time at RKO he oversaw the production of King Kong (1933) and helped to develop Katharine Hepburn and Myrna Loy into major film stars.|$|E

50|$|The {{last two}} peaks <b>are</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> famous for forming the valley where the Apollo 15 mission made its landing. This landing was {{considered}} one of the most scientifically successful missions of the Apollo program and started the last three J-Series missions that included the lunar rover and 3-day stays. Apollo 15 explored smaller peak Mons Hadley Delta (δ) and Rima Hadley rille. This <b>was</b> <b>perhaps</b> the <b>most</b> geologically diverse landing site of the program.|$|R

25|$|Pictish {{is thought}} to have {{influenced}} the development of modern Scottish Gaelic. This <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> obvious in the contribution of loan words, but more importantly it is thought that Pictish influenced the syntax of Scottish Gaelic, which bears greater similarity to Brittonic languages than does Irish.|$|E
50|$|Gilsoft was a British (Welsh) {{producer}} {{and publisher of}} video games and related utilities. They <b>are</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> known for The Quill and the later Professional Adventure Writer. The company was named after the founder Tim Gilberts.|$|R

50|$|Braided lines, {{particularly}} the newer synthetics, can be successfully used on {{any type of}} fishing reel, but <b>are</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> well known as excellent lines for bait casting reels, in particular for trolling where they remain especially popular among many fishermen.|$|R
25|$|Telepinu <b>is</b> <b>perhaps</b> <b>most</b> {{famous for}} drawing up the Edict of Telepinu which {{dictated}} {{the laws of}} succession for the Hittite throne. It was designed to stop all the royal murders which {{had taken place in}} the previous decades, which had destabilised the empire and reduced the empire to only its heartland.|$|E

50|$|The Sanisette is self-contained, {{self-cleaning}} public toilet.
