There are many examples where increasing frequencies and severities of droughts and floods appear to follow disruptions to the water-cycle (Millán 2014; Hirsch and Archfield 2015; Erfanian et al. 2017). While global precipitation held relatively constant over recent decades, observations indicate that increases occurred over the tropical oceans and higher latitudes (much of North America and Eurasia), while declines occurred over Africa and various mid latitudes (notably the Mediterranean and southern Asia) (Trenberth 2011; Adler et al. 2017). The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) expresses “medium confidence” that human activities influenced precipitation intensity (especially Northern Hemisphere) over {{the second half of the}} twentieth century (Stocker et al. 2013).

40|$|Two century-scale {{time series}} in {{northern}} Bolivia constrain {{the ages of}} abrupt changes in the physical, geochemical, and biological characteristics of sediments obtained from lakes that formed during deglaciation from the late Pleistocene glacial maximum. The watersheds of Laguna Viscachani (16 {degrees} 12 `S, 68 {degrees} 07 `W, 3780 m) and Lago Taypi Chaka Kkota (16 {degrees} 13 `S, 68 {degrees} 21 `W, 4300 m), located on the eastern and western slopes of the Cordillera Real, respectively, contain small cirque glaciers. A high-resolution chronology of the lake sediments is provided by 23 AMS {sup 14 }C dates of discrete macro-fossils. Late Pleistocene glaciers retreated rapidly, exposing the lake basins between 10, 700 and 9700 {sup 14 }C yr B. P. The sedimentary facies suggest that after 8900 {sup 14 }C B. P. glaciers were absent from the watersheds and remained so during the middle Holocene. An increase in the precipitation-evaporation balance is indicated above unconformities dated to about 2300 {sup 14 }C yr B. P. in both Lago Taypi Chaka Kkota and Laguna Viscachani. An abrupt increase in sediment accumulation rated after 1400 {sup 14 }C yr B. P. signals the onset of Neoglaciation.

40|$|A {{record of}} Holocene {{hydrological}} changes has been produced from variations in oxygen-isotope composition (delta(18) O) preserved in freshwater lake sediments from maritime Antarctica. Small amounts (< 5 %) of authigenic carbonate have been extracted from a non-marl sediment core from Sombre Lake, Signy Island (60 degrees 43 'S, 45 degrees 38 'W). Oxygen-isotope and particle-size analysis provide a sensitive record of hydrological {{events in the}} lake arising from local and regional climate phenomena. The climate affects delta O- 18 through snowpack volume and glacier activity in the catchment, lakewater temperatures, the input versus <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance</b> and the duration of seasonal lake ice cover. The most depleted (negative) delta O- 18 values are associated with influxes of meltwater at times of glacier advance or retreat. Enriched (positive) delta O- 18 values occur during more arid, warmer conditions with longer periods of open water in summer. This isotope record {{can be used to}} determine century-scale to decadal variability in air circulation and moisture origin. Strong similarities with other Holocene proxy records from the Weddell Sea and Antarctic Peninsula Region are apparent, including the mid-Holocene climate optimum followed by the Neoglacial and, most recently, late twentieth-century climatic warming. The oxygen-isotope record from Sombre Lake illustrates the importance of remote islands in contributing to our understanding of teleconnections in atmospheric and oceanographic circulation, sea-ice extent, air temperatures and precipitation in the Southern Ocean...|$|E

Construction on Olushandja dam was completed in 1975. It acts as a storage and balancing dam for water supplied from Calueque. Olushandja dam is 17, 7 kms long and about 300 m wide.

Upgrading of the Calueque facilities is envisaged for 1996. With upgrading virtually complete at Olushandja, the UCT team were commissioned to conduct a SIA on the effect of changing the water level in the dam on the rural communities living in the vicinity of the dam.

ABSTRACT: In Tunisia, irrigation in the arid and semi-arid areas is often accompanied by sodicity and alkalinization of soils, leading to soil degradation a decreased crop yields. In this context, this study aims to analyze the spatio-temporal variation, and depending on depth of the water quality of the dam of Bezirk. Monitoring of physico-chemical parameters, concentrations of nutrients and major elements was performed to identify the factors and phenomena that govern their variations. Compilation and interpretation of all results show the main origin of the major elements is the chemical weathering of rocks exposed in the watershed and nutrients originate soil leaching and degradation of organic matter. The variation {{of the contents of}} dissolved inorganic nitrogen and phosphorus is linked to the level of dissolved oxygen, to the photosynthesis-respiration balance and to the degree of degradation of organic matter. The concentrations of the major elements are mainly controlled by dilution- <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance,</b> ion complexation and biologic activity. The values of conductivity, alkalinity and SAR show that waters of Bezirk dam are of good quality for irrigation and can be used without risk, particularly for moderately salt tolerant plants...|$|E

Evaporative demand (E(o)) in the field was determined by measuring evaporation from open water with a recording <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance.</b> Actual evaporation from the field soil was determined by daily measurement of water content in the top 10 and 20 cm layers. Drying was best described by {{a modified version of the}} square root of time behaviour model of T. A. Black, W. R. Gardener and G. W. Thurtell (The prediction of evaporation drainage and soil water storage for a bare soil. Soil Sci. Am. Proc., 33 : 655 - 660, 1969) and a simple parametric model similar to that proposed by J. J. T. I. Boesten and L. Stroosnijder (Simple model for daily evaporation from fallow tilled soil under spring conditions in a temperate climate. Neth. J. Agric. Sci., 34 : 75 - 80, 1986). The parametric model was incorporated in a model describing water dynamics in a silt loam soil (Typic Hapludalf) on field plots located near Ter Munck, 5 km southwest of Leuven, Belgium. The results show that drying characteristics of tilled soils are influenced by factors such as tillage depth, surface micro-relief, soil type, and the nature of the evaporative demand, and that it is possible to incorporate such effects in evaporation models. However, more research is needed to study the combined effects of tillage type and depth and atmospheric evaporativity on the drying characteristics of different soils, and to compare the relative effect of radiation-dominated evaporativity on the evaporation parameters with that of wind-dominated evaporativity...|$|E
40|$|The Levant {{features}} sharp climatic gradients from North to South {{and from}} West to East {{resulting in a}} large environmental diversity. The lack of long-term record from the northern Levant limits {{our understanding of the}} regional response to glacial-interglacial boundary conditions in this key area. The 250 ka paleoenvironmental reconstruction presented here is a first step to fill this geographical gap. The record comes from a 36 m lacustrine-palustrine sequence cored in the small intra-mountainous karstic basin of Yammoûneh (northern Lebanon). The paper combines times series of sediment properties, paleovegetation, and carbonate oxygen isotopes, to yield a comprehensive view of paleohydrologic-paleoclimatic fluctuations in the basin over the two last glacial-interglacial cycles. Efficient moisture was higher than today during interglacial peaks around 240, 215 – 220, ~ 130 – 120 ka and 11 – 9 ka (although under different Precipitation minus <b>Evaporation</b> <b>balance).</b> Moderate wetting events took place around 170, 150, 105 – 100, 85 – 75, 60 – 55 and 35 ka. The penultimate glacial period was generally wetter than the last glacial stage. Local aridity culminated from the LGM to 15 ka, possibly linked to water storage as ice in the surrounding highlands. An overall decrease in local water availability is observed from the profile base to top. Fluctuations in available water seem to be primarily governed by changes in local summer insolation controlled by the orbital eccentricity modulated by the precession cycle, and by changes in precipitation and temperature seasonality. Our record is roughly consistent with long-term climatic fluctuations in northeastern Mediterranean lands, except during the penultimate glacial phase. It shares some features with speleothem records of western Israel. Conversely, after 130 ka, it is clearly out of phase with hydrological changes in the Dead Sea basin. Potential causes of these spatial heterogeneities, e. g., changes in atmospheric circulation, regional topographic patterns, site-specific climatic and hydrological factors, are discussed...|$|E

40|$|Limestone tuff {{deposits}} precipitated in fluvial environments are {{widespread in}} the northern Morocco and the S Portugal. These deposits represent environmental conditions prone for the carbonate precipitation mainly in areas of Mesozoic limestone substratum with active water seepage from the aquifers. The mesoscopic and microscopic characteristics of tuff deposits from Tetouan (Morocco) and Loule and Tavira (Portugal) are very alike; namely on deposit types (e. g. phytoherm barriers; banded limestones with abundant vegetation macro-remains; carbonates precipitation as cement of some early alluvial conglomerates or interbedded alluvial deposits). The common textural features and macro-facies (e. g. banded calcite in regular layers; moldic porosity; textures resulting from carbonate precipitation mediated by bacteriological activity) point to a similar origin of these limestone tuffs {{on both sides of}} Gibraltar Strait despite their slightly different climatic conditions that are influenced by the active inflow of surface Atlantic water towards the Mediterranean (for the Tetouan region) and by the Azores anticyclone (for the Loulé-Tavira region). The field observations show that the limestone tuffs precipitation is nowadays residual and radiocarbon dating of Portuguese deposits points to a chronological framework for their formation starting {{in the beginning of the}} post-Younger Dryas climatic recovery and ending around 2. 5 ky BP. The oxygen stable isotopes data show a gradual change in the tuffs isotopic signature through the time interval during which the system remained active, without any particular record of climate events such as the 8. 2 ka. The available data and those from monitored modern pluvial characteristics allow the speculation on the parameters controlling the limestone tuffs deposition on both northern and southern sides of the Gibraltar Strait during the Holocene. The carbonate deposition on fluvial systems, such as the studied ones, probably depends on the precipitation / <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance</b> leading to the availability and turbulence of the flowing water along the streams.

40|$|The {{reconstruction}} of paleoenvironmental changes from diatoms in lake sediments {{is based on}} the usual assumption that, in each studied sample, the dominant species reflect the environment that prevailed during the time of deposition. If the environment changed significantly during the period of deposition (several years) one can expect a mixture of species having different or contradictory ecological affinities. In this paper we present analyses of diatoms in surface sediment samples collected in the Lake Ossa area (3 degrees 50 'N, 9 degrees 36 E) and fossil diatoms from a mid-late Holocene core retrieved in the deepest part of the lake. The Lake Ossa area alternates between a short dry season centered at around the northern winter and a long rainy season {{during the rest of the}} year entailing significant changes in water level and pH. Based on multivariate analyses, we will show here that mean annual water depth is the most significant variable explaining the distribution of diatoms in the entire Lake. However, seasonal changes of water level are poorly recorded by diatom assemblages, except in some flat areas on the borders of the lakes where a mixing between species with different affinities to water depth is likely due to seasonal changes in water level. Inferred water depth based on a quantitative transfer function reflected essentially secular to millennial changes in the studied core. The relationship between pH and diatoms is not statistically significant but seasonal to multi-annual pH variations mainly observed in the central parts of the lake are reflected by a mixing of acidophilous and alkaliphilous species. Hierarchical ascending cluster analysis (HAC) considered as the most efficient mean of describing diatom mixing shows that seasonal to multi-annual changes in pH are recorded both in the modern and fossil assemblages. According to the degree of mixing between diatoms with different pH affinities we conclude that short-term pH variability was weaker than today between 5200 and 2700 cal yr BP, stronger between 2700 and 2000 cal yr BP, weaker again between 2000 and 600 cal yr BP and similar to present from 400 cal yr BP onwards. Short-term changes were thus superimposed on secular to millennium trends recorded by modifications in the abundance of alkaliphilous diatoms. All these changes are interpreted as variations in precipitation according to a previous model showing that pH is strongly controlled by acidic meteoric water. Inferred water depth slightly changed over the last 5500 years showing weak variations of precipitation minus <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance</b> at secular to millennial time scales. These results will be used to refine previously published paleoclimatic interpretations, which explained changes in precipitation and P-E balance by modifications in the vertical structure of the atmosphere and subsequently by changes in cloud cover, convective or stratiform...|$|E
40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{consensus}} among climatologist and oceanographers that the climate system has undergone rapid changes during the last decades of the 20 th century {{and the beginning of}} the 21 st. The most remarkable variation is the increase in temperature both in oceans and atmosphere. Ocean plays a key role to mitigate global warming since it absorbs the vast majority of the heat gained by the Earth. So, small changes in ocean`s properties can lead to unforeseeable consequences. Numerous studies showed that these variations are highly dependent on temporal and spatial scales, in such a way that changes are more marked at regional scale. The Bay of Biscay is a semi-enclosed sea located in the North Atlantic Ocean, off the north coast of Spain and the west coast of France. Its bathymetry is characterized by a wide continental shelf along the French coast, especially in its northern part (more than 100 km), and a narrower one along the Spanish coast. The Biscay Abyssal plain, with depths around 4000 m, occupies the central part of the bay. This area is influenced by the general circulation in the North Atlantic following an anticyclonic gyre. In the rest of the bay, bathymetric conditions together with local forcings (wind pattern, river discharges…) give as result a circulation pattern that changes depending on the season. So, the scientific interest of the Bay of Biscay resides in that it is a semi-enclosed sea representing a complex merger between ocean features and local processes that show their influence at different temporal and spatial scales. The main aim of this thesis is to analyze oceanic physical changes occurred in the Bay of Biscay during the last decades. To carry out this purpose the newest databases were selected in order to ensure appropriate spatial and temporal resolutions. Thus, insitu databases (Argo floats), satellite data (MODIS sensor) and reanalysis databases (SODA, OISST 1 / 4 and CFSR) were combined to analyze changes in salinity and temperature, as well as, variations in other physical variables such as mixed layer depth, for the whole Bay of Biscay. Thermohaline variability of the two main upper water masses, Eastern North Atlantic Central Water (ENACW) and Mediterranean Water (MW), were studied over the periods 1975 - 2010 and 2004 - 2013. ENACW has been observed to warm and salinificate over both periods, whilst a cooling and a freshening were detected for MW over the period 2004 - 2013. These variations were mainly due to changes in the región were both water masses originated. This fact was evidenced applying the methodology developed by Bindoff and McDougall (1994) and also analyzing air temperature trends and precipitation less <b>evaporation</b> <b>balance</b> trend in the Northeastern Atlantic. Wintertime MLD trends in the Bay of Biscay over the period 1975 – 2010 were calculated using a potential temperature criterion to define the isothermal layer depth and a potential density criterion to define the isopycnal layer depth. MLD tended to deepen at the southeastern corner and shallow at the rest of the bay. It was observed that air temperature trends play a key role to explain the different MLD trend pattern. Apart from changes in the mean values of thermohaline variables, variations in the seasonality and in the frequency of extreme hot SST days were also studied for the whole Bay of Biscay since 1982. Overall, a warming was detected in all months for the whole bay. This warming was higher during spring and autumn months. This fact led to an increase in the duration of the warm season in more than one month for most of the bay. In addition, an increase in the number of extreme hot SST days was detected during spring and autumn months, while no clear trend was observed during august, when the highest mean SST values occur. Finally, the influence of Loire and Gironde Rivers discharges over SST trends was nalyzed using reanalysis and satellite data. The oceanic area under the influence of the turbid plume is the only area of the bay where a cooling was detected during Winter months. In addition, it was concluded that river discharges and southwestern winds over their mean values favors the maintenance of the turbid plume and also the cooling in this area. So, river discharges in the Bay of Biscay can modulate the warming pattern. In conclusion, significant changes in physical properties and processes were detected in the Bay of Biscay during the last decades. The combination between ocean features and local processes, which show their influence at different temporal and spatial scales, explain these variations. This thesis evidences the importance of carrying out regional studies to understand physical changes in oceans, as well as to understand its influence on marine ecosystems in order to determine scenarios and policies to mitigate those changes...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{calculations}} of building heat loss via the ground, the coupling with soil moisture transfer is generally ignored, an important hypothesis {{which will be}} falsified in this paper. Results from coupled simulations – coupled soil heat and moisture transfer equations and complete surface heat and moisture balances – are compared to results from linear simulations. It is shown that the coupled calculations give notably higher heat losses. Surface temperature, the driving force for heat loss via the ground, is identified as a first important source for these deviations: it is shown that while the averages of the surface temperature are almost equal in coupled and linear calculations, the amplitude in the coupled simulation is considerably higher. A further study reveals that variation of the thermal properties with moisture content also contributes partially to the observed differences.

30|$|An {{overview}} of the temperature and precipitation in the two growing seasons is provided as supplementary information. Both environments had similar average temperatures, but the period of plant vegetative growth in the 2007 environment experienced less rainfall, more moisture evaporation, and half as many days with rain compared with the 2010 environment (Additional file 1 : Table S 2). Root systems were much less complex and had smaller stalks in the 2007 environment (Table  3), which had a large average water deficit. In the 2010 environment, the amount of rainfall and <b>evaporation</b> was <b>balanced.</b> Data collected from trials conducted in 2007 and 2010 for shoot phenotyping suggests a more nuanced interpretation, however. Based on contrasts of least square means of the inbreds and hybrids, plant height was greater in 2010 by 21.5  cm (± 1.4  cm) and flowering time was delayed by 12.2 – 12.5  days (± 0.2  days to anthesis/silking) compared with 2007. Despite the more favorable moisture conditions in 2010, the grain weight per ear was 31.2  g (± 2.4  g) greater in 2007. Mean heterosis was also significantly different between the environments for FA and RA (q ≤  0.01), with increased heterosis observed in 2010. Since the material evaluated is a selected set of germplasm, broad sense repeatabilities were calculated for the inbreds and F 1 s instead of heritabilities and provided in Additional file 1 : Table S 3. Repeatabilities for FD, FA, and RA among the inbreds were high (0.89, 0.87, 0.89), and greater {{than those of the}} F 1 s (0.67, 0.74, 0.78). Repeatabilities for SD among the inbreds and F 1 s were moderate (0.50, 0.39), but the 90 % confidence intervals were large, particularly for the inbreds. This variation is interpreted to be related to within-plot plant to plant variation for plant size based on observations during sampling.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{two aspects}} of a project designed to understand the liquid-vapor interface in microstructured heat exchangers. The two aspects include: design and fabrication of a custom vacuum chamber faceplate and {{the investigation of the}} liquid meniscus shape on microstructured devices. The faceplate for the vacuum chamber consisted of two metal components that serve to house and seal a viewport. Addition of the viewport to the chamber was of interest so that experimentation within a pure environment could be conducted. The second component of this project was to map the meniscus profile of water on three different device geometries under various conditions by laser interferometry. The first experiment was a transient study where a droplet of water fully evaporated from the surface. The purpose was to determine how the profile changes as evaporation progresses. As evaporation occurs a more curved meniscus is established within the liquid which causes a greater capillary pressure. The second experiment was a steady state study with the samples partially submerged in water. This aimed to determine the profile that arises when <b>evaporation</b> is <b>balanced</b> by fluid replenishment. The profile that arises after the first several microstructure unit cells remains constant {{for the remainder of the}} microstructured region of the sample and the meniscus has the highest curvature near the fluid front, indicating a higher capillary pressure. The final experiment was varying heat applied to the surface. The aim was to determine how the applied heat flux changes the steady state profile. With higher temperature more fluid evaporates from the surface, resulting in an increase of meniscus curvature with increased temperature. by Edgardo Farias. Thesis: S.

40|$|We {{quantified}} {{the following}} hydrological and meteorological components in a windward tropical montane cloud forest ecosystem near Monteverde, Costa Rica, during a three months field campaign in 2003 : fog water deposition, precipitation, throughfall, and stemflow. Additionally we determined the stabile isotope concentrations of 18 O and 2 H {{of a large}} number of samples from each component. Net fog water deposition was measured directly with the eddy covariance method. An average daily fog water deposition rate of 1. 2 mm was measured. Fog water deposition constituted 4 – 7 % of rainfall collected over the full period. Comparisons between direct fog water deposition measurements and the results of a mixing model using the stable isotopes as tracers revealed that the latter might be a good tool to estimate fog water deposition without an eddy covariance system in the future under many (but not all) conditions. To compute the wet-canopy water <b>balance,</b> <b>evaporation</b> from the wet canopy was calculated with the reduced Penman- Monteith equation. For a period of 65 2 days, we measured 506 mm of water input (fog and rain water) and 557 mm of water output (throughfall, stemflow, and wet-canopy evaporation). 1...|$|R
40|$|It is {{proposed}} {{to construct a}} demonstration Hot Dry Rock (HDR) geothermal plant {{in the vicinity of}} the City of Clearlake. An interim evaluation has been made of the availability of surface water to supply the plant. The evaluation has required consideration of the likely water consumption of such a plant. It has also required consideration of population, land, and water uses in the drainage basins adjacent to Clear Lake, where the HDR demonstration project is likely to be located. Five sources were identified that appear to be able to supply water of suitable quality in adequate quantity for initial filling of the reservoir, and on a continuing basis, as makeup for water losses during operation. Those sources are California Cities Water Company, a municipal supplier to the City of Clearlake; Clear Lake, controlled by Yolo County Flood Control and Water Conservation District; Borax Lake, controlled by a local developer; Southeast Regional Wastewater Treatment Plant, controlled by Lake County; and wells, ponds, and streams on private land. The evaluation involved the water uses, water rights, stream flows, precipitation, <b>evaporation,</b> a water <b>balance,</b> and water quality. In spite of California`s prolonged drought, the interim conclusion is that adequate water is available at a reasonable cost to supply the proposed HDR demonstration project...|$|R
40|$|The Baltic Sea Experiment BALTEX is the European {{regional}} {{project of}} GEWEX. The aim of BALTEX {{is to improve}} the knowledge of the water and energy cycle of the Baltic Sea including its catchment area (the BALTEX area). In this study the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis data (Kalnay et al. Bull. Am. Meteorol. Soc., 1996, 77, 437 – 471) are used to derive the mean atmospheric water budget over the BALTEX area. For this purpose the horizontal water vapour fluxes are calculated. In the long-term mean (here 1948 – 2000) the vertically integrated divergence of these fluxes must <b>balance</b> <b>evaporation</b> minus precipitation. The latter two are provided by the NCEP/NCAR reanalyses. The water budget over the BALTEX area is, however, not closed. An error estimation is performed. The divergence of the water vapour flux is corrected due to the mass balance correction technique (Alestalo, Tellus, 1981, 33, 360 – 371). Large differences are obtained between the precipitation given by the NCEP/NCAR reanalysis and by the analysis of the observations by Rubel and Hantel (Meteorol. Atmos. Phys., 2001, 77, 155 – 166). With these analysed precipitation data and the corrected divergence of the water vapour fluxes the imbalance of the water vapour budget could be remarkably reduced...|$|R

The tested null hypotheses were that there are no differences in solvent evaporation regardless of its formulation and over time. Evaporation from commercial adhesive systems (Scotchbond Multipurpose Primer, Scotchbond Multipurpose Adhesive, Prime & Bond NT, Multi Bond, Excite, Single Bond 2, Adhese Primer, Adhese Bond, Xeno III A and Xeno III B) and experimental primers (35 % HEMA plus 65 % acetone or ethanol or water v/v) were compared to neat solvents (acetone, ethanol and water). Samples (10 &# 181;L) of these products were dripped into glass containers placed on a digital precision <b>balance.</b> <b>Evaporation</b> was assessed at 0, 5, 10, 15, 30, 60, 120, 300 and 600 s times to calculate mass loss. Data were analyzed statistically by ANOVA and Bonferroni's correction (a= 0. 05). Acetone-based products exhibited a remarkable capacity to evaporate spontaneously over time. Neat acetone evaporated significantly more than the HEMA-mixtures and the commercial formulations (p< 0. 05). The incorporation of monomers and other ingredients in the commercial formulations seem to reduce the evaporation capacity. Solvent evaporation was time and material-dependent...|$|R
40|$|The Aral Sea is {{shrinking}} rapidly since the 1960 s {{mainly because of}} the diversion of the Amu Darya and Syr Darya rivers for irrigation purposes. Since then, the evaporation became the most important component of the water balance of the Sea and led to a concentration of the remaining salts. In this article, we investigate through a coupled mathematical model of water and salt balance of the Aral Sea, the dynamic evolution of the sea. The water balance considers river inflow, groundwater inflow, atmospheric precipitation and <b>evaporation.</b> The salt <b>balance</b> considers the dominant ions and the chemical precipitation of gypsum, epsomite and mirabilite. The evaporation rates are calculated with a modified Penman equation accounting for the salinity of the lake and using statistical climatic data. With this model, we obtain an estimate of the evaporation flux (between 1100 and more than 1200 mm/year depending on the salinity) larger than earlier estimates. The estimated groundwater discharge into the sea is also larger than earlier estimates and is highly variable from year to year. The last point is that the model is able to simulate rather well the evolution of the salinity until the 1980 s, but it does not reproduce accurately the chemical evolution of the lake during the most recent period and needs further improvements...|$|R
40|$|The Tibetan Plateau is {{the largest}} {{elevated}} landmass {{in the world and}} profoundly influences atmospheric circulation patterns such as the Asian monsoon system. Therefore this area has been increasingly in focus of palaeoenvironmental studies. This thesis evaluates the applicability of organic biomarkers for palaeolimnological purposes on the Tibetan Plateau with a focus on aquatic macrophyte-derived biomarkers. Submerged aquatic macrophytes have to be considered to significantly influence the sediment organic matter due to their high abundance in many Tibetan lakes. They can show highly 13 C-enriched biomass because of their carbon metabolism and it is therefore crucial for the interpretation of δ 13 C values in sediment cores to understand to which extent aquatic macrophytes contribute to the isotopic signal of the sediments in Tibetan lakes and in which way variations can be explained in a palaeolimnological context. Additionally, the high abundance of macrophytes makes them interesting as potential recorders of lake water δD. Hydrogen isotope analysis of biomarkers is a rapidly evolving field to reconstruct past hydrological conditions and therefore of special relevance on the Tibetan Plateau due to the direct linkage between variations of monsoon intensity and changes in regional precipitation / <b>evaporation</b> <b>balances.</b> A set of surface sediment and aquatic macrophyte samples from the central and eastern Tibetan Plateau was analysed for composition as well as carbon and hydrogen isotopes of n-alkanes. It was shown how variable δ 13 C values of bulk organic matter and leaf lipids can be in submerged macrophytes even of a single species and how strongly these parameters are affected by them in corresponding sediments. The estimated contribution of the macrophytes by means of a binary isotopic model was calculated to be up to 60 % (mean: 40 %) to total organic carbon and up to 100 % (mean: 66 %) to mid-chain n-alkanes. Hydrogen isotopes of n-alkanes turned out to record δD of meteoric water of the summer precipitation. The apparent enrichment factor between water and n-alkanes was in range of previously reported ones (≈- 130 ‰) at the most humid sites, but smaller (average: - 86 ‰) at sites with a negative moisture budget. This indicates an influence of evaporation and evapotranspiration on δD of source water for aquatic and terrestrial plants. The offset between δD of mid- and long-chain n-alkanes was close to zero in most of the samples, suggesting that lake water as well as soil and leaf water are affected to a similar extent by those effects. To apply biomarkers in a palaeolimnological context, the aliphatic biomarker fraction of a sediment core from Lake Koucha (34. 0 ° N; 97. 2 ° E; eastern Tibetan Plateau) was analysed for concentrations, δ 13 C and δD values of compounds. Before ca. 8 cal ka BP, the lake was dominated by aquatic macrophyte-derived mid-chain n-alkanes, while after 6 cal ka BP high concentrations of a C 20 highly branched isoprenoid compound indicate a predominance of phytoplankton. Those two principally different states of the lake were linked by a transition period with high abundances of microbial biomarkers. δ 13 C values were relatively constant for long-chain n-alkanes, while mid-chain n-alkanes showed variations between - 23. 5 to - 12. 6 ‰. Highest values were observed for the assumed period of maximum macrophyte growth during the late glacial and for the phytoplankton maximum during the middle and late Holocene. Therefore, the enriched values were interpreted to be caused by carbon limitation which in turn was induced by high macrophyte and primary productivity, respectively. Hydrogen isotope signatures of mid-chain n-alkanes {{have been shown to be}} able to track a previously deduced episode of reduced moisture availability between ca. 10 and 7 cal ka BP, indicated by a 20 ‰ shift towards higher δD values. Indications for cooler episodes at 6. 0, 3. 1 and 1. 8 cal ka BP were gained from drops of biomarker concentrations, especially microbial-derived hopanoids, and from coincidental shifts towards lower δ 13 C values. Those episodes correspond well with cool events reported from other locations on the Tibetan Plateau as well as in the Northern Hemisphere. To conclude, the study of recent sediments and plants improved the understanding of factors affecting the composition and isotopic signatures of aliphatic biomarkers in sediments. Concentrations and isotopic signatures of the biomarkers in Lake Koucha could be interpreted in a palaeolimnological context and contribute to the knowledge about the history of the lake. Aquatic macrophyte-derived mid-chain n-alkanes were especially useful, due to their high abundance in many Tibetan Lakes and their ability to record major changes of lake productivity and palaeo-hydrological conditions. Therefore, they have the potential to contribute to a fuller understanding of past climate variability in this key region for atmospheric circulation systems...|$|R

The study on vetiver potential for increasing groundwater recharge was conducted at Yom Watershed, Northern Thailand during 2004 - 05. Three agriculture sites were selected representing longan, maize and soybean cultivations while six runoff plots (4 x 20 m 2) were established within each selected site. Vetiver hedgerows were planted across the slope within three plots while the other three plots were left as control plots. Soil-water content was measured using TDR profile probe which access tubes were installed within each runoff plot. The 8 -inch standard rain gages and evaporation pans were also installed at each site to measure rainfall and <b>evaporation.</b> The water <b>balance</b> components were estimated using the integral form of the following equation: P = Rchg + Roff + ET + ∆θ where P is the rainfall; Rchg is the deep drainage; Roff is the surface runoff; ET is the evapotranspiration; ∆θ is the change in soil-water storage for a given profile. The results showed that runoff accounted for 3 - 13 % of rainfall at study sites while vetiver hedgerows reduced runoff by 19 - 56 %.

40|$|Evaporation {{rates were}} {{measured}} for an oligotrophic {{raised peat bog}} dominated by the restionaceous rush Empodisma minus (Hook. f.) Johnson and Cutler in northern New Zealand. Evaporation rates were smaller than those found for other wetlands, ranging between 0. 06 - 0. 16 mm h− 1 during the daytime, and the average latent heat flux accounted for only 23 % of net radiation. Daily average evaporation was only 34 % of the Penman potential open water rate, yet the soil was permanently close to saturation. Bowen ratios in the range 3 - 5 indicate that available energy is primarily partitioned into sensible heat by the dense plant canopy. Bowen ratios in this range are normally associated with semi-arid zone climates rather than with a permanently moist raised peat bog. According to the Penman-Monteith model, the conservative evaporation regime at this site {{is due to a}} very large canopy resistance, with daily averages in the range 150 - 608 s m− 1 when the canopy is dry. This large canopy resistance is probably the result of plant responses to a nutrient-poor environment, combined with the effect of an extremely dense canopy preventing the diffusion of water vapour from the moist peat substrate. Variations in canopy resistance behaviour are caused by variable degrees of canopy wetness for several days following rain. This behaviour poses difficulties for modelling <b>evaporation</b> in water <b>balance</b> studies, hence a simple scheme utilising the Penman potential open water evaporation is favoured...|$|R
