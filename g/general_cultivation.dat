In <b>general,</b> crop <b>cultivation</b> plays an integral part in the improvement of the Borana agro-pastoralists’ livelihoods, including increased feed availability for their livestock production and productivity. According to Adugna and Aster (2007), studies in the Dire District of Borana Zone showed that cultivated land, pastureland, and bush land cover 1.2 %, 27.5 %, and 33 % of the total land area of the district, respectively. Whereas the current status indicated that cultivated land accounts for 4.4 % of the total area of the districts (Figure  2). Similarly, in the Yabello District, the area covered by crop cultivation showed a slight difference in the years of 2011 / 2012 and 2012 / 2013. This finding is also supported by Coppock (1994).

This paper attempts to examine the instrumental role of credit in ensuring efficiency {{in the context of}} West Bengal agriculture by disaggregating the analysis for two mutually exclusive groups: bank customers and non-bank customers. Empirical analysis based on Stochastic Frontier Analysis confirms that farming households having access to formal credit are, in <b>general,</b> practicing <b>cultivation</b> more efficiently by channelizing credit in the utilization of agricultural inputs. In addition, contractual arrangements and operated farm size are found to be significant determinants of observed variation of technical efficiency estimates in case of bank customers.

Thus an access to institutional credit would provide an incentive to the farmers to adjust the operational land by the mechanism of tenurial contract so as to bring about efficiency in agricultural production...|$|R

60|$|I have dwelt on this point, {{as being}} a {{necessary}} part of a perfectly just conception of Utility or Happiness, considered as the directive rule of human conduct. But {{it is by no means}} an indispensable condition to the acceptance of the utilitarian standard; for that standard is not the agent's own greatest happiness, but the greatest amount of happiness altogether; and if it may possibly be doubted whether a noble character is always the happier for its nobleness, there can be no doubt that it makes other people happier, and that the world in general is immensely a gainer by it. Utilitarianism, therefore, could only attain its end by the <b>general</b> <b>cultivation</b> of nobleness of character, even if each individual were only benefited by the nobleness of others, and his own, so far as happiness is concerned, were a sheer deduction from the benefit.

The effect of mechanical cultivation on disease incidence was studied by surveying fields during the season and by determining the number and weight of diseased pods, roots and heads at harvest. The relationship between the level of Cercospora blight on carrots and potential impacts on yield was also investigated by measuring plant characteristics and the amount of force needed to separate carrot foliage from root.

Kiribati like other nations in the Pacific faces an urban future where food insecurity, unemployment, waste management and malnutrition will become increasing issues. Homegardening is suggested as one way to address many of these problems. However, the most recent study on agriculture production in urban centres in Kiribati shows that, in <b>general,</b> intensive <b>cultivation</b> of homegardens is not a common practice. This disparity between theory and practice creates an opportunity to re-examine homegardening in Kiribati and, more broadly in the Pacific. This paper examines the practice of homegardening in urban centres in Kiribati and explores reasons why change has or has not occurred through interviews with homegardeners and government/donor representatives. Results show that homegardening has increased significantly in the past five years, largely due to the promotion of homegardens and organic composting systems by donor organisations. While findings further endorse homegardening as an excellent theoretical solution to many of the problems that confront urban settlements in Kiribati and the Pacific it raises additional questions regarding the continuation of homegarden schemes beyond donor support programs.

Soil samples were taken from the layers 0 - 20 cm and 20 - 40 cm, and mango leaves were collected in the growth stage. Areas of native vegetation (Caatinga) adjacent to the cultivated areas were used for comparison. The total concentrations of heavy metals (Cu, Cr, Fe, Zn, Mn, Ni, and Pb) were determined in soils and leaves. In <b>general,</b> mango <b>cultivation</b> led to Cu and Zn accumulation in the soil surface and to a reduction in the contents of Ni, Pb, Mn, and Fe in surface and subsurface. Since contamination by Cu, Zn, and Cr was detected, these areas must be monitored to prevent negative environmental impacts. For instance, the presence of Cr in mango tree leaves indicates the need to investigate the source of the element in these orchards. The management strategies of the different companies led to deficiency or excess of some metals in the evaluated areas. However, the Fe and Mn levels were adequate for the mineral nutrition of mango in all areas...|$|R
60|$|The {{principle}} of utility either has, {{or there is}} no reason why it might not have, all the sanctions which belong to any other system of morals. Those sanctions are either external or internal. Of the external sanctions it is not necessary to speak at any length. They are, the hope of favour and the fear of displeasure from our fellow creatures or from the Ruler of the Universe, along with whatever we may have of sympathy or affection for them or of love and awe of Him, inclining us to do His will independently of selfish consequences. There is evidently no reason why all these motives for observance should not attach themselves to the utilitarian morality, as completely and as powerfully as to any other. Indeed, those of them which refer to our fellow creatures are sure to do so, in proportion to the amount of general intelligence; for whether there be any other ground of moral obligation than the general happiness or not, men do desire happiness; and however imperfect may be their own practice, they desire and commend all conduct in others towards themselves, by which they think their happiness is promoted. With regard to the religious motive, if men believe, as most profess to do, in the goodness of God, those who think that conduciveness to the general happiness is the essence, or even only the criterion, of good, must necessarily believe that it is also that which God approves. The whole force therefore of external reward and punishment, whether physical or moral, and whether proceeding from God or from our fellow men, together with all that the capacities of human nature admit, of disinterested devotion to either, become available to enforce the utilitarian morality, in proportion as that morality is recognized; and the more powerfully, the more the appliances of education and <b>general</b> <b>cultivation</b> are bent to the purpose.|$|E

In spite of his gray head and wrinkled brow, he was quite like a child in all matters save what had some reference to his own business; he seemed, unless my fancy misled me, to view mankind in no other relation than as people in want of tombstones, and his literary attainments evidently comprehended very little either of prose of poetry which had not at one time or other been inscribed on slate or marble. His sole task and office among the immortal pilgrims of the tomb--the duty for which Providence had sent the old man into the world, as it were with a chisel in his hand--was to label the dead bodies, lest their names should be forgotten at the resurrection. Yet he had not failed, within a narrow scope, to gather a few sprigs of earthly, and more than earthly, wisdom--the harvest of many a grave. And, lugubrious as his calling might appear, he was as cheerful an old soul as health and integrity and lack of care could make him, and used to set to work upon one sorrowful inscription or another with that sort of spirit which impels a man to sing at his labor.

60|$|And {{this change}} of feeling {{involves}} two others, very important. When {{the flowers and}} grass were regarded as means of life, and therefore (as the thoughtful laborer of the soil must always regard them) with the reverence due to those gifts of God which were most necessary to his existence; although their own beauty was less felt, their proceeding from the Divine hand was more seriously acknowledged, and the herb yielding seed, and fruit-tree yielding fruit, though in themselves less admired, were yet solemnly connected in the heart with the reverence of Ceres, Pomona, or Pan. But when the sense of these necessary uses {{was more or less}} lost, among the upper classes, by the delegation of the art of husbandry to the hands of the peasant, the flower and fruit, whose bloom or richness thus became a mere source of pleasure, were regarded with less solemn sense of the Divine gift in them; and were converted rather into toys than treasures, chance gifts for gaiety, rather than promised rewards of labor; so that while the Greek could hardly have trodden the formal furrow, or plucked the clusters from the trellised vine, without reverent thoughts of the deities of field and leaf, who gave the seed to fructify, and the bloom to darken, the mediæval knight plucked the violet to wreathe in his lady's hair, or strewed the idle rose on the turf at her feet, with little sense of anything in the nature that gave them, but a frail, accidental, involuntary exuberance; while also the Jewish sacrificial system being now done away, as well as the Pagan mythology, and, with it, the whole conception of meat offering or firstfruits offering, the chiefest seriousness of all the thoughts connected with the gifts of nature faded from the minds of the classes of men concerned with art and literature; while the peasant, reduced to serf level, was incapable of imaginative thought, owing to his want of <b>general</b> <b>cultivation.</b> But on the other hand, exactly in proportion as the idea of definite spiritual presence in material nature was lost, the mysterious sense of unaccountable life in the things themselves would be increased, and the mind would instantly be laid open to all those currents of fallacious, but pensive and pathetic sympathy, which we have seen to be characteristic of modern times.|$|E

60|$|In {{considering}} these questions, {{two points}} require an equal degree of our attention: how the local business {{itself can be}} best done, and how its transaction can be made most instrumental to the nourishment of public spirit {{and the development of}} intelligence. In an earlier part of this inquiry I have dwelt in strong language--hardly any language is strong enough to express the strength of my conviction--on the importance of that portion of the operation of free institutions which may be called the public education of the citizens. Now of this operation the local administrative institutions are the chief instrument. Except by the part they may take as jurymen in the administration of justice, the mass of the population have very little opportunity of sharing personally in the conduct of the general affairs of the community. Reading newspapers, and perhaps writing to them, public meetings, and solicitations of different sorts addressed to the political authorities, are the extent of the participation of private citizens in general politics during the interval between one Parliamentary election and another. Though it is impossible to exaggerate the importance of these various liberties, both as securities for freedom and as means of <b>general</b> <b>cultivation,</b> the practice which they give is more in thinking than in action, and in thinking without the responsibilities of action, which with most people amounts to little more than passively receiving the thoughts of some one else. But in the case of local bodies, besides the function of electing, many citizens in turn have the chance of being elected, and many, either by selection or by rotation, fill one or other of the numerous local executive offices. In these positions they have to act for public interests, as well as to think and to speak, and the thinking can not all be done by proxy. It may be added that these local functions, not being in general sought by the higher ranks, carry down the important political education which they are the means of conferring to a much lower grade in society. The mental discipline being thus a more important feature in local concerns than in the general affairs of the state, while there are not such vital interests dependent {{on the quality of the}} administration, a greater weight may be given to the former consideration, and the latter admits much more frequently of being postponed to it than in matters of general legislation and the conduct of imperial affairs.|$|E
60|$|It is in {{the fine}} arts, {{properly}} so called, that the primâ facie evidence of inferior original powers in women at first sight appears the strongest: since opinion (it may be said) does not exclude them from these, but rather encourages them, and their education, instead of passing over this department, {{is in the}} affluent classes mainly composed of it. Yet in this line of exertion they have fallen still more short than in many others, of the highest eminence attained by men. This shortcoming, however, needs no other explanation than the familiar fact, more universally true in the fine arts than in anything else; the vast superiority of professional persons over amateurs. Women in the educated classes are almost universally taught more or less of some branch or other of the fine arts, but not that they may gain their living or their social consequence by it. Women artists are all amateurs. The exceptions are only of the kind which confirm the general truth. Women are taught music, {{but not for the}} purpose of composing, only of executing it: and accordingly it is only as composers, that men, in music, are superior to women. The only one of the fine arts which women do follow, to any extent, as a profession, and an occupation for life, is the histrionic; and in that they are confessedly equal, if not superior, to men. To make the comparison fair, it should be made between the productions of women in any branch of art, and those of men not following it as a profession. In musical composition, for example, women surely have produced fully as good things as have ever been produced by male amateurs. There are now a few women, a very few, who practise painting as a profession, and these are already beginning to show quite as much talent as could be expected. Even male painters (pace Mr. Ruskin) have not made any very remarkable figure these last centuries, and it will be long before they do so. The reason why the old painters were so greatly superior to the modern, is that a greatly superior class of men applied themselves to the art. In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Italian painters were the most accomplished men of their age. The greatest of them were men of encyclopædical acquirements and powers, like the great men of Greece. But in their times fine art was, to men's feelings and conceptions, among the grandest things in which a human being could excel; and by it men were made, what only political or military distinction now makes them, the companions of sovereigns, and the equals of the highest nobility. In the present age, men of anything like similar calibre find something more important to do, for their own fame and the uses of the modern world, than painting: and it is only now and then that a Reynolds or a Turner (of whose relative rank among eminent men I do not pretend to an opinion) applies himself to that art. Music belongs to a different order of things; it does not require the same general powers of mind, but seems more dependant on a natural gift: and it may be thought surprising that no one of the great musical composers has been a woman. But even this natural gift, to be made available for great creations, requires study, and professional devotion to the pursuit. The only countries which have produced first-rate composers, even of the male sex, are Germany and Italy--countries in which, both in point of special and of <b>general</b> <b>cultivation,</b> women have remained far behind France and England, being generally (it may be said without exaggeration) very little educated, and having scarcely cultivated at all any of the higher faculties of mind. And in those countries the men who are acquainted with the principles of musical composition must be counted by hundreds, or more probably by thousands, the women barely by scores: so that here again, on the doctrine of averages, we cannot reasonably expect to see more than one eminent woman to fifty eminent men; and the last three centuries have not produced fifty eminent male composers either in Germany or in Italy.|$|E

The micronutrient deficiencies in soil are not only hamper crop productivity but also deteriorating the produce quality. World health organization (WHO) has estimated that over 3 billion people in the globe suffer from the micronutrient malnutrition and about 2 billion people of these have iron deficiency. Iron is one of the 16 essential elements needed for plant growth. Iron is used for the synthesis of chlorophyll and is essential for the function of chloroplasts. Zinc is involved in membrane integrity, enzyme activation, and gene expression. Rice, sorghum and corn are Zn sensitive and sorghum, sugarcane, groundnut, soyabean, beans, grapes, vegetables and citrus are highly Fe sensitive crops. To overcome these problems foliar spray is being recommended but it is not crop specific or soil specific recommendation. Keeping these problems in the view, recently development of micronutrient efficient genotypes, creating awareness of micronutrient dose, crop specific micronutrient uptake and accumulation are vital to improve productivity and to address human health problems. In this paper we discussed the importance of iron and zinc in agriculture and their role in crop plants and ways to improve the crop productivity as well as human health...|$|R

Medical science is a fast changing field. In fact, the whole concept of diagnosing and treating a patient is modifying rapidly and hospitals of the future will treat patients {{from all over the world}} without geographical limitations. It is well said that from the elite class to the <b>general</b> masses, the <b>cultivation</b> of the righteous life is the foundation for all [1]. The library plays a vital role in the teaching and learning environment. Technology is changing the very nature of libraries. This has resulted in digitization. Digital and virtual libraries, which play an important role in e-learning, are fast emerging as a result of integration of varied technologies [2]. The role of the health science library is to provide a learning center where practitioners and administrators can develop the skills and knowledge needed to enhance the quality of health care in diverse communities and dissemination of biomedical information. Health science libraries can provide a multidisciplinary approach, which incorporate...|$|R

There are a lot of discussions about whether a Jatropha production and utility can be beneficial for a sustainable development in the developing countries, or if it’s just another cash crop for oil-export to the developed countries biofuel use. The content of this thesis is a determination of the possible livelihood impacts from a jatropha production, through a case in Zambia where 25. 000 small-scale farmers are involved in a jatropha production, aiming at a domestic sale of biofuel from the investment company Marli Investment. The analysis in the thesis is build up around different livelihood indicators such as, natural, social, economic and human assets; which simultaneously facilitate in showing how the livelihood of the small-scale farmers could get inflicted – positive as negative from a jatropha production. The findings in the analysis and the <b>general</b> knowledge about <b>cultivation,</b> use and production of the jatropha tree, drawn up recommendations for how a jatropha production can be started with benefits for the local livelihood of small-scale farmers and the development in the local society...|$|R
40|$|Agriculture is the {{backbone}} of Indian Economy. Because without agriculture living is impossible since agriculture produces {{the main source of}} food for us. But in today’s situation the availability of labour for carrying out agricultural activities is rare. The automation in all kind of industries leads to industrial growth. Here agricultural process is automated. In this proposed system all the machines to work on its own with the help of inputs received from the sensors which are monitoring the agricultural land round the clock and a single person is enough to monitor whether everything going normal. The entire process is controlled and monitored by programmable logic controller. Above process is transmitted to the user using ZigBee network. Agricultural process involves seeding, ploughing, irrigation, planting, fertilizing, weeding, harvesting. Here three processes can be implemented. The main objective is even a professionals can work in the agricultural field. This idea is implemented in future there is remarkable change in the agricultural field. In <b>general</b> the manual <b>cultivation</b> for one acre of land requires money of around Rs. 15, 000 - 17, 000 but due to this technique we reduce the cost and is nearly Rs. 9, 000 - 10, 000 only and also the yield is high when compared to normal one...|$|R
