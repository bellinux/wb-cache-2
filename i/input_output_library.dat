Currently the project has two main libraries: PortAudio, for digital audio <b>input</b> and <b>output,</b> and PortMidi, a library for MIDI <b>input</b> and <b>output.</b> A <b>library</b> for dealing with different audio file formats, PortSoundFile, is being planned, although another library, libsndfile, already exists and is licensed under the copyleft GNU Lesser General Public License.

40|$|The {{national}} standards for public libraries were first published by the American Library Association in 1933 and were revised approximately once a decade in 1943, 1956, and 1966. The standards placed significant influences {{on the development of}} American public libraries. However, development of these {{national standards}} was ceased by the Public Library Association (division of the ALA) in 1966 due to the new trend from the beginning of 1970 s to value the planning process of individual libraries, which encourages public libraries to develop and implement individual plans based on needs of the local community. The outcome of this trend was the Public Library Mission Statement which was adopted by PLA in 1979. These changes indicate the transformation from the <b>input</b> to <b>output</b> model <b>library</b> as well as from national standards to local standards based on the community needs. Furthermore, this shift continues with an increasing emphasis on the measurement of the effectiveness of library services. The present paper offers a new perspective for implementing public library standards in Japan and China by examining the transformation of American public library standards...|$|R
40|$|This study {{assesses the}} {{relative}} efficiency of public library services {{by examining the}} relationship between <b>library</b> <b>inputs</b> and <b>library</b> <b>outputs</b> in multi-outlet <b>library</b> systems. Differences {{in the size of}} the area and population served are reflected in differences in the number of outlets and mix of outlet types. Using a Data Envelopment Analysis, which controls for the accessibility of library resources, this study derives technical and overall efficiency scores for 99 UK Public Library Systems. The data are survey observations for 1995 / 1996. Over the decade leading up to the survey, library services had been subject to a protracted period of budget restraint and contraction in most areas of activity. The distribution of efficiency scores is skewed, implying that although many library systems are efficient or near-efficient, there is a tail of inefficient operations. Inefficiency is mainly, but not exclusively associated with over subscription to serial publications. Many library systems are scale inefficient, operating under conditions of increasing returns to scale. Reorganization of the service may be required if greater efficiency is to be achieved. ...|$|R

Laspeyres, Paasche, Fisher Ideal, and Törnqvist-Theil index number procedures (base year 1949 = 100) were used to develop their estimates, the formulas for which are presented below and elaborated further in Alston, Norton, and Pardey (1995). An Excel spreadsheet file named accompanies these notes. It contains the price and quantity <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> aggregates for each of the 48 contiguous states, 11 USDA production regions (with the Northeast region split into two sub-regions), and a 48 -state (national) total for the period 1949 - 91. The data file also includes various <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> subaggregates (see table 1 from Acquaye, Alston, and Pardey, appended below, for details) and the value shares using prices from the current and past period that are required to reconstruct all these indexes for all the spatial units reported in the paper. Documentation of the primary data files constructed by Craig, Pardey, and Acquaye is also available in the file named Index Number Construction The Laspeyres and Paasche indexes are not chain-linked indexes—they use base-period and current prices and quantities, respectively in the calculation. The Laspeyres <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantity index uses base period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> prices to weight both current and base-period <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> quantities, and was calculated as where Pi 0 is the price of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period, and Qi 0 is the quantity of <b>input</b> (<b>output)</b> i in the base-period.

30|$|As a conclusion, our {{proposed}} approach {{suggests an}} efficient alternative procedure to estimate predicted intervals for FR model with fuzzy <b>input</b> and <b>output.</b> As {{a limitation of}} our study, we only focused on fuzzy regression model in the case that <b>input</b> and <b>output</b> {{are assumed to be}} symmetric or nonsymmetric triangular fuzzy numbers. Therefore, we only considered FRBF Network when <b>input,</b> <b>output</b> and weights are triangular fuzzy numbers and we did not consider another types of fuzzy numbers in this study. Although the discussion of this study is confined to simple regression with one <b>input</b> and one <b>output,</b> it can be generalized to cope with cases of multiple <b>inputs</b> and <b>outputs.</b> For future studies, more general fuzzy <b>inputs,</b> <b>outputs</b> and weights such as trapezoidal fuzzy numbers could be handled with our FRBF Network approach and it could be applied to different FR models.|$|R

In newer variants (like the slim edition), the interface would however offer vastly more bandwidth than what is required by the PlayStation's <b>input</b> <b>output</b> devices as the HDD support was removed and the PCMCIA connector design was abandoned in favor of a slimmer design.|$|R

40|$|The current {{costs of}} drug {{discovery}} are extremely high {{and need to}} be addressed if diseases such as AIDS and malaria are to be combated. The major reasons for the high costs are the use of expensive in vitro methods and the high failure rate of drugs at clinical testing phases. In silico techniques hold tremendous potential in addressing the high costs. In silico drug design can be done {{at a fraction of the}} cost of in vitro techniques, and can be used in synergy with in vitro techniques by doing much of the screening before any experimental studies, thereby reducing the chemical space to be searched experimentally. In silico techniques can also enhance the quality of drug candidates sent to clinical phases, increasing the probability of success. In this study techniques were investigated to build analogous ligand libraries with scaffolds and molecular building blocks through a user guided process, including the development of the LIGLIB program, which is an Open Source package for lead development. The Markush molecular enumeration technique was implemented in C++ with a Python front-end extending it to the Python molecular visualization tool, Chimera. The software makes use of chemical graphs to make permutations according to user <b>inputs,</b> generating an <b>output</b> <b>library</b> in SMILES and Mol 2 format, the later of which is generated by Corina. As part of the validation of the software it was used in a lead discovery experiment which targeted Plasmodium falciparum Glutathione S-transferase. The developed software was able to generate a series of suitable molecules, thereby validating the Markush molecular enumeration technique as well as its implementation in LIGLIB.
