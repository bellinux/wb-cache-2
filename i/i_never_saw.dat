5|$|The {{order and}} {{regularity}} that prevailed on board, {{from the moment}} the ship struck till she totally disappeared, far exceeded anything that I had thought could be effected by the best discipline; and it is the more to be wondered at seeing that most of the soldiers were but a short time in the service. Everyone did as he was directed and there was not a murmur or cry amongst them until the ship made her final plunge – all received their orders and carried them out as if they were embarking instead of going to the bottom – <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any embarkation conducted with so little noise or confusion.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> {{him make}} an uneducated stroke. When he misjudged {{the nature of}} a ball he could, {{naturally}} enough, make the wrong right stroke. He not only enlarged and subtilised the art of batsmanship; he, like W.G. widened and strengthened cricket's appeal and history.|$|E
25|$|When Birt gets up {{and says}} {{the whole of the}} BBC was a {{creative}} mess and it was wasteful, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> any evidence of that. I absolutely know it wasn't so in my time. Producers now spend all their time worrying about money, and the thing has suffered for it.|$|E

England had a grievance, without a doubt.|$|E
25|$|After Walters's innings I {{wrote that}} with one {{necessary}} qualification I {{thought he would}} be come to be rated as the best bat produced by Australia since Neil Harvey proclaimed himself with his famous hundred at Headingley in 48. The reservation concerned his ability against really fast bowling, as to which I had no evidence...Only Lawry and Simpson have made more runs and had records to compare if one is to make a quantitative judgement. Any all events my contention is at least arguable. Doug has made eleven hundreds for Australia, some of extreme brilliance, and if he ever played a dull innings <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> it.|$|E

25|$|By {{the end of}} September 1957, {{the nine}} were {{admitted}} to Little Rock Central High {{under the protection of}} the 101st Airborne Division (and later the Arkansas National Guard), but they were still subjected to a year of physical and verbal abuse (being spat on and called names) by many of the white students. Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here. Won't you go to lunch with me today?' <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> her again.|$|E

It's like <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anything at all before. It's like I am filling up, like a wine-glass when it's filled with wine. I watch the acts before her and they are like nothing—they're like dust. Then she walks on the stage and—she is so pretty; and her suit is so nice; and her voice is so sweet... She makes me want to smile and weep, at once... <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a girl like her before. I never knew that there were girls like her.|$|E

Five American pilots returning from missions to hunt down the Japanese fleet were mistakenly shot down by Ford Island anti-aircraft gunners while attempting to land.

500|$|Secretariat {{grew into}} a massive, {{powerful}} horse said to resemble his sire's maternal grandsire, Discovery. He stood [...] when fully grown. He was noted for being exceptionally well-balanced, a big, powerful horse described as having [...] "nearly perfect" [...] conformation and stride biomechanics. His chest was so large that he required a custom-made girth, and he was noted for his large, powerful, well-muscled hindquarters. An Australian trainer said of him, [...] "He is incredible, an absolutely perfect horse. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anything like him." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Vanderbilt's only blemish was {{fighting}} defending national champion Yale to a scoreless tie. Team captain Bill Neely, recalling the tie with Yale said: [...] "The score {{tells the story}} a good deal better than I can. All I {{want to say is}} that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> a football team fight any harder at every point than Vanderbilt fought today – line, ends, and backfield. We went in to give Yale the best we had and I think we about did it." [...] The team was led by third-team Walter Camp All-American guard Will Metzger, and piloted by Morrison.|$|E

500|$|Kim Novak, {{who worked}} on Hitchcock's 1957 Vertigo, disputed Hedren's (and the film's) view of the director. Novak told The Daily Telegraph, [...] "I feel bad about all the stuff people are saying about him now, {{that he was a}} weird character. I did not find him to be weird at all. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him make a pass at anybody or act strange to anybody." [...] Louise Latham, who played Hedren's mother in Marnie, {{dismissed}} claims of Hitchcock's predatory nature in Broadcast magazine: [...] "I find some of the allegations hard to believe...I wasn't aware of her being hassled on the set." ...|$|E
500|$|Due to the {{enormous}} labor involved in sewing each ostrich feather to the dress, Astaire — who normally approved his partner's gowns and suggested modifications if necessary during rehearsals — saw the dress {{for the first time}} on the day of the shoot, and was horrified at the way it shed clouds of feathers at every twist and turn, recalling later: [...] "It was like a chicken attacked by a coyote, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> so many feathers in my life." [...] According to choreographer Hermes Pan, Astaire lost his temper and yelled at Rogers, who promptly burst into tears, whereupon her mother, Lela, [...] "came charging at him like a mother rhinoceros protecting her young." ...|$|E
500|$|Morrison {{returned}} to the A studios between June and August to record the remaining six tracks that featured on the album. For this second session Dahaud Shaar filled the role of engineer, though Shaar did not remember Morrison giving the job to him: [...] "Elliot {{thought he was going}} to be the co-producer, but then again <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him calling takes or asking people to change parts ... I didn't consider myself co-producer. Van would ask me questions and I would give him answers, but it was never a defined role." [...] Morrison felt unsatisfied with some of the final recordings, and notably reworked the song [...] "Street Choir" [...] shortly before studio work concluded.|$|E
6000|$|... "'Mr. Bridger,' said he, 'I'm a Kentuckian, and I've seen a {{great deal}} of both men and animals. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> yet <b>saw</b> a man that was overfond of horses and dogs but what was cruel to women.'" ...|$|R

500|$|By autumn 1974, Drake's weekly {{retainer}} from Island had ceased, and {{his illness}} meant {{he remained in}} contact {{with only a few}} close friends. He had tried {{to stay in touch with}} Sophia Ryde, whom he had first met in London in 1968. Ryde has been described by Drake's biographers as [...] "the nearest thing" [...] to a girlfriend in his life, but she now prefers the description [...] "best (girl) friend". In a 2005 interview, Ryde revealed that a week before he died, she had sought to end the relationship: [...] "I couldn't cope with it. I asked him for some time. And <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> him again." [...] As with the relationship he had earlier shared with fellow folk musician Linda Thompson, Drake's relationship with Ryde was never consummated.|$|E

500|$|Sullivan {{loved to}} spend time in France (both in Paris and the south of France), where his acquaintances {{included}} European royalty and where the casinos enabled him to indulge his passion for gambling. He enjoyed hosting private dinners and entertainments at his home, often featuring famous singers and well-known actors. In 1865 he was initiated into Freemasonry and was Grand Organist of the United Grand Lodge of England in 1887 during Queen Victoria's Golden Jubilee. Sullivan's talent and native charm gained him the friendship of many not only in the musical establishment, such as Grove, Chorley, and Herman Klein, but also in society circles, such as Alfred, Duke of Edinburgh. Sullivan enjoyed playing tennis although, according to George Grossmith, [...] "I have seen some bad lawn-tennis players in my time, but <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anyone so bad as Arthur Sullivan".|$|E
