5|$|Voyager 1 was {{constructed}} by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory. It has 16 hydrazine thrusters, three-axis stabilization gyroscopes, and referencing <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> keep the probe's radio antenna pointed toward Earth. Collectively, these instruments {{are part of the}} Attitude and Articulation Control Subsystem (AACS), along with redundant units of most instruments and 8 backup thrusters. The spacecraft also included 11 scientific <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> study celestial objects such as planets as it travels through space.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to the T/S, the TC's gimbal is pitched up 30 degrees from the lateral axis. This causes the <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> respond to roll as well as yaw. This allows the <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> display a change more quickly as it will react to the change in roll before the aircraft has even begun to yaw. Although this <b>instrument</b> reacts <b>to</b> changes in the aircraft's roll, it does not display the roll attitude.|$|R

Because {{the crisis was}} transmitted primarily by trade and financial flows impact of crisis is different among the countries. From one side developed countries implemented different <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> mitigate the effects, developing countries and transition countries are seriously affected with circumstances of financial effects. No one country funds the real <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> protect and escape the causes in economic and financial sector. What swaps allowed many governments to do was <b>to</b> replace any <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> other. But, what about gold reserves as one of <b>instrument</b> <b>to</b> confronted with financial crisis? Does the gold asset can improve and protect the financial turbulences in this and other derogation of financial market. Deeping financial analysis concludes that gold, with its lack of credit risk and liquid market, {{is one of the}} most attractive assets in diversification process. Key words: foreign exchange reserves, global financial crisis, gold reserve...|$|R

5|$|As the {{electric}} telegraph network expanded, {{allowing for the}} more rapid dissemination of warnings, a national observational network was developed, which could then be used to provide synoptic analyses. <b>Instruments</b> <b>to</b> continuously record variations in meteorological parameters using photography were supplied to the observing stations from Kew Observatory – these cameras had been invented by Francis Ronalds in 1845 and his barograph had earlier been used by FitzRoy.|$|E
5|$|Italian opera became {{immensely popular}} in the 19th century and was known across even the most rural {{sections}} of the country. Most villages had occasional opera productions, and the techniques used in opera influenced rural folk musics. Opera spread through itinerant ensembles and brass bands, focused in a local village. These civic bands (banda communale) used <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> perform operatic arias, with trombones or fluegelhorns for male vocal parts and cornets for female parts.|$|E

5|$|Taborn prefers earlier {{models of}} Fender Rhodes, for their raunchier sound. He also {{attempts}} to retain {{control over the}} sound that is presented to an audience when playing electronic instruments: he links his <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> his own amplifier, and then has the venue take its feed from that amplifier.|$|E
5|$|The {{challenge}} is to support biofuel development, including {{the development of new}} cellulosic technologies, with responsible policies and economic <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> help ensure that biofuel commercialization is sustainable. Responsible commercialization of biofuels represents an opportunity to enhance sustainable economic prospects in Africa, Latin America and Asia.|$|E
5|$|The mission {{added two}} new <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> Hubble. The first instrument, the Cosmic Origins Spectrograph, {{is now the}} most {{sensitive}} ultraviolet spectrograph installed on the telescope. Its far-UV channel is 30 times more sensitive than previous instruments and the near-UV is twice as sensitive. The second instrument, the Wide Field Camera 3, is a panchromatic wide-field camera that can record {{a wide range of}} wavelengths, including infrared, visible, and ultraviolet light. Atlantis also carried the Soft-Capture Mechanism, which was installed onto the telescope.|$|E

5|$|These {{ideas are}} {{reflected}} in the arrangement and composition of the album, which lead to a sound of dread and dissonance. The band used a number of less common <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> achieve this sound; in addition to the orchestra and choir, Neon Bible features a hurdy-gurdy, mandolin, accordion and pipe organ. Win Butler has said that in conceiving the album he hoped for a more stripped-down sound but the songs demanded further instrumentation.|$|E
5|$|Unlike their {{previous}} albums, Daft Punk recruited session musicians to perform live instrumentation and limited {{the use of}} electronic <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> drum machines, a custom-built modular synthesizer, and vintage vocoders. The album features collaborations with Giorgio Moroder, Panda Bear, Julian Casablancas, Todd Edwards, DJ Falcon, Chilly Gonzales, Nile Rodgers, Paul Williams and Pharrell Williams. It is the first Daft Punk album released by Columbia Records.|$|E
5|$|Although Sumerian and Babylonian artists mainly {{depicted}} ceremonial instruments, {{historians have}} been able to distinguish six idiophones used in early Mesopotamia: concussion clubs, clappers, sistra, bells, cymbals, and rattles. Sistra are depicted prominently in a great relief of Amenhotep III, and are of particular interest because similar designs have been found in far-reaching places such as Tbilisi, Georgia and among the Native American Yaqui tribe. The people of Mesopotamia preferred stringed <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> any other, as evidenced by their proliferation in Mesopotamian figurines, plaques, and seals. Innumerable varieties of harps are depicted, as well as lyres and lutes, the forerunner of modern stringed instruments such as the violin.|$|E

5|$|Amundsen did not {{publicise}} {{his change}} of plan. As Scott's biographer David Crane points out, the expedition's {{public and private}} funding was earmarked for scientific work in the Arctic; there was {{no guarantee that the}} backers would understand or agree to the proposed volte-face. Furthermore, the altered objective might cause Nansen to revoke the use of Fram, or parliament to halt the expedition for fear of undermining Scott and offending the British. Amundsen concealed his intentions from everyone except his brother Leon and his second-in-command, Nilsen. This secrecy led to awkwardness; Scott had sent Amundsen <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> enable their two expeditions, at opposite ends of the earth, to make comparative readings. When Scott, in Norway to test his motor sledges, telephoned Amundsen's home to discuss cooperation, the Norwegian would not take the call.|$|E
5|$|Both were arrested, with Lennon {{pleading}} guilty to hashish possession, absolving Ono, who miscarried not long after. Lennon was fined £150 ($360). Note: in November1973, Pilcher was arrested for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice after it was alleged he had committed perjury. He was {{convicted and sentenced to}} four years imprisonment. After the raid, the landlord sought an injunction against Starr on 19February1969, forbidding anyone but Starr or his family to live there, and allowing no music or <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> be played. Starr appealed, and a compromise was offered; only Starr or a family member would live in the flat. To finally settle the case, Starr sold the lease on 28February1969.|$|E

5|$|During the Classical and Romantic {{periods of}} music, lasting from roughly 1750 to 1900, {{a great deal}} of musical {{instruments}} capable of producing new timbres and higher volume were developed and introduced into popular music. The design changes that broadened the quality of timbres allowed <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> produce a wider variety of expression. Large orchestras rose in popularity and, in parallel, the composers determined to produce entire orchestral scores that made use of the expressive abilities of modern instruments. Since instruments were involved in collaborations of a much larger scale, their designs had to evolve to accommodate the demands of the orchestra.|$|E
5|$|During the {{following}} four weeks, while the ship was dry-docked, Bruce negotiated with the Argentine government {{over the future of}} the weather station. He was assisted by the British resident minister, the British Consul, and Dr W. G. Davis who was director of the Argentine Meteorological Office. When contacted by cable, the British Foreign Office registered no objection to this scheme. On 20 January 1904, Bruce confirmed an agreement whereby three scientific assistants of the Argentine government would travel back to Laurie Island to work for a year, under Robert Mossman, as the first stage of an annual arrangement. He then formally handed over the Omond House building, its furnishings and provisions, and all magnetic and meteorological <b>instruments,</b> <b>to</b> the Argentine government. The station, renamed Orcadas Base, has remained operational ever since, having been rebuilt and extended several times.|$|E
5|$|Following most {{present day}} {{damaging}} earthquakes, teams of investigators from {{institutions such as}} the Earthquake Engineering Research Institute are sent to the affected region to set up <b>instruments</b> <b>to</b> capture strong motion records, and to study the damage and other effects of the event. This has not always been the case, and the 1954 report from Steinbrugge and Moran that thoroughly detailed the effects (especially to buildings) of the 1952 shocks put in place a model for how modern earthquake reconnaissance reports are written. The strong motion record that was obtained from the 1952 shock, as well as the accelerogram from the 1940 El Centro earthquake, were the most widely used data sets until the 1971 San Fernando earthquake.|$|E
