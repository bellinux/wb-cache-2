Because it offered its <b>employees</b> a <b>profit-sharing</b> plan, and not a retirement fund, under the Federal Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) pension plan law, the trustee was under no obligation to diversify the fund. Because of the nondiversification and continued purchase of Carter Hawley Hale stock, the employee fund soon was stuck with a precipitous loss in value. Its employees’ low morale contributed to its problems.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyse {{environmental}} investments made between 1996 and 2008 by two hundred Brazilian firms. The study uses traditional techniques to establish the representativeness and importance of the variables and the extent of correlations between them.

However, no significant correlation between environmental investments and profitability was found.

40|$|Abstract: W e {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} pay, supervision and employee sharing. Our results suggest an inverse relationship between supervision and pay across both sharing and non-sharing firms, although the trade-off is somewhat assuaged within the former. This would appear to contradict instrumental efficiency wage considerations, but could be rationalised within a gift-exchange context. In terms of specific sharing schemes, {{it would seem that}} employee share ownership plans are relatively more successful in alleviating the need to monitor, with higher rates of profit sharing inducing more, rather than less, supervision K ey W ords: M onitoring, supervision, <b>profit-sharing,</b> <b>employee</b> share ownership; efficiency wages.

50|$|After Arcelor {{initially}} {{presented a}} hostile bid of $56 per share, ThyssenKrupp and Dofasco signalled their intentions {{to enter into}} a friendly merger. Under that plan, Dofasco would have retained its <b>employee</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> plan and placed in charge of all of ThyssenKrupp's North American operations. Arcelor raised its offer significantly, causing ThyssenKrupp to pull out as further bidding would have downgraded its credit rating. Dofasco paid ThyssenKrupp a breakup fee of $215 million. Dofasco's board recommended the latest Arcelor offer of $71 per share in cash, worth an estimated $5.5 billion. While the breakup fee was criticized by some as excessive, most analysts otherwise praised President and CEO Donald A. Pether and the board of directors for their successful handling of the bidding situation.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Research on the {{relationship}} between social responsibility and the financial performance of companies has yielded ambivalent results. Since investments on different areas of social responsibility can promote distinct outcomes, in this study we focus on internal corporate social responsibility (I-CSR), that is, investments on employees. The objective of the study is to verify if outlays on I-CSR affect organizational performance. We analyzed financial information from companies listed in the São Paulo Stock Exchange, and their social balance sheets filled with the Brazilian Institute of Social and Economic Analysis between 2001 and 2007, applying Two-Stage Least Squares (2 SLS) equation model to minimize endogeneity and reverse causality problems. The results indicate that overall I-CSR was associated with revenue contemporarily, one and two years after the investments. Corporate outlays on healthcare, pension plans, <b>employee</b> education and <b>profit-sharing</b> all had positive effects on revenue {{in the years that followed}} such investments...|$|R

40|$|This chapter {{broadens}} {{our understanding}} of the added value of employee financial participation. Financial participation is a generic term for the participation of employees in profit and enterprise results including equity of their employing firm. In general, there are two forms of <b>employee</b> financial participation: <b>profit-sharing</b> and <b>employee</b> share ownership (including options). While profit sharing is considered as an incentive for employees with positive individual and organizational level outcomes, employee share ownership adds to that a share holding element where employees may consider themselves as co-owners of the firm, including the possibility of voice and control. In this chapter we review the current literature on the impact of financial participation and show that in most cases the literature shows positive effects on outcomes. However, the literature also shows that financial participation is not a HR instrument that produces the results mainly in a generic way, but that the best results can be achieved when embedded in a configuration of HR policies and practices, which we call ‘high performance ownership system’...|$|R

5000|$|In 1991, George Demoulas' family sued Mike Demoulas, Arthur T. Demoulas, and DeMoulas Super Markets, Inc. chief {{financial}} officer D. Harold Sullivan, alleging that the three violated the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of 1974 by using their positions as the trustees of the company's <b>employee</b> <b>profit-sharing</b> plan to make fiscally irresponsible real estate loans to friends and business associates. The United States Department of Labor filed a similar complaint six months later. On May 31, 1994 the Department of Labor announced that they had reached a settlement in which the trustees agreed to sell $22 million of the loans by July 11 or purchase them themselves as well as pay the plan $750,000 {{to make up for}} the dropped interest rates on the loans (unless the loan recipients paid the money instead). The trustees also agreed not to make any similar investments. The trustees admitted no wrongdoing in the case. Despite the heavy investment in risky real estate loans, the plan never posted a loss. In the civil case, Judge Rya W. Zobel ruled that the trustees' actions were [...] "wrong but not corrupt" [...] and that the settlement with the Department of Labor was [...] "an adequate remedy".

40|$|Since {{compensatory}} {{tools are}} strictly {{limited to the}} varied characteristics of labour market institutions, the economic literature has not yet developed a common terminology. When moving {{from one country to}} another, similar terms are used to refer to different tools (lump-sum bonuses, performance-related pay, incentive schemes, gain-sharing, <b>profit-sharing,</b> <b>employee</b> share ownership schemes, competence schemes). In order to qualify such a rich terminology, this work aims to analyse the numerous forms of variable wages, and to see how specific forms of performance-related pay (tools) respond to the specific needs (targets) of the firms. In fact, the relationship between employers and employees, especially in its most tangible form, the wage system, is the core of modern organisations today. Moreover, the global market has turned the systemic efficiency of the organization into a critical success factor for a company. Given similar environments, the practice of flexible wages has become, as of late, very popular in many countries, most of the time being deemed worthy of public subsidies. First seen as an instrument for facing the uncertainty tied to informational asymmetries, contained within the organization itself (vertical uncertainty), variable wages have been traditionally used also as a way for employers to share market uncertainty (horizontal uncertainty) with their employees.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} UK Data Service {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Workplace Employment Relations Survey (WERS) series is a periodic national survey of people at work. So far, the surveys have been conducted in 1980, 1984, 1990, 1998 and 2004. The purpose of each survey in the WERS series has been to provide large-scale, statistically reliable evidence about {{a broad range of}} industrial relations and employment practices across almost every sector of the economy in Great Britain. This evidence is collected with several objectives in mind. The survey aims to provide a mapping of employment relations practices in workplaces across Great Britain, monitor changes in those practices over time, inform policy development and permit an informed assessment of the effects of public policy, and bring about a greater understanding of employment relations as well as the labour market. The series was originally known as the Workplace Industrial Relations Survey, or WIRS - the name was changed in 1998 to better reflect the contemporary content of the series. The WIRS/WERS series from 1980 onwards is held at the UKDA under GN 33176. The Workplace Employee Relations Survey Private Sector Panel, 1998 - 2004 study analyses WERS workplace panel data to further understanding of the factors associated with the survival and growth of British private sector workplaces in the 1990 s. It identified the independent effects of workplace size, age, technology, research and development and human capital investment on survival and growth. It explored these relationships among different types of workplace, notably those in single-establishment and multi-establishment firms. It tested the sensitivity of results to alternative estimation techniques including selection-adjusted estimates of employment growth accounting for the probability of workplace survival. The results were sensitive to sample selection modelling. As such, the study {{was among the first to}} demonstrate the importance of tackling sample selection to properly understand the factors affecting workplace employment growth. Important differences are indicated in factors associated with growth and survival in single-site and multi-site firms. The study demonstrates that factors associated with employment growth per se can differ from those that influence internal growth, i. e. organic growth from within the workplace as opposed to growth associated with ownership change. The study extended the literature on workplace employment growth to consider human capital investments and demonstrates that, whereas some workforce composition variables do indeed affect workplace growth and survival, direct measures of human capital investment prolong the life of workplaces, but have no significant impact on workplace employment growth. Syntax code and logs used in the derivation of variables are included in the dataset, but otherwise documentation for this study is limited. Users are strongly encouraged to consult the documentation for the main WERS 2004 study (held under SN 5294) and the WERS 98 panel study (held under SN 4026). Further information about WERS is available from the WERS 2004 Information and Advice Service (WIAS) web site, and the Department for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (BERR) 2004 Workplace Employee Relations Survey and 1998 Workplace Employee Relations Survey web pages.

40|$|My {{research}} report addresses {{the question of}} how adopting Ubuntu values in order to promote meaning in the lives of employees working in a firm can be reconciled with the profit motive. How can a CEO add more meaning to the lives of employees by implementing Ubuntu values in the workplace? My aim is to explore how relationships within a firm can become more worthwhile or meaningful from an Ubuntu perspective. The central argument in my report is that a CEO should promote meaning in workers lives, should do so via Ubuntu and should adopt and implement policies and practices in the workplace such as worker consultation or participation in the decision-making process, <b>employee</b> <b>profit-sharing,</b> share ownership and voting. I recommend an innovative and practical method to increase employee participation, collaboration and involvement in running the firm using a visual mapping or storyboard process. My thesis is that the democratic idea of employees participating in meetings and being involved in the decision- making process as well as having shares in the firm is better from both an Ubuntu and a meaning perspective...|$|E
