5|$|The head {{is small}} and streamlined, adding to the agility of the cheetah. Saharan cheetah have narrow canine faces. Small, short, and rounded, the ears are marked by black patches on the back; the edges and base of the ears are tawny. The high-set eyes have round pupils. The whiskers, shorter and fewer in number than those of other felids, are fine and inconspicuous. The {{pronounced}} tear streaks are unique to the cheetah. These streaks originate {{from the corner of}} the eyes and run down the nose to the mouth. Their role is obscurethey may be serving as a shield for the <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sun's glare, a helpful feature as the cheetah hunts mainly during the day; another purpose could be to define facial expressions.|$|E
500|$|Whereas the {{majority}} opinion wholly ignored {{the proceedings of the}} General Assembly as irrelevant (the court lacking jurisdiction) and Brewer and Brown affirmed them, Harlan excoriated the legislature in his dissent. [...] "Looking into the record before us, I find such action taken by the body claiming to be organized as the lawful legislature of Kentucky as was discreditable in the last degree and unworthy of the free people whom it professed to represent. ... Those who composed that body seemed to have shut their <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> proof for fear that it would compel them to respect the popular will as expressed at the polls." [...] He also expressed disbelief at {{the majority}} opinion: [...] "he overturning of the public will, as expressed at the ballot box, without evidence or against evidence, in order to accomplish partisan ends, is a crime against free government, and deserves the execration of all lovers of liberty. ... I cannot believe that the judiciary is helpless in the presence of such a crime." ...|$|E

60|$|To {{him she was}} as full of life as {{the great}} world. He felt her live in every motion, in every roll, in every sway of her {{tapering}} masts, of those masts whose painted trucks move forever, to a seaman's <b>eye,</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> clouds or <b>against</b> <b>the</b> stars. To him she was always precious--like old love; always desirable--like a strange woman; always tender--like a mother; always faithful--like the favourite daughter of a man's heart.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hands}} upon his knees and pressed his <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> backs {{of his hands and}} so {{remained}} very still, a blankness beneath his own question.|$|E

60|$|She {{dropped back}} in the Morris chair, her <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> cushion, her hair disordered, both her hands {{gripping}} the left arm of the chair, her sobs throat-catching and long--throb-throb-throb in the death-still air.|$|E
30|$|Intraocular {{pressure}} {{is defined as}} the pressure of components of <b>the</b> <b>eye</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> fibrous tunica of the eye. IOP levels are determined by the ocular fluid volume which included intraocular fluid volume, choroidal blood volume and vitreous volume. Ocular compliance (extraocular compression including scleral hardness and extraocular muscle tone) at the same time {{plays an important role in}} the regulation of IOP (Qiu et al. 2014).|$|R
6000|$|... "Some strange commotion Is in his brain; he bites his lip and starts; Stops on a sudden, looks {{upon the}} ground, Then, lays {{his finger on}} his temple: straight, Springs out into fast gait; then, stops again, Strikes his breast hard; and anon, he casts His <b>eye</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> moon: in most strange postures We have seen him set himself."--Hen. VIII., act 3, sc. 2.|$|R

60|$|Part of {{the time}} it rained, and then she sat huddled up in the shawls and {{tarpaulins}} which the woman placed about her: then, when the sun came out, she still sat huddled up, closing her <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glare.|$|E
60|$|HOPE. No, I was {{not willing}} {{presently}} {{to know the}} evil of sin, nor the damnation that follows upon the commission of it; but endeavoured, when my mind at first began to be shaken with the Word, to shut mine <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> light thereof.|$|E

60|$|He clung miserably to the side, {{leaving the}} incensed skipper to demand {{explanations}} from the crew. The crew {{knew nothing about}} him, {{and said that he}} must have stowed himself away in an empty bunk; the skipper pointed out coarsely that there were no empty bunks, whereupon Bill said that he had not occupied his the previous evening, but had fallen asleep sitting on the locker, and had injured his <b>eye</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> corner of a bunk in consequence. In proof whereof he produced the eye.|$|R

60|$|And such indeed was the fact: {{rising out}} of a morass by which the archers were passing, a gallant heron, arching his neck, {{swelling}} his crest, placing his legs behind him, and his beak and red <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> wind, rose slowly, and offered the fairest mark in the world.|$|E

60|$|She was {{floating}} in smooth water now,--perhaps far on the overflooded fields.

40|$|In {{spite of}} {{treatment}} provided in anterior ischemic neuropathy, a prognosis for visual functions is poor and depends on severity of affection of vascular {{system of the}} body.

60|$|They had {{the fascination}} of a lonely vigil kept by some mysterious watcher up there, those two windows shining dimly upon the harbour {{in the whole}} vast extent of the {{abandoned}} building. The solitude could almost be felt. A strong smell of wood smoke hung about in a thin haze, which was faintly perceptible to his raised <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> glitter of the stars. As he advanced in the profound silence, the shrilling of innumerable cicalas in the dry grass seemed positively deafening to his strained ears. Slowly, step by step, {{he found himself in}} the great hall, sombre and full of acrid smoke.|$|E
6000|$|Old Pettance, {{waiting for}} Summerhay's return to stable-up for the night, heard that distant neigh {{and went to}} the garden gate, {{screwing}} up his little <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sunset. He could see a loose horse galloping down there in [...] "the wild," [...] where no horse should be, and thinking: [...] "There now; that artful devil's broke away from the guv'nor! Now I'll 'ave to ketch 'im!" [...] he went back, got some oats, and set forth at the best gait of his stiff-jointed feet. The old horseman characteristically did not think of accidents. The guv'nor had got off, no doubt, to unhitch that heavy gate--the one you had to lift. That 'orse--he was a masterpiece of mischief! His difference with the animal still rankled in a mind that did not easily forgive.|$|E
60|$|At {{first the}} men {{stared at each}} other, but an instant later a dozen hands were helping him, nervously digging and {{clearing}} away the rubbish.

6000|$|But when Nod {{lifted his}} eyes to Mulgarmeerez, {{it seemed as if}} many phantom faces were looking down on them as they hastened, like some small company of hares or coneys, straggling across the whiteness. Being {{refreshed}} with sleep and Tishnar's phantom supper, the Mountain-mulgars did not stay to take their [...] "glare," [...] but just screened their feeble <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> sunbeams with eagle feathers, and, with Thimble swinging in his litter, scurried on across these smoother slopes. By night Mulgarmeerez, last of the seven peaks of Arakkaboa, was left behind them, and it seemed the wind blew not so sharply out of the haze {{on this side of the}} haunted woods. The travellers towards evening slept in a dry cavern. But it was a fidgety sleep, for this cave was the haunt of an odd and wily sand-flea that made the most of a Mulgar-supper, more toothsome than anything it had feasted on for many a day.|$|E
60|$|As the {{carriage}} rolled away, four men lounged {{out of a}} window on the veranda, shading their <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> level beams. One was still in evening dress, and one in the uniform of a captain of artillery; the others had already changed their gala attire, the elder of the party having assumed those extravagant tweeds which the tourist from Great Britain usually offers as a gentle concession to inferior yet more florid civilization. Nevertheless, he beamed back heartily on the sun, and remarked, in a pleasant Scotch accent, that: Did they know it was very extraordinary how clear the morning was, so free from clouds and mist and fog? The young man in evening dress fluently agreed to the facts, and suggested, in idiomatic French-English, that one comprehended that the bed was an insult to one's higher nature and an ingratitude to their gracious hostess, who had spread out this lovely garden and walks for their pleasure; that nothing was more beautiful than the dew sparkling on the rose, or the matin song of the little birds.|$|E
60|$|It was all gay and bizarre, {{and it gave}} Northwick {{a thrill}} of boyish delight. He {{wondered}} for a moment why he had never come to Quebec in winter before, and brought his children. He beckoned to the walnut-faced driver {{of one of the}} carrioles which waited outside the station to take the passengers across the river, and tossed his bag {{into the bottom of the}} little sledge. He gave the name of a hotel in the Upper Town, and the driver whipped his tough, long-fetlocked pony over the space of ice which was kept clear of snow by diligent sweeping with fir-tree tops, and then up the steep incline of Mountain Hill. The streets were roadways from house-front to house-front, smooth, elastic levels of thickly-bedded, triply-frozen snow; and the foot passengers, muffled to the <b>eyes</b> <b>against</b> <b>the</b> morning cold, came and went among the vehicles in the middle of the street, or crept along close to the house-walls, to keep out of the light avalanches of an overnight snow that slipped here and there from the steep tin roofs.|$|E

60|$|A {{dull and}} startling thud resounded through the room; their <b>eyes</b> blinked <b>against</b> <b>the</b> coming horror; and still {{clinging}} together like drowning people, they {{fell to the}} floor. Then followed a prolonged and strident hissing as from the indignant pit; an offensive stench seized them by the throat; the room was filled with dense and choking fumes.|$|R
