40|$|Prostate cancer {{recurrence}} that is detectable {{only by a}} rise in PSA level after successful local {{treatment for}} prostate cancer is a very common problem facing patients and their clinicians. Recent studies suggest that early hormonal therapy provides a survival benefit in patients with M 0 disease and after RP in patients with pelvic lymph node metastases; however, the survival benefit for PSA-only recurrence {{has yet to be}} confirmed. As shown by the case histories presented here, unconventional hormonal therapy, e. g. antiandrogen monotherapy, appears to be a reasonable option. The potency-sparing potential of this approach is appealing, as is the reduced degree of other side-effects associated with traditional <b>hormonal</b> (<b>castration)</b> therapies, but the long-term efficacy in patients with early PSA-only progression is unknown. The possibility of breast symptoms during antiandrogen monotherapy may be reduced with the use of prophylactic low-dose breast irradiation. More clinical trials are needed to determine the best treatments, alone and in combination, for these patients. SCOPUS: sh. jFLWINinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|E
40|$|Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) is a {{pleiotropic}} cytokine {{involved in}} prostate regulation and in prostate cancer (PC) development/progression. IL- 6 {{acts as a}} paracrine and autocrine growth stimulator in benign and tumor prostate cells. The levels of IL- 6 and respective receptors are increased during prostate carcinogenesis and tumor progression. Several studies reported that increased serum and plasma IL- 6 and soluble interleukin- 6 receptor levels are associated with aggressiveness {{of the disease and}} are associated with a poor prognosis in PC patients. In PC treatment, patients diagnosed with advanced stages are frequently submitted to <b>hormonal</b> <b>castration,</b> although most patients will eventually fail this therapy and die from recurrent castration-resistant prostate cancer (CRPC). Therefore, {{it is important to understand}} the mechanisms involved in CRPC. Several pathways have been proposed to be involved in CRPC development, and their understanding will improve the way to more effective therapies. In fact, the prostate is known to be dependent, not exclusively, on androgens, but also on growth factors and cytokines. The signaling pathway mediated by IL- 6 may be an alternative pathway in the CRPC phenotype acquisition and cancer progression, under androgen deprivation conditions. The principal goal of this review is to evaluate the role of IL- 6 pathway signaling in human PC development and progression and discuss the interaction of this pathway with the androgen recepto pathway. Furthermore, we intend to evaluate the inclusion of IL- 6 and its receptor levels as a putative new class of tumor biomarkers. The IL- 6 /IL- 6 R signaling pathway may be included as a putative molecular marker for aggressiveness in PC and it may be able to maintain tumor growth through the AR pathway under androgen-deprivation conditions. The importance of the IL- 6 /IL- 6 R pathway in regulation of PC cells makes it a good candidate for targeted therapy...|$|E
40|$|Following {{the birth}} of modern opera in Italy in 1600, the demand for soprano voices grew up and the prepuberal {{castration}} was carried out to preserve the young male voice into adult life. Among the castrati, Gaspare Pacchierotti {{was probably one of}} the most famous. The remains of Pacchierotti were exhumed for the first time in 2013, for a research in the reconstruction of his biological profile, to understand the secrets behind his sublime voice and how the castration influenced the body. All the findings discovered, through anthropological and Computed Tomography analyses, are consistent both with the occupational markers of a singer and with the <b>hormonal</b> effects of <b>castration.</b> The erosion of cervical vertebrae, the insertion of respiratory muscles and muscles of the arms can be an effect of the bodily position and exercise during singing. The <b>hormonal</b> effect of <b>castration</b> were related to osteoporosis and to the disorders of spine...|$|R

50|$|If treated, {{patients}} with low risk disease are usually treated with active surveillance, prostatectomy, or radiotherapy alone. Patients with intermediate risk disease are candidates for prostatectomy or radiotherapy {{and a short}} duration (less than 6 months) of <b>hormonal</b> ablation (medical <b>castration</b> using a gonadotropin-releasing hormone analog). Although the role of surgery in these patients remains uncertain, those with high risk disease are usually treated with radiotherapy and a long duration of hormonal ablation. Many high risk patients are not cured by this treatment, {{and the search for}} better treatments in this group is a particularly pressing concern in prostate cancer research.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Maniaci (born in 1976) is an American opera singer. Possessing a male soprano voice, Maniaci {{is noted}} for {{his claim to}} be able to sing into the upper soprano {{register}} without using falsetto, an otherwise common phonation for men who sing in high registers, such as countertenors. Although this was possible for castrati, because of the <b>hormonal</b> imbalance following <b>castration,</b> Maniaci claims that, for some unknown reason, his larynx did not develop and lengthen completely, causing his voice not to [...] "break" [...] in the usual manner. Maniaci claims that this physical particularity has given him the ability to sing in the soprano register without sounding like a typical countertenor or a female singer. There are, however, critics who claim that Maniaci actually sings in falsetto.|$|R
40|$|Background: Androgen is {{the most}} {{important}} growth factor for the development andgrowth of prostatic adenocarcinomas. For patients with advanced prostatecancer, <b>hormonal</b> manipulation including <b>castration</b> and antiandrogen therapyis a well-established mode of treatment. The choice of hormonal therapyfor prostate cancer depends not only on the desired progression-free andoverall survival, but also on the patient’s quality of life, treatment costs, andtreatment toxicities. Methods: This was an open, non-comparative trial to determine the tolerability of 50 mg bicalutamide (Casodex®) in combination with castration; we also investigatedwhether the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) rates of change at weeks 4 and 12 were indicative of an increased risk of progression. Results: Thirty-seven patients were enrolled in the study from December 1996 toJune 1999 in Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Taoyuan. The overall incidencerate of adverse events was 27 %. The most frequent adverse event washot flushes (5. 4 %). The rate of overall disease response was 85. 3 %. No evidencewas found for any predictive relationship between serum PSA concentrationand risk of progression. Conclusion: The overall results indicate that bicalutamide administered as a 50 -mg dailydosage in combination with castration is a well-tolerated therapy for thetreatment of patients with advanced prostate cancer...|$|R
40|$|Objective(s) : To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} bisphosphonates in the long-term supportive care of patients with prostate cancer, an emerging medical challenge. Although the success of current therapeutic options has extended the survival of patients with prostate cancer, they often develop skeletal morbidity from disease and treatment-related effects that undermine skeletal integrity. Methods: Studies were identified through MEDLINE searches, review of bibliographies of relevant articles, and review of abstracts from scientific meetings. Results: Low bone mass is prevalent in patients in early stages of prostate cancer, although {{the reasons for this}} correlation are unknown. Furthermore, androgen deprivation therapy (ADT) by either pharmaceutical (including <b>hormonal)</b> or surgical <b>castration</b> causes significant decreases in bone mineral density. Pamidronate has been shown to prevent bone loss, whereas zoledronic acid has been shown to increase bone mass in men undergoing ADT. Finally, zoledronic acid is the only bisphosphonate that has demonstrated efficacy in reducing objectively measurable skeletal complications in patients with bone metastases secondary to prostate cancer. Conclusion: Bisphosphonates, zoledronic acid in particular, have potent activities against osteoclasts, which affect bone integrity. Zoledronic acid has now become an additional option that can provide benefits to patients with prostate cancer throughout the course of their disease. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved.

40|$|The authors {{quantified}} {{the type}} IV collagen fibers volumetric density {{in the basement}} membrane of bladder wall of ovariectomized rats with and without estradiol replacement. This study was conducted on 40 Wistar rats (3 months old) randomly divided in 4 groups: group 1, remained intact (control); group 2, submitted to bilateral oophorectomy and daily replacement 4 weeks later of beta-estradiol for 12 weeks; group 3, sham operated and daily replacement 4 weeks later of sesame oil for 12 weeks; and group 4, submitted to bilateral oophorectomy and killed after 12 weeks. It was used in immunohistochemistry evaluation using type IV collagen polyclonal antibody to stain the fibers on paraffin rat bladder sections. the M- 42 stereological grid system was {{used to analyze the}} fibers. Ovariectomy had an increase effect on the volumetric density of the type IV collagen fibers in the basement membrane of rat bladder wall Estradiol replacement in castrated animals demonstrated a significative difference in the stereological parameters when compared to the castrated group without <b>hormonal</b> replacement. Surgical <b>castration</b> performed on rats induced an increasing volumetric density of type IV collagen fibers in the basement membrane of rats bladder wall and the estradiol treatment had a significant effect in keeping a low volumetric density of type IV collagen fibers in the basement-membrane of rats bladder wall.

40|$|Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that, in male rats, the magnitude of contact hypersensitivity (CHS) can be enhanced by morphine treatment. The present experiments test {{the hypothesis that the}} μ-opioids morphine, etorphine, and buprenorphine would produce significant sex differences in the magnitude of 2, 4 -dinitrofluorobenzene-induced CHS. During tests conducted over a 192 -h period, morphine, etorphine, and buprenorphine administered before elicitation of CHS on the external surface of the ear (pinna) potentiated the CHS response, and the magnitude of this enhancement was significantly greater in females than males. By contrast, morphine had no effect on croton oil-induced irritant contact dermatitis, indicating that morphine's effects on CHS do not generalize to immunologically nonspecific forms of contact dermatitis. Activation of brain μ-opioid receptors is responsible for the effects of morphine on CHS, because intracere-broventricular treatment with the μ-opioid receptor antagonist β-funaltrexamine blocked morphine potentiation of CHS in females and males. The sex differences in morphine potentiation of CHS appear to be a result of the gonadal <b>hormonal</b> milieu, because <b>castration</b> enhanced the CHS response following vehicle and morphine treatment, whereas ovariectomy significantly attenuated the enhancement of CHS by morphine. Because ovariectomy had no effect on the CHS response following vehicle treatment, the presence of female gonadal hormones may underlie the sex differences in morphine potentiation of CHS in gonadally intact animals. Overall, these results support an increased sensitivity to the modulatory effects of opioids on the CHS response in females that depends on the interaction between gonadal hormones and the central μ-opioid system...|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} sex steroids in the sex-related difference in the hepatic uptake of organic anions, sulphobromophthalein (bromsulphalein, BSP) transport was measured in hepatocytes isolated from rats either deprived of <b>hormonal</b> influence by <b>castration</b> at prepubertal age or after hormonal substitution. In control animals, the kinetics of BSP uptake showed the presence of two components: one saturable (0 - 3 microM), with high affinity and low capacity, and the other linear (9 - 30 microM), probably related to the non-specific component of BSP uptake. Sex difference was detected only in the saturable portion of the uptake process as the apparent Km was significantly lower in females than in males (3. 8 +/- 0. 7 vs. 6. 1 +/- 1. 8 microM, mean +/- S. D. of six animals, P less than 0. 01). In contrast, no difference was observed in Vmax (2. 3 +/- 0. 3 vs. 2. 2 +/- 0. 7 nmol BSP. (mg protein) - 1. min- 1). Castration {{was associated with the}} disappearance of the saturable uptake site and abolished the sex difference. Progesterone treatment of castrated males failed to restore the saturable kinetics of BSP uptake. In contrast, administration of oestradiol to castrated males or testosterone to castrated females did restore the saturable kinetics of the high-affinity BSP uptake. Km and Vmax were comparable to those of adult females and males, respectively, with the exception of testosterone which induced a Vmax value higher than that observed in the other groups of animals. These data suggest that the influence of oestrogen and testosterone is necessary for the expression of the high-affinity, low-capacity carrier-mediated process of hepatic BSP uptake.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a now very topical and much debated issue of sexual deviants, who have {{committed}} particularly serious sexual crimes and who {{have the opportunity to}} undergo treatment for their disorder using pharmacological <b>castration</b> (<b>hormonal</b> inhibition) from an ethical perspective, rid of media tint sensationalism. It also deals with people who demonstrably do not suffer from any form of sexual preference disorders (paraphilia), and yet they have committed a serious act, as those who are affected by this disorder. The objective {{of this paper is to}} highlight the issue of sexual deviants who need treatment, without being denied any human rights and, in particular, to distinguish, but not justify, the behaviour of people suffering from such disorders, which, although hardly excusable, can be understood from a certain perspective and the behaviour of healthy individuals whose actions cannot be understood even with the broadest and most benevolent view on the issue. The research was, in relation to the objectives set, carried out in the form of an anonymous quantitative questionnaire that was directed to verify defined hypotheses, in particular, whether the use of pharmacological castration is consistent with human rights, whether pharmacological castration is acceptable only with the reception of an informed consent from the patient { [...] } a convicted person - and the view of experts on the use of this form of treatment for sexual deviants. In order to achieve the most relevant results, the research sample consisted of physicians { [...] } psychiatrists and psychologists from various facilities, both outpatient and inpatient, where these deviants are treated. Only to supplement the paper and add authenticity, a qualitative research was carried out in the form of an unguided telephone interview with people { [...] } prisoners { [...] } who have committed particularly serious premeditated criminal acts and who have been treated with pharmaceuticals. The views of both the groups were then, where possible, jointly compared. The knowledge gained can be used to inform the general public better about these issues, which could prevent generalizations of individual cases and one-sided view of the nature of the issue. Also the convicted sexual deviants could benefit, knowing that they are not alone with their problem in the society...|$|R
