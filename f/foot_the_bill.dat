5|$|By late 1915, British {{forces in}} the border areas of Northern Rhodesia and Nyasaland, on German East Africa's {{south-western}} flank, were severely stretched. Disease was a constant curse, decimating the ranks. Francis Drummond Chaplin, the British South Africa Company administrator in Southern Rhodesia, offered to provide the British with a column of between 500 and 1,000 askaris, and Whitehall accepted this in March 1916; however, there was then disagreement regarding who would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the organisation of this enterprise. After this was resolved in April 1916—the Company agreed to pay, conditional on reimbursement by the British Colonial Office—recruitment began in May.|$|E

WSC also gained access to Brisbane's Test ground, The Gabba, and were offered use of the Adelaide Oval, which was rejected. Perth and Adelaide were dropped from the itinerary. A strategy of focusing on audiences in Melbourne and Sydney was now in place.|$|E

However, the Detroit Free Press of October 9, 2008, stated that maintaining the terminal in its present condition would cost upwards of $4 million annually in utilities, a sore spot for airlines at DTW who <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> in part, through airport landing fees; the airlines were hoping for a greater cost savings once the Smith and Berry terminals were decommissioned.

The voters of Columbus were considering a referendum {{to build a}} publicly financed arena, a major step toward approval of their NHL bid. When League Commissioner Gary Bettman visited Columbus {{to meet with the}} community's leaders about the franchise proposal, there was concern that the voters might not pass the needed referendum. The civic leaders told Bettman {{that they would not be}} willing to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the team if the referendum failed. However, just after the meeting adjourned, John H. McConnell (one of those who entered the bid) privately guaranteed Bettman that an arena would be built, referendum or not.|$|E
500|$|In {{the words}} of the {{historian}} Peter McLaughlin, the Southern Rhodesian settlers [...] "seemed to out-British the British" [...] in their patriotic zeal, so it was to the frustration of many of them that the Company did not immediately commit to any martial action. While it sent supportive messages to Whitehall, the Company felt it could not raise any kind of expeditionary force without first considering the implications for its administrative operations; as a commercial concern, it was possible for the Company to go bankrupt. Who would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for war expenditure, its hierarchy pondered: the Company itself, the Rhodesian taxpayers or the British government? ...|$|E

500|$|The {{bodies were}} transported to Trieste by the {{battleship}} [...] {{and then to}} Vienna by special train. [...] Even though most foreign royalty had planned to attend, they were pointedly disinvited and the funeral was just the immediate imperial family, with the dead couple's three children excluded from the few public ceremonies. The officer corps was forbidden to salute the funeral train, and {{this led to a}} minor revolt led by Archduke Karl, the new heir to the throne. The public viewing of the coffins was curtailed severely and even more scandalously, Montenuovo tried unsuccessfully to make the children <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> The Archduke and Duchess were interred at Artstetten Castle because his wife could not be buried at the Imperial Crypt.|$|E
500|$|On 2 December 2005, {{tensions}} between King's and the London School of Economics (LSE) were ignited when at least 200 students from LSE (located in Aldwych near the Strand Campus) diverted {{off from the}} annual [...] "barrel run" [...] and caused an estimated £32,000 of damage to the English department at King's. The Times reported that LSE director Howard Davies attended the fun run event, while LSE claimed that Davies only attended for a short time. King's principal, Sir Rick Trainor, deplored the behaviour, appealed to King's students to remain calm and called for no retaliation. The LSE Students' Union later on 6 December issued a formal apology, condemned the actions, as well as promising to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the damage repair.|$|E

During this period he passed the time by mining his collection of classical Latin texts by writers such as Cicero, Seneca, and Tacitus to write treatises on subjects such as the elephant and the Nile Delta, exercises which were designed to display rhetorical flair and high style. He also further annoyed Dutch authorities by spending lavish sums on clothing and food, things for which the VOC had to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b>|$|E

500|$|The {{committees}} in the United States faced great difficulties in obtaining {{funds for the}} construction of the pedestal. The Panic of 1873 had led to an economic depression that persisted through much of the decade. The Liberty statue project was not the only such undertaking that had difficulty raising money: construction of the obelisk later known as the Washington Monument sometimes stalled for years; it would ultimately take over three-and-a-half decades to complete. There was criticism both of Bartholdi's statue and {{of the fact that the}} gift required Americans to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for the pedestal. In the years following the Civil War, most Americans preferred realistic artworks depicting heroes and events from the nation's history, rather than allegorical works like the Liberty statue. There was also a feeling that Americans should design American public works—the selection of Italian-born Constantino Brumidi to decorate the Capitol had provoked intense criticism, even though he was a naturalized U.S. citizen. Harper's Weekly declared its wish that [...] "M. Bartholdi and our French cousins had 'gone the whole figure' while they were about it, and given us statue and pedestal at once." [...] The New York Times stated that [...] "no true patriot can countenance any such expenditures for bronze females in the present state of our finances." [...] Faced with these criticisms, the American committees took little action for several years.|$|E
500|$|The Age of Adz {{received}} positive reviews {{upon its}} release. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalised rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 80, based on 33 reviews, indicating [...] "generally favorable reviews". Keith Meatto of the Frontier Psychiatrist described the album as [...] "a musical masterpiece that blends analog and digital sounds as it reflects on love and loss, life and death, humanity and divinity". Entertainment.ie's Jenny Mulligan described Stevens as [...] "a strange one, that's for sure, {{but he may}} just be a genius". Uncut commented that the album provides plenty of evidence to argue that he is either [...] "one {{of the most important}} songwriters of his generation" [...] or [...] "just an infuriating, neurotic show-off". Alexis Petridis of The Guardian said that although the album [...] "goes a bit barmy and over-the-top" [...] there are some [...] "incredible tune" [...] that are [...] "not only genuinely remarkable, but genuinely enjoyable". Alex Denney of NME similarly commented that the album [...] "conjures just enough moments of heart-stopping gorgeousness to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> for its dizzying excesses". Sam Lewis of the BBC remarked on the same point: that the album is [...] "suffused with individual moments of brilliance", but overall it is [...] "let down by its self-conscious incoherence".|$|E
500|$|Scott {{had hoped}} {{on his return}} to find Discovery free from the ice, but she {{remained}} held fast. Work had begun with ice saws, but after 12days' labour only two short parallel cuts of [...] had been carved, with the ship still [...] from open water. On 5 January 1904 the relief ship Morning returned, {{this time with a}} second ship, the Terra Nova. Colbeck was carrying firm instructions from the Admiralty that, if Discovery could not be freed by a certain date she was to be abandoned and her complement brought home on the two relief ships. This ultimatum resulted from Markham's dependence on the Treasury for meeting the costs of this second relief expedition, since the expedition's coffers were empty. The Admiralty would <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> only on their own terms. The deadline agreed between the three captains was 25 February, and it became a race against time for the relief vessels to reach Discovery, still held fast at Hut Point. As a precaution Scott began the transfer of his scientific specimens to the other ships. Explosives were used to break up the ice, and the sawing parties resumed work, but although the relief ships were able to edge closer, by the end of January Discovery remained icebound, two miles (approx. 3km) from the rescuers. On 10 February Scott accepted {{that he would have to}} abandon her, but on 14 February most of the ice suddenly broke up, and Morning and Terra Nova were at last able to sail alongside Discovery. A final explosive charge removed the remaining ice on 16 February, and the following day, after a last scare when she became temporarily grounded on a shoal, Discovery began the return journey to New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|Eleven {{days before}} the {{scheduled}} walk date, Wallenda faced a new challenge. [...] Official permits {{had not yet been}} granted in New York and park officials were threatening to cancel the event over payment issues. [...] Wallenda's managers claimed to be on schedule with the US$225,000 the state was charging him. [...] The park commission claimed that Wallenda's failure to sign the necessary paperwork was holding things up. [...] To avoid negative publicity, Wallenda's manager, David Simone, withdrew $75,000 from his personal account to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill.</b> [...] Permits were issued the next day. [...] However, two {{days before the}} event, New York parks threatened to pull the permits as Wallenda's team still owed over $10,000. According to Wallenda, [...] "the U.S. side was just nasty to deal with toward the end. They were accusing us of lying and saying we weren't fulfilling the contract." [...] However, he said the local officials were great to work with, blaming higher-ups in Albany for the problems. Maziarz acknowledged there were [...] "some tense moments", but said there was never any chance of the event not happening. [...] Ultimately, a wire transfer by ABC resolved the issue. No similar issues arose on the Canadian side.|$|E
2500|$|The cost of {{producing}} the official history {{was raised in the}} House of Commons on 13 June 1922, during a proposal to farm out the work to private enterprise. Some MPs claimed to have heard nothing of the History.... despite five volumes having been published to a very good press. Daniel was called before H. A. L. Fisher, the President of the Board of Education and pointed out that working on the History.... would never pay a living wage and that for educational reasons the government must <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill,</b> because of the exceptional value of the work. He calculated that the cost of the History.... from 1916 to 1922 was about £42,000, the military histories costing £16,800 and the naval works £11,800, while the annual cost {{of producing}} Hansard was £44,000. Daniel also showed that the cost of the war from 3 August 1914 to 31 March 1920 was £11,196,927,000 or £3,500 per minute, a vast cost against which, the price of making the experience available for education was about four minutes of war expenditure per year for the Historical Section. The next meeting of the Historical Section subcommittee on 31 July 1922 endorsed the continuation of the project.|$|E
2500|$|That {{dispersion}} of power, though seen by many, then and later, {{as a major}} weakness of the Republic, was actually the foundation stone of De Witt's political system, that he called de Ware Vrijheid (the [...] "True Freedom"). We have already seen that De Witt primarily defended Oldenbarnevelt's and Grotius' claim to supremacy of (Holland's) provincial sovereignty over {{the sovereignty of the}} Generality under this moniker. But the doctrine went further. [...] "True Freedom" [...] implied the rejection of an [...] "eminent head", not only of the federal state (where it would have conflicted with provincial sovereignty), but also of the provincial political system. De Witt considered Princes and Potentates as such, as detrimental to the public good, because of their inherent tendency to waste tax payer's money on military adventures in search of glory and useless territorial aggrandizement. As the province of Holland only abutted friendly territory, the Holland regents had no territorial designs themselves, and they looked askance at such designs by the other provinces, because they knew they were likely to have to <b>foot</b> <b>the</b> <b>bill</b> anyway. The Republic therefore from time to time threw its weight around in the German principalities to the East, but always to protect strategic interests, not for territorial gain. Likewise, after the dispute over the Overmaas territory (which still had been left over from the Munster treaty) was settled with the partition treaty of 1661 with Spain, there were no further territorial claims in the Southern Netherlands, till after the War of Spanish Succession fundamentally changed the strategic situation.|$|E
