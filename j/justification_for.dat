5|$|According to {{historian}} Thomas Paul, Tipu {{shifted his}} hatred for the British to the Mangalorean Catholics and other South Indian Christian communities.

5|$|Early in his term, Breathitt won favor {{from both}} Whigs and Democrats by {{opposing}} South Carolina's actions during the Nullification Crisis. Following Breathitt's lead, {{the state legislature}} passed resolutions condemning the doctrine of nullification on February 2, 1833. This action was particularly significant because John C. Calhoun's <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> nullification was largely based on the 1799 Kentucky Resolutions.|$|E
5|$|Even though Thiệu {{used the}} defeat of the South Vietnamese forces as a <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the arrest of those generals, his real {{intention}} behind the arrests was to avert an imaginary military coup against him. For that reason, he chose to pull the Airborne Division back to III Corps, which was commanded by loyalist officers, instead of the Marine Corps Division.|$|E

40|$|Mothers 2 ̆ 7 (N = 106) {{ratings of}} rules and child {{compliance}} for their young children, {{and the effects of}} child temperament and mothers 2 ̆ 7 <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> rules on ratings {{of rules and}} compliance, were examined longitudinally at 14 and 24 months. Rules for young toddlers pertained primarily to safety, safeguarding property, interpersonal issues, and, as children got older, conventions. As expected, mothers endorsed moral <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> interpersonal rules, prudential <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> safety and property rules, and conventional and psychological <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> conventions. Compliance increased significantly with age and was greater for property, safety, and interpersonal behaviors than for other issues. Parent-rated child temperament and harm justifications predicted mothers 2 ̆ 7 ratings of rules and child compliance, and ratings of rules, compliance, and justifications demonstrated continuity over time...|$|R
5|$|In 1941, {{he wrote}} and {{published}} Germany Must Perish! which called for the sterilization of the German people {{and the distribution of}} the German lands.

5|$|In the United States, Coke's {{decision}} {{met with}} a better reaction.

5|$|Modern weapons technologies, {{including}} the required research and development, are particularly capital-intensive and costly. The time between initial {{research and the}} deployment of weapon systems can be {{as long as a}} decade, during which the government must provide financial security and political <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the project.

40|$|The {{original}} <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> {{the oppression}} of both African–Americans in the United States and Dalits in India were drawn from the religious systems of thought of both societies. However, over the centuries, the basic <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> {{the oppression of}} African–Americans changed, while the primary rationale for the oppression of Dalits still remains rooted in religion. This essay sketches out the dominant forms that made and continue to make the oppression of African–Americans appear {{to be part of}} the natural order of things. It shows how the primary <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> the oppression of Blacks changed over time. In so doing, this essay demonstrates the dynamic nature of oppression and that success against one form of oppression may not lead an oppressed group to liberation, but may simply generate a new set of <b>justifications</b> <b>for</b> their continued oppression in a different form...|$|R

5|$|Vermigli {{developed}} a strong doctrine of double predestination independently of John Calvin. His interpretation was that God's will determines both damnation {{as well as}} salvation. Vermigli's belief is similar but not identical to Calvin's. Vermigli's political theology was important in the Elizabethan religious settlement; he provided theological <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> Royal Supremacy, the doctrine that the king of a territory, rather than any ecclesiastical authority, rules the church.|$|E
5|$|A common <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> {{the need}} for {{astronomy}} {{is the need to}} develop an accurate calendar for agricultural reasons. Ancient texts like Hesiod's Works and Days, an ancient farming manual, would appear to contradict this. Instead astronomical observations are used in combination with ecological signs, such as bird migrations to determine the seasons. Ethnoastronomical work with the Mursi of Ethiopia shows that haphazard astronomy continued until recent times {{in some parts of the}} world. All the same, calendars appear to be an almost universal phenomenon in societies as they provide tools for the regulation of communal activities.|$|E
5|$|A key {{distinction}} between the bills of rights of the Commonwealth jurisdictions referred to above and the Singapore Constitution {{is that in the}} latter document, the grounds set out in Article 15(4) for restricting freedom of religion are not expressly subject to any requirement of reasonableness or necessity in a democratic society. One may query whether this is sufficient <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> a Singapore court to decline to apply a proportionality analysis to Article 15(4).|$|E

5|$|After Nader got {{help for}} his drug {{addiction}} at Hazelton Clinic in Minnesota, All My Children {{opted not to}} bring him back. Nader filed a $31.7 million lawsuit against ABC for breach of contract under the Americans with Disabilities Act. ABC's lawyers cited Nader's violation of the morals clause in his contract as <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> not rehiring him. The firing and lawsuit {{caught the attention of}} non-soap opera medias such as TV Guide, Inside Edition, People, Celebrity Justice, Extra, Entertainment Tonight, and Larry King Live. Manhattan Federal Judge Jed S. Rakoff threw out the suit in 2004.|$|E
5|$|As of 2016, the {{black-necked grebe}} is {{classified}} as least concern by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The trend {{of the population is}} uncertain, as some populations are decreasing, whereas others are stable, have an uncertain trend, or are increasing. The <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> the current classification of this species is its very large population (estimated around 3.9–4.2 million individuals) combined with a large estimated extent of occurrence (about 155 million km2 (60 million sq mi)). This grebe is probably the most numerous grebe in the world.|$|E
5|$|Crocodilia and Crocodylia {{have been}} used interchangeably for decades {{starting}} with Schmidt's redescription of the group from the formerly defunct term Loricata. Schmidt used the older term Crocodilia, based on Owen's original name for the group. Shortly after, Wermuth opted for Crocodylia as the proper name for this redescribed group, basing it on the type genus Crocodylus (Laurenti, 1768). Dundee—in a revision of many reptilian and amphibian names—argued strongly for Crocodylia to be the spelling for the group. However, {{it was not until}} the advent of cladistics and phylogenetic nomenclature that a more solid <b>justification</b> <b>for</b> assuming one spelling over the other was proposed.|$|E
