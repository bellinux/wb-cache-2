40|$|A {{new concept}} of H∞ {{formation}} is proposed {{to handle a}} group of agents navigating in a free and an obstacle-laden environment while maintaining a desired formation and changing formations when required. With respect {{to the requirements of}} changing formation subject to internal or external events, a hybrid multiagent system (HMAS) is formulated in this paper. Based on the fact that obstacles impose the negative effect on the formation of HMAS, the H∞ formation is introduced to reflect the above disturbed situation and quantify the attenuation level of obstacle avoidance via the H∞-norm of formation stability. An improved Newtonian potential function and a set of repulsive functions are employed to guarantee the HMAS formation-keeping and collision-avoiding from obstacles in a path planning problem, respectively. Simulation results in this paper show that the proposed formation algorithms can effectively allow the multiagent system to avoid penetration into obstacles while accomplishing prespecified global objective successfully. © 2013 <b>Dong</b> <b>Xue</b> et al...|$|E

We first explain in brief their portfolio choice model for the complete markets and the solution to the Goal Reaching problem and Yaari’s model. We study the effect of Sharpe ratio on the two and are able to analytically prove that for the Goal Reaching Model an increase in Sharpe ratio increases the probability of achieving the target. We study in depth a concrete example of a particular distortion function- the power function in the Yaari’s model.

Most commercially available FPs have been optimized for their oligomerization state to prevent potential structural constraints that may interfere with the native function of fused proteins. Other approach to reducing structural constraints may include minimizing the structure of GFPs. Previous studies in an enhanced GFP variant (EGFP) identified a series of deletions that can retain GFP fluorescence. In this study, we interrogated the structural plasticity of a UV-optimized GFP variant (GFPUV) to amino acid deletions, characterized the effects of deletions and explored the feasibility of rescuing the fluorescence of deletion mutants using folding-enhancing mutations. Methods: Transposon mutagenesis was used to screen amino acid deletions in GFP that led to fluorescent and nonfluorescent phenotypes. The fluorescent GFP mutants were characterized for their whole-cell fluorescence and fractio...|$|R

Gao Qiu bribes the guards, <b>Dong</b> Chao and <b>Xue</b> Ba, who are escorting Lin Chong there to kill him along the way. To make Lin Chong defenceless, the guards trick him into washing his feet in boiling water and cause his feet to become sore and blistered. Lu Zhishen secretly follows Lin Chong and saves him from death in Wild Boar Forest when the guards try to kill him. Lin Chong manages to persuade Lu Zhishen not to kill the guards, saying {{that they had no}} choice but to follow orders. After giving the guards a display of his strength by knocking down a tree, Lu Zhishen bids farewell to Lin Chong and returns to Dongjing. Fearful for their lives, the guards escort Lin Chong to Cangzhou without causing further problems. While in Cangzhou, Lin Chong meets and befriends Chai Jin, who provides him with silver to bribe the jailers in the Cangzhou prison to make Lin's stay there more comfortable. However, Gao Qiu is dissatisfied with Lin Chong's fate and sends Lu Qian to Cangzhou to kill Lin.|$|R
40|$|High flux solar simulators, {{comprising}} {{an array}} of high-intensity-discharge lamps coupled with elliptical reflectors, have been widely employed to study concentrated solar thermal energy in a controlled manner. However, the procedures for the optical designs of such systems are rarely reported. This paper presents designs, and a design methodology, of an optical configuration consisting of {{an array of}} lamps, using a commercial Monte Carlo ray-tracing code, Tracepro®. The design employs an array of 23 × 6 kW metal halide lamps introduced through two sizes of elliptical reflectors, 17 have a diameter of 950 mm and are in the inner section, while the other 6 reflectors have a diameter of 715 mm and are in an outer ring. An average heat flux of 1. 447 MW/m 2 through a target aperture of 50 mm was calculated to be achieved with this array. These reflectors were configured with a maximum cone angle of 42 °, relative to the axis of the aperture. Using an additional 7 lamps, the array is reconfigurable to achieve a line focus {{with an array of}} 30 × 6 kW metal halide lamps, calculated to achieve an average heat flux of 0. 32 MW/m 2 through a cylindrical focal surface with dimensions of 120 mm diameter and 1 m length. <b>Xue</b> <b>Dong,</b> Peter J.

40|$|We {{introduce}} the Camera Aware View-dEpendent Continuous Level Of Detail (CAVECLOD) polygon mesh representation. Several techniques recently {{have been developed}} that use a hierarchy of vertex split and merge operations to achieve continuous level of detail (LOD). These techniques exploit temporal coherence. However, when multiple cameras are simultaneously viewing a polygon mesh at continuous LOD, the exploitation of temporal coherence is difficult. The CAVECLOD mesh representation enables multiple cameras to simultaneously exploit temporal coherence. Texture coordinates and normal vectors are preserved and the algorithm uses Microsoft DirectX Vertex Buffers and Index Buffers for efficient rendering. Interactive frame rates are achieved on large models on commercially available hardware. i Acknowledgements I wish to acknowledge several people who helped me during {{the development of this}} thesis.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{assessments of}} {{the sensitivity of the}} performance of high flux solar simulators to the key variables of conical secondary concentrators for metal halide lamps, which offer complementary benefits compared with xenon arc lamps. The assessment is performed for both a single-lamp configuration and a seven-lamp array, each lamp close-coupled with its own elliptical reflector, and then aligned with a common conical secondary concentrator. The simulation of heat flux from both the single- and the seven-lamp systems was performed with the Monte Carlo ray-tracing code, which was validated with the experimental results from the single-lamp system. The calculated heat flux at the focal plane agrees with the measured peak flux to within 5 % and to within 13 % of the measured half width. Calculated results also show that the addition of the secondary concentrator to the single-lamp system can increase the peak flux by 294 % and the average flux by up to 93 % within a target of 100 mm in diameter, with a corresponding reduction in total power by 15 %. The conical secondary concentrator is less effective for a seven-lamp system, increasing the peak and average fluxes by 87. 3 % and 100 %, respectively, within 100 mm diameter focal plane, with a corresponding reduction in total power by 48 %. The model was then used to assess the sensitivity of the geometry of the secondary concentrators for both the single- and seven-lamp systems. The results show that the average heat flux is sensitive to the surface reflectance of the secondary concentrator, with the average flux decreasing almost linearly with the surface reflectance. The presence of the secondary cone greatly reduces the sensitivity of the concentrated heat flux to misalignment of the tilting angle of the elliptical reflector relative to the arc. <b>Xue</b> <b>Dong,</b> Graham J.

Brucea javanica oil contains oleic acid and linoleic acids that have been shown by animal and human studies to inhibit tumor formation. The microemulsion containing Brucea javanica oil, medium-chain triglyceride, soybean lecithin, Solutol®HS 15, PEG 400, and water was developed for docetaxel intravenous administration. A formulation with higher drug content, lower viscosity, and smaller particle size was developed. The droplet size distribution of the dispersed phase of the optimized microemulsion was 13. 5 nm, determined using a dynamic light scattering technique. The small droplet size enabled the microemulsion droplets to escape from uptake and phagocytosis by the reticuloendothelial system and increased the circulation time of the drug. The zeta potential was - 41. 3 mV. The optimized microemulsion was pale yellow, transparent, and non-opalescent in appearance. The value of the combination index was 0. 58, showing that there was a synergistic effect when docetaxel was combined with Brucea javanica oil. After a single intravenous infusion dose (10 mg/kg) in male Sprague Dawley rats, the area under the curve of the microemulsion was higher and the half-time was longer compared with that of docetaxel solution alone, and showed superior pharmacokinetic characteristics. These results indicate that this preparation of docetaxel in emulsion is likely to provide an excellent prospect for clinical tumor treatment.

The experimental results indicate that there is a metastable liquid miscibility gap in undercooled Fe-B melts. The network morphology consists of two interconnected subnetworks, which are αFe subnetwork and Fe₃B subnetwork respectively. The Fe-B network alloys have attractive mechanical properties. As micropore does not exist in the Fe₈₄B₁₆ network ingot, it is proposed that the solid/liquid interfaces of the two subnetworks advance together during solidification. In addition, there is no composition gradient of boron atoms at the growth front. A growth model is proposed to explain the results by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. It was found that there is special crystallinity in Fe₈₄B₁₆ network ingots.
