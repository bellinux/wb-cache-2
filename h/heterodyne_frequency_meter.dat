40|$|A method reduces {{sensitivity}} to noise in {{a signal from}} a laser heterodyne interferometer. The phase-locked loop (PLL) removes glitches that occur in a zero-crossing detector s output [that can happen if the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the heterodyne signal is low] {{by the use of}} an internal oscillator that produces a square-wave signal at a frequency that is inherently close to the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency.</b> It also contains phase-locking circuits that lock the phase of the oscillator to the output of the zero-crossing detector. Because the PLL output is an oscillator signal, it is glitch-free. This enables the ability to make accurate phase measurements in spite of low SNR, creates an immunity to phase error caused by shifts in the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency</b> (i. e. if the target moves causing Doppler shift), and maintains a valid phase even when the signal drops out for brief periods of time, such as when the laser is blocked by a stray object...|$|R

40|$|International Telemetering Conference Proceedings / October 27 - 30, 1997 / Riviera Hotel and Convention Center, Las Vegas, NevadaThis paper {{describes}} {{a kind of}} Microwave Digital Frequency Synthesizer used for S-band telemetry receivers. As well known many modern electronic systems employ a Frequency Synthesizer whose spectral purity is critical. The characteristics of a PLL (Phase-Locked Loop) Frequency Synthesizer, such as frequency resolution, phase noise, spurious suppression and switch time, should be compromised in our design. A <b>heterodyne</b> <b>Frequency</b> Synthesis is often considered as a good approach to solve the problem. But it is complicated in structure and circuit. A variable-reference-driven PLL Frequency Synthesizer was introduced which can give an improved trade-off among frequency resolution, phase noise, spurious suppression. In this paper the phase noise and spurious suppression characteristic of variable-reference-driven PLL Frequency Synthesizer is analyzed theoretically and {{compared with that of}} the <b>heterodyne</b> <b>Frequency</b> Synthesizer. For engineering application, a practical Microwave Digital Frequency Synthesizer used for telemetry receiver has been designed, which is characterized by simply structure, low phase noise and low spurious output.

40|$|Laboratories have collaborated {{over the}} past few years in an effort to provide {{accurate}} frequency calibration tables. This involves the use of <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements as. well as the analysis and fitting of the infrared spectra o f selected molecules. Of major interest are the linear triatomic molecules OCS and NzO, which together cover a sizeable portion of the 0 to 3000 cm-l region. Some <b>heterodyne</b> <b>frequency</b> measurements can be made by locking a tunable diode laser (TDL) to an absorption feature of OCS, foy example, and comparing the TDL frequency directly against a C 02 laser frequency standard. However, most recent measurements have required a transfer oscillator to relate a frequency synthesized from C 02 laser standards to the locked TDL frequency. The transfer oscillator for many of the measurements was a liquid-nitrogen-cooled CO laser. The transfer oscillator techniques and calibration tables resulting from the new frequency measurements on OCS and CS 2 are presented. Current status of calibration tables is given for an interim OCS atlas, an N 20 atlas, and several other molecules of interest. 1...|$|R
