40|$|Due to the {{development}} of intelligent demand-side management with automatic control, distributed populations of large residential loads, such as air conditioners (ACs) and <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> (EWHs), have the opportunities to provide effective demand-side ancillary services for load serving entities (LSEs) to reduce the emissions and network operating costs. Most present approaches are restricted to 1) the scenarios involving with efficiently scheduling the large number of appliances in real time, 2) the issues about evaluating the contributions of individual residents towards participating demand response (DR) program, and fairly distributing the rewards, and 3) the concerns on performing cost-effective demand reduction request (DRR) for LSEs with minimal rewards costs while not affecting their living comfortableness. Therefore, this paper presents an optimal framework for residential load aggregators (RLAs) which helps solve the problems mentioned above. Under this framework, RLAs are able to realize the DRR for LSEs to generate optimal control strategies over residential appliances quickly and efficiently. To residents, the framework is designed with probabilistic model of comfortableness, which minimizes the impact of DR program to their daily life. To LSEs, the framework helps minimize the total reward costs of performing DRRs. Moreover, the framework fairly and strategically distributes the financial rewards to residents, which may stimulate the potential capability of loads optimized and controlled by RLAs in demand side management.

The microgrid emulates the operation of a single family home with domestic hot water (DHW) consumption, a heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) system {{as well as the}} typical electric loads. An energy management strategy has been designed which optimizes the power exchanged with the grid profile in terms of peaks and fluctuations, in applications with high penetration levels of renewables. The proposed energy management strategy has been evaluated and validated experimentally in a full scale residential microgrid built in our Renewable Energy Laboratory, by means of continuous operation under real conditions.

40|$|Airport {{operations}} are heavily and repeatedly impacted by {{snow and ice}} during winter seasons. Considering the potential economic losses resulting from ice/snow-related flight delays and airport shutdowns, {{there is a significant}} need to maintain the runways and taxiways free of snow and ice at all times. Traditional snow removal systems that employ de-icers and anti-icers have the potential to generate Foreign Object Debris (FOD) and could cause damage to aircraft parts and the pavements. In addition, traditional snow plows and equipment have difficulty accessing critical airside {{operations are}}as such as the apron/gate areas. An emerging technology, referred to as the heated pavement systems (HPS) are promising alternatives to traditional snow removal systems. Although heated pavement systems have been used widely in European countries for airport snow removal, there are no practical applications in US, and their environmental impacts were unknown. The purpose of this research is to evaluate and quantify greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and energy consumptions of heated pavement systems applied in airfield in order to give decision makers a more informed view in snow removal application selections. As the very first research on environmental impacts of heated pavement systems in removing snow, this research includes three individual studies. Each one builds on the understanding of previous one. The first study uses life cycle assessment (LCA) to compare geothermal heated pavement system (GHPS) and traditional snow removal system applied in airport runway by evaluating their energy consumptions and GHG emissions. This study analyzes construction and operation phases of both snow removal systems. According to the limited data from previous studies, results show {{no significant differences between the}} construction phases of two snow removal systems. Also, airports show more interests in applying this new technology in airport apron area instead. The second study is focused on energy consumption, GHG emission, and costs of operating geothermal heated pavement system, hydronic heated pavement system using <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> and hydronic heated pavement system using natural gas boiler, in removing snow from apron area. Different coefficients of performances of geothermal heated pavement system operations are analyzed in order to evaluate the behaviors of the systems. The results show geothermal heated pavement system has the least environmental impacts, and when efficiency of natural gas boiler energy extraction is improved, it can be a better alternative for place where there is not enough geothermal energy from the environmental and economic perspectives. Based on the knowledge gained from previous two studies, the third study utilizes hybrid LCA to analyze energy consumptions and GHG emissions from apron snow removal operations. It evaluates the operations of four types of snow removal systems, hydronic heated pavement system using geothermal heat pump (HHPS-G), hydronic heated pavement system using natural gas furnace (HHPS-NG), electrically heated pavement system (EHPS), and traditional snow removal system (TSRS) applied in airport apron area. The life cycle analysis in this study is relatively more comprehensive than the previous two studies, it gives decision maker or airport manager a more informed view of operating heated pavement systems in removing snow from energy saving and global warming potential aspects. This overall research shows heated pavement systems have potential to substitute for traditional snow removal system in decreasing energy demand and GHG emissions during apron snow removal operations. Because the theoretical models used to calculate energy consumption and GHG emissions from different types of snow removal systems are still under development, the results reported from this research should be taken into account from a qualitative view, and more comprehensive assessments which include broader system boundary are required for future study...|$|E

30|$|Smart {{homes and}} {{buildings}} {{are no longer}} focused exclusively on realizing thermal and visual comfort. The trend in recent years goes {{in the direction of}} additionally integrating all kinds of devices found in the home, in particular consumer electronics and household appliances, in the automation networks. Two of the most important standards that support this integration are UPnP [7] and DLNA [8]. These electrical devices hold a major share of the total energy consumption in the household [9], most obviously already due to the large number found in present day homes. In fact, they contribute to the energy balance in multiple ways (e.g., a washing machine consumes hot <b>water</b> and <b>electrical</b> energy). For this reason, a smart home system must also deal with a maximized energy-efficient operation of the major appliances typically found in the household (i.e., white goods such as washing machines, dishwashers, refrigerators but also <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters).</b> Basically, the system must differentiate between two major types of appliances when reviewed under an energy perspective: devices that run continuously (e.g., the refrigerator) and those that are active (a)periodically (e.g., a dishwasher). For devices belonging to the first kind, only their operation may be optimized, that is, the amount of energy consumed during their regular use may be reduced. In case of a refrigerator, this could mean that its cooling power and thus the consumed energy are automatically adapted with regard to its content. If, for example, the refrigerator is filled 90 %, the cooling will require more electrical energy than {{at the beginning of the}} week when it is only filled 20 %. The amount of food could be detected automatically and used as an input parameter for a control strategy. This approach is also applicable to the latter category of devices, for example, a dishwasher programme (water temperature and duration) can of course be tailored to the amount and type of dishes inside. However, the ThinkHome system offers much more powerful tools for energy optimization. Once all appliances are integrated in the smart home system, the system is able to determine the most efficient starting time for this class of devices. For example, the start time of a dishwasher can be aligned with the weather forecast: if there is a high possibility for sunshine around noon, the energy for the dishwasher can be obtained from the photovoltaic system installed at the rooftop, which justifies a delay of the scheduled start (if there are no other constraints such as people coming home early). Similarly, the hot water needed for the washing machine can be generated by solar panels. While these examples represent the most sensible use of local energy producers, it can easily be extended to interact with smart grid and demand side management applications, as these deal with distribution or time adjustments of loads in general.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{developments}} in the Nordic power system have shown some negative trends that relate to all actors in the market. Overall increase in prices and periods with extremely high prices are observed and operational problems are encountered. These facts question the reliability and {{security of electricity supply}} and challenge the development of a smarter grid through which problems can be mitigated. Facing the situation described above the Norwegian Government has decided that advanced metering system (AMS) will be installed everywhere in the country by 2016. A main idea behind this action will be to stimulate energy savings and increase consumers’ knowledge on their electricity usage. The desired consequence of the installation, however, will be to open possibilities for demand response (change in consumers’ electricity usage patterns in response to price). This increased demand responsiveness can be a good solution to the existing operational problems. This thesis analyzes the effect of a demand response program that involves time-of-use pricing and remote load control of household heating equipment and sets the analysis in the general concept of efficiency in the electricity market and all the benefits associated with it. The main focus has been to estimate the influence that automatic steering of waterborne space heating and <b>electrical</b> <b>water</b> <b>heaters</b> in combination with a tariff compiled of peak, off-peak and spot prices will have on Norwegian households’ electricity usage based on a pilot testing remotely controlled load shifting at Malvik Everk. For this purpose I have used econometrics to estimate substitution elasticity and a price-elasticity equivalent measure and have tried to compare the extent to which electricity consumption has been reduced and moved to other periods throughout the day. The estimation of substitution elasticity does not provide any statistically significant proof of shift from peak to off-peak usage as a response to prices charged. These results indicate that load reduction should be attributed specifically to RLC and not to price changes as prices and usage do not follow a particular correlation pattern during the hours neighboring the predefined peak periods. Price elasticity’s estimates prove to be highly significant and show that load during hours of RLC has been reduced simultaneously with the customers being charged peak prices. The resulting elasticities equal to - 0. 47 and - 0. 10 account for a much higher extent of price-responsive behavior as compared to previous studies that analyzed price elasticities. Results from demand response based pilots such as the one at Malvik Everk provide some important insights on what the opportunities for demand curtailment can be and on how load can be rescheduled. Estimation results indicate a big potential for RLC to contribute for reduction of consumption during hours corresponding with high-price periods. However, the true success of demand response programs will depend mainly on the introduction of adequate technological solutions, correct electricity pricing methods and a sound knowledge of the desired effects and their consequences...|$|R

The performance of the two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> is affected by the water temperature. It is important that the ASHPWH operate at a right temperature of the water. A solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> with 4 m 2 flat-plate collector assisted by a 1. 5 kW ASHPWH is studied in this paper. The results show that both the collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> and the COP of the ASHPWH system decreases as the water temperature increases. The highest and lowest collector efficiency of the solar <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> are 54. 4 % and 45. 6 % respectively. The COP of the ASHPWH system ranges from 6. 48 to 2. 61 as the water temperature increases. Operating sequences of these two kinds of <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> affect solar energy utilization ratio and the power input of the ASHPWH system. 1...|$|R

Their solar {{collectors}} are installed outside dwellings, typically {{on the roof}} or walls or nearby, and the potable {{hot water storage tank}} is typically a pre-existing or new conventional <b>water</b> <b>heater,</b> or a <b>water</b> <b>heater</b> specifically designed for solar thermal.|$|R

Bradford White claims this approach ensures {{proper and safe}} installation of its <b>water</b> <b>heaters,</b> and also prevents code violations.|$|R
