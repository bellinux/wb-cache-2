50|$|Palafoxia integrifolia is a {{herbaceous}} annual {{plant with}} pinkish-white disc flowers arranged in inflorescences. It has glossy, alternating leaves which are <b>elogate</b> {{on the lower}} portion of the stems and more linear at the top.The stems of P. integrifolia are less woody than other species of palafox, making it prone to drooping.|$|E
40|$|A {{significant}} {{fraction of}} living sea urchin species have completely or partially eliminated the pluteus larval stage and instead develop directly from embryo to adult. Direct developing sea urchins develop from large buoyant eggs. We present data {{to show that}} evolution of these large eggs is accompanied by the evolution of spermatozoa with <b>elogate</b> heads, {{in contrast with the}} conical sperm heads typical of most echinoids. Two congeneric Australian species, Heliocidaris tuberculata, which develops via a pluteus, and H. erythogramma, a direct developer, were investigated in detail. The sperm of H. erythrogramma have an elongate head (11 μm in length) as compared to the conical sperm head (5. 6 μm) of H. tuberculata. Electrophoretic analysis of the sperm histones indicates that no unusual histones or protamines are associated with modified head morphology. Genome sizes were determined by flow cytometry. H. erythrogramma has a haploid genome size of 1. 3 pg as compared to a haploid genome size of 0. 95 pg for H. tuberculata. Other direct developing echinoids have elongate sperm heads, and co‐evolution of gametes is indicated as a common feature of evolution of direct development in echinoids. The most extreme case, the direct developing cidaroid sea urchin, Phyllacanthus parvispinus, possesses the longest and narrowest sperm head (20 μm × 1 μm) ever observed in an echinoid.

50|$|They are <b>elogated</b> {{in shape}} and mainly silver or golden-silver in color, {{sometimes}} with yellow fins (especially pelvic and anal fins) and dark horizontal lines along the body. Depending on the species involved, they reach lengths of up to 28 to(-) 45 cm.|$|R
5000|$|The {{coordination}} of alkynes to transition metals {{is similar to}} that of alkenes. The bonding is described by the Dewar-Chatt-Duncanson model. Upon complexation the C-C bond <b>elogates</b> and the alkynyl carbon bends away from 180º. For example, in the phenylpropyne complex Pt(PPh3)2(C2)Ph(Me), the C-C distance is 1.277(25) vs 1.20 Å for a typical alkyne. The C-C-C angle distorts 40° from linearity. [...] Because the bending induced by complexation, strained alkynes such as cycloheptyne and cyclooctyne are stabilized by complexation.|$|R
