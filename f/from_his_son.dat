Carol refused to accept his mother's advice to take Helen back and never sought Marie's counsel during his reign, thus making the already existing breach between mother and son complete.|$|E
5|$|There is some {{documentation}} {{that allows}} us to reconstruct a genealogy of artists after Gasparo, <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Simone onwards. Though little information is available about Simone, it appears that no works are attributed directly to him; rather, he appears to have worked as a builder when outside his father's workshop. In a bill dated 1534, Simone declares his age as 38, born in 1496, and around twenty years of age on his father's death. He also cites his firstborn son Gasparo, twelve years old, in turn a sculptor, his wife Catlina, sister of the engraver Andrea Testi of Manerbio. A daughter of Gasparo, Giulia, became the wife of an artisan potter, while a third child, Giovanni Antonio, was a qualified goldsmith, as indicated in a deed relating Stefano Lamberti and Bernardino delle Croci.|$|E

Despite {{not wanting to be}} {{involved}} with the case, already dealing with a divorce and estrangement <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> Daniel, Eric reluctantly joins Kerry and Sergeant Daniel Rigg in leading a SWAT team to the factory which produced the lock from Marks' trap.

Some generations later, the part of the estate containing Shepton Mallet was sold to a relative, Sir Thomas Gournay. His son, also called Thomas, participated in the murder of Edward II and his estates were confiscated by Edward III in 1337. The family regained favour with the king some years later and the lands were returned. When Mathew de Gournay died childless in 1406, the estate reverted to the Crown, before being granted to Sir John de Tiptoft. It was again confiscated <b>from</b> <b>his</b> <b>son</b> by Henry VI during the Wars of the Roses (when the family sided with Edward IV), but was restored to Sir John's grandson, Edward Tiptoft, when Edward IV regained the throne. He died without issue, and there followed a succession of grants and reversions until Glastonbury Abbey was dissolved by Henry VIII, and its lands, including Shepton Mallet, were granted to the Duchy of Cornwall in 1536.|$|E
