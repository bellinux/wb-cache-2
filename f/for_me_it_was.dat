I knew exactly where I stood with him, and I went away with a new belief, {{in terms of where}} I wanted to head.

"set in Queens and Greenwich Village, another New York {{neighborhood}} book, {{very much}} {{about the life of}} the city... writing about Greenwich Village in 1958 was really a jump <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> as much of an imaginative leap as any of the more fantastical things I've done. But really exciting, too." ...|$|E
500|$|Aguilera further commented {{about the}} event with USA Today, [...] "When you're {{part of a}} pop phenomenon, {{you have so many}} {{opinions}} shoved down your throat. People try to tell you what you should do, how you should act, what you should wear, who you should be with. At the time things started happening <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> popular to be the squeaky-clean, cookie-cutter pop singer. But that role didn't speak to me, because it's so boring and superficial".|$|E

500|$|Michels {{stated that}} the victory was proof that Ajax could match teams in Europe: [...] "The Liverpool game was for me an {{important}} moment to be acknowledged and recognised internationally. Not only the first game, because {{that could have been}} an accident – with the weather conditions etc. No, the performance we achieved in Liverpool under bad circumstances – I've never seen such a hectic situation. We drew that game 2–2 and never really had problems. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the proof that we were at the international level." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me." [...] He later bluntly {{concluded}} that [...] "it's the only episode that I kind of wish we hadn't done." ...|$|E
500|$|Hergé's main assistant, Bob de Moor, {{showed an}} {{interest}} in completing the book following Hergé's death. In de Moor's words, [...] "Personally I {{would have loved to}} finish Alph-Art. It would have been a tribute to Hergé. Fanny Remi asked me to finish it, and I began work on it, but after a few months she changed her mind. I didn't insist, but <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> logical that there was a studio, there were artists in the studio, Casterman asked for it to be finished, there were twenty-three finished books, that one story was not finished; so I had to finish it." ...|$|E

500|$|An {{offensive}} minded player {{throughout his}} amateur and minor professional career, St. Louis {{was forced into}} a checking-line role by the Calgary Flames. He credits the experience for rounding out his game: [...] "I played a true third-line role, killing penalties and playing against the other team's top lines. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> like a five-month crash course on developing my defensive game. My whole life, I had been an offensive player, and suddenly I was {{in the role of}} trying to be smart without the puck. I think those fifty-six games helped me develop into a complete player." ...|$|E
500|$|Whedon {{feels the}} episode's title is {{pertinent}} to the storylines, explaining that {{the aim was to}} examine the desires {{at the core of the}} central characters, including Will's desire to perform, Rachel's desire to find her biological mother and Artie's desire to walk again. He stated: [...] "I was really lucky because there's a real phonetic coherence of the episode that brought them all together on an emotional level. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> just a question that they dovetailed and didn't feel random and you understood why these three stories were all in the same show." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{a period}} of illness Verdi began work on Macbeth in September 1846. He {{dedicated}} the opera to Barezzi: [...] "I have long intended to dedicate an opera to you, as {{you have been a}} father, a benefactor and a friend <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> a duty I should have fulfilled sooner if imperious circumstances had not prevented me. Now, I send you Macbeth, which I prize above all my other operas, and therefore deem worthier to present to you." [...] In 1997 Martin Chusid wrote that Macbeth {{was the only one of}} Verdi's operas of his [...] "early period" [...] to remain regularly in the international repertoire, although in the 21st century Nabucco has also entered the lists.|$|E

[...] A video tape, titled Dream Chaser, was released on January 22, 2002, which included Simpson's biography, music videos, behind-the-scenes looks at [...] "Irresistible" [...] and [...] "A Little Bit", and footage from the tour.

500|$|Jenna Fischer {{found her}} character's {{break-up}} scene with Roy [...] "really dark," [...] {{as she is}} friends with David Denman outside of the show. She explained, [...] "To see him turn like that, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> even more shocking because I know him as a big teddy bear. He played it so well and I think that cliffhanger of 'I’m gonna kill Jim Halpert' {{is one of the}} best last lines of our episodes ever." [...] "Cocktails" [...] included recurring guest star Michael Patrick McGill as Kenny Anderson, who called working on The Office [...] "a blast." [...] Other guest stars included Dan Cole as Dan Gore, Owen Daniels as the Wallaces' son, and Jean Villepique as Rachel Wallace.|$|E
500|$|Television Without Pity and Steve Marsi of TV Fanatic {{praised the}} return of Georgina, stating [...] "Michelle {{had some of the}} show's funniest {{dialogue}} in a long time.

[...] When reviewing the final scene, Marsi commended the appearance of the positive pregnancy test to the audience, calling the it [...] "Quite the cliffhanger to leave us with after a finale that was already pretty darn entertaining. The show went out on a high note and next season could be even better." [...] New York Magazine commented on the pregnancy test, insisting that [...] "we’re pretending that positive pregnancy test didn’t exist." ...|$|E

500|$|Lyrically, [...] "Falling Down" [...] {{is said to}} be {{in regards}} to accusations of {{wrongdoing}} and has a sense of longing for a non-benefiting relationship. However in an interview, Gomez stated, during an interview that the song ultimately is a ridicule of the Hollywood life and fame, that was the meaning behind [...] "Smile for the camera, 'cause they're all about to trash ya." [...] Gomez further elaborated on the concept of the song on an interview with Just Jared Jr., saying, It's basically about Hollywood and what people think about it and essentially how plastic it is sometimes. It's fun and I think girls can relate to it somewhat, <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> because of Hollywood but it can really relate to a mean girl, an ex-boyfriend, to whoever.|$|E
500|$|Albert Brooks {{plays the}} foul-mouthed, morose Bernie Rose. When Refn {{suggested}} him, Gosling agreed, but thought the actor {{would not be}} up for playing a character who is violent and sullen, or for appearing in a film {{that he did not}} work on himself. Brooks accepted the role to go against type, and because he loved that Bernie was not a cliché. [...] "There are six people you could always get to play this kind of part, and I like that the director was thinking outside of the box. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> an opportunity to act outside the box. I liked that this mobster had real style. Also, he doesn't {{get up in the morning}} thinking about killing people. He's sad about it. Upset about it. It's a case of, 'Look what you made me do.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed {{comments from}} TV Squad, with Brett Love commenting that [...] "the suspended license plot {{was a little}} thin, but that's forgivable given {{that this was the}} b-story for the episode, and there are only 22 minutes to work with." [...] Love comments positively on the Stewie and Brian relationship in the episode, commenting that, [...] "the Stewie and Brian story is what made the episode <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> very well done, right down to the goofy little details." [...] IGN commented that, [...] "...for Family Guy to have a great episode, it takes a good story and humorous [...] "manatee" [...] gags. [...] "Road to Rupert" [...] was able to deliver on both these fronts, with the majority of the episode's attention focused on Stewie and Brian's road story, meshed with many laugh out loud gags." ...|$|E

500|$|... "Take a Bow" [...] was {{recorded}} at The Hit Factory studios, New York, and was mastered and mixed at Sterling Sound Studios, New York. Babyface recalled {{that he was}} nervous about recording with Madonna, since he feared that Madonna was a [...] "perfectionist" [...] in the studio, and that would ultimately be time consuming for the whole process. However, {{it was one of}} the fastest recording and mixing. The song was backed by a full orchestra and was also the first time that Babyface had worked with live strings. He recalled that using strings in the song was [...] " [...] suggestion, and it was Nellee Hooper who actually [...] She had worked with them before but <b>for</b> <b>me</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a new experience". Along with Hooper, Jessie Leavey, Craig Armstrong and Susie Katiyama also worked on the strings and conducting.|$|E

Gunn noted that the film would be connected to [...] Several other objects of significance appear in the Collector's museum, including a Chitauri from The Avengers and a Dark Elf from Thor: The Dark World, among other characters. About their appearances Gunn said, [...] "There's {{a lot of stuff}} in the Collector's Museum. And <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> mostly just really fun. As a Marvel fan, giving the actual fans something that they can freeze frame on their Blu-Ray at home and just kind of pick out everything that's in there. So there are, I mean, seriously all those boxes have something interesting in them, so it's pretty fun."

500|$|Rob Bowman used {{a couple}} of {{specific}} camera techniques for the scenes on board the Stargazer during Picard's hallucinations. A steadicam attached to a cameraman was used to show a slight unsteadiness, {{and each of the}} Stargazer crew members were filmed individually on the bridge against a smoke background before being superimposed together. He explained, [...] "we went dark in a lot of scenes and we did different angles and things the show hadn't done yet. <b>For</b> <b>me,</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a real creative stretch and it felt great for the show." [...] The bridge itself was a re-dress of the film-era Klingon Bird of Prey bridge. The term [...] "Picard Maneuver" [...] was later used offscreen to refer informally to Patrick Stewart's habit of tugging his uniform shirt down, and the Battle of Maxia itself was described in the first chapter of the pre-TNG era novel The Buried Age.|$|E
