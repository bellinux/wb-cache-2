The cap <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> constructed, incorporating two beams from the original cap frame that were fit to be reused. The cap <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> completed in autumn 1982. It had been constructed upside down and a mobile crane was used to turn it over and place the windshaft into position.|$|E
5|$|Copenhagen's urban {{development}} {{in the first half}} of the 20th century was heavily influenced by industrialisation. After World War II, Copenhagen Municipality adopted Fordism and repurposed its medieval centre to facilitate private automobile infrastructure in response to innovations in transport, trade and communication. Copenhagen’s spacial planning in this time <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> characterised by the separation of land uses: an approach which requires residents to travel by car to access facilities of different uses.|$|E

5|$|Even {{after the}} change in effects companies, Yuricich {{continued}} to provide many of the matte paintings used in the film, having previously worked on The Day the Earth Stood Still, Ben-Hur, North by Northwest and Logan's Run. The paintings were combined with live action after a selected area of the <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> matted out; the blue Earth sky over Yellowstone, for example was replaced with a red-hued Vulcan landscape. More than 100 such paintings were used.|$|E
5|$|Harvie Krumpet {{was filmed}} in Melbourne over 15 months between October 2001 and January 2003. The film {{was shot in}} {{sequence}} in three-month blocks, interspersed with three-month blocks of building sets and models. Production began in Elliott's garage and subsequently took place in three separate studios, moving three times {{in order to accommodate}} the growing size of the sets. It was shot on Super 16 mm film using a Bolex camera. Each individual <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> animated, meaning that an average of 3–5 seconds' worth of film was produced in each full day of filming.|$|E
5|$|Motorcycle {{engineer}} Norbert Riedel {{recognized the}} need for a simple and economical light motorcycle during Germany's recovery from the Second World War and began to design one. By the summer of 1947, a prototype frame had been built and tested. The spine <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> made from 40mm steel tubing, as were the steering head, the single-sided front fork, and the single-sided swingarm. The wheels were interchangeable, and were mounted from the left on stub axles attached to the suspension on the right.|$|E

5|$|Nicholas Sander, a Catholic recusant born c. 1530, was {{committed}} to deposing Elizabeth I and re-establishing Catholicism in England. In his De Origine ac Progressu schismatis Anglicani (The Rise and Growth of the Anglican Schism), published in 1585, {{he was the first}} to write that Anne had six fingers on her right hand. Since physical deformities were generally interpreted as a sign of evil, it is unlikely that Anne Boleyn would have gained Henry's romantic attention had she had any. Upon exhumation in 1876, no abnormalities were discovered. Her <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> described as delicate, approximately 5'3", with finely formed, tapering fingers.|$|E
5|$|The building's {{structural}} steel <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> also {{a first for}} the city. It was covered in grey limestone from Saint-Marc-des-Carrières and Queenston. Due to the rapid construction, Saint-Marc-des-Carrières was unable to supply enough stone {{to keep up with}} demand on the building site, resulting in the use of Queenston as an additional source. Saint-Marc-des-Carrières limestone is a pearly grey, and becomes a pale beige with age, while Queenston limestone has pink calcite streaks from crinoid fossils and takes a chamois tint as it ages.|$|E
5|$|The species {{used for}} the hull planks was not {{positively}} identified but {{is thought to be}} Amoora of the Meliaceae family. The timber for the frames was similarly not definitively determined, although one <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> probably of Amoora or of the Afzelia genus of the Fabaceae family. Afzelia is interesting in that the three main species A. africana, A. bipindensis and A. pachyloba are mostly found in a small part of Africa, stretching from the mid-western coast in a thin band towards the east coast and stopping short of it by a couple of hundred miles.|$|E

He reached the final without falling behind even once, and defeated Barry Hawkins 18–12 to win his fifth world title. O'Sullivan's break of 103 in the 15th <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> his 128th century break at the Crucible Theatre, breaking Stephen Hendry's record of 127 Crucible centuries. During the final he extended the record to 131 century breaks. O'Sullivan became the only player to score six century breaks in a World Championship final. He also became only the third player to retain his title at the Crucible after Steve Davis and Stephen Hendry.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, a {{temporary}} visitor security screening center {{was added to}} the east entrance of the Washington Monument {{in the wake of the}} September 11 attacks. The one-story facility was designed to reduce the ability of a terrorist attack on the interior of the monument, or an attempt to seize and hold it. Visitors obtained their timed-entry tickets from the Monument Lodge east of the memorial, and passed through metal detectors and bomb-sniffing sensors prior to entering the monument. After exiting the monument, they passed through a turnstile to prevent them from re-entering. This facility, a one-story cube of wood around a metal <b>frame,</b> <b>was</b> intended to be temporary until a new screening facility could be designed.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1997, a storm blew out the main two-story window {{at the front of}} the building, and the window's wooden <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> rotten, cracked and could not be saved. The window {{remained}} unrepaired, which left the sanctuary open to the elements for a month before the congregation, down to approximately 100 members, asked for assistance. The congregants had, by then, long held services in a smaller room, using the sanctuary only on the High Holidays. The New York Landmarks Conservancy's Endangered Buildings fund gave $2,500 for a temporary metal window, and assisted in getting approval from the Landmarks Preservation Commission for the work required to repair the damage, but the congregation did not have the $10,000 required to pay for it. Beth Hamedrash Hagodol received an additional $2,000 from the New York Landmarks Conservancy's Sacred Sites program in 1998 for a conditions survey. In 1999 a second application for National Historical designation was made, this time successful; the building was deemed significant at the local level, and was added to the National Register of Historic Places on November 30.|$|E

5|$|Inside Cloud Gates {{polished}} exterior shell {{are several}} steel structures {{that keep the}} sculpture standing. The first structural pieces, two type 304 stainless steel rings, were put into place in February 2004. As construction continued, crisscrossing pipe trusses were assembled between the two rings. The trusses and supporting structures were only present for the construction phases. The finished sculpture has no inner bracing. The supporting structural components were designed and constructed {{to ensure that no}} specific point was overloaded, and to avoid producing unwanted indentations on the exterior shell. The <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> also designed to expand and contract with the sculpture as temperatures fluctuate. As a result, the two large rings supporting the sculpture move independently of each other, allowing the shell to move independently of the rings.|$|E
5|$|The {{capture of}} the Dutch ships {{was the end of}} the final attempt by a {{continental}} nation to land troops in Ireland during the French Revolutionary Wars and the Napoleonic Wars that followed them. Furie and Waakzaamheid were both purchased for the Royal Navy, Furie returned to her pre-war name of Wilhelmina and Waakzaamheid under the same name. The corvette was regraded and the number of guns aboard were reduced to 20 as her <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> not deemed strong enough to carry 24. Richard King remained in Sirius until 1802, and subsequently commanded the ship of the line HMS Achille, participating at the Battle of Trafalgar in 1805.|$|E
5|$|The cloth {{on which}} the work was painted had been lined with a more finely woven piece of linen and restretched, {{probably}} by the same person who stretched and lined the other works identified with the larger altarpiece. It was placed under glass, probably in the early 19th century and certainly before its acquisition by the National Gallery (Eastlake noted that it was under glass in 1858). The piece was evidently sent rolled and unframed to its patron. The brown border painted along the four sides indicates where the frame should be positioned when it is added to its final support. The row of rust-stained nail holes running {{along the top of}} the cloth is evidence that the <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> eventually positioned within the pictorial field, at a point far lower than Bouts had intended. This low framing protected a portion of the canvas from deterioration and allows us to see some of the colours as they would have originally appeared.|$|E
5000|$|In the OSI {{model of}} {{computer}} networking, a <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> the {{protocol data unit}} at the data link layer. <b>Frames</b> <b>are</b> {{the result of the}} final layer of encapsulation before the data is transmitted over the physical layer.

5|$|In the 1996/1997 season, O'Sullivan won two ranking titles: the Asian Classic by {{narrowly}} defeating Brian Morgan 9–8 in the final, and the German Open by defeating Alain Robidoux 9–7 in the final. O'Sullivan again {{reached the}} final of the Charity Challenge, where he faced Stephen Hendry in a first-to-nine frame match. O'Sullivan trailed 2–8 before winning six frames in a row to level at 8–8, before Hendry won the deciding frame with a maximum break. At the Masters, O'Sullivan reached his third consecutive final, where he faced Steve Davis. After O'Sullivan took the first two frames with back-to-back century breaks of 116 and 113, the third <b>frame</b> <b>was</b> disrupted by a streaker, Lianne Croft. Davis later stated that the streaking incident affected O'Sullivan's concentration, allowing him back into the match and the afternoon session ended all-square at 4–4. O'Sullivan began the evening session by winning four frames in 49 minutes to take an 8–4 lead, but Davis fought back to win the next six frames and clinch the title with a 10–8 victory. On 21 April 1997, while playing Mick Price {{in the first round of}} the World Championship, O'Sullivan made the fastest ever competitive maximum break in 5 minutes and 20 seconds, an average of one shot every 8.8 seconds. This was also O'Sullivan's first maximum break in professional competition. He exited the World Championship in the second round, losing 12–13 against Darren Morgan. O'Sullivan also won the non-ranking European League, defeating Hendry 10–8 in the final.|$|E

30|$|We {{implement}} a simulation model using the ns {{to evaluate the}} performance of Bypass-AODV. Free Space propagation model is used to predict the signal power strength at the receiver side. The signal strength is used {{to determine if the}} <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> received successfully. ns mainly uses three thresholds to determine whether a <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> received correctly by the receiver. If the signal strength of the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> less than the carrier sensing threshold (CSThresh), the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> discarded in the PHY module and will not be visible to the MAC layer. If the signal strength of the received <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> stronger than the reception threshold (RxThresh), the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> received correctly. Otherwise, the <b>frame</b> <b>is</b> tagged as corrupted and the MAC layer will discard it. When multiframes are received simultaneously by one mobile node, it calculates the ratio of the strongest frame's signal strength to the sum of other frames' signal strengths. If it is larger than the capturing threshold (CPThresh), the <b>frame</b> will <b>be</b> received correctly and other <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> ignored. Otherwise, all <b>frames</b> <b>are</b> collided and discarded. In our simulation, we choose TCP instead of UDP to evaluate the performance of our proposed protocol against large data packets and excessive overhead. The IEEE 802.11 MAC standard [15] and the TCP New-Reno are used at the MAC and TCP layers, respectively. The transmission rate is assumed to be constant at 1 [*]Mbps.|$|R
