40|$|Ranking Member McKeon, for {{inviting}} me {{to speak to you}} today on these important issues facing working families. My name is Heather Boushey and I’m a Senior Economist at the Center for American Progress Action Fund. For over a generation now, families have been struggling to figure how to balance work and responsibilities at home. Most children—over 70 percent—grow up in a family with either a working single parent or with two parents who both work. Because both men and women are overwhelmingly likely to be working, most families do not have a stay-athome parent or anyone available to provide care if a family member falls ill. The recession is exacerbating these challenges for families. In my comments today, I want to lay out how the recession is affecting families and how it makes the need for family-friendly workplace policies ever more urgent. The recession—so far—is leading to higher unemployment among men than women: As of December 2008 —which is the latest data available—men have lost four out of every five <b>jobs</b> <b>shed</b> since the recession began in December 2007. This means that in millions of U. S. households, a woman is supporting the family. ...|$|R

Latest employment data released last week confirm that the much-heralded end of the recession remains {{little more than a}} technicality. This is as true for the Auckland economy as it is for its national counterpart. The net 13, 000 <b>jobs</b> <b>shed</b> from the Auckland economy over the past year mean annual employment contracted by nearly 3 percent over that period. Looking ahead, hopes of an export-led recovery for the New Zealand economy have been dashed by an exchange rate that defies any rational assessment of the fundamentals. Consequently, the short-term outlook for the Auckland economy is best described as unstable. Clearly, the next few months will be better than the first half of 2009, but there will be little to celebrate.

40|$|There is {{a popular}} {{perception}} that recent trade liberalisation in South Africa has been bad for jobs. This paper examines this by investigating the relationship between tariffs, both levels and changes, and wages in the manufacturing sector. This is done through matching individual labour force data with industry level tariff data and estimating Mincerian earnings equations. The results suggest that an identical individual in a low tariff sector earns {{more than one in}} a high tariff sector. Furthermore, wages are higher in those sectors that have undergone greater liberalisation. These results are robust to controlling for sector characteristics as well as selectivity into manufacturing jobs. Contrary to popular perception, these results suggest that trade liberalisation is good for wages. Two possible explanations of this positive relationship are investigated. The first is that trade liberalisation has resulted in low wage <b>job</b> <b>shedding</b> in those sectors that have liberalised. There is some evidence that this is occurring. The second is that wages in liberalising sectors have risen relative to sectors where tariffs have remained the same – the evidence provided suggests that this may also be an explanation. ...|$|E

The sample was separated into a high wage paying North Coast and lower wage paying South Coast. Typically farmers were unable to distinguish between the impact of the Sectoral Determination and other labour laws. Results indicate that the impact of the legislation is similar in each region. No respondents reported mass retrenchment, but <b>job</b> <b>shedding</b> is disguised by not replacing workers (especially unskilled workers) that leave the farm. A sizeable number of growers (17 per cent on the South Coast and 44 per cent on the North Coast) have reduced the working week to 27 hours (or 36 hours in the Felixton Mill Group Area) enabling them to pay wages on an hourly, rather than a weekly basis. This strategy reduces the effective wage. About 40 per cent of growers have reduced the in-kind benefits to their workers. About half of respondents indicated that they are likely to increase their use of seasonal and contract labour in future.

GDP growth and job creation remained weak through late-1992. Unemployment rose from 5.4% in January 1990 to 6.8% in March 1991, and continued to rise until peaking at 7.8% in June 1992.

40|$|As well {{as being}} bad {{economic}} policy, the job cuts promised by the Liberals are likely to prove an electoral liability, argues John Spoehr NOT surprisingly, the South Australian Liberal Party has attracted considerable criticism for proposing to cut 4000 public servant jobs if elected on 18 March. A close examination {{of the implications of}} the cuts suggests that the choice of job cuts to fund their election promises is bad public policy. It is worth remembering that when the Liberals were last in office they cut public sector employment by over 20, 000 jobs. The loss of thousands of highly skilled people depleted the public service leaving it ill prepared to deal with the consequences of a rapidly ageing public sector workforce. Recent growth in public sector employment has been essential to help counter an accelerating retirement rate and ensure that widespread skill shortages don’t undermine the capacity of the state government to deliver public services over coming years. The cuts will also contribute to a significant rise in unemployment in South Australia. The policy imperative {{over the next few years}} is not to cut jobs but to design and implement a State Public Sector Workforce Development strategy that pursues an ambitious recruitment target for young people and focuses on the retention rather than loss of mature age public servants. Over the decade to 2001 South Australian public sector employment declined dramatically. This was largely due to the heavy <b>job</b> <b>shedding</b> associated with budgetary cuts in health and education expenditure in the mid 1990 s and the downsizing that occurred during the corporatisation and eventual privatisation of a range of state government business enterprises. The number of state public sector employees declined from 115, 700 in June 1991 to 82, 953 in June 2001. This represents a reduction of around 25 per cent or 32, 800 employees over the decade. After a decade of decline public sector employment rose by around 7 per cent over the 2002 - 05 period from 83, 821 to 89, 979. Public sector employment has declined significantly as a proportion of the South Australian workforce from 18. 1 per cent in 1991 to 12. 1 per cent by 2005. The South Australian public sector is ageing at a faster rate than the South Australian workforce and the proportion of 15 - 24 year olds is shrinking alarmingly. The gap between the median age of the South Australian public sector and the South Australian workforce has doubled over the last decade or so. In 1991 the median age of the public sector workforce was 38. 5 compared to 35. 7 for the SA workforce. By 2005 the median age of the public sector was 45. 0 compared to 40. 0 for the SA workforce. The proportion of 15 to 24 year olds in the SA public sector declined from 10. 9 per cent compared to 20. 2 per cent for the workforce as whole in 1991 to 5. 9 per cent compared to 18. 4 per cent for the workforce as a whole in 2005. The divergence in the representation of 15 - 24 year olds in the SA public sector is a serious concern given the recruitment and retention challenges it faces. This age profile suggests that a significant proportion of public sector employees are likely to consider retirement over the next five years. Nearly 5 per cent or around 4300 public servants are over the age of 60. The proposed cuts are sending the wrong signal at the wrong time. The cuts would result in public sector employment declining significantly, by around 4. 5 per cent, from 89, 979 to 85, 979 persons. The losses will cost more than they save in the short term. The separation package costs associated with the cuts is likely to be in the order of $ 250 m to $ 300 m based on an average separation package of around $ 70, 000. As well as providing a range of public services, public investment has important economic and employment benefits. Investment in public services generally has higher value-added multipliers than investments in many other industries including motor vehicles, textiles and electronic equipment. Put simply public services generate more employment per dollar than any other industry. Using employment multipliers the Australian Institute for Social Research estimated the flow on impacts of the Liberal Party’s proposed cuts to public sector employment for the Public Service Association of South Australia. The cuts are likely to equate to expenditure cuts in the budget of between $ 150 m and $ 200 m per year. The proposed 4000 reduction in the number of public servants will result in an increase in unemployment in South Australia. Currently there are around 39, 900 unemployed people in South Australia. A significant proportion of public servants who lose their jobs as result of the proposed reductions are likely to become unemployed. Studies of the impact of redundancy on unemployment suggest that around 30 per cent of those made redundant are likely to become unemployed for six months or more, Unemployment in South Australia is likely to increase by around 2900 as a result of the cuts. Overall unemployment would rise from 39, 300 to 42, 240, resulting in the unemployment rate rising from 5. 0 to around 5. 4 per cent. It should be noted that cuts that occur outside the CBD will have a disproportionate impact in those regions experiencing unemployment rates above the state average. There is no economic or financial imperative to cut public sector employment in South Australia. Government finances are robust and the South Australian economy is buoyant. Furthermore the ageing of the public sector creates an imperative to recruit and retain more public servants rather than reduce the public sector workforce. The public sector faces the emergence of widespread skill shortages that have the potential to erode the quantity and quality of government service provision over the next five to ten years. The ageing of the public sector workforce necessitates the development of effective retention rather than separation strategies. In this context the proposed 4000 cut to public sector employment in South Australia will be counterproductive. It would result in an increase in unemployment reversing the recent sustained decline in the unemployment rate. As {{well as being}} bad economic policy the cuts are likely to prove to be an electoral liability. • John Spoehr was commissioned by the Public Service Association of South Australia to examine the impact of the proposed cuts.
