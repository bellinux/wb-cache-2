He spent one year there, and then, in 1931, he matriculated at the University of Michigan in the United States to study architecture. [...] Although the Wallenberg family was rich, he worked at odd jobs in his free time and joined other young male students as a passenger rickshaw handler at Chicago's Century of Progress. He used his vacations to explore the United States, with hitchhiking being his preferred method of travel. About his experiences, {{he wrote to his}} grandfather saying, [...] "When you travel like a hobo, everything’s different. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> alert the whole time. You’re in close contact with new people every day. Hitchhiking gives you training in diplomacy and tact." ...|$|E
2500|$|If the two {{supplementary}} angles are adjacent (i.e. {{have a common}} vertex and share just one side), their non-shared sides form a straight line. Such angles are called a linear pair of angles. However, {{supplementary angles}} do not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> same line, and can be separated in space. [...] For example, adjacent angles of a parallelogram are supplementary, and opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral (one whose vertices all fall on a single circle) are supplementary.|$|E
2500|$|By 1935, film historians {{were already}} noting {{the loss of}} the industry's early studio facilities, many of which had become ghost towns, but the Warner Bros. Sunset studios were still running at full production:"Warner Brothers Studio on Sunset Boulevard is far from dead. Probably more {{shooting}} is done there than at the First National plant Warners absorbed, for there are four modern stages there. But the ghost stage is the one on which history was made -- Stage 3, on which the first all-talking picture was made. It is a small stage, though and sentiment -- except as it applied to relatives who <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> payroll or else supported some other way -- has {{very little to do with}} making pictures." ...|$|E

2500|$|MTV {{rejected}} {{other black}} artists' videos, such as Rick James' [...] "Super Freak", {{because they did}} not fit the channel's carefully selected album-oriented rock format at the time. The exclusion enraged James; he publicly advocated the addition of more black artists' videos on the channel. Rock legend David Bowie also questioned MTV's lack of black artists during an on-air interview with VJ Mark Goodman in 1983. MTV's original head of talent and acquisition, Carolyn B. Baker, who was black, had questioned why the definition of music had to be so narrow, as had a few others outside the network. [...] "The party line at MTV was that we weren't playing black music because of the 'research, said Baker years later. [...] "But the research was based on ignorance... we were young, we were cutting edge. [...] We didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> cutting edge of racism." [...] Nevertheless, it was Baker who had personally rejected Rick James' video for Super Freak [...] "because there were half-naked women in it, and it was a piece of crap. [...] As a black woman, I did not want that representing my people as the first black video on MTV." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the start}} of {{training}} camp Tortorella promised to make changes {{to the way the}} Canucks played. He wanted to make the team tougher to play against. Some of the techniques he felt would accomplish this were hard forechecking, protecting the puck, being strong along the boards, and increasing shot blocking. The Canucks finished the 2012–13 season as the 27th ranked team in blocked shots while the Rangers finished sixth. Tortorella also said that he would use the Sedin twins to kill penalties. The Sedins had asked Vigneault to be used on the penalty kill, but he opted to keep them rested for their offensive role instead. Upon learning that they would be killing penalties Henrik Sedin said: [...] "It's something that I think {{is a big part of}} becoming a great player. You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ice for all situations. For us, we were counted upon to score goals, and if we didn't, then we were terrible. I think you grow as players when you play all situations." [...] Tortorella put the Canucks through a physically demanding training camp. Players were asked to run two miles in 12 minutes and were put through a series of intense skating drills. Tortorella believed he could learn about his players when they were exhausted and asked them to give a little more.|$|E

In 1983 and 1988, {{the games were}} split between Saturday and Monday because Sunday was Christmas, and the NFL had avoided playing on that day at the time. In 1984, both games were played in the Pacific Time Zone, so they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played <b>on</b> Saturday and Sunday to accommodate for time differences. In 1985, both the New York Giants and Jets hosted wild-card games. As they have shared a home stadium since 1984, the games <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> played <b>on</b> different days.|$|R

6000|$|At any rate, enrolment, {{in time of}} peace, cannot fall on many: {{three or}} four {{recruits}} in the year, to replace vacancies, will carry the Canton through its crisis. For we are to note withal, the third part of every regiment can, and should by rule, consist of [...] "foreigners,"--men not born Prussians. These are generally men levied in the Imperial Free-towns; [...] "in the REICH" [...] or Empire, as they term it; that is to say, or is mainly to say, in the countries of Germany that are not Austrian or Prussian. For this foreign third-part too, the recruits must be got; excuses not admissible for Captain or Colonel; nothing but recruits of the due inches will do. Captain and Colonel (supporting their enterprise on frugal adequate [...] "perquisites," [...] hinted of above) <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> outlook; vigilantly, eagerly; and must contrive to get them. Nay, we can take supernumerary recruits; and have in fact always on hand, attached to each regiment, a stock of such.

60|$|It will be {{seen that}} each {{division}} is as strong as three cavalry regiments; it is composed entirely of drivers collected hastily from all parts, Egyptians, Arabs, Italians, Greeks, Hindoos, &c.—all men without the smallest conception of military discipline; and to manage this vast body of men and animals there are a captain and two officers, and eleven white noncommissioned officers. Were each division stationary, or did it move in a body together, the task would be comparatively easy; but it is scattered over the pass, in convoys of from 200 down to little parties of twos and fours, with officers’ baggage. The rules which have been drawn up for the regulation of the corps are admirable on paper, but utterly impracticable on service. Each native soldier {{is supposed to have}} control over twelve drivers and twenty-five mules, and is himself amenable to a head muccadum, or fourth inspector, he to a third, the third to the second, &c. “Each man in charge of a squad is to see that every animal brought in from duty is groomed, has the feet picked and cleaned, the provender put before him, the back well sponged with hot water.” “The saddles will invariably, when taken off the animals, be placed upside down to dry, pads towards the sun, and afterwards neatly piled up with the equipments affixed to each, in rear of each squad, dressing from the right of the line.” All these, and many similar rules, are admirable in theory; utterly impracticable in the field. A convoy arrives late at night. Its first task is to unload, and then to place food before the animals, and to water them if water is attainable; then drivers and animals lie down alike exhausted, and grooming, picking feet, and arranging equipments, dressing from the right, are alike unheeded. The officers of this corps have an almost impossible amount of work to get through. They are supposed to see their animals watered, to parade those which have to start, to see them fed, to see them groomed, to examine their backs, to see that the numerous convoys start at the right time, to look after the polyglot variety of drivers, most of them speaking Arabic, and other unknown tongues. Then they have to look after the native soldiers, to send in reports innumerable, and to keep office-books; they have to perform quartermaster duties and paymaster duties; they have the pay-sheets, family-payment rolls, returns of stores, equipments, defaulter-sheets, &c. to make out with their own hands, unless they take one of the few European inspectors from his work to act as clerk. “They are further responsible for the good order and condition of the cattle, and the due preservation and completeness of their equipments, and must see that each individual soldier, noncommissioned officer and inspector, does his work.” In addition to all this, at present they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> pier, seeing the animals landed, and to inspect the putting together and fittings of the saddles and equipments, and the issue of warm clothing to the drivers.|$|E

(An offensive player does not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team that gets possession first to be considered a starter, nor does a defensive player <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> team that does not; the first play from scrimmage after the first change of possession counts as well.) The third platoon, special teams, in modern times is composed mostly of backup and reserve players from the offensive or defensive platoons, {{with the exception of the}} placekicker or punter; the players who, for instance, take part in the opening kickoff are typically not considered starters.|$|E
