The Encyclopedia Britannica describes it as [...] "one of the most exquisite strains of pious resignation ever written." [...] The opening phrase, [...] "Was Gott tut, das ist wohlgetan", is a variant of [...] "Alles, was er tut, das ist recht," [...] Luther's German version of [...] "all <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> just" [...] from [...] The theme of the hymn is pious trust in God's will in times of adversity and tribulation: as [...] Unger writes, [...] "True piety is to renounce self and submit in quiet faith to God's providential acts despite suffering and poverty." [...] In the 1690 Nürnbergische Gesangbuch the hymn is listed under Klag- und Creuz- Lieder (hymns of mourning and the Cross).|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{explained}} that the Torah records Balaam’s story to make known that because the nonbeliever prophet Balaam did what he did, God removed prophecy and the Holy Spirit from nonbelievers. The Midrash taught that God originally wished to deprive nonbelievers {{of the opportunity to}} argue that God had estranged them. So in an application of the principle of [...] “The Rock, His work is perfect; for all <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> Justice,” God raised up kings, sages, and prophets for both Israel and nonbelievers alike. Just as God raised up Moses for Israel, God raised up Balaam for the nonbelievers. But whereas the prophets of Israel cautioned Israel against transgressions, as in [...] Balaam sought to breach the moral order by encouraging the sin of Baal-Peor in [...] And while the prophets of Israel retained compassion towards both Israel and nonbelievers alike, as reflected in [...] and [...] Balaam sought to uproot the whole nation of Israel for no crime. Thus God removed prophecy from nonbelievers.|$|E

60|$|It was enough. Those who {{understood}} Okematan and <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>were</b> {{well aware that}} he thought La Certe uncommonly sly.|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, they might, Allan," [...] {{he replied}} without anger, {{for all his}} {{troubles}} had induced a reasonable frame of mind in him--for a while. [...] "Yet, <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> past finding out, are they not?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You forget; you {{are talking}} of my brother, my own mother's son. I will hear no harm of Adrian; <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> {{different}} to ours, but he is good-hearted at bottom. Do you understand me, Martin?" ...|$|E

60|$|The footman {{was to the}} Grosvenor Square footmen, {{what the}} house was to the Grosvenor Square houses. Admirable in <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> a back and a bye <b>way.</b> <b>His</b> gorgeousness <b>was</b> not unmixed with dirt; and both in {{complexion}} and consistency he had suffered from the closeness of his pantry. A sallow flabbiness was upon him {{when he took the}} stopper out, and presented the bottle to Mr Clennam's nose.|$|R

6000|$|... "I doubt it. Most {{likely he}} talked Brown into signing {{it just as}} he talked us. I tell you <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> all crooked, like his ideas. Did you hear how he lied about Miss Lindsay?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He has {{suffered}} it," [...] the rabbi said, [...] "and <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> not {{the ways of}} man. It may be that He {{has suffered}} such madness to fall upon, us in order that His name may, at last, be glorified." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "His way! <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> every way, I take it. I {{wanted him}} to come and dine, {{but he seemed to}} think it {{improper}} to eat two dinners in the same house two days running. Isn't that his theory, Miss Dale?" ...|$|E

60|$|Top {{and bottom}} of it is, I regretted my girovago, though I knew it was no good {{thinking}} of him. <b>His</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> not my <b>way.</b> Yet I regretted him, I did.|$|R
6000|$|... "And what harm in that?" [...] I demanded, driven {{against my}} will to take {{the part of the}} fisherman. [...] "Have I not wine-guzzled a-plenty and passed strange nights in all the provinces?

6000|$|Felix {{advanced}} as {{he spoke}} to the pile, and struck a match before the eyes of all the islanders.

He has brought fire from the sun! <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> wonderful!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Tarzan," [...] he continued, [...] "is not an ape. He is {{not like}} his people. <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> not their ways, and so Tarzan {{is going back to}} the lair of his own kind by the waters of the great lake which has no farther shore. You must choose another to rule you, for Tarzan will not return." ...|$|E

6000|$|... 3. The <b>ways</b> of God <b>are</b> unsearchable, the Methods of his Providence are {{secret and}} powerfull; <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>is</b> in the Whirle-wind, {{and in the}} Storm, tis {{invisible}} and iresistible, invisible as the Wind, and iresistible as the Storm.|$|R

6000|$|... "Now {{the serpent}} was more subtil." [...] More subtil.

6000|$|And such is Victory, {{and such}} is Man!

6000|$|... 11.

6000|$|More likely, {{they are}} {{what are called}} odd characters; but for that, are no more original, than what is called an odd genius, in <b>his</b> <b>way,</b> <b>is.</b> But, if original, whence came they? Or where did the novelist pick them up? ...|$|R
60|$|Thady {{did not get}} up at all; in fact, he did {{not know}} what to do or to say. He had been waiting anxiously, hoping that Father Cullen would go, and now the {{difficulties}} in <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>were</b> more than doubled.|$|R
60|$|That moment, the watcher cried from Heaven, {{and sense}} and {{strength}} fled from the mighty Nebuchadnezzar. He was driven from men, and lived seven years among the beasts of the field, till for one year, reason was mercifully restored to him, {{and he made}} {{the best use of}} it in publishing to all the world the story of his pride and of his fall, and with all his heart honouring the King of Heaven, whose works are truth, and <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> judgment.|$|E
6000|$|... 'My son,' {{said the}} old gentleman, 'I will be very frank with you on matters within my competence; on those of which I know nothing {{it does not require}} much {{discretion}} to be silent. I will not fence with you, I take your meaning perfectly; and what can I say, but that we are all in God's hands, and that <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> not as our ways? I have even advised with my superiors in the church, but they, too, were dumb. It is a great mystery.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{think it}} is. He hasn't {{a trace of}} foreign accent and <b>his</b> <b>ways</b> <b>are</b> ours, but I can't help feeling {{that he does not}} belong to us. Then I've noticed that he never talks to Mother much. But of course it's only {{changing}} his name that matters, not where he was born. Our enemies are not all treacherous and cruel. You have seen the portraits Mother has of her own people, and three or four were soldiers. They have kind, true faces. I think they were men with an unusual sense of duty." ...|$|E
60|$|And {{still they}} could not bring {{themselves}} to like him. They did not know him. <b>His</b> <b>ways</b> <b>were</b> not theirs. He gave no confidences. He repelled all probing. Youth that he was, they could never nerve themselves to dare to question him.|$|R
60|$|Forces {{regardless}} of family or class or custom were beating down his guard; impending events over {{which he had}} no control threw their shadows on his head. The irritation of one accustomed to have <b>his</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> roused against he knew not what.|$|R
60|$|<b>His</b> <b>way</b> <b>was</b> now easy. He drew {{himself out}} of the water by the ropes, and ascended the ladder; then crawled along outside the bulwark until he came to a porthole, from which a gun projected; then he crawled in there, and lay under the cannon.|$|R
