Numerous failures of drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> have occurred in recent years. The components are not meeting their required design lives leaving mill owners concerned about the expensive repair costs and lost profits associated with the mill downtime during repairs. There {{is a need to}} research the design methodology of the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills</b> and the analysis of fatigue failures in mills and similar equipment e. g. kilns in order to develop a comprehensive and improved picture of how to design and operate these mills. As with numerous other engineered items, the critical issue is that a thorough understanding of the type, magnitude, direction, and duration of all loads that the components will experience while in operation is required in order to design them correctly. A literature survey was performed to research advanced design methods and identify sources of loading data for <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Many interesting references were identified but no specific examples were found where strain gauge measurements were used to quantify the loads experienced by the drivetrain components of <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> Strain gauge measurements were conducted on the drivetrains of 30 <b>grinding</b> <b>mills.</b> The measured data was processed and analysed to determine the key operating loads experienced by the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> drivetrain components.

Finally, comprehensive fatigue analysis was conducted using the measured data to understand the major contributors to poor service life of the drivetrain components.

40|$|Abstract: In most {{manufacturing}} processes, {{objects of}} the required shape and size are produced through plastic deformation; sometimes by deforming the product itself through rolling, extrusion, drawing etc, and by deforming the metal removed through <b>grinding,</b> <b>milling</b> and cutting operation. In these processes, a load of appreciable magnitude is applied on the material subjected to deformation, and the plastic flow thus produced is suitably restricted to get the desired shape and size. Equal Channel Angular Pressing (ECAP) is very capable of producing ultrafine grained microstructures and improves the mechanical properties of the deformed materials. The variations in strain path directions during deformation have significantly effect on the physical and mechanical response of distorted metals...|$|E
40|$|Three {{types of}} mills and six milling methods were {{employed}} to mill two waxy rice varieties (TCSW 1, long grain; TCW 70, short grain), and the physicochemical and functional properties of rice flour were examined.

Wet-milling slightly increased solubility as test temperatures increased, and significantly increased swelling power at 75 and 85 degrees C for TCSW 1 and TCW 70, respectively. Hammer and semi-dry hammer milling gave higher percentages of coarse particles (100 - 300 mu m); cyclone and turbo milling led to a more even particle-size distribution, and the wet-milling gave the finest particles (10 - 30 mu m) Dry hammer-milled rice had higher gelatinization and pasting temperatures, and semi-dry <b>grinding</b> <b>milling</b> resulted in the lowest pasting temperature, setback viscosity, and enthalpy value among the mills.

40|$|Abstract: This article {{presents}} {{a review of}} solid lubricants application in different machining processes such as <b>grinding,</b> <b>milling,</b> drilling, and turning. Of late, several reasons {{have led to the}} increased usage of solid lubricants in machining. The heat generated in the cutting zone dur-ing machining is critical in deciding the workpiece quality. Although cutting fluids are widely employed to carry away the heat in machining, their usage poses threat to ecology and the health of workers. Hence, there arises a need to identify eco-friendly and user-friendly alternatives to conventional cutting fluids. Modern tribology has facilitated the use of solid lubricants as an alter-native to cutting fluids in machining. Graphite, calcium fluoride, molybdenum disulphide, and boric acid are the general solid lubricants used in machining. Process performance is improved with the application of solid lubricants in machining. By reducing coefficient of friction, cutting forces and tool wear are reduced in machining with solid lubricants. Reduction in cutting forces results in lower specific energy requirement and thus reduces production cost. Surface quality of the machined workpiece is also improved with solid lubricants...|$|E

40|$|Hybrid micro {{machine tools}} are {{increasingly}} {{in demand for}} manufacturing microproducts made of hard-to-machine materials, such as ceramic air bearing, bio-implants and power electronics substrates etc. These machines can realize hybrid machining processes which combine one or two non-conventional machining techniques such as EDM, ECM, laser machining, etc. and conventional machining techniques such as turning, <b>grinding,</b> <b>milling</b> on one machine bed. Hybrid machine tool developers tend to mix and match components from multiple vendors for the best value and performance.

The architecture uses finite state machine (FSM) for hardware control and data flow.

40|$|This {{paper is}} an effort to utilize {{abundant}} availability of natural fibres and waste plastics for the development of composite materials based on polymer and particles of natural fibres for conservation of natural resources such as forests. Ensete false banana (EFB) fibres were used as reinforcement to obtain composites with melted waste polyethylene bottled as matrix phase. The composites were prepared by means of compression moulding, and then the effects of fibres loading on mechanical properties such as impact strength, flexural strength, and wear resistance were investigated. Water uptake was also studied. It was observed that the flexural modulus, compressive strength and flexural strength of treated EBF reinforced PE increased linearly with increment of fibres loadings. This trend was similar for impact strength where it exhibited a slight reduction at the initial stage but increased later as the fibres loading increased. It was also observed the water absorption increased with increase in fibres loading. Machining operations such as <b>grinding,</b> <b>milling,</b> drilling and cutting can be performed on the composite.

40|$|A <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit forms {{a crucial}} part in the {{energy-intensive}} comminution process of extracting valuable metals and minerals from mined ore. The ability to control the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is of primary importance to achieve the desired product specification with regards to quality and production rate. In order to achieve control objectives an accurate dynamic model of the milling circuit is required. Phenomenological models are preferred over linear-time-invariant models since the latter cannot describe the non-linear behaviour of the process. However, the available phenomenological models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits are usually complex, use large parameter sets and are mostly aimed towards steady-state design of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits. This study investigates simplified non-linear dynamic models of <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuits suitable for process controller design. In {{the first part of}} this study, the number of size classes in a cumulative rates model of a <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit is reduced to determine the minimum number required to provide a reasonably accurate model of the circuit for process control. Each reduced size class set is used to create a non-linear cumulative rates model which is linearized to design a linear model predictive controller. The accuracy of a model is determined by the ability of the corresponding model predictive controller to control important process variables in the <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit as represented by the full non-linear cumulative rates model. The second part of the study validates a simple and novel non-linear model of a run-of-mine <b>grinding</b> <b>mill</b> circuit developed for process control and estimation purposes. This model is named the Hulbert-model and makes use of the minimum number of states and parameters necessary to produce responses that are qualitatively accurate. It consists of separate feeder, mill, sump and hydrocyclone modules that can be connected to model different circuit configurations. The model uses five states: rocks, solids, fines, water and steel balls. Rocks are defined as too large to be discharged from the mill, whereas solids, defined as particles small enough to leave the mill, consist of out-of-specification coarse ore and in-specification fine ore fractions. The model incorporates a unique prediction of the rheology of the slurry within the mill. A new hydrocyclone model is also presented. The Hulbert-model parameters are fitted to an existing plant’s sampling campaign data and a step-wise procedure is given to fit the model to steady-state data. Simulation test results of the model are compared to sampling campaign data of the same plant at different steady-state conditions. Dissertation (MEng) [...] University of Pretoria, 2012.
