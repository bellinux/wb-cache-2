5|$|The Fountainhead is a 1943 {{novel by}} Russian-American author Ayn Rand, her first major {{literary}} success. The novel's protagonist, Howard Roark, is an individualistic young architect who designs modernist buildings {{and refuses to}} compromise with an architectural establishment unwilling to accept innovation. Roark embodies what Rand {{believed to be the}} ideal man, and <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> reflects Rand's belief that individualism is superior to collectivism.|$|E
5|$|The {{authority}} of the Byzantine emperor as the legitimate Roman emperor was challenged by the coronation of Charlemagne as Imperator Augustus by Pope Leo III in the year 800. Needing Charlemagne's support in <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> against his enemies in Rome, Leo used {{the lack of a}} male occupant of the throne of the Roman Empire at the time to claim that it was vacant and that he could therefore crown a new Emperor himself.|$|E
5|$|A strong {{relationship}} existed between Zahir and the Shia Muslim peasants of Jabal Amil and their sheikhs. Zahir maintained {{law and order}} in Jabal Amil, while leaving its mostly Shia inhabitants to their own devices. The Shia also benefited economically from Zahir's monopoly of the cotton industry and their sheikhs provided him men of great military skill to support <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> against the Ottoman authorities. Zahir was a key backer of the Shia in their war with the Druze Jumblatt clan and the Shihab dynasty under Mulhim Shihab, and likewise, Shia forces were critical to the defense of Zahir's sheikhdom against expeditions by the Ottoman governor of Damascus in 1771 and 1772.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{explained}} {{that although the}} title of his documentary was Fuck, he allowed alternate designations using an asterisk. The film and content he controlled would refer to the title as Fuck, including theatrical and DVD editions. He concluded that <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> reflected the debate alluded to by the documentary, and this realization motivated him to stand firm on the film's title. Because the film is about how a taboo word can impact culture, it was important to keep Fuck as its title.|$|E
5|$|Jinnah was {{the central}} figure of the 1998 film Jinnah, {{which was based on}} Jinnah's life and <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> for the {{creation}} of Pakistan. Christopher Lee, who portrayed Jinnah, called his performance the best of his career. The 1954 Hector Bolitho's book Jinnah: Creator of Pakistan prompted Fatima Jinnah to release a book, titled My Brother (1987), as she thought that Bolitho's book had failed to express the political aspects of Jinnah. The book received positive reception in Pakistan. Jinnah of Pakistan (1984) by Stanley Wolpert is {{regarded as one of the}} best biographical books on Jinnah.|$|E

During <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> with the Mangalores he kills their leader. Meanwhile, Zorg arrives, shooting and seriously wounding Leeloo {{before taking a}} carrying case that he presumes contains the stones back to his spacecraft, leaving behind a time bomb that forces the liner's occupants to evacuate. Discovering the case to be empty, Zorg returns to the ship and deactivates his bomb, but a dying Mangalore sets off his own device, destroying the ship and killing Zorg. Dallas, Cornelius, Leeloo, and talk-show host Ruby Rhod escape with the stones aboard Zorg's spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|The {{court records}} of the Nguyễn dynasty in Huế, the Đại Nam thực lục (Veritable Records of the Great South) dispute the French claims, {{revealing}} that the court attempted to prevent illegal guerrilla activity {{by the likes of}} Định. However, in one edict, Định claimed that Tự Đức endorsed <b>his</b> <b>struggle,</b> in an attempt to garner popular support. This fuelled French claims that the guerrillas were periodically traveling between French territory and the adjoining sovereign Nguyễn territory to get supplies from provincial officials.|$|E
5|$|After {{appearing}} in a November 2006 friendly match against Greece, Diarra was {{absent from the}} national team for nearly two years, partly due to <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> for playing time in Lyon. As a result, he missed UEFA Euro 2008, although he {{was named to the}} competition's preliminary squad. After regaining his form at Bordeaux, Diarra began making his way back into the team and participated in seven 2010 FIFA World Cup qualifying matches. He was later selected to participate in his second consecutive FIFA World Cup. France endured a disastrous campaign as the players went on strike in response to its disagreement over the expulsion of striker Nicolas Anelka from the team. In the team's final group stage match against hosts South Africa, with several veteran players missing from the squad, Diarra was rewarded with the captaincy {{for the first time in}} his international career and led the team to a 2–1 loss, which resulted in its elimination from the competition.|$|E

5|$|After {{the death}} of Ivan Alexander in 1371 Ivan Sratsimir broke off ties with Tarnovo and even placed the {{archbishop}} of Vidin {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Patriarchate of Constantinople to demonstrate his independence. Due to its geographical position, Vidin was initially safe from attacks by the Ottoman Turks who were ravaging the Balkans to the south and Ivan Sratsimir made no attempts to assist Ivan Shishman in <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> against the Ottomans. Only after the fall of Tarnovo in 1393 did his policy become more active and he eventually joined the crusade of the Hungarian king Sigismund. However, after the disastrous battle of Nicopolis in 1396, the Ottomans marched to Vidin and seized it. Ivan Sratsimir was captured and imprisoned in Bursa where he was probably strangled. Although his son Constantine II claimed the title Emperor of Bulgaria and at times controlled some parts of his father's realm, Ivan Sratsimir is generally regarded by historians as the last ruler of medieval Bulgaria.|$|E
5|$|Haakon also {{attempted}} to strengthen his {{ties with the}} papacy by issuing a vow of crusade. In 1241 he however converted this into a vow of engaging in warfare against pagan peoples in the north {{in light of the}} Mongol invasion of Europe. When a group of Karelians ("Bjarmians") had been forced westwards by the Mongols, Haakon allowed them to stay in Malangen and had them Christianized—something that would please the papacy. Later, in 1248, Louis IX of France proposed (by Matthew Paris as messenger) to Haakon to join him for a crusade, with Haakon as commander of the fleet, but Haakon turned the offer down. While Haakon had been unsuccessful in gaining the recognition of Pope Gregory IX, he quickly gained the support from Pope Innocent IV who sought alliances in <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> with Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II. Haakon finally achieved royal recognition by Pope Innocent in 1246, and Cardinal William of Sabina was sent to Bergen and crowned Haakon in 1247.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, Zayat Stables' horses Bodemeister {{and then}} Paynter ran second {{in each of}} the three legs of the Triple Crown. Bodemeister {{finished}} a narrow second place in both the Kentucky Derby and Preakness Stakes to I'll Have Another. Switching horses in the 2012 Belmont Stakes, Zayat's colt Paynter also finished second. Paynter went on to win the Grade I Haskell Invitational but shortly thereafter developed near-fatal complications from colitis and laminitis. Zayat authorized the highest quality of care for the horse, and following abdominal surgery and several months of rehabilitation, Paynter successfully returned to racing in 2013. After Zayat and his son Justin began making regular social media updates on Twitter with the hashtag #PowerUpPaynter, the horse developed a significant fan base, and received hundreds of get well cards, many from children. For <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> to return to health, Paynter won NTRA Moment of the Year Award and Secretariat Vox Populi Award.|$|E

5|$|Kurt Elizabeth Hummel is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{and one of}} the male leads in the Fox musical comedy-drama series Glee. Series creators Ryan Murphy, Brad Falchuk and Ian Brennan initially conceived of him as a fashionable gay countertenor who is routinely bullied at school. Kurt is portrayed by actor Chris Colfer, and has appeared as a character on the show since its pilot episode, first broadcast on May 19, 2009. Glee follows the trials of the New Directions glee club at the fictional William McKinley High School in the town of Lima, Ohio, of which Kurt is a member. His storylines in the first season focus on <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> with his sexual identity as he discloses his homosexuality to his father and friends, and deals with his romantic feelings for Finn Hudson, the heterosexual co-captain of the glee club.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about his childhood. Around 1549-1550 he briefly visited Italy and likely spent a few months {{attending}} lectures at the Padua University. Upon his return, he joined the army of Ferdinand I, Holy Roman Emperor, and took part in his military struggle against the Turks. Some time after 1553 Báthory was captured by the Turks, and after Ferdinand I refused to pay his ransom, Báthory joined the opposing side, supporting John II Sigismund Zápolya in <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> for power in the Eastern Hungarian Kingdom. As Zápolya's supporter, Báthory acted both as a feudal lord, military commander and a diplomat. During one of his trips to Vienna he was put under house arrest for two years. During this time Báthory fell out of favour at Zápolya's court, and his position was largely assumed by another Hungarian noble, Gáspár Bekes. Báthory briefly retired from politics, but he still wielded considerable influence and {{was seen as a}} possible successor to Zápolya.|$|E
5|$|Livingstone and the leftists became {{embroiled in}} {{factional}} in-fighting within Labour, vying for powerful positions with centrist members. Although never adopting Marxism, Livingstone {{became involved with}} a number of Trotskyist groups active within Labour; viewing them as potential allies, he became friends with Chris Knight, Graham Bash and Keith Veness, members of the Socialist Charter, a Trotskyist cell affiliated with the Revolutionary Communist League that had infiltrated the Labour party. In <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> against Labour centrists, Livingstone was influenced by Trotskyist Ted Knight, who convinced him to oppose the use of British troops in Northern Ireland, believing they would simply be used to quash nationalist protests against British rule. Livingstone stood as the leftist candidate for the Chair of the Lambeth Housing Committee in April 1973, but was defeated by David Stimpson, who undid many of Livingston and Carr's reforms.|$|E

5|$|On Queen Elizabeth's {{accession}} in November 1558 Dudley {{was appointed}} Master of the Ordnance, in which capacity {{he was to}} unofficially assist William the Silent in <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> against Spain by delivering English weaponry. As the senior member of his family, Dudley was created Earl of Warwick in December 1561. In 15621563 he commanded the army Elizabeth sent to Le Havre to garrison the town and assist the Huguenots in the First French War of Religion. This campaign ended in failure when the French belligerents agreed on a peace and the English surrendered because of the plague which was decimating their ranks. Dudley, who had acted honorably throughout, returned with a severe leg wound which was to hinder his further career and ultimately led to his death 27 years later. His last military engagement was against the Northern rebels in 1569. From 1573 {{he served as a}} privy councillor.|$|E
5|$|The Gathering Storm follows many plot threads but {{focuses on}} two characters, Rand al'Thor and Egwene al'Vere. While it follows al'Thor's {{attempts}} to unite and rally the world's forces for the Last Battle, it also addresses <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> with his sanity, {{caused by the}} corruption of his mind {{from the use of}} the male half of the One Power. The unification of the White Tower, the headquarters of the female users of the One Power known as Aes Sedai, is addressed from al'Vere's perspective, as well as the exposure of the Black Ajah, a secretive and opposing faction within the story. While the stories of other main characters such as Perrin Aybara and Mat Cauthon are briefly touched upon, they have little bearing on the main plot line. Some main characters such as Elayne Trakand and Lan Mandragoran do not appear at all, but are referred to.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sinuhe, {{written in}} Middle Egyptian, {{might be the}} classic of Egyptian literature. Also written at this time was the Westcar Papyrus, a set of stories told to Khufu by his sons {{relating}} the marvels performed by priests. The Instruction of Amenemope is considered a masterpiece of near-eastern literature. Towards {{the end of the}} New Kingdom, the vernacular language was more often employed to write popular pieces like the Story of Wenamun and the Instruction of Any. The former {{tells the story of a}} noble who is robbed on his way to buy cedar from Lebanon and of <b>his</b> <b>struggle</b> to return to Egypt. From about 700BC, narrative stories and instructions, such as the popular Instructions of Onchsheshonqy, as well as personal and business documents were written in the demotic script and phase of Egyptian. Many stories written in demotic during the Greco-Roman period were set in previous historical eras, when Egypt was an independent nation ruled by great pharaohs such as Ramesses II.|$|E
