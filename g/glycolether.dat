40|$|The {{preparation}} of spinnable sols {{has been developed}} to obtain {{a new type of}} sol-gel derived pure aluminia fiber. The starting material was aluminium sec-butoxide, which was modified in a first step with <b>glycolether,</b> e. g., isopropoxyethanol. This leads to apartial replacement of alkoxy groups via alcoholysis an a change of the precursor structure from a trimetric to a terametric one. In the second step, carboxylation, the transformation to six-coordinated aluminium could be observed. Due to the formation of a sol with Newtonian flow behaviour after hydrolysis, gel fibers up to several kilometers long could be drawn directly from the clear colorless sol with spinning velocities up to 200 m/min. The addition of an organic filament-forming polymer is not necessary. The sol is spinnable for periods up to one year. The transformation of gel fiber to a-Al 2 O 3 occurs at 1150 deg C...|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the effect of early {{shrinkage}} is important to prevent aesthetic defects and, especially, to avoid the reduction of durability of concrete elements due to surface cracking. This paper presents the application of a new digital imaging methodology to quantify the effects of polypropylene macrofibres, microfibres and <b>glycolether</b> shrinkage reducing admixture (SRA) on early shrinkage cracking. This way, the effectiveness of different admixtures incorporated into the common base mix design of concrete can be compared impartially through the total cracking area, maximum crack width, total crack length, among other parameters that this methodology provides. The results demonstrate the great capacity of the methodology to isolate and determine the characteristics of an entire cracking pattern, and the similarity of behaviour between admixtures. Nevertheless, the presence of 1 kg/m 3 of microfibres leads to the delay and the decrease of early shrinkage cracking pattern. Postprint (published version...|$|E
40|$|Althougln {{start-up}} and shutdown only {{account for}} {{a small percentage of}} the total operating time of an industrial chemical plant, still up to 4 6 % of the accidents occur during the start-up or shutdown. Furthermore, a large part of the costs of a start-up account for the extra personnel that is needed on site. Therefore, it is logical to optimise both start-up time and safety. For this optimisation, dynamic models that simulate start-up behaviour are needed. The basis for this graduation assignment is a dynamic model of a <b>glycolether</b> process that has been developed in the equation-oriented simulation environment gPROMS. This process has a typical process layout, which consists of a reaction and recovery section with recycle. The recycle is used for heat integration with the feed. During start-up the system must be heated, because the reaction can only start at a high temperature. In this work the reboiler provides the heat and through the recycle the reactor is heated, making the use of a start-up heater unnecessary. Starting up the system in an integrated way and the presence of discontinuities provide a numerically challenging problem. Discontinuities are present, because the distillation column model incorporates equations for liquid weeping and vapour flowing through a downcomer; flows that are typically present during the first phase of a start-up. General guidelines for start-up were used to generate a basic start-up procedure, which is used for comparison with the optimised procedure. The optimisation objectives are a minimisation of start-up time and a maximisation of safety during start-up of the integrated process. Safety includes a maximum breakthrough of reactants to the separation section, a maximum temperature in the reactor and a maximum temperature change everywhere in the process. A Pareto curve is used to visualise the trade-off between these objectives. Optimisation strategies for the reactor comprise choosing the optimal feed temperature (and thereby the optimal recycle temperature), choosing the optimal moment and quantity of reactant and catalyst addition and choosing the moment that the cooling water is started. Strategies for the distillation column involve establishing an optimal reboiler duty strategy and choosing the initial amount and composition of material in the reboiler and condenser. It has been found that ramping PO feed as well as the cooling water flow have a large influence on the safety objective. It has also been found that the total feed flow should be low for safety and for start-up time, because a large excess of MeOH absorbs so much heat from the process that the reaction can not start-up gradually. The temperature of the feed should be high to minimise start-up time, but low for a maximisation of safety. The Pareto curve obtained from the optimisations in gPROMS shows a trade-off between the objectives time and safety. It also shows that not much extra safety is gained if the start-up time is extended very long. However, which operating point on the curve is preferred depends on specific preferences.

40|$|During {{automotive}} painting, {{volatile organic}} compounds (VOCs) associated with the paint solvents are emitted to the atmosphere. Most VOC emissions come from spraying operations via the use of solvent-based paints, as the spraybooth air picks up gaseous solvent compounds and overspray paint materials. The VOCs consist of aromatic and aliphatic hydrocarbons, ketones, esters, alcohols, and <b>glycolethers.</b> Most VOCs (some hydrophilic VOCs are captured and retained in the water.) are captured by an adsorption system and thermally oxidized. In this paper, the processes involved in automotive painting and in VOC control are reviewed. The topics include: painting operations (briefly), the nature of VOCs, VOC-control processes (adsorption, absorption, biological removal, and thermal oxidation) and energy recovery from VOCs using a fuel reformer and a fuel cell, and the beneficial use of paint sludge...|$|R
40|$|Competing in {{a global}} market place forces {{chemical}} industry to be flexible and cost-effective in production. To optimize production the processes are modeled before they are built. Normally these models show the steady-state behavior. This, however, will be insufficient to show {{the flexibility of the}} process and guarantee safety and environmental constraints are met under all circumstances. Dynamic models are useful to give extra insight in the operability, flexibility and profitability of a process. The goals of this project are to build a model that will describe startup and shutdown behavior of a process and perform a simplified optimization of a specific startup procedure. For these goals a model has been constructed in gPROMS, which gives a representation of the dynamic behavior of a <b>glycolether</b> process. This process consists of a reactor, distillation column and recycle. The model consists of over 15 000 equations, which include the physical properties of the system. Further features of the model are the use of an equilibrium tray model, inclusion of liquid flows over the weir and dumping through the holes, inclusion of vapor flows through the holes and through the downcomer, addition and purge of inert, and a dynamic, single phase, plug-flow reactor of the shell-and-tube-type operating under turbulent flow conditions. All trends in the profiles of the model and ASPEN follow each other nicely and the steady state is estimated to be 5 - 10 % accurate compared to ASPEN. The model is capable of describing a shutdown, as long as vapor escapes through the downcomer from the reboiler. It is also capable of describing a startup in which the column is heated, inerts are purged, the reactor is heated and the steady-state is reached. All this is done without an external heat source, using only the heat generated by the reboiler. The results have not been verified experimentally. Several errors were made in modeling the process, such as an incorrect excess of MeOH in the reactor, incorrect surface areas for heat loss on the tray and in the reboiler, small reset rates for controllers in the condenser, large setpoint changes and high rates of temperature rise in the system. Their influences, however, are small, or can be corrected with longer calculation times. Drawbacks of the model are the long calculation times (2. 5 hours) and numerical instabilities. Also, the model developed is not completely generic, but could be adapted for other systems. During a simplified optimization by factorial design of the startup-schedule used, only four optimization steps were needed to reduce the loss at the end-point by 28 %, while only considering three variables. Though the absolute gain is only Hfl. 781, this demonstrates that optimization can lead to significant increases in profitability. Overall the model provides valuable insight in the processes that take place during dynamic operation of an interconnected reactor and distillation system.
