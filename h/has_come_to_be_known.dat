5|$|A major {{development}} {{in recent decades}} has been {{the study of the}} formation, structure, and evolution of scientific communities by sociologists and anthropologists - including David Bloor, Harry Collins, Bruno Latour, and Anselm Strauss. Concepts and methods (such as rational choice, social choice or game theory) from economics have also been applied for understanding the efficiency of scientific communities in the production of knowledge. This interdisciplinary field <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as science and technology studies.|$|E

5|$|In {{anticipation}} of {{the approval of the}} new five-cent coin, the Mint's chief engraver, James B. Longacre, had begun preparing designs and pattern coins in 1865. After rejecting pieces showing deceased presidents George Washington and Abraham Lincoln, Treasury Secretary Hugh McCulloch decided on a design similar to Longacre's two-cent piece, with a shield on the obverse and a numeral 5 surrounded by stars and rays on the reverse. This <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Shield nickel.|$|E
5|$|Congress {{began the}} task of {{restoring}} federal coins to circulation in 1864 with a two-cent piece in bronze, and by authorizing a three-cent piece in copper-nickel the following year. In 1866, it authorized a five-cent piece in the latter alloy, the nickel, as it <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known.</b> With the three-cent silver effectively replaced by base-metal pieces, it did not share in the increased mintage of silver coins that began in 1868. The three-cent silver was struck {{at the rate of}} a few thousand per year into the 1870s.|$|E
5|$|Douglas's {{influences}} {{were not}} from England alone. Although he never travelled abroad, he incorporated Gothic styles from continental countries, especially Germany and France. This combination of Gothic styles contributed to what <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the High Victorian style. Its features include {{a sense of}} massiveness, steep roofs which are frequently hipped, round turrets with conical roofs, pinnacles, heavy corbel tables, {{and the use of}} polychromism. Many of Douglas's works, especially his earlier ones, are High Victorian in style, or incorporate High Victorian features. One characteristic feature of Douglas's work is the inclusion of dormer windows rising through the eaves and surmounted by hipped roofs.|$|E

5|$|O'Gara's {{last minute}} {{conversion}} against Gloucester on 18 January 2003 helped Munster to a 27-point victory which took them {{through to the}} Heineken Cup quarter final; this match <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> in Munster folklore as the Miracle Match. He {{was part of the}} Munster team that won the 2002–03 Celtic League, starting and scoring 12 points as Munster beat Neath 37–17 in the Millennium Stadium. O'Gara turned down the chance to join NFL side Miami Dolphins in March 2003. He started when Munster beat Llanelli Scarlets to win the Celtic Cup in May 2005, scoring 17 points in the game.|$|E
5|$|Another {{interpretation}} {{was that}} the North Vietnamese were planning to work both ends against the middle. This strategy <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Option Play. If the NVA could take Khe Sanh, {{all well and good}} for them. If they could not, they would occupy the attention of as many American and South Vietnamese forces in I Corps as they could to facilitate the Tet Offensive. This view was supported by a captured (in 1969) North Vietnamese study of the battle. According to it, the NVA would have taken Khe Sanh if they could, but there were limits to the price they were willing to pay. Their main objectives were to inflict casualties on US troops and to isolate them in the remote border regions.|$|E
5|$|For a {{year and}} a half, Polish patriots waited while {{planning}} an insurrection. On March 24, 1794 in Kraków, Tadeusz Kościuszko declared what <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as the Kościuszko Uprising. On May 7, he issued the Proclamation of Połaniec (Uniwersał Połaniecki), granting freedom to the peasants and ownership of land to all who fought in the insurrection. Revolutionary tribunals administered summary justice to those deemed traitors to the Commonwealth. After initial victories at the Battle of Racławice (April 4), the capture of Warsaw (April 18) and the Wilno (April 22)the Uprising was crushed when the forces of Russia, Austria and Prussia joined in a military intervention. Historians consider the Uprising's defeat to have been a foregone conclusion in face of the superiority in numbers and resources of the three invading powers. The defeat of Kościuszko's forces led in 1795 to the third and final partition of the Commonwealth.|$|E

5|$|For galaxies {{more distant}} than the Local Group {{and the nearby}} Virgo Cluster, but within a {{thousand}} megaparsecs or so, the redshift is approximately proportional to the galaxy's distance. This correlation was first observed by Edwin Hubble and <b>has</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> <b>known</b> as Hubble's law. Vesto Slipher {{was the first to}} discover galactic redshifts, in about the year 1912, while Hubble correlated Slipher's measurements with distances he measured by other means to formulate his Law. In the widely accepted cosmological model based on general relativity, redshift is mainly a result of the expansion of space: this means that the farther away a galaxy is from us, the more the space has expanded in the time since the light left that galaxy, so the more the light has been stretched, the more redshifted the light is, and so the faster it appears to be moving away from us. Hubble's law follows in part from the Copernican principle. Because it is usually not known how luminous objects are, measuring the redshift is easier than more direct distance measurements, so redshift is sometimes in practice converted to a crude distance measurement using Hubble's law.|$|E
