5000|$|Initial {{enrollment}} {{into the}} WIHS occurred between October 1994 and November 1995. The total initial enrollment for the WIHS was 2,056 HIV-positive women and 569 HIV-negative women. [...] Since WIHS recruited its initial population, several new trends developed as the HIV epidemic evolved, {{all of which}} argued for {{an expansion of the}} WIHS cohort. First, despite careful follow-up of the cohort, the inevitable course of illness and time had led to [...] and death. Additionally, increased sample sizes were needed because the effectiveness and consequences of Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy (HAART) added new strata to many key analyses, and decreased the incidence of clinical outcomes. And finally, as the original cohort continued to age, it became less able to support studies of risk behaviors, sexually transmitted diseases, and reproductive function. Thus, WIHS funding was augmented in 2001 to empower the study to <b>efficiently</b> <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> meet the study’s specific aims through the recruitment of additional women. Total enrollment in 2001-02 (WIHS visits 15 and 16) was 738 HIV-positive and 403 HIV-negative participants. [...] Beginning in January 2011, the WIHS opened enrollment again, in order to replace those women who had died during WIHS III and WIHS IV. Total enrollment in 2011-12 (WIHS visits 35-37) was 276 HIV-positive and 95 HIV-negative participants. In the summer of 2013, the WIHS will begin enrolling approximately 800 women from the WIHS Southern sites (Atlanta, GA; Chapel Hill, NC; Miami, FL; Birmingham, AL; Jackson, MS). All potential study participants undergo an initial screening to determine study eligibility. If the woman is willing {{to take part in the}} study and gives informed consent, she will participate in an in-depth interview, physical exam, and specimen collection.|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{technique}} for decomposing Cepheid light curves into their fundamental constituent parts; that is, their radius and temperature variations. We demonstrate that any given pair of optical luminosity and color curves {{can be used}} to predict the shape, amplitude and phase of a Cepheid's light variation at any other wavelength. With such predictions in hand, a single new observation at any given new wavelength {{can be used to}} normalize the properties of the predicted light curve, and in specific, derive a precise value of the time-averaged mean. We suggest that this method will be of great advantage in <b>efficiently</b> observing <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> obtaining the mean properties of known Cepheids scheduled to be observed at new wavelengths, specifically in the mid-infrared where JWST will be operating.

The success of future space telescopes with the goal for finding small planets will be based on proper filtering, analysis and detection of transits in perturbed stellar light curves. The wavelet-based filter methods VARLET and PHALET, developed by RIU-PF, in combination with the transit detection software package EXOTRANS allow the extraction of (i) strong stellar variations, (ii) instrument caused spikes and singularities within a stellar light curve, (iii) already detected planetary or stellar binary transits {{in order to be able}} to search for further planets or planets about binary stars.

40|$|Plasmodium falciparum, {{the most}} deadly agent of malaria, {{displays}} {{a wide variety}} of resistance mechanisms in the field. The ability of antimalarial compounds in development to overcome these must therefore be carefully evaluated to ensure uncompromised activity against real-life parasites. We report here on the selection and phenotypic as well as genotypic characterization of a panel of sensitive and multidrug-resistant P. falciparum strains {{that can be used to}} optimally identify and deconvolute the cross-resistance signals from an extended panel of investigational antimalarials. As a case study, the effectiveness of the selected panel of strains was demonstrated using the 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazole series, a newly identified antimalarial series of compounds with in vitro activity against P. falciparum at nanomolar concentrations. This series of compounds was to be found inactive against several multidrug-resistant strains, and the deconvolution of this signal implicated pfcrt, the genetic determinant of chloroquine resistance. Targeted mode-of-action studies further suggested that this new chemical series might act as falcipain 2 inhibitors, substantiating the suggestion that these compounds have a site of action similar to that of chloroquine but a distinct mode of action. New antimalarials must overcome existing resistance and, ideally, prevent its de novo appearance. The panel of strains reported here, which includes recently collected as well as standard laboratory-adapted field isolates, is able to <b>efficiently</b> detect <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> characterize cross-resistance <b>and,</b> as such, can contribute to the faster development of new, effective antimalarial drugs...|$|R
30|$|Treatment {{potential}} for many biomedical conditions {{is limited by}} the lack of therapeutics that can be <b>efficiently</b> targeted <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> controlled. For instance, functional recovery following neurotraumatic injury could be facilitated by therapeutics for guided axon regeneration [1]. Axon growth can be directed by magnetic or electrical fields alone [2 – 4], but a more manipulable system that provides precisely tunable therapeutic delivery may offer enhanced potential to direct axon regeneration and guidance to targets. Nano-structured materials and smart surfaces provide great {{potential for}} developing such novel biomedical therapeutics [5 – 8]. However, several issues limit the use of conventional magnetic nanoparticles for biomedical applications. Magnetic nanoparticles alone are highly toxic, but excipients can facilitate their delivery to cells [9]. Several groups have synthesized magnetic nanoparticle systems using smart polymers like poly (N-isopropylacrylamide) (PNIPAM) [10 – 12]. However, PNIPAM based systems have low biocompatibility because the NIPAM monomer is carcinogenic and teratogenic [13]. Dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA) coated particles enhances intracellular uptake, but the surface functionalization does not improve the biocompatibility of the nanomagnets [14]. Traditional polyethylene glycol (PEG) coating reduces toxicity, but it does not retain thermo-sensitive behavior or external tunability. Thus, development of a highly biocompatible, non-toxic and highly tunable nanoparticle system is necessary. Ideally, the constructed materials should: (1) minimize toxicity, (2) control intracellular functions like temperature or pH, and (3) elicit a fast response to external stimuli (e.g., ac magnetic field). A system that meets these goals possesses enhanced potential for combinatorial therapeutics. For example, simultaneous use of hyperthermia and low doses of chemotherapeutic agents decreases tumor growth by targeted cytotoxicity with reduced systemic effects [15].|$|R
40|$|Recombination of {{wild-type}} and mutant loxP sites {{mediated by}} wild-type Cre protein was analyzed in vivo using a sensitive phage P 1 transduction assay. Contrary to some earlier reports, recombination between loxP sites {{was found to}} be highly specific: a loxP site recombined in vivo only with another of identical sequence, with no crossover recombination either between a wild-type and mutant site; or between two different mutant sites tested. Mutant loxP sites of identical sequence recombined as efficiently as wild-type. The highly specific and efficient recombination of mutant loxP sites in vivo helped in developing a procedure to progressively truncate DNA from either end of large genomic inserts in P 1 -derived artificial chromosomes (PACs) using transposons that carry either a wild-type or mutant loxP sequence. PAC libraries of human DNA were constructed with inserts flanked by a wild-type and one of the two mutant loxP sites, and deletions from both ends generated in clones using newly constructed wild-type and mutant loxP transposons. Analysis of the results provides new insight into the very large co-integrates formed during P 1 transduction of plasmids with loxP sites: a model with tri- and possibly multimeric co-integrates comprising the PAC plasmid, phage DNA, and transposon plasmid(s) as intermediates in the cell appears best to fit the data. The ability to truncate a large piece of DNA from both ends is likely to facilitate functionally mapping gene boundaries more <b>efficiently,</b> <b>and</b> make available <b>precisely</b> trimmed genes in their chromosomal contexts for therapeutic applications...|$|R

40|$|Manipulation in {{immersive}} virtual environments {{is difficult}} partly because users must {{do without the}} haptic contact with real objects they rely on {{in the real world}} to orient themselves and the objects they are manipulating. To compensate for this lack, I propose exploiting the one real object every user has in a virtual environment, his body. I present a unified framework for virtual-environment interaction based on proprioception, a person's sense of the position and orientation of his body and limbs. I describe three forms of body-relative interaction:. Direct manipulation [...] -ways to use body sense to help control manipulation. Physical mnemonics [...] -ways to store/recall information relative to the body. Gestural actions [...] -ways to use body-relative actions to issue commands Automatic scaling is a way to bring objects instantly within reach so that users can manipulate them using proprioceptive cues. Several novel virtual interaction techniques based upon automatic scaling and our proposed framework of proprioception allow a user to interact with a virtual world intuitively, <b>efficiently,</b> <b>precisely,</b> <b>and</b> lazily. Two formal user studies evaluate key aspects of body-relative interaction. The virtual docking study compares the manipulation of objects co-located with one's hand and the manipulation of objects at a distance.

The vast majority of {{studies have focused on}} muscle contractions. Although previous work has examined the motor cortex during muscle relaxation, the role of brain areas beyond motor cortex remains to be elucidated. The present study used functional magnetic resonance imaging to directly compare slow <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> controlled force generation and force relaxation in humans. Contralateral primary motor cortex and bilateral caudate nucleus had greater activity during force generation compared with force relaxation. Conversely, right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) had greater activity while relaxing force compared with generating force. Also, anterior cingulate cortex had greater deactivation while relaxing force compared with generating force. These findings were further strengthened by the fact that force output parameters such as the amplitude, rate, duration, variability, and error did not affect the brain imaging findings. These results demonstrate that the neural mechanisms underlying slow <b>and</b> <b>precisely</b> controlled force relaxation differ across prefrontal–striatal and motor cortical–striatal circuits.
