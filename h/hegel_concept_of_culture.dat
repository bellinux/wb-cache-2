40|$|The <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> praxis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{fundamental}} concepts in the history of political philosophy. The most famous example may be Marx’s statement in the eleventh thesis on Feuerbach. The close relation between praxis and polis was grounded in Aristotle’s political philosophy. <b>Hegel</b> leads this <b>concept</b> further with his <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> praxis as Sittlichkeit. Honneth and Habermas are both grounded in the young Hegel’s writings when they try to extrapolate what is essential in <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> praxis and generate a new concept, which may be valid for our time. Honneth is standing by <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> recognition, which he then is forced to leave many years later when rediscovering <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> Sittlichkeit. However, Honneth fails to reconcile praxis and Sittlichkeit. In contrast, Habermas sets in a hermeneutic maneuver language as a substitute for <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> spirit. With this new, effectively metaphysical concept, he is able to formulate a practical philosophy in which both praxis and Sittlichkeit are summarized in communicative action. Habermas’s practical philosophy follows Hegel's and extends its roots into the history of ideas, back to Aristotle’s foundation <b>of</b> the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> praxis and, in a broader sense, to the antique democracy of Athens...|$|R

40|$|This {{is a study}} {{concerning}} Hegel’s {{critic of}} Rousseau’s common will and shows how <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> freedom should be understood from this criticism. This is done first of all through a study of Rousseau’s social contract and Hegel’s Philosophy of Right. The different state theories which Rousseau and Hegel represent, are evaluated separately, first Rousseau’s then Hegel’s to see how Hegel’s philosophy {{is a continuation of}} Rousseau’s philosophy. The most important <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> this essay are Rousseau’s ”moral freedom” and <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> the ethical system. Detta är en studie om Hegels kritik av Rousseaus allmänvilja och visar hur Hegels frihetsbegrepp ska förstås utifrån denna kritik. Detta görs först och främst genom en studie av Rousseaus verk samhällsfördraget och Hegels verk Rättsfilosofin.

40|$|This is a {{preliminary}} argument {{of a much}} larger research project inquiring into the relation between Hegel’s philosophical system and the project of emancipation in Critical International Relations Theory. Specifically, the paper examines how Hegel’s theory of recognition gestures towards a form of radical cosmopolitanism in world politics to ensure the conditions of rational freedom for all humankind. Much of the paper is a ground-clearing exercise defining what is ‘living’ in Hegel’s thought for emancipatory approaches in world politics, to borrow from Croce’s now famous question. It focuses on <b>Hegel’s</b> unique <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> freedom which places recognition as central in the formation of self-consciousness and therefore as a key determinant in the conditions necessary for human freedom to emerge in political community. While {{further research is needed to}} ascertain the precise relationship between Hegel’s recognition theoretic, emancipation and cosmopolitanism, it is contended that the intersubjective basis <b>of</b> <b>Hegel’s</b> <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> freedom through recognition necessitates some form of radical cosmopolitanism that ensures successful processes of recognition between all peoples, the precise institutional form of which remains unspecified...|$|R
40|$|The key <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> has {{recently}} been undergoing critical reassessment, {{and in some cases}} replacement, by cultural theorists in a number of fields. Some commentators have argued that the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> is too elusive and all encompassing to be of use and that it can be politically dangerous. We will argue instead that the problem is not inherent in all <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture,</b> but in the specific political uses to which particular <b>concepts</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> have been put. We think {{there is a need to}} rethink the <b>concept</b> <b>of</b> <b>culture.</b> In fact, cultural coherence in the face of heterogeneity and porous boundaries, complexity, and complicity across far-reaching networks are some of the most challenging and intriguing issues in cultural theory today. Thus we explore alternative conceptions <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> that might hold some promise for cultural geography. Our view is that no one conception holds the answer. Rather, cultural geographers need to develop a critically eclectic mix <b>of</b> <b>culture</b> theories and allow sufficient time for these to be empirically grounded. ...|$|R

History and Class Consciousness, which helped to create Western Marxism, is the book for which Lukács is best known, {{and some of his}} pronouncements have become famous.

40|$|The {{experiences}} of the communist countries in Eastern Europe have {{made clear that the}} centralized planned economy (without a free market) does not function. From Hegel’s perspective, {{it can be said that}} this experience is not just coincidental: the abolition of the free market includes the abolition of the institutional framework that enables insight into the formation of particular interests. Without this insight, it becomes impossible to determine the content of the general good. Therefore, Hegel’s alternative, self-conscious planning of the economic process while the free market is preserved, seems to be unavoidable. However, it remains highly problematic whether or how this connection between planning and free market can be understood.

The second tradition was that of Marxism and progressive thought and influenced Vygotsky's thinking about such notions as tool-use and social and cultural progress.
