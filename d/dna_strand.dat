5|$|When {{only one}} of the two strands of a double helix has a defect, the other strand {{can be used as a}} {{template}} to guide the correction of the damaged strand. In order to repair damage to one of the two paired molecules of DNA, there exist a number of excision repair mechanisms that remove the damaged nucleotide and replace it with an undamaged nucleotide complementary to that found in the undamaged <b>DNA</b> <b>strand.</b>|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA that contains genetic information and can influence the phenotype of an organism. Within a gene, the sequence of bases along a <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> defines a messenger RNA sequence, which then defines one or more protein sequences. The relationship between the nucleotide sequences of genes and the amino-acid sequences of proteins {{is determined by the}} rules of translation, known collectively as the genetic code. The genetic code consists of three-letter 'words' called codons formed from {{a sequence}} of three nucleotides (e.g. ACT, CAG, TTT).|$|E
5|$|Class {{switching}} {{occurs in}} the heavy chain gene locus by a mechanism called class switch recombination (CSR). This mechanism relies on conserved nucleotide motifs, called switch (S) regions, found in DNA upstream of each constant region gene (except in the δ-chain). The <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> is broken by the activity {{of a series of}} enzymes at two selected S-regions. The variable domain exon is rejoined through a process called non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) to the desired constant region (γ, α or ε). This process results in an immunoglobulin gene that encodes an antibody of a different isotype.|$|E

40|$|A new {{patterning}} method using Deoxyribose Nucleic Acid (<b>DNA)</b> <b>strands</b> {{capable of producing}} nanogaps of less than 100 nm is proposed and investigated in this work. <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> from Bosenbergia rotunda were used as the fundamental element in patterning DNA on thin films of aluminium (Al) metal {{without the need for}} any lithographic techniques. The <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> were applied in buffer solutions onto thin films of Al on silicon (Si) and the chemical interactions between the <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> and Al creates nanometer scale arbitrary patterning by direct transfer of the <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> onto the substrate.

5|$|The {{field of}} {{molecular}} biology {{grew in the}} late twentieth century, as did its clinical application. In 1980, Yuet Wai Kan et al. suggested a prenatal genetic test for Thalassemia that did not rely upon DNA sequencingthen in its infancybut on restriction enzymes that cut DNA where they recognised specific short sequences, creating different lengths of <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> depending on which allele (genetic variation) the fetus possessed. In the 1980s, the phrase was used in the names of companies such as Molecular Diagnostics Incorporated and Bethseda Research Laboraties Molecular Diagnostics.|$|E
5|$|In living organisms, DNA {{does not}} usually {{exist as a}} single molecule, but instead {{as a pair of}} {{molecules}} that are held tightly together. These two long strands entwine like vines, {{in the shape of a}} double helix. The nucleotide contains both a segment of the backbone of the molecule (which holds the chain together) and a nucleobase (which interacts with the other <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> in the helix). A nucleobase linked to a sugar is called a nucleoside and a base linked to a sugar and one or more phosphate groups is called a nucleotide. A polymer comprising multiple linked nucleotides (as in DNA) is called a polynucleotide.|$|E
5|$|Transcription {{is carried}} out by a DNA-dependent RNA {{polymerase}} that copies the sequence of a <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> into RNA. To begin transcribing a gene, the RNA polymerase binds to a sequence of DNA called a promoter and separates the DNA strands. It then copies the gene sequence into a messenger RNA transcript until it reaches a region of DNA called the terminator, where it halts and detaches from the DNA. As with human DNA-dependent DNA polymerases, RNA polymerase II, the enzyme that transcribes most of the genes in the human genome, operates {{as part of a}} large protein complex with multiple regulatory and accessory subunits.|$|E
40|$|Topoisomerases are key {{enzymes that}} control the topological state of DNA through the {{breaking}} and rejoining of <b>DNA</b> <b>strands.</b> There are two classes of topoisomerase: type I enzymes, which act by transiently nicking {{one of the two}} <b>DNA</b> <b>strands,</b> and type II enzymes which nick both <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> and whose activity is dependent on the presence of ATP. These enzymes are involved in many vital cellula...|$|R

40|$|The {{energy of}} {{interaction}} between <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> in promoters is of great functional importance. Visualization of the energy of <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> distribution in promoter sequences was achieved. The separation of promoters in groups by their energetic properties enables evaluation of the dependence of promoter strength on the energetic properties. The analysis of groups (clusters) of promoters distributed by the energy of <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> interaction in − 55, − 35, − 10 and + 6 sequences indicates their connection with the transcriptional activity...|$|R
5|$|Cell {{division}} {{is essential for}} an organism to grow, but, when a cell divides, it must replicate the DNA in its genome so that the two daughter cells have the same genetic information as their parent. The double-stranded structure of DNA provides a simple mechanism for DNA replication. Here, the two strands are separated and then each strand's complementary DNA sequence is recreated by an enzyme called DNA polymerase. This enzyme makes the complementary strand by finding the correct base through complementary base pairing and bonding it onto the original strand. As DNA polymerases can only extend a <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> in a 5′ to 3′ direction, different mechanisms are used to copy the antiparallel strands of the double helix. In this way, the base on the old strand dictates which base appears on the new strand, and the cell ends up with a perfect copy of its DNA.|$|E
5|$|The {{backbone}} of the <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> is made from alternating phosphate and sugar residues. The sugar in DNA is 2-deoxyribose, which is a pentose (five-carbon) sugar. The sugars are joined together by phosphate groups that form phosphodiester bonds between the third and fifth carbon atoms of adjacent sugar rings. These asymmetric bonds mean a strand of DNA has a direction. In a double helix, {{the direction of the}} nucleotides in one strand is opposite to their direction in the other strand: the strands are antiparallel. The asymmetric ends of DNA strands are said to have a directionality of five prime (5′) and three prime (3′), with the 5′ end having a terminal phosphate group and the 3′ end a terminal hydroxyl group. One major difference between DNA and RNA is the sugar, with the 2-deoxyribose in DNA being replaced by the alternative pentose sugar ribose in RNA.|$|E
25|$|RNA {{polymerase}} adds RNA nucleotides (which are complementary to the nucleotides of one <b>DNA</b> <b>strand).</b>|$|E
50|$|In this fashion, {{opposite}} <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> {{are joined}} together. Subsequent cleavage and rejoining cause <b>DNA</b> <b>strands</b> to exchange their segments. Protein-protein interactions drive and direct strand exchange. Energy is not compromised, since the protein-DNA linkage {{makes up for}} the loss of the phosphodiester bond, which occurred during cleavage.|$|R

25|$|Taq {{polymerase}} lacks a 3' to 5' exonuclease activity. Thus, Taq has no error-proof-reading activity, {{which consists}} of excision of any newly misincorporated nucleotide base from the nascent (i.e., extending) <b>DNA</b> <b>strand</b> that does not match with its opposite base in the complementary <b>DNA</b> <b>strand.</b> The lack in 3' to 5' proofreading of the Taq enzyme results in a high error rate (mutations per nucleotide per cycle) of approximately 1 in 10,000 bases, which affects the fidelity of the PCR, especially if errors occur early in the PCR with low amounts of starting material, causing accumulation of {{a large proportion of}} amplified DNA with incorrect sequence in the final product.|$|E
