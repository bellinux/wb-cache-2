25|$|For example: In Pennsylvania {{there are}} two rates, basic rate and reissue rate. The basic rate would apply if it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> ten years since the last policy was issued. If less than ten years, the reissue rate applies. The reissue rate offers a {{discount}} of approximately ten percent off of the basic rate. If the transaction is a refinance, the savings can {{be as much as}} thirty percent off of the reissue rate. These rates and applicable discounts are filed with and approved by the Pennsylvania Insurance Commission.|$|E

25|$|These {{days there}} is not much disputing that Ixodes holocyclus is the main vector for Rickettsial Spotted Fever (also known as Queensland tick typhus) (causative {{organism}} the bacteria Rickettsia australis) and Flinders Island Spotted Fever (causative organism Rickettsia honei). Rickettsia australis is an obligate, intracellular bacterial parasite that proliferates within the endothelial cells of small blood vessels, causing a vasculitis. Spotted Fever is probably more common than the Lyme-like Disease. Sometimes infection with Rickettsia australis occurs without a rash - there may just be a high fever. Usually (65% of cases) there is a black spot (known as an eschar, usually 2–5mm in diameter) {{at the site of the}} tick bite. This looks like a scab with redness and swelling around it. Usually there is only one eschar unless there <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one tick bite. Often lymph glands nearby are enlarged and painful. Fever starts 1–14 days (usually 7–10 days) following the tick bite, followed within a few days by a rash. The rash can look like chicken pox as the spots may contain some fluid. Other symptoms include headache, stiff neck, nausea, vomiting, mental confusion, aching muscles and joints. The illness may be more severe in adults and elderly persons. Spotted Fever is diagnosed by two blood tests (IgM and Weil-Felix tests) taken 10 days apart. PCR analysis of skin biopsies is a more recent testing method. The disease runs its course in two weeks or so but can be cured more quickly with antibiotics (tetracyclines). As antibiotic treatment is very effective, many persons feel so well that they do not return to have the second blood sample collected. But this second blood test is important as it is the only way of proving the diagnosis of Spotted Fever. Spotted Fever rarely, if ever, occurs more than once because the body usually becomes immune for life. In rare instances there may be an apparent repeated infection after recovery - it is not known whether this is caused by another strain. It is also presently unknown if chronic infections occur. It is rarely fatal. Australian Spotted Fever was first described in 1946 when 12 soldiers contracted the disease during training exercises in north Queensland - it was at that time known as Queensland Tick Typhus (QTT). Infections generally arise in rural areas, but 10% of reported cases appear to have been acquired in major cities. It is apparently commonly seen in tick collectors in southern Queensland. It mostly occurs during the winter and spring, but can occur at any time in temperate areas.|$|E

500|$|As part of {{the bailout}} programme, Portugal was {{required}} to regain complete access to financial markets by September 2013. The first step towards this target was successfully taken on 3 October 2012, when the country managed to regain partial market access by selling a bond series with 3-year maturity. Once Portugal regains complete market access, measured as the moment it successfully manage to sell a bond series with a full 10-year maturity, {{it is expected to}} benefit from interventions by the ECB, which announced readiness to implement extended support in the form of some yield-lowering bond purchases (OMTs), aiming to bring governmental interest rates down to sustainable levels. A peak for the Portuguese 10-year governmental interest rates happened on 30 January 2012, where it reached 17.3% after the rating agencies had cut the governments credit rating to [...] "non-investment grade" [...] (also referred to as [...] "junk"). As of December 2012, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> halved to only 7%.
