30|$|Figure  1 {{presents}} the percentage {{change in the}} <b>investments</b> of the government, households, and {{rest of the world}} from the benchmark.

This implies that after the simulation, the <b>investments</b> of government and households increased continuously, whereas the <b>investments</b> of the rest of the world declined. It is important to note that the <b>investments</b> here represented both real and financial <b>investments.</b> Moreover, the figure shows that change in government <b>investments</b> was considerably greater than the change in <b>investments</b> by households. This result was expected because the ECB’s action assumed the government would increase its expenditure after receiving money from the bank’s bond purchases. Therefore, the percentage change in the level of government <b>investments</b> was greater than the change in household <b>investments.</b>|$|R
