40|$|Abstract:- This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} and implemented {{a new approach}} to detect MPEG- 2 header errors using a MD 5 hash function and information hiding technique. The video picture header information is protected by a MD 5 hash technique, and any change in the <b>header</b> <b>level</b> is detected immediately. The information hiding technique is used to locate the error block number in the corrupted MPEG- 2 video. The results show that the new approach can detect 100 % of header error at both block level and higher levels without increasing the transmission bit rate.

40|$|This {{document}} identifies some {{solutions to}} the problem stated in the Editor’s Note in clause 7. 7. 1. 1 of the MDS Study of CD, document ISO/IEC JTC 1 /SC 29 /WG 11 /N 3816. Therefore this document is intended as a contribution to the MDS group. Presently {{there is no way to}} instantiate an Ordering Key DS within a “valid” MPEG- 7 description. To solve this problem three proposals are here considered and their respective implication are discussed. The first proposal is to derive the OrderingKeyType as an extension of the HeaderType allowing the instantiation, at the <b>header</b> <b>level,</b> of any MPEG- 7 Complete/Unit Description and DSType instances. The second solution is to include the OrderingKey DS as a component of the BasicDescriptionType. This allows to apply the ordering tool only in an MPEG- 7 Complete Description, but no Unit Description. The third solution is to adopt both the first and second proposals. In Section 2 the three solutions are detailed and the required modification in terms of syntax and usage are discussed. In Section 3 the three solutions are compared...|$|E

The goal of this thesis {{was to develop a}} plugin that would comfortably enable the splitting and merging of pages in Zim without the user losing track of his texts and their organizational structure. While solving the problem it appeared inevitable to modify the main rogram. New functionality was implemented that allows the transfer of the page content into a page subtree.

They {{were being}} {{rendered}} twice, leading to invalid XML in default JATS output with pandoc-citeproc. lua-filters. md: use real-world man page filter as example. Add lua filter functions walk_inline and walk_block in the pandoc module, to apply filters inside particular inline and block elements. Refactored some code from Text. Pandoc. Lua. PandocModule into new internal module Text. Pandoc. Lua. Filter. Markdown reader: Allow fenced code blocks to be indented 1 - 3 spaces (# 4011). This brings our handling {{of them into}} alignment with CommonMark's. Fix YAML metadata with "chomp" (|-). Previously if a YAML block under |- contained a blank line, pandoc would not parse it as metadata. Removed etc. from abbreviations file. Often etc. ends a sentence, and we want the period {{to be treated as}} a sentence-ending period. Fix regression with [...] metadata (# 4054). Values specified with [...] metadata should replace a metadata value set in the document itself, rather than creating a list including a new value. EPUB writer: Fix EPUB OCF structure. # 3720 had been improperly implemented. Fix modified paths for raw HTML tags (src, poster, etc.) (# 4050, # 4055). This had not been updated for the new EPUB container layout, with a separate text/ subdirectory. Fix image paths with empty [...] epub-subdirectory. Miscellaneous code cleanup (Alexander Krotov). Use pandoc-types 1. 17. 3, which adds Walkable instances for [Block] Block and [Inline] Inline. Remove obsolete stack. full. yaml (# 4052). Change to using pandoc-citeproc 0. 12. 1 in binary packages. Consolidate math output method documentation (# 4049, Mauro Bieg). MANUAL. txt: fix <b>header</b> <b>level</b> of "Extension: emoji" (Albert Krewinkel). Use lua filter to generate man page from MANUAL. txt, replacing old Haskell filters. This is easier and faster.

40|$|Added jats as {{an input}} format. Add Text. Pandoc. Readers. JATS, {{exporting}} readJATS (API change) (Hamish Mackenzie). Improved citation handling in JATS reader. JATS citations are now converted to pandoc citations, and JATS ref-lists are {{converted into a}} references field in metadata, suitable for use with pandoc-citeproc. Thus a JATS article with embedded bibliographic information can be processed with pandoc and pandoc-citeproc to produce a formatted bibliography. Allow [...] list-extensions to take an optional FORMAT argument. This lists the extensions set by default for the selected FORMAT. The extensions are now alphabetized, and the + or - indicating the default setting comes before, rather than after, the extension. Markdown reader: Preserve original whitespace between blocks. Recognize as context. Be pickier about table captions. A caption starts with a : which can't be followed by punctuation. Otherwise we can falsely interpret {{the start of a}} fenced div, or even a table header line like : [...] :|: [...] :, as a caption. Always use four space rule for example lists. It would be awkward to indent example list contents to the first non-space character after the label, since example list labels are often long. Thanks to Bernhard Fisseni for the suggestion. Improve raw tex parsing. Note that the Markdown reader is also affected by the latex_macros extension changes described below under the LaTeX reader. LaTeX reader: latex_macros extension changes (# 4179). Don't pass through macro definitions themselves when latex_macros is set. The macros have already been applied. If latex_macros is enabled, then rawLaTeXBlock in Text. Pandoc. Readers. LaTeX will succeed in parsing a macro definition, and will update pandoc's internal macro map accordingly, but the empty string will be returned. Export tokenize, untokenize (API change). Use applyMacros in rawLaTeXBlock, rawLaTeXInline. Refactored inlineCommand. Fix bug in tokenizer. Material following ^^ was dropped if it wasn't a character escape. This only affected invalid LaTeX, so we didn't see it in the wild, but it appeared in a QuickCheck test failure. Fix regression in LateX tokenization (# 4159). This mainly affects the Markdown reader when parsing raw LaTeX with escaped spaces. Add tests of LaTeX tokenizer. Support from babel. Be more tolerant of & character (# 4208). This allows us to parse unknown tabular environments as raw LaTeX. Muse reader (Alexander Krotov) : Parse anchors immediately after headings as IDs. Require that note references does not start with 0. Parse empty comments correctly. Org reader (Albert Krewinkel) : Fix asterisks-related parsing error (# 4180). Support minlevel option for includes (# 4154). The level of headers in included files can be shifted to a higher level by specifying a minimum <b>header</b> <b>level</b> via the :minlevel parameter. E. g. #+include: "tour. org" :minlevel 1 will shift the headers in tour. org such that the topmost headers become level 1 headers. Break-up org reader test file into multiple modules. OPML reader: Enable raw HTML and other extensions by default for notes (# 4164). This fixes a regression in 2. 0. Note that extensions can now be individually disabled, e. g. -f opml-smart-raw_html. RST reader: Allow empty list items (# 4193). More accurate parsing of references (# 4156). Previously we erroneously included the enclosing backticks in a reference ID (# 4156). This change also disables interpretation of syntax inside references, as in docutils. So, there is no emphasis in `my *link*`_. Docx reader: Continue lists after interruption (# 4025, Jesse Rosenthal). Docx expects that lists will continue where they left off after an interruption and introduces a new id if a list is starting again. So we keep track of the state of lists and use them to define a "start" attribute, if necessary. Add tests for structured document tags unwrapping (Jesse Rosenthal). Preprocess Document body to unwrap w:sdt elements (Jesse Rosenthal, # 4190). Plain writer: Don't linkify table of contents. RST writer: Fix anchors for headers (# 4188). We were missing an _. PowerPoint writer (Jesse Rosenthal) : Treat lists inside BlockQuotes as lists. We don't yet produce incremental lists in PowerPoint, but we should at least treat lists inside BlockQuotes as lists, for compatibility with other slide formats. Add ability to force size. This replaces the more specific blockQuote runProp, which only affected the size of blockquotes. We can use this for notes, etc. Implement notes. This currently prints all notes on a final slide. Note that at the moment, there is a danger of text overflowing the note slide, since there is no logic for adding further slides. Implement basic definition list functionality to PowerPoint writer. Don't look for default template file for Powerpoint (# 4181). Add pptx to isTextFormat list. This is used to check standalone and not writing to the terminal. Obey slide level option (Jesse Rosenthal). Introduce tests. Docx writer: Ensure that distArchive is the one that comes with pandoc (# 4182). Previously a reference. docx in /. pandoc (or the user data dir) would be used instead, and this could cause problems because a user-modified docx sometimes lacks vital sections that we count on the distArchive to supply. Org writer: Do not wrap "-" to avoid accidental bullet lists (Alexander Krotov). Don't allow fn refs to wrap to beginning of line (# 4171, with help from Alexander Krotov). Otherwise they can be interpreted as footnote definitions. Muse writer (Alexander Krotov) : Don't wrap note references to the next line (# 4172). HTML writer: Use br elements in line blocks instead of relying on CSS (# 4162). HTML-based templates have had the custom CSS for div. line-block removed. Those maintaining custom templates will want to remove this too. We still enclose line blocks in a div with class line-block. LaTeX writer: Use r with babel (# 4161). This avoids a clash with a deprecated command defined in Babel. Allow fragile=singleslide attribute in beamer slides (# 4169). Use after in headerless tables (# 4207). FB 2 writer: Add cover image specified by cover-image meta (Alexander Krotov, # 4195). JATS writer (Hamish Mackenzie) : Support writing and elements with and inside them by using Divs with class set to one of fig, table-wrap or caption (Hamish Mackenzie). The title is included as a Heading so the constraint on where Heading can occur is also relaxed. Leave out empty alt attributes on links. Deduplicate image mime type code. Make optional in and (# 4178). Self closing tags for empty xref (# 4187). Improve support for code language. Custom writer: Use init file to setup Lua interpreter (Albert Krewinkel). The same init file (data/init) that is used to setup the Lua interpreter for Lua filters is also used to setup the interpreter of custom writers. lua. Define instances for newtype wrapper (Albert Krewinkel). The custom writer used its own ToLuaStack instance definitions, which made it difficult to share code with Lua filters, as this could result in conflicting instances. A Stringify wrapper is introduced to avoid this problem. Added tests for custom writer. Fixed definition lists and tables in data/sample. lua. Fixed regression: when target is PDF, writer extensions were being ignored. So, for example, pandoc -t latex-smart -o file. pdf did not work properly. Lua modules (Albert Krewinkel) : Add pandoc. utils module, to hold utility functions. Create a Haskell module Text. Pandoc. Lua. Module. Pandoc to define the pandoc lua module. Make a Haskell module for each Lua module. Move definitions for the pandoc. mediabag modules to a separate Haskell module. Move sha 1 from the main pandoc module to pandoc. utils. Add function pandoc. utils. hierarchicalize (convert list of Pandoc blocks into (hierarchical) list of Elements). Add function pandoc. utils. normalize_date (parses a date and converts it (if possible) to "YYYY-MM-DD" format). Add function pandoc. utils. to_roman_numeral (allows conversion of numbers below 4000 into roman numerals). Add function pandoc. utils. stringify (converts any AST element to a string with formatting removed). data/init. lua: load pandoc. utils by default Turn pipe, read into full Haskell functions. The pipe and read utility functions are converted from hybrid lua/haskell functions into full Haskell functions. This avoids the need for intermediate _pipe/_read helper functions, which have dropped. pandoc. lua: re-add missing MetaMap function. This was a bug introduced in version 2. 0. 4. Text. Pandoc. Class: Add insertInFileTree [API change]. This gives a pure way to insert an ersatz file into a FileTree. In addition, we normalize paths both on insertion and on lookup. Text. Pandoc. Shared: export blocksToInlines' (API change, Maura Bieg). Text. Pandoc. MIME: Add opus to MIME type table as audio/ogg (# 4198). Text. Pandoc. Extensions: Alphabetical order constructors for Extension. This makes them appear in order in [...] list-extensions. Allow lenient decoding of latex error logs, which are not always properly UTF 8 -encoded (# 4200). Update latex template to work with recent versions of beamer. The old template produced numbered sections with some recent versions of beamer. Thanks to Thomas Hodgson. Updated reference. docx (# 4175). Instead of just "Hello, world", the document now contains exemplars of most of the styles that have an effect on pandoc documents. This makes it easier to see the effect of style changes. Removed default. theme data file (# 4096). It is no longer needed now that we have [...] print-highlight-style. Added stack. lts 9. yaml for building with lts 9 and ghc 8. 0. 2. We still need this for the alpine static linux build, since we don't have ghc 8. 2. 2 for that yet. Removed stack. pkg. yaml. We only really need stack. yaml; we can put flag settings for pandoc-citeproc there. Makefile: Add 'trypandoc' and 'pandoc-templates' targets to make releases easier. MANUAL. txt: Add note on what formats have +smart by default. Use native syntax for custom-style (# 4174, Mauro Bieg). Introduce dedicated Extensions section, since some extensions affect formats other than markdown (Mauro Bieg, # 4204). Clarify default html output for [...] section-divs (Richard Edwards). filters. md: say that Text. Pandoc. JSON comes form pandoc-types.

40|$|In {{many large}} chemoinformatics {{database}} systems, molecules {{are represented by}} long binary fingerprint vectors whose components record {{the presence or absence}} in the molecular graphs of particular functional groups or combinatorial features, such as labeled paths or labeled trees. To speed up database searches, we propose to store with each fingerprint a small header vector containing primarily the result of applying the logical exclusive OR (XOR) operator to the fingerprint vector after modulo wrapping to a smaller number of bits, such as 128 bits. From the XOR headers of two molecules, tight bounds on the intersection and union of their fingerprint vectors can be rapidly obtained, yielding tight bounds on derived similarity measures, such as the Tanimoto measure. During a database search, every time these bounds are unfavorable, the corresponding molecule can be rapidly discarded with no need for further inspection. We derive probabilistic models that allow us to estimate precisely the behavior of the XOR <b>headers</b> and the <b>level</b> of pruning under different conditions in terms of similarity threshold and fingerprint density. These theoretical results are corroborated by experimental results on a large set of molecules. For a Tanimoto threshold of 0. 5 (respectively 0. 9), this approach requires searching less than 50 % (respectively 10 %) of the database, leading to typical search speedups of 2 to 3 times over the previous state-of-the-art. 1...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a header compression algorithm that unlike previous protocols {{is capable of}} compressing MAC headers in a multiple-access (shared) channel. Previous schemes could not compress MAC headers because the address fields are needed to identify the intended destination {{as well as the}} intended context space under which compressed headers are to be interpreted. We approach this problem by sharing a single context space among participating nodes. The compression context for a new flow between two nodes is initialized and synchronized by transmitting an uncompressed frame with a context label that is randomly selected by the sender. Frames with compressed MAC headers will have no address fields. A receiving node that has a context which matches the label in a compressed frame will be able to decompress the header by expanding the label into the corresponding fields stored in the context. Mechanisms are presented to address label conflicts where a node is receiving compressed frames with the same label from multiple senders. We evaluate our work by simulating an 802. 11 network that implements the header compression algorithm. The simulation results show that when MAC headers are compressed there is throughput improvement of up to 15 % in the experiments we conducted. This is in addition to the throughput improvement achieved by compressing IP, TCP, UDP and higher <b>level</b> <b>headers...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{innovative}} use {{of fixed}} screens to reject solids in condenser cooling water drawn from Lake Michigan {{has been considered}} a practical solution for the lake withdrawal system proposed at the James H. Campbell, Unit No. 3 Of the Consumer Power Company. The withdrawal point, which is 3, 500 feet offshore and approximately 30 feet below the lake surface, is considered relatively free of screen-plugging. solids under normal conditions, but during winter, frazil ice plugging is possible. To assure continued operation under these unusual conditions it was considered necessary to provide the system with an opened water (non-screened) auxiliary intake. This auxiliary function is to be provided by installing a relief valve at the outer or stub end {{of two of the}} four header pipes which are to constitu. te the intake system as shown in Fig. 1. These valves are to open and provide. auxiliary intake water whenever screen plugging resulted in a selected level of pressure reduction within the <b>header.</b> The selected <b>level</b> proposed for the valve operation was 12 inches additional headloss. The valve deemed most appropriate for use was a modified version of a Synchro-chek valve made by the W. J. Woolley Company of River Forest, Illinois. The Woolley valve has been marketed for many years as a pump discharge check valve, but its performance under Wave conditions, including 100 year storms, at the proposed site were unknown. In order to clarify the valve. performance it was decided to conduct tests of a 1 : 4 scale-model valve at the St. Anthony Falls Hydraulic Laboratory of the University of Minnesota. The material which follows describes the Woolley valve, the three part test program (static, steady state flow, and dynamic flow), the test facilities, the test results, and the conclusions and recommendations resulting from the tests.
