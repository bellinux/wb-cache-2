The total length of the quays was approximately 4,770 metre with water depth between 7.5 m to 9.5 m.|$|R
30|$|Understanding {{what the}} term <b>free</b> <b>port</b> <b>covers</b> {{is the first}} step to {{approach}} the structure of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> The Atlas of the Free Zones in the World (Bost, 2010), compiled more than forty-five different names that have been used related to the concept of free zones. According to the author, these terms are often used interchangeably, and sometimes they are simply marketing terms from the promoters of a zone. Therefore, there is confusion about both definitions and concepts. From this taxonomy, it is considered that free zone is a concept that can be divided into two categories: export processing zones that are manufacturing-oriented free zones and free trade zones that are trade-oriented free zones. The World Bank (2008; Farole, 2011) has the same dual approach by using the term special economic zone while referring to a free zone. This term makes sense if the status of such zones is considered although it creates confusion because there is a specific Chinese model of free zones named Special Economic Zones and this model covers only a part of the concept. <b>Free</b> <b>port,</b> however, is the long-standing terminology of such zones and refers to the logistic function of the concept (Lavissière et al., 2014). It is argued that the term <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is a transversal concept of free zones and a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> can either be an export processing zone or a free trade zone. It is therefore the term that has been retained.|$|R
50|$|Zayed <b>Port</b> <b>covers</b> {{an area of}} 535 {{hectares}} {{and contains}} 21 berths with depths ranging from 6 to 15 metres and a total berth length of 4,375 metres. It's one of four major ports in the emirate: the city's Zayed Port remains the gateway for general cargo vessels, RORO (roll-on/roll-off) and is emerging as a destination for international luxury cruise ship tourism; the nearby <b>Free</b> <b>Port</b> caters to smaller vessels, tugs, barges and service crafts; Musaffah Port {{is located in the}} heart of the industrial township of Musaffah; while the new state-of-the-art Khalifa Port in Taweelah handles all the emirate's container shipping.|$|R
30|$|The {{external}} factor {{involves the}} political and administrative context of the <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> exist because there are frictions to international trade created by boundaries between different regulatory regimes (Lavissière, 2014) and as such <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> provide a form of extraterritoriality as well as logistical services to mitigate these frictions. Therefore, {{the evolution of the}} institutions that generate administrative frictions and customs barriers has had an influence on the evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Early <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were connecting two customs areas outside of their own. Then, <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> developed within nation states. This changed the trade function because <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> became a link between domestic legal provisions and the outside. French <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in the mercantilist era, and later on Spanish <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and American Foreign Trade Zones are examples of entities set to mitigate the complexity of domestic customs and global markets.|$|R
50|$|However, facing hard {{commercial}} competition with Dalian, which {{had also been}} a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> since 1899, Vladivostok got back its status of <b>free</b> <b>port</b> in 1904; it corresponds {{to the loss of}} Port Arthur - also a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> - during the Russo-Japanese War. The peace conditions offered by Russia to Japan in 1905 included maintaining the status of <b>free</b> <b>port</b> in Vladivostok.|$|R
30|$|This paper aims rationalizing the {{complexity}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> It {{is based on a}} wide array of empirical observations and an analysis of structure, function and evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Collected <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> data enabled the identification of three constitutive factors of evolution: an external factor (the jurisdiction), an internal factor (the services provided) and a linking factor (the orientation of flows). Based on these three factors a model of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> was designed with a typology of thirteen types of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> an explanation of their evolution, and their future prospects.|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> along with globalization of trade is another major factor. The adaptation of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> to wider ranges of services {{in order to}} cope with evolutions of supply chains is another factor. Logistics functions of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> have become more complex and complete to cope with global supply chains and incorporate <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in the international trade system. Adding this factor explains {{a large part of}} the {{evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> but it does not cover the different types of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and especially the free trade zone system that is predominantly developed in OECD countries and the Export Processing Zone system that is only present in developing countries.|$|R
30|$|Interviews {{have been}} {{conducted}} from 2007 to 2015 as part of ongoing research projects on <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> More than 50 interviews {{have been conducted}} in 17 countries on 4 continents (Brazil, Cameroon, China, France, French Guyana, Germany, Madagascar, Malaysia, Mauritius, Morocco, Panama, Singapore, Spain, Tunisia, UAE, UK, and USA.) Interviewees were government agents, free zone administrators, customs officers, investors, logisticians, manufacturers and operators of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> In most of the countries direct observation of the <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> was possible and brought valuable data. Finally, in few <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> (Mauritius <b>Free</b> <b>Port,</b> Ehoala Park, Tangier-Med, Manaus Suframa, Radès, and Kribi) participant observations was possible due to the involvement in audits, creation, restructuration or development of <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> during consulting missions. The authors thus bring {{a wide array of}} empirical observations with their academic and professional interactions with actors involved in <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R

30|$|The {{first factor}} {{emerging}} from the case study is customs extraterritoriality. This is the core characteristics of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{and one that is}} present in every <b>free</b> <b>port</b> studied, although it evolved in time. Customs extraterritoriality is a juridical factor making the link between the structure of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> and its environment. This factor alone, however, is not sufficient to explain the evolution of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and their wide variety. Moreover, the reduction of customs barriers with the GATT and then the WTO, while <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were growing in number proves that the sole customs extraterritoriality is not fully explaining the issue.|$|R
30|$|Several {{questions}} {{remains to}} be answered. First, under what circumstances are the decisions made to open, to expand {{as well as to}} close a <b>free</b> <b>port?</b> For instance, in 2013 Hamburg forfeited its <b>free</b> <b>port</b> status, which it held for centuries. This underlines that the arbitrage that the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> provided was no longer judged to be valuable enough to maintain. Another example being post-Brexit UK striving to create <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in order to position itself as a major supply chain link between the Commonwealth and the E.U. (Sunak, 2016). This underlines that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> could even thrive in a global context of potential trade restrictions since their arbitrage function would be even more prevalent. Second, {{further research is needed to}} compare the different <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> models and identify macro-economic as well as geographical factors driving the development of a specific model. This could provide analytical and decision-making tools to better understand the dynamics of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and how they continue to support global trade and supply chains. It is also unclear how path dependent different <b>free</b> <b>port</b> models are, implying that once a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> has been established, to what extent it can evolve into new forms and new value propositions. Still, it is fairly surprising that in light of ongoing trade liberalization, including the setting of economic blocs, that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> remain an active and even thriving element of global trade.|$|R
50|$|Some special {{economic}} {{zones are}} called <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> Sometimes they {{have historically been}} endowed with favorable customs regulations such as the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> of Trieste. In recent years the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> system {{has been accused of}} facilitating international art crime, allowing stolen artworks to remain undetected in storage for decades.|$|R
40|$|<b>Freeing</b> <b>ports</b> {{on fishing}} vessels are a {{significant}} safety feature. They are designed to reduce the build up of green water on deck {{that may lead to}} loss of stability. At a more mundane level they reduce wetness on decks that are the working platforms for the fishers. Wet decks that are moving working platforms are clearly a hazard. The present study deals more with the build up of water on deck rather than just general deck wetness. It attempts to quantify the amount of water on deck for different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations, using parameters such as number of <b>freeing</b> <b>ports,</b> <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> areas, deck area etc. The study uses numerical simulations to evaluate these parameters. One particular vessel has been used throughout the study, namely a typical fibreglass 65 foot fishing vessel of recent design. The main conclusions of the study are that generally there is not a great deal of difference between the amounts of water on deck for the different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations. Although larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> allow more water on deck if the ingress and egress of water flowing through the <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> is unhindered in both directions, for <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> fitted with some device (such as 2 ̆ 018 flaps 2 ̆ 019) that hinders the in-flow but not the out-flow then having larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> is shown to be beneficial. The benefits here are more to do with stability than general deck wetness. It is in fact clear from some of the results that larger <b>freeing</b> <b>ports</b> lead to wetter decks. The motions of the vessel in the study with water on deck have been evaluated and it is shown that different <b>freeing</b> <b>port</b> configurations can lead to different motions of the vessel, particularly {{in the early stages of}} flooding.

30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> {{are based}} on a form of exceptionalism which has existed since Antiquity. They have seen their role and {{function}} evolve to follow political, economic and technological developments, particularly as they relate to international trade routes. Because of these changes, some <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> disappeared while others gained and lost their importance with the ebb and flows of global trade. Globalization underlines the enduring fundamental niche that <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> play as international trade gateways, with most countries having a regulatory environment enabling <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> with some actively promoting them. Their use remains a market strategy for actors seeking a form of arbitrage such as traders, transport and logistics companies and even financial firms. They have been effective tools of transnationalism as the examples of Shenzhen and Dubai underline. Yet, <b>free</b> <b>port</b> status does not guarantee economic development since there are numerous <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> that provided limited economic and trade impetus. The insertion of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> within existing trade networks remains a key factor in their success, but this success is often observed afterwards.|$|R
30|$|The historical, {{structural}} and functional analyses of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> mentioned above, {{made possible the}} identification of major factors describing {{the wide range of}} existing <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
3000|$|In addition, it {{is crucial}} to avoid {{confusion}} on what a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are different from free trade zones, special economic zones and export processing zones, because they are logistic oriented free zones whatever their free zone status or name. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are also different from the concepts of sea ports and port terminal; they are special logistics zones next to ports. The definition of <b>free</b> <b>port</b> from Lavissière et al. (2014) was retained. It states that ‘A <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is an international logistic interface that is free from border frictions and designed to bring more value in the global supply chains of its operators. This definition states that the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is not the port, but the logistics facility ‘often next to a sea port but also next to or within an airport, a river port, or a dry port.’ [...]...|$|R
30|$|The {{evolution}} of the external factor follows three stages: a city state or depot stage, in which the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> {{does not belong to}} any customs entity; then a customs entity stage in which the <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> links an external customs area and a domestic customs area; and last a network of duty free zones connecting <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> inside or outside the same customs area.|$|R
30|$|The {{literature}} thus underlines {{a functional}} and modal specialization of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are developed {{adjacent to a}} wide range of transport nodes, including sea ports, air ports, river ports, and dry ports (railyards). The relevance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is underlined by the increasing number of countries developing them and the amount of Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) invested in these zones around the world (Farole, 2011).|$|R
30|$|In {{terms of}} organization, Lafargue (2008) points an {{evolution}} in the governance of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> from publicly managed entities to landlord free zones, while Bost (2011) underlines the ongoing specialization of free zones to cater to specific supply chains. <b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving with the range of added value activities they provide from labor intensive to high value added products (Barbier and Véron, 1991). In the same manner, services offered by <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> are evolving to include ancillary services such as finance and insurance (Tiefenbrun, 2012). These organizational and marketing drivers represent the internal factors {{of the evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b>|$|R
30|$|At the microeconomic level, {{few studies}} show the {{advantages}} for {{users of the}} <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> This core function is briefly mentioned by Tiefenbrun (2012) in a list of advantages for users of American foreign trade zones. These advantages are mostly commercial, fiscal and financial. Lafargue (2008) explains there are different advantages and functions of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> for the four categories of actors mentioned: State, Regulator, Developer and Users. Lavissière et al. (2014) explained that the main function of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> is to reduce border frictions for international supply chains through fiscal, logistical and cultural advantages. Barbier and Véron (1991) incorporated several of these elements {{in order to show}} an evolution in time of the function of <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> The more developed the <b>free</b> <b>port,</b> the wider services are.|$|R
50|$|Vladivostok's <b>free</b> <b>port</b> is {{ruled by}} a juridic system benefiting the {{business}} and investment activities. Residents of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> are granted some privileges: light taxation, simplified customs and visa procedures, facilitated administration procedures.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Free</b> <b>Port</b> Act {{was passed}} in 1766 also in 1766 the Declaratory Act was passed with the Revenue Act of 1766 and more see list of acts of {{parliament}} and the Stamp Act was repealed with the Sugar act. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> act stated that trade could be made with French and Spanish colonies. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> act was a modified system in use by the French, and Dutch.|$|R
30|$|The {{internal}} factor {{relates to}} {{the function of the}} <b>free</b> <b>port</b> and the services it provides. Initially <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> were only a transloading infrastructure and many eventually developed as added value platforms. Hanseatic ports of the twelfth century brought transformation activities to the storage function. In time, <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> kept adding services of increasing complexity; from manufacturing to supply chain services and offshore banking facilities. Furthermore, in the twenty-first century a specialization emerged where the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> specializes in logistics and supply chain services while other adjacent zones are specializing in banking, IT services, or manufacturing. The <b>free</b> <b>port</b> focuses on its core competencies and becomes part of a local network of specialized free zones. From that perspective, three stages in the evolution and complexification of this internal factors can be identified; storage, transformation and logistics and supply chain services.|$|R

30|$|Today, few <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{remain at}} the level of a city state, but there are notable {{exceptions}} such as Singapore, Hong Kong, Malta and Dubai. Still, they belong to larger economic entities having a common customs regulatory regime. Nowadays, there are <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> connecting to a network of free zones. These <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> are incorporating different types of free zones such as industry and services into a ‘free zone area’. Mauritius, for instance, linked the free zones of its port and airport to industrial zones producing textile and then developed an IT dedicated free zone (Lavissière, 2014). All these zones are linked commercially but also physically within customs corridors (where flows are permitted on the domestic system as long as they go from one element of the free zone to another). Tanger-Med has a similar development strategy with its port, a planned airport, an automotive free zone, a logistics <b>free</b> <b>port,</b> an industrial <b>free</b> zone and an offshore banking free zone. This model illustrates a regionalization of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> by permitting a specialization of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> functions within the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> itself as well as through satellite facilities. Thus, the regulatory framework of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> corresponds to infrastructural developments of transport terminals in regard to their hinterland. Tanger-Med and Barcelona Free Zone also signed an agreement on promotion, exchange of best practices and trade facilitation that creates a customs free corridor between the two entities. In the United States, free zones are technically networked since it is possible to move goods from one zone to another without disbursing custom duties. Still, this status is in its infancy at the transnational level and {{it remains to be seen}} the scale and extent <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> will create effective trade networks.|$|R

30|$|This paper {{provided}} a conceptualization of contemporary <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> and underlined three main factors explaining {{the evolution of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports,</b> which was concomitant with the evolution of international trade. They include the regulatory context, the function and trade orientation. These three factors helped articulate models explaining the development of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> {{in a variety of}} contexts. In addition, these factors helped understand what drives the transition from one model to another. Based upon this evolution it is possible to infer about a prospective <b>free</b> <b>port</b> model that would involve networks of free trade clusters through strategic agreements. As such, the current trend underlines that trade gateways could further consolidate their role by networking their free zones with other gateways with which they have functional relations. This would obviously require more advanced forms of trade facilitation measures and customs agreements, but networked <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> would support more competitive supply chains, particularly if they enhance the complementarity of the trade relations they support. Therefore, stakeholders have active interests in supporting the emergence of these <b>free</b> <b>port</b> clusters. These decisions are likely going to be made where there is a strong complementarity in the value-added functions, particularly with reverse trade flows.|$|R
30|$|Trade flows {{underlines the}} nature and {{evolution}} of the trade supported by the <b>free</b> <b>port.</b> Initially, a <b>free</b> <b>port</b> {{was at the center}} of a regional trade system because transportation was only allowing trade over short distances, while long distance trade was marginal at best. This was particularly the case during the Middle Ages. During the mercantilism era, the scale and scope of trade routes expanded and many <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> developed as colonial outposts (Bost, 2010). While the trade routes were longer and more extensive, the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> remained mostly a point of transshipment between areas where goods were produced and colonial consumption markets. Globalization changed the organization of production and, therefore, the orientation of trade flows (Rodrigue, 2017). The spatial division of production and the growing reliance on logistics transformed the function of many <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> from single transloading points along sequential trade flows towards nodes within global value chains (Lavissière et al., 2016).|$|R

The goal of this research is to consider the conceptual issues of the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> of Vladivostok, to outline the conditions and prospects of its operation and identify risks associated with its future development. The article defines the modern concept of “free port”, characterizes historical experience of the “free port” regime in Vladivostok in the end of the 19 th century, substantiates the strategic importance of using the <b>free</b> <b>port</b> of Vladivostok as a tool of intensive growth of Russian Far Eastern territories.

30|$|<b>Free</b> <b>ports</b> {{have also}} been a {{development}} tool for Asian economies. Bost (2010) underlined that a parallel exists between export-oriented industrialization {{and the use of}} <b>free</b> <b>ports.</b> For example, Taiwan and South Korea started export-oriented industrialization by setting their first free zones in Kaohsiung and Masan in the 1960 s (Amirahmadi and Weiping, 1995). When other Asian countries such as Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and the Philippines started to consider export-oriented development, they also implemented free zones. The recent setting of <b>free</b> <b>ports</b> in Madagascar, Morocco and Tunisia underlines a similar strategy (Lavissière, 2014).|$|R
