500|$|On October 27, 1999 he {{was hospitalized}} in an {{automobile}} driven by Derrick Coleman. [...] Coleman had been driving an Sport utility vehicle and had collided with a tractor trailer and was charged with drunk driving. [...] Coleman was eventually acquitted of the charges and found guilty of [...] "unsafe movement". [...] Recasner endured a fractured right shoulder, partially collapsed lung and other injuries, and a female passenger was also hospitalized. [...] He missed 52 games due to the accident and {{when he returned to}} the lineup he only played in seven games. [...] Recasner was very upset with Coleman who did not even check in on whether Recasner was O.K. for over a week after the accident. [...] On Christmas Eve 1999 during his time on the injured reserve, Recasner dragged a Continental Airlines clerk across a table by his necktie in frustration while attempting to book a flight to Texas to visit his sister, who was involved in a serious car accident.

60|$|His great friend, {{for that}} matter, was still absent, {{as well as}} remarkably silent; even {{at the end of}} three weeks Miss Gostrey hadn't come back. She wrote to him from Mentone, admitting that he must judge her grossly inconsequent--perhaps in fact for the time odiously faithless; but asking for patience, for a <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence,</b> {{throwing}} herself in short on his generosity. For her too, she could assure him, life was complicated--more complicated than he could have guessed; she had moreover made certain of him--certain of not wholly missing him on her return--before her disappearance. If furthermore she didn't burden him with letters it was frankly because of her sense of the other great commerce he had to carry on. He himself, {{at the end of a}} fortnight, had written twice, to show how his generosity could be trusted; but he reminded himself in each case of Mrs. Newsome's epistolary manner at the times when Mrs. Newsome kept off delicate ground. He sank his problem, he talked of Waymarsh and Miss Barrace, of little Bilham and the set over the river, with whom he had again had tea, and he was easy, for convenience, about Chad and Madame de Vionnet and Jeanne. He admitted that he continued to see them, he was decidedly so confirmed a haunter of Chad's premises and that young man's practical intimacy with them was so undeniably great; but he had his reason for not attempting to render for Miss Gostrey's benefit the impression of these last days. That would be to tell her too much about himself--it being at present just from himself he was trying to escape.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence</b> is {{not exactly}} the same as an ACOD. One of the primary {{differences}} is that receiving an ACOD doesn't require an admission of guilt or plea of guilty unlike a <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence</b> which requires such. Upon completion of the ACOD, the charges are automatically sealed, fingerprints & mugshots are destroyed, and the arrest is annulled. There is no conviction and all rights you had prior to arrest are restored. In order to enter the <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence</b> program, a plea of guilt must be made. Even though successful completion of a <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence</b> results in a dismissal of charges and guilty plea withdrawal, most states still consider it to be a conviction since a plea of guilt was entered and you were considered [...] "convicted" [...] {{for the duration of the}} program. Furthermore, completion of a <b>deferred</b> <b>sentence</b> program usually requires a request to the court to have the underlying charges and arrest sealed.|$|E

Also in September the University announced it sought $695,000 in restitution from Webber.

Webber stated that he did not feel the University's request was appropriate because he had not stolen from the University.|$|R
50|$|Robert Soblen was not indicted until 1960.

His trial, at which Jack was a primary witness, ended with his conviction. The judge <b>deferred</b> <b>sentencing</b> until August, and stated that {{the severity of the}} sentence would depend on whether Soblen was willing to provide a full account of his espionage to the government. Soblen remained defiant and refused to cooperate, and on 7 August 1961, was sentenced to life imprisonment. Soblen, suffering from leukemia, was released on $100,000 bail pending an appeal. His conviction was upheld by the U.S. Court of Appeals in March 1962, and an appeal to the Supreme Court was rejected in June 1962.

5000|$|The defense {{attorney}} {{claimed that the}} boys were intoxicated and that their taped confessions were inadmissible. However, under cross-examination, David Beagles admitted that his confession was voluntary. The defense tried to present the men as reputable and incapable of committing such a heinous crime.

The jury read the verdict out loud: “guilty with a recommendation for mercy.” The “recommendation for mercy” part of the sentence kept the four men from facing the electric chair. Judge Walker <b>deferred</b> <b>sentencing</b> for 15 days, and sent the four men to Raiford prison, now Florida State Prison. On June 15, 1959, Judge Walker sentenced all four men to life in prison.

40|$|Supervision ” {{means the}} {{oversight}} exercised by authorities of a sending or receiving state over an offender {{for a period}} of time determined by a court or releasing authority, during which time the offender is required to report to or be monitored by supervising authorities, and to comply with regulations and conditions, other than monetary conditions, imposed on the offender at the time of the offender’s release to the community or during the period of supervision in the community. To determine if an offender’s case in the sending state triggers the compact definition of supervision, the sending state should first examine whether or not the offender’s offense is compact eligible. If the offender has been convicted of a felony, qualifying misdemeanor or <b>deferred</b> <b>sentenced,</b> then two questions should be asked. First, is the offender required to report or be monitored by supervising authorities? Second, is the offender required to comply with regulations and conditions other than monetary conditions?
