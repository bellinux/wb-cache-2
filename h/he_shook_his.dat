25|$|Nimzovich {{suffered}} from the delusion that he was unappreciated and that the reason was malice. All it took to make him blossom, as I later learned, was a little praise. His paranoia was most evident when he dined in company. He always thought he was served much smaller portions than everyone else. He didn't care about the actual amount but only about the imagined affront. I once suggested that he and I order what the other actually wanted and, when the food was served, exchange plates. After we had done so, <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head in disbelief, still thinking that he had received the smaller portion.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} museum chair, Marcus was once called upon by Fred Florence, then {{chairman}} of a major local bank and a fellow Temple Emanu-El leader, to explain his inclusion of [...] "a lot of Communist art" [...] he'd been told would be included in an upcoming DMFA [...] "Sports in Art" [...] exhibit, co-sponsored by Sports Illustrated and United States Information Agency as a fund-raiser for the 1956 Olympic team. Artists represented in the show included four supposed Communist supporters, Leon Kroll, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Ben Shahn, and William Zorach. Asking Florence to indicate which pieces were being questioned, Marcus dismissed each claim one by one: [...] "I don't know how anybody could think hitting a baseball was communist," [...] Marcus said when shown Shahn's [...] "The National Pastime." [...] His response to Zorach's [...] "Fisherman" [...] was similar, as <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> head and remarked, [...] "I don't think too many people think fishing is communist either." [...] Marcus followed up by going to local newspapers The Dallas Morning News and the Dallas Times-Herald and getting the publishers of both to agree {{that they would not}} stand for censorship in the arts.|$|E
500|$|Meanwhile, Jack learns from NBC page Kenneth Parcell (Jack McBrayer) {{that he has}} bedbugs. As {{a result}} of being ostracized due to his condition, and now feeling compassionate, Jack tells Liz to give {{everyone}} a chance to audition, after catching her {{trying to get rid of}} people trying out. During the audition process, Jack, Liz, and Pete witness auditions from TGS staff writers Frank Rossitano (Judah Friedlander), James [...] "Toofer" [...] Spurlock (Keith Powell), J.D. Lutz (John Lutz), NBC news anchor Brian Williams, Kathy Geiss (Marceline Hugot), the daughter of General Electric (GE) CEO Don Geiss (Rip Torn), [...] "Dot Com" [...] Slattery (Kevin Brown), former TGS cast member Josh Girard (Lonny Ross), and a robot street performer (Daniel Genalo). During Jayden's audition, Liz realizes that Jayden's supposed references—Gilbert Godfried, Martin Scorsese, and Christopher Walken—were not legit and that Jayden impersonated them. She confronts him about this, however, Jayden plans to blackmail Liz with a camera marked by her fingerprints—that features provocative photos of Jayden, to make it look like Liz would only hire him if he would let her take pictures of his genitals. Liz tries to stop Jack from casting Jayden, though Jack has made up his mind in hiring the robot street performer. Jack casts him after <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> hand without being concerned that Jack had bedbugs.|$|E

2500|$|Presley {{was even}} {{seen as a}} [...] "definite danger to the {{security}} of the United States." [...] His actions and motions were called [...] "a strip-tease with clothes on" [...] or [...] "sexual self-gratification on stage." [...] They were compared with [...] "masturbation or riding a microphone." [...] Some saw the singer as a sexual pervert, and psychologists feared that teenage girls and boys could easily be [...] "aroused to sexual indulgence and perversion by certain types of motions and hysteria,—the type that was exhibited at the Presley show." [...] In August 1956 in Jacksonville, Florida a local Juvenile Court judge called Presley a [...] "savage" [...] and threatened to arrest him if <b>he</b> <b>shook</b> <b>his</b> body while performing at Jacksonville's Florida Theatre, justifying the restrictions by saying his music was undermining the youth of America. Throughout the performance, Presley stood still as ordered but poked fun at the judge by wiggling a finger. Similar attempts to stop his [...] "sinful gyrations" [...] continued {{for more than a year}} and included his often-noted January 6, 1957 appearance on The Ed Sullivan Show (during which he performed the spiritual number [...] "Peace in the Valley"), when he was filmed only from the waist up.|$|E
