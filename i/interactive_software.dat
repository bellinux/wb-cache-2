The series debuted in Japan on August 9, 1996 with , which later {{was released in}} the North American and PAL regions as Harvest Moon. Story of Seasons {{is a series of}} farm simulation/role-playing video games where the main objective is to maintain a farm over a period of time, tending the crops and livestock throughout the seasons, while befriending the nearby townsfolk and getting married in some games. Story of Seasons titles have been released on numerous different video game consoles and handheld game consoles. Several titles have been re-released on multiple platforms as special editions which include an updated gameplay. Fourteen spin-off titles have been released, featuring related elements. One of these titles, , was released to mark the 10th anniversary of the Story of Seasons series.

Subsequent cuts and corporate policies led Sid Meier, Jeff Briggs and Brian Reynolds leaving and forming Firaxis Games in 1996, as MicroProse closed its ex-Simtex development studio in Austin, Texas. In 1998, following an unsuccessful buyout attempt by GT <b>Interactive</b> <b>Software,</b> the struggling MicroProse (Spectrum HoloByte) became a wholly owned subsidiary of Hasbro Interactive and its development studios in Alameda, California and Chapel Hill, North Carolina were closed the following year. In 2001, MicroProse ceased to exist as an entity and Hasbro Interactive sold the MicroProse intellectual properties to Infogrames Entertainment, SA.

Then in 1998, Cendant sold off their entire <b>interactive</b> <b>software</b> branch for $1 billion to Havas Interactive, a subsidiary of Vivendi Universal. At that point, the adventure game market was starting to wane as other types of genres became more popular, partially enabled by more powerful home console hardware such as the PlayStation. Sierra exited the game development sector, and was rebranded as Sierra Entertainment to help with video game publishing. They would continue to publish titles through 2008; at that time, Vivendi has been acquired by Activision, who shut down Sierra though kept the name.

500|$|Flower, Sun, and Rain was {{originally}} {{going to be}} published by ASCII Entertainment, the publishers for The Silver Case. Policy changes at ASCII meant that the whole project was in danger of being cancelled as they would no longer support the game. Suda ended up pitching to other publishing houses, eventually gaining the support of Victor <b>Interactive</b> <b>Software.</b> This approach of pitching to new publishers with each title would be adopted by the developer for multiple subsequent titles to protect their status as an independent studio. It was during this period that he met Yasuhiro Wada, with whom he collaborated on future projects for Grasshopper Manufacture. The change of publisher, along with its release date, was publicly announced in February 2001. Over the following months, the game was featured in multiple Japanese magazines, and was exhibited at that year's first Tokyo Game Show. The game's opening used a mixture of live-action and in-game footage; the live action footage featured actress and model Mia Murano. In addition to its Japanese title, the game's title was translated into English, giving rise to its common acronym [...] "FSR". Flower, Sun, and Rain was released on May 2, 2001. The PS2 version was not released outside Japan. It was speculated that this was due to the game's content mirroring recent terrorist attacks.|$|E

2500|$|Suda's {{next game}} at Grasshopper Manufacture was Flower, Sun, and Rain, {{developed}} for the PlayStation 2. As with The Silver Case, Suda directed, wrote and designed for the game.

2500|$|General {{manager of}} Lucas Learning Susan Schilling said that Droidworks {{did not require}} the player to use bombs or guns to progress, noting that the only weapon {{required}} is the player's mind.

Susan Schilling and [...] senior director of worldwide developer relations at Apple Computer Clent Richardson agreed that the Apple Mac was the best platform to play the game on.

2500|$|Vortex vice {{president}} Rick Giolito {{noted that there}} was [...] "pressure" [...] by their clients [...] "to incorporate Hollywood-type production, techniques, and corporate structure." [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook agreed that Creative Wonders had streamlined its production process and produced partnerships and alliances between previously unrelated companies {{in a similar fashion}} to the [...] "'best practices' of Hollywood". Giolito asserted that publishers forced the company to create prototypes for pre-testing by focus groups before products would receive complete funding, investment, or a purchase commitment, which lead to shoe-horned Madeline prototypes that were made on a bootstrap budget. [...] Interactive Publisher's Handbook wrote that the developer was required to have a [...] "lean production" [...] in order to ensure success of the multi-company entity. EA required the developer to create technical design documents which would state the project milestones based on required technical aspects like game engines that need proof of concept, how long each element would take, the amount of human resources invested which then determined the shipping date; according to executive producer Michael Pole this was a favourable alternative to choosing a release date then working backwards and it helped developers stick to a timeline and understand which assets they were able to deliver. The publisher wanted the prototype stage to be preliminary deadline, with a trivial monitary investment that would identify any [...] "technical hurdles" [...] early on; this was followed by [...] "delivery of levels and game tuning" [...] by the developer. They would only back a project once [...] "one room of an environment that includes art and animation up and running, some collision detection and some gameplay" [...] was created, thereby demonstrating a viable investment; the preliminary artwork and prototype had to be completed within four months. The outsourcing of development to Vortex was a cost-cutting measure, as [...] "software publishers ha found that they mae more money distributing and selling software than developing it"; this led to a [...] "garage developer phenomenon" [...] where companies like Vortex made games like Madeline out of houses and basements. Madeline game artists worked double shifts, and shared computers, desks, and phone lines. In terms of marketing, EA would start devising strategy early on by discussing the chosen genre, and making sure the content and design fit the genre and were [...] "demographically correct"; for instance Pole asserted that [...] "Madeline doesn't belong on the Sony Playstation". In addition to Madaline already being a recognisable brand through its 60-year history, many national sales representatives in the <b>interactive</b> <b>software</b> industry had previously worked in the book and toy space, which meant that they were especially familiar with elements of the Madeline franchise. Madeline and the Magnificent Puppet Show, Madeline Thinking Games, and Madeline European Adventures were published by Creative Wonders in 1995–6, and Madeline would become Creative Wonders' [...] "flagship product". Interactive Publisher's Handbook believes that the marketing of the games would have been in vain if the games didn't live up to the expectations of Madeline branded content, and noted that its financial success paid off for DIC's original gamble, and that the critical praise of the premiere title coupled with ABC's desire to run children's programming led to the network picking up the second season of DIC's animated version of Madeline and airing it under the title The New Adventures of Madeline (the previous season and specials had aired on the Family Channel).|$|E
