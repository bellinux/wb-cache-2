Here, we investigate the thermal stability of the surface passivation by amorphous silicon nitride double layers (SiNy/SiNx). The SiNy passivation layer is silicon rich with refractive index larger than 3. Whereas the SiNx capping layer has a refractive index of 2. 05.

Specifically the aims are set at flame stability and pollutions. Important part of this paper is a novel design procedure dealing with premixed burners. Further, by exploiting the results of testing program enabled one to design burners exhibiting low level of nitrogen oxides emissions. On the basis of aerodynamic analysis of premixed burners flow path several recommendations on the geometry resulted in proposing two ejectors, which transport the combustion air. In the first ejector the fuel jet, generated by flow through a nozzle, draws the specified part of the combustion air, and then the mixture is a driving agent of the second ejector. The remaining part of combustion air flows first through the radial curved vanes, and second its tangential velocity component is augmented by axial vanes prior it enters mixing part of the second ejector. For the additional contribution to the rotating motion the inclined axial vanes built inside the nozzle of the second ejector are responsible. The resulting swirling number reaches the values up to 2. 6. For the burner so arranged <b>fire</b> <b>stability</b> and low NOx emissions in the wide operating conditions can be expected. Within the frame of extensive testing program in the field of diffusion burners several modifications have been carried out such as setting of axial vanes which secure the swirling motion, changes of combustion air flows path, and modifications of secondary nozzles, these resulted in extending zone of stabilized flame and reducing the formation of NOx, e. g.

The passivation was virtually independent of the SiO 2 thickness and showed an exceptional <b>firing</b> <b>stability.</b> C–V measurements revealed that the SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 stacks yielded {{a high level of}} chemical passivation after alnealing due to a low interface defect density. Preliminary results using an alternative method to synthesize the low-temperature SiO 2 films, and (similar) results for thermally grown SiO 2 [30], have suggested that the effective hydrogenation under influence of the Al 2 O 3 capping film may be general. Moreover, preliminary data on the long-term stability showed a low Seff (< 4  cm/s) for a stack measured after 250  days. The excellent efficiency values (up to 21.3 – 21.5  %), the high voltages (680  mV), the excellent long-wavelength quantum efficiency, and the high short-circuit currents of these cells (40  mA/cm 2) are a proof for the low rear-SRV and excellent internal rear-surface reflection [31]. Moreover, Al 2 O 3 passivation overcomes the so-called ‘parasitic shunting’ effects which is very common for SiN x [...] passivated rear [32]. Low-temperature-synthesized SiO 2 /Al 2 O 3 passivation schemes can provide a realistic alternative for thermally grown SiO 2 in next-generation solar cells.|$|R

Recently, extremely short intervals have been identified as a threatening process for the ongoing persistence of species in a number of vegetation types. A variety of methods were used to determine a minimum fire-return interval suitable for the maintenance of biodiversity in the species-rich and fire-prone northern sandplain shrublands of Western Australia. Several species considered vulnerable to high fire frequency were selected for demographic analysis with space-for-time substitution used to determine key life-history attributes such as time to produce adequate seed for self-replacement. Community-level resilience was captured using pre- and post-fire plot comparisons in recently burnt vegetation that was re-burnt by experimental <b>fires.</b> The <b>stability</b> of each site was measured in terms of resemblance to pre-fire composition at 12 months after fire. The effect of post-fire rainfall on seedling mortality was also examined as a factor independent of fire interval length. The results were combined to identify a minimum return interval that has provided land managers with a sound ecological basis for determining an appropriate prescribed burning regime for the community...|$|R
