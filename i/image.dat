25|$|In HTML and XHTML, an <b>image</b> map {{is a list}} of {{coordinates}} {{relating to}} a specific <b>image,</b> created in order to hyperlink areas of the <b>image</b> to different destinations (as opposed to a normal <b>image</b> link, in which the entire area of the <b>image</b> links to a single destination). For example, a map of the world may have each country hyperlinked to further information about that country. The intention of an <b>image</b> map is to provide an easy way of linking various parts of an <b>image</b> without dividing the <b>image</b> into separate <b>image</b> files.|$|E
25|$|If the {{original}} <b>image</b> is enlarged {{to make the}} final <b>image,</b> the circle of confusion in {{the original}} <b>image</b> must be smaller than that in the final <b>image</b> by the ratio of enlargement. Cropping an <b>image</b> and enlarging to the same size final <b>image</b> as an uncropped <b>image</b> taken under the same conditions is equivalent to using a smaller format under the same conditions, so the cropped <b>image</b> has less DOF.

25|$|<b>Image</b> {{rejection}} is {{an important}} factor in choosing the intermediate frequency of a receiver. The farther apart the bandpass frequency and the <b>image</b> frequency are, the more the bandpass filter will attenuate any interfering <b>image</b> signal. Since the frequency separation between the bandpass and the <b>image</b> frequency is , a higher intermediate frequency improves <b>image</b> rejection.

25|$|To {{render a}} full-color <b>image</b> as a GIF, the {{original}} <b>image</b> must {{be broken down}} into smaller regions having no more than 255 or 256 different colors. Each of these regions is then stored as a separate <b>image</b> block with its own local palette and when the <b>image</b> blocks are displayed together (either by tiling or by layering partially transparent <b>image</b> blocks) the complete, full-color <b>image</b> appears. For example, breaking an <b>image</b> into tiles of 16 by 16 pixels (256 pixels in total) ensures that no tile has more than the local palette limit of 256 colors, although larger tiles may be used and similar colors merged resulting in some loss of color information.|$|E

30|$|<b>Images</b> from {{publicly}} available databases {{were used to}} test the properties of the registration implemented using AJM as similarity measure. The test set was constructed so as to have as much diversity as possible. First, we used all 44 miscellaneous <b>images</b> from the SIPI database [29]. Since this database does not have medical <b>images,</b> all 19 medical <b>images</b> from the VIS database [30] were added to the set as well as 3 mammography <b>images</b> from the MIAS database [31]. From the MIAS set, only three <b>images</b> were selected since the variability of the <b>images</b> from this set is low. Finally, 34 <b>images</b> of different objects from the ALOI database [32] were added to the set which made the total number of <b>images</b> in the testing set 100. The set constructed in this way contained <b>images</b> with different context, from natural to artificially constructed <b>images.</b> Both colour and greyscale <b>images</b> were represented in this set, but all <b>images</b> were converted to greyscale before the registration. All the <b>images</b> were coded with either 7 or 8 bits per pixel and the resolution of <b>images</b> ranged from 128 × 128 to 1, 024 × 1, 024.

25|$|Gaussian {{blurring}} {{is commonly}} used when reducing {{the size of an}} <b>image.</b> When downsampling an <b>image,</b> it is common to apply a low-pass filter to the <b>image</b> prior to resampling.
