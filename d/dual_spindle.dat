40|$|In today’s industry, the {{competitive}} market, the short life {{time of the}} products and rapid change in customer demand forms a big trend of appearance of new manufacturing system. Reconfigurable Machine Tool (RMT) {{is a kind of}} solution for future machining systems, thus it can not only provide customized solutions to the operation requirements but also is cost-effective. Thethesis aims to create and implement methodology of RMT design for manufacturing industry. The methodology is introduced and extended according to the five principals of modular machine tool design. The methodology will be applied step by step herein so as to make the methodology more clear. First of all is to get the concept or process requirements from the customer. The customer requires three reconfigurable part families for a high speed milling application including tables, spindles, and cutters. In this case, to fulfill customer’s requirements and concept, the <b>dual</b> <b>spindle</b> (Multi-tool) RMT is selected as an example to interpret the RMT design methodology. Secondly, the most important point in methodology of RMT design is to analyze the valuable proposal of the four principles of modular design based on extensive experience. This work turns the four principles, separation, and unification (standardization), connection, and adaptation, to practical design methodology. Based on the classical four principles, the principle of reusability is an addition principal in consider of zero waste concept. In order to perform the RMT design methodology effectively, it is necessary to complement the advantages of the reconfiguration in <b>dual</b> <b>spindle</b> RMT design and the reconfiguration for other part families in according to the RMT design methodology. A final step utilizes computer software to model the configuration in 3 dimensions. And evaluations can be discussed in Degree of Freedom (DOF), stiffness analysis and number of modules...|$|E
40|$|Roughly {{half of all}} animal {{somatic cell}} {{spindles}} assemble by the classical prophase pathway, in which the centrosomes separate ahead of nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). The remainder assemble by the prometaphase pathway, in which the centrosomes separate following NEBD. Why cells use <b>dual</b> pathway <b>spindle</b> assembly is unclear. Here, by examining the timing of NEBD relative to the onset of Eg 5 -mEGFP loading to centrosomes, we show that a time window of 9. 2 ± 2. 9 min is available for Eg 5 -driven prophase centrosome separation ahead of NEBD, and that those cells that succeed in separating their centrosomes within this window subsequently show. 3 -fold fewer chromosome segregation errors and a somewhat faster mitosis. A longer time window would allow more cells to complete prophase centrosome separation and further reduce segregation errors, but {{at the expense of}} a slower mitosis. Our data reveal dual pathway mitosis in a new light, as a substantive strategy that increases both the speed and the fidelity of mitosis...|$|R
40|$|In {{eucaryotic}} cells, {{duplication of}} spindle poles must be coordinated with other cell cycle functions. We report here the identification in Saccharomyces cerevisiae of a temperature-sensitive lethal mutation, esp 1, that deregulates spindle pole duplication. Mutant cells {{transferred to the}} nonpermissive temperature became unable to continue DNA synthesis and cell division but displayed repeated duplication of their spindle pole bodies. Although entry into this state after transient challenge by the nonpermissive temperature was largely lethal, rare survivors were recovered and found to have become increased in ploidy. If the mutant cells were held in G 0 or G 1 during exposure to the elevated temperature, they remained viable and maintained normal numbers of spindle poles. These results suggest <b>dual</b> regulation of <b>spindle</b> pole duplication, including a mechanism that promotes duplication as cells enter the division cycle and a negative regulatory mechanism, controlled by ESP 1, that limits duplication to a single occurrence in each cell division cycle. Tetrad analysis has revealed that ESP 1 resides at a previously undescribed locus on the right arm of chromosome VII...|$|R
