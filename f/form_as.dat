5|$|Tropical {{cyclones}} <b>form</b> <b>as</b> {{a result}} of significant convective activity, and are warm core. Mesocyclones <b>form</b> <b>as</b> warm core cyclones over land, {{and can lead to}} tornado formation. Waterspouts can also form from mesocyclones, but more often develop from environments of high instability and low vertical wind shear. Cyclolysis is the opposite of cyclogenesis, and is the high-pressure system equivalent, which deals with the formation of high-pressure areas—Anticyclogenesis.|$|E

5|$|Andesite at Slag Hill {{consists}} of 70% dark brown volcanic glass with varied degrees of trachytic texture in the plagioclastic matrix {{and less than}} 5% of the andesite comprises vesicular textures. Plagioclase, hornblende and augite are mostly in <b>form</b> <b>as</b> phenocrysts and comprise 1% to 10% of the andesite. Orthoclase crystals are found occasionally and they likely represent xenocrysts.|$|E
40|$|First, {{the carbon}} content {{decreases}} {{with the increasing}} of silicon content in silicon phases. Second, the carbon content has no obvious trend in ferrosilicon phases. Third, the carbon element can be <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> silicon carbide in all locations in ferrosilicon furnace. Fourth, the carbon content inside the silicon and ferrosilicon phases in the location where is near the outer wall is higher than elsewhere. From the analysis, most of the silicon carbide phases are <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> big particles in the samples. However, silicon carbide phase is <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> small particles in this location. Fifth, silicon and iron can be <b>formed</b> <b>as</b> {{a variety of different}} ferrosilicon compounds in ferrosilicon furnace. </p...|$|R

5|$|Because of its {{significance}} for planetary cores, the physical properties of iron at high pressures and temperatures {{have also been}} studied extensively.

5|$|In 1972, the Swiss {{architect}} and then-Jesuit priest Hans Roth began an extensive restoration {{project of the}} missionary churches and many colonial buildings that were in ruins.

The restoration works have continued sporadically into the beginning of the 21st century under local leadership.|$|E
5|$|In May 2016, several {{injuries}} in the Italian squad, {{as well as a}} lack of attacking options and Totti's run of good <b>form</b> <b>as</b> a substitute for Roma, led some in the media to call for manager Antonio Conte to include Totti as a reserve in Italy's Euro 2016 squad; however, he was later left out of Conte's 30-man preliminary Italy squad for the final tournament.|$|E

5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to <b>form</b> <b>as</b> {{the result of a}} collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a protostar forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
