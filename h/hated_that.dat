The pair {{were asked if}} they would ever consider writing an episode with a happy ending. Shearsmith responded by saying [...] "Yes, because that would be the biggest surprise of all ... But last year we had the Last Gasp, and that had quite a happy ending - and people <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> one!"

500|$|Upon {{the end of}} the Beatles' {{performing}} career, McCartney sensed unease in {{the band}} and wanted them to maintain creative productivity. He pressed them to start a new project, which became Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band, widely regarded as rock's first concept album. McCartney was inspired to create a new persona for the group, to serve as a vehicle for experimentation and to demonstrate to their fans that they had musically matured. He invented the fictional band of the album's title track. As McCartney explained, [...] "We were fed up with being the Beatles. We really <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> fucking four little mop-top approach. We were not boys we were men... and [...] thought of ourselves as artists rather than just performers." ...|$|E
500|$|That {{performance}} {{continued with}} [...] "It's All Coming Back to Me Now", which was widely praised. Dodge said that it, like the prior song, was [...] "covered to perfection".

An [...] "A" [...] was not sufficient for Slezak, who declared that it was [...] "one of Glee's five best vocals ever" [...] and gave it an [...] "A+". Futterman [...] "loved" [...] the song except for its ending, which she described as [...] "an abrupt cliffhanger".|$|E
500|$|The album's title Meddle is {{a play on}} words: a medal, and to interfere. [...] Storm Thorgerson of the art-design group Hipgnosis {{originally}} {{suggested a}} close-up shot of a baboon's anus for the album cover photograph. [...] He was overruled by the band, who informed him via an intercontinental telephone call while on tour in Japan that they would rather have [...] "an ear underwater". [...] The cover image was photographed by Bob Dowling. [...] The image represents an ear, underwater, collecting waves of sound (represented by ripples in the water). Thorgerson has expressed dissatisfaction with the cover, claiming it to be his least favourite Pink Floyd album sleeve: [...] "I think Meddle {{is a much better}} album than its cover". Thorgerson's colleague Aubrey Powell shares his sentiments, saying: [...] "Meddle was a mess. [...] I <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> cover. [...] I don't think we did them justice with that at all; it's half-hearted." [...] The gatefold contains a group photograph of the band (Floyd's last until 1987's A Momentary Lapse of Reason).|$|E

500|$|With {{the success}} of albums by Hill, Badu, and Maxwell, D'Angelo's second album Voodoo served as a further {{alternative}} to excesses of late 1990s R and hip hop, as neo soul reached its apex in 2000. A production of the Soulquarians, it was an exemplary creative milestone of neo soul. Ben Ratliff of The New York Times called the album [...] "the succes d'estime that proves the force of this new music: it is a largely unslick, stubbornly idiosyncratic and genuinely great album that has already produced two hit singles". By {{the time of her}} second album Mama's Gun (2000), Erykah Badu had been dubbed by writers as [...] "the queen of neo-soul". She said of the honorific title, [...] "I <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> because what if I don’t do that anymore? What if I change? Then that puts me in a penitentiary." [...] Subsequently, other artists attained success in the early 2000s, including Bilal, Musiq Soulchild, India.Arie, and Alicia Keys, who broke through to broader popularity with her debut album Songs in A Minor (2001). Hip hop artists such as The Roots and Common, associated with the Soulquarians, released albums that incorporated neo soul, Phrenology (2002) and Electric Circus (2003).|$|E
500|$|The South Park {{football}} team plays a rival team from Middle Park, Colorado. Like South Park itself, Middle Park is an actual basin in the Rocky Mountains of north-central Colorado. Matt Stone said the Middle Park kids {{were made to}} seem richer and cooler than the South Park students {{because that was the}} perception real South Park residents have of the actual Middle Park. Richard Stamos, who sings during halftime in the episode's football game, is the fictional brother of John Stamos, a real-life actor best known for his roles on Full House and ER. Trey Parker and Matt Stone did not know Stamos when they wrote [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride", but Parker said they assumed he was [...] "a big douche" [...] because of his role on Full House, which Parker called [...] "just the most horrible thing ever put on television". Since the episode aired, however, Parker and Stone have become acquainted with Stamos and found him to be [...] "a really, really cool guy". John Stamos told them he loved the inclusion of the Richard Stamos character in [...] "Big Gay Al's Big Gay Boat Ride". Richard Stamos sings [...] "Lovin' You", a 1975 hit single by singer-songwriter Minnie Riperton. Parker chose it because he felt it was a popular song in the gay community, and also because, [...] "I've just always <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> song. I hate any song from that era, really. It's just a horrible time for music." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1977, de Lucía married Casilda Varela, the {{daughter}} of General Varela; they had three children. He released his final album, Castillo de Arena with Camarón de la Isla, The lyrics were written by Antonio Sánchez, {{with the exception of}} the bulerías Samara, which Sánchez and de la Isla wrote together. This would be his last LP with a singer for at least 15 years. He reportedly said that the human voice is [...] "naturally too limited" [...] and that he prefers the exploration of different instrumentalists; he also said a busy schedule was the reason for lack of recordings with singers. He performed extensively across the US and Europe during this period, increasing his popularity outside Spain and the flamenco community in Europe, and met many jazz, Latin and other musicians who continued to influence de Lucía's evolution as a [...] "Nuevo flamenco" [...] player. He began to show a very keen interest in jazz fusion and rock, and in 1977 performed with Carlos Santana in the Plaza de toros de las Arenas bullring in Barcelona. He was invited by Al Di Meola to record on his [...] "Mediterranean Sundance" [...] piece for his album Elegant Gypsy. Despite considerable new interest in flamenco and de Lucía's playing generated by the album, traditionalist flamenco critics did not approve of the piece and <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> many people considered Mediterranean Sundance flamenco music and frowned upon de Lucía. Di Meola informed the critics not to worry and that [...] "Paco is not leaving flamenco, but expanding it." [...] In 1978, Paco and his brothers recorded Interpreta a Manuel de Falla, a classical effort of compositions by Manuel de Falla.|$|E

500|$|For {{the first}} series, {{interior}} sets were {{built at the}} Blue Shed Studios in Salford. Three directors and three film crews were used to film the six 50-minute episodes over 14 weeks from March to May 1998. Locations included an empty shop unit near Piccadilly station for the charity shop sex scene in Episode 3 and a Masonic Lodge for the gala dinner scenes in Episode 6. In the second year, the sets were moved to the Spectrum Arena in Warrington, where filming ran from March to June. The series featured the first location shoots outside Manchester; a short scene in Episode 2 featuring Bathurst was filmed over half a day in Blackpool; Bathurst, Norris and a small production crew filmed scenes in Paris for Episode 3; exterior location scenes of the characters on holiday in Episode 6 were filmed on Lindisfarne, though the castle interiors were shot at Hoghton Tower. The second series also featured more visual effects; in Episode 5 Adam dreams about being chased by a giant testicle (which was computer-generated) and in Episode 6 a fireworks explosion was supervised by pyrotechnics experts. The testicle dream scene drew mixed reaction. The Mirrors television critic Charlie Catchpole praised it but Robert Bathurst was critical: [...] "I <b>hated</b> <b>that</b> sequence. I thought it was really unfunny. It was a lousy prop and awful graphics and {{there was too much}} of it—it would have been much better if it was like a Monty Python foot come smacking down like that and get it over with. You couldn't keep up that surprise and hilarity for all the minutes it was on the screen." [...] By the third series, Cold Feets sets were permanently located on a Granada warehouse stage and were left intact between series. This meant the basic sets could be used on other Granada programmes, such as The Grimleys and My Beautiful Son. After the final episode was filmed in 2002, the sets were dismantled and taken to a landfill.|$|E

2500|$|In June 1987, Marr {{left the}} group, and auditions {{to find a}} {{replacement}} for him proved fruitless. By the time Strangeways, Here We Come (named after Strangeways Prison, Manchester) was released in September, the band had split up. The breakdown in the relationship has been primarily attributed to Morrissey's becoming annoyed by Marr's work with other artists and Marr's growing frustration with Morrissey's musical inflexibility. Referring to the songs recorded in the band's last session together (B-sides for the [...] "Girlfriend in a Coma" [...] single, which preceded the album's release), Marr said [...] "I wrote 'I Keep Mine Hidden', but 'Work Is a Four-Letter Word' I <b>hated.</b> <b>That</b> was the last straw, really. I didn't form a group to perform Cilla Black songs." [...] In 1989, {{in an interview with}} young fan Tim Samuels (who later became a BBC journalist), Morrissey claimed the lack of a managerial figure and business problems were to blame for the band's eventual split. In a 2016 interview, Marr agreed with this.|$|E

[...] The song was released in Japan as part of the EP Live from the Jungle, which also featured a selection of live recordings from the band's June 1987 dates at London's The Marquee, the group's first shows outside the United States. The song is the highest charting Guns N' Roses song, and is the band's only song to reach number one on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E
