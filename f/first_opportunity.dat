5|$|With the Eagles, Bell {{led the way}} in {{cooperating}} with the other NFL owners to establish the National Football League Draft in order to afford the weakest teams the <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sign the best available players. He subsequently became sole proprietor of the Eagles, but the franchise suffered financially. Eventually, he sold the team and bought a share in the Pittsburgh Steelers. During World War II, Bell astutely argued against the league suspending operations until the war's conclusion.|$|E
5|$|As {{the crew}} {{worked through the}} {{procedures}} and checklists for entry on Friday, the managers on the ground closely examined the weather patterns around Florida, which were less than favorable. The crew was advised that there were low clouds and thunderstorms, both conditions that violated landing criteria, so managers waived the <b>first</b> <b>opportunity.</b> A second opportunity was also not taken, as the weather had not improved. Entry Flight Director Norm Knight called up Edwards Air Force Base shortly after the decision to delay to Saturday was made, which would give the crew {{a total of six}} Saturday landing opportunities, three at each location.|$|E
5|$|Gay {{chose to}} study {{sociology}} and marketing, {{and the university}} environment gave the 22-year-old sprinter his <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to compete in NCAA events. In the NCAA Men's Indoor Track and Field Championship in March, Gay finished fourth in the 60 meters, with 6.63s, and fifth in the closely fought 200m {{with a time of}} 20.58s (he missed out on second place by only two hundredths of a second). The NCAA Men's Outdoor Track and Field Championship in June proved far more fruitful, however, as Gay became Arkansas' first 100m NCAA champion, setting a school record of 10.06s. Furthermore, his efforts in the event helped the Arkansas athletic team win the NCAA Championship.|$|E

5|$|In 1892, Berkman, Goldman, and Aronstam {{relocated}} to Worcester, Massachusetts, where they operated a successful luncheonette. At {{the end of}} June, Goldman saw a newspaper headline that brought to her attention the trio's <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for political action: the Homestead Strike. In June 1892, workers at a steel plant in Homestead, Pennsylvania were locked out when negotiations between the Carnegie Steel Company and the Amalgamated Association of Iron and Steel Workers failed. Henry Clay Frick, the factory's notoriously anti-union manager, hired 300 armed guards from the Pinkerton Detective Agency to break the union's picket lines. When the Pinkerton guards arrived at the factory {{on the morning of}} July6, a gunfight broke out. Nine union workers and seven guards were killed in the 12-hour fight.|$|E
5|$|In 2001, she co-starred with Lisa Dergan in The Arena, a Roger Corman-produced, direct-to-video movie {{directed}} by Timur Bekmambetov. The entire production {{was shot in}} Russia. In her feature film debut, McDougal's character, Jessemina, is a slave girl who is forced into fighting as a female gladiator in an Ancient Roman colony by its corrupt governor. The role offered McDougal her <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> {{to act in a}} dramatic role and to demonstrate her physical abilities with the movie's sword fighting sequences. The movie, initially titled Gladiatrix was deemed to be a knockoff of Gladiator. Although the movie was not well received, it has turned into a lesser known cult film.|$|E
5|$|Near {{the start}} of the second half in extra time, Galatasaray's <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> came, when Şükür {{attempted}} a shot from a Popescu cross, but the ball hit the side netting. After seven minutes, Kanu beat a defender, dribbled into the Galatasaray area and shot the ball twice, only to be denied twice by Taffarel. In the dying minutes both teams continued to create decisive chances – Galatasaray's Popescu was given a free–kick, after Şükür was brought down by Keown. However, the ball flew straight into Seaman's arms. Arsenal's Sylvinho put in a cross into the Galatasaray area to Henry, but ball was cleared away. The final whistle was blown and the match moved into a penalty shoot-out.|$|E

At Survivor Series, they both were a part of Team D-Generation X, which gained the victory over Team Rated-RKO with a clean sweep. The {{brothers}} then received their <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> since Hardy's return to win a tag team championship at Armageddon. They competed in a four-team ladder match for the WWE Tag Team Championship, but they came up short in their attempt. In the course of the match, however, they inadvertently legitimately injured Joey Mercury's face.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantis {{crew had}} two Florida return {{opportunities}} for the day, {{as well as two}} for a California landing, giving the managers time to evaluate the weather and use California if necessary. After choosing to pass on the <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for KSC and evaluate the second, managers on the ground decided that the weather in Florida was too dynamic to risk bringing the orbiter in, and opted to land at Edwards Air Force Base instead. The de-orbit burn was initiated at 14:24 UTC, a burn of the shuttle's engines that brought it out of orbit to begin the orbiter's reentry into the Earth's atmosphere. Atlantis successfully landed at Edwards Air Force Base on Runway 22 at 8:39am PDT after 197 orbits in space and a distance of approximately 5.2million miles.|$|E
5|$|The {{new owners}} faced a chaotic situation. The team had few players under contract, {{and had made}} little effort to sign any of their draft picks, most of which had signed with the NFL. The league {{attempted}} to strengthen the Jets and the woeful Oakland Raiders {{by allowing them to}} select players from the other six teams, and by giving them the <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to sign players cut from NFL rosters. Ewbank, who had discovered Colts great Johnny Unitas at an open tryout, held tryouts for the Jets. Only seven of the participants were invited to training camp, and one, Marshall Starks, made the team as a second-teamer. In mid-July, it was announced that the Jets could not move into Shea Stadium until 1964.|$|E

5|$|Washington's {{introduction}} to surveying began {{at an early}} age through school exercises that taught him the basics of the profession, followed by practical experience in the field. His first experiences at surveying occurred in the territory surrounding Mount Vernon. His <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> as a surveyor occurred in 1748 when he was invited to join a survey party organized by his neighbor and friend George Fairfax of Belvoir. Fairfax organized a professional surveying party to lay out large tracts of land along the border of western Virginia, where the young Washington gained invaluable experience in the field.|$|E
5|$|With the {{continuation}} of the war in South Africa, a number of regiments containing large centres of population formed additional regular battalions. The King's (Liverpool Regiment) formed 3rd and 4th regular Battalions in February 1900, when the militia battalions were relabeled as the 5th and 6th battalions. The Boer War also provided the <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> for the regiment's volunteer battalions to serve overseas with regular forces, supplying individual detachments and service companies. The militia battalions, numbered the 5th and 6th during the war, contrastingly deployed to South Africa intact late in the conflict. A memorial sculpted by William Goscombe John to commemorate the regiment's service in Afghanistan, Burma, and South Africa was erected in St John's Gardens, Liverpool and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on 9 September 1905.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Szabó {{wanted to}} be a doctor like his father. By the age of 16, however, he had been {{inspired}} by a book by Hungarian film theorist Béla Balázs to become a film director. Upon graduation from high school, he became one of 11 applicants out of 800 who were admitted to the Academy of Theatrical and Cinematic Arts. At the Academy, he studied with the famous director Félix Máriássy, who became something of a father figure to Szabó. Among his classmates were Judit Elek, Zsolt Kézdi-Kovács, Janos Rozsa, Pál Gábor, Imre Gyöngyössy, Ferenc Kardos, and Zoltán Huszárik. While at the Academy, Szabó directed several short films, culminating in his thesis film, Koncert (1963), which won a prize at the International Short Film Festival Oberhausen. Thanks to János Herskó, head of the Hunnia Film Studio at which he apprenticed, Szabó was given his <b>first</b> <b>opportunity</b> to direct a feature film at the age of 25, rather than being required to spend ten years working as an assistant director.|$|E
