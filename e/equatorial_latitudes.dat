25|$|In October 2008, the Ecuadorian Space Agency {{published}} a report called HIPERION, {{a study of}} the last 28 years data from 10 satellites and dozens of ground instruments around the world among them their own, and found that the UV radiation reaching <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitudes</b> was far greater than expected, with the UV Index climbing as high as 24 in some very populated cities; the WHO considers 11 as an extreme index and a great risk to health. The report concluded that depleted ozone levels around the mid-latitudes of the planet are already endangering large populations in these areas. Later, the CONIDA, the Peruvian Space Agency, published its own study, which yielded almost the same findings as the Ecuadorian study.|$|E

Early in the Ordovician the continents Laurentia, Siberia and Baltica were still independent continents (since the break-up of the supercontinent Pannotia earlier), but Baltica began to move toward Laurentia later in the period, causing the Iapetus Ocean to shrink between them. Also, Avalonia broke free from Gondwana and began to head north toward Laurentia. The Rheic Ocean was formed {{as a result of}} this. By the end of the period, Gondwana had neared or approached the pole and was largely glaciated.|$|E

30|$|Daily, hourly and {{monthly median}} data of TEC and foF 2 are {{obtained}} from Chumphon station, Thailand, {{located near the}} magnetic equator during 2004 – 2006. Those data are used for deriving and analyzing the diurnal, monthly, and seasonal variations of the slab thickness. Our study finds that slab thickness at Chumphon located near the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> is much larger than those found at the low, mid, and high latitudes. The seasonal variations show that the greatest average slab thickness is during summer and the lowest value is during equinox. The diurnal variation shows abnormal peaks at 1250 kilometers during 0300 LT– 0500 LT, the pre-sunrise hours {{in the summer of}} 2004. During daytime, the slab thickness ranges from 200 to 580 kilometers for all seasons. During nighttime, the value of slab thickness varies between 200 and 1250 kilometers. In addition, we investigate the slab thickness variation by making the comparison of slab thickness at Chumphon station in the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> with Kokubunji station in the mid latitude during 2004 – 2006, corresponding to the decreasing part of low solar activity. We found that the maximum ionospheric slab thickness value at Kokubunji is higher than the maximum value at Kokubunji. The result confirms that the slab thickness at the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> is larger than those found at mid latitude.|$|R

30|$|This study {{presents}} the diurnal and seasonal variations of slab thickness at the <b>equatorial</b> magnetic <b>latitudes</b> in Thailand during 2004 – 2006, {{corresponding to the}} declining part of low solar activity. The GPS-derived total electron content (TEC) and the maximum electron density of the F-region (NmF 2) are used to compute the slab thickness (τ) at the Chumphon station (10.72 °N, 99.37 °E), located near the magnetic equator. The results show that large peaks of slab thickness exist during the pre-sunrise hours in all three seasons at Chumphon when compared with other latitudes. The maximum value of slab thickness occurs when the peak electron density in the F 2 region is at the lowest level. During daytime, the slab thickness ranges from 200 kilometers to 580 kilometers for all seasons. During nighttime, the maximum value of slab thickness is 1250 kilometers {{in the summer of}} 2004. Moreover, the diurnal variation shows two minima that appear around 0900 LT and 1900 LT, during the post-sunrise and sunset hours. The seasonal variations show that the average slab thickness daily value is greater during summer and winter than those during equinox. Our study finds that the slab thickness at Chumphon located near the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> is much larger than those found at low, mid, and high latitudes. The difference in slab thickness between the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> and other zones is explained by the lack of plasma flow from the plasmasphere to the F 2 region at the magnetic equator.|$|R
60|$|Strolling {{one day in}} what is euphemistically termed, in <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitudes,</b> 'the cool of the evening,' along {{a tangled}} {{tropical}} American field-path, through a low region of lagoons and watercourses, my attention happened to be momentarily attracted from the monotonous pursuit of the nimble mosquito by a small animal scuttling along irregularly before me, {{as if in a}} great hurry {{to get out of my}} way before I could turn him into an excellent specimen. At first sight I took the little hopper, in the grey dusk, for one of the common, small green lizards, and wasn't much disposed to pay it any distinguished share either of personal or scientific attention. But as I walked on a little further through the dense underbrush, more and more of these shuffling and scurrying little creatures kept crossing the path, hastily, all in one direction, and all, as it were, in a formed body or marching phalanx. Looking closer, to my great surprise, I found they were actually fish out of water, going on a walking tour, for change of air, to a new residence--genuine fish, a couple of inches long each, not eel-shaped or serpentine in outline, but closely resembling a red mullet in miniature, though much more beautifully and delicately coloured, and with fins and tails of the most orthodox spiny and prickly description. They were travelling across country in a bee-line, thousands of them together, not at all like the helpless fish out of water of popular imagination, but as unconcernedly and naturally as if they had been accustomed to the overland route for their whole lifetimes, and were walking now on the king's highway without let or hindrance.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{describes}} the neural network (NN) application for {{the prediction of}} the total electron content (TEC) over Chumphon, an <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> station in Thailand. The studied period {{is based on the}} available data during the low-solar-activity period from 2005 to 2009. The single hidden layer feed-forward network with a back propagation algorithm is applied in this work. The input space of the NN includes the day number, hour number and sunspot number. An analysis was made by comparing the TEC from the neural network prediction (NN TEC), the TEC from an observation (GPS TEC) and the TEC from the IRI- 2007 model (IRI- 2007 TEC). To obtain the optimum NN for the TEC prediction, the root-mean-square error (RMSE) is taken into account. In order to measure the effectiveness of the NN, the normalized RMSE of the NN TEC computed from the difference between the NN TEC and the GPS TEC is investigated. The RMSE, and normalized RMSE, comparisons for both the NN model and the IRI- 2007 model are described. Even with the constraint of a limited amount of available data, the results show that the proposed NN can predict the GPS TEC quite well over the <b>equatorial</b> <b>latitude</b> station.|$|R
