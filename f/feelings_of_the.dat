But I can keep silence no longer, for these charges and suggestion have now been repeated by public men who have not scrupled to use their position to inflame the overstrained <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people.|$|E
5|$|The {{tradition}} of Voviyo (wedding songs), sung by women during a Ros, {{is important to}} this community. The procedure is that an elderly lady, usually the yejman (wife of the master of ceremonies, who is known as yejmani) who knows the voviyos, leads the song {{while the rest of}} the women sing along. Only women whose husbands are still living may sing. In ancient times, the wedding songs expressed very lofty sentiments and gave vent to the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> people about the marriage partners and their families, invoking the blessing of God on them.|$|E
5|$|While Trikoupis {{followed}} {{a policy of}} retrenchment within the established borders of the Greek state, having learned a valuable lesson about the vicissitudes of the Great Powers, his main opponents, the Nationalist Party led by Theodoros Deligiannis, sought to inflame the anti-Turkish <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greeks at every opportunity. The next opportunity arose in 1885 when Bulgarians rose in revolt in Eastern Rumelia and united the province with Bulgaria. Deligiannis rode to victory over Trikoupis in elections that year saying that if the Bulgarians could defy the Treaty of Berlin, so should the Greeks.|$|E

5|$|Athens {{was chosen}} as the Greek capital for {{historical}} and sentimental reasons, not because it was a large city. At the time, it was a town consisting of only 400 houses {{at the foot of the}} Acropolis. A modern city plan was laid out, and public buildings erected. The finest legacy of this period are the buildings of the University of Athens (1837, under the name Othonian University), the Athens Polytechnic University (1837, under the name Royal School of Arts), the National Gardens of Athens (1840), the National Library of Greece (1842), the Old Royal Palace (now the Greek Parliament Building, 1843), and the Old Parliament Building (1858). Schools and hospitals were established all over the (still small) Greek dominion, Due to the negative <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek people toward non-Greek rule, historical attention to this aspect of his reign has been neglected.|$|E
5|$|In 1655, Charles X Gustav of Sweden invaded and {{occupied}} western Poland–Lithuania, {{the eastern half}} of which was already occupied by Russia. The rapid Swedish advance became known in Poland as the Swedish Deluge. The Grand Duchy of Lithuania became a Swedish fief, the Polish–Lithuanian regular armies surrendered and the Polish king John II Casimir Vasa fled to the Habsburgs. Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg and Duke of Prussia initially supported the estates in Royal Prussia, but allied with Sweden in return for receiving the Duchy of Prussia as a Swedish fief. Exploiting the hurt religious <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Roman Catholic population under Protestant occupation and organizing Polish–Lithuanian military leaders in the Tyszowce Confederation, John II Casimir Vasa managed to regain ground in 1656. Russia took advantage of the Swedish setback, declared war on Sweden and pushed into Lithuania and Swedish Livonia.|$|E
5|$|The Sermons of Swift {{have none}} of that thunder which appals, or that resistless and winning {{softness}} which melts, the hearts of an audience. He can never have enjoyed the triumph of uniting hundreds in one ardent sentiment of love, of terror, or of devotion. His reasoning, however powerful, and indeed unanswerable, convinces the understanding, but is never addressed to the heart; and, indeed, from his instructions to a young clergyman, he seems hardly to have considered pathos as a legitimate ingredient in an English sermon. Occasionally, too, Swift's misanthropic habits break out even from the pulpit; nor is he altogether able to suppress his disdain of those fellow mortals, on whose behalf was accomplished the great work of redemption. With such unamiable feelings towards his hearers, the preacher might indeed command their respect, but could never excite their sympathy. It may be feared that his Sermons were less popular from another cause, imputable more to the congregation than to the pastor. Swift spared not the vice of rich or poor; and, disdaining to amuse the imaginations of his audience with discussion of dark points of divinity, or warm them by a flow of sentimental devotion, he rushes at once {{to the point of}} moral depravity, and upbraids them with their favourite and predominant vices in a tone of stern reproof, bordering upon reproach. In short, he tears the bandages from their wounds, like the hasty surgeon of a crowded hospital, and applies the incision knife and caustic with salutary, but rough and untamed severity. But, alas! the mind must be already victorious over the worst of its evil propensities, that can profit by this harsh medicine. There is a principle of opposition in our nature, which mans itself with obstinacy even against avowed truth, when it approaches our feelings in a harsh and insulting manner. And Swift was probably sensible, that his discourses, owing to these various causes, did not produce the powerful effects most grateful to the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> preacher, because they reflect back to him those of the audience.|$|E

50|$|For him, <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{beautiful}} is {{in seeing}} {{an object that}} invites the observer to transcend individuality, and simply observe the idea underlying <b>the</b> object. <b>The</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sublime, however, is when the object does not invite such contemplation but instead is an overpowering or vast malignant object of great magnitude, one that could destroy the observer.|$|R
30|$|Design 2 was {{inspired}} by a skyline and a linear form of a skyscraper of a city. It expressed an ambivalent characteristic, say, <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> flexible fur and that <b>of</b> upright <b>of</b> <b>the</b> building. The entire silhouette was expressed as a form of a round curve for <b>the</b> flexible <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> fur and <b>the</b> inside fur was cut straightly for <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> skyscraper. Dress color was expressed with a gray tone giving a <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> city skyscraper and sky blue, a color <b>of</b> <b>the</b> sky.

25|$|The <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> {{members of}} this {{movement}} against the participation of foreign-born citizens in municipal affairs had grown very bitter, and Westervelt set himself so sternly against them that his house was mobbed again. Probably due to the paucity of support for his reformist efforts during his term, but also because he applied himself {{more and more to}} the business of shipbuilding again, Westervelt declined a renomination, which for him was equivalent to an election, and was succeeded as Mayor by Fernando Wood. In 1857 Westervelt {{became a member of the}} New York State Assembly for Rockland County.|$|E
25|$|At {{the time}} of release, reporters and music critics, and {{everyone}} who had worked on the album, traveled to Long View Farm, a recording studio in Massachusetts for a press preview of the album.

The album {{was viewed as a}} guided tour through a wide range of musical styles and the life and <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> artist. It included recollections of childhood, of first love and lost love. It contained songs about faith and love among all peoples and songs about social justice for the poor and downtrodden.|$|E

The young man departs for Parme. Mosca once more opens his heart to Gina. Next, Fabrice and Clélia meet at the charterhouse, and in darkness and Fabrice blesses Clélia's marriage to the marquis. A chorus tells of the life of Fabrice from his attachment to the Napoleonic cause to his retreat into orders.|$|E
25|$|Although {{in general}} the Romans {{regarded}} marriage as a male-female union {{for the purpose of}} producing children, a few scholars believe that in the early Imperial period some male couples were celebrating traditional marriage rites in the presence of friends. Male-male weddings are reported by sources that mock them; the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> participants are not recorded. Both Martial and Juvenal refer to marriage between males as something that occurs not infrequently, although they disapprove of it. Roman law did not recognize marriage between males, but one of the grounds for disapproval expressed in Juvenal's satire is that celebrating the rites would lead to expectations for such marriages to be registered officially. As the empire was becoming Christianized in the 4th century, legal prohibitions against marriage between males began to appear.|$|E
25|$|According to Goenner, the {{contributions}} to the book are a mixture of mathematical–physical incompetence, hubris, and the <b>feelings</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> critics of being suppressed by contemporary physicists advocating for the new theory. The compilation of the authors show, Goenner continues, {{that this was not}} a reaction within the physics community—only one physicist (Karl Strehl) and three mathematicians (Jean-Marie Le Roux, Emanuel Lasker and Hjalmar Mellin) were present—but a reaction of an inadequately educated academic citizenship, which didn't know what to do with relativity. As regards the average age of the authors: 57% were substantially older than Einstein, one third was around the same age, and only two persons were substantially younger. Two authors (Reuterdahl, von Mitis) were antisemitic and four others were possibly connected to the Nazi movement. On the other hand, no antisemitic expression can be found in the book, and it also included contributions of some authors of Jewish ancestry (Salomo Friedländer, Ludwig Goldschmidt, Hans Israel, Emanuel Lasker, Oskar Kraus, Menyhért Palágyi).|$|E
50|$|Although rigid lenses are {{generally}} considered to be not as comfortable as soft lenses, overnight Ortho-K is generally very well accepted, since <b>the</b> main cause <b>of</b> rigid lens discomfort during waking hours is <b>the</b> <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> eyelids moving over the lens edges while blinking. Since Ortho-K lenses are worn when the eyes are closed for sleep, so there is no blinking and therefore generally no residual <b>feeling</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lens after the adaptation period.|$|R
