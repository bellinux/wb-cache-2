Residents attribute that their new diversity of ethnicity and professions coupled to their new infrastructure of roads, markets, and supermarkets has created a durable base for their new community as well (remarkably) as doing so at relatively affordable cost. Specific drivers of financial sustainability are attributed to the various types of businesses ranging from operating supermarkets, shops, general markets (such as Kubwa Market, site 2-phase 1 Market, etc.) engaged by community members. Other drivers include the fact that above 60 percent of the residents are civil servants who work with the federal and capital territory government organizations/institutions. The remaining are entrepreneurs, private security agents, low-cost housing builders, truck pushers, commercial motorcycle riders and real estate practitioners. Also, the establishment of cooperative societies and huge investments by community members have had huge influence on Kubwa financial sustainability. The community-friendly investment flexibilities of the cooperative societies are main reasons for huge financial investment by community members which include monthly and weekly cash deposits, higher <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> as compared to other financial institutions, etc.|$|E

Analysis of the long-run average cost curves {{in combination with the}} 1968 weighted Utah beef price revealed that all four ranch sizes studied are capable of meeting cash costs. If the goal of the ranch operator is to meet both cash costs and depreciation, a cattle ranch supporting 105 breeding cows is the minimum size necessary. If provision is made to cover cash costs and depreciation in addition to receiving a fair return for operator and family labor, the ranch must support at least 360 breeding cows. None of the four ranch sizes studied were capable of meeting all production costs including five per cent <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment.</b> The minimum ranch size necessary to cover all production costs including 1. 4 per cent <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> is 500 head of breeding cows. Farmer questionnaires and the machine capacity technique provided data from which five long-run average cost curves were derived by connecting points representing average production costs and levels of wheat output for four sizes of wheat farms (500, 1000, 2000, and 3000 acres). The long-run average cost curves were analyzed in combination with the 1968 Utah wheat price. All four wheat farm sizes studied are capable of meeting cash costs. In order to cover both cash costs and depreciation a wheat farm of at least 940 acres is required. The minimum wheat farm size necessary to meet cash costs and depreciation as well as provide a fair return to operator and family labor is 2430 acres. None of the four sizes of wheat farms studied was large enough to cover all costs including <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> at five per cent. In order to cover all production costs including 0, 64 per cent <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> a wheat farm of at least 3000 acres is required, Costs and returns to five management alternatives for marginal Utah cropland ((1) wheat production by owner-operator, (2) leasing crop [...] land to tenants for dryland wheat production, (3) leasing forage on an AUM basis, (4) leasing of forage on a livestock gain basis, and (5) stocker cattle production by the land owner) were compared in the shortrun, in the long-run assuming that all inputs were variable, and in the long-run assuming that land and operator and family labor were fixed, For the marginal cropland owner who also owns wheat production factors, wheat production on an owner-operator basis is the most favorable short-run alternative. Wheat production on a tenant basis is the only short-run alternative open to cropland owners who own neither wheat production factors nor the improvements necessary for grazing enterprises. Leasing forage on a livestock gain basis is the most favorable short-run alternative for cropland owners whose holdings are equipped with grazing improvements. For the long-run situation in which all inputs were considered variable, all five management alternatives yielded negative returns. Under such conditions a rational land owner would refuse to choose from among the five alternatives studied and would instead liquidate his land holdings. When operator and family labor and land were considered fixed, leasing cropland to tenants for dryland wheat production proved to be the most favorable long-run management alternative. Showing the second highest internal rate of return was leasing forage on a livestock gain basis followed ~ stocker cattle production by the land owner.

The problem is modelled under two criteria as a Markov decision process; the characteristics of the optimal policies under the two criteria are compared.

40|$|In {{this article}} we discuss {{fundamentals}} of the debt securities pricing. We begin with a generalization of the present value concept. Though the present value is the base valuation method in the modern finance we will illustrate that this concept does not sufficiently accurate in producing instrument pricing. The incompleteness of the unique present value approach stems from variability of the interest rates. Admitting variability of the interest rates we define two present values one for buyer other for seller. Therefore future buyer and seller cash payments can be described by the correspondent present values. Usually used assumption that future <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment</b> over a specified time period {{would be the same}} as before specified period is a theoretical simplification that might be admitted or not. Admitting such assumption leads to eliminating {{an important component of the}} market risk. Recall that the assumption that a future payment can be invested with the same constant interest rate equal to the one used in the past is a component of the group conditions that specify frictionless of the market. We use this new concept that splits present value within two counterparties to outline details of the new valuation method of the fixed income securities. The primary goal of this paper is a credit derivative pricing method of the risky debt instruments. First we introduce a formal definition of the default. It somewhat close but does not coincide with the reduced form of the default setting. ...|$|E
40|$|A farm storage {{building}} is a good investment for many agricultural operations. The building {{can be used to}} store hay, machinery, or both. As a result, the value of these commodities will be worth more than if left in the field. However, does the increased value of stored hay or machinery offset the cost of owning a building? The following discussion examines the costs and savings of owning a farm {{storage building}}. Cost of Barn Storage Barn storage is the best method for preserving hay and protecting machinery. However, a storage structure can be expensive to build. Initial building cost depends on several factors including building style, material costs, and labor costs. Initial cost of construction can range from $ 4. 00 per square foot for an open-sided barn to over $ 6. 00 per square foot for a fully enclosed barn. Example 1. Calculate the estimated cost of an opensided barn that is 100 feet long and 50 feet wide. 100 feet x 50 feet = 5, 000 square feet 5, 000 square feet x $ 4. 00 /square feet = $ 20, 000 To evaluate the feasibility of constructing a storage barn, the initial building cost must be converted into an annual cost. The annual cost of barn storage includes depreciation, <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment,</b> repairs, taxes, and insurance. Table 1 shows how to calculate the annual cost of storage for the barn described in Example 1. You can enter your figures to estimate the cost of storage for your barn. Depreciation is the cost associated with wear and tear on the building. Most farm buildings have a useful life Table 1. Total annual cost of a 100 -foot by 50 -foot, open-sided farm storage building.

40|$|The {{adoption}} {{and use of}} diversified cropping practices has become widely accepted by producers. However, the profitability of an enterprise {{is dependent on the}} biophysical and economic factors. The biophysical factors determine the enterprise relationship among the various crops, their interactions with the ecosystem, and how each of them fits into the overall management plan. The economic factors determine the relative advantage of each crop and service in the farm plan. Although there have been experimental studies in Canada examining the impacts of rotations on the agronomics of field crops, there is limited research in modeling economic and environmental dynamics of the potato production system. Potato production in Manitoba has rapidly increased in recent years and became the second largest potato producer in Canada producing about 22. 2 % of the total Canada's potato production as of 2004. Alberta has had similar expansion with the highest yield per acre in Canada. The expansion of potato industry in these two provinces and other parts of Canada has created some concerns about agro-environmental indicators such as water contamination, soil erosion and long-term profitability of potato production practices. The objective {{of this study was to}} address some of these concerns and develop a dynamic model that integrates environmental and economic components of potato production systems and estimates sustainability of some of the agricultural practices. A Stella Modeling framework was developed to provide crop production and environmental input to an economic model of potato rotations. The economic performance of different potato rotations ranging from two to four years in duration, and containing potatoes in combination with oilseed, cereal, forage, and legume crops was evaluated based on standard budgeting techniques. Net income was estimated as the income remaining above cash costs (i. e., seed, fertilizer, chemical, fuel and oil, repairs, crop insurance premium, miscellaneous, land taxes, and interest cost on variable inputs), ownership costs (depreciation, <b>interest</b> <b>on</b> <b>investment,</b> and insurance and housing) for machinery and grain storage, and labour. All annual inputs used in each phase of rotation for each management treatment, the type and frequency of field operation, year and replicate including pre-plant activities, tillage, fertilization, planting, insects and pests control, harvesting, storage, and transportation were included in the analysis. Modelling the economics of irrigated potato rotations required input from an agro-environmental model. This agro-environmental model was developed to simulate nutrient dynamics, soil moisture dynamics, soil characteristics and erosion, soil organic matter content, residue decomposition, and crop growth. The economic model takes into account economic factors and costs that are influenced by yield function, nutrients and crop water thus establishing the link between the agro-environmental module and the economic module. Farm operation costs in our model are divided into two categories: dependent costs and base costs. Dependent costs are costs that are controlled by the agro-environmental module, including yield dependent costs, irrigation dependent costs and fertilizer dependent costs. Base costs were developed through experimental evaluation with E-Views and remain constant throughout the rotation. On the agro-environmental side, the model outputs the changes in soil organic matter, soil loss due to erosion, and carbon dioxide emission due to decomposition and mineralization. Results of the model show that changes in these variables are dependent upon the length of, and the crops involved in, the rotation. The economic model results showed highest average net revenue was found in shorter two-year rotations due to the greater frequency of potato. Crop Production/Industries,...|$|E
