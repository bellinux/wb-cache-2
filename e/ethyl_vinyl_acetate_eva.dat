Furthermore, this investigation presents a mathematical model that relates the maximum force capacity of the glass laminated structure to the glass plate thickness, type and thickness of the inter-layer regardless the position of the fixed glass plate. Both practical work results and the theoretical model indicate that the maximum load capacity of laminated glass bonded with either PVB or EVA decreases as the interlayer thickness increases. Moreover, the maximum load capacity for the glasses bonded with EVA is greater than those for the PVB bonded ones under the same conditions.

50|$|The {{athletic}} shoe midsole {{is one of}} {{the main}} contributors that lead to a generation of end-of-life waste because it is composed of polymeric foams based on ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>EVA).</b> Ethylene <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>EVA)</b> is a polyolefin copolymer of ethylene and <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> that provides durability and flexibility, making it the most commonly used material found in athletic shoe midsoles. Although the synthetic polymer is a useful material for the athletic shoe industry, it has become an environmental concern because of its poor biodegradability. EVA goes through an anaerobic decomposition process called thermal degradation that often occurs in landfills resulting in releases of volatile organic compounds (VOC’s) into the air. VOC’s “contribute to the formation of tropospheric ozone, which is harmful to humans and plant life.” Thermal degradation of EVA is temperature dependent and occurs in two stages; in the first stage acetic acid is lost, followed by the degradation of the unsaturated polyethylene polymer.|$|R

Some of the disadvantages of vegetable oil are high pour point, low oxidative stability, and limited viscosity range. In this paper, we evaluate and compare the rheological properties of rice bran oil (RBO) with various proportions of low-density polyethylene (LDPE) and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>EVA)</b> separately. The thermal stability also has been tested in this paper. Both the polymers have different mode of improving the viscosity and LDPE {{is found to be}} a viscosity index booster. The percentage improvement in viscosity for various proportions of polymers has been eval-uated at various temperatures. It is seen that LDPE is more suited for engine oil applications since the high temperature rheology is more important in the selection of these lubricants. The viscosity variation of biolubricant formulations with temperature were validated with Walther equation. The biodegradability of both the polymers was estimated and compared with a commercially available mineral oil.

40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of plastic {{production}} is considered as a serious source of environment pollution. Approximately 100 million tons of plastics are produced each year and within {{a short period of}} time almost half are disposed to the environment. A way to overcome this problem would be the use of biodegradable polymers. Several attempts are made to replace synthetic polymers by biodegradable ones. Nevertheless, they did not prove yet to be useful for commercial applications due to their high price or limitations in terms of thermal and mechanical properties. Alternative to biodegradable polymers are biobased polymers, which can be prepared by blending or copolymer formation of a biodegradable and a synthetic polymer. Thus, the present work aims to prepare copolymers of <b>ethyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>EVA)</b> and poly(ξ-caprolactone) (PCL), EVA-g-PCL, and to study the influence of the molar mass of EVA on copolymer formation and its properties. The materials were prepared in a internal batch mixer using titanium propoxide (Ti(OPr) 4) as catalyst. Characterization was performed by selective extraction of the formed copolymers, SEM, FTIR, rheology, DSC, TGA and tensile properties. Morphological results by SEM evidence copolymer formation, the particle size of the dispersed phase decreases as the EVA molar mass decreases. The tensile properties of the prepared materials are similar to the ones of synthetic polymers.

40|$|This work {{explores the}} {{differences}} between walking locomotion on rigid pavement and {{a particular type of}} flexible pavements made of EVA 75 foam having thickness of either 10 or 20 mm. The aim is to analyse how human movements, in terms of trajectories of different body parts, are influenced by rigidity of such pavements. This research line is ultimately directed towards evaluation of the influence of flexible pavement on the vibration perception by human test subjects walking over vibrating decks of lively footbridges and floors. The experiments were carried out in the Structures Laboratory at the University of Warwick, UK. A part of a 20 m long walkway was monitored using six infrared cameras. Three test subjects, instrumented with reflective body markers were asked to walk over the walkway made of concrete. Nominally the same experiments were then conducted on the walkway covered with one 10 mm thick layer of foam (<b>ethyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> <b>EVA</b> 75) first, and then with two layers of foam having thickness of 20 mm. Mechanical properties of the foam and its influence on the vertical ground reaction forces (GRFz) depending on the number of layers are studied. The trajectories of the reflective markers attached to the human anatomical landmarks are traced using the Vicon motion capture system. Averaged amplitudes of movement for chosen markers are compared for walking over the three supporting surfaces. While the first peak in the GRFz decreases when increasing thickness of the foam the magnitudes of displacements and accelerations of all analysed markers increase. The findings reveal that human walking on surfaces of different flexibility can be characterised by acceleration of body segments {{as well as by the}} way the forces propagate through the body via skeletal system...|$|E

The {{purpose of this study was}} to determine the effect of a composite insole, <b>Ethyl</b> <b>Vinyl</b> <b>Acetate</b> (<b>EVA)</b> with Poron layer on ground reaction force on subjects with flexible flat foot in comparison with common EVA insole. Materials and Methods: Fifty two subjects (14 Male and 38 female) between 18 - 40 years of age with flexible flat foot participated in this study. Twenty six subjects received Poron insole (EVA with Poron layer) and 26 subjects received common EVA insole. After assessment each subject asked to walk with normal speed across two force plate in two conditions, walking with insole and shoe and walking without insole. Then each subject asked to use insole for forty hours during two weeks. Vertical ground reaction force in the first session and after two weeks was assessed. Results: Impact force and first peak of vertical ground reaction force (F 1) with Poron insole in comparison with shoe significantly increased in second session (P< 0. 05). The second peak (F 3) with common insole in comparison with shoe significantly increased in second session (P< 0. 05). Significant reduction was noted in first peak (F 1) with common insole in second session in comparison with first session (P< 0. 05). There was no observable significant difference in two groups before and after intervention. Conclusion: The results of this preliminary study show that both insoles change vertical ground reaction force in comparison with shoe alone.

40|$|Titanium dioxide (TiO 2) {{thin films}} {{have a long}} history in silicon {{photovoltaics}} (PV) as antireflection (AR) coatings due to their excellent optical properties and low deposition cost. This work explores several novel areas where TiO 2 thin films could be use to enhance silicon (Si) solar cell performance while reducing device fabrication costs. Amorphous, anatase and rutile TiO 2 thin films are deposited using ultrasonic spray deposition (USD) and chemical vapour deposition (CVD) systems, both designed and constructed by the author. Initial experiments confirmed that no degradation in the bulk minority carrier lifetime (&# 131;Ñbulk) occurred during high-temperature processing, although the stability of the USD-deposited TiO 2 films was dependent on the furnace ambient. A major disadvantage of TiO 2 AR coatings is that they afford little surface passivation. In this work, a novel method of achieving excellent surface passivation on TiO 2 -coated silicon wafers is presented. This involved growing a 6 nm-thick SiO 2 layer at the TiO 2 :Si interface by oxidising the wafer after TiO 2 film deposition. The increase in surface passivation afforded by the interfacial SiO 2 layer results in a decrease in the emitter dark saturation current density (J 0 e) by nearly two orders of magnitude to 4. 7 &# 8722; 7. 7 ~ 10 &# 8722; 14 A/cm 2. This demonstrates the compatibility of the TiO 2 /SiO 2 stack with high-efficiency solar cells designs. By varying the film deposition and annealing conditions, TiO 2 refractive indices in the range of 1. 726 &# 8722; 2. 633 (at &# 131;É = 600 nm) could be achieved. Subsequently, a double-layer antireflection (DLAR) coating was designed comprised of low and high TiO 2 refractive index material. The best experimental weighted average reflectance (Rw) achieved was 6. 5 % on a planar silicon wafer in air. TiO 2 DLAR coatings are ideally suited to multicrystalline silicon (mc-Si) wafers, which do not respond well to chemical texturing. Modelling performed for a glass and <b>ethyl</b> <b>vinyl</b> <b>acetate</b> (<b>EVA)</b> encapsulated buried-contact solar cell indicated that a TiO 2 DLAR coating afforded a 7 % increase in the short circuit current density, when compared to a standard, commercially-deposited TiO 2 single-layer AR coating. Finally, it is demonstrated that chemical reactions with phosphorus prevent TiO 2 from acting as a successful phosphorus diffusion barrier or dopant source. The applicability of TiO 2 thin films to various silicon solar cell structures is discussed...|$|E
