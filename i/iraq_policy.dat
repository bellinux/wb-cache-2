5|$|A win by McCain over Huckabee in South Carolina, and by Romney over McCain in childhood-home Michigan, set up {{a pivotal}} battle in the Florida primary. Romney campaigned intensively on {{economic}} issues and the burgeoning subprime mortgage crisis, while McCain attacked Romney regarding <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy</b> and benefited from endorsements from Florida officeholders. McCain won a 5percentage point victory on January 29. Although many Republican officials were now lining up behind McCain, Romney persisted through the nationwide Super Tuesday contests on February 5. There he won primaries or caucuses in several states, but McCain won in more and in larger-population ones. Trailing McCain in delegates by a more than two-to-one margin, Romney announced {{the end of his}} campaign on February 7.|$|E
500|$|Biden made {{visits to}} Iraq about {{once every two}} months, {{including}} trips to Baghdad in August and September 2009 to listen to Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki and reiterate U.S. stances on Iraq's future; by this time he had become the administration's point man in delivering messages to Iraqi leadership about expected progress in the country. More generally, overseeing <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy</b> became Biden’s responsibility, when the president said in 2009: [...] "Joe, you do Iraq". [...] Biden said Iraq [...] "could {{be one of the}} great achievements of this administration." [...] Biden's January 2010 visit to Iraq in the midst of turmoil over banned candidates from the upcoming Iraqi parliamentary election resulted in 59 of the several hundred candidates being reinstated by the Iraqi government two days later. [...] By 2012, Biden had made eight trips there, but his oversight of U.S. policy in Iraq receded with the exit in 2011 of U.S. troops.|$|E

2500|$|Several Republicans, {{including}} Senators Chuck Hagel, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe, also {{applauded the}} report's conclusions. Snowe said that [...] "It gives impetus {{to both the}} Congress and hopefully the president" [...] and that [...] "The {{time has come to}} change our course and to support a plan… that ultimately leads to a withdrawal of troops from Iraq." [...] Even more forcefully, Senator Gordon Smith (R-OR), a longstanding supporter of the war, responded to the report by publicly breaking with the Bush Administration's, calling Bush' <b>Iraq</b> <b>Policy</b> [...] "absurd" [...] and possibly [...] "criminal".|$|E
2500|$|MSNBC {{also brought}} the American flag back on screen and {{regularly}} ran a tribute called [...] "America's Bravest" [...] which showed photographs sent {{by family members}} of troops deployed in Iraq. MSNBC also fired liberal Phil Donahue, a critic of Bush's <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy,</b> {{a month before the}} invasion began and replaced his show with an expanded Countdown: Iraq, initially hosted by Lester Holt. Shortly after Donahue's firing, MSNBC hired Michael Savage, a controversial conservative radio talk show host for a Saturday afternoon show. Although Donahue's show had lower ratings than several shows on other networks, and most reports on its cancellation blamed poor ratings, it was the highest-rated program on MSNBC's struggling primetime lineup {{at the time of its}} cancellation. In September 2002, Donahue's show averaged 365,000 viewers, compared to rival Connie Chung's 686,000 on CNN and Bill O'Reilly's 2 million on Fox News, according to Nielsen Media Research.|$|E
2500|$|Starting {{in early}} 2006, Lantos {{distanced himself from}} the Bush Administration's <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy,</b> making {{critical}} statements at hearings, on the House floor and in published media interviews about {{the conduct of the}} war. During hearings of the House International Relations Committee, where he was then the ranking member, Lantos repeatedly praised the investigative work of the office of the Special Inspector of Iraq Reconstruction General Stuart Bowen, which uncovered evidence of waste, fraud and abuse in the use of U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help secure and rebuild Iraq. Lantos was an immediate and consistent critic of the troop surge advocated by President Bush. On the night in January 2007 that Bush announced his plan, Lantos responded, [...] "I oppose the so-called surge that constitutes the centerpiece of the President's plan. Our efforts in Iraq are a mess, and throwing in more troops will not improve it." ...|$|E
25|$|From January 1993 {{until my}} {{resignation}} from the United Nations in August 1998, I witnessed first hand the duplicitous <b>Iraq</b> <b>policies</b> {{of the administration}} of Bill Clinton, the implementation of which saw a President lie to the American people about a threat he knew was hyped, lie to Congress about his support of a disarmament process his administration {{wanted nothing to do}} with, and lie to the world about American intent, which turned its back on the very multilateral embrace of diplomacy as reflected in the resolutions of the Security Council Hillary Clinton so piously refers to in her speech, and instead pursued a policy defined by the unilateral interests of the Clinton administration to remove Saddam Hussein from power.|$|R
40|$|By {{the early}} 1990 s, when I began {{studying}} the Vietnam War, the American public had largely {{lost interest in}} the history of that conflict. The Civil War and World War II were the wars that historians were advised to cover if they wanted to reach the public. Among government officials, military officers, and political scientists, Vietnam was considered irrelevant, because the United States would never get caught in protracted counterinsurgency warfare again. Iraq changed all that. Ever since the outbreak of insurgency in the former empire of Saddam Hussein, people of all persuasions have been mining the history of Vietnam for information that will support their preferred <b>Iraq</b> <b>policies.</b> Hundreds of thousands of American troops sent to Iraq and Afghanistan have received more instruction on Vietnam than on any other historical subject...|$|R

2500|$|The next day, {{a team of}} FBI {{agents and}} Justice {{prosecutors}} investigating the leak questioned the deputy secretary. Armitage acknowledged that he had passed along to Novak information contained in a classified State Department memo: that Wilson's wife worked on weapons-of-mass-destruction issues at the CIA... felt obligated to inform White House counsel Alberto Gonzales. But Powell and his aides feared the White House would then leak that Armitage had been Novak's source – possibly to embarrass State Department officials who had been unenthusiastic about Bush's <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy.</b> So Taft told Gonzales the bare minimum: that the State Department had passed some information about the case to Justice. He didn't mention Armitage. Taft asked if Gonzales {{wanted to know the}} details. The president's lawyer, playing the case by the book, said no, and Taft told him nothing more. Armitage's role thus remained that rarest of Washington phenomena: a hot secret that never leaked.|$|E

[...] In his work in cooperation with the state department, Ellison stresses the religious freedom available in the U.S., saying things like [...] "religious tolerance has a much longer pedigree in America than some of the intolerance we've seen lately." [...] Even in his work with the State Department he remained critical of President Bush's <b>Iraq</b> <b>policy</b> saying [...] "he wants people around the world to know that 'there are many Americans who want to relate to the rest of the world in terms of cooperation, not military domination.'" [...] Ellison staffers told reporters that [...] "the State Department has shown no signs of squeamishness about publicizing his criticism of the war." [...] When asked about working with elements of the Bush administration Ellison said [...] "Hey, my country first. We can work out our political differences later. I've said I'm willing to do whatever I can to make some friends for America." ...|$|E

50|$|Lingle {{spent much}} of 2004 campaigning for Republican candidates, both in the Presidential {{election}} and the Hawaii state legislature. She supported President George W.

When some polling late in the election showed Bush tied or narrowly leading Democrat John Kerry, Lingle attempted to help Republicans carry her state {{for the first time}} since 1984. Vice President Dick Cheney also campaigned in the state. The state legislature had a Democratic supermajority and she wanted to have enough members to block them from overriding her vetoes. Ultimately, not only did Kerry win the state, but Republicans lost five seats in the state legislature, reducing their presence to near single-digits and causing the Democrats to consider Lingle more vulnerable than they initially expected. In spite of their new confidence, Lingle was re-elected after her 2006 re-election campaign.|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{relationship}} between the media and politics by analyzing the Iraq War coverage of two leading U. S. and Japanese newspapers: the New York Times and the Asahi. This dissertation reveals that these two print media, although both liberal in their general orientation, treated the Iraq War differently. First, it quantitatively finds that they are quite distinctive in their choice of main topics. During the run-up period to the war, the Asahi put more focus {{on the role of the}} United Nations while the majority of the stories appearing in the New York addressed U. S. decisions about Iraq. Second, the dissertation's qualitative analysis of editorials reveals that a different emphasis on who the "evil" doers in the war are. While the New York treated the oppressive Saddam Hussein regime and terrorists as the "evildoers," the Asahi portrayed the U. S. as the big evil doer. Further, content analysis of articles written by embedded journalists who were with coalition forces in Iraq revealed that the two newspapers' articles showed significant disparities in the degree of sympathy they showed to the forces. Numerous background factors have influenced this media content. Interviews with Japanese journalists and scholars revealed that the cultures of anti-militarism held by Japanese that originated from Japan's defeat in World War II remain firm within Japanese news organizations. Anti-militaristic sentiments and cultural factors, such as religion, appear to have influenced how their organizations portrayed the war in Iraq. Further, this dissertation statistically shows that the media's impact is significant in shaping the political agenda and public opinion. Poll data of Japanese sentiments about the United States show a decline in positive feelings towards the United States as the ratio of negative stories of U. S. <b>Iraq</b> <b>policies</b> carried by the Asahi rose. In addition, the Asahi's critical assessments of the Japanese government's <b>Iraq</b> <b>policies</b> showed a moderate negative congruence with public support for their Cabinet. Also, there was a moderate negative relationship between the New York Times' unfavorable coverage of the U. S. government's <b>policies</b> of <b>Iraq</b> and presidential approval ratings...|$|R

40|$|The diploma thesis "Republican Foreign Policy and the War in Iraq" {{deals with}} the process of U.

It tracks the development of the intraparty debate on the war in Iraq in reaction to the gradually worsening security situation in the country. It analyzes positions of various schools of thoughts within the American conservative movement and the changing configuration of power in American politics in the studied period. The thesis aims to explain why the <b>Iraq</b> <b>policies</b> of the Bush administration remained virtually intact up until January 2007 despite failing to deliver satisfactory results and what factors shaped this outcome of the conservative debate on Iraq. Three hypotheses are offered to answer the research questions. The first concerns President Bush's management style and the setup of the policymaking process within his administration.
