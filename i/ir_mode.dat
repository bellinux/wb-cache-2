B-type carbonate substitution causes a broadening of the v(1) P-O stretching mode {{that is associated with}} the atomic disorder and lowering of the local symmetry in CAps from C- 6 h(2) to C- 3 h.

We study two different BA schemes, BA-all, in which the caller accepts any set of available timeslots, and BA-n, in which the caller specifies n call-initiation time options. Numerical results show that the BA-all achieves 95 % utilization with a call-blocking probability of only 1 %, while in the <b>IR</b> <b>mode,</b> call blocking probability is 23 % even when utilization is only 80 %. TheBA-n schemes perform as well as theBA-all scheme if the call-initiation time options are restricted to fall on timeslot boundaries separated by the minimum call holding time. The length of the advance-reservation horizon, K, is shown to increase linearly with call holding time, H. The ratio K/H is primarily dependent on the link capacity in channels. For example, if the link is divided into 10 channels, to achieve a 2 % call blocking probability, the advance-reservation horizon needs to be a factor of 4 times the call holding time.

In this study, we compare the performances of thermal sources with synchrotron far-IR to record reaction-induced Fourier trans- form infrared (FT-IR) di ff erence signals with proteins in solution. Using the model protein Cu − azurin placed in a short path length electrochemical cell adapted for transmission spectroscopy in vacuum-purged optics, we show that minute spectral shifts induced by metal isotope labeling or temper- ature changes are detected using the far-IR beamline AILES of the synchrotron SOLEIL. On one hand, these data allow us to identify modes involving Cu − ligand vibrations and {{pave the way for}} the analysis of metal sites or metal redox states of proteins not amenable to resonance Raman spectroscopy.

40|$|We {{present an}} {{integral}} coupled mode theory (CMT), suited {{to account for}} high optical losses, to model ultra-broadband terahertz (THz) waveguide emitters (0. 1 - 20 THz) based on difference frequency generation (DFG) pumped by femtosecond infrared (IR) optical pulses. This integral model works even in the situation where the DFG occurs between several IR and THz modes. We also present a simplified CMT approximation that reproduces {{the results of the}} rigorous integral CMT for situations where the THz generation is mediated through single-IR-mode to single-THz-mode interactions. Using the simplified approach we derive a new expression that incorporates loss effects into the coherence length for optical rectification (OR). The expression that we derived for the coherence length can be adapted to describe other second order nonlinear processes such as second harmonic generation. We apply both models to study waveguide emitters whose nonlinear cores are composed of poled guest-host electro-optic (EO) polymer composites, which belong to the 1 mm symmetry class and have high nonlinearities. We apply the models to a generic, symmetric, five-layer, metal/cladding/core waveguide structure and provide design strategies for efficient ultra-broadband THz emitters. Two different design strategies are analyzed, one in which the waveguides are designed to have a single-IR-mode and a single-THz-mode guided within the structure, and other where the waveguide is made with a single-THz-mode but admits several IR guided modes. In both strategies the waveguide geometric parameters are optimized to obtain the highest THz conversion efficiencies and broader output bandwidth. The simplified CMT approach is much faster to implement than the integral CMT. Thus, we use the simplified approach to perform a parametric study for different waveguide parameters and pumping wavelengths, in the telecom and short wavelength infrared region, to establish under what conditions the five-layered structure yields its highest conversion efficiencies. Coupling conditions are also optimized to guarantee that most of the incident pump power (~ 80 %) is utilized in the interaction. We find conversion efficiencies as high as 35 x 10 &# 8722; 4 W &# 8722; 1 and bandwidths up to 20 THz for a structure with a core made of EO polymer AJTB 203, polystyrene cladding layers and Al metal-capping layers, when pumped at 1900 nm. We found that for an optimized structure there must be a perfect balance between both modal phase-matching and mode losses effects. Also, we observed that low-loss-cladding layers enhance the efficiency for phase-matched structures, increase the interaction length, and improve the stability of the efficiency with respect to variations in waveguide parameters. Finally, we identified under what conditions the simplified CMT approximation fails to describe broadband THz generation. For five-layered structures with thin cladding layers (~ 200 nm thick) both the fundamental and first excited IR modes are involved in the DFG interaction and both must be accounted for to completely describe THz DFG. This is necessary since the fundamental TM-IR mode of structure hybridizes into a plasmon mode as the cladding layers are thinned and THz generation occurs also through OR of the first excited even TM <b>IR</b> <b>mode.</b> The first excited even TM <b>IR</b> <b>mode</b> acts as a quasi-fundamental mode in the absence of cladding layers.

First, N(CH 3) 3 BH 3 was studied at room temperature and pressures up to 30 GPa. Under ambient conditions, N(CH 3) 3 BH 3 forms rhombohedral crystals. During compression, two phases transitions were observed, which was evidenced by the rich profile changes in Raman and IR spectra as well as by examining the pressure dependence of Raman and <b>IR</b> <b>modes.</b> Raman and <b>IR</b> spectra collectively revealed consistent structural information of N(CH 3) 3 BH 3.

The ‘Zn [...] OH’ <b>IR</b> translation <b>mode</b> is found at 445 cm − 1 and the Raman modes around 450 and 495 cm − 1. The CO 3 2 − group is identified by the ν 1 (IR) at 1112 cm − 1 and a doublet in the Raman around 1045 – 1055 and 1060 cm − 1. ν 2 (IR) is observed at 874 cm − 1. ν 3 (IR) is a doublet at 1359 and 1381 cm − 1. ν 4 is observed in both the IR and Raman spectra around 670 and 695 – 715 cm − 1, respectively. In the OH deformation region, a doublet is observed for ‘Al [...] OH’ at 955 and 1033 cm − 1 in the IR spectra. The ‘Zn [...] OH’ <b>IR</b> deformation <b>mode</b> is observed at 1462 cm − 1.

The OH stretching region is characterized by three bands in the Raman spectra around 3355 – 3360, 3440 – 3455 and 3535 – 3580 cm − 1. One band is observed in the IR spectra at 3471 cm − 1...|$|R
40|$|Far-infrared {{absorption}} spectroscopy {{has been used}} to study the low frequency ({center_dot} 100 cm{sup - 1 }) intermolecular modes of methanol in mixtures with water. With the aid of a first principles molecular dynamics simulation on an equivalent system, a detailed understanding about the origin of the low frequency <b>IR</b> <b>modes</b> has been established. The total dipole spectrum from the simulation suggests that the bands appearing in the experimental spectra at approximately 55 cm{sup - 1 } and 70 cm{sup - 1 } in methanol and methanol-rich mixtures arise from both fluctuations and torsional motions occurring within the methanol hydrogen-bonded chains. The influence of these modes on both the solvation dynamics and the relaxation mechanisms in the liquid are discussed within the context of recent experimental and theoretical results that have emerged from studies focusing on the short time dynamics in the methanol hydrogen bond network...|$|R
