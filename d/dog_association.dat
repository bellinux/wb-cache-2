25|$|In Australia, Border Collies are {{registered}} with an Australian National Kennel Council (ANKC) affiliated state control body {{or with a}} working dog registry. Between 2,011 and 2,701 ANKC pedigreed Border Collies have been registered with the ANKC each year since 1986. Inclusion on the ANKC affiliate's main register allows Border Collies to compete in conformation, obedience, agility, tracking, herding and other ANKC-sanctioned events held by an ANKC affiliated club, while inclusion on the limited register prohibits entry in conformation events. The ANKC provides a breed standard; however, this applies to conformation events only and has no influence on dogs entering in performance events. Non-ANKC pedigreed dogs may also be eligible for inclusion on an ANKC associate or sporting register {{and be able to}} compete in ANKC performance or herding events. Agility organisations such as the Agility <b>Dog</b> <b>Association</b> of Australia (ADAA) have their own registry which allows the inclusion of any dog wishing to compete in their events.|$|E

500|$|In 1958, [...] of the {{northern}} section of the asylum grounds were offered under a Crown Grant to the Talbot Colony for Epileptics. Later known as Royal Talbot (now part of Austin Health), the hospital and training centre continue to operate on the site to this day. [...] An area of Kew's grounds adjacent to the Talbot Colony was granted to the Guide <b>Dog</b> <b>Association</b> of Victoria for {{the building of a}} guide dog breeding and training centre, which opened in 1962.

2500|$|After World War II, {{the dogs}} {{continued}} to be popular pets. Postwar contact with Japan led to importation into the United States of the Japanese Spitz, {{which may have been}} crossed into the breed at this time. The breed was first officially recognized as the [...] "American Eskimo" [...] as early as 1919 by the American United Kennel Club (UKC), and the first written record and history of the breed was printed in 1958 by the UKC. At that time there was no official breed club and no breed standard, and dogs were accepted for registration as single dogs, based on appearance. In 1970 the National American Eskimo <b>Dog</b> <b>Association</b> (NAEDA) was founded, and single dog registrations ceased. In 1985 the American Eskimo Dog Club of America (AEDCA) was formed by fanciers who wished to register the breed with the American Kennel Club (AKC). Following the AKC's requirements for breed recognition, the AEDCA collected the pedigree information from 1,750 dogs that now form the basis of the AKC recognized breed, which is called the American Eskimo Dog. The breed was recognized by the American Kennel Club in 1995. The stud book was opened from 2000 to 2003 in an attempt to register more of the original UKC registered lines, and today many American Eskimo Dogs are dual-registered with both American kennel clubs. The breed is also recognized by the Canadian Kennel Club as of 2006, but is not recognized elsewhere in the world ...|$|E
