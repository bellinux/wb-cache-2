5|$|This {{thesis of}} a {{maritime}} foundation was {{contrary to the}} general scholarly consensus that the rise of civilization was based on <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture,</b> particularly {{of at least one}} cereal. The production of agricultural surpluses had long been seen as essential in promoting population density and the emergence of complex society. Moseley's ideas would be debated and challenged (that maritime remains and their caloric contribution were overestimated, for example) but have been treated as plausible as late as Mann's summary of the literature in 2005.|$|E
5|$|The forest areas {{suffer from}} strong {{demographic}} pressure and <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture.</b> Some forests locally known as bouças are defined areas with maritime pines, oaks and eucalyptus plantations. Forests are still important in parishes {{surrounded by the}} Serra de Rates, whose flora is distinguished by the pedunculate oak or the european holly. In the 18th century, the monks of Tibães planted pines, which characterized the civil parish of Estela. In the past the Atlantic forest predominated, with trees such as oaks, ash trees, hazels, strawberry trees, holm oak, and alders.|$|E
5|$|Major {{declines in}} populations have been {{observed}} from 1980 onward in Sweden, Finland, northern Russia (Karelia) and the Baltic States, and smaller declines {{in much of the}} rest of northern and central Europe. The bird has been adversely affected in these areas by <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture,</b> and in several countries it has been red-listed due to population declines of more than 50%. Numbers dwindled in the United Kingdom by more than 80% between 1966 and 2004; although populations in some areas such as Northern Ireland were stable or even increased, those in other areas, mainly England, declined even more sharply. The overall decline seems to be due to the low survival rate of young birds, which may be caused by changes in agricultural practices. The intensive farming methods used in northern Europe mean there is less pasture and meadow habitat available, and the supply of grassland invertebrates needed for the nestlings to thrive is correspondingly reduced.|$|E

5|$|By the 9th century, {{the crisis}} of the Classic Maya {{collapse}} was sweeping across the region, with populations plummeting and city after city falling into silence. Increasingly endemic warfare in the Maya region caused Tikal's supporting population to heavily concentrate close to the city itself, accelerating the use of <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> and the corresponding environmental decline. Construction continued {{at the beginning of the}} century, with the erection of Temple 3, the last of the city's major pyramids, and the erection of monuments to mark the 19th K'atun in 810. The beginning of the 10th Bak'tun in 830 passed uncelebrated, and marks the beginning of a 60-year hiatus, probably resulting from the collapse of central control in the city. During this hiatus, satellite sites traditionally under Tikal's control began to erect their own monuments featuring local rulers and using the Mutal emblem glyph, with Tikal apparently lacking the authority or the power to crush these bids for independence. In 849, Jewel K'awiil is mentioned on a stela at Seibal as visiting that city as the Divine Lord of Tikal but he is not recorded elsewhere and Tikal's once-great power was little more than a memory. The sites of Ixlu and Jimbal had by now inherited the once exclusive Mutal emblem glyph.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze whether the employment/productivity profile of growth {{as well as}} its sectoral pattern matter for poverty reduction. We also {{identify}} some conditions of the labor market which are associated with employment intensive growth or specific sectoral growth. We find that, in the short run, while the overall employment intensity of growth does not matter for poverty reduction, the sectoral pattern of employment growth and productivity growth is important. While employment intensive growth in the secondary sector appears to be associated with decreases in poverty, employment <b>intensive</b> growth in <b>agriculture</b> increases poverty. Similarly productivity <b>intensive</b> growth in <b>agriculture</b> is associated with poverty reduction. The results suggest that focusing on the aggregate employment elasticity of growth, alone, as a way to reduce poverty may lead to misleading policy recommendations and more be gained by focusing on secondary sector employment growth and productivity <b>intensive</b> growth in <b>agriculture.</b> 1 Poverty Reduction Group, World Ban...|$|R
5000|$|Goody has {{demonstrated}} a historical {{correlation between the}} practices of [...] "diverging devolution" [...] (dowry) {{and the development of}} <b>intensive</b> plough <b>agriculture</b> on the one hand, and homogenous inheritance (brideprice) and extensive hoe agriculture on the other. Drawing on the work of Ester Boserup, Goody notes that the sexual division of labour varies in <b>intensive</b> plough <b>agriculture</b> and extensive shifting horticulture. In sparsely populated regions where shifting cultivation takes place, most of the work is done by women. These are the societies that give brideprice. Boserup further associates shifting horticulture with the practice of polygamy, and hence bridewealth is paid as a compensation to her family for the loss of her labour. In plough agriculture farming is largely men's work; this is where dowry is given. [...] In contrast, plough agriculture is associated with private property and marriage tends to be monogamous, to keep the property within the nuclear family. Close family are the preferred marriage partners so as to keep property within the group.|$|R

25|$|Some {{techniques}} of <b>intensive</b> <b>agriculture</b> may be cruel to animals: foie gras is a food product {{made from the}} liver of ducks or geese that have been force fed corn to fatten the organ; veal is criticised because the veal calves may be highly restricted in movement, have unsuitable flooring, spend their entire lives indoors, experience prolonged deprivation (sensory, social, and exploratory), and be more susceptible to high amounts of stress and disease.|$|E
