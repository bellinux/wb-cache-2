5|$|The rainforests of Indonesia and Malaysia, {{which the}} Sumatran rhino inhabits, are also targets for {{legal and illegal}} logging because of the {{desirability}} of their hardwoods. Rare woods such as merbau, meranti and semaram are valuable on the <b>international</b> <b>markets,</b> fetching as much as $1,800perm3 ($1,375percuyd). Enforcement of illegal-logging laws is difficult because humans live within or near {{many of the same}} forests as the rhino. The 2004 Indian Ocean earthquake has been used to justify new logging. Although the hardwoods in the rainforests of the Sumatran rhino are destined for <b>international</b> <b>markets</b> and not widely used in domestic construction, the number of logging permits for these woods has increased dramatically because of the tsunami. However, while this species has been suggested to be highly sensitive to habitat disturbance, apparently it is of little importance compared to hunting, as it can withstand more or less any forest condition.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{primary goal}} of this {{introductory}} article is to highlight important contemporary themes in <b>international</b> <b>marketing</b> strategy {{from the perspective of}} Sub-Saharan African firms.

Findings: <b>International</b> <b>marketing</b> in Sub-Sahara Africa is growing steadily, driven largely by rapid changes in socio-economic and demographic characteristics of consumers in this market.
