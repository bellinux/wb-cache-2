After interring the deceased in a grave they may have used the eastern entrance to leave the cemetery. Alternatively, different groups of people may have used the two entrances, perhaps reflecting {{the fact that some of}} the graves do not fit into the overall square plan and may therefore belong to a different group.|$|E

5|$|Arthropods {{that are}} Narcissus pests include insects such as three species of fly that have larvae that attack the plants, {{narcissus}} bulb fly Merodon equestris, and two species of hoverflies, the lesser bulb flies Eumerus tuberculatus and Eumerus strigatus. The flies lay their eggs {{at the end of}} June in the ground around the narcissi, a single female fly being able to lay up to fifty eggs. The hatching larvae then burrow through the soil towards the bulbs and consume their interiors. They then overwinter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> bulb shell, emerging in April to pupate in the soil, from which the adult fly emerges in May. The larvae of some moths such as Korscheltellus lupulina (the common swift moth) attack Narcissus bulbs.|$|E
5|$|Liverpool Football Club is an English {{association}} {{football club}} based in Liverpool, Merseyside. The club {{was formed in}} 1892 following a disagreement between the board of Everton and club president John Houlding, who owned the club's ground, Anfield. The disagreement {{between the two parties}} over rent resulted in Everton moving to Goodison Park from Anfield, which left Houlding with an empty stadium. Thus, he founded Liverpool F.C. to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> stadium. Liverpool won the First Division title {{for the first time in}} 1901; since then, the club has won a further 17 league titles, along with seven FA Cups and eight Football League Cups. They have also been crowned champions of European football on five occasions by winning the European Cup/UEFA Champions League in 1977, 1978, 1981, 1984 and 2005. The club was one of 22 members of the Premier League when it was formed in 1992. They experienced the most successful period in their history under the management of Bob Paisley, who guided the team to 21 trophies in nine seasons.|$|E

5|$|Zero is a number, {{and numbers}} {{are used for}} counting. Given a set of objects, one uses a number to {{describe}} how many objects are in the set. Zero is the count of no objects; in more formal terms, it {{is the number of}} objects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>empty</b> set. The concept of parity is used for making groups of two objects. If the objects in a set can be marked off into groups of two, with none left over, then the number of objects is even. If an object is left over, then the number of objects is odd. The empty set contains zero groups of two, and no object is left over from this grouping, so zero is even.|$|E

40|$|The {{role of the}} {{proximal}} and distal stomach <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of solids and liquids from the stomach remains unclear. We have used a dual isotope technique to quantify proximal and distal stomach emptying of a solid (100 g of 99 mTc labelled liver/ground beef) liquid (either 200 ml of normal saline (eight subjects) or 25 % dextrose (seven subjects) labelled with 113 mIn-diethylenetriaminepenta-acetic acid) mixed meal. A manometric catheter simultaneously measured antral, pyloric, and duodenal motor activity. The liquid component dispersed rapidly throughout <b>the</b> stomach and <b>emptied</b> after a minimal lag period. <b>The</b> <b>emptying</b> of <b>the</b> 25 % dextrose was delayed compared with the saline. This delay was associated with increased retention of <b>the</b> liquid <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distal stomach, {{a significant increase in}} localised phasic pyloric contractions, and a suppression of antral contractions. The solid component initially resided wholly within a proximal stomach reservoir area. Solids then redistributed from proximal to distal stomach during <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of liquid from the stomach. Dextrose delayed gastric emptying of solids compared with saline by increasing the solid lag period and retention <b>in</b> <b>the</b> proximal stomach. There {{was no significant difference between}} saline and dextrose meals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distal stomach retention of solid or <b>in</b> <b>the</b> linear rate of <b>emptying</b> after <b>the</b> lag period. We conclude that, contrary to general opinion, {{the proximal}} stomach plays an important role <b>in</b> <b>the</b> control of gastric emptying of solids while the distal stomach is important <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>emptying</b> of nutrient liquids...|$|R
