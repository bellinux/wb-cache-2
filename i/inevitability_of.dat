Durkheim, Marx, and Weber are more typically {{cited as the}} fathers of contemporary social science. In psychology, a positivistic approach has historically been favoured in behaviourism.

5|$|Reagan's {{campaign}} {{relied on}} a strategy crafted by campaign manager John Sears of winning a few primaries early to damage the <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> Ford's likely nomination. Reagan won North Carolina, Texas, and California, but the strategy failed, as he ended up losing New Hampshire, Florida, and his native Illinois. The Texas campaign lent renewed hope to Reagan, when he swept all 96 delegates chosen in the May 1 primary, with four more awaiting at the state convention. Much {{of the credit for}} that victory came from the work of three co-chairmen, including Ernest Angelo, the mayor of Midland, and Ray Barnhart of Houston, whom Reagan as President would appoint in 1981 as director of the Federal Highway Administration.|$|E
5|$|The {{assumption}} of imperial titles by Zenobia signaled a usurpation: independence from, and open rebellion against, Aurelian. The timeline {{of events and}} why Zenobia declared herself empress is vague. In {{the second half of}} 271, Aurelian marched to the East, but was delayed by the Goths in the Balkans; this may have alarmed the queen, driving her to claim the imperial title. Zenobia also probably understood the <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> open conflict with Aurelian, and decided that feigning subordination would be useless; her {{assumption of}} the imperial title was used to rally soldiers to her cause. Aurelian's campaign seems to have been the main reason for the Palmyrene imperial declaration and the removal of his portrait from its coins.|$|E

5|$|While not portraying Akira sympathetically, {{the film}} does offer a socio-political {{view on the}} origins and <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> such {{criminal}} types in society. The tenements in which the youths reside are depicted as inhospitable and sterile. Lacking education, proper role models and moral codes, critic Bryan Hartzheim posited, crime and base pleasures are their most open recourse. They seem aware of the injustices in their environments and rail against society at large. However, Akira is illustrated as being capable of innocent pleasure, particularly in one fleeting scene in which he and his black friend Gil (Chico Rolands), whom he views as a fellow outcast, frolic in the ocean.|$|E
5|$|At its 2010 {{summit in}} Seoul, South Korea, the G-20 collectively {{endorsed}} a new collection of capital adequacy and liquidity standards for banks recommended by Basel III. Andreas Dombret of the Executive Board of Deutsche Bundesbank has noted a difficulty in identifying institutions that constitute systemic importance via their size, complexity, {{and degree of}} interconnectivity within the global financial system, and that efforts {{should be made to}} identify a group of 25 to 30 indisputable globally systemic institutions. He has suggested they be held to standards higher than those mandated by Basel III, and that despite the <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> institutional failures, such failures should not drag with them the financial systems in which they participate. Dombret has advocated for regulatory reform that extends beyond banking regulations and has argued in favor of greater transparency through increased public disclosure and increased regulation of the shadow banking system.|$|E

40|$|This {{essay is}} an {{exploration}} {{into the social}} <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> culture shifts within the American Muslim community’s self-understanding of their faith. Rather than a theological explication {{of the reasons why}} and why not Islam may or can or will not assimilate in America, our approach will be strictly sociological thereby side-stepping the intricate dialectic of theological niceties in deference to the social realities of culture change. As a social psychologist, my duty is to acknowledge the <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> behavioral shifts brought about due to social and cultural pressures resulting from immigration into an alien cultural weltanschauung, i. e., worldview. Therefore in this essay, we will explicate the meaning and nature of de-ethnicization and re-enculturation as we endeavor to disentangle religion from culture, recognizing that much of what goes under the flag of religious orthodoxy is really culturally-mandated behavior and worldview. The assimilation process, however, will bear heavily upon the necessity for Muslim clergy in America to become professional by Western standards and we will in the process explore the complexities of religious secularism as a way of becoming an “American” Muslim. Finally, we will suggest liturgical and architectural “adjustments” to Western modes of public worship while indicating linguistic niceties which will prove helpful in the assimilation process which we have chosen here to call the “Islamicization of America”...|$|R

25|$|The idea {{of working}} with the middle-class Liberal Party to achieve working-class {{representation}} in parliament was not universally accepted, however. Marxist socialists, believing in the <b>inevitability</b> <b>of</b> class struggle between the working-class and the capitalist class, rejected the idea of workers making common cause with the petty bourgeois Liberals in exchange for scraps of charity from the legislative table.

40|$|Arguments abound as {{to whether}} {{information}} and communication technolo-gies (ICTs) can beneªcially shape socioeconomic development and micro-enterprise, whether they are appropriate to local culture, and whether they ªt with the development approach in use. This paper uses participative action re-search to explore the impact of network translations on the actor-network of a South African rural women’s development organization. One of the three translations considered is the introduction of ICTs through a government-sponsored telecenter; in this case, inserted into a complex socio-political con-text among a myriad of actors and actor-networks. The due process model is applied to this translation to show the neglect of institutionalization factors. Using Actor-Network Theory to trace translation trajectories captures the ef-fects of the inescapable “openness ” of actor-networks, effects {{that lead to the}} <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> unanticipated consequences, which result in “messes overºowing the frames constructed to contain them. ...|$|R
40|$|Geographers have {{recently}} begun {{to pay more attention}} to the conceptualisation of time in both their theory and their empirical method. In the spirit of furthering this endeavour within the field of economic geography, I identify a number of key problems which I contend must be addressed to make an adequate treatment of time possible. These concern the infatuation with static equilibrium, common presumptions <b>of</b> <b>inevitability,</b> caricatures <b>of</b> fixed capital and technological change, and a general failure to incorporate uncertainty and adjustment strategies into spatial analysis. Discussion of these problems is followed by an attempt to offer a revised motion of tradition, as an important element in a truly dynamic economic geography. ...|$|R

40|$|Sustainability {{assessment}} {{is a recent}} framing of impact assessment that places emphasis on delivering positive net sustainability gains now and into the future. It can be directed to any type of decision-making, can take many forms and is fundamentally pluralistic. Drawing mainly on theoretical papers along with the few case study examples published to date (from England, Western Australia, South Africa and Canada), this paper outlines what might be considered state-of-the-art sustainability assessment. Such processes must: (i) address sustainability imperatives with positive progress towards sustainability; (ii) establish a workable concept of sustainability {{in the context of}} individual decisions/assessments; (iii) adopt formal mechanisms for managing unavoidable trade-offs in an open, participative and accountable manner; (iv) embrace the pluralistic <b>inevitabilities</b> <b>of</b> sustainability assessment, and (v) engender learning throughout.
