5|$|In the 35 {{years between}} the time of Chandler's {{reorganization}} and the election of Wendell H.

Ford continued merging <b>departments</b> and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent that, {{by the end of}} the year, there were only three program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection and Regulation) and four additional <b>departments</b> (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).|$|E
