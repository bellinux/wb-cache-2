50|$|Insulated neighborhoods aid in {{identifying}} the target genes of disease-associated enhancer variants. The majority of disease-linked <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> identified from genome-wide association studies occur in enhancers. Identifying target genes of enhancers with disease-linked variants has been difficult because enhancers may act over long distances, but the constraint on enhancer-gene targeting by insulated neighborhoods refines the prediction of target genes. For example, a DNA variant associated with type 2 diabetes occurs within an enhancer located between the CDC123 and CAMK1D genes but only affects CAMK1D because this gene and the enhancer are within the same insulated neighborhood, while CDC123 lies outside the neighborhood.|$|E

50|$|With {{the advent}} of {{next-generation}} sequencing we are obtaining enough sequence data to map the genes of complex diseases such as diabetes, infertility, breast cancer or Alzheimer's Disease. Genome-wide association studies are a useful approach to pinpoint the mutations responsible for such complex diseases.

50|$|The {{canonical}} {{structure of}} DNA has four bases: thymine (T), adenine (A), cytosine (C), and guanine (G). DNA sequencing is {{the determination of}} the physical order of these bases in a molecule of DNA. However, there are many other bases that may be present in a molecule. In some viruses (specifically, bacteriophage), cytosine may be replaced by hydroxy methyl or hydroxy methyl glucose cytosine. In mammalian <b>DNA,</b> <b>variant</b> bases with methyl groups or phosphosulfate may be found. Depending on the sequencing technique, a particular modification, e.g., the 5mC (5 methyl cytosine) common in humans, {{may or may not be}} detected.|$|R
50|$|The Human Genome Bi-Allelic SEquence (HGBASE) {{database}} was {{the first}} version of what is now GWAS Central. It was first released in August 1998, focusing on providing a centralized collection of known human single nucleotide polymorphisms and other simple <b>DNA</b> <b>variants.</b> It {{was the first}} publicly available SNP database. The project was expanded over the next year by a consortium including the Karolinska Institute, the European Bioinformatics Institute and the European Molecular Biology Laboratory. Corporate support was provided by Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline. The version released in November 2001 was renamed the Human Genome Variation database (HGVbase), as this was a better reflection of the scope of the database and its emphasis on collection from many different laboratories. In addition this also highlighted its new role as a central repository for data collection efforts in collaboration with the Human Genome Variation Society.|$|E
50|$|Mapping eQTLs is done using {{standard}} QTL mapping {{methods that}} test {{the linkage between}} variation in expression and genetic polymorphisms. The only considerable difference is that eQTL studies can involve a million or more expression microtraits. Standard gene mapping software packages can be used, although it is often faster to use custom code such as QTL Reaper or the web-based eQTL mapping system GeneNetwork. GeneNetwork hosts many large eQTL mapping data sets and provide access to fast algorithms to map single loci and epistatic interactions. As is true in all QTL mapping studies, the final steps in defining <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> that cause variation in traits are usually difficult and require {{a second round of}} experimentation. This is especially the case for trans eQTLs that do not benefit from the strong prior probability that relevant variants are in the immediate vicinity of the parent gene. Statistical, graphical, and bioinformatic methods are used to evaluate positional candidate genes and entire systems of interactions.|$|E
50|$|Sklar’s {{research}} and clinical work focus on characterizing the biology underlying mental illnesses, in particular schizophrenia and bipolar disorder. Her studies of DNA variation have identified both common and rare genetic changes {{associated with these}} disorders. While working at the Broad Institute, Sklar co-founded the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research and served as its genetics director. By studying thousands of affected individuals and comparing them with thousands of healthy people, {{she was the first}} to associate recurrent large deletions of DNA with the onset of schizophrenia and also found the first broadly reproducible genetic variants in schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder using genome-wide association studies. Sklar and her colleagues discovered a molecular basis for polygenicity in schizophrenia among both rare and common DNA alterations and that schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are genetically linked through <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> that contribute to both illnesses. In 2011, Sklar joined the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and became founding chief of the Division of Psychiatric Genomics there. The division’s scope includes stem cell biology, neurocognition, statistical genetics, and imaging approaches to elucidate the biological variation causing mental illness. While at Mount Sinai, Sklar published papers demonstrating that schizophrenia is linked to many ultra-rare genetic variants. Sklar serves as a principal investigator for the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium, the largest international collaboration in the psychiatric community. She has helped lead the consortium’s working group on bipolar disorder. She also co-founded the International Schizophrenia Consortium.|$|E

40|$|The DNA of 48 {{strains of}} {{adenovirus}} type 40 (Ad 40) and of 128 strains of adenovirus type 41 (Ad 41), isolated between 1971 and 1986 from various countries, {{was characterized by}} restriction enzyme analysis using nine and ten restriction endonucleases respectively. Five new <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> of Ad 40 and 18 new <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> of Ad 41 were detected. Most of the restriction sites which differed among the various <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> appeared to be distributed at random over {{the entire length of}} the viral genomes of the two serotypes. The number of restriction sites by which two <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> differed from each other was used as a measure of their relatedness. Several clusters of closely related <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> were observed for each of the two serotypes. The 35 <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> of Ad 40 and Ad 41 were used to test monoclonal antibody preparations for their range of reactivity in a neutralization assay. One monoclonal antibody (5 - 8), raised against Ad 40 strain Dugan, showed type-specific neutralization of all 11 Ad 40 <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> tested. Six monoclonal antibodies, raised against Ad 41 strain Tak, neutralized different proportions of the variants of Ad 41. Two of these preparations (1 - 21 and 3 - 19) neutralized all 24 Ad 41 <b>DNA</b> <b>variants,</b> while a third (1 - 23) reacted with only 12 Ad 41 variants. Three other monoclonal antibody preparations (3 - 10, 3 - 18, 7 - 14) reacted specifically with only 6 of these 12 variants. The patterns of reactivity with the monoclonal antibody preparations correlated with the presence or absence of a HindIII restriction site at 56 map units and of an EcoRI restriction site at 52 map units on the Ad 41 DNA.

40|$|AbstractThis work probes {{the mystery}} of what balance of forces creates the {{extraordinary}} mechanical stiffness of DNA to bending and twisting. Here we explore the relationship between base stacking, functional group occupancy of the DNA minor and major grooves, and DNA mechanical properties. We study double-helical DNA molecules substituting either inosine for guanosine or 2, 6 -diaminopurine for adenine. These <b>DNA</b> <b>variants,</b> respectively, remove or add an amino group from the DNA minor groove, with corresponding changes in hydrogen-bonding and base stacking energy. Using the techniques of ligase-catalyzed cyclization kinetics, atomic force microscopy, and force spectroscopy with optical tweezers, we show that these <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> have bending persistence lengths {{within the range of}} values reported for sequence-dependent variation of the natural DNA bases. Comparison with seven additional <b>DNA</b> <b>variants</b> that modify the DNA major groove reveals that DNA bending stiffness is not correlated with base stacking energy or groove occupancy.
