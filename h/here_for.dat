5|$|When {{the club}} was first founded, Christ Church had a nomadic existence, playing {{at a number of}} {{locations}} in the area. The club, which had by then been renamed Bolton Wanderers, started playing regularly at Pike's Lane in 1881. Spending £150 on pitch improvements, season tickets cost a guinea. They played <b>here</b> <b>for</b> fourteen years until the tenancy expired and they moved to Burnden Park.|$|E
5|$|At Kilve are {{the remains}} of a red brick retort, built in 1924, when it was {{discovered}} that the shale found in the cliffs was rich in oil. The beach is part of the Blue Anchor to Lilstock Coast SSSI (Site of Special Scientific Interest). Along this coast the cliffs are layered with compressed strata of oil-bearing shale and blue, yellow and brown lias embedded with fossils. In 1924 Forbes-Leslie founded the Shaline Company to exploit them. This retort house is thought to be the first structure erected <b>here</b> <b>for</b> the conversion of shale to oil but the company was unable to raise sufficient capital and this is now all that remains of the anticipated Somerset oil boom.|$|E

The 33rd Armoured Division of Indian Army is stationed at Hisar and {{is a part of}} I Corps.

5|$|In 1669, the Jewel House was {{demolished}} and the Crown Jewels {{moved into}} Martin Tower (until 1841). They were displayed <b>here</b> <b>for</b> viewing by the paying public. This was exploited {{two years later}} when Colonel Thomas Blood attempted to steal them. Blood and his accomplices bound and gagged the Jewel House keeper. Although they laid {{their hands on the}} Imperial State Crown, Sceptre and Orb, they were foiled when the keeper's son turned up unexpectedly and raised the alarm.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the minor themes in the B strain, the third section is upbeat but with bittersweet harmonies, returning once again to the scale of B-flat major. <b>Here,</b> <b>for</b> the first time, the piece departs from the standard left-hand pattern that characterizes most ragtime. This section of the piece {{has been compared to}} the style of twelve bar blues. The C strain also represents the only known time when Joplin departs from the standard sixteen-bar form, being instead 24 bars in length with an uneven 14- and 10-bar division. Its first 12 measures parallel the 12-bar blues form and the next two measures extend the subdominant as a transition into the last ten bars.|$|E

5|$|That Ouania is Govan is now {{reasonably}} certain, but {{the location}} of Newanbirig is less so. Although there are very many Newburghs, it is Newburgh-on-Tyne near Hexham {{that has been the}} preferred location. An alternative interpretation of the events of 756 has been advanced: it identifies Newanbirig with Newborough by Lichfield in the kingdom of Mercia. A defeat <b>here</b> <b>for</b> Eadberht and Óengus by Æthelbald's Mercians would correspond with the claim in the Saint Andrews foundation legends that a king named Óengus son of Fergus founded the church there as a thanksgiving to Saint Andrew for saving him after a defeat in Mercia.|$|E
5|$|The {{journey through}} Switzerland continued, with concerts at Lausanne and Zurich. Since leaving the Netherlands, Wolfgang had {{composed}} little; a minor harpsichord piece, K. 33B, {{written for the}} Zürich concerts, and later some cello pieces (since lost) written for the Prince of Fürstenberg. The prince received the party on 20 October, on its arrival in Donaueschingen on the German border, for a stay of some 12 days. Resuming their journey, they reached Munich on 8 November. They were delayed <b>here</b> <b>for</b> nearly two weeks after Wolfgang fell ill, but he was well enough to perform before the Elector, with Nannerl, on 22 November. A few days later they set out for Salzburg, arriving at their home on the Getreidegasse on 29 November 1766.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrates court}} {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried <b>here</b> <b>for</b> attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried here again in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E
