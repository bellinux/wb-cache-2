40|$|The {{effects of}} grading on the {{performance}} of heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs) are studied by numerically solving the basic semiconductor equations. The numerical modelling is based on the extended drift-diffusion formulation with inclusion of thermionic emission current at the heterointerface of abrupt emitter HBTs. The results of the simulation show that the graded layer improves significantly the current driving capability of the HBT and lowers its offset voltage. However, owing to the increase in the recombination in the graded layer, the current gain of the graded HBT is lower and depends strongly on the bias at low and medium bias range. The simulation also reveals the presence of a potential minimum in the conduction band of the graded emitter HBT, which results in an electron accumulation in the region. This accumulation increases the <b>emitter-base</b> <b>capacitance</b> and its charging time, leading to a smaller unity-gain frequency fT...|$|E
40|$|Abstract-The {{junction}} space-charge-region capacitances are of pri-mary {{importance for}} high-speed VLSI bipolar circuit modeling. It {{is shown in}} the above paper that the <b>emitter-base</b> junction <b>capacitance</b> model is compact and is in excellent agreement when compared with other relatively complicated models and methods. However, the hase-collector junction capacitance model is questionable {{in the sense that the}} base-collector junction capacitance becomes more important, rather than being negligible, as suggested by Stiibing and Rein, in the high current region.
