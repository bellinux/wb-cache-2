30|$|Conclusion Nosocomial {{bacterial}} <b>infections</b> <b>are</b> {{dominated by}} pneumonia and central catheter <b>infections,</b> and <b>are</b> mainly due to BGN. The {{factors associated with}} these <b>infections</b> <b>were</b> identified.|$|R
50|$|Once an <b>infection</b> has <b>been</b> {{diagnosed}} and identified, suitable {{treatment options}} must be {{assessed by the}} physician and consulting medical microbiologists. Some <b>infections</b> can <b>be</b> dealt with by the body's own immune system, but more serious <b>infections</b> <b>are</b> treated with antimicrobial drugs. Bacterial <b>infections</b> <b>are</b> treated with antibacterials (often called antibiotics) whereas fungal and viral <b>infections</b> <b>are</b> treated with antifungals and antivirals respectively. A broad class of drugs known as antiparasitics are used to treat parasitic diseases.|$|R

5|$|Air can {{be trapped}} {{under the skin}} in necrotizing infections such as gangrene, {{occurring}} as a late sign in gas gangrene, {{of which it is}} the hallmark sign. Subcutaneous emphysema is also considered a hallmark of fournier gangrene. Symptoms of subcutaneous emphysema can result when infectious organisms produce gas by fermentation. When emphysema occurs due to infection, signs that the <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> systemic, i.e. that it has spread beyond the initial location, are also present.|$|E
5|$|In most patients, {{the direct}} {{cause for the}} {{cerebral}} sinus thrombosis is not readily apparent. Identifying a source of <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> crucial; it is common practice to screen for various forms of thrombophilia (a propensity to form blood clots).|$|E

5|$|Nucleic acid {{amplification}} tests (NAATs), direct fluorescein tests (DFA), and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA) {{are highly}} sensitive tests that can identify specific pathogens present. Serology testing for antibodies {{is not as}} useful since {{the presence of the}} microorganisms in healthy people can confound interpreting the antibody titer levels, although antibody levels can indicate whether an <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> recent or long-term.|$|E
5|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV) is the virus that – when the <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> not treated – can cause AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). Most virologists believe that HIV originated in sub-Saharan Africa during the 20th century, and over 70 million individuals have been infected by the virus. By 2011, an estimated 35 million had died from AIDS, {{making it one of}} the most destructive epidemics in recorded history.|$|E

5|$|The {{infectious}} disease hepatitis C {{is caused by}} the hepatitis C virus (HCV), which affects the liver and is transmitted by blood-to-blood contact, or by exposure to another person's infected blood. The <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> often asymptomatic, but chronic infection can cause inflammation of the liver (chronic hepatitis). This condition can progress to scarring of the liver (fibrosis), and advanced scarring (cirrhosis). In some cases, those with cirrhosis go on to develop liver failure or liver cancer.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already immunosuppressed (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E
5|$|Viruses (particularly rotavirus) and the {{bacteria}} Escherichia coli and Campylobacter species {{are the primary}} causes of gastroenteritis. There are, however, many other infectious agents that can cause this syndrome. Non-infectious causes are seen on occasion, but {{they are less likely}} than a viral or bacterial cause. Risk of <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> higher in children due to their lack of immunity and relatively poor hygiene.|$|E

40|$|Birth {{characteristics}} and growth pattern in 76 children with congenital cytomegalovirus (CMV) <b>infection</b> <b>were</b> compared to Swedish reference data. <b>Infection</b> classification <b>was</b> based on maternal sera during pregnancy. In 31 children the <b>infection</b> <b>was</b> primary and 31 children had reactivated (recurrent or secondary) congenital CMV infection. Infection type {{could not be}} determined in 14 children. Transient neonatal symptoms were apparent in 22 children and eight children had classical neurological CMV sequelae. Heterogeneous neurological disorders were found in 13 children. No significant differences in height, weight, and growth were found. The median follow-up time was 10 years. From 4 years old children with congenital CMV <b>infection</b> <b>were</b> taller than the reference standard. At 1 and 2 years, those children with primary congenital CMV <b>infection</b> <b>were</b> borderline shorter than reference standard, and from 4 years children with reactivated CMV <b>infection</b> <b>were</b> taller than the reference standard. In conclusion, no evidence was found verifying that congenital CMV infection causes short stature...|$|R
5|$|A cold usually {{begins with}} fatigue, {{a feeling of}} being chilled, sneezing, and a headache, {{followed}} {{in a couple of days}} by a runny nose and cough. Symptoms may begin within sixteen hours of exposure and typically peak two to four days after onset. They usually resolve in seven to ten days, but some can last for up to three weeks. The average duration of cough is eighteen days and in some cases people develop a post-viral cough which can linger after the <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> gone. In children, the cough lasts for more than ten days in 35–40% of cases and continues for more than 25 days in 10%.|$|E
5|$|Consistent {{condom use}} {{reduces the risk}} of HIV {{transmission}} by approximately 80% over the long term. When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected, the rate of HIV <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> less than 1% per year. There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection. Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir (a reverse transcriptase inhibitor) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40% among African women. By contrast, use of the spermicide nonoxynol-9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation.|$|E
5|$|During {{the fifth}} season, the Syndicate {{discovered}} that Covarrubias had betrayed them and was providing information to Mulder. Covarrubias was infected with black oil during her {{betrayal of the}} Syndicate, and Syndicate scientists used her to test a vaccine they had been working to create. While the Syndicate-developed vaccine proves ineffective, Covarrubias' <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> ultimately cured by an effective vaccine stolen from a Russian shadow-government group by Alex Krycek. In the following season, Covarrubias is discovered by FBI agent Jeffrey Spender (Chris Owens) at a decontamination chamber. She begs him to help her escape the facility, addressing him by name as well as giving him information about the whereabouts of his mother, Cassandra. Alex Krycek (Nicholas Lea), a former Syndicate agent now acting alone, is also present at the facility. He declines to help the pair, and leaves Covarrubias for dead.|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{incidence}} of dengue virus (DEN) infections in a cohort of Dutch short-term travellers to endemic areas in Asia during 1991 - 92. Sera were collected before and after travel. All post-travel sera were tested for DEN immunoglobulin M (IgM) [IgM capture (MAC) -enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) ] and IgG (indirect ELISA). Probable DEN <b>infection</b> <b>was</b> defined as IgM seroconversion or a fourfold rise in IgG ratio {{in the absence of}} cross-reaction with antibody to Japanese encephalitis virus (JEV). <b>Infections</b> <b>were</b> considered clinically apparent in case of febrile illness (> 24 H) with headache, myalgia, arthralgia or rash. Probable DEN <b>infection</b> <b>was</b> found in 13 of 447 travellers (incidence rate 30 / 1000 person-months, 95 % CI 17. 4 - 51. 6). One <b>infection</b> <b>was</b> considered secondary; no haemorrhagic fever occurred. The clinical-to-subclinical <b>infection</b> rate <b>was</b> 1 : 3. 3.

5|$|Grasshoppers are {{affected}} by diseases caused by bacteria, viruses, fungi and protozoa. The bacteria Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa have both been implicated in causing disease in grasshoppers, as has the entomopathogenic fungus Beauveria bassiana. This widespread fungus {{has been used to}} control various pest insects around the world, but although it infects grasshoppers, the <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> not usually lethal because basking in the sun has the result of raising the insect's temperature above a threshold tolerated by the fungus. The fungal pathogen Entomophaga grylli is able to influence the behaviour of its grasshopper host, causing it to climb {{to the top of a}} plant and cling to the stem as it dies. This ensures wide dispersal of the fungal spores liberated from the corpse.|$|E
5|$|HIV {{is spread}} {{primarily}} by unprotected sex (including anal and oral sex), contaminated blood transfusions, hypodermic needles, and from mother to child during pregnancy, delivery, or breastfeeding. Some bodily fluids, such as saliva and tears, do not transmit HIV. Methods of prevention include safe sex, needle exchange programs, treating {{those who are}} infected, and male circumcision. Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication. There is no cure or vaccine; however, antiretroviral treatment can slow {{the course of the}} disease and may lead to a near-normal life expectancy. Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made. Without treatment, the average survival time after <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> 11years.|$|E
5|$|In fatal {{cases of}} {{ordinary}} smallpox, death usually occurs between the tenth and sixteenth {{days of the}} illness. The cause of death from smallpox is not clear, but the <b>infection</b> <b>is</b> now known to involve multiple organs. Circulating immune complexes, overwhelming viremia, or an uncontrolled immune response may be contributing factors. In early hemorrhagic smallpox, death occurs suddenly about six days after the fever develops. Cause of death in hemorrhagic cases involved heart failure, sometimes accompanied by pulmonary edema. In late hemorrhagic cases, high and sustained viremia, severe platelet loss and poor immune response were often cited as causes of death. In flat smallpox modes of death {{are similar to those}} in burns, with loss of fluid, protein and electrolytes beyond the capacity of the body to replace or acquire, and fulminating sepsis.|$|E

40|$|A {{one year}} (2009 - 10) {{prevalence}} study on gastrointestinal parasitism {{was conducted in}} crossbred and local cattle, Chittagong,Bangladesh. Fecal samples were collected randomly from 216 crossbred and 432 local cattle of four representative areas in three consecutive seasons. Samples were examined by routine coproscopical methods. The effects of topography,season, age and gender were tested in bothcrossbred and local cattle. The overall prevalence of gastrointestinal parasitic <b>infections</b> <b>was</b> 39. 75 % and 46. 25 % incrossbred and local cattle, respectively. Frequency of trematodes and nematodes <b>infections</b> <b>was</b> persistent in all the study areas. The highest prevalence of trematodes <b>infections</b> <b>was</b> found in Boalkhali (32. 41 %) compared to Noakhali(23. 14 %), Rangunia (18. 53 %) andKhagrachori sadar Upazila (17. 60 %). Prevalence of nematodes <b>infection</b> <b>was</b> the highest (25. 93 %) in Noakhali sadar Upazila in local cattle.
