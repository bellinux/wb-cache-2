5|$|Picking up Goodnight's {{tracking}} signal, Bond flies a seaplane into Red Chinese {{waters and}} lands at Scaramanga's island. Scaramanga welcomes and shows Bond the {{solar power plant}} operation that he has taken over, the technology for which he intends to sell to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> While demonstrating the equipment, Scaramanga uses a powerful energy beam to destroy Bond's plane.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010, Samuelsson posted {{an online}} charity auction for fans in Sweden to benefit minor hockey in Mariefred. The <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> at $6,500, won an all-expenses paid trip {{for two to}} Vancouver, {{featuring}} tickets to two Canucks games at Rogers Arena, access to the team's locker room and a five-night stay in Samuelsson's personal home. Samuelsson has also {{been involved in the}} National Hockey League Players Association (NHLPA)'s Goals and Dreams program, which provides equipment to minor hockey teams around the world, including Mariefred.|$|E
5|$|Ofcom awards {{licenses}} for digital radio services differently {{depending on the}} type of service and the platform. Ofcom advertises the licences of new digital radio ensembles and are subject to an open competition to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Ensemble licence awards are awarded for twelve years. To broadcast a service on a DAB ensemble, a station must hold a Digital Sound Programme Service licence from Ofcom. On digital television services, individual stations can apply for either a digital cable and satellite licence to broadcast on the aforementioned platforms, or apply for a digital terrestrial licence to broadcast on digital terrestrial television.|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} a lower <b>bidder</b> and a <b>higher</b> <b>bidder,</b> the {{rational}} strategy for the lower bidder is to bid zero knowing that it will lose. The <b>higher</b> <b>bidder</b> will bid a value slightly higher and approaches zero {{in order to maximize}} its payoff, in which case the lower bidder has the incentive to outbid the <b>higher</b> <b>bidder</b> to win.|$|R

5|$|The {{potential}} redevelopment of Sembawang Hot Spring into {{a national}} park is currently being explored. The Ministry of Defence (MINDEF) said on 23 April 2016 that it is prepared to return the land occupied by the hot spring to the Singapore Land Authority. MINDEF hopes a public agency such as the National Parks Board (NParks) can take over to improve and maintain the place, while constructing amenities such as toilets and adding more greenery. The ministry added that putting the place under a public agency means the land need not be tendered out to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> and become commercialised.|$|E
5|$|The sale {{of certain}} offices and titles was reintroduced in Eastern Han by Empress Dowager Deng Sui—who reigned as regent from 105–121 AD—to raise {{government}} revenues {{in times of}} severe natural disasters and the widespread rebellion of the Qiang people in western China. The sale of offices became extremely corrupt under the eunuch-dominated government of Emperor Ling of Han (r. 168–189 AD), when many top official posts were sold at the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> instead of being filled by vetted candidates who had taken Imperial examinations or attended the Imperial University.|$|E
5|$|Wife {{selling in}} England {{was a way}} of ending an {{unsatisfactory}} marriage by mutual agreement that probably began in the late 17th century, when divorce was a practical impossibility for all but the very wealthiest. After parading his wife with a halter around her neck, arm, or waist, a husband would publicly auction her to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Wife selling provides the backdrop for Thomas Hardy's novel The Mayor of Casterbridge, in which the central character sells his wife {{at the beginning of the}} story, an act that haunts him for the rest of his life, and ultimately destroys him.|$|E

5|$|A {{scheme to}} {{circumvent}} the settler grants altogether soon emerged. A railroad official hired a surveyor and logger named Stephen A. Douglas Puter to round up people from Portland saloons, and then {{take them to the}} land office where they would register for an O parcel as a settler, and then promptly resell to the railroad for bundling with other plots and resale to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder,</b> typically as much as $40 an acre. In 1904, an investigation by The Oregonian uncovered the scandal, by which time it had grown to such a magnitude that the paper reported that more than 75% of the land sales had violated federal law.|$|E
5|$|As the 1880s progressed, Cope's and Marsh's men faced stiff {{competition}} {{from each other}} and from third parties interested in bones. Professor Alexander Emanuel Agassiz of Harvard sent his own representatives west, while Carlin and Frank Williston formed a bone company to sell fossils to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Reed left and became a sheep herder in 1884, and Marsh's Como quarries yielded little after his departure. Despite these setbacks, Marsh had more operational quarries than Cope at this point of time; Cope, who at the early 1880s had more bones than he could fit in a single house, had fallen behind in the race for dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Bond {{follows the}} {{diamonds}} to a pick-up by Bert Saxby, Whyte's head of security, and then onto a research laboratory owned by Whyte, where {{he finds that}} a satellite is being built by a laser refraction specialist, Professor Dr. Metz. Suspecting Whyte, Bond tries to confront him, but instead meets Blofeld, who captures the agent and explains {{to him that the}} satellite can blow up nuclear missiles. Blofeld admits that he intends to auction it to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Bond escapes and frees the captive Whyte and they establish that Blofeld is using an offshore oil rig as his base. Bond attacks the rig, stopping Blofeld's operation and dispersing his organisation.|$|E
50|$|Each player {{starts with}} {{the same number of}} points, which may be 15. The goal is to get to 0. Each player subtracts the number of tricks taken from his score each hand. However, the <b>high</b> <b>bidder</b> must take at least the number of tricks he bid. If he fails to take this many tricks, instead of {{subtracting}} points, he must add 5 to his score. Therefore, being the <b>high</b> <b>bidder</b> is helpful in that it lets you call trump, but it is also dangerous as you are the only player held to your bid.|$|R
25|$|The <b>highest</b> <b>bidder's</b> bid is sealed, as in a Vickrey auction, but {{the current}} winning bid (second highest plus one increment) is {{displayed}} throughout the auction to allow price discovery.|$|R
5000|$|After all {{the cards}} of the hand have been played, each side adds up the score of the {{captured}} Money cards. Any Money cards in the trick in which the Bull is played count double, and the trick in which the Bear is played is worthless (subject, of course, to the rule regarding the play of both Bull and Bear in the same trick).If the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder's</b> side has captured cards that total or exceed its bid, it scores all it has earned. If the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder's</b> side has failed to earn at least its bid it is [...] "set back" [...] {{the total amount of}} its bid. In other words, having had the privilege of naming trump color, if the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder's</b> side fails to earn its bid, it not only can't score what it earned, but has the bid amount recorded as a negative score (deducted from its current or future earnings). The opposing side, which did not name trump color, retains the total amount it made.|$|R
5|$|The booked service allowed {{two options}} of fees. The Transit Booking System, {{available}} online, allowing customers {{who do not}} want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15% over the regular tolls, guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less. ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance. The second choice was high priority transit. Since 2006, ACP has available a 25th slot, sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships, containerships, vehicle carriers, and non-containerized cargo vessels.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} Class C retail {{licenses}} for bars, restaurants, and liquor stores {{is limited by}} population and often by municipal ordinances. Licenses are typically obtained from existing licensees who choose to sell, or when a new license is offered as a town's population grows. As a result, the price for a retail license is often prohibitively expensive. The sale of a new license is usually conducted by public auction. The intense competition can benefit a town by generating {{several hundred thousand dollars}} of revenue from the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> A 2006 license auction in Cherry Hill, New Jersey set the state record at $1.5 million.|$|E
5|$|A businessman, Blackmer, {{visits the}} reclusive Dr Orchard, a {{scientist}} {{who lives in a}} remote house on the Ambro River in South America. From the local plant Sidonicus americanus, Orchard has developed a food additive called Theramine; if administered to animals, the chemical causes them to grow beyond their original size. Enlargement of animal stock would offer a simple solution to world famine and present other economic advantages. Blackmer's boatman, Culp, eavesdrops on the meeting. After a storm forces Blackmer to stay at the house for the night, Culp resolves to steal the Theramine and sell it to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> Waiting until the other occupants fall asleep, he steals the keys to Orchard's laboratory from the housekeeper, Mrs Files. While filling a vial with a quantity of the chemical, Culp accidentally knocks the rest of the supply into a sink, and the Theramine drains into the Ambro River.|$|E

50|$|In 1830, Pintado's widow {{sold the}} {{exclusive}} file to land speculators in Louisiana, Florida and Missouri. Apparently the American government {{had refused to}} pay the $15,000 she demanded, so she sold them to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidders.</b>|$|R
50|$|In 1964, Lake Accotink was {{declared}} surplus {{and put up}} for auction. The Fairfax County Park Authority was the <b>high</b> <b>bidder,</b> and officially purchased the 242-acre tract, including the 100-acre lake, for $176,500 in April 1965.|$|R
5|$|Meanwhile, Elena is {{kidnapped by}} Roman, and Nate reunites with Sully and follows {{him to the}} statue. Encouraged by Navarro, Roman opens the sarcophagus, exposing himself to an {{airborne}} virus. As he begins to turn, Navarro guns him down and orders his men to secure the statue {{so that he can}} sell the virus to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> on the black market. Nate jumps onto the net carrying the treasure which is connected to the transport chopper while a captive Elena gets the pilot killed, causing it to crash on Navarro's cargo ship. Nate kills the remaining mercenaries and attempts to rescue Elena, only to be attacked by Navarro. After a fistfight, he pulls her out of the chopper and pushes it overboard, taking Navarro, whose leg is tangled in the rope connected to the net, and the statue with it {{to the bottom of the}} sea.|$|E
5|$|The Friday the 13th novella storyline was not {{connected}} to the Jason X series, and did not continue the stories set forth by the films, but furthered the character of Jason in its own way. Friday the 13th: Church of the Divine Psychopath has Jason resurrected by a religious cult. Jason is stuck in Hell, when recently executed serial killer Wayne Sanchez persuades Jason to help him return to Earth in Friday the 13th: Hell Lake. In Hate-Kill-Repeat, two religious serial killers attempt to find Jason at Crystal Lake, believing that {{the three of them}} share the same contempt for those that break the moral code. In The Jason Strain, Jason is on an island with a group of convicts placed there by television executives running a reality game show. The character of Pamela Voorhees returns from the grave in Carnival of Maniacs. Pamela is in search of Jason, who is now part of a traveling sideshow and about to be auctioned off to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b>|$|E
5|$|While {{playing against}} Norwich City on 27 August 2011, Drogba {{suffered}} a concussion in {{a collision with}} Norwich goalkeeper John Ruddy.

Drogba received a red card on 23 October against Queens Park Rangers, Chelsea ended up losing 1–0. On 29 November, Drogba rejected a new deal with Chelsea and was set to sign for the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> On 31 December 2011, Drogba scored his 150th goal for Chelsea against Aston Villa, putting him level with Peter Osgood and Roy Bentley in terms of the club's top scorers of all time.

Bidding ended when one contestant either reached the maximum of eight or challenged the other. If the <b>high</b> <b>bidder</b> successfully completed the bid, he/she won the board. One mistake allowed the opponent a chance to steal the board by giving one of the remaining correct answers still on the board. If the opponent could not do so, the <b>high</b> <b>bidder</b> was given another chance to fulfill his/her bid.|$|R

5|$|By {{the end of}} this era, Rome {{had become}} full of {{unemployed}} Plebeians. They then began filling the ranks of the assemblies, {{and the fact that they}} were no longer away from Rome made it easier for them to vote. In the principle legislative assembly, the Plebeian Council, any individual voted in the Tribe that his ancestors had belonged to. Thus, most of these newly unemployed Plebeians belonged to one of the thirty-one rural Tribes, rather than one of the four urban Tribes, and the unemployed Plebeians soon acquired so much political power that the Plebeian Council became highly populist. These Plebeians were often angry with the aristocracy, which further exacerbated the class tensions. Their economic state usually led them to vote for the candidate who offered the most for them, or at least for the candidate whose games or whose bribes were the most magnificent. The fact that they were usually uninformed as to the issues before them didn't matter, because they usually sold their votes to the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> anyway. Bribery became such a problem that major reforms were ultimately passed, in particular the requirement that all votes be by secret ballot. A new culture of dependency was emerging, which would look to any populist leader for relief.|$|E
5|$|When {{the chorus}} of the song begins, two women pull Gaga out of the bathtub, rip her top {{clothing}} off and force her to drink a glass of vodka. As the second verse begins, Gaga, wearing a diamond-covered outfit topped with a crown, seductively dances {{for a group of}} men bidding for her. She straddles one of the men, played by Slovenian model Jurij Bradač, and performs a lap dance for him. Afterwards, the man raises his bid and becomes the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder</b> for her. When the chorus is played for the third time, Gaga is shown wearing a faux-polar bear hide jacket. She walks towards the man, who is sitting on a bed and unbuttoning his shirt, while drinking a glass of vodka. Gaga has a look of indifference on her face and removes her jacket and sunglasses. Suddenly, the bed spontaneously combusts with the man still sitting on it, and Gaga sings in a sinister way in front of the flames. The video ends with her lying beside a smoldering skeleton, on top of the destroyed bed, covered in ashes. With soot smeared across her body, she calmly smokes a cigarette while her pyrotechnic bra activates.|$|E
5|$|Edward Dalyngrigge was {{a younger}} son and thus {{deprived}} of his father's estates through {{the practice of}} primogeniture, hence {{he had to make}} his own fortunes. By 1378, he owned the manor of Bodiam by marrying into a land-owning family. From 1379 to 1388, Dalyngrigge was a Knight of the Shire for Sussex {{and one of the most}} influential people in the county. By the time he applied to the king for a licence to crenellate (build a castle), the Hundred Years' War had been fought between England and France for nearly 50years. Edward III of England (reigned 1327–1377) pressed his claim for the French throne and secured the territories of Aquitaine and Calais. Dalyngrigge was one of many Englishmen who travelled to France to seek their fortune as members of Free Companies– groups of mercenaries who fought for the <b>highest</b> <b>bidder.</b> He left for France in 1367 and journeyed with Lionel, Duke of Clarence and son of Edward III. After fighting under the Earl of Arundel, Dalyngrigge joined the company of Sir Robert Knolles, a notorious commander who was reputed to have made 100,000gold crowns as a mercenary from pillage and plunder. It was as a member of the Free Companies that Dalyngrigge raised the money to build Bodiam Castle; he returned to England in 1377.|$|E
