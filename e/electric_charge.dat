5|$|Every atom is {{composed}} of a nucleus and one or more electrons bound to the nucleus. The nucleus is made {{of one or more}} protons and typically a similar number of neutrons. Protons and neutrons are called nucleons. More than 99.94% of an atom's mass is in the nucleus. The protons have a positive <b>electric</b> <b>charge,</b> the electrons have a negative <b>electric</b> <b>charge,</b> and the neutrons have no <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> If the number of protons and electrons are equal, that atom is electrically neutral. If an atom has more or fewer electrons than protons, then it has an overall negative or positive charge, respectively, and it is called an ion.|$|E

5|$|If a {{body has}} more or fewer {{electrons}} than {{are required to}} balance the positive charge of the nuclei, then that object has a net <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> When there is an excess of electrons, the object {{is said to be}} negatively charged. When there are fewer electrons than the number of protons in nuclei, the object is said to be positively charged. When the number of electrons and the number of protons are equal, their charges cancel each other and the object is said to be electrically neutral. A macroscopic body can develop an <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> through rubbing, by the triboelectric effect.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of an <b>electric</b> <b>charge,</b> which can be either positive or negative, produces an electric field. On the other hand, the movement of electric charges, which is known as electric current, produces a magnetic field.|$|E

25|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>charges</b> are {{the sources}} of, and create, {{electric}} fields. An electric field {{is a field}} which exerts a force on any particles that carry <b>electric</b> <b>charges,</b> {{at any point in}} space. This includes the electron, proton, and even quarks, among others. As a force is exerted, <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> move, a current flows and a magnetic field is produced. The changing magnetic field, in turn causes electric current (often moving electrons). The physical description of interacting charged particles, electrical currents, electrical fields, and magnetic fields is called electromagnetism.|$|R
50|$|The allowed {{charges of}} dyons are {{restricted}} by the Dirac quantization condition. This states {{in particular that}} their magnetic charge must be integral, and that their <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> must all be equal modulo 1. The Witten effect, demonstrated by Edward Witten in his 1979 paper, states that the <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> of dyons must all be equal, modulo one, to the product of their magnetic charge and the theta angle of the theory. In particular, if a theory does not preserve CP symmetry then the <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> of all dyons are integers.|$|R
40|$|In work on {{the basis}} of static model of a {{structure}} of atoms it is shown that the gravitational and electrostatic interactions have the same nature. The electrostatic interaction is the interaction of <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> at small distances, whereas the gravitational interaction is the interaction of <b>electric</b> <b>charges</b> at large distances...|$|R
5|$|Machines that {{generated}} static electricity {{with a glass}} disc were popular and widespread in Europe by 1740. In 1745, German cleric Ewald Georg von Kleist and Dutch scientist Pieter van Musschenbroek discovered independently that the <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> from these machines could be stored in a Leyden jar, named after the city of Leiden in the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|Measurements of the {{interaction}} between energetic photons and hadrons show that {{the interaction}} is much more intense than expected by the interaction of merely photons with the hadron's <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> Furthermore, the interaction of energetic photons with protons is similar to the interaction of photons with neutrons {{in spite of the fact}} that the <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> structures of protons and neutrons are substantially different. A theory called Vector Meson Dominance (VMD) was developed to explain this effect. According to VMD, the photon is a superposition of the pure electromagnetic photon which interacts only with electric charges and vector meson. However, if experimentally probed at very short distances, the intrinsic structure of the photon is recognized as a flux of quark and gluon components, quasi-free according to asymptotic freedom in QCD and described by the photon structure function. A comprehensive comparison of data with theoretical predictions was presented in a review in 2000.|$|E

5|$|Study {{has shown}} that the origin of charge is from certain types of {{subatomic}} particles which have the property of <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> <b>Electric</b> <b>charge</b> gives rise to and interacts with the electromagnetic force, one of the four fundamental forces of nature. The most familiar carriers of electrical charge are the electron and proton. Experiment has shown charge to be a conserved quantity, that is, the net charge within an isolated system will always remain constant regardless of any changes taking place within that system. Within the system, charge may be transferred between bodies, either by direct contact, or by passing along a conducting material, such as a wire. The informal term static electricity refers to the net presence (or 'imbalance') of charge on a body, usually caused when dissimilar materials are rubbed together, transferring charge from one to the other.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} accurate {{method to}} measure {{the value of the}} Avogadro constant was based on coulometry. The principle is {{to measure the}} Faraday constant, F, which is the <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> carried by one mole of electrons, and to divide by the elementary charge, e, to obtain the Avogadro constant.|$|E
5|$|The {{movement}} of <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> {{is known as}} an electric current, the intensity of which is usually measured in amperes.

5|$|Franklin {{realized}} that wooden buildings could {{be protected from}} lightning strikes, and the deadly fires that often resulted, by placing a pointed iron on a rooftop, with {{the other end of}} the rod placed deep into the ground. The sharp point of the lightning rod would attract the electrical discharge from the cloud, and the lightning bolt would hit the iron rod instead of the wooden building. The <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> from the lightning would flow through the rod directly into the earth, bypassing the structure, and preventing a fire.|$|E
5|$|Having <b>electric</b> <b>charge,</b> mass, color charge, and flavor, quarks are {{the only}} known {{elementary}} particles that engage in all four fundamental interactions of contemporary physics: electromagnetism, gravitation, strong interaction, and weak interaction. Gravitation is too weak to be relevant to individual particle interactions except at extremes of energy (Planck energy) and distance scales (Planck distance). However, since no successful quantum theory of gravity exists, gravitation is not described by the Standard Model.|$|E
5|$|In the Standard Model of physics, {{electrons}} {{are truly}} elementary particles with no internal structure. However, both protons and neutrons are composite particles composed of elementary particles called quarks. There {{are two types}} of quarks in atoms, each having a fractional <b>electric</b> <b>charge.</b> Protons are composed of two up quarks (each with charge +) and one down quark (with a charge of −). Neutrons consist of one up quark and two down quarks. This distinction accounts for the difference in mass and charge between the two particles.|$|E

5|$|The {{planetary}} {{model of}} the atom had two significant shortcomings. The first is that, unlike planets orbiting a sun, electrons are charged particles. An accelerating <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> is known to emit electromagnetic waves according to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism. An orbiting charge should steadily lose energy and spiral toward the nucleus, colliding with it in {{a small fraction of}} a second. The second problem was that the planetary model could not explain the highly peaked emission and absorption spectra of atoms that were observed.|$|E
5|$|An atom can be ionized by {{removing}} {{one of its}} electrons. The <b>electric</b> <b>charge</b> causes the trajectory of an atom to bend when it passes through a magnetic field. The radius by which the trajectory of a moving ion is turned by the magnetic field {{is determined by the}} mass of the atom. The mass spectrometer uses this principle to measure the mass-to-charge ratio of ions. If a sample contains multiple isotopes, the mass spectrometer can determine the proportion of each isotope in the sample by measuring the intensity of the different beams of ions. Techniques to vaporize atoms include inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy and inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry, both of which use a plasma to vaporize samples for analysis.|$|E
5|$|In January 1934, Irène Joliot-Curie and Frédéric Joliot {{announced}} that they had bombarded elements with alpha particles and induced radioactivity in them. By March, Fermi's assistant Gian-Carlo Wick had provided a theoretical explanation using Fermi's theory of beta decay. Fermi decided to switch to experimental physics, using the neutron, which James Chadwick had discovered in 1932. In March 1934, Fermi {{wanted to see if}} he could induce radioactivity with Rasetti's polonium-beryllium neutron source. Neutrons had no <b>electric</b> <b>charge,</b> and so would not be deflected by the positively charged nucleus. This meant that they needed much less energy to penetrate the nucleus than charged particles, and so would not require a particle accelerator, which the Via Panisperna boys did not have.|$|E
