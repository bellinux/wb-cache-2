50|$|The Sherman trap is a box-style animal trap {{designed}} for the live capture of small mammals. It was invented by Dr. H. B. Sherman in the 1920s and became commercially available in 1955. Since that time, the Sherman trap has been used extensively by researchers in the biological sciences for capturing animals such as mice, voles, shrews, and chipmunks. The Sherman trap consists <b>of</b> eight <b>hinged</b> pieces <b>of</b> sheet <b>metal</b> (either galvanized steel or aluminum) that allow the trap to be collapsed for storage or transport. Sherman traps are often set in grids and may be baited with grains and seed.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that a global bending {{collapse}} <b>hinge</b> <b>of</b> thin-walled square <b>metal</b> tubes composed with a series <b>of</b> stationary <b>hinge</b> lines, rolling hinge lines and toroidal surfaces. In particular they have shown that the structures respond to quasi-static testing by means of an initial peak moment followed by a falling moment as deformation proceeds. This paper further studies, using finite element analysis, the bending collapse mechanism <b>of</b> thin-walled square <b>metal</b> tubes with a global hinge. Various finite element models are created with ABAQUS. Detailed numerical calculations are made in terms of the resultant moment-rotation curves, the overall collapse process, development <b>of</b> plastic <b>hinge</b> lines, profiles <b>of</b> the cross-section and distributions of stress and strain along the cross-section. Dimensional analysis theory reveals that the bending moment, M, depends on the ratio of width to thickness of the tube (b/t), the flow stress of the material (s 0) and the corresponding rotation angle (?). An empirical design formula for the bending moment is presented and compared with available test results. Finally, the strain-rate effect of the material is investigated for dynamic bending collapse of tubes...|$|R
50|$|As {{in all of}} medicine, {{the main}} tools of {{diagnosis}} are clinical history and examination. Gynaecological examination is quite intimate, more so than a routine physical exam. It also requires unique instrumentation such as the speculum. The speculum consists <b>of</b> two <b>hinged</b> blades <b>of</b> concave <b>metal</b> or plastic which are used to retract the tissues of the vagina and permit examination of the cervix, {{the lower part of}} the uterus located within the upper portion of the vagina. Gynaecologists typically do a bimanual examination (one hand on the abdomen and one or two fingers in the vagina) to palpate the cervix, uterus, ovaries and bony pelvis. It is not uncommon to do a rectovaginal examination for complete evaluation of the pelvis, particularly if any suspicious masses are appreciated. Male gynaecologists may have a female chaperone for their examination. An abdominal or vaginal ultrasound can be used to confirm any abnormalities appreciated with the bimanual examination or when indicated by the patient's history.|$|R
