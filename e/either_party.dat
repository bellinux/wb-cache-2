5000|$|At {{the time}} Adolf Hitler was {{demanding}} the cession {{of the port}} of Danzig, an extraterritorial highway (the Reichsautobahn Berlin-Königsberg) across the Polish Corridor, and special privileges for the German minority within Poland. By {{the terms of the}} military alliance, each party (i.e. Poland and Britain) was free to decide whether to oppose with force any territorial encroachment, as the pact did not include any statement of <b>either</b> <b>party's</b> commitment to the defence of the other party's territorial integrity. The Pact did contain provisions regarding [...] "indirect threats" [...] and attempts to undermine <b>either</b> <b>party's</b> independence by means of [...] "economic penetration", a clear reference to the peculiar status of Danzig. Fearing all-out German invasion no matter what, Poland rejected the German demands.|$|R
5|$|This {{solution}} was not ideal to <b>either</b> <b>party,</b> and further conflict was inevitable. On 30December, at the Battle of Wakefield, York was killed, as were York's second son Edmund, Earl of Rutland, and Warwick's younger brother Thomas. Salisbury was executed a day later. Warwick marched north {{to confront the}} enemy, but was defeated and forced to flee at the Second Battle of St Albans.

On the way to a match at Aldershot on 25 February, Gannon left the team bus after an apparent bust-up with Horsfield. The national media reported that Gannon granted Horsfield's request for a day off for family reasons but then wrote to the board complaining about his conduct. Having been shown the letter by a director, Horsfield confronted Gannon over the issue. After an internal inquiry, during which Horsfield stayed away from the club, no disciplinary action was taken against <b>either</b> <b>party.</b> Gannon was sacked on 21 March, and Grew was appointed as caretaker-manager with Horsfield as his assistant.|$|E

5|$|The {{gameplay}} in {{the series}} has become notable for its high difficulty, along with several mechanics that have endured through the years. A key element present since the first Megami Tensei {{is the ability to}} recruit demons to fight alongside the player in battle, alongside the ability to fuse two different demons together to create a more powerful demon. Equivalents to these systems appear in the later Persona titles. The game's most recognizable battle system is the Press Turn system, first introduced in Nocturne. The Press Turn System is a turn-based battle mechanic governing both the player party and enemies, where <b>either</b> <b>party</b> are rewarded an extra turn for striking an enemy's weakness. A Moon Phase System or equivalent, in which phases of the moon or changes in the weather affected the behavior of enemies, is also featured in multiple games.|$|E
5|$|After {{the battle}} the British forces under general Pritzler pursued the Peshwa, who fled southwards towards Karnataka with the Raja of Satara. The Peshwa {{continued}} his flight southward throughout {{the month of}} January. Not receiving support from the Raja of Mysore, the Peshwa doubled back and passed General Pritzler to head towards Solapur. Until 29 January {{the pursuit of the}} Peshwa had not been productive. Whenever Baji Rao was pressed by the British, Gokhale and his light troops hovered around the Peshwa and fired long shots. Some skirmishes took place, and the Marathas were frequently hit by shells from the horse artillery. There was, however, no advantageous result to <b>either</b> <b>party.</b> On 7 February General Smith entered Satara and captured the royal palace of the Marathas. He symbolically raised the British flag. The next day, the Bhagwa Zenda —the flag of Shivaji and the Marathas— was raised in its place. To gain the support of the population, the British declared that they would not interfere with the tenets of any religion. They announced that all Watans, Inams, pensions, and annual allowances would be continued provided that the recipients withdrew from the service of Baji Rao. During this time Baji Rao remained in the vicinity of Solapur.|$|E

5|$|In the 1890s, the University of Chicago, {{fearful that}} its vast {{resources}} would injure smaller schools by drawing away good students, affiliated with several regional colleges and universities: Des Moines College, Kalamazoo College, Butler University, and Stetson University. In 1896, the university affiliated with Shimer College in Mount Carroll, Illinois. Under {{the terms of}} the affiliation, the schools were required to have courses of study comparable to those at the university, to notify the university early of any contemplated faculty appointments or dismissals, to make no faculty appointment without the university's approval, and to send copies of examinations for suggestions. The University of Chicago agreed to confer a degree on any graduating senior from an affiliated school who made a grade of A for all four years, and on any other graduate who took twelve weeks additional study at the University of Chicago. A student or faculty member of an affiliated school was entitled to free tuition at the University of Chicago, and Chicago students were eligible to attend an affiliated school on the same terms and receive credit for their work. The University of Chicago also agreed to provide affiliated schools with books and scientific apparatus and supplies at cost; special instructors and lecturers without cost except travel expenses; and a copy of every book and journal published by the University of Chicago Press at no cost. The agreement provided that <b>either</b> <b>party</b> could terminate the affiliation on proper notice. Several University of Chicago professors disliked the program, as it involved uncompensated additional labor on their part, and they believed it cheapened the academic reputation of the university. The program passed into history by 1910.|$|E
