500|$|The {{player is}} able to speak to demons instead of {{fighting}} them, and can try to form an alliance with them; these negotiations involve the player trying to increase the demon's mood, and start with the player picking an attitude – friendly or intimidating – after which they <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> {{how to respond to}} what the demon says or does, and whether to give the demon items or money it asks for. Demons act differently depending on their personality, as well as the in-game phase of the moon; it is impossible to converse with demons during full moon, forcing the player to fight or flee. Depending on choices the player makes throughout the game, their moral alignment changes; the different alignments are [...] "law", [...] "chaos", and [...] "neutrality". These affect how the plot progresses, and how easy or difficult it is to form alliances with certain demon types, depending on how compatible the player's and the demon's alignments are.|$|E

500|$|Sotomayor {{had wanted}} to become a judge since she was in {{elementary}} school, and in 1991 she was recommended for a spot by Democratic New York senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan. Moynihan had an unusual bipartisan arrangement with his fellow New York senator, Republican Al D'Amato, whereby he would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> roughly {{one out of every four}} New York district court seats even though a Republican was in the White House. Moynihan also wanted to fulfill a public promise he had made to get a Hispanic judge appointed for New York. When Moynihan's staff recommended her to him, they said [...] "Have we got a judge for you!" [...] Moynihan identified with her socio-economic and academic background and became convinced she would become the first Hispanic Supreme Court justice. D'Amato became an enthusiastic backer of Sotomayor, who was seen as politically centrist at the time. Of the impending drop in salary from private practice, Sotomayor said: [...] "I've never wanted to get adjusted to my income because I knew I wanted to go back to public service. And in comparison to what my mother earns and how I was raised, it's not modest at all." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{opinions}} of Jasmine have been generally mixed; some critics appreciated the character for continuing to [...] "break the mold" [...] {{that had been}} established by Disney's earliest princesses. Ty Burr of Entertainment Weekly described Jasmine as Disney's [...] "most full-bodied" [...] heroine, while Desson Howe of The Washington Post commended the character for providing the film with [...] "feminist consciousness". The Christian Science Monitors David Sterrit wrote that Jasmine [...] "is less carefully worked out [...] but equally likable as a personality type." [...] Contactmusic.com agreed that the character exhibits [...] "likeably cynical streaks" [...] despite being an [...] "essentially bland" [...] character. Gary Thompson of the Philadelphia Daily News wrote, [...] "Princess Jasmine is also more barbed, yet without the obvious feminist makeover given to Belle". Similarly, James Berardinelli of ReelViews commended Jasmine for [...] "show the same streak of stubborn independence exhibited by Ariel and Belle," [...] but ultimately criticized the fact that [...] "she doesn't fill a more pressing role than that of Aladdin's 'love interest.'" [...] Agreeing that Jasmine appears [...] "bland" [...] in comparison to Aladdins supporting characters, Mari Ness of Tor.com wrote, [...] "Jasmine follows {{in the footsteps of}} Ariel and Belle as someone unhappy with the restrictions of her world and her lack of choices: like both of them, she takes active steps to change this, and it's not entirely her fault that she's a secondary character in a film not all that interested in her... She's perceptive, and fast thinking, but this isn't her movie, and in the end, although she does <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> her own husband, she doesn't really get a chance, like Ariel and Belle, to move out of her world. She can be shown the world, but she stays in her palace." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1981, {{the success}} of her {{performance}} in the Royal Court Theatre's production of Four in a Million led to many offers; one being the chance to move into television comedy. The BBC was quick to cast her in the BBC Scotland sketch comedy programme A Kick Up the Eighties. The network {{was so impressed with}} her that it offered her her own series. She initially turned down the offer. [...] "My first reaction was you must be joking, as women are treated so shoddily in comedy. Big busty barmaids and all those sort of cliches just bore me rigid." [...] She also had reservations {{due to a lack of}} female contemporaries. [...] "At that time English women were't really allowed to be funny on television. I didn't have any examples. I mean, I didn't have a Gilda Radner, Carol Burnett, Lily Tomlin. I mean, my only point of reference, quite honestly, was the Benny Hill girls." [...] Ullman got into her performing arts school by doing an impersonation of Lily Tomlin. Eventually a deal was made with the proviso that she would <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> the show's writers, have script approval, and choose the costumes. Three of a Kind, co-starring comedians Lenny Henry and David Copperfield, debuted in 1981.|$|E
2500|$|Before 2011, the {{condemned}} {{was given an}} opportunity to have a last meal based on what the unit's cafeteria could prepare from its stock. Robert Perkinson, author of Texas Tough: The Rise of America's Prison Empire, said in 2010 that most condemned prisoners ordered [...] "standard American fare in heaping portions, the sorts of meals that recall a childhood Sunday." [...] Many female prisoners under the death sentence did not take a last meal. [...] However, Lawrence Russel Brewer, a white supremacist gang member convicted for the high-profile hate crime dragging death of James Byrd Jr., ordered a large last meal and did not eat it before his execution. In response, John Whitmire, a member of the Texas legislature, asked the TDCJ to stop special meals. Whitmire stated to the press that Brewer's victim, Mr. Byrd, [...] "didn't <b>get</b> <b>to</b> <b>choose</b> his last meal." [...] The TDCJ complied. Brian Price, a former prison chef, offered to personally cook and pay for any subsequent special last meal since the TDCJ is not paying for them anymore. However, Whitmire warned in a letter that he would seek formal state legislation when lawmakers next convened if the [...] "last meal" [...] tradition wasn't stopped immediately. [...] Afterwards, the TDCJ stopped serving special last meals, and will only allow execution chamber prisoners to {{have the same kind of}} meal served to regular prisoners. [...] Many prisoners requested cigarettes (which were denied as TDCJ has banned smoking in its facilities).|$|E
