40|$|AbstractInflammatory bowel {{disease is}} an immune-mediated {{intestinal}} inflammatory condition that {{is associated with}} an increase in autoantibodies that bind to epithelial cells. However, it is unknown whether the epithelial cell-derived products that are recognized by such autoantibodies are involved in the pathogenic process. Through a combined antigen-screening approach utilizing humoral and cellular immune responses, we <b>identify</b> <b>herein</b> an epithelial lectin, galectin- 4, that specifically stimulates IL- 6 production by CD 4 + T cells. Interestingly, the reactivity of CD 4 + T cells to galectin- 4 is precisely elicited under intestinal inflammatory conditions. The galectin- 4 -mediated production of IL- 6 is MHC class II independent and induced by PKCθ-associated pathway through the immunological synapse. The galectin- 4 -mediated stimulation of CD 4 + T cells is shown to exacerbate chronic colitis and delay the recovery from acute intestinal injury. These studies identify the presence of an immunogenic, endogenous lectin in the intestine and dissect the biological role of lectin/CD 4 + T cell interactions under inflammatory conditions...|$|R

40|$|We <b>identify</b> <b>herein</b> a novel {{signaling}} {{function of the}} Toll-like receptor- 4 (TLR 4), the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) receptor mediating the innate immune response, in inducing the expression of CD 11 b/CD 18 integrin in polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNs). Studies were made in PMNs isolated from TLR 4 -deficient (TLR 4 -/-) and C 57 BL/ 6 (WT) mice. We observed increased CD 11 b expression in WT PMNs within 3 hr after LPS challenge, whereas CD 11 b was not expressed in TLR 4 -/- PMNs above basal levels. TLR 4 -activated CD 11 b expression was cycloheximide-sensitive and involved the activation of transcription factors, NF-κB and c-Jun/PU. 1. TLR 4 -/- PMNs challenged with LPS were functionally defective {{as the result of}} the impaired CD 11 b expression in that they failed to adhere and did not migrate across endothelial cells in response to fMLP. TLR 4 also promoted increased binding of LPS to PMNs on the basis expression of CD 11 b. Thus, TLR 4 signaling activates synthesis and upregulation of CD 11 b and is essential for PMN adhesion and transmigration. Our data suggest an important role of TLR 4 activated CD 11 b expression in the mechanism of the PMN host-defense response to LPS. 2 LCMP- 00327 - 2004. R...|$|R
40|$|Distributive, procedural, and {{interactional}} justice are constructs {{that are}} increasingly being recognized as important factors that affect individual perceptions in the workplace environment. This paper presents a theoretical perspective that suggests that justice is perceived through a subjective lens that consists of individualized beliefs and proposes that cultural attributes and demographic characteristics play an integral part in determining the perception of justice. The distinctions between these three constructs are presented in context with the core beliefs of individual employees ? affected by a multitude of perceptual and demographic factors that we briefly <b>identify</b> <b>herein.</b> Based on the theoretical perspective, scales that measure the constructs of justice as perceived by individuals was developed. With a focus on justice within the business setting, hypotheses about attitudes related to justice were tested. Survey results confirm that the three constructs of justice are distinct but correlated. Significant {{differences were found in}} the perceptions of African-American respondents with regard to procedural justice. Although the empirical findings do not support all the hypotheses, this research highlights the need for further development of measures to assess the perception of justice in business settings and at an applied level, underscores the importance of recognizing cultural attributes and demographic characteristics in understanding how justice is perceived.

40|$|One issue {{associated}} with the use of Large-Eddy Simulation (LES) to investigate the dispersion of small inertial particles in turbulent flows is the accuracy with which particle statistics and concentration can be reproduced. The motion of particles in LES fields may differ significantly from that observed in experiments or direct numerical simulation (DNS) because the force acting on the particles is not accurately estimated, due to the availability of the only filtered fluid velocity, and because errors accumulate in time leading to a progressive divergence of the trajectories. This may lead to different degrees of inaccuracy in the prediction of statistics and concentration. We <b>identify</b> <b>herein</b> an ideal subgrid correction of the a-priori LES fluid velocity seen by the particles in turbulent channel flow. This correction is computed by imposing that the trajectories of individual particles moving in filtered DNS fields exactly coincide with the particle trajectories in a DNS. In this way the errors introduced by filtering into the particle motion equations can be singled out and analyzed separately from those due to the progressive divergence of the trajectories. The subgrid correction term, and therefore the filtering error, is characterized in the present paper in terms of statistical moments. The effects of the particle inertia and of the filter type and width on the properties of the correction term are investigated. Comment: 15 pages, 24 figures.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of Neural Stem Cells (NSC) from different niches of embryonic or postnatal forebrain (subventricular zone and hippocampus) {{as well as}} cerebellum is promoted {{by a number of}} stemness genes (e. g. Nanog, Oct 4, Sox 2). Inspite of our good understanding of the mechanisms regulating these stemness drivers, there is a poor knowledge about their target genes, whereby stem cell features are regulated. We <b>identify</b> <b>herein</b> miR- 17 / 92 cluster as a target of Nanog. Nanog controls miR- 17 / 92 cluster by binding to the upstream regulatory region and enhancing its transcription in NSC. Whereas miR- 17 / 92 expression is upregulated in NSC, it decreases alongside differentiation and cell maturation. MiR- 17 family further enhances both clonogenicity and proliferation of NSC. Conversely, antagonizing miR- 17 family yields an opposing effect. MiR- 17 family has a number of potential targets involved in cell cycle and proliferation. We identify here the Transformation related protein 53 -induced nuclear protein 1 (TRP 53 INP 1), a proapoptotic stress-induced p 53 target gene. MiR- 17 family expression paralleled the reduced TRP 53 INP 1 levels. Silencing TRP 53 INP 1 in NSC enhances both self-renewal and proliferation. Infact the increase of Nanog and miR- 17 family expression helps in transition from G 1 to S phase of NSC cycle coinciding with the reduction of TRP 53 INP 1. Collectively, Nanog via miR- 17 / 92 cluster regulates NSC by silencing TRP 53 INP 1. These findings allowed us to expand the regulatory circuitry of p 53 signalling via Nanog in NSC and suggested the role of miRNAs in the {{maintenance of}} NSC.
