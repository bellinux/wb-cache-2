5|$|After Cadwallon ap Cadfan, {{the king}} of Gwynedd, in {{alliance}} with the pagan Penda of Mercia, killed Edwin of Deira in battle at Hatfield Chase in 633 (or 632, depending on when the years used by Bede are considered to have begun), Northumbria was split between its constituent kingdoms of Bernicia and Deira. Oswald's brother Eanfrith became king of Bernicia, but {{he was killed by}} Cadwallon in 634 (or 633) after attempting to negotiate peace. Subsequently, Oswald, {{at the head of a}} small army (possibly with the aid of allies from the north, the Scots and/or the Picts), met Cadwallon in battle at Heavenfield, near Hexham. Before the battle, Oswald had a wooden cross erected; he <b>knelt</b> <b>down,</b> holding the cross in position until enough earth had been thrown in the hole to make it stand firm. He then prayed and asked his army to join in.|$|E
25|$|On 13 December 2014, Lyon {{was named}} {{man of the}} match in the first Test of the Border–Gavaskar Trophy series against India at the Adelaide Oval after taking a {{personal}} best haul for the match of 5 for 134 in the first innings and 7 for 152 in the second. This was the first match the Australian team had played after the passing of Phillip Hughes just two weeks earlier. After taking the final wicket of the match to secure the victory for Australia, Lyon <b>knelt</b> <b>down,</b> patted Hughes's Test number 408 that had been painted on {{the field for the}} match.|$|E
25|$|Wojtyła {{became the}} 264th pope {{according}} to the chronological list of popes, the first non-Italian in 455 years. At only 58 years of age, he was the youngest pope since Pope Pius IX in 1846, who was 54. Like his predecessor, John PaulII dispensed with the traditional Papal coronation and instead received ecclesiastical investiture with a simplified Papal inauguration on 22 October 1978. During his inauguration, when the cardinals were to kneel before him to take their vows and kiss his ring, he stood up as the Polish prelate Stefan Cardinal Wyszyński <b>knelt</b> <b>down,</b> stopped him from kissing the ring, and simply hugged him.|$|E
60|$|Honoria <b>knelt</b> quietly <b>down</b> on the grass, and watched, {{silent and}} motionless, the dead face, with her wide, awestruck eyes.|$|R
60|$|Blondel tuned his harp to his boldest measure, {{to welcome}} the {{introduction}} of the victor into the pavilion of Queen Berengaria. He entered, supported on either side by his sponsors, Richard and Thomas Longsword, and <b>knelt</b> gracefully <b>down</b> before the Queen, though more than half the homage was silently rendered to Edith, who sat on her right hand.|$|R
60|$|When Colonel Everard entered, the clergyman {{raised his}} finger, as cautioning him to forbear {{disturbing}} the divine {{service of the}} evening, {{and pointed to a}} seat; to which, struck deeply with the scene he had witnessed, the intruder stole with as light a step as possible, and <b>knelt</b> devoutly <b>down</b> as one of the little congregation.|$|R
25|$|Cao Cao died {{in early}} 220 and was succeeded {{by his son}} Cao Pi. Later that year, Cao Pi ended the Eastern Han dynasty and {{established}} the state of Cao Wei with him as its first emperor. Sun Quan pledged allegiance to Cao Pi in 221 and sent Yu Jin back to Wei in autumn. By then, Yu Jin was a pallid-looking {{old man with a}} head full of grey hair. He <b>knelt</b> <b>down,</b> kowtowed and cried when he met Cao Pi. Cao Pi comforted him, told him about Xun Linfu and Mengmingshi, and then commissioned him as General Who Pacifies the Borders (安遠將軍).|$|E
25|$|As chancellor, Brandt {{developed}} his Neue Ostpolitik (New Eastern Policy). Brandt {{was active in}} creating a degree of rapprochement with East Germany, and also in improving relations with the Soviet Union, Poland, Czechoslovakia, and other Eastern Bloc (communist) countries. A seminal moment came in December 1970 with the famous Warschauer Kniefall in which Brandt, apparently spontaneously, <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> at the monument to victims of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising. The uprising occurred during the Nazi German military occupation of Poland, and the monument is to those killed by the German troops who suppressed the uprising and deported remaining ghetto residents to the concentration camps for extermination.|$|E
25|$|Winter {{then went}} to see Wurmbrand at Dominee Dana Minnaar's house, hoping to clear up misunderstandings and bring about reconciliation. Winter said that he sympathised with the plight of persecuted Christians in Romania, but that Romania was far away, and Christians in Namibia {{had to face the}} evils of apartheid, which were far more immediate. Wurmbrand said that this was being parochial; South Africa did not aim at world domination, but {{communism}} did, therefore Winter should concentrate his energies on fighting communism. As he was leaving, Winter <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> in front of Wurmbrand and asked for his blessing. Wurmbrand refused at first, but Winter insisted, saying that he wanted the blessing of one who had suffered for his faith.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Downing {{uttered a}} grunt of satisfaction, and bent {{once more to}} his task. Boots flew about the room. Mr. <b>Downing</b> <b>knelt</b> {{on the floor beside}} the basket, and dug like a terrier at a rat-hole.|$|R
60|$|His head fell over, and Harold, laying {{him gently}} <b>down,</b> <b>knelt</b> beside Stephen. He {{put his arm}} round her; and she, turning to him, laid {{her hand on his}} breast and sobbed as though her heart would break.|$|R
6000|$|Loud laughed the graceless Mark, [...] But Vivien, into Camelot stealing, lodged [...] Low in the city, {{and on a}} festal day [...] When Guinevere was {{crossing}} the great hall [...] Cast herself <b>down,</b> <b>knelt</b> to the Queen, and wailed.|$|R
25|$|In chapter 68, {{in another}} battle after Xiaoyao Ford, when Ling Tong was duelling with Yue Jin, Cao Xiu fired an arrow which hit Ling's horse, causing Ling {{to be thrown}} to the ground. Just as Yue Jin was moving in for the kill, he was {{suddenly}} hit by an arrow in the face. Both sides immediately rushed forth to rescue their respective generals and withdrew their forces after that. Later, Ling Tong was surprised to hear from Sun Quan that it was Gan Ning who saved him, and he <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> and thanked the latter. Since then, Ling Tong forgot his past feud with Gan Ning and they became close friends.|$|E
25|$|Inside Fort Caroline, La Vigne {{was keeping}} watch with his company, but taking pity on his sentinels, wet and {{fatigued}} {{with the heavy}} rain, he let them leave their stations with the approach of day, and finally he himself retired to his own quarters. With the break of day on September 20, the feast of St. Matthew, Menéndez was already alert. Before dawn he held a consultation with his captains, after which the entire party <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> and prayed for a victory over their enemies. Then he {{set out for the}} fort over the narrow path which led to it from the woods. A French prisoner, Jean Francois, led the way, his hands bound behind him, {{and the end of the}} rope held by Menéndez himself.|$|E
25|$|In chapter 67, {{during a}} banquet to {{celebrate}} Lü Meng and Gan Ning's victory at Wan County (皖縣), {{just before the}} Battle of Xiaoyao Ford, Ling Tong was angry when he saw Lü Meng praising Gan Ning, so he offered to perform a sword dance and use the opportunity to avenge his father. Gan Ning sensed Ling Tong's intention so he also offered to perform with his pair of jis. Lü Meng realised that {{they were about to}} fight, so he drew his sword, carried a shield, and stood between the two men to separate them. When Sun Quan heard about the incident, he came to the banquet hall and everyone put down their weapons. When Sun Quan chided them for fighting, Ling Tong cried and <b>knelt</b> <b>down.</b> Sun Quan had to repeatedly urge him to stop provoking Gan Ning.|$|E
60|$|Among {{those who}} were calm and collected, though heart-stricken and deadly pale, was Loo Marrot. She {{had been sent to}} the station by her father to await the arrival of the train, with orders to bring Will Garvie home. When Will was carried out and laid on the {{platform}} alive, an irresistible gush of feeling overpowered her. She did not give way to noisy demonstration, as too many did, but <b>knelt</b> hastily <b>down,</b> raised his head on her knee, and kissed his face passionately.|$|R
5000|$|The {{car that}} had stopped - men {{got out of}} it very quickly who were {{carrying}} guns in their hands. Then I heard the sound of my rear door opening. I saw that Mark Duggan got out and ran. At the same time, I heard firing from the front. I saw shots strike Mark Duggan. He fell to the ground. 'Mark Duggan only got 2ft-3ft from my car when he was shot'. At the same time a man came and he opened my door. Very angrily he pulled me out by my arm and then he dropped me or <b>knelt</b> me <b>down</b> on the ground by the rear tyres of the car.|$|R
50|$|When {{your last}} {{involvement}} in witchcraft happened, I hoped {{that you would}} carefully reexamine your fault, but I did not expect you to hide Yan Daoyu in your household. Your father was angry beyond reason, and even though I <b>knelt</b> and bowed <b>down</b> to ask for his forgiveness, his anger would not go away. Why should I continue to live? Send me poison. I would rather commit suicide first myself than to see you suffer great disaster.|$|R
25|$|Still {{wearing her}} {{fluorescent}} jacket, she <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> at least 15 meters {{in front of}} the bulldozer, and began waving her arms and shouting, just as activists had successfully done dozens of times that day.... When it got so close that it was moving the earth beneath her, she climbed onto the pile of rubble being pushed by the bulldozer.... Her head and upper torso were above the bulldozer's blade, and the bulldozer operator and co-operator could clearly see her. Despite this, the operator continued forward, which caused her to fall back, out of view of the driver. He continued forward, and she tried to scoot back, but was quickly pulled underneath the bulldozer. We ran towards him, and waved our arms and shouted; one activist with the megaphone. But the bulldozer operator continued forward, until Corrie was all the way underneath the central section of the bulldozer.|$|E
25|$|Pang De's {{role in the}} Battle of Fancheng (mentioned {{in chapter}} 70) was largely exaggerated for {{dramatic}} effect. Prior to the battle, Pang De volunteered to lead the vanguard of a reinforcement army to relief Cao Ren's forces, who were besieged in Fan by Guan Yu's army. Cao Cao was delighted and he granted Pang De the post. However, when others advised Cao Cao against granting Pang De command of the vanguard due to Pang's past associations with Ma Chao (who {{had become one of}} the Five Tiger Generals under Liu Bei), Pang <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> in front of Cao and kowtowed until his face was covered in blood. Cao Cao was moved by Pang De's sincerity and he no longer doubted Pang's allegiance towards him, so he appointed Pang as the vanguard. Pang De later ordered a wooden coffin to be built and he told his men to place Guan Yu's body inside if he succeeded in killing Guan, or place his body inside if he died in battle.|$|E
25|$|Countess Sztáray {{noticed a}} small brown stain above the empress's left breast. Alarmed that Elisabeth had not {{recovered}} consciousness, she informed {{the captain of}} her identity, and the boat turned back to Geneva. Elisabeth was carried back to the Hotel Beau-Rivage by six sailors on a stretcher improvised from a sail, cushions and two oars. Fanny Mayer, {{the wife of the}} hotel director, a visiting nurse, and the countess undressed Elisabeth and removed her shoes, when Sztáray noticed a few small drops of blood and a small wound. When they then removed her from the stretcher to the bed she was clearly dead; Frau Mayer believed the two audible breaths she heard the Empress take as she was brought into the room were her last. Two doctors, Dr. Golay and Dr. Mayer arrived, along with a priest, who was too late to grant her absolution. Mayer incised the artery of her left arm to ascertain death, and found no blood. She was pronounced dead at 2:10p.m. Everyone <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> and prayed for the repose of her soul, and Countess Sztáray closed Elisabeth's eyes and joined her hands. No matter how reluctant or resentful she was of the title, Elisabeth had been the Empress of Austria for 44 years.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{hope the}} roof will hold," [...] shouted George, but Harold took no heed. He was {{thinking}} of other things. They lit the lanterns, of which they now had three, and the Colonel slid down into the great grave he had so industriously dug, motioning to George to follow. This that worthy did, not without trepidation. Then they both <b>knelt</b> and stared <b>down</b> {{through the hole in}} the masonry, but the light of the lanterns was not strong enough to enable them to make out anything with clearness.|$|R
60|$|On {{reaching}} the ground he <b>knelt,</b> set <b>down</b> the lamp, and attached his guide-line to the stone. While thus engaged he looked with much interest at his little lamp, which burned as brightly and steadily {{down in the}} depths of ocean as if on land, while, from its chimney the air which gave it life rose upwards in a constant stream of bubbles. The water being dense and very dark its light did not penetrate far, but close to the bull's-eye it was sufficiently strong to enable our hero to see what he was about. Having fixed the line, he was about to move {{in the direction of the}} wreck when he received one pull on his life-line. Replying to it with one pull--"all right"--he was again about to move, when a strange unearthly sound filled his ears, and he smiled to think that in his interest about the lamp and fastening his guide-line he had totally forgotten the speaking apparatus connected with his helmet.|$|R
5|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage. Pořádek testified that Blythe knocked him <b>down,</b> <b>knelt</b> on him and held him down for a moment, but Blythe definitely did not choke him. He also admitted that taking into account the fact that he (Pořádek) was drunk and the way he acted, Blythe's reaction was adequate. He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.|$|R
25|$|The second PPV {{match of}} the night carried the {{stipulation}} that {{the captain of the}} losing team (El Zorro or Charly Manson) would receive 10 lashes with a Singapore cane. The real development came after the match as the storyline of the 10 lashes received more attention than the preceding match. After nearly 20 minutes of wrestling X-Pac executed his X-Factor finishing move on El Zorro twice and then pinned him. Following the loss Zorro calmly removed his shirt and then <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> to take his punishment. X-Pac and Rocky Romero delivered the first three strikes to the back of El Zorro who took the punishment without complaining. When Charly Manson returned to the ring wearing a Zorro style mask and mockingly offering El Zorro a paper rose El Zorro became enraged and started to fight back. He took the Singapore cane from Romero and began hitting his opponents, moments later Dark Ozz and Dark Escoria's team mates Dark Espiritu and Dark Cuervo ran to the ring, giving the rudo side a five on three advantage. El Zorro and the Black Family beat up all three members and successfully fought off Real Fuerza Aérea who came to the ring to make the save. In the closing minutes of the segment El Zorro confronted Marisel Peña who sat at ringside, Peña slapped El Zorro, a move that seemingly shocked El Zorro.|$|E
25|$|Rey Cometa was {{accompanied}} by Stuka, Jr. for his one-on-one match with Namajague, while his opponent had Okumura at ringside, bringing all four participants in the Homenaje a Dos Leyendas main event back together again. Okumura helped his partner by attacking Rey Cometa before the bell could even ring, giving Namajague the advantage for the first fall, allowing him to pin Cometa after a power bomb. Stuka, Jr. helped Cometa by keeping Okumura at bay during the second fall, even when the two wrestlers fought outside the ring. At one point Rey Cometa was able to leap off the elevated stage, landing a Moonsault assault on Namajague. Once back inside the ring Rey Cometa forced Namajague to submit to an Armbar submission hold. The third fall was the longest of the match as saw both men hold the advantage in the match at different times. After looking like he would lose Rey Cometa was able to outsmart Namajague, allowing him to land a 450° splash so he could pin him to win the match. Following the match Namajague, who had resisted removing his mask during the Dos Leyendas show, accepted the loss and <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> as Rey Cometa began to cut his hair. After getting a few handfuls of Namajague's black and bleached hair he left the official CMLL barber finish up, shaving all of Namajague's hair off while still sitting {{in the center of}} the ring.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} home {{belonged to}} a mother of seven. There were no tables or cutlery in the house, and the toilet operated without plumbing. Roaches and rats ran across the floor. Kennedy's attention was drawn to a 20 month-old boy who was playing with rice grains on the floor. The child was covered in sores and bloated from hunger. Kennedy <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> and stroked his cheek. He said, [...] "My God, I didn't know {{this kind of thing}} existed. How can a country like this allow it? Maybe they just don't know." [...] Clark labeled what lay before them a [...] "national disgrace." [...] Kennedy caressed the child and talked to him, but elicited no response. The senator began to cry.|$|E
60|$|He was, however, {{a humane}} man, and {{considerate}} of the beasts {{that worked for}} him, and accordingly thrust his hand inside the old fur coat when he had loosed the uninjured horse, and drew out a long-bladed knife. Then he <b>knelt,</b> and setting <b>down</b> the lantern, felt for the place to strike. When he found it his courage almost deserted him, and meeting the eyes that seemed {{to look up at}} him with dumb appeal, turned his head away. Still, {{he was a man who}} would not shirk a painful duty, and shaking off the sense of revulsion turned again and stroked the beast's head.|$|R
60|$|And {{how should}} Dorothea not marry?--a girl so {{handsome}} {{and with such}} prospects? Nothing could hinder it but her love of extremes, and her insistence on regulating life according to notions which might cause a wary man to hesitate before he made her an offer, or even might lead her at last to refuse all offers. A young lady of some birth and fortune, who <b>knelt</b> suddenly <b>down</b> on a brick floor {{by the side of}} a sick laborer and prayed fervidly as if she thought herself living in the time of the Apostles--who had strange whims of fasting like a Papist, and of sitting up at night to read old theological books! Such a wife might awaken you some fine morning with a new scheme for the application of her income which would interfere with political economy and the keeping of saddle-horses: a man would naturally think twice before he risked himself in such fellowship. Women were expected to have weak opinions; but the great safeguard of society and of domestic life was, that opinions were not acted on. Sane people did what their neighbors did, so that if any lunatics were at large, one might know and avoid them.|$|R
50|$|Milan Pořádek, the fan whom Blythe {{admitted}} to shoving off the stage, testified {{on the third}} day of the trial. Pořádek said he climbed the stage twice in order to stage dive; he changed his mind during the third attempt to get on stage.

He commented that he grasped {{the fact that he was}} not wanted on stage.Another witness who had attended the concert at the rear of the crowd testified that Blythe's behavior was standard to metal concerts, saying that metal bands always put on angry and tough acts and the concert at issue was no exception. She said that it was evident that Blythe did not want any fans on the stage. Neither the two nor any other witness who took the stand that day gave a testimony as to the moment of Nosek's fall at the end of the concert.|$|R
500|$|Nelson {{returned}} {{briefly to}} Merton to set his affairs {{in order and}} bid farewell to Emma, before travelling back to London {{and then on to}} Portsmouth, arriving there early in the morning of 14 September. He breakfasted at the George Inn with his friends George Rose, the Vice-President of the Board of Trade, and George Canning, the Treasurer of the Navy. During the breakfast word spread of Nelson's presence at the inn and a large crowd of well wishers gathered. They accompanied Nelson to his barge and cheered him off, which Nelson acknowledged by raising his hat. Nelson was recorded as having turned to his colleague and stated, [...] "I had their huzzas before: I have their hearts now". Robert Southey reported that of the onlookers for Nelson's walk to the dock, [...] "Many were in tears and many <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> before him and blessed him as he passed".|$|E
500|$|The first live {{performance}} of [...] "Like a Prayer" [...] {{was on the}} 1990 Blond Ambition World Tour. She sang it wearing a dress {{that looked like a}} cross between a Mediterranean widow's attire and a clergy's robe. Hundreds of burning candles surrounded her as she <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> in front of the stage, the backup singers crying the words [...] "Oh my God" [...] several times. Madonna eventually removed a scarf from her head to display a huge crucifix hanging from her neck, and then rose and sang the full song, while her dancers gyrated around her. Two different performances were taped and released on video: the Blond Ambition: Japan Tour 90, taped in Yokohama, Japan, on April 27, 1990, and Blond Ambition World Tour Live, taped in Nice, France, on August 5, 1990. On his review of the latter release, Entertainment Weeklys Ty Burr praised the [...] "gymnastic dance productions in songs such as 'Where's the Party' and 'Like a Prayer'", calling them [...] "astonishing".|$|E
500|$|A day later, Madonna {{appeared}} on France's Le Grand Journal show. She performed an edited version of [...] "Living for Love" [...] and [...] "Ghosttown". Nicaise described the performance as [...] "an intimate {{interpretation of the}} already known ballad". Writing for Idolator, Bradley Stern {{described it as a}} [...] "deeply emotional performance", where Madonna stood against a piano and sang the song. In the giant screens located {{on either side of the}} platform, burning cities of images were broadcast, as well as those of the World Trade Center collapses during the attack of September 11, 2001. The next performance happened at The Ellen DeGeneres Show in the United States, where Madonna sang [...] "Ghosttown" [...] wearing a black leather dress. She <b>knelt</b> <b>down</b> at one point during the song, and arose to sing the final chorus. Stern gave a positive feedback in MuuMuse, saying that [...] "Madonna delivered yet another stirring performance of the post-apocalyptic tune. In fact, it was likely her best to date, from the outfit choice to the raw, emotional vocal delivery." ...|$|E
60|$|Black {{drops of}} blood on the stones and an {{irregular}} trail of footprints proved to Jean that the gunman was hard hit. Here he had fallen, or <b>knelt,</b> or sat <b>down,</b> evidently to bind his wounds. Jean found strips of scarf, red and discarded. And the blood drops failed to show on more rocks. In a deep forest of spruce, under silver-tipped spreading branches, Queen had rested, perhaps slept. Then laboring with dragging steps, not improbably with a lame leg, he had gone on, up out of the dark-green ravine to the open, dry, pine-tipped ridge. Here he had rested, perhaps waited to see if he were pursued. From that point his trail spoke an easy language for Jean's keen eye. The gunman knew he was pursued. He had seen his enemy. Therefore Jean proceeded with a slow caution, never getting within revolver range of ambush, using all his woodcraft to trail this man and yet save himself. Queen traveled slowly, either because he was wounded or else because he tried to ambush his pursuer, and Jean accommodated his pace to that of Queen. From noon of that day they were never far apart, never out of hearing of a rifle shot.|$|R
60|$|On {{the morning}} of the seventh day we came to Memphis, the city of the White Hall. Here, for three days I rested from my journey and was entertained of the priests of the {{wonderful}} Temple of Ptah the Creator, and shown the beauties of the great and marvellous city. Also I was led in secret by the High Priest and two others into the holy presence of the God Apis, the Ptah who deigns to dwell among men {{in the form of a}} bull. The God was black, and on his forehead there was a white square, on his back was a white mark shaped like an eagle, beneath his tongue was the likeness of a scarabæus, in his tail were double hairs, and a plate of pure gold hung between his horns. I entered the place of the God and worshipped, while the High Priest and those with him stood aside, watching earnestly. And when I had worshipped, saying the words which had been told me, the God <b>knelt,</b> and lay <b>down</b> before me. Then the High Priest and those with him, who, as I heard in after time, were great men of Upper Egypt, approached wondering, and, saying no word, made obeisance to me because of the omen. And many other things I saw in Memphis that are too long to write of here.|$|R
6000|$|Sept. 3.--This day I went to Claremont {{to be sworn}} in. When the [...] {{council was}} constructed, the Duke of Buckingham and Lord Liverpool [...] were first called in to take their oaths and seats; then the [...] {{remaining}} four followed, Lincoln, Eliot, Ernest Bruce, and I. The [...] Queen sat {{at the head of}} the table, composed but dejected--one [...] could not but feel for her, all through the ceremonial. We <b>knelt</b> [...] <b>down</b> to take the oaths of allegiance and supremacy and stood up to [...] take (I think) the councillor's oath, then kissed the Queen's hand, [...] then went round the table shaking hands with each member, beginning [...] from Prince Albert who sat on the Queen's right, and ending with [...] Lord Wharncliffe on her left. We then sat at the lower end of the [...] table, excepting Lord E. Bruce, who went to his place behind the [...] Queen as vice-chamberlain. Then the chancellor first and next the [...] Duke of Buckingham were sworn to their respective offices. C. [...] Greville forgot the duke's privy seal and sent him off without it; [...] the Queen corrected him and gave it.... Then were read and approved [...] several orders in council; among which was one assigning a district [...] to a church and another appointing Lord Ripon and me to act in [...] matters of trade. These were read aloud by the Queen in a very [...] clear though subdued voice; and she repeated 'Approved' after each. [...] Upon that relating to Lord R. and myself we were called up and [...] kissed hands again. Then the Queen rose, as did all the members of [...] the council, and retired bowing. We had luncheon in the same room [...] half an hour later and went off. The Duke of Wellington went in an [...] open carriage with a pair; all our other grand people with four. [...] Peel looked shy all through. I visited Claremont once before, 27 [...] years ago I think, as a child, to see the place, soon after the [...] Princess Charlotte's death. It corresponded pretty much with my [...] impressions.|$|R
