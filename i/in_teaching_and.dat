5|$|Harper was an {{accomplished}} scholar (Semiticist) {{and a member}} of the Baptist clergy who believed that a great university should maintain the study of faith as a central focus, to prepare students for careers <b>in</b> <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> research and ministers for service to the church and community. As per this commitment, he brought the University of Chicago's Seminary to Hyde Park which had remained continually in operation after the loss of the Bronzeville campus through the Baptist Theological Union in Morgan Park. This became the Divinity School in 1891, the first professional school at the University of Chicago.|$|E

After a brief career <b>in</b> <b>teaching,</b> <b>and</b> having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} effective leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning involving capacity building, so {{that leadership}} occurs at multiple levels {{in order to}} sustain and transform learning. Literature conceptualising leadership as capacity building is examined. The paper considers practical examples of leadership as capacity building <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning, and poses questions for further investigation. Effective leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning must involve a significant element of capacity building, so that leadership occurs at multiple levels in an organization in order to sustain, renew <b>and</b> transform <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning for the future. As Lambert (1998, p. 75) points out, “increasing leadership capacity over time is the most productive way to bring about improvements that can be sustained”. Building leadership capacity <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning is an issue {{because it does not}} always happen. Individuals who have taught online may leave the organization and capacity is thereby lost. Online learning <b>and</b> <b>teaching</b> is affected, as finding staff to <b>teach</b> <b>in</b> online papers can be a challenge. Paradoxically, online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning may hold the solution to its own dilemma, as the key to learning to learn <b>and</b> lead <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning lies within the online settings: one builds capacity for leadership <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning by engaging in learning and leading with a mentor or team within these settings. Leadership obligations <b>in</b> online <b>teaching</b> <b>and</b> learning therefore include the need for those who <b>teach</b> <b>and</b> learn online to work together, ensuring benefits to students, reciprocal learning for teachers involved, as well as a measure of accountability, and ultimately building of leadership capacity...|$|R
