2500|$|In 2008, {{shortly after}} the road {{received}} the I-795 designation, major flaws developed in the route's paving surface. [...] Though rated for a 15-year life span, the pavement began to deteriorate after only 16months of use. [...] During the planning of the road, as early as 2003, some engineers had warned that the thin pavement would be inadequate for heavy truck traffic. [...] However, most NCDOT officials deemed a thicker road surface too expensive, {{as it would have}} added approximately $2.8 million to the cost of the road. At first, replacing sections that were damaged was expected to cost $1.6 million, with estimates for resurfacing the entire road running as high as $10 million. FHWA sent an engineering team to examine the road in its entirety in the middle of 2008. They found flaws in the pavement in the entire highway, not just those already damaged between US117 mile markers85 and 92. They recommended the entire asphalt surface be replaced with an additional [...] added to the width, at a cost between $15 and $22 million. Meanwhile, NCDOT started repairing the damaged portion of the road surface in October 2008, a process that was completed in about a month and cost around $600,000. The new state secretary of transportation, Gene Conti, said he would make a decision, taking the FHWA report into consideration, once he took office in early 2009. He decided to abide by most recommendations of the report and announced in the summer of 2009 that a contract would be let that October with the project starting as early as November 2009. The work, to fix the right lanes first, then put a <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> on all lanes, was completed in November 2010. In 2012, the National Asphalt Pavement Association awarded the repaired 8-mile segment the Sheldon G. Hayes Award, recognizing it as the best highway construction project and the smoothest road of 2011.|$|E
50|$|In Europe and Australia, {{ductile iron}} pipe is {{typically}} manufactured with a zinc coating overlaid by either a bituminous, polymeric, or epoxy <b>finishing</b> <b>layer.</b> EN 545/598 mandates a minimum zinc content of 200 g/m2 (at 99.99% purity) and a minimum average <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> thickness of 70 µm (with local minimum of 50 µm). AS/NZS 2280 mandates a minimum zinc content of 200 g/m2 (with a local minimum of 180 g/m2 at 99.99% purity) and a minimum average <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> thickness of 80 µm.|$|E
5000|$|The {{state of}} {{preservation}} and condition greatly affect how we interpret and evaluate the work at hand. This because [...] "limestone sculptures were occasionally covered with a thin plaster coat, which received additional modeling.

Most of the naturalistic statues are found with their plaster coat, while the less preserved the coat is, the more idealized the work appears.|$|E
30|$|The {{standards}} {{stated in}} ASTM-D 3023 {{were used in}} the varnishing of experimental samples [23]. Varnishing applications were carried out using a spray gun with a 0.8  mm spray opening with an air pressure of 1 – 1.5  bar approximately 20  cm from the sample surfaces. Water-based filling varnish (WF) application onto the surfaces of experimental samples was performed three times at 1  h time intervals between each application according to the advice of producing company. After waiting 24  h, sample surfaces were ground with 280 sandpaper to eliminate fiber swells and to provide surface smoothness. Dust was removed with a soft haired brush. Afterwards, one-component water-based (OCW) <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> varnish was applied to half of the samples to which WF had been applied and two-component water-based (TCW) <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> varnish was applied to {{the other half of the}} samples. Considering the solid content rates to obtain the uniform thickness of the varnish layer (film) in the wood material surfaces, OCW <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> varnish application was performed three times at 1  h time intervals between each application and TCW <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> varnish application was performed twice at 1  h time intervals. To allow complete drying of the varnishes, experimental samples were stored parallel to the ground surface at room temperature for a period of 3  weeks.|$|R
30|$|Due to the {{complexity}} of the sampling and despite the many samples that were taken/studied, only three samples will be discussed here. They are representative of the arsenic sulfide found and the different techniques in which it was used: samples C 90.058 and P 210.011 (loose material) are representative for arsenic sulfide mixed with ultramarine blue, bound with protein-based medium and used as underlayer; sample C 90.094 (P 209.066) corresponds to arsenic sulfide mixed with Prussian blue, used in <b>finishing</b> <b>layers</b> in an urushi-containing oil mediumb; finally, sample C 90.101 (P 209.074) features unmixed arsenic sulfide used in urushi-containing <b>finishing</b> <b>layers.</b>|$|R

50|$|Unprotected ductile iron, {{similarly}} to cast iron, is intrinsically resistant to corrosion in most, although not all, soils. Nonetheless, because of frequent {{lack of information}} on soil aggressiveness and to extend the installed life of buried pipe, ductile iron pipe is commonly protected {{by one or more}} external coatings. In the U.S. and Australia, loose polyethylene sleeving is preferred. In Europe, standards recommend a more sophisticated system of directly bonded zinc coatings overlaid by a <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> be used in conjunction with polyethylene sleeving.|$|E
50|$|Beijing's Inner city is {{also called}} Jingcheng ("capital city") or Dacheng ("big city"). The {{eastern and western}} {{sections}} were originally part of the Yuan city of Dadu, while {{the northern and southern}} sections were built during the early Ming dynasty in the Hongwu (1368-1398) and Yongle (1402-1424) eras. The walls were formed from rammed earth covered with rocks and a <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> of bricks on both the interior and exterior. The average height was 12 to 15 metres. The northern and southern sections, built in the early Ming dynasty, were thicker than the eastern and western sections, built during the Yuan dynasty (1271-1368). The thicker sections averaged 19 to 20 metres at the base and 16 metres at the top, with parapets at the top. The Inner city wall had nine gates and a tower at each corner. There were three sluice gates, 172 enemy sighting towers, and 11,038 battlements. Immediately outside the city walls were deep moats 30 to 60 metres in width.|$|E

40|$|Direct {{analysis}} of synthetic fibers under ambient conditions is highly desired {{to identify the}} polymer, the finishes applied and irregularities that may compromise its performance and value. In this paper, laser ablation electrospray ionization ion mobility time-of-flight mass spectrometry (LAESI-IMSTOF- MS) {{was used for the}} {{analysis of}} synthetic polymers and fibers. The key to this analysis was the absorption of laser light by aliphatic and aromatic nitrogen functionalities in the polymers. Analysis of polyamide (PA) 6, 46, 66, and 12 pellets and PA 6, 66, polyaramid and M 5 fibers yielded characteristic fragment ions without any sample pretreatment, enabling their unambiguous identification. Synthetic fibers are, in addition, commonly covered with a surface layer for improved adhesion and processing. The same setup, but operated in a transient infrared matrix-assisted laser desorption electrospray ionization (IRMALDESI) mode, allowed the detailed characterization of the fiber <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> and the underlying polymer. Differences in <b>finish</b> <b>layer</b> distribution may cause variations in local properties of synthetic fibers.

The influence on the evaluation of defects of the heating, the kind of FRP and the <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> of the reinforcement are analysed.

40|$|The {{investigation}} of the <b>finishing</b> <b>layers</b> in artworks is of main concern, as important information on the artistic technique can be suggested.

Laser Ablation-Mass Spectrometry equipped with Plasma source (LA-ICP-MS) allows a very sensitive element analysis of solid surfaces sampled {{by means of a}} laser. It is an emerging methodology, only in a few cases applied in the field of Cultural Heritage.

40|$|The {{maintenance}} of finishing coats is usually {{thought of as}} an activity relating to how the outermost surfaces of buildings affects {{the quality of the}} environment, today considered a matter of strategic importance. Appearance has gained in importance in its relation to substance, and this new way of reading the streetscape has meant that colour planning is an increasingly important activity. In many new constructions, particularly in non-residential buildings once banished to chromatic empiricism, more and more attention is being paid to choosing the colour of the external surfaces. However, if we are witnessing a new renaissance in the colour of buildings, the same cannot be said about the {{maintenance of}} these colours. The finishing coat is considered to be either strictly dependent on the behaviour of the underlying layers or completely independent of them. In the first case the skin is considered independently of the colour, in the second the inverse: the hue of the <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> is the most important aspect, independent of the behaviour of the support. It should be remembered that there is a long-standing tradition in which the <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> is considered a ‘sacrifice layer’ that does not require maintenance. The common idea of maintaining coloured layers involves the removal of the old layer and/or the application of a new one. If this method of maintaining the skins of buildings was acceptable in the past, the introduction of new products for the creation of thicker outer layers or products made from particular materials means that a new approach must be developed for the maintenance of entire blocks of layers. It would seem that durability, or persistency, is no longer considered to be an essential factor. Hue, lightness and saturation are no longer aspects that need to be conserved. The maintenance of colour finishing coats is considered of fundamental importance only in the restoration of historical buildings. On a hypothetical scale of priorities, where should colour maintenance lie today...|$|E
40|$|Mastic, one of {{the best}} natural varnishes, is {{frequently}} used as protective and <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> or as component of oleo-resinous media in paintings, both in the past and currently. However, this resin is affected by complex deterioration processes which can change its characteristics and thus the visual aspect of works of art. The alteration processes caused by radiation have been widely studied, but {{there is a lack of}} information on the biodeterioration of this natural product. In this paper, fungi from collections as well as from oil paintings of the Fine Arts Museum of Granada (Spain) were inoculated onto slides covered with mastic. The samples, after an incubation period of 15 days, were analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) to identify the chemical changes undergone, and a visual monitoring of the samples was performed to determine the formation of mycelia onto solidified resins. Major changes were detected in Chrysonilia sitophila, Phoma herbarum, and P. chrysogenum, showing evidence of alteration processes caused or favoured by these microorgamisms...|$|E

30|$|Different <b>finishing</b> <b>layers</b> were {{observed}} in the top-coat. The plaster base is directly covered by a thin white limewash, which is overlain by two paint layers, the innermost one, pink in colour, with pigment particles (ochre and iron oxides/hydroxides) mixed with carbonate binder, and the outermost showing a lighter yellowish coloration probably due to a lower concentration of pigment particles.|$|R

30|$|The paint {{sample from}} the pulpit (B 53) shows instead several peaks {{corresponding}} to pimarane and abietane compounds, among which the most abundant are pimaric and dehydroabietic acid (DHA). The relative amount of DHA with respect to its oxidation products, {{as well as the}} presence of pimaradiene compounds such as pimaric and isopimaric acids, point to a well-preserved Pinaceae resin, which had undergone to relatively little oxidation. This suggests the use of the resin in a non-superficial <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> of the complex sample stratigraphy: e.g. the foundation layer directly applied onto the wood support below the pigmented paint layers, or the thick brownish layer among paint layers. The presence of a consistent amount of resinates in the sample {{from the pulpit}} (B 53) points to the formation of carboxylates due to the reaction of the abietane and pimarane acids from the resin from one or more unpigmented layer with the metal ions present in the adjacent pigmented paint layers, indicating the ability of the paint constituents to migrate through the different strata.|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{non-destructive}} testing {{is more and}} more applied even in the field of cultural heritage conservation. The main reason is the capability of inspecting large surfaces without any contact or damage. A large number of testing procedures and processing algorithms allows reaching reliable results both in laboratory or in situ. Well established or innovative techniques are based on the analysis of the thermal process during the quasi-steady or the transient regime. IR thermography may be applied qualitatively or under advanced processing, accordingly to particular demands. The quantitative use of thermography allows an effective investigation of the decay and identification of the causes of the material weakness. Furthermore, the knowledge of the hidden history of the monument is enhanced by a view in the IR. Thermal Non Destructive Testing could analyse different works of art and decay forms. Results given for the following case study are illustrated: fresco detachment sizing, classification and visualization of the building materials below the <b>finishing</b> <b>layer,</b> structural cracks identification for the seismic risk evaluation, monitor of the moisture of structures...|$|E

40|$|Building roofs {{play a very}} {{important}} role in the energy balance of buildings, especially in summer, when they are hit by a rather high solar irradiance. Depending on the type of <b>finishing</b> <b>layer,</b> roofs can absorb a great amount of heat and reach quite high temperatures on their outermost surface, which determines significant room overheating. However, the use of highly reflective cool materials can help to maintain low outer surface temperatures; this practice may improve indoor thermal comfort and reduce the cooling energy need during the hot season. This technology is currently well known and widely used in the USA, while receiving increasing attention in Europe. In order to investigate the effectiveness of cool roofs as a passive strategy for passive cooling in moderately hot climates, this paper presents the numerical results of a case study based on the dynamic thermal analysis of an existing office building in Catania (southern Italy, Mediterranean area). The results show how the application of a cool paint on the roof can enhance the thermal comfort of the occupants by reducing the operative temperatures of the rooms and to reduce the overall energy needs of the building for space heating and cooling...|$|E
40|$|Roofs are {{severely}} hit by solar radiation in summer; hence {{the use of}} cool materials on the <b>finishing</b> <b>layer</b> provides {{a significant reduction in}} the heat flow entering the building, with sensible attenuation in the building cooling load. In this paper, a case study is presented, based on the dynamic simulation of an existing office building in Catania (southern Italy). Here, a part of the roof has been recently treated with a commercial cool paint, with the aim of improving thermal comfort in summer. Hence, the simulations represent a preliminary study that will allow assessing the expected effectiveness of the intervention. More in detail, the results of the simulations will be discussed in terms of both thermal comfort and energy savings, through the evaluation of parameters such as the roof surface temperature, the operative temperature and the cooling load for both conditions, i. e. with and without the cool paint. The paper also discusses the potential increase in the energy needs for winter heating, and looks at the overall annual balance in terms of primary energy; this is made by considering different climatic conditions and envelope characteristics. These aspects are usually not well highlighted in the current scientific literature...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAlthough the {{application}} of internal insulation to existing perimeter walls poses significant challenges in terms of building physics and loss of habitable space, it is sometimes an inevitable choice because of practical or legislative constraints. Innovative solutions are then required to deliver satisfying performances and reduce nuisance to inhabitants of residential buildings in case {{they are going to}} remain in their flats during the retrofit works. Three systems for inner thermal retrofitting purposes have been designed and produced as prototypes. Two of them are composed by silica aerogel containing fibrous material: the first one is a rigid flat laminated panel, the second one is a rollable solution with a fabric <b>finishing</b> <b>layer.</b> The third insulating system is a perlite based board with a hydrophobic layer. All the materials composing the retrofit solutions have been characterized by means of laboratory tests in order to measure their main hygrothermal properties. In fact, some parameters are fundamental for determining the hygrothermal performance of the composite systems: thermal conductivity, at dry and wet state (moisture dependant), water vapour diffusion resistance factor, hygroscopic sorption at isotherm condition and water absorption coefficient. All those measured data were necessary for optimizing the solutions, guaranteeing energy efficiency and vapour open layers to systems that are intended for installation on existing walls...|$|E
