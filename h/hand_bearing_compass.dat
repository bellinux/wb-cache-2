In 2009, Suunto discontinued the Swiss-made Recta DO series, moving all remaining production of Recta compasses from Biel, Switzerland to its production facility in Vantaa, Finland.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>bearing</b> <b>compass</b> is a {{magnetic}} compass mounted {{in such a way}} that it allows the taking of bearings of objects by aligning them with the lubber line of the <b>bearing</b> <b>compass.</b> A surveyor's compass is a specialized compass made to accurately measure heading of landmarks and measure horizontal angles to help with map making. These were already in common use by the early 18th century and are described in the 1728 Cyclopaedia. The <b>bearing</b> <b>compass</b> was steadily reduced in size and weight to increase portability, resulting in a model that could be carried and operated in one hand. In 1885, a patent was granted for a hand compass fitted with a viewing prism and lens that enabled the user to accurately sight the heading of geographical landmarks, thus creating the prismatic compass. [...] Another sighting method was by means of a reflective mirror. First patented in 1902, the Bézard compass consisted of a field compass with a mirror mounted above it. [...] This arrangement enabled the user to align the compass with an objective while simultaneously viewing its bearing in the mirror.|$|R
5000|$|A {{hand compass}} (also <b>hand</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>compass</b> or {{sighting}} compass) is a compact magnetic compass capable of one-hand use and {{fitted with a}} sighting device to record a precise bearing or azimuth to a given target or to determine a location. [...] Hand or sighting compasses include instruments with simple notch-and-post alignment ("gunsights"), prismatic sights, direct or lensatic sights, and mirror/vee (reflected-image) sights. With the additional precision offered by the sighting arrangement, and depending upon construction, sighting compasses provide increased accuracy when measuring precise bearings to an objective.|$|E
5000|$|The marine hand compass, or hand-bearing compass {{as it is}} termed in {{nautical}} use, {{has been}} used by small-boat or inshore sailors since at least the 1920s to keep a running course or to record precise bearings to landmarks on shore in order to determine position via the resection technique. [...] Instead of a magnetized needle or disc, most hand bearing compasses feature liquid damping with a floating card design (a magnetized, degreed float or dial atop a jeweled pivot bearing). [...] Equipped with a viewing prism, the <b>hand</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>compass</b> allows instant reading of forward bearings from the user to an object or vessel, and some provide the reciprocal bearing as well. [...] Modern examples of marine hand bearing compasses include the Suunto KB-14 and KB-77, and the Plastimo Iris 50. [...] These compasses frequently have battery-illuminated or photoluminescent degree dials for use in low light or darkness.|$|E
5000|$|A {{practical}} example of obtaining a position fix {{would be for}} a ship to take bearing measurements on three lighthouses positioned along the coast. These measurements could be made visually using a <b>hand</b> <b>bearing</b> <b>compass,</b> or in poor visibility electronically using radar or radio direction finding. Since all physical observations are subject to errors the resulting position fix is also subject to error. Although in theory two lines of position (LOP) are enough to define a point, in practice 'crossing' more LOPs provides greater accuracy and confidence, especially if the lines cross at a good angle to each other. Three LOPs are considered the minimum for a practical navigational fix. The three LOPs when drawn on the chart will in general form a triangle, known as a 'cocked hat'. The navigator will have more confidence in a position fix that is formed by a small cocked hat with angles close to those of an equilateral triangle.|$|E
5000|$|In December 1932, {{the newly}} founded Silva Company of Sweden {{introduced}} its first baseplate or <b>bearing</b> <b>compass</b> that used a liquid-filled capsule to damp {{the swing of}} the magnetized needle. [...] The liquid-damped Silva took only four seconds for its needle to settle in comparison to thirty seconds for the original version.|$|R
50|$|On {{aircraft}} or vessels {{there are}} three types of bearing: true, magnetic, and <b>compass</b> <b>bearing.</b> <b>Compass</b> error {{is divided into two}} parts, namely magnetic variation and magnetic deviation, the latter originating from magnetic properties of the vessel or aircraft. Variation and deviation are signed quantities. As discussed above, positive (easterly) variation indicates that magnetic north is east of geographic north.|$|R

5000|$|A {{grid bearing}} is {{measured}} {{in relation to the}} fixed horizontal reference plane of grid north, that is, using the direction northwards along the grid lines of the map projection as a reference point, while a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing,</b> as in vehicle or marine navigation, {{is measured in}} relation to the magnetic compass of the navigator's vehicle or vessel (if aboard ship). It should be very close to the magnetic bearing. The difference between a magnetic <b>bearing</b> and a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> is the deviation caused to the compass by ferrous metals and local magnetic fields generated by any variety of vehicle or shipboard sources (steel vehicle bodies/frames or vessel hulls, ignition systems, etc.) ...|$|R

50|$|Magnetic {{deviation}} is {{the angle}} from a given magnetic bearing to the related bearing {{mark of the}} compass. Deviation is positive if a <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> mark (e.g., <b>compass</b> north) is right of the related magnetic bearing (e.g., magnetic north) and vice versa. For example, if the boat is aligned to magnetic north and the compass' north mark points 3° more east, deviation is +3°. Deviation varies for every compass in the same location and depends on such factors as the magnetic field of the vessel, wristwatches, etc. The value also varies depending on {{the orientation of the}} boat. Magnets and/or iron masses can correct for deviation, so that a particular compass accurately displays magnetic bearings. More commonly, however, a correction card lists errors for the compass, which can then be compensated for arithmetically. Deviation must be added to <b>compass</b> <b>bearing</b> to obtain magnetic bearing.|$|R

50|$|Electronic support {{measures}} (ESM) or Electronic Surveillance Measures are really ELINT techniques using various Electronic Surveillance Systems, but {{the term is}} used in the specific context of tactical warfare. ESM give the information needed for electronic attack (EA) such as jamming, or directional <b>bearings</b> (<b>compass</b> angle) to a target in signals intercept such as in the HUFF-DUFF Radio Direction Finding (RDF) systems so critically important during the WW-II Battle of the Atlantic. After WW-II, the RDF originally applied in only communications was broadened into systems to also take in ELINT from radar bandwidths and lower frequency communications systems, giving birth to a family of NATO ESM systems, such as the shipboard US AN/WLR-1 - AN/WLR-6 systems and comparable airborne units. EA is also called electronic counter-measures (ECM). ESM provides information needed for electronic counter-counter measures (ECCM), such as understanding a spoofing or jamming mode so one can change one's radar characteristics to avoid them.|$|R
50|$|The {{indirect}} reading compass has graduations on the bezel. These graduations are clockwise {{round the}} face, and the zero mark {{coincides with the}} notch. To take a <b>bearing</b> the <b>compass</b> must first be aligned with the direction, then the bezel must be turned so that the notch aligns with the north point of the card or needle, and the bearing can then be read {{at the far side}} of the compass.|$|R

The feet were much larger than the hands, with the fifth metatarsal forming a hook shape. The halluxes were more slender than the other toes and the marginal ones could not touch the ground. Being a crurotarsan, the heel and ankle of Postosuchus resemble those of modern crocodiles.|$|R
