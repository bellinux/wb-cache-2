5|$|Soon {{after the}} {{establishment}} of the revolutionary committee, however, a faction opposing Pan emerged and sought to remove him from power. Pan became involved in factional violence. He jailed people from the rival faction, including party members and ordinary people. His supporters and opponents fought each other in major armed conflicts, and Pan <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> disagreements with the local military leadership. In June 1971, the central government dismissed him from his posts and put him under investigation.|$|E

Kulesza eventually relented and allowed the goalkeeper to travel with the team.|$|E
5|$|The Nazi {{government}} quickly {{negotiated a}} deal in which the Swiss burned the Bf 110under the supervision of German observers {{in return for a}} sale to the Swiss of 12new Bf 109G-6 Gustav to replace combat losses. The new fighters were delivered in batches of six on 20and 22May. The new planes <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> manufacturing defects from the poor workmanship and production disruptions caused by Allied bombings, and after complaints the Germans refunded half of the six million Swiss franc purchase price.|$|E
5|$|A {{reversal}} agent for benzodiazepines exists, flumazenil (Anexate). Its {{use as an}} antidote is not routinely recommended {{because of the high}} risk of resedation and seizures. In a double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of 326 people, 4 people <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> adverse events and 61% became resedated following the use of flumazenil. Numerous contraindications to its use exist. It is contraindicated in people with a history of long-term use of benzodiazepines, those having ingested a substance that lowers the seizure threshold or may cause an arrhythmia, and in those with abnormal vital signs. One study found that only 10% of the people presenting with a benzodiazepine overdose are suitable candidates for treatment with flumazenil.|$|E

30|$|Beginning in the 2008 June CPS, the {{respondents}} were asked the following six questions on disability: (i) whether they have difficulty dressing or bathing; (ii) whether they are deaf or <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty hearing; (iii) whether they are blind or <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty seeing even when wearing glasses; (iv) whether they have difficulty doing errands alone such as visiting a doctor's office or shopping because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition; (v) whether they <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty walking or climbing stairs; and (vi) whether they <b>have</b> <b>serious</b> difficulty concentrating, remembering, or making decisions because of a physical, mental, or emotional condition. Since the ATUS sample is drawn from {{those who participated in}} the CPS, the responses to these questions are available for all ATUS WB respondents. Freedman et al. (2012) show that regardless of measures of subjective well-being, older married adults with disability reported worse subjective well-being than those without disability.|$|R
5|$|All {{but two of}} the {{handcart}} companies {{successfully completed}} the rugged journey, with relatively few problems and only a few deaths. However, the fourth and fifth companies, known as the Willie and Martin Companies, respectively, <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> problems. The companies left Iowa City, Iowa, in July 1856, very late to begin the trip across the plains. They met severe winter weather west of present-day Casper, Wyoming, and continued to cope with deep snow and storms {{for the remainder of the}} journey. Food supplies were soon exhausted. Young organized a rescue effort that brought the companies in, but more than 210 of the 980 emigrants in the two parties died.|$|E
5|$|Hitler later {{blamed the}} failure of his {{invasion}} of the Soviet Union, {{which had to be}} delayed, on Mussolini's failed conquest of Greece. The theory that the Battle of Greece delayed the invasion of the Soviet Union has been refuted by the majority of historians, who have accused Hitler of trying to deflect blame from himself to his ally, Italy. It nevertheless <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> consequences for the Axis war effort in the North African theatre. Enno von Rintelen, who was the military attaché in Rome, emphasizes from the German point of view, the strategic mistake of not taking Malta.|$|E
5|$|In May 1938, Bush {{accepted}} a prestigious appointment {{as president of}} the Carnegie Institution of Washington (CIW), which had been founded in Washington, D.C. Also known as the Carnegie Institution for Science, it had an endowment of $33 million, and annually spent $1.5 million in research, most of which was carried out at its eight major laboratories. Bush became its president on January 1, 1939, with a salary of $25,000. He was now able to influence research policy in the United States at the highest level, and could informally advise the government on scientific matters. Bush soon discovered that the CIW <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> financial problems, and he had to ask the Carnegie Corporation for additional funding.|$|E

5|$|Sullivan never married, but he <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> {{love affairs}} with several women. The first was with Rachel Scott Russell (1845–1882), the {{daughter}} of the engineer John Scott Russell. Sullivan was a frequent visitor at the Scott Russell home in the mid-1860s, and by 1865 the affair was in full bloom. Rachel's parents did not approve of a possible union with a young composer with uncertain financial prospects, but the two continued to see each other covertly. At some point in 1868, Sullivan started a simultaneous (and secret) affair with Rachel's sister Louise (1841–1878). Both relationships had ceased by early 1869.|$|E
5|$|Tinker <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> health {{problems}} {{in his later}} life. Complications of diabetes mellitus and Bright's disease left Tinker near death in 1936, when his physician believed he had 24 hours to live, and 1944, when he was placed in an oxygen tent. However, he returned to health and scouted minor league players for the Boston Braves in 1946. Tinker developed an infection relating to diabetes that in 1947 required the amputation of a toe and persisted until his left leg above the knee was amputated as well. Tinker died at Orange Memorial Hospital in Orlando on July 27, 1948, his 68th birthday, of complications from diabetes. He was buried in Greenwood Cemetery and survived by his four children.|$|E
5|$|While {{the outcome}} of the battle was still undecided, a second British frigate——arrived. Outnumbered, the French captain saw no {{alternative}} and surrendered his ship. The late arrival of Arethusa—under Captain Robert Mends, who claimed the victory for himself—sparked a furious argument that developed into a lasting animosity between Mends and Captain Michael Seymour of Amethyst. The failure of Niémen to reach Isle de France also <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> repercussions for the French squadron there. With naval supplies severely limited, their ability to operate at sea {{for long periods of time}} was hampered and by late 1810 few of their vessels were still seaworthy.|$|E

5|$|With through running {{between the}} lines in place, in June 1899 the MR {{inspected}} the O's carriages and locomotives, and <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> concerns. The original passenger carriage began as a horse tram and was shabby internally, and unsafe {{as part of a}} longer train. The passenger carriage from the 1870s was in a poor condition. The 1895 Bristol passenger carriages were unfit owing to their light construction. Eight of the O's nine goods wagons did not comply with Railway Clearing House standards and could not be used on other lines. On 4 October 1899 the MR loaned the O an eight-wheeled 70seat passenger carriage. As this had been built for the MR's standard height platforms rather than the O's low platforms, 80–100ft (24–30m) of each platform on the Tramway was raised to standard height to accommodate the MR carriage.|$|E
5|$|French {{casualties}} in the engagement are uncertain due to the circumstances of Confiantes destruction, but based on Acklom's report from the boarding party they {{were believed to be}} heavy. British losses were negligible, with not one man killed or seriously wounded and only minor damage inflicted on Hydra and none on the smaller vessels. The conduct of Lieutenant Lecolier was the subject of much criticism in France after the battle; in the French history Victories et Conquêtes, Lecolier was accused of failing to support Pevrieux and grounding his ship while the outcome of the battle was still undecided. British historian William James is less critical of Lecolier, focusing much of the blame for the French defeat on the more senior Pevrieux. The restriction of French movement along their own coastline <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> effects {{for the development of the}} French forces in the region and played a significant role in the failure of the French to pose a realistic invasion threat to Britain.|$|E
5|$|In {{view of the}} board's lack of urgency, C {{took nearly}} a year to {{research}} this project. The proposed main battery of eight 14-inch guns was kept constant while other factors were calculated—speeds of 26, 29 and 32 knots; operating ranges of 5000, 7000 and 8000 miles; and belt armor of 8, 11 and 14 inches. On 12 July 1912, Naval Constructor R.H. Robinson presented these studies at a lecture he gave at the Naval War College with the General Board in attendance. There, he emphasized 8 inches as an absolute minimum for armor protection and recommended a radius of 8000 miles, {{the same as in}} U.S. battleships. The General Board's reaction was to request two battlecruisers for the 1914 Naval Building Program and ask C for a slightly modified version of the proposed ship, but the Naval War College felt the design <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> problems and that a fast battleship would be a more practical option.|$|E

5|$|McKinley {{left office}} as {{governor}} in January 1896. In February, Harrison {{made it clear}} that he would not seek a third nomination. Hanna's operatives immediately organized Harrison's home state of Indiana for McKinley with a haste that the former president privately found unseemly. By early 1896, the Reed and Allison campaigns were beginning to form themselves, but they had little luck in Indiana. McKinley challenged his rivals everywhere except in states, such as Iowa, that he deemed <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> candidates like Senator Allison. The favorite son candidacies of Minnesota Senator Cushman K. Davis and former Nebraska senator Charles F. Manderson fell victim to the McKinley forces, well-financed by Hanna, who took their states away from them. McKinley was disliked by the American Protective Association, an anti-Catholic group angered that as governor he had appointed to office members of that faith. Their wide pamphleting caused Hanna to act against falsehoods that his candidate was a Catholic.|$|E
5|$|The Kaqchikel {{people were}} {{closely related to}} the K'iche', their former allies. The K'iche'an peoples (including the Kaqchikel, the K'iche' and others) had {{received}} strong influences from central Mexico since the time of the great Early Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan. The history of Iximche is largely drawn from the Annals of the Kaqchikels, a document written in the Kaqchikel language but using Latin characters soon after the Spanish Conquest. This document details the origins, history and conquest of the Kaqchikels. The Kaqchikel served as close allies of the K'iche' for many years. The Kaqchikel rulers Hun-Toh and Wuqu-Batz' served the great K'iche' king K'iq'ab with such loyalty that he rewarded them with the royal titles Ahpo Sotz'il and Ahpo Xahil and the power to rule. The sons of K'iq'ab became jealous of the growing power of the Kaqchikel lords and led a revolt against their father that seriously damaged his authority. This revolt <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> consequences for the K'iche' as their conquered domains seized the opportunity to break free from their subjugation.|$|E
5|$|In September 1916, the Serbian High Command sent then-Lieutenant Pećanac by air to Mehane (south-west of Niš in the Toplica region) {{to prepare}} a guerrilla {{uprising}} {{in support of a}} planned Allied offensive. There, Pećanac contacted several groups of guerrillas, known as comitadji. Pećanac joined forces with local leader Kosta Vojinović, and they both established headquarters on Mount Kopaonik. Rivalry quickly developed between the two leaders, mainly because Pećanac only had orders to prepare to support the planned Allied offensive, but Vojinović was conducting operations that might result in pre-emptive action by the Bulgarian occupation forces. Matters came to a head in January– February 1917 when the Bulgarians began conscripting local Serbs for military service. At a meeting of guerrilla leaders to discuss whether they should commence a general uprising, Pećanac was outvoted. However, events had overtaken the leaders, and they were essentially joining a popular uprising that was already underway. After guerrillas under Pećanac's command engaged the Bulgarians, he was hailed as a leader of the resistance, although he <b>had</b> <b>serious</b> reservations about the eventual outcome once the Bulgarians and Austro-Hungarians committed large numbers of troops to subdue the uprising. The guerrillas were closing on Niš in early March when the occupying forces went on the offensive. Pećanac advised his fighters to hide out in the woods and mountains, while Vojinović ordered his to fight to the death. By 25 March, the uprising had been crushed. Pećanac's participation in the rebellion came at a great personal cost; three of his children died whilst in Bulgarian internment.|$|E
