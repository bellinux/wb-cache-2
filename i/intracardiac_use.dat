In experimental study, the effects of this pulsatile pressure revealed significant superiority compared with that of continuous or constant negative suction in respect of the sucking and returning the blood to the extracorporeal circuit. Maximal capacity of this suction was 4, 000 m? per minute with 30 mmHg negative pressure for 1. 2 second in each every 1. 8 second.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{verapamil}} and related phenylalkylamines on neuronal excitability were investigated in isolated neurons of rat <b>intracardiac</b> ganglia <b>using</b> whole-cell perforated patch-clamp recording. Verapamil (≥ 10 μM) inhibits tonic firing observed {{in response to}} depolarizing current pulses at 22 °C. The inhibition of discharge activity is not due to block of voltage-dependent Ca 2 + channels because firing is not affected by 100 μM Cd 2 +. The K+ channel inhibitors charybdotoxin (100 nM), 4 -aminopyridine (0. 5 mM), apamin (30 - 100 nM), and tetraethylammonium ions (1 mM) also {{have no effect on}} firing behavior at 22 °C. Verapamil does not antagonize the acetylcholine-induced inhibition of the muscarine-sensitive K+ current (M- current) in rat intracardiac neurons. Verapamil inhibits the delayed outwardly rectifying K+ current with an IC 50 value of 11 μM, which is approximately 7 -fold more potent than its inhibition of high voltage- activated Ca 2 + channel currents. These data suggest that verapamil inhibits tonic firing in rat intracardiac neurons primarily via inhibition of delayed outwardly rectifying K+ current.

40|$|Objective: Assessing {{the role}} of MSCT {{compared}} to TTE in pediatric patients with congenital heart diseases especially the thoracic congenital vascular anomalies. Methods: 54 pediatric patients underwent a 128 detectors computed tomography cardiac angiography with retrospective ECG-gating. Images were reviewed based on segmental approach using the operative data (35 / 54 patients) or cardiac catheterization (19 / 54 patients) findings as reference standard. Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values and accuracy of TTE and MDCT were evaluated. Results: MDCT was superior to TTE in evaluating vascular lesions (aortic, conotruncal, coronary artery, major aorto-pulmonary collaterals, patent ductus arteriosus, venous anomalies and postoperative complications) as well as pulmonary lesions; while TTE was superior in intracardiac anomalies with equal performance in (pulmonary artery anomalies, concordance and valvular atresia). MDCT achieved (100 %, 96. 3 % and 87 %) accuracies compared to TTE (94. 4 %, 85. 2 % & 96. 3 %) for delineating isolated vascular anomalies, complex vascular anomalies and intracardiac anomalies respectively.

40|$|Rationale: Recent {{evidence}} indicates that a few human microRNAs (miRNAs), in particular hsa-miR- 199 a- 3 p and hsa-miR- 590 - 3 p, stimulate proliferation of cardiomyocytes and, once expressed in the mouse heart using viral vectors, induce cardiac regeneration after myocardial infarction. Viral vectors, however, are not devoid of safety issues and, more notably, drive expression of the encoded miRNAs for indefinite periods of time, which might not be desirable in light of human therapeutic application. Objective: As {{an alternative to the}} use of viral vectors, we wanted to assess the efficacy of synthetic miRNA mimics in inducing myocardial repair after single <b>intracardiac</b> injection <b>using</b> synthetic lipid formulations. Methods and Results: We comparatively analyzed the efficacy of different lipid formulations in delivering hsamiR- 199 a- 3 p and hsa-miR- 590 - 3 p both in primary neonatal mouse cardiomyocytes and in vivo. We established a transfection protocol allowing persistence of these 2 mimics for at least 12 days after a single intracardiac injection, with minimal dispersion to other organs and long-term preservation of miRNA functional activity, as assessed by monitoring the expression of 2 mRNA targets. Administration of this synthetic formulation immediately after myocardial infarction in mice resulted in marked reduction of infarct size and persistent recovery of cardiac function.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Paradoxical {{embolization}} {{through a}} right-to-left shunt (RLS), often from a patent foramen ovale (PFO), {{has been associated}} with cryptogenic stroke. While transesophageal echo (TEE) bubble study is the current standard reference for diagnosing PFO, transthoracic echo (TTE) remains the most commonly used screening test for RLS due to its noninvasiveness and easy availability. The aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the accuracy of TTE compared to TEE as the reference. METHODS AND RESULTS: A systematic review of Medline, Cochrane, and Embase was done to look for all the prospective studies assessing for <b>intracardiac</b> RLS <b>using</b> conventional TTE compared to TEE as the reference; both TTE and TEE were performed with a contrast agent and a maneuver to provoke RLS in all studies. A total of 13 studies with 1436 patients fulfilled the inclusion criteria. The weighted mean sensitivity and specificity for TTE were 46 % and 99 %, respectively. Likewise, the positive likelihood ratio and negative likelihood ratio were 20. 85 and 0. 57, respectively. Using different contrast agents, different microbubble cutoffs for a positive TTE/TEE, and different cardiac cycle cutoffs for a positive TTE/TEE did not affect the accuracy of TTE. In a population of patients with cryptogenic stroke, a TTE that tests positive for RLS has a 95 % probability of being a true positive. CONCLUSION: Transthoracic echocardiogram has a low sensitivity and extremely high specificity, making it a poor rule out test but an excellent rule in test for the detection of intracardiac RLS...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. This {{study was}} {{designed}} to determine the clinical utility and feasibility of using 12. 5 -MHz ultrasound catheters for intracardiac echocardiography. Background. Intracardiac echocardiography is a potentially useful technique of cardiac imaging and monitoring in certain settings. The feasibility of <b>intracardiac</b> echocardiography <b>using</b> 20 -MHz ultrasound catheters in patients has been demonstrated. High resolution images of normal cardiac structures as well as cardiac abnormalities have been obtained. However, imaging has been limited by the shallow depth of field inherent in high frequency ultrasound imaging. Methods. Intracardiac echocardiography with 12. 5 -MHz catheters was performed in eight mongrel dogs and 92 patients. Catheters were introduced percutaneously in 86 patients studied in the catheterization laboratory and directly into the heart in 12 patients in the operating room. Right heart imaging was performed in 68 patients and arterial and left heart imaging in 35 patients. Results. When these catheters were introduced into the venous system, the right atrium, tricuspid valve, right ventricle, pulmonary valve and pulmonary artery were visualized. Pericardial effusion, intracardiac masses and atrial septal defects were correctly identified. The left ventricle, left atrium, mitral valve, aortic valve, aorta and coronary arteries could be imaged from the arterial circulation. Diseases identified included valvular aortic stenosis, subvalvular aortic stenosis and Kawasaki disease. Average imaging time was 10 min. No complications occurred as a result of intracardiac echocardiography. Conclusions. Intracardiac echocardiography with 12. 5 -MHz ultrasound catheters is safe and feasible; it also provides anatomic and physiologic information.

Membrane oscillations were temporarily inhibited by hyperpolarizing current pulses and potentiated by weak depolarizing current pulses. The amplitude of oscillations was reduced upon lowering the external Na+ concentration and inhibited by tetrodotoxin (TTX), tetracaine or Zn 2 +. Tetraethylammonium, 4 -aminopyridine, Cs+, Cd 2 +, Ba 2 +, 1, 4, 4 ′-diothiocyanato- 2, 2 ′-stilbenedisulphonic acid (DIDS) and ouabain {{had no effect on}} the CTX- 1 -induced membrane depolarization and oscillations. Brevetoxin (PbTx- 3, 100 nM), in contrast to CTX- 1, caused a membrane depolarization that was not associated with oscillation of the membrane potential. Under voltage-clamp conditions, P-CTX- 1 inhibited the peak amplitude of the voltage-dependent Na+ current and shifted the activation curve to more negative potentials, but membrane oscillations were not seen in this configuration. These results suggest that ciguatoxins cause oscillation of the membrane potential in mammalian autonomic neurons by modifying the activation and inactivation properties of a population of TTX-sensitive Na+ channels...|$|R
40|$|Objective: Pectus excavatum may {{be present}} in patient {{requiring}} operations for cardiac defects. The study was undertaken {{in order to assess}} our simultaneous repairs of pectus excavatum and congenital heart disease over past 30 years. Methods: Between 1970 and 2000, 12 patients underwent simultaneous repair of pectus excavatum and congenital heart disease. Six of 12 patients had ventricular septal defects as cardiac malformations (subgroup A). Operative technique, after the <b>intracardiac</b> procedure <b>using</b> cardiopulmonary bypass, consists of total subperichondrial resection of deformed costal cartilages, transection of deformed portion of the sternum in 2 – 3 points, and fixation of the sternum in elevated position using two Kirschner wires and a bridge external traction. Postoperative catheterization was performed in five of 12 patients (subgroup B). We evaluated the operative data, the improvement of pectus deformity and right ventricular performance retro-spectively. The operative data in subgroup A were compared with those in recent random patients with ventricular septal defects only or with pectus excavatum only (control groups). Results: There was no operative death and non-serious complications were seen in nine patients (atelectasis in six, superficial wound infection in two, chylothorax in one). Pectus deformities improved with the drop of vertebral index postoperatively. The mean total operative time and postoperative drainage in subgroup A were 128. 4 % and 123. 7 %, respectively of those in the ventricular septal defect control group. The mean perioperative bleeding in subgroup A was {{more than the sum of}} those in control groups. Right ventricular end-diastolic (RVEDVI), end-systolic (RVESVI), stroke (RVSVI) volume indices and ejection fraction (RVEF) in subgroup B tended to increase after surgery. In particular, there were significant increases of RVEDVI (35 %, P, 0 : 05) and RVSV...|$|R
