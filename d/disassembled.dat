5|$|A {{claim was}} made on 17 January 2006, by now former {{developer}} Hartmut Birr on the ReactOS developers mailing list (ros-dev) that ReactOS contained code derived from disassembling Microsoft Windows. The code that Birr disputed involved the function BadStack in syscall.S. {{as well as other}} unspecified items. Comparing this function to <b>disassembled</b> binaries from Windows XP, Birr argued that the BadStack function was simply copy-pasted from Windows XP, given that they were identical. Alex Ionescu, the author of the code, asserted that while the Windows XP binary in question was indeed <b>disassembled</b> and studied, the code was not merely copy-pasted, but reimplemented; the reason why the functions were identical, Ionescu claimed, was because there was only one possible way to implement the function.|$|E
5|$|On 4 June 1915, {{after being}} <b>disassembled</b> into three {{sections}} and transported by rail to Pola for reassembling, UB-1 was {{handed over to}} the Austro-Hungarian Navy and commissioned as U-10 under the command of Linienschiffsleutnant Karl Edler von Unczowski.|$|E
5|$|Piers, {{ideal for}} landing of troops, and {{situated}} {{in large numbers}} along the south coast of England, were <b>disassembled,</b> blocked or otherwise destroyed. Many piers were not repaired until the late 1940s or early 1950s.|$|E

Cofilin is recognized as a key regulator that promotes actin depolymerization. In this study, we show that although pure cofilin can <b>disassemble</b> Listeria monocytogenes actin comet tails, it cannot efficiently <b>disassemble</b> comet tails in the presence of polymerizable actin.

Its components would be moved from the hold by the aircraft crane to the after deck where it could be assembled. Then the aircraft would be swayed over the side where it could be launched.|$|E
5|$|From 1973 to 1987, 1947 IE alum Pete George {{maintained}} the Ramblin' Wreck at the Hapeville Ford Plant. George would mastermind the 1974 change of colors {{as well as}} a major refurbishment of the Wreck in 1982 in time for Georgia Tech's 1985 centennial celebration. The car was completely <b>disassembled,</b> rebuilt, and repainted by late 1982.|$|E
5|$|German {{soldiers}} of Army Group North <b>disassembled</b> the Amber Room within 36 hours {{under the supervision}} of two experts. On 14 October 1941, the priceless room reached Königsberg in East Prussia, for storage and display in the town's castle. On 13 November 1941, a Königsberg newspaper announced an exhibition of the Amber Room at Königsberg Castle.|$|E

5|$|In April 2007, the NIST's {{implementation}} of the Kibble balance demonstrated a combined relative standard uncertainty (CRSU) of 36µg and a short-term resolution of µg. The UK's National Physical Laboratory's Kibble balance demonstrated a CRSU of 70.3µg in 2007. That Kibble balance was <b>disassembled</b> and shipped in 2009 to Canada's Institute for National Measurement Standards (part of the National Research Council), where research and development with the device could continue.|$|E
5|$|November 2010 saw {{the first}} {{performances}} on the organ after an 18-month renovation by its original builders Harrison & Harrison, costing around £800,000. The organ had been <b>disassembled</b> {{and some of it}} taken away to the builders' workshop in Durham. The pipes were cleaned and the leather of the bellows was replaced. The manuals were also fitted with an electronic panel for storing combinations of stop settings.|$|E
5|$|The {{change in}} {{structural}} material from masonry to iron allowed Bartholdi {{to change his}} plans for the statue's assembly.

5|$|After the war, the Enola Gay {{returned}} to the United States, where it was operated from Roswell Army Air Field, New Mexico. In May 1946, it was flown to Kwajalein for the Operation Crossroads nuclear tests in the Pacific, but was not chosen to make the test drop at Bikini Atoll. Later that year it {{was transferred to the}} Smithsonian Institution, and spent many years parked at air bases exposed to the weather and souvenir hunters, before being <b>disassembled</b> and transported to the Smithsonian's storage facility at Suitland, Maryland, in 1961.|$|E
5|$|During the {{production}} run, the Navy {{decided to move}} the Chance Vought factory from Stratford, Connecticut to a much larger facility in Dallas, Texas which had been vacant {{since the end of}} World War II; this badly disrupted {{the production}} of the Pirate. The airframes were built in Stratford and trucked to Dallas where government-furnished equipment, such as the engines and afterburners, were installed. The completed aircraft were then taxied around the new plant's airfield, but the runway was deemed too short to handle jets. The aircraft had to be <b>disassembled</b> and trucked to an abandoned airfield at Ardmore, Oklahoma with a runway long enough for acceptance testing.|$|E
5|$|In New Guinea, {{a country}} without roads, {{large-scale}} transportation {{of men and}} materiel {{would have to be}} accomplished by aircraft or ships. A multi-pronged approach was employed to solve this problem. <b>Disassembled</b> landing craft were shipped to Australia, where they were assembled in Cairns. The range of these small landing craft was to be greatly extended by the landing ships of the VII Amphibious Force, which began arriving in late 1942, and formed part of the newly formed Seventh Fleet. Since the Seventh Fleet had no aircraft carriers, the range of naval operations was limited by that of the fighter aircraft of the Fifth Air Force.|$|E

5|$|In a {{statement}} on its website, ReactOS cited differing legal definitions of what constitutes clean-room reverse engineering as a cause for the conflict. Some countries, including the United States, require that a reimplementation based on <b>disassembled</b> code must be written by someone other than the person having <b>disassembled</b> and examined the original code, whereas other countries allow both tasks to be performed by the same individual. Consequently, ReactOS clarified that its Intellectual Property Policy Statement requirements on clean room reverse engineering conform to US law. An internal source code audit was conducted to ensure that only clean room reverse engineering was used, and all developers were made to sign an agreement committing them {{to comply with the}} project's policies on reverse engineering. Contributors to its development were not affected by these events, and all access to the software development tools was restored shortly afterward. In September 2007, with the audit nearing completion, the audit status was removed from the ReactOS homepage. Though the audit was completed, specific details were not made public as it was only an internal effort to ensure compliance with the project's own policies.|$|E
5|$|In the 1930s, {{all three}} members of the class were {{modified}} to carry a pair of float planes for reconnaissance. They were equipped with an aircraft catapult to launch the planes and cranes to recover them after they landed in the water. The ships initially carried two Heinkel He 60 biplane float planes, replaced later in the decade with two Arado Ar 196 monoplane float planes. Only one aircraft could be stored on the catapult at a time; the second plane had to be <b>disassembled</b> and placed in storage, and the ships did not have a hangar to store it in.|$|E
5|$|It {{is used in}} {{external}} beam radiotherapy, sterilization of medical supplies and medical waste, radiation treatment of foods for sterilization (cold pasteurization), industrial radiography (e.g. weld integrity radiographs), density measurements (e.g. concrete density measurements), and tank fill height switches. The metal has the unfortunate property of producing a fine dust, causing problems with radiation protection. Cobalt from radiotherapy machines has been a serious hazard when not discarded properly, {{and one of the}} worst radiation contamination accidents in North America occurred in 1984, when a discarded radiotherapy unit containing cobalt-60 was mistakenly <b>disassembled</b> in a junkyard in Juarez, Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Like the {{components}} of other intermediate filaments, the lamin monomer contains an alpha-helical domain used by two monomers to coil around each other, forming a dimer structure called a coiled coil. Two of these dimer structures then join side by side, in an antiparallel arrangement, to form a tetramer called a protofilament. Eight of these protofilaments form a lateral arrangement that is twisted to form a ropelike filament. These filaments can be assembled or <b>disassembled</b> in a dynamic manner, meaning that changes in {{the length of the}} filament depend on the competing rates of filament addition and removal.|$|E
5|$|Longren {{obtained}} {{space in}} Topeka {{for a small}} factory and {{enlisted the help of}} his brother Ereanius and his friend William Janicke, a fellow mechanic. Together the three men began working on Longren's design for a new airplane, despite having no prior aviation experience or professional assistance. The trio built the prototype in complete secrecy, wishing to forestall publicity of any potential failures; they even <b>disassembled</b> the craft and transported it discreetly in boxes to its first flight trial.|$|E
