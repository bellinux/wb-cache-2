40|$|This study aims {{to explore}} {{the meaning of the}} concept of {{creativity}} from the perspective of student teachers pursuing a one year teacher training course following their first degree. Seventeen student teachers following a specialist music teaching route in secondary education were selected as the sample for this study to offer their understanding on creativity in the secondary music classroom. Data were collected through questionnaires and semi-structured interviews and were subject to in-depth qualitative analysis using Atlas. ti software. All student teachers seemed eager to teach for creativity as they thought it was a vital component of their pupils’ musical engagement and development. However, some held richer conceptions than others or tended to overlook significant areas of musical involvement, such as improvisation, group work and engagement in evaluating and refining the creative musical product. Creativity was generally expected but it would emerge on an intuitive level as a by-product of a learning objective rather than being explicitly considered in the planning process. These narrow conceptions of the meaning of creativity <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> need to be taken seriously and explicitly addressed in music education programs in order to maximize the expression of pupils’ creative potential <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> and beyond. ...|$|E

Finally, this research compared <b>the</b> <b>classroom</b> environment <b>in</b> <b>the</b> choral <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> with a normative sample of representative high school classes.

Students in programs with proportionate Hispanic enrollment report a lower level of affiliation, less competition between students, and a lower level of teacher control. There is also a difference <b>in</b> <b>the</b> assessment of the classroom environment among Hispanic students, White students and students who are neither Hispanic nor White. Hispanic students feel less affiliation with the choir regardless of program enrollment. In addition, there was an interaction effect with regards to innovation.

40|$|This {{qualitative}} {{study was designed}} to ascertain the perceptions of music educators, curriculum specialists and principals regarding music and literacy integration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom.</b> Six elementary music teachers from a diversity of school districts and representative of varied socio-economic school backgrounds were interviewed in-depth. Three school principals and three curriculum specialists were also interviewed with similar questions in order to enrich the understanding of their own perceptions of the inclusion of music and literacy integration <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom.</b> 	To ensure quality and validity of interview questions and that they accurately reflected the meaning and purpose of the research questions, only those questions that were positively rated by a pilot group were included in the interview protocol. The data were collected through semi-structured interviews. Using the computer software HyperRESEARCH, the interview data was inventoried, organized and coded. All participants reflected on the functionality of music education to further the development or reinforcement of literacy skills. In addition, participants mentioned a diversity of activities occurring <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>music</b> <b>classroom</b> that facilitate music and literacy integration such as reading music-related literature, performing speech pieces, song composition, and visually tracking iconic representations. Music teachers expressed that approaches such as Kodály, which emphasizes sound before symbol, and Orff, with an emphasis on speech and rhythmic activities, align with the integration of music and literacy. Most teachers reported feeling quite confident with this strategy. According to participants’ perceptions, schools lack specific music and literacy integration professional development. Additional research is certainly needed regarding the commonalities between music and literacy. Also, additional research regarding music and literacy integration professional development for educators should be performed in order to purposefully design and plan these opportunities. In addition to training, music teachers, classroom teachers and curriculum specialists should combine their areas of expertise in collaboration in order to research, plan and design effective music and literacy integration activities that they all can use in their respective classrooms.
