5|$|A {{trademark}} dispute {{involving the}} owners of the identically named Burger King in Mattoon, Illinois led to a federal lawsuit; the case's outcome helped define the scope of the Lanham act and trademark law in the United States. An existing trademark held by a shop of the same name in South Australia forced the company to change its name in Australia, while another state trademark in Texas forced the company to abandon its signature product, the Whopper, in several counties around San Antonio.

5|$|Ashurst Turner Gilbert {{was elected}} Principal in 1822, aged only 35; he had secured the {{fellowship}} in 1809 {{on the strength}} of a first. He disliked teaching – although he admitted <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> the bills – and much preferred being Principal. There, he would be eventually made Vice-Chancellor of the University and later Bishop of Chichester. Gilbert committed Brasenose to a cause of neutral politics and mainstream Anglicanism, strongly rejecting Tractarian and Evangelical ideas including supporting the censure of Dr. Renn D. Hampden. His time was spent pre-occupied with the religious tensions of the University, having spent time opposing changes to religious services in Oxford on behalf of Oxford Tories.|$|E

5|$|Among the company's {{other goals}} {{was that of}} helping finance road {{projects}} on Øygarden. The most pressing issue was the section from Kolltveit on Store Sotra to the bridge, part of National Road 555. In 1976, the company issued NOK5 million in an interest-free loan to the project, which was repaid in 1982 and 1983. Similar conditions were imposed for NOK2 million for National Road 561 to Nordra Straumsundet and NOK1.2 million {{for the establishment of}} the Solsvik–Rong Ferry in 1974. The rest of the subsidies were given as grants. The main project was National Road 561, which ran from Kollveit northwards through Øygarden, for which the company paid NOK28.6 million. <b>It</b> <b>paid</b> a further NOK9.3 million for other projects in Sotra and Øygarden, including connections to Turøy and Misje.|$|E
5|$|As {{managing}} director of the UERL from 1910, Stanley led further transport consolidation with the UERL's take-over of London General Omnibus Company (LGOC) in 1912 and the CLR and the C on 1 January 1913. The LGOC was the dominant bus operator in the capital and its high profitability (<b>it</b> <b>paid</b> dividends of 18 per cent compared with Underground Group companies' dividends of 1 to 3 per cent) subsidised the rest of the group. Through the UERL's shareholding in the London and Suburban Traction Company (LSTC), which it owned jointly with British Electric Traction, the UERL took control in 1913 of the London United Tramways, the Metropolitan Electric Tramways and the South Metropolitan Electric Tramways. The UERL also took control of bus builder AEC. The much enlarged group became known as the Combine. Only the MR (and its subsidiaries the Great Northern & City Railway and the East London Railway) and the W (by then fully owned by the London and South Western Railway) remained outside of the Underground Group's control.|$|E

One specialist area was heat-treated blades used to cut the cables of sea mines. In April 1916 an increase in share capital to expand the factory further was authorised. During the war years the company was misled by a trade union such that <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> its male fitters, who were supervising female war workers, an increased wage of 48 shillings per week. The union told the company it was the rate paid for similar work at Armstrong Whitworth, when it was not.|$|E

Tracey Ferguson, the Canadian player who knocked her down tried to block the way for Australian officials to help her up. Carter lost considerable mobility in her right arm, and required an elbow reconstruction. She spent 11 weeks on a continuous passive motion machine getting treatment. Nine operations were required to treat the elbow. Because she had a pre-existing condition, the insurance company refused {{to pay for her}} treatment, although <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> her $7,500 in return for agreeing not to take legal action. Carter carried a lot of anger towards the Canadian in the first year following her accident. By 2004, she still could not fully flex her hand. Following her accident, she occasionally required the use of an electric wheelchair because of the severity of her injury, and needed the assistance of the Council's Home Care to clean her home. Before 2000, she had mostly been coached by national team coach Peter Corr.|$|E

5|$|Since 1904, {{after the}} District had {{notified}} the Met {{that it would}} not use its running rights on the Uxbridge line with steam trains, it had not run services, although <b>it</b> <b>paid</b> the £2,000 a year that was due under the enabling Act. When the District suggested running as far as Rayners Lane, the Met responded with a proposal to rebuild the station as a District terminus. The District proposed running trains through to Uxbridge, leading to negotiations about the charges for traction current before District services were extended to Uxbridge on 1 March 1910. In 1910 a platform was built at Mill Hill Park for the Hounslow and Uxbridge shuttles and a flying junction built north of the station to separate the Ealing and Hounslow traffic. The station was renamed Acton Town on 1 March 1910.|$|E

Some sources state that the State Department discovered the plan when a senior official was asked to sign a certain document, while others suggest that Somoza was indiscreet.
