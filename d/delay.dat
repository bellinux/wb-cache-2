25|$|Like the {{marshmallow}} test, <b>delay</b> discounting {{is also a}} <b>delay</b> of gratification paradigm. It {{is designed}} around the principle that the subjective value of a reinforcer decreases, or is 'discounted,' as the <b>delay</b> to reinforcement increases. Subjects are given varying choices between smaller, immediate rewards and larger, delayed rewards. By manipulating reward magnitude and/or reward <b>delay</b> over multiple trials, 'indifference' points can be estimated whereby choosing the small, immediate reward, or the large, delayed reward are about equally likely. Subjects are labeled impulsive when their indifference points decline more steeply {{as a function of}} <b>delay</b> compared to the normal population (i.e., greater preference for immediate reward). Unlike the marshmallow test, <b>delay</b> discounting does not require verbal instruction and can be implemented on non-human animals.|$|E

40|$|Monitoring {{the sensory}} {{consequences}} of articulatory movements supports speaking. For example, <b>delaying</b> auditory feedback of a speaker's voice disrupts speech production. Also, {{there is evidence}} that this disruption may be decreased by immediate visual feedback, i. e., seeing one's own articulatory movements. It is, however, unknown whether <b>delayed</b> visual feedback affects speech production in fluent speakers. Here, the effects of <b>delayed</b> auditory and visual feedback on speech fluency (i. e., speech rate and errors), vocal control (i. e., intensity and pitch), and speech rhythm were investigated. Participants received <b>delayed</b> (by 200 [*]ms) or immediate auditory feedback, while repeating sentences. Moreover, they received either no visual feedback, immediate visual feedback, or <b>delayed</b> visual feedback (by 200, 400, and 600 [*]ms). <b>Delayed</b> auditory feedback affected fluency, vocal control, and rhythm. Immediate visual feedback had no effect on any of the speech measures when it was combined with <b>delayed</b> auditory feedback. <b>Delayed</b> visual feedback did, however, affect speech fluency when it was combined with <b>delayed</b> auditory feedback. In sum, the findings show that <b>delayed</b> auditory feedback disrupts fluency, vocal control, and rhythm and that <b>delayed</b> visual feedback can strengthen the disruptive effect of <b>delayed</b> auditory feedback on fluency...|$|R

30|$|In {{the real}} world, time <b>delays</b> are ubiquitous. They may cause complex {{dynamical}} {{behaviors such as}} periodic oscillations, dissipation, divergence and chaos [7, 8]. Hence, the dynamic behaviors of neural networks with time <b>delays</b> have received lots of attention [9 – 11]. The existing studies on <b>delayed</b> neural networks {{can be divided into}} four categories dealing with constant, time-varying, distribution, and mixed <b>delays.</b> While a majority of literature is concentrated on the former three simple cases, mixed <b>delays</b> are more effective than simple <b>delays</b> in MNNs [12 – 16].

40|$|Abstract Background Animals must {{frequently}} act {{to influence}} the world even when the reinforcing outcomes of their actions are <b>delayed.</b> Learning with action-outcome <b>delays</b> is a complex problem, and little is known of the neural mechanisms that bridge such <b>delays.</b> When outcomes are <b>delayed,</b> they {{may be attributed to}} (or associated with) the action that caused them, or mistakenly attributed to other stimuli, such as the environmental context. Consequently, animals that are poor at forming context-outcome associations might learn action-outcome associations better with <b>delayed</b> reinforcement than normal animals. The hippocampus contributes to the representation of environmental context, being required for aspects of contextual conditioning. We therefore hypothesized that animals with hippocampal lesions would be better than normal animals at learning to act on the basis of <b>delayed</b> reinforcement. We tested the ability of hippocampal-lesioned rats to learn a free-operant instrumental response using <b>delayed</b> reinforcement, and what is potentially a related ability – the ability to exhibit self-controlled choice, or to sacrifice an immediate, small reward in order to obtain a <b>delayed</b> but larger reward. Results Rats with sham or excitotoxic hippocampal lesions acquired an instrumental response with different <b>delays</b> (0, 10, or 20 s) between the response and reinforcer delivery. These <b>delays</b> retarded learning in normal rats. Hippocampal-lesioned rats responded slightly less than sham-operated controls in the absence of <b>delays,</b> but they became better at learning (relative to shams) as the <b>delays</b> increased; <b>delays</b> impaired learning less in hippocampal-lesioned rats than in shams. In contrast, lesioned rats exhibited impulsive choice, preferring an immediate, small reward to a <b>delayed,</b> larger reward, even though they preferred the large reward when it was not <b>delayed.</b> Conclusion These results support the view that the hippocampus hinders action-outcome learning with <b>delayed</b> outcomes, perhaps because it promotes the formation of context-outcome associations instead. However, although lesioned rats were better at learning with <b>delayed</b> reinforcement, they were worse at choosing it, suggesting that self-controlled choice and learning with <b>delayed</b> reinforcement tax different psychological processes. </p...|$|R
