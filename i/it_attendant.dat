40|$|The referee {{system in}} {{scholarly}} publishing offers us many benefits and also carries with <b>it</b> <b>attendant</b> problems. The problems {{need to be}} addressed. Referees are arguably the linchpins of academic scholarship: they do the heavy lifting for editors, they provide editors with vicarious expertise, and they monitor the gateway to publication and thus to tenure and promotion. Their presence in the editorial process is the guarantee to deans and program directors that scholarship is scholarship. Referees are also, however, the bottleneck of the publication system. Dilatory or slothful referees idly and thoughtlessly put careers on hold. The system needs changing. People with this much power should be trained. The only requirement for referees is the trust of an editor that the referee is knowledgeable in the subject area. Referee selection parallels {{the old way of}} publication where, as recently as the 1970 s, authors were published because they knew the editors. In publication, of course, there has been a (mostly) salubrious change. This change has not yet befallen the selection of the referee. Everyone who does it is an amateur at it, and, too often, it shows...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: There is {{significant}} evidence supporting an increased prevalence {{of depression in}} patients with COPD, but that depression is not a homogenous entity because there are multiple contributing etiologies for the depressive symptoms. Additionally the relationship between COPD and depression is neither exclusively linear, nor unidirectional. “Early onset ” depression is defined as depression that develops prior to the diagnosis of COPD, often during an individual’s youth. This is often reflective of a genetic vulnerability to depression which increases adolescents ’ risk for developing addiction to nicotine, setting up a life-long exposure to tobacco – the single greatest risk factor {{for the development of}} COPD. When COPD does develop it brings with <b>it</b> <b>attendant</b> losses, particularly in level of independent function and self image that contribute to a “reactive” depression that is not distinct from the losses experienced by those suffering with other chronic illnesses. Lastly there is increasing evidence through magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and biochemical markers that systemic, physiologic changes associated with COPD have direct effects on the brain’s vasculature that have also been associated with depression in the elderly, termed “late onset ” depression. The conclusion is that the presence of depression in a COPD patient does not reflect a single pathologic pathway. Rather the two disorders each contribute to the morbidity of the other. This review discusses the evidence supporting each of these contributors and suggests that an understanding of these varying elements can direct healthcare interventions...|$|E

40|$|A blowout {{consists}} of a sudden and uncontrolled release from a well of large amounts of high-pressure gas or gas-oil and carries with <b>it</b> <b>attendant</b> risks of explosion, fire, and pollution; loss of life, equipment and the hydrocarbon fuel itself are all possible. More generally, a blowout may be characterized as a low-probability, high-risk event which may occur when a complex technological process goes out of control. Drilling {{for oil and gas}} in the hazardous environment of the North Sea has, over the years, given rise to great efforts to improve safety standards and operating procedures. By the mid- 70 s many observers felt that blowouts in the area were extremely unlikely if not impossible. Nevertheless, 1977 saw two blowouts in the North Sea, one on the Ekofisk Bravo platform in the Norwegian sector and the other involving an exploratory well being drilled by the Maersk Explorer rig in the Danish sector. The blowouts caused great concern to the general public, to the governments involved, and within the oil industry, and prompted extensive reevaluations of equipment, procedures, and the general philosophy of accident prevention. The management or prevention of such incidents, whose causes lie at the man-technology interface, was the central theme of a Workshop at IIASA which brought together experts on the environment, representatives of the oil industry, and spokesmen for governments and their associated regulatory bodies. This volume is based on the proceedings of the Workshop and is divided into two main parts: the first is an overview of the blowout problem and the second contains the papers presented by the Workshop participants...|$|E

The aim of this article is to get to the roots of social-economic thoughts of the authors of New Deal. The conclusion is that for a long time before the Great Depression came there was strong tendency to strengthten state's power, especially concerning the federal institutions. Franklin D. Roosevelt thus went further the same direction as his progressive or conservative predecessors. progresivism, cooperative individualism, New Deal...|$|R

DAMES offers an overall {{view of the}} Netherlands' electricity supply and <b>it's</b> <b>attendant</b> emissions of CO 2, NOx and SO 2. It incorporates results from different sources: (1) monitoring reports on production and emissions from central power plants, (2) an electricity supply model for future years and (3) a database with actual and future emission factors. In DAMES, the electricity supply has been divided into contributions from: central production (electricity produced by companies producing electricity as core business), decentral production (electricity produced by companies producing electricity as by-product) and the import balance. Within these three 'subsectors', DAMES calculates production and emissions {{on the level of}} installation types. For combined heat and power production (CHP-installations), DAMES allocates a distinct fraction of the total emissions to the produced electricity. DAMES calculates aggregated emissions per kWh, an indicator that is often used in calculations on effectiveness measures. Furthermore, DAMES has an advantage over previous used instruments that it gives an integral overview of the effect of the fuel-mix, CHP, imports and the part of sustainable energy sources. DAMES has been applied on the years 1995 / 1998 and the future years 2010, 2020 and 2030. For the future years, prognoses have been used from two different scenarios of the CPB (Central Planning Bureau). These scenarios are called Global Competition and European Coordination...|$|R
