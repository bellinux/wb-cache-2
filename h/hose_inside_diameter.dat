40|$|The {{effects of}} {{suspension}} parameters and driving conditions on dynamic load-sharing of longitudinal-connected air suspensions of a tri-axle semi-trailer are investigated in this study. A novel nonlinear {{model of a}} multi-axle semi-trailer with longitudinal-connected air suspensions is formulated based on fluid mechanics and thermodynamics and validated through test results. The effects of road surface conditions, driving speeds, air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> and connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> on dynamic load-sharing capability of the semi-trailer were analyzed in terms of load-sharing criteria. Simulation results indicate that, when larger air lines and connectors are employed, the DLSC (Dynamic Load-Sharing Coefficient) optimization ratio reaches its peak value when the road roughness is medium. The optimization ratio fluctuates in a complex manner as driving speed increases. The results also indicate that if the air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> is always assumed to be larger than the connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter,</b> the influence of air line <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> on load-sharing is more significant {{than that of the}} connector <b>inside</b> <b>diameter.</b> The proposed approach can be used for further study of the influence of additional factors (such as vehicle load, static absolute air pressure and static height of air spring) on load-sharing and the control methods for multi-axle air suspensions with longitudinal air line...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical factors involved in the genesis of lower esophageal sphincter pressure. We determined the relationship between intraluminal pressure and <b>inside</b> <b>diameter,</b> estimated the ratio between the wall thickness to inside radius, and calculated the tension in the wall of the lower esophageal sphincter as a function of the <b>inside</b> <b>diameter.</b> Various degrees of circumferential stretch were applied by introducing probes of different diameters in the rat lower esophageal sphincter in vivo. The intraluminal pressure produced by the lower esophageal sphincter around each probe was measured and pressure-diameter curves were constructed during (a) resting state, (b) contraction produced by electrical stimulation, and (c) relaxation produced by esophageal distension. The intraluminal pressure at an <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 0. 5 mm was similar to that at <b>inside</b> <b>diameter</b> of 3. 2 mm. This was true for the sphincter at rest as well as upon electrical stimulation. The pressure diameter curve, however, was sigmoid in shape; at first it showed a decline and then an increase followed by decline in pressure again with increasing diameters. The ratio of wall thickness to inside radius or the magnification factor varied with <b>inside</b> <b>diameters</b> as expected and this ratio increased steeply at small <b>inside</b> <b>diameters.</b> The tension diameter curves of the sphincter muscle showed that optimal tension development occurred not near sphincter closure but at a much wider diameter of 3. 2 mm and that this muscle developed tension even at small luminal diameters. This behavior of the sphincter muscle ensures effective intraluminal pressure over a wide range of luminal diameters...|$|R
