5|$|The {{common earwig}} is an omnivore, eating plants and ripe fruit {{as well as}} {{actively}} hunting arthropods. To a large extent, this species is also a scavenger, feeding on decaying plant and animal matter if given the chance. Observed prey include largely plant lice, but also large insects such as bluebottle flies and woolly aphids. Plants that they feed on typically include clover, dahlias, zinnias, butterfly bush, <b>hollyhock,</b> lettuce, cauliflower, strawberry, blackberry, sunflowers, celery, peaches, plums, grapes, potatoes, roses, seedling beans and beets, and tender grass shoots and roots; they have also been known to eat corn silk, damaging the corn.|$|E

2500|$|Mme du Barry {{commissioned}} from Jean-Honoré Fragonard a {{suite of}} four large paintings for Louveciennes. The painter, who attached much importance to this commission, represented The Progress of Love. However, his masterpieces displeased the commissioner, {{the reason for the}} displeasure is still argued by art historians. [...] A 19th century reading claimed that the [...] "lovers" [...] in the series bore too close a resemblance to du Barry and the King. A later theory was that the paintings were in the Rococo style and du Barry's pavilion was decidedly Neo Classical, thus clashing terribly. [...] After du Barry refused the paintings, Fragonard stored them at his studio in the Louvre. [...] In 1790 Fragonard, his wife and son found themselves living with a cousin, Alexandre Maubert, in Grasse. As part of their room and board, Fragonard sold his cousin the four panels and painted two more large panels (Reverie and The Triumph of Love), four over-door images of cupids and two long <b>hollyhock</b> panels. [...] The works stayed in the family until the mid-1880s when they were sold to the industrialist J. P. Morgan. Since 1915, they {{have been one of the}} gems of the Frick Collection in New York.|$|E
