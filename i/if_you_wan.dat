40|$|E. V. Pitjeva, by {{processing}} {{more than}} 400, 000 planetary observations {{of various types}} with the dynamical models of the EPM 2006 ephemerides, recently estimated a correction to the canonical Newtonian-Einsteinian Venus' perihelion precession of - 0. 0004 +/- 0. 0001 arcseconds per century. The prediction of general relativity for the Lense-Thirring precession of the perihelion of Venus is - 0. 0003 arcseconds per century. It turns out that neither other mismodelld/unmodelled standard Newtonian/Einsteinian effects nor exotic ones, postulated to, e. g., explain the Pioneer anomaly, may have caused the determined extra-precession of the Venus orbit which, thus, can be reasonably attributed to the gravitomagnetic field of the Sun, not modelled in the routines of the EPM 2006 ephemerides. However, {{it must be noted}} that the quoted error is the formal, statistical one; the realistic uncertainty might be larger. Future improvements of the inner planets' ephemerides, with the inclusion of the Messenger and Venus-Express tracking data, should further improve the accuracy and the consistency of such a test of general relativity which would also benefit of the independent estimation of the extra-precessions of the perihelia (and the nodes) by other teams of astronomers.

These teachings are rather more conventional in tone and have differences in vocabulary and emphasis from the Memorial - which may reflect redaction by several hands. Nevertheless, the Instructions seem to reflect Angela’s teaching, albeit at some remove."No one can be saved without divine light. Divine light causes us to begin and to make progress, and it leads us to the summit of perfection. Therefore <b>if</b> <b>you</b> want to begin and to receive this divine light, pray. <b>If</b> <b>you</b> have begun to make progress, pray.
