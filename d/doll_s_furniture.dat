40|$|The U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> {{manufacturing}} industry {{has a long}} history and developed clusters in many states. It has also played an important part in the world furniture market over decades. In this context, this thesis attempts to provide a quantitative and qualitative analysis of the current situation and international competitiveness of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> industry for the period 2000 – 2009. The general aim of this thesis is to present the background information including the strong presence of major economic entities in the global furniture industry and to analyze the U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> industry based on the economic theories of inter-industry and intra-industry trade. ^ Data in this thesis was collected from secondary data sources. Collected data indicate that the global furniture industry had kept continuous growth through 2008, when it was impacted by the global financial crisis and started the downward trend. It also indicates that the U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> industry is in decline and losing global market. Indicators of U. S. 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>furniture</b> trade performance in terms of trade specialization index, export propensity, import penetration, and the ratio of exports to imports show that U. S. is a net-importer. This signifies a low degree of international trade competitiveness for U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. The results of Balassa 2 ̆ 7 s revealed comparative advantage index and Vollrath 2 ̆ 7 s revealed competitive advantage indexes suggest that, among the furniture producing countries, U. S. does not have a comparative or competitive advantage in furniture. The standard Grubel-Lloyd index is used to examine the extent of intra-industry trade of U. S. and major world-furniture trading countries. The index is also applied to U. S. 2 ̆ 7 s bilateral intra-industry trade in furniture with its major trading countries. The results indicate that the world furniture industry {{is more likely to be}} characterized by inter-industry trade, which is based on the significance of comparative advantage and factor endowments, rather than intra-industry trade. U. S. does not have a high level of intra-industry trade due to the fact that the values of U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> imports are very much higher than exports. The extent of bilateral intra-industry trade in <b>furniture</b> between U. <b>S.</b> and its major trading partners is also small except with Canada and Japan. ...|$|R

40|$|Furniture {{manufacturing}} {{has experienced}} rapid globalization in recent years. This is mainly {{the result of}} global production networks established by large manufacturers and retailers seeking to reduce costs in a highly competitive environment. The industry's globalization has been facilitated by technological innovations and the global reduction of trade and investment barriers. In the U. S., furniture-producing regions are experiencing tumultuous change. Growing numbers of firms are outsourcing production to China, which is now responsible for {{about half of all}} U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> imports. Employment levels have plummeted. However, an analysis of spatial patterns of employment, output, and capital investment in U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing shows that regional change is not uniform.

40|$|ABSTRACT. While {{much has}} been written {{regarding}} the declining global competitiveness of U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturing and the subsequent loss of domestic market share and jobs, less is known about the role of retailers in furniture importing. This study investigated the attitudes of U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> retailers toward China, Canada, and the United States as manufacturing sources for residential furniture and their perceptions of consumer interest in country of origin for furniture manufacturing. The study was based on a nationwide survey in 2005 of the membership of a large U. S. home furnishings trade association. Over half of the retailers surveyed indicated that they did not always know where the products they sold were made; but many consumers were asking about the country of origin of furniture products. The “halo effect ” associated with preference for home country described in previous country or origin studies was confirmed in this study, but in a situa-tion where the domestic source had already lost much of its market share. Low price was the only attribute for which China was rated higher than the U. S or Canada, reinforcing the “China price” phenomenon discussed in the literature. Adjusting for the halo revealed several opportunities for U. S. and Canadian firms to compete in the U. <b>S.</b> wood <b>furniture</b> market on non-price factors. Those retailers sourcing furniture from China were found to have more favorable perceptions of Chinese goods than those not sourcing from China; although both groups had equally favorable perceptions of the U. <b>S.</b> as a <b>furniture</b> source. Priorities for competitive strategies for manufacturers in each source country are noted based on the findings. doi: 10. 1300 /J 042 v 20 n 01 _ 0...|$|R

40|$|Furniture {{design for}} the {{increasing}} plus-size population emerges as a challenge for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> industry. Furniture manufacturers need to design and produce more products for this market. Design guidelines and methodology are needed for designing plus-size furniture that could potentially become products for mass production. ^ This study summarized plus-size furniture guidelines and generated a comprehensive furniture design methodology that integrates functional design, strength design, design for manufacturing. This furniture design methodology was validated by mean of {{a case study of}} plus-size furniture design, construction, and manufacturing. The case study yielded a plus-size rocking chair design with durable structure, sound functions, and low cost that was feasible to manufacture. The study explored the frameworks for plus-size furniture design and emphasized the functional design, strength design and design for manufacturing as parts of the methodology. It also involved discussing how strength design and design for manufacturing worked as design tools to optimize the design process, which could be meaningful for furniture design education. ...|$|R

In addition, we explored what strategies the U. <b>S.</b> domestic <b>furniture</b> manufacturers pursue to remain competitive. Kitchen cabinet manufacturers compete on the basis of customer service, price, and quality. Household furniture manufacturers compete on basis of quality, innovation, and customer service. Office furniture companies use costumer service, product performance, and price. ^ The third chapter describes a study of publicly-owned furniture companies with records in the Standards 2 ̆ 6 Poor 2 ̆ 7 s database around the world. The objective was to find key financial factors for companies in this industry based on data from 1997 to 2002. Results show that liquidity, operation performance, and capital turnover are the key financial performance factors. European and American furniture companies performed better than Asian companies in terms of capital turnover. The kitchen cabinet sector was identified as the highest performer over household and office furniture companies in terms of liquidity over the last two years. ^ Chapters four and five are the results of a benchmarking study conducted in six U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> manufacturers. Two of the six participating companies were awarded the Shingo Prize for Excellence in Manufacturing in 2003.

40|$|Graduation date: 2005 Innovation is {{considered}} the ultimate drive for business success. Fast growing furniture imports from China have become a controversial topic within U. <b>S.</b> wood and <b>furniture</b> industries. Low-cost production, which is stereotypically considered as the major competitive advantage of the Chinese-made products, has received considerable attention by {{a large body of}} research, while the Chinese furniture industry's innovative side is less studied. This study profiles the industry's recent development and measures its innovativeness via a combination of qualitative and quantitative approaches. Management-level interviews were conducted with 18 Chinese companies recommended as innovative by industry experts. A conceptual innovation model developed using qualitative analysis of interviews was tested by a quantitative survey. Key findings suggest that Chinese furniture companies are pursuing innovation with three equal focuses on product, process and business systems. In the future, the industry will likely become more innovative in all three aspects, with major focuses on product and process. Company innovativeness was significantly correlated with company competitiveness. Improving sales performance and minimizing costs provide motivations for Chinese companies to adopt innovation. No relationship was found between profitability and innovativeness. This suggests that the industry's traditional focus on low-cost-low-profit production still has significant influence on industry innovation activities. Company innovativeness and competitiveness also varied with company size and export orientation. Forming strategic alliances with large Chinese manufacturers with moderate export orientation is suggested for U. <b>S.</b> <b>furniture</b> companies wishing to enter into the Chinese market...|$|R

When a child understands how furniture is assembled and is encouraged to be creative in play, he or she gains valuable learning experiences while having fun. Together, a child and adult can easily assemble all the pieces of furniture without any need for tools. Much like a puzzle, the child has fun assembling the furniture while, at the same time, learns valuable lessons of spatial relationships and structural stability. This also leads to an understanding of safety in play. The added element of a portable three-inch LED orb encourages interaction once all pieces are assembled. Abstract design elements were used to stimulate imagination during play. Using basic Gestalt design principles, the furniture series was constructed to not only be structural but to be beautiful in design.
