25|$|Some part of {{the feed}} water from the {{low-pressure}} zone is transferred to the high-pressure <b>economizer</b> by a booster pump. This <b>economizer</b> heats up the water to its saturation temperature. This saturated water goes through the high-temperature zone of the boiler and is supplied to the high-pressure turbine.|$|E
25|$|The water {{enters the}} boiler through a {{section in the}} {{convection}} pass called the <b>economizer.</b> From the <b>economizer</b> it passes to the steam drum and from there it goes through downcomers to inlet headers {{at the bottom of}} the water walls. From these headers the water rises through the water walls of the furnace where some of it is turned into steam and the mixture of water and steam then re-enters the steam drum. This process may be driven purely by natural circulation (because the water is the downcomers is denser than the water/steam mixture in the water walls) or assisted by pumps. In the steam drum, the water is returned to the downcomers and the steam is passed through a series of steam separators and dryers that remove water droplets from the steam. The dry steam then flows into the superheater coils.|$|E
25|$|Feed {{water comes}} {{in through the}} <b>economizer</b> and then exits after having {{attained}} saturation temp in the water or steam circuit. Finally it then flows through evaporator and super heater. If {{the temperature of the}} gases entering the heat recovery boiler is higher, then the temperature of the exiting gases is also high.|$|E
40|$|With {{the recent}} {{development}} of the IT technology, the demand for data centers has significantly increased, and modular data centers have attracted considerable attention because of their excellent stability, scalability, and economic feasibility. This research quantitatively analyzed the applicability of various air-side <b>economizers</b> and their energy-saving potential in modular data centers. A detailed cooling load estimation process was established for modular data centers, and annual cooling energy simulations were carried out using various air-side <b>economizers.</b> The various air-side <b>economizers</b> yielded cooling coil load savings of 76 - 99 % in comparison to conventional cooling systems in data centers, and the total cooling energy savings of the <b>economizers</b> ranged from 47. 5 % to 67. 2 %. Indirect air-side <b>economizers</b> with high-effectiveness heat exchangers were found to yield significant energy saving (63. 6 %) and have simple system configurations. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

25|$|In 1933 Byrd was {{appointed}} to fill a vacancy in the United States Senate; he won reelection as a Democrat in 1933, 1934, 1940, 1946, 1952, 1958, and 1964. Byrd and his colleague Carter Glass invoked senatorial courtesy to stop Roosevelt's nomination of Floyd H. Roberts to a federal judgeship in Virginia in 1939. Byrd broke with Roosevelt and became an opponent of the New Deal, but he was an internationalist and strongly supported Roosevelt's foreign policy. As war loomed in 1941 Congress approved his proposal for a joint House-Senate committee to look into ways of eliminating nonessential expenditures. By late September, the Joint Committee on Reduction of Non-essential Federal Expenditures was in operation with Senator Byrd as Chairman; it built his national reputation as an <b>economizer.</b>|$|E
2500|$|A {{thermal power}} station such as Tracy {{converts}} the energy contained in heavy fuel oil into heat, motion, and then into electrical energy. Burning fuel vaporize water and the steam expands to drive a turbine that spins the rotor of an alternator to generate electricity. Condensing water is then reused for another cycle.

50|$|A common {{application}} of <b>economizers</b> in steam power plants is {{to capture the}} waste heat from boiler stack gases (flue gas) and transfer it to the boiler feedwater. This raises {{the temperature of the}} boiler feedwater, lowering the needed energy input, in turn reducing the firing rates needed for the rated boiler output. <b>Economizers</b> lower stack temperatures which may cause condensation of acidic combustion gases and serious equipment corrosion damage if care is not taken in their design and material selection.|$|R
50|$|In boilers, <b>economizers</b> are heat {{exchange}} devices that heat fluids, usually water, up to but not normally beyond {{the boiling point}} of that fluid. <b>Economizers</b> are so named because they can {{make use of the}} enthalpy in fluid streams that are hot, but not hot enough to be used in a boiler, thereby recovering more useful enthalpy and improving the boiler's efficiency. They are a device fitted to a boiler which saves energy by using the exhaust gases from the boiler to preheat the cold water used to fill it (the feed water).|$|R
40|$|Outdoor air <b>economizers</b> (OAE) {{control the}} amount of air drawn into a {{building}} {{in order to reduce}} energy usage and improve indoor air quality. Air-side <b>economizers</b> are required by energy standards such as ASHRAE Standard 90. 1 in many commercial applications because of their energy savings’ potential. However, many <b>economizers</b> do not operate as designed because of damper, sensor, and other faults which can actually lead to greater energy use. Fault detection and diagnostics (FDD) tools have been developed to identify faults when they occur, however, no general methodology for assessing these tools has yet to be proposed. This paper presents and applies a general OAE FDD assessment method. FDD tools described by Seem and House (2009), Schein et al. (2003), and Brambley et al. (1998) are analyzed with respect to various OAE faults. Additionally, these FDD methods are assessed with the method using simulated and experimental data with both single and multiple simultaneous faults...|$|R
2500|$|The modern {{recovery}} boiler is {{of a single}} drum design, with vertical steam generating bank and wide spaced superheaters. This design was first proposed by Colin MacCallum in 1973 in a proposal by Götaverken (now Metso Power inc.) for a large {{recovery boiler}} having a capacity of 4,000,000lb of black liquor solids per day for a boiler in Skutskär, Sweden, but this design was rejected as being too advanced at that time by the prospective owner. [...] MacCallum presented the design at BLRBAC and in a paper [...] "The Radiant Recovery Boiler" [...] printed in Tappi magazine in December 1980. [...] The first boiler of this single-drum design was sold by Götaverken at Leaf River in Mississippi in 1984. [...] The construction of the vertical steam generating bank {{is similar to the}} vertical <b>economizer.</b> Vertical boiler bank is easy to keep clean. The spacing between superheater panels increased and leveled off at over 300 but under 400mm. Wide spacing in superheaters helps to minimize fouling. This arrangement, in combination with sweetwater attemperators, ensures maximum protection against corrosion. There have been numerous improvements in recovery boiler materials to limit corrosion.|$|E

For four scenarios that modify ventilation rates, we estimated changes in sick building syndrome (SBS) symptoms, work performance, short-term absence, and building energy consumption. The estimated annual economic benefits were $ 13 billion from increasing minimum ventilation rates (VRs) from 8 to 10 L/s per person, $ 38 billion from increasing minimum VRs from 8 to 15 L/s per person, and $ 33 billion from increasing VRs by adding outdoor air <b>economizers</b> for the 50 % of the office floor area that currently lacks <b>economizers.</b> The estimated $ 0. 04 billion in annual energy-related benefits of decreasing minimum VRs from 8 to 6. 5 L/s per person are very small compared to the projected annual costs of $ 12 billion.

40|$|Extending the {{environmental}} operating parameters of a data center {{is one of}} the industry-accepted procedures for reducing overall energy consumption. Relaxing traditionally tight control over temperature and humidity should result in less power required to cool the data center. However, until recently, the impact of increased data center operating temperature on the information technology (IT) equipment installed in the data center has not been well understood. Historically, it has been widely presumed to be detrimental to the equipment’s reliability and service availability. Interest in the use of economization methods to cool data centers is helping to drive increased focus on extending the data center operating range to maximize the potential benefits of air-side and water-side <b>economizers</b> in general. With <b>economizers,</b> the greater the number of hours and days a year that they can be used, the less the mechanical chiller based cooling component of the infrastructure needs to operate. More importantly in some cases were <b>economizers</b> can be used, the benefits could be significant enough to reduce the mechanical cooling capacity or even eliminate it altogether.

50|$|The first {{successful}} <b>economizer</b> design {{was used to}} increase the steam-raising efficiency of the boilers of stationary steam engines. It was patented by Edward Green in 1845, and since then has been known as Green's <b>economizer.</b> It consisted of an array of vertical cast iron tubes connected to a tank of water above and below, between which the boiler's exhaust gases passed. This is the reverse arrangement to that usually but not always seen in the fire tubes of a boiler; there the hot gases usually pass through tubes immersed in water, whereas in an <b>economizer</b> the water passes through tubes surrounded by hot gases. While both are heat exchange devices, in a boiler the burning gases heat the water to produce steam to drive an engine, whether piston or turbine, whereas in an <b>economizer,</b> some of the heat energy that would otherwise all be lost to the atmosphere is instead used to heat the water and/or air that will go into the boiler, thus saving fuel.
