As a follow-up to her funeral, her remains and personal items were put on one-day public display at <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> on 26 February 2006. The relics (Sariras) displayed were crystalline or pearl-like deposits found in Venerable Ho's ashes. Buddhists believe these are usually found in cremated Buddhist masters, are holy, and treat them with reverence.|$|E

25|$|As for the {{etymology}} Cicero {{gives the}} verb monēre warn, hence the Warner. Palmer accepts Cicero's etymology {{as a possibility}} while adding mons mount, hill, verb e-mineo and noun monile referred to the Capitol, place of her cult. Also perhaps a cultic term or even, as in <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> were kept the Libri Lintei, monere would thence have the meaning of recording: Livius Andronicus identifies her as Mnemosyne.|$|E
25|$|In {{the later}} {{writings}} of the Roman poet Ovid, Athena {{was said to have}} competed against the mortal Arachne in a weaving competition, afterwards transforming Arachne into the first spider; Ovid also describes how she transformed Medusa into a Gorgon after witnessing her being raped by Poseidon in <b>her</b> <b>temple.</b> Since the Renaissance, Athena has become an international symbol of wisdom and the arts. Western artists and allegorists have often used Athena as a symbol of freedom and democracy.|$|E
25|$|A legend {{links the}} temple to Gundicha, {{the queen of}} Indradyumna (the legendary builder of the main temple) - after whom the Gundicha Temple is named. Gundicha had a peep at the divine image of Jagannath being created by the {{celestial}} architect Vishwakarma. Impressed by the image, she insisted on her husband building the temple for the deity and starting the Ratha Yatra. Another variant suggests that Jagannath was pleased with <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> and promised to visit her house, now the Gundicha Temple.|$|E

25|$|All festivals of Juno {{were held}} on the kalendae of a month except two (or, perhaps, three): The Nonae Caprotinae on the nonae of July, the festival of Juno Capitolina on September 13, because {{the date of the}}se two was {{determined}} by preeminence of Jupiter. Perhaps a second festival of Juno Moneta was held on October 10, possibly the date of the dedication of <b>her</b> <b>temple.</b> This fact reflects the strict association of the goddess with the beginning of each lunar month.|$|E
25|$|The Gorgoneion {{appears to}} have {{originated}} as an apotropaic symbol intended to ward off evil. In a late myth invented to explain {{the origins of the}} Gorgon, Medusa is described as having been a young priestess who served in the temple of Athena in Athens. Poseidon lusted after Medusa, and raped her in the temple of Athena, refusing to allow her vow of chastity to stand in his way. Upon discovering the desecration of <b>her</b> <b>temple,</b> Athena transformed Medusa into a hideous monster with serpents for hair whose gaze would turn any mortal to stone.|$|E
25|$|But in Matthew Arnold’s {{dramatic}} poem “The Strayed Reveller” (1849), {{in which}} Circe {{is one of}} the characters, the power of her potion is differently interpreted. The inner tendencies unlocked by it are not the choice between animal nature and reason but between two types of impersonality, between divine clarity and the poet’s participatory and tragic vision of life. In the poem, Circe discovers a youth laid asleep in the portico of <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> by a draught of her ivy-wreathed bowl. On awaking from possession by the poetic frenzy it has induced, he craves for it to be continued.|$|E

25|$|Anahit {{was also}} venerated at Artashat (Artaxata), {{the capital of}} the Armenian Kingdom, where <b>her</b> <b>temple</b> was close to that of Tiur, the divinity of oracles. At Astishat, center of the cult of Vahagn, she was revered as voskimayr, the 'golden mother'. In 69 BCE, the {{soldiers}} of Lucullus saw cows consecrated to 'Persian Artemis' roaming freely at Tomisa in Sophene (on the Euphrates in South-West Armenia), where the animals bore the brand of a torch on their heads. Following Tiridates' conversion to Christianity, the cult of Anahit was condemned and iconic representations of the divinity were destroyed.|$|E
25|$|Around 33% of the Taiwanese {{population}} are Taoist, {{making it the}} second largest religion of Taiwan. Most {{people who believe in}} Taoism also ascribe to Buddhism at the same time, as the differences and boundaries between the two religions are not always clear. Many residents of the area also worship the folk sea goddess Mazu, who is variously syncretized as a Taoist immortal or avatar of the bodhisattva Guanyin. <b>Her</b> <b>temple</b> on Cijin Island is the oldest in the city, with its original bamboo-and-thatch structure first opened in 1673. The area surrounding it formed the center of the city's early settlement.|$|E
25|$|Augustus' {{religious}} reformations {{raised the}} funding and public {{profile of the}} Vestals. They were given high-status seating at games and theatres. The emperor Claudius appointed them as priestesses to {{the cult of the}} deified Livia, wife of Augustus. They seem to have retained their religious and social distinctions well into the 4th century, after political power within the Empire had shifted to the Christians. When the Christian emperor Gratian refused the office of pontifex maximus, he took steps toward the dissolution of the order. His successor Theodosius I extinguished Vesta's sacred fire and vacated <b>her</b> <b>temple.</b>|$|E

25|$|A {{festival of}} Venus Genetrix (September 26) was held under state auspices from 46 BC at <b>her</b> <b>Temple</b> in the Forum of Caesar, in {{fulfillment}} of a vow by Julius Caesar, who claimed her personal favour as his divine patron, and ancestral goddess of the Julian clan. Caesar dedicated the temple during his unprecedented and extraordinarily lavish quadruple triumph. At the same time, he was pontifex maximus and Rome's senior magistrate; {{the festival is}} thought to mark the unprecedented promotion of a personal, family cult {{to one of the}} Roman state. Caesar's heir, Augustus, made much of these personal and family associations with Venus as an Imperial deity. The festival's rites are not known.|$|E

25|$|Froon's camera {{contained}} {{photos from}} April 1 {{suggesting that the}} women had taken a trail at the overlook of the Continental Divide and wandered into some wilderness hours before their first attempt to reach 911, but with no signs of anything unusual. On April 8, ninety flash photos were taken between 01:00 am and 04:00 am, apparently deep in the jungle and in near-complete darkness. A few photos show that they were possibly near a river or a ravine. Some show a twig with plastic bags and candy wrappers {{on top of a}} rock, another shows what looks like toilet paper and a mirror on another rock, and another shows the back of Kremers's head with what looks like blood by <b>her</b> <b>temple.</b>|$|E
