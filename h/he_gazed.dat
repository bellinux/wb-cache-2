5|$|Martin Luther King Jr. was the {{conscience}} of his generation. <b>He</b> <b>gazed</b> upon {{the great wall of}} segregation and saw that the power of love could bring it down. From the pain and exhaustion of his fight to fulfill the promises of our founding fathers for our humblest citizens, he wrung his eloquent statement of his dream for America. He made our nation stronger because he made it better. His dream sustains us yet.|$|E

500|$|Sergeant Boston Corbett {{crept up}} behind the barn and shot Booth in [...] "the {{back of the head}} about an inch below the spot where his [...] shot had entered the head of Mr. Lincoln", {{severing}} his spinal cord. Booth was carried out onto the steps of the barn. A soldier poured water into his mouth, which he spat out, unable to swallow. Booth told the soldier, [...] "Tell my mother I die for my country." [...] Unable to move his limbs, he asked a soldier to lift his hands before his face and whispered his last words as <b>he</b> <b>gazed</b> at them: [...] "Useless... useless." [...] He died on the porch of the Garrett farm two hours later. Corbett was initially arrested for disobeying orders, but was later released and was largely considered a hero by the media and the public.|$|E

500|$|Smith {{never said}} how he {{produced}} the Book of Mormon, saying {{only that he}} translated {{by the power of}} God and implying that he had transcribed the words. The Book of Mormon itself states only that its text will [...] "come forth by the gift and power of God unto the interpretation thereof". As such, considerable disagreement about the actual method used exists. For {{at least some of the}} earliest dictation, Smith is said to have used the [...] "Urim and Thummim", a pair of seer stones he said were buried with the plates. Later, however, he is said to have used a chocolate-colored stone he had found in 1822 that he had used previously for treasure hunting. Joseph Knight said that Smith saw the words of the translation while <b>he</b> <b>gazed</b> at the stone or stones in the bottom of his hat, excluding all light, a process similar to divining the location of treasure. Sometimes, Smith concealed the process by raising a curtain or dictating from another room, while at other times he dictated in full view of witnesses while the plates lay covered on the table. [...] After completing the translation, Smith gave the brown stone to Cowdery, but continued to receive revelations using another stone until about 1833 when he said he no longer needed it.|$|E
500|$|With the {{relative}} liberalization during the 1960s, which followed {{the rise of}} Nicolae Ceaușescu as communist leader, Caragiale's work enjoyed a more favorable reception. At that stage, nationalism and national communism became standards of official discourse, and intellectuals such as Edgar Papu were allowed to reinterpret Romanian culture {{on the basis of}} nationalist tenets: Papu's controversial theory, known as [...] "Protochronism", claimed that Romanians as a group were at the source of any innovative movement in world culture. Papu thus believed that Caragiale, whom he described as superior to Flaubert, had foreshadowed Lampedusa's writing techniques. Independent of this approach, Mateiu Caragiale was being rediscovered by new generations of writers. In 1966, Viața Românească published Radu Albala's În deal, pe Militari ("On the Hill, in Militari"), which was a sequel and final chapter of Sub pecetea tainei. Albala was significantly influenced by Caragiale throughout his work, as was his contemporary Alexandru George in his series of fiction writings. Other such authors are Fănuș Neagu, who was inspired by Craii... to write his 1976 book The Handsome Lunatics of the Big Cities, and Virgiliu Stoenescu, whose poetry, according to Barbu Cioculescu, was influenced by [...] "the charm of word appositions" [...] in Caragiale's poems. Caragiale's name was also cited by the writer Geo Bogza, who, in his youth, was a major figure of the Romanian avant-garde movement. In one of his late prose pieces, titled Ogarii, [...] "The Borzois", Bogza, who praised the dog breed for its innate grace, wrote: [...] "I do not know if Mateiu Caragiale, who thought himself so uncommon, ever owned borzois. But, if he did, I'm sure <b>he</b> <b>gazed</b> on them with melancholy and with secret envy." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{apparition}} {{is said to}} {{have occurred}} {{at the height of the}} Franco-Prussian War. Pontmain, a hamlet of about 500 inhabitants, lay between the oncoming Prussian army and the city of Laval. [...] The Barbedette family consisted of father César, his wife, Victoire, with their two sons Joseph and Eugène, aged ten and twelve, and another older boy who was away in the army. On the evening of 17 January 1871, the two boys were helping their father in the barn when the elder, Eugène, walked over towards the door to look out. As <b>he</b> <b>gazed</b> at the star studded sky he suddenly he saw an apparition of a beautiful woman smiling at him; she was wearing a blue gown covered with golden stars, and a black veil under a golden crown.|$|E

2500|$|William Brockedon, {{who came}} to the region in 1825, {{considered}} the crossing of the Theodul Pass from Breuil to Zermatt a difficult undertaking. He gave, however, expression to his enthusiasm on the summit. When he arrived exhausted {{on the top of the}} pass, <b>he</b> <b>gazed</b> [...] "on the beautiful pyramid of the Cervin, more wonderful than aught else in sight, rising from its bed of ice to a height of 5,000 feet, a spectacle of indescribable grandeur." [...] In this [...] "immense natural amphitheatre, enclosed from time immemorial by snow-clad mountains and glaciers ever white, in the presence of these grand walls the mind is overwhelmed, not indeed that it is unable to contemplate the scene, but it staggers under the immensity of those objects which it contemplates." ...|$|E
2500|$|Washington {{then gave}} a short but impassioned speech, {{now known as}} the , {{counseling}} patience. [...] His message was that they should oppose anyone [...] "who wickedly attempts to open the floodgates of civil discord and deluge our rising empire in blood." [...] He then produced a letter from a member of Congress to read to the officers. [...] <b>He</b> <b>gazed</b> upon it and fumbled with it without speaking. He then took a pair of reading glasses from his pocket, which were new; few of the men had seen him wear them. He then said: [...] "Gentlemen, you will permit me to put on my spectacles, for I have not only grown gray but almost blind in the service of my country." [...] This caused the men to realize that Washington had sacrificed a great deal for the Revolution, just as much as any of them. These, of course, were his fellow officers, most having worked closely with him for several years. [...] Many of those present were moved to tears, and with this act, the conspiracy collapsed as he read the letter. [...] He then left the room, and General Knox and others offered resolutions reaffirming their loyalty. [...] Knox and Colonel Brooks were then appointed to a committee to draft a suitable resolution. [...] Approved by virtually the entire assembly, the resolution expressed [...] "unshaken confidence" [...] in Congress, and [...] "disdain" [...] and [...] "abhorrence" [...] for the irregular proposals published earlier in the week. Historian Richard Kohn believes the entire meeting was carefully stage-managed by Washington, Knox, and their supporters. [...] The only voice raised in opposition was that of Colonel Timothy Pickering, who criticized members of the assembly for hypocritically condemning the anonymous addresses that only days before they had been praising.|$|E
