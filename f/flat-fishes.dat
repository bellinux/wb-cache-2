5000|$|Many of {{the representatives}} of science and {{commerce}} present had different views to Huxley. Their views were put forward by E. Ray Lankester, who summed up the scientific contributions in an essay on what we would now call ecology. He pointed out that [...] "it {{is a mistake to}} suppose that the place of fish removed from a particular fishing ground is immediately taken by some of the grand total of fish, which are so numerous in comparison with man's depredations as to make his operations in this respect insignificant...there is on the contrary evidence that shoal fish, like herrings, mackerel and pilchard (Sardina pilchardus), and ground-fish, such as soles and other <b>flat-fishes,</b> are really localised. If man removes a large proportion of these fish from the areas which they inhabit, the natural balance is upset and chiefly in so far as the production of young fish is concerned." [...] During this masterly address he went on to develop this theme and concluded with an appeal for the formation of a society to foster the study of marine life, both for its scientific interest and because of the need {{to know more about the}} life histories and habitats of food fishes. Professor Lankester envisaged that such a society would construct a laboratory close to the coast, with the building containing aquaria and apparatus for the circulation of seawater and, most importantly, laboratory accommodation for scientists. The appeal was answered by a group of eminent scientists, who resolved to form a society and build a laboratory on the British coast.|$|E
40|$|Much of the {{interest}} in dynamics in the Bering Sea, {{now and in the}} past, has been spurred by concerns over the stability and sustainability of its vast living resources. Particularly prominent today are depressed popula-tions of several species of marine mammals, notably great whales, Steller sea lions, fur seals, harbor seals, and sea otters, and of additional species of considerable economic importance, such as king crabs, shrimp, and Pacific Ocean perch. The reason for the collapse of whales, shrimp, and Pacific Ocean perch is known—they were killed by commercial fisheries. The recent decline of sea otters in the Aleutian Islands is thought to have been caused by increased predation. The reasons for diminished popula-tions of other species are not known, or at least not agreed upon, and have been the stuff of extensive, often rancorous debate. No less dramatic, however, have been spectacular increases of certain fishes, such as <b>flat-fishes,</b> walleye pollock that grew in abundance by nearly an order of mag-nitude between the 1960 s and 1980 s, and Pacific salmon that provide...|$|E
40|$|During {{the last}} 10 {{years we have}} been experimenting in the {{laboratory}} at the Flødevigen Sea-Fish Hatchery with the rearing of several species of salt-water fishes. The intention has been to bring about better methods for experimental purposes and to get some information as to what factors may be of importance {{for the survival of}} the eggs and larvae in nature. In this paper we are dealing with herring, cod, and plaice, especially the results from the two last seasons. In order to attain success when rearing fish-larvae, especially those species having an air-bladder, it is important to control the gas content of the sea-water. It is essential that when larvae are reared in small aquaria at a pressure of but one atmosphere the gas content of the seawater must be kept relatively low. It is assumed that the gas pressure and not the content of gas is the chief factor. Larvae living in the sea at a water pressure of e. g. 10 metres will probably sustain a gas content in the sea-water which will be detrimental near the surface. In this connection it is worth mentioning that the young cod-larvae react at once to changes in water pressure. When the water pressure is about 5 metres the larvae in a closed aquarium will keep to the surface. When the water pressure is shut off the larvae will straightaway sink apathetic to the bottom, but swim up again when the water pressure once more is put on. Experiments indicate that cod-larvae with a big air-bladder may recover when they are transferred to an aquarium covered with silk net and lowered to a depth of 5 to 10 metres. The eggs of the pelagic spring spawners are not affected by reasonable variations in the gas content. If the gas content is not reduced in the aquaria the larvae will get gas-bubbles in the intestines. This does not occur till the yolk-sack is resorbed - and the intestines and gills are functioning. It is assumed that the gas is liberated when the sea-water passes the gills. Small gasbubbles are formed inside and swallowed. In the case of herring the gas-bubbles are fatal. In the plaice the gas-bubbles will pass through the anus - and are not likely to harm the young. In the case of the cod we have not observed the gas to be within the intestines. In early stages - about a week after the resorbtion of the yolk-sack - the gas occurs free in the cavity. The intestines may be ruptured-or the gas may originate from the early air-bladder. In older stages the air-bladder will expand, the young will turn belly upwards and die, or the air-bladder may be ruptured. In older stages of the plaice - up to a length of some centimetres at least - fine gasbubbles rnay accumulate in the veins, and the fish will succumb. In the laboratory the gas content may be reduced by filtering the sea-water slowly through fine sand. Great quantities of gas will accumulate in the sand. The composition of this gas O²/N² is somewhat the same as in the atmosphere, the content of oxygen being slightly higher. Some of the gas in the sea-water in the laboratory may originate from the atmosphere - by leakage in the pump bearings. Studies of the gas of the air-bladder of cod (by Miss Eva Henly) indicate that oxygen is the operative factor. The results of the rearing experiments have improved to a very high degree after the gas problem was taken into consideration. The larvae of herring, cod, and plaice (and other <b>flat-fishes)</b> will thrive for weeks in the small aquaria used, containing but 35 litres. The <b>flat-fishes</b> are ordinarily reared without any mortality to the bottom stage in numbers from 1 to 3 thousands in the same aquarium. In this way the critical period - the moment when feeding begins - has been overcome. Experiments have shown that the cod-larvae may live in filtered water - without food - for several days after the yolk-sack is resorbed, and still thrive when fed. If we want to rear the fish further we encounter other problems. Will the feeding with the nauplii of Artemia be sufficient in the long run? Do they contain enough vitamins? Experiments have been made to feed the nauplii with flagellate cultures for some days before giving them to the young fish. Those experiments are to be continued. Experiments to furnish the young herring, about 2 months of age, with freshly caught plankton were negative. The herring did not take the copepods or Daphnia, and the plankton introduced seemed to kill the Artemia. We are now using fine chopped Mytilus edulis - even for the herring. The volume must be augmented - larger aquaria, more water, and larger filters. Experiments to rear cod and plaice in our large rearing boxes for lobster using but slightly filtered water were entirely negative. The results were the same when transferring several species of flatfishes after they had passed the stage of transformation. At present we have a good sample of herring 6 months of age, plaice ½ & 1 ½ year, and soles 5 years of age - all brought up from eggs in the laboratory. The last season we had some mortality of the young when 2 - 3 months of age. The symptoms in the plaice indicated an attack of Vibrio anguillarum. In the herring the symptoms indicated Lentospora cerebralis. The cod died before we were aware of the cause of the mortality and could take steps to reduce it. The attack on the plaice was stopped by adding some dissolved salt to the sea-water used. The herring reared in a larger aquarium in the laboratory survived, but in an ordinary aquarium (35 l) they succumbed. The infection this year came probably from our water reservoir. This was partly emptied in early winter, the algae and animals living along the walls died - and {{we were not able to}} have it cleaned out because of high snow and frost. Several experiments indicate that the young cod especially is very sensitive to products of metabolism. In one instance the water was drawn from a container where few cod of 1 - 2 years of age were living. The fry died. But when the older fish were removed, and the container cleaned a new batch thrived. It is impossible to say wether the mortality in the first experiment is to be ascribed to the chemical effect of the products of metabolism or to bacteria. Our experiences from last season give a warning that bacteria and products of metabolism may be a problem of higher order. Our earlier investigations in the inner Oslo-fjord, highly contaminated by sewage, have shown that the survival of the eggs and larvae of the spring spawners here is very poor. And in some places, where contaminated water occurs, even the grown up cod may suffer a great mortality, evidently caused by Vibrio anguillarum. The problem of rearing for experimental purposes has been our main object. Experiments on a large-scale rearing have to be postponed till we have aquired a relatively full knowledge as to the factors of main importance. Besides this work we have made some observations on the behaviour of the eggs. Many of the observations have to be confirmed by special experiments. In order to bring those points under consideration we will, however, mention some of them. The hatching and rearing has ordinarily been undertaken at an ordinary temperature of the sea-water during the season. In some experiments the water has been cooled or heated artificially. As we have no thermostats available for that purposes it has not been possible to keep the temperature quite constant. At a temperature of approximately 2 ° C the cod-eggs hatch normally. herring-eggs will also hatch at that temperature, but the larvae will have difficulties in escaping the eggs, and a heavy mortality occurs. Temperature-variations between 2 ° and 10 ° give high mortality to cod-eggs. In some rearing experiments the mortality among the young may be somewhat higher when the temperature is raising. The question of the relative gas content here comes into the problem. Fungus may be detrimental to the eggs. If they are heavily attacked, the eggs will sink. This occurs especially in foggy weather, and when the water has a relatively low salinity. The attack may be reduced by transferring the eggs for half an hour to sea-water to which has been added some salt. In some cases the cod-eggs have been infected by a flagellate living close inside the shell. Both these pests have been observed in nature - the last mentioned even in the middle of Skagerak. Cod-eggs hatched in circulating - but not renewed - water (constant salinity), gave a poor result. Bacteria may here be involved - or the products of metabolism. The influence of light has been studied more fully. The experiences from the hatching boxes indicate that the hatching of the cod-eggs gives the best results near the window. It is, however, difficult to say anything conclusive of the influence of the light in this case. In the boxes with less light there will also be a higher growth of fungus. Experiments with plaice-eggs indicate that normal daylight near a window - but shadowed for direct sun - gave poor results. And in experiments in the open air the eggs have died. On the other hand the plaice-eggs will hatch well in total darkness. It appears, however, that the plaice-eggs hatched in total darkness will give a higher percentage of larvae with abnormal pigmentation. The dorsal side is quite white, only the fins are pigmentated. When those plaice in the bottom stage, or later, are transferred to our salt-water pond under normal daylight and normal food for several months, no alteration takes place. Experiments also indicate that the plaice-eggs react with light. They may sink in the middle of the day and come to the surface again during the night...|$|E

40|$|Gelatin from skins {{of several}} marine species were {{compared}} {{on the basis}} of their rheological characteristics (viscoelasticity and gel strength) and chemical/structural properties (amino acid composition, molecular weight distribution and triple helix formation). Gelatins from <b>flat-fish</b> species (sole and megrim) presented the best gelling ability and the gels were more thermostable than those from cold-adapted fish (cod and hake). This different behaviour may be explained considering the amino acid composition, the α 1 /α 2 collagen-chain ratio, and the molecular weight distribution. Thus, cod gelatin presented a lower alanine and imino acid content, and a decreased proline hydroxylation degree; cod and hake gelatins presented a low α 1 /α 2 ratio (∼ 1); hake gelatin showed a highly significant decrease in β-components and other aggregates. The squid gelatin presented the most significant changes regarding amino acid composition and molecular weight distribution, most of these differences arising from the low solubility of the squid connective tissue. However, the squid gelatin showed viscoelastic properties intermediate between those from <b>flat-fish</b> and cold-adapted fish species. Circular dichroism analysis reveals that gelling involves a refolding of denatured collagen chains into the typical triple helix conformation and, conversely, unfolding upon reheating. Thermal folding and unfolding curves were similar to those of viscoelastic properties but showing a shift towards lower or higher temperatures upon cooling and heating, respectively. The folding process seem to be directly related in the stabilisation of the gels without disregarding its role in triggering the gelation process. Finally, gel strength evaluation revealed the importance of slow cold maturation. © 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved. Peer Reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — An adaptive, {{non-linear}} {{control strategy}} for underactuated Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) is proposed in this paper. In {{order to improve}} the autonomy of AUVs, {{it is important to}} develop intelligent control systems which can reduce the effects of coupled and non-linear characteristics of the vehicles. As most of the AUVs are under actuated systems, classical control scheme fails due to the non-integrable acceleration constraints on the vehicle. A dynamic state feedback law is proposed here to overcome this and to reduce the modelling errors arising out of various assumptions on the vehicle dynamics. In addition, proposed method can work satisfactorily under commonly encountered uncertainties such as ocean current and parameter variations. The system states are stabilized by forcing the tracking errors to an arbitrarily small neighborhood of zero by using backstepping technique and the tracking error dynamics. The proposed strategy has been tested through simulations, for a <b>flat-fish</b> type AUV. A comparison of the results for conventional method and the proposed method is also presented.

60|$|Still, by {{hook and}} by crook (especially the former), by {{observation}} here and experiment there, naturalists {{in the end}} have managed to piece together a considerable mass of curious and interesting information of an out-of-the-way sort about the domestic habits and manners of sundry piscine races. And, indeed, the morals of fish are far more varied and divergent than the uniform nature of the world they inhabit might lead an à priori philosopher to imagine. To {{the eye of the}} mere casual observer every fish would seem at first sight to be a mere fish, and to differ but little in sentiments and ethical culture from all the rest of his remote cousins. But when one comes to look closer at their character and antecedents, it becomes evident at once that there is a deal of unsuspected originality and caprice about sharks and <b>flat-fish.</b> Instead of conforming throughout to a single plan, as the young, the gay, the giddy, and the thoughtless are too prone to conclude, fish are in reality as various and variable in their mode of life as any other great group in the animal kingdom. Monogamy and polygamy, socialism and individualism, the patriarchal and matriarchal types of government, the oviparous and viviparous methods of reproduction, perhaps even the dissidence of dissent and esoteric Buddhism, all alike are well represented in one family or another of this extremely eclectic and philosophically unprejudiced class of animals.|$|R
6000|$|The Pleuronectidae, or <b>Flat-fish,</b> are {{remarkable}} for their asymmetrical bodies. They rest on one side--in the {{greater number of}} species on the left, but in some on the right side; and occasionally reversed adult specimens occur. The lower, or resting-surface, resembles at first sight the ventral surface of an ordinary fish; it is of a white colour, less developed in many ways than the upper side, with the lateral fins often of smaller size. But the eyes offer the most remarkable peculiarity; for they are both placed on the upper side of the head. During early youth, however, they stand opposite to each other, and the whole body is then symmetrical, with both sides equally coloured. Soon the eye proper to the lower side begins to glide slowly round the head to the upper side; but does not pass right through the skull, as was formerly {{thought to be the}} case. It is obvious that unless the lower eye did thus travel round, it could not be used by the fish while lying in its habitual position on one side. The lower eye would, also, have been liable to be abraded by the sandy bottom. That the Pleuronectidae are admirably adapted by their flattened and asymmetrical structure for their habits of life, is manifest from several species, such as soles, flounders, etc., being extremely common. The chief advantages thus gained seem to be protection from their enemies, and facility for feeding on the ground. The different members, however, of the family present, as Schiodte remarks, [...] "a long series of forms exhibiting a gradual transition from Hippoglossus pinguis, which does not in any considerable degree alter the shape in which it leaves the ovum, to the soles, which are entirely thrown to one side." ...|$|R
60|$|With such {{structures}} as {{the above}} lamellae of horn or whalebone, habit or use can {{have done little}} or nothing, {{as far as we}} can judge, towards their development. On the other hand, the transportal of the lower eye of a <b>flat-fish</b> to the upper side of the head, and the formation of a prehensile tail, may be attributed almost wholly to continued use, together with inheritance. With respect to the mammae of the higher animals, the most probable conjecture is that primordially the cutaneous glands over the whole surface of a marsupial sack secreted a nutritious fluid; and that these glands were improved in function through natural selection, and concentrated into a confined area, in which case they would have formed a mamma. There is no more difficulty in understanding how the branched spines of some ancient Echinoderm, which served as a defence, became developed through natural selection into tridactyle pedicellariae, than in understanding the development of the pincers of crustaceans, through slight, serviceable modifications in the ultimate and penultimate segments of a limb, which was at first used solely for locomotion. In the avicularia and vibracula of the Polyzoa we have organs widely different in appearance developed from the same source; and with the vibracula we can understand how the successive gradations might have been of service. With the pollinia of orchids, the threads which originally served to tie together the pollen-grains, can be traced cohering into caudicles; and the steps can likewise be followed by which viscid matter, such as that secreted by the stigmas of ordinary flowers, and still subserving nearly but not quite the same purpose, became attached to the free ends of the caudicles--all these gradations being of manifest benefit to the plants in question. With respect to climbing plants, I need not repeat what has been so lately said.|$|R
6000|$|Where the {{colouring}} {{of nature}} is absolutely uniform, {{as among the}} arctic snows or the chilly mountain tops, the colouring of the animals is uniform too. Where it is slightly diversified from point to point, as in the sands of the desert, the animals that imitate it are speckled or diversified with various soft neutral tints. All the birds, reptiles, and insects of Sahara, says Canon Tristram, copy closely the grey or isabelline colour of the boundless sands that stretch around them. Lord George Campbell, in his amusing 'Log Letters from the [...] "Challenger,"' mentions a butterfly on the shore at Amboyna which looked exactly like {{a bit of the}} beach, until it spread its wings and fluttered away gaily to leeward. Soles and other <b>flat-fish</b> similarly resemble the sands or banks on which they lie, and accommodate themselves specifically to the particular colour of their special bottom. Thus the flounder imitates the muddy bars at the mouths of rivers, where he loves to half bury himself in the congenial ooze; the sole, who rather affects clean hard sand-banks, is simply sandy and speckled with grey; the plaice, who goes in by preference for a bed of mixed pebbles, has red and yellow spots scattered up and down irregularly among the brown, to look as much as possible like agates and carnelians: the brill, who hugs a still rougher ledge, has {{gone so far as to}} acquire raised lumps or tubercles on his upper surface, which make him seem like a mere bit of the shingle-strewn rock on which he reposes. In short, where the environment is most uniform the colouring follows suit: just in proportion as the environment varies from place to place, the colouring must vary in order to simulate it. There is a deep biological joy in the term 'environment'; it almost rivals the well-known consolatory properties of that sweet word 'Mesopotamia.' 'Surroundings,' perhaps, would equally well express the meaning, but then, as Mr. Wordsworth justly observes, 'the difference to me!' ...|$|R
