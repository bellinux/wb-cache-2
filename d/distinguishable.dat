5|$|Final Resolution {{featured}} eight professional wrestling matches {{that involved}} different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|Hard Justice {{featured}} eight professional wrestling {{matches and}} one pre-show match that involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> characters; these scripted events built tension and {{culminated in a}} wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|Hard Justice {{featured}} seven professional wrestling matches {{that involved}} different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines.

5|$|The 2005 TNA Super X Cup Tournament {{featured}} seven matches involving numerous wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, {{heroes and}} less <b>distinguishable</b> characters in scripted events that built tension and culminated in wrestling matches.|$|E
5|$|The Chris Candido Memorial Tag Team Tournament {{featured}} seven matches involving different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in}} the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match.|$|E

5|$|A second, more {{traditional}} design followed {{for the initial}} batch of five unstreamlined locomotives (Nos. 6230–6234). Again they were of welded tank construction, but lacked any of the streamlining add-ons. Even without the streamlining Type 'B' tenders were <b>distinguishable</b> from Type 'A' by having a slightly different profile at the front and steps and handrails at the rear.|$|E
5|$|Against All Odds {{featured}} nine professional wrestling {{matches and}} two matches {{prior to the}} event that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|All {{ethnic groups}} speak Bulgarian, {{either as a}} first or as a second {{language}}. Bulgarian is the only language with official status and native for 85.2 percent of the population. The oldest written Slavic language, Bulgarian is <b>distinguishable</b> from the other languages in this group through certain grammatical peculiarities such as the lack of noun cases and infinitives, and a suffixed definite article.|$|E
5|$|Banksia integrifolia subsp. compar: This {{subspecies}} {{grows in}} coastal Queensland {{as far north}} as Proserpine. For most of its range it is the only subspecies, but near its southern limit it co-occurs with B.integrifolia subsp. integrifolia. The two subspecies are <b>distinguishable</b> by their leaves, which are larger and glossy with wavy margins on B.integrifolia subsp. compar.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory IV {{featured}} eight professional wrestling {{matches and}} one untelevised match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|Bound for Glory was {{scheduled}} to feature nine professional wrestling matches and one pre-show match, however, due to a medical emergency TNA was forced to change the main event of the show, resulting in ten overall matches. Each of these matches involved wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines portraying villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> characters; these scripted events built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|Destination X {{featured}} eight professional wrestling {{matches and}} one match {{prior to the}} event that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> characters in the scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|In tarsiers, the sublingua {{does not}} have {{serrations}} along its tip and is much simpler and generalized in structure, making it clearly <b>distinguishable</b> {{from that of the}} lemuriform primates. The tarsier has a distinct plica mediana and its plicae fimbriatae are large and stick to the entire underside of the tongue. The plica sublingualis is also prominent.|$|E
5|$|Lockdown {{featured}} eight professional wrestling {{matches and}} one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and that culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches. Every match was contested inside the Six Sides of Steel.|$|E
5|$|Recent DNA {{studies suggest}} that there are no more than three or four {{subspecies}} of elk. All American forms seem to belong to one subspecies (Cervus canadensis canadensis). Even the Siberian elk (Cervus canadensis sibiricus) are more or less identical to the American forms and therefore may belong to this subspecies, too. However the Manchurian wapiti (Cervus canadensis xanthopygus) is clearly distinct from the Siberian forms, but not <b>distinguishable</b> from the Alashan wapiti. The Chinese forms MacNeill's deer, Kansu red deer, and Tibetan red deer belong also to the wapitis and were not <b>distinguishable</b> from each other by mitochondrial DNA studies. These Chinese subspecies are sometimes treated as a distinct species, namely the Central Asian red deer (Cervus wallichi), which also includes the Kashmir stag.|$|E
5|$|Slammiversary {{featured}} nine professional wrestling {{matches and}} one pre-show matches that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|The 2008 TNA World X Cup Tournament {{featured}} eight matches {{that involved}} different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds, and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|The bulbous base, large spores, and {{distinctive}} habitat are characteristic features {{that make this}} species readily <b>distinguishable</b> from other boletes. It has a coloration and cap texture similar to Boletus flaviporus and B.auriporus, but the spores of these species are shorter (11–15µm and 11–16µm, respectively).|$|E
5|$|The only {{species that}} can {{potentially}} {{be confused with}} the Siberian accentor is the related black-throated accentor, since first-autumn birds of the latter species may have a relatively inconspicuous dark throat. The Siberian accentor is still <b>distinguishable</b> by its rustier back colour, yellow (not off-white) supercilium and the absence of a white line below the black face mask.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} easily <b>distinguishable</b> from other Chinese hares, having longer ears than the South Chinese Hare. Like the Woolly hare (Lepus oiostolus) and the South Chinese hare, an {{examination}} of the skull shows the groove on the front face of the upper incisors is filled with cement.|$|E
5|$|The {{spotted turtle}} and painted turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is <b>distinguishable</b> from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} spotted turtle is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|E
5|$|The two choughs are <b>distinguishable</b> {{from each}} other by their bill colour, and in flight the long broad wings and short tail of the red-billed give it a {{silhouette}} quite different from its slightly smaller yellow-billed relative. Both species fly with loose deep wing beats, and frequently use their manoeuvrability to perform acrobatic displays, soaring in the updraughts at cliff faces then diving and rolling with fanned tail and folded wings.|$|E
5|$|The water bull {{is said to}} {{reproduce}} with standard cattle, the resulting progeny <b>distinguishable</b> by {{the small size of}} their ears. According to some myths, the calves of water bulls and ordinary cows ought to be killed at birth by any method other than drowning– they cannot be killed by drowning– to avoid bringing disaster to the herd. Conversely, in northern areas the calves are considered to be of superior quality.|$|E
5|$|Turning Point {{featured}} nine professional wrestling {{matches and}} one pre-show match that involved different wrestlers from pre-existing scripted feuds and storylines. Wrestlers portrayed villains, heroes, or less <b>distinguishable</b> {{characters in the}} scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.|$|E
5|$|While the Arctic tern {{is similar}} to the common and roseate terns, its colouring, profile, and call are {{slightly}} different. Compared to the common tern, it has a longer tail and mono-coloured bill, while the main differences from the roseate are its slightly darker colour and longer wings. The Arctic tern's call is more nasal and rasping than that of the common, and is easily <b>distinguishable</b> from that of the roseate.|$|E
5|$|A 1920s {{adaptation}} {{created by}} the Stempel Type Foundry and released for hot metal typesetting by Linotype, that has remained popular. It is sharp, somewhat angular design with a crisp hook rather than a teardrop at top left of the 'a'. Stempel Garamond has relatively short descenders, allowing it to be particularly tightly linespaced. An unusual feature is the digit 0, which has reversed contrast, with the thickest points of {{the number on the}} top and bottom of the digit to make it more <b>distinguishable</b> from a 'o'. The Klingspor Museum credits it to Stempel's head of typeface development Dr. Rudolf Wolf.|$|E
5|$|A special {{relativistic}} redshift formula (and its classical approximation) {{can be used}} {{to calculate}} the redshift of a nearby object when spacetime is flat. However, in many contexts, such as black holes and Big Bang cosmology, redshifts must be calculated using general relativity. Special relativistic, gravitational, and cosmological redshifts can be understood under the umbrella of frame transformation laws. There exist other physical processes that can lead to a shift in the frequency of electromagnetic radiation, including scattering and optical effects; however, the resulting changes are <b>distinguishable</b> from true redshift and are not generally referred to as such (see section on physical optics and radiative transfer).|$|E
5|$|Compared to the {{nominate}} form, A. p. kleinschmidti has slightly yellower, less olive, upperparts {{and brighter}} and yellower underparts between the breast streaking. A. p. littoralis may show pinkish underparts and a pale supercilium (eyebrow) in summer, thereby resembling the water pipit. Vagrant Eurasian rock pipits in winter are readily <b>distinguishable</b> from water pipits, but {{very difficult to}} assign to subspecies by appearance or measurements. The western populations {{are known to be}} nearly sedentary, so east of the Elbe basin vagrant Eurasian rock pipits are presumably mostly littoralis.|$|E
5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, {{pale blue}} eyes and cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in the}} skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be <b>distinguishable</b> from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|Development on {{the project}} began in 2011 after the rights to Isaacson's book were acquired. Sorkin wrote the {{screenplay}} with filming beginning in January 2015. A variety of actors were considered and cast before Fassbender eventually took the role. Editing was extensive {{on the project}}, with editor Elliot Graham noting that {{he was working on}} existing footage while the film was still shooting. Daniel Pemberton served as the film's composer, with a focus dedicated to dividing the score into three <b>distinguishable</b> sections.|$|E
5|$|For Kant a {{good will}} is a broader {{conception}} than a will which acts from duty. A will which acts from duty is <b>distinguishable</b> as a will which overcomes hindrances {{in order to}} keep the moral law. A dutiful will is thus a special case of a good will which becomes visible in adverse conditions. Kant argues that only acts performed with regard to duty have moral worth. This is not to say that acts performed merely in accordance with duty are worthless (these still deserve approval and encouragement), but that special esteem is given to acts which are performed out of duty.|$|E
5|$|For the Narnians, Berger envisioned them as more wild in appearance, as {{they have}} been forced into the forests. He also decided to {{increase}} the portrayal of various ages, sizes and races. The black dwarfs are distinguished from the red dwarfs {{as they have}} more leather and jewellery, and a darker colour scheme in their costumes. Each race of creatures also had their fighting styles made more <b>distinguishable.</b> The minotaurs have maces, and the centaurs use swords. The satyrs were redesigned, as their creation on the first film had been rushed. 4,600 make-up jobs were performed, which Berger believes is a record.|$|E
5|$|Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows was {{released}} simultaneously on 21 July 2007, {{in both the}} UK and the United States. The UK edition features the voice of Stephen Fry and runs about 24 hours while the U.S. edition features the voice of Jim Dale and runs about 21 hours. Both Fry and Dale recorded 146 different and <b>distinguishable</b> character voices, and was the most recorded by an individual on an audiobook at the time.|$|E
