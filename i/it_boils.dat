5|$|Liquid helium {{below its}} lambda point (called heliumII) {{exhibits}} very unusual characteristics. Due to its high thermal conductivity, when <b>it</b> <b>boils,</b> {{it does not}} bubble but rather evaporates directly from its surface. Helium-3 also has a superfluid phase, but only at much lower temperatures; as a result, less {{is known about the}} properties of the isotope.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen and {{fluorine}} {{combine to}} yield hydrogen fluoride, in which discrete molecules form clusters by hydrogen bonding, resembling water more than hydrogen chloride. <b>It</b> <b>boils</b> {{at a much}} higher temperature than heavier hydrogen halides and unlike them is fully miscible with water. Hydrogen fluoride readily hydrates on contact with water to form aqueous hydrogen fluoride, also known as hydrofluoric acid. Unlike the other hydrohalic acids, which are strong, hydrofluoric acid is a weak acid at low concentrations. However, it can attack glass, something the other acids cannot do.|$|E
25|$|Water {{is a good}} {{conductor}} of heat but has drawbacks as a cutting fluid. <b>It</b> <b>boils</b> easily, promotes rusting of machine parts, and does not lubricate well. Therefore, other ingredients are necessary to create an optimal cutting fluid.|$|E

50|$|Clean {{and wash}} the meat. Put it into {{cold water and}} <b>boil</b> <b>it.</b> After <b>boiling</b> <b>it</b> {{for the first time}} pour the liquid off, pour fresh water on <b>it</b> and <b>boil</b> again. After that add the spices and the flavorings to <b>it.</b> <b>Boil</b> <b>it</b> slowly until it is ready. Take the big bones out of the meat and then put them into plates. Clean the fat {{from the surface of the}} liquid then pour the liquid into the plates onto the meat. After that put the plates to a cold place, let it cool down. Before serving you can put either red pepper or black pepper on the top or you can serve it with lemon also.|$|R
25|$|A {{hypothetical}} azeotrope of constituents X and Y {{is shown}} in the adjacent diagram. Two at an arbitrarily chosen low pressure and another at an arbitrarily chosen, but higher, pressure. The composition of the azeotrope is substantially different between the high- and low-pressure plots – higher in X for the high-pressure system. The goal is to separate X in as high a concentration as possible starting from point A. At the low pressure, it is possible by progressive distillation to reach a distillate at the point, B, which is {{on the same side of}} the azeotrope as A. Note that successive distillation steps near the azeotropic composition exhibit very little difference in boiling temperature. If this distillate is now exposed to the high pressure, <b>it</b> <b>boils</b> at point C. From C, by progressive distillation it is possible to reach a distillate at the point D, which is on the same side of the high-pressure azeotrope as C. If that distillate is then exposed again to the low pressure, <b>it</b> <b>boils</b> at point E, which is on the opposite side of the low-pressure azeotrope to A. So, by means of the pressure swing, it is possible to cross over the low-pressure azeotrope.|$|E
25|$|In active {{volcanic}} zones such as Yellowstone National Park, {{water may}} be heated by coming {{into contact with}} magma (molten rock). The high temperature gradient near magma may cause water to be heated enough that <b>it</b> <b>boils</b> or becomes superheated. If the water becomes so hot that it builds steam pressure and erupts in a jet above {{the surface of the}} Earth, it is called a geyser. If the water only reaches the surface in the form of steam, it is called a fumarole. If the water is mixed with mud and clay, it is called a mud pot.|$|E
25|$|On March 22, 2015, Saga University {{opened a}} Flash-type {{desalination}} demonstration facility on Kumejima. This satellite of their Institute of Ocean Energy uses post-OTEC deep seawater from the Okinawa OTEC Demonstration Facility and raw surface seawater to produce desalinated water. Air is {{extracted from the}} closed system with a vacuum pump. When raw sea water is pumped into the flash chamber <b>it</b> <b>boils,</b> allowing pure steam to rise and the salt and remaining seawater to be removed. The steam is returned to liquid in a heat exchanger with cold post-OTEC deep seawater. The desalinated water {{can be used in}} hydrogen production or drinking water (if minerals are added).|$|E
5000|$|R-408A is a zeotropic HCFC {{blend of}} R-22, R-125, and R-143a. It is a {{substitute}} for R-502. <b>Its</b> <b>boiling</b> point is -44.4 °C.|$|R

25|$|White fuming {{nitric acid}}, pure nitric acid or WFNA, {{is very close}} to {{anhydrous}} nitric acid. It is available as 99.9% nitric acid by assay. One specification for white fuming nitric acid is that it has a maximum of 2% water and a maximum of 0.5% dissolved NO2. Anhydrous nitric acid has a density of 1.513g/cm3 and has the approximate concentration of 24 molar. Anhydrous nitric acid is a colorless mobile liquid with a density of 1.512g/cm3, which solidifies at −42°C to form white crystals. As it decomposes to NO2 and water, it obtains a yellow tint. <b>It</b> <b>boils</b> at 83°C. It is usually stored in a glass shatterproof amber bottle with twice the volume of head space to allow for pressure build up, but even with those precautions the bottle must be vented monthly to release pressure.|$|E
25|$|The launch {{countdown}} began 10 June 2009, but on 13 June 2009, as tanking was underway, a {{gaseous hydrogen}} leak on a vent line near the Ground Umbilical Carrier Plate was observed, and the 13 June 2009 launch was scrubbed at 00:26 EDT. As liquid hydrogen fuel is pumped in, some of <b>it</b> <b>boils</b> {{off as the}} extremely cold liquid enters the warm external tank. The vent line valve controls the resulting buildup of gas pressure by allowing excess gas to escape into a ground-side vent line, {{which leads to a}} flare stack at a safe distance away from the pad. A similar leak situation was seen during the first launch attempt of STS-119. NASA managers met on 14 June 2009 and 15 June 2009 and evaluated the leak, discussed steps that had to be taken, and set a new launch date of 17 June 2009, at 05:40 EDT.|$|E

500|$|The {{principle}} for continuous distillation {{is the same}} as for normal distillation: [...] when a liquid mixture is heated so that <b>it</b> <b>boils,</b> the composition of the vapor above the liquid differs from the liquid composition.

I am in favor {{of any kind of}} technical innovation but it needs to exceed what has gone before and so far nothing has exceeded anything that's come before". Nolan's major concern is that the film industry's adoption of digital formats has been driven purely by economic factors as opposed to digital being a superior medium to film, saying: [...] "I think, truthfully, <b>it</b> <b>boils</b> down to the economic interest of manufacturers and [...] industry that makes more money through change rather than through maintaining the status quo." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the case}} of {{evaporation}} of water to steam, the place occupied by water would be occupied by water vapor, which has a density vastly {{lower than that of}} liquid water (the exact number depends on pressure and temperature; at standard conditions, steam is about [...] as dense as liquid water). Because of this lower density (of mass, and consequently of atom nuclei able to absorb neutrons), light water's neutron-absorption capability practically disappears when <b>it</b> <b>boils.</b> This allows more neutrons to fission more U-235 nuclei and thereby increase the reactor power, which leads to higher temperatures that boil even more water, creating a thermal feedback loop.|$|E
