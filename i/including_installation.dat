5|$|Further {{work was}} {{undertaken}} in Perth in 2011 and 2012, between John Street in Bentley and Leach Highway. The road was widened and a median installed to increase both safety and efficiency. The works also upgraded intersection, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of new traffic lights. Downer EDI Works Pty Ltd completed the work under a $3.65 million contract.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, {{the venue}} was {{upgraded}} for €1 million by installing a K60 inrun between the normal and large hill. This allowed the medium inrun {{to use the}} same outrun as the normal hill. In 2008, a small K25 hill, named Ninoufbakken, was installed slightly away from the main hills. The venue's certificate was due to expire in 2011, after which the venue would have to meet the International Ski Federation's (FIS) latest regulations. A €1.5 million upgrade program was initiated, which saw the inruns renovated, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of the Ski-Line track system and new Porsgrund ceramic tracks. The outruns saw new plastic mats and a new sprinkler system. The Nordic House, a sports centre, was also built. Construction started on the normal hill in May 2011 and on the large hill in August 2011, with completion scheduled for early 2012.|$|E
5|$|In January 1943, Centaur {{was handed}} over to the Australian {{military}} for conversion into a hospital ship, as the ship's small size made her suitable for operating in Maritime Southeast Asia. The refit (<b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of medical facilities and repainting with Red Cross markings) was completed in March, and the ship undertook a trial voyage: transporting wounded from Townsville to Brisbane, then from Port Moresby to Brisbane. After replenishing in Sydney, Centaur embarked the 2/12th Field Ambulance for transport to New Guinea, and sailed on 12 May. Before dawn on 14 May 1943, during her second voyage, Centaur was torpedoed and sunk by a Japanese submarine off North Stradbroke Island, Queensland. The majority of the 332 aboard died in the attack; the 64 survivors were discovered 36 hours later. The incident resulted in public outrage as attacking a hospital ship is considered a war crime under the tenth 1907 Hague Convention. Protests were made by the Australian and British governments to Japan and efforts were made to discover the people responsible so they could be tried at a war crimes tribunal. In the 1970s the probable identity of the attacking submarine, I-177, became public.|$|E

The larger engine required significant changes to the airframe, particularly the engine compartment. The contra-rotating propellers also created instability that required an increase in fin area, all of which cost Browning more than $300,000.|$|E
25|$|After a {{contract}} was won by Montreal contractors E.G.M. Cape and Company in December 1937, the arch and {{base for the}} monument were constructed in Ottawa. Sydney March directed the construction {{with the assistance of}} his brothers. The monument, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of the bronzes, was finished on 19 October 1938, and landscaping of the area surrounding the memorial commenced. Everything was completed in time for the Royal visit the following spring. The National War Memorial of Canada commemorates the Canadian response during World War I. King George VI performed the unveiling of the monument on 21 May 1939 during a ceremony with an audience of an estimated 100,000.|$|E

25|$|After major {{modifications}} and upgrades, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of a two-stage turbocharger {{in place of}} its original single-stage unit, a larger fuel tank and additional intercooling capacity, the ALTUS II returned to flight status {{in the summer of}} 1998. The goal of its development test flights was to reach one of the major Level 2 performance milestones within NASA's ERAST program: to fly a gasoline-fueled, piston-engine remotely piloted aircraft for several hours at an altitude at or near 60,000 feet. On March 5, 1999, The ALTUS II maintained flight at or above 55,000 feet for three hours, reaching a maximum density altitude of 57,300 feet during the mission.|$|E
25|$|The first {{upgrades}} {{were performed}} between Åsjordet and Montebello, including {{the last part}} of the line from Montebello to Sørbyhaugen. Husebybakken continued as Line 6's terminus until 31 May 2008, after which it was demolished. The first three upgraded stations, Montebello, Ullernåsen and Åsjordet, were put back into the service of Line 6 from 18 August. The upgrades were similar to those to the Røa Line in 1995, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of third rail, straight platforms long enough for six-car trains, a new signaling system as well as all-new permanent way and stations. From 22 June 2009 only MX3000 trains were used on the line, and from 11 April 2010 some of the departures started running with six-car trains.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, due to {{a series}} of crashes {{involving}} in-flight structural failure during simulated combat flights, the entire US civilian fleet of T-34A/Bs was grounded by the Federal Aviation Administration. The grounding has since been eased to a slate of restrictions on the permitted flight envelope. Via a series of Airworthiness Directives (ADs) established by or Alternate Methods of Compliance (AMOCs) negotiated with the FAA, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of certain, approved structural modifications to the wing spar and other repairs, the T-34A and T-34B fleet in 2011 has been restored to full flight status by FAA at the Mentor's originally designed limitations, provided each individual example is compliant with those ADs and AMOCs.|$|E

25|$|The {{investigators}} made {{a number}} of recommendations. Chief among them were a redesign of the air-start unit, to permit the exhaust to be blown upward instead of to the side, and educating flight-deck personnel on ordnance cookoff temperatures and times; implementation of a longer huffer air-supply hose, which delivers the air needed to start aircraft and which had already been accomplished aboard USS Constellation due to concerns about ordnance cookoff from huffer exhaust, was also recommended fleetwide. Many other recommendations were made, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of redundant communication and control systems, improved communication between key senior personnel, and a redesign of the head covering worn by flight deck firefighters. Investigators also recommended cross-training shipboard dentists as anesthesiologists; a dentist so trained was assigned to Enterprise, giving the medical department the ability to perform additional emergency surgery during the fire.|$|E
25|$|Elsie {{and five}} of her {{brothers}} completed the bronze statues for the memorial. The siblings moulded the figures in clay, cast them in plaster, and then created the bronzes at their studio foundry at Goddendene, completing the work by July 1932. However, construction of the arch of the monument in Canada could not start because the site was not prepared. Instead, the bronze memorial groups were mounted on a base and displayed at Hyde Park in London for six months. Later, the figures were stored in the studio at Goddendene; they were sent to Ottawa in 1937. It was there that the memorial base and arch were built after a contract was won by Montreal contractors E.G.M. Cape and Company in December 1937. March family members directed construction of the granite monument. The memorial, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of the bronzes, was completed on 19 October 1938. Landscaping of the surrounding area was completed {{in time for the}} Royal visit the following spring.|$|E
25|$|The first {{conveying}} {{started in}} 1917, {{and the following}} January the city engineer started construction, but this soon terminated. At the same time Graakalbanen started preparing the first lots for sale, <b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of water, sewage and roads. In June 1919, the engineering company Grøndahl & Kjørholt took over the work, planning to be finished to Lian by 1921. However, by June 1920, the rising prices resulted in the money being used up. At {{the same time it}} turned out that the rolling stock was too much more expensive than expected; ordering of rolling stock was therefore delayed. In 1921, no construction was done on the line. Not before Trondhjems og Stridens Sparebank issued a loan of NOK 1.6 million was it possible to continue construction. This was based on mortgaging all assets, as well as a NOK 500,000 guarantee from the city council. While work previously had been along the whole route, it was then only concentrated on the section Ila–Munkvoll, where the depot would be located.|$|E

2500|$|School {{district}} trustees approved $150,000 in 2010 {{to conduct}} an architectural study of the building. Representatives from seven architectural and engineering firms toured the facility on June 30, 2011. In 2015, GFPS officials proposed a $98 million bond levy to improve GFHS, C.M. Russell High School, and 20 of the city's elementary and middle schools. The proposal included $20.76 million in infrastructure improvements at GFHS, to include a new heating and ventilation system; replacement of all electrical outlets and circuit-breaker panels; replacement of all fresh water pipes, sinks, toilets, and water fountains; replacement of insulation-covered 1960s windows with new energy-efficient windows; remodeling of all main building classrooms (<b>including</b> <b>installation</b> of audio-visual and other flexible modern teaching technology); creation of new parking areas; installation of a main fiber optic line in the main building, with a peripheral line to each classroom; and construction of a reliable and high-speed wireless system throughout the campus. The proposal also included $16.57 million in new constructure at Great Falls High, including construction of a [...] "Hub" [...] building containing career and technical education (CTE) classrooms; eight science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) classrooms; a modern and expanded cafeteria and dining space; an informal social and gathering space for students; two new main entrances to the school (replacing the existing main building and fieldhouse entrances). The [...] Hub would also act as a bridging structure, connecting the main building, existing industrial arts annex, fieldhouse, and South Campus so that students would {{no longer need to}} go outdoors to move from one facility to another. It would also make access to all four building much easier for students with physical disabilities. Another $705,000 would be spent replacing sod at Memorial Stadium with artificial turf, to allow more use and generate more revenue as well as to cut down substantially on maintenance costs. The running track would also be resurfaced. Another $250,000 would be spent upgrading the school's antiquated telephone system. About $975,000 would be used to transform grassy areas into student parking. Voters approved the high school levy on October 4, 2016, by 60.9 percent (11,341 to 7,187).|$|E
