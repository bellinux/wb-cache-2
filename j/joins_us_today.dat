Recognizing that today’s briefers are a subset of the Committee, I’d like to thank all the ACRS {{committee}} members for their service. The Commission really highly values their advice that the committee provides to us on the important issues that are before us. The members, of course, bring an impressive array of knowledge and experience, which they bring to bear on their views on these topics that we discuss.

40|$|The Act Out {{event is}} {{organized}} around the work of today’s Nordic women video artists, but in this essay I would like to propose a feminist approach {{to a number of}} video pieces by Portuguese women artists concerning issues related to gender, class and nationality, among other social-political themes, which they have in common with their Nordic counterparts <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> here <b>today.</b> There's not a long history of Portuguese video art or a Portuguese women's video art tradition related to feminist issues, like in Northern European countries. However, it's possible to trace features in contemporary Portuguese women video works to the third wave inclusive feminisms, namely the importance of women identities' multiplicity and difference and the complex interrelatedness between codings of gender, race, nationality, language, class, etc...|$|R

40|$|The Prime Minister of Australia, the Hon John Howard MP, today officially {{opened the}} Sydney Campus of The University of Notre Dame Australia, amid the {{presence}} of distinguished guests, including the Cardinal Archbishop of Sydney, Cardinal George Pell. The Sydney Campus of Notre Dame opened its doors this week to 450 foundation students, studying in six Schools: Arts and Sciences, Business, Education, Law, Nursing, and Philosophy and Theology. Notre Dame, a private Catholic university, {{has been established in}} Western Australia for 15 years, and its move to the east coast, at the invitation of Cardinal Pell, reflects the importance of an enhanced Catholic higher education presence, starting in Sydney. Notre Dame Australia Vice Chancellor, Dr Peter Tannock, says the University owes a debt of gratitude to both the Prime Minister and Cardinal Pell for their support and encouragement of this venture. ‘We are delighted that the Prime Minister and also the former Minister of Education, the Hon Dr Brendan Nelson MP, have graciously <b>joined</b> <b>us</b> <b>today.</b> ‘Cardinal Pell’s vision for the rejuvenation of St Benedict’s and also Sacred Heart Parish at Darlinghurst, has enabled Notre Dame to establish itself in Sydney. ‘The Broadway Campus is centrally located on the historic St Benedict’s site. The University has magnificently restored and transformed two former schools and parish buildings into a splendid campus of higher education. ‘An important aspect of the new Campus is St Benedict’s Church, which has been restored to its rightful position and a significant Sydney landmark. ‘Notre Dame will make a substantial contribution to the diversity and quality of higher education in Sydney. ‘We aim to replicate the beauty of the Broadway campus on the Darlinghurst site, where it is proposed to open a Medical School in 2008. ‘Both Campuses will see the revival of these places of historical significance to the church and community of Sydney,’ Dr Tannock said. ‘I am grateful to the foundation students and their families who have placed trust in Notre Dame. Our dedicated staff, under the leadership of Peter Glasson, Executive Director and Professor George Kailis, Assistant Provost, will confirm the important choice they have made. ‘I also wish to acknowledge the Parish Priest of St Benedict’s, Fr John Neill op and his parishioners, whose co-operation and support has facilitated the successful restoration of St Benedict’s Church,’ Dr Tannock said...|$|R
40|$|Today’s {{hearing is}} the first in a two-part series that will examine the issues {{surrounding}} the treatment of migrants by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. And the first of the series, this hearing today, we will have two panels, which will primarily focus on the issue of detention. I would like to begin by thanking our witnesses: Mr. John Torres, Mr. Richard Seiter, Ms. Michelle Brane´, Ms. Christina Fiflis, and Mr. Michael Cutler. And thank you for <b>joining</b> <b>us</b> <b>today</b> to discuss these important issues. With the end of the ‘‘catch and release’’ program, the Department of Homeland Security faces a daunting challenge: how to deal with hundreds, perhaps thousands, of migrants that have been detained in recent enforcement actions. But the challenge is not only for law enforcement. It is also a humanitarian challenge. Our goal must not only be to detain migrants, but also to make sure that their detention is humane. And at the same time, we must explore alternatives to detention that meet our law enforcement goals and that may provide more humane conditions for these detainees. Recently, reports have signaled that detention conditions and the treatment of detainees in administrative immigration detection have not been acceptable. I have found these reports very disturbing, and so have many of my colleagues. And I hope that this hearing will shed some light on the situation and lead to action points by which we can improve the conditions of these detainees. And I am particularly interested in learning more about the Immigration and Customs Enforcement standards for care and custody of these detainees. These standards need to include a guarantee for detainees to be treated humanely and, of course, to have access to counsel. It is also critical that the subcommittee {{gain a better understanding of}} how ICE and their detention contractors work together to meet these minimum standards. In addition, I am looking forward to hearing about alternatives to detention that can appropriately monitor individuals but ensure that they show up to all the necessary hearings. As a nation, we must be committed to treating detainees appropriately, with respect for their dignity as fellow human beings and in accordance with our laws, our traditions, and, quite frankly, the idea of this great country. Recent reports indicate that we have some work to do before we achieve all of this, and I hope this hearing gives us some sense of the progress that we have made on these issues...|$|R
