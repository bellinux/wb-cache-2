40|$|<b>Fendiline,</b> an {{effective}} anti-anginal drug {{for the treatment}} of coronary heart diseases, and its sixteen analogues were resolved on a CSP based on (+) -(18 -crown- 6) - 2, 3, 11, 12 -tetracarboxylic acid. <b>Fendiline</b> was resolved quite well with the separation factor (α) of 1. 25 and resolution (RS) of 1. 55 when a mobile phase consisting of methanol–acetonitrile–trifluoroacetic acid–triethylamine at a ratio of 80 / 20 / 0. 1 / 0. 5 (v/v/v/v) was used. The comparison of the chromatographic behaviors for the resolution of <b>fendiline</b> and its analogues indicated that the 3, 3 -diphenylpropyl group bonded to the secondary amino group of <b>fendiline</b> is important in the chiral recognition and the difference in the steric bulkiness between the phenyl group and the methyl group at the chiral center of <b>fendiline</b> is also important in the chiral recognition...|$|E
40|$|Leishmaniasis and Chagas {{disease are}} {{neglected}} parasitic diseases endemic in developing countries; {{efforts to find}} new therapies remain a priority. Calcium channel blockers (CCBs) are drugs in clinical use for hypertension and other heart pathologies. Based on previous reports about the antileishmanial activity of dihydropyridine-CCBs, this work aimed to investigate whether the in vitro anti-Leishmania infantum and anti-Trypanosoma cruzi activities of this therapeutic class would be shared by other non-dihydropyridine-CCBs. Except for amrinone, our results demonstrated antiprotozoal activity for <b>fendiline,</b> mibefradil, and lidoflazine, with IC 50 values in a range between 2 and 16 [*]μM and Selectivity Index between 4 and 10. <b>Fendiline</b> demonstrated depolarization of mitochondrial membrane potential, with increased reactive oxygen species production in amlodipine and <b>fendiline</b> treated Leishmania, but without plasma membrane disruption. Finally, in vitro combinations of amphotericin B, miltefosine, and pentamidine against L. infantum showed in isobolograms an additive interaction when these drugs were combined with <b>fendiline,</b> resulting in overall mean sum of fractional inhibitory concentrations between 0. 99 and 1. 10. These data demonstrated that non-dihydropyridine-CCBs present antiprotozoal activity and could be useful candidates for future in vivo efficacy studies against Leishmaniasis and Chagas’ disease...|$|E
40|$|Ras {{proteins}} regulate signaling pathways {{important for}} cell growth, differentiation, and survival. Oncogenic mutant Ras proteins are commonly expressed in human tumors, with mutations of the K-Ras isoform being most prevalent. To be active, K-Ras must undergo posttranslational processing and {{associate with the}} plasma membrane. We therefore devised a high-content screening assay to search for inhibitors of K-Ras plasma membrane association. Using this assay, we identified <b>fendiline,</b> an L-type calcium channel blocker, as a specific inhibitor of K-Ras plasma membrane targeting with no detectable effect on the localization of H- and N-Ras. Other classes of L-type calcium channel blockers did not mislocalize K-Ras, suggesting a mechanism that is unrelated to calcium channel blockade. <b>Fendiline</b> did not inhibit K-Ras posttranslational processing but significantly reduced nanoclustering of K-Ras and redistributed K-Ras from the plasma membrane to the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), Golgi apparatus, endosomes, and cytosol. <b>Fendiline</b> significantly inhibited signaling downstream of constitutively active K-Ras and endogenous K-Ras signaling in cells transformed by oncogenic H-Ras. Consistent with these effects, <b>fendiline</b> blocked the proliferation of pancreatic, colon, lung, and endometrial cancer cell lines expressing oncogenic mutant K-Ras. Taken together, {{these results suggest that}} inhibitors of K-Ras plasma membrane localization may have utility as novel K-Ras-specific anticancer therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe fungal {{pathogen}} Cryptococcus neoformans poses a {{major threat}} to immunocompromised patients and is a leading killer of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patients worldwide. Cryptococci are known to manipulate host macrophages and can either remain latent or proliferate intracellularly within the host phagocyte, a favourable niche that also renders them relatively insensitive to antifungal agents. Here we report an attempt to address this limitation by using a fluorescence-based drug screening method to identify potential inhibitors of intracellular proliferation of C. [*]neoformans. The Prestwick Chemical Library® of FDA-approved small molecules was screened for compounds that limit the intracellular replication of a fluorescently-tagged C. [*]neoformans reference strain (H 99 -GFP) in macrophages. Preliminary screening revealed 19 of 1200 compounds that could significantly reduce intracellular growth of the pathogen. Secondary screening and host cell cytotoxicity assays highlighted <b>fendiline</b> hydrochloride as a potential drug candidate for the development of future anticryptococcal therapies. Live cell imaging demonstrated that this Ca 2 + channel blocker strongly enhanced phagosome maturation in macrophages leading to improved fungal killing and reduced intracellular replication. Whilst the relatively high dose of <b>fendiline</b> hydrochloride required renders it unfit for clinical deployment against cryptococcosis, this study highlights a novel approach for identifying new lead compounds and unravels a pharmacologically promising scaffold towards the development of novel antifungal therapies for this neglected disease...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, {{the effects of}} {{different}} allosteric modulators on the functional activity of gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) B receptors in membranes of post-mortem human frontal cortex were examined. Western blot analysis indicated that the tissue preparations expressed both GABA(B 1) and GABA(B 2) subunits of the GABA(B) receptor heterodimer. In [35 S]-GTPgammaS binding assays, Ca 2 + ion (1 mM) enhanced the potency of the agonists GABA and 3 -aminopropylphosphinic acid (3 -APA) {{and that of the}} antagonist CGP 55845, but not that of the GABA(B) receptor agonist (-) -baclofen. CGP 7930 (2, 6 -di-t-Bu- 4 -(3 -hydroxy- 2, 2 -dimethyl-propyl) -phenol), a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(B) receptors, potentiated both GABA(B) receptor-mediated stimulation of [35 S]-GTPgammaS binding and inhibition of forskolin (FSK) -stimulated adenylyl cyclase activity. Chelation of Ca 2 + ion by EGTA reduced the CGP 7930 enhancement of GABA potency in stimulating [35 S]-GTPgammaS binding by two-fold. <b>Fendiline,</b> also reported to act as a positive allosteric modulator of GABA(B) receptors, failed to enhance GABA stimulation of [35 S]-GTPgammaS binding but inhibited the potentiating effect of CGP 7930. The inhibitory effect was mimicked by the phenothiazine antipsychotic trifluoperazine (TFP), but not by other compounds, such as verapamil or diphenydramine (DPN). These data demonstrate that the function of GABA(B) receptors of human frontal cortex is positively modulated by Ca 2 + ion and CGP 7930, which interact synergistically. Conversely, <b>fendiline</b> and trifluoperazine negatively affect the allosteric regulation by CGP 7930...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA virtual screening, {{involving}} flexible docking sequences {{within the}} LuxR, TraR and LasR binding sites, {{was used as}} a structural binding sites similarity filter to specifically target conserved residues in the proteins of the LuxR family (namely Tyr 62, Trp 66, Tyr 70, Asp 79, Trp 94 for LuxR). This docking-based screening, employing a genetic algorithm, was performed on a 2344 chemical compounds library, together with empirical binding free energy (DeltaG(bind)) calculations. Docking results were analysed, and the compounds detected with reproducible low DeltaG(bind) values or identified as being in the top 120 for most of the docking sequences, were selected as hits candidates which interact with conserved residues. Biological evaluation with LuxR-dependent quorum sensing led to the discovery of some new inhibitors, namely tamoxifen, sertraline, pimethixene, terfenadine, <b>fendiline</b> and calmidazolium. Notably, calmidazolium was identified {{as one of the most}} potent AHL-structurally unrelated inhibitors of LuxR-dependent quorum sensing, with an IC(50) value of 7. 0 +/- 0. 2 microM...|$|E
40|$|Using grease-gap {{recording}} from rat neocortical slices, the gamma-aminobutyric acid(B) (GABA(B)) receptor agonists baclofen (3 - 100 microM) and SKF 97541 (3 -aminopropyl-methylphosphinic acid) (1 - 30 microM) elicited reversible and concentration-dependent hyperpolarizing responses, with EC(50) {{values of}} 10 and 3 microM, respectively. The hyperpolarizations were antagonised by the GABA(B) receptor antagonist Sch 50911 ((+) -(S) - 5, 5 -dimethylmorpholinyl- 2 -acetic acid) (1, 5 and 10 microM). <b>Fendiline</b> (N-[3, 3 -diphenylpropyl) -alpha-methylbenzylamine) (5 - 50 microM) and its congeners, prenylamine (N-[3, 3 -diphenylpropyl) -alpha-methylphenylethylamine) (10 - 100 microM) and F 551 (N-[3, 3 -diphenylpropyl) -alpha-methyl- 3 -methoxybenzylamine) (1 - 30 microM) reversibly enhanced hyperpolarizing {{responses to the}} agonists; such effects were reduced by Sch 50911. These arylalkylamines produced leftward shifts of the concentration-response curves, with a marked increase in the maximal hyperpolarization obtained, compared with the agonists alone, F 551 being the most potent. These findings suggest that these arylalkylamines represent {{a new class of}} positive modulators of GABA(B) receptor-mediated function...|$|E
40|$|Ca 2 + binding to calmodulin in the pCa range 5. 5 - 7. 0 exposes {{hydrophobic}} {{sites that}} bind hydrophobic inhibitory ligands, including calmodulin antagonists, some Ca 2 +-antagonists and calmodulin-binding proteins. The binding of these hydrophobic ligands to calmodulin can {{be followed by}} the approx. 80 % fluorescence increase they produce in dansylated (5 -dimethylaminonaphthalene- 1 -sulphonylated) calmodulin (CDRDANS). In the presence of Ca 2 +, calmodulin binds the calmodulin inhibitor, R 24571, with an affinity of approx. 2 - 3 nM and hydrophobic ligands, including trifluoperazine (TFP), W- 7 [N-(6 -aminohexyl) - 5 -chloronaphthalene- 1 -sulphonamide], <b>fendiline,</b> felodipine and prenylamine, with affinities in the micromolar range. This binding is strongly Ca 2 +-dependent and Mg 2 +-independent. Calmodulin shows a reasonably high degree of specificity in its binding of these ligands over other ligands tested. CDRDANS, therefore, provides a convenient and simple means of monitoring the interaction {{of a variety of}} hydrophobic ligands with the Ca 2 +-dependent regulatory protein, calmodulin. CDRDANS binds to phospholipid vesicles made of (dimyristoyl) phosphatidylcholine (DMPC) or (dipalmitoyl) phosphatidylcholine (DPPC) and produces fluorescence increases only in the presence of Ca 2 + and at temperatures above their gel-to-liquid crystalline phase transition. Although the fluorescence changes in CDRDANS accurately report phase transitions in these liposomes, its binding to these vesicles is weak. Calmodulin probably requires a high-affinity lipid-bound receptor protein for its high-affinity binding to natural membranes...|$|E
40|$|The Ca 2 + {{stores of}} Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae {{take part in}} control of homoeostasis of the cytosolic free Ca 2 + {{concentration}} ([Ca 2 +]i) and the cyclic-AMP-induced [Ca 2 +]i-signalling cascade. In order to characterize regulatory mechanisms of these stores, we incubated cells with the calmodulin antagonist calmidazolium. Measurement of permeabilized and intact cells in suspension with a Ca(2 +) -sensitive electrode revealed that calmidazolium induced Ca 2 + release from intracellular stores, influx of Ca 2 + across the plasma membrane and subsequent efflux. In single fura- 2 -loaded cells calmidazolium evoked rapid and global transient elevations of [Ca 2 +]i. Other calmodulin antagonists (trifluoperazine, chlorpromazine, <b>fendiline</b> and W 7) also induced transient elevations of [Ca 2 +]i, which were, however, slower and observed in fewer cells. The calmidazolium-induced influx of extracellular Ca 2 + was inhibited by preincubation with 2, 5 -di-(t-butyl) - 1, 4 -hydroquinone (BHQ) and 7 -chloro- 4 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazole (NBD-Cl), both known to interact with pumps of the inositol 1, 4, 5 -trisphosphate (IP 3) -sensitive store, and by the V-type H(+) -ATPase inhibitor bafilomycin A 1, which affects the acidosomal Ca 2 + store. Incubation with pump inhibitors did not itself induce changes in [Ca 2 +]i. We conclude {{that the effects of}} calmidazolium are, at least in part, mediated by its calmodulin-antagonizing properties, that it acts by inducing Ca 2 + release from filled storage compartments, and that its target of action is both the IP 3 -sensitive store and the acidosome; emptying of these stores leads to influx of extracellular Ca 2 +...|$|E
40|$|Sodium {{salicylate}} (5 - 10 mM) {{has been}} used to distinguish the effects of the three calcium-antagonist subgroups which had been previously differentiated in functional studies. Sodium salicylate (10 mM) reduced the antagonistic effects of verapamil and diltiazem on Ca 2 +-induced contractions of K+ (40 mM) -depolarized taenia preparations from the guinea-pig caecum. In contrast, salicylate had no effect on the potency of nifedipine and increased the inhibitory effects of cinnarizine and flunarizine. Sodium salicylate (10 mM) had little effect on Ca 2 +-induced contractions per se. In preparations pretreated with calcium-antagonists and recontracted with high concentrations of Ca 2 +, salicylate (5 mM) caused an additional contraction when the preparations had been pretreated with verapamil or diltiazem but had no effect in control or nifedipine-treated preparations. In contrast, salicylate relaxed Ca 2 +-induced contractions in tissues which had been pretreated with cinnarizine, flunarizine, pimozide, bepridil, <b>fendiline,</b> perhexiline and with the calmodulin antagonist W- 7. The mechanism of action of salicylate was investigated. Inhibition of prostaglandin biosynthesis or of oxidative phosphorylation by salicylate was not responsible for these effects because indomethacin (28 microM) and 2, 4 -dinitrophenol (20 microM) did not differentiate between calcium antagonists. The effects of salicylate are ascribed to an increase in negative surface charge on the membrane because other agents changing surface charge (3, 5 -dichlorosalicylate, 0. 3 mM; benzoate, 20 mM) have similar effects and their potency is dependent on their affinity for lipid membranes. Furthermore, salicylate increased the effectiveness of the cationic local anaesthetic, (+) -propranolol (100 microM), but did not change the effects of the neutral local anesthetic, benzocaine (1 mM). It is argued that salicylate increases the effectiveness of cinnarizine by increasing accumulation of this drug in the cell membrane or at intracellular sites whereas the reduced effectiveness of verapamil and diltiazem is secondary to a change {{in the state of the}} Ca 2 + channel...|$|E
40|$|Addiction is a chronic, {{relapsing}} disorder {{for which}} strikingly few effective therapies exist, {{and there are}} no FDA-approved pharmacotherapies for methamphetamine (Meth) addition. There is an immense need to identify the neurobiological underpinnings of psychostimulant addiction and develop efficacious drug therapies to compliment the current mainstay treatment of behavioral/cognitive therapy. Re-exposure to cues associated with psychostimulants (e. g., drug paraphernalia) increase neuronal activity and can elicit drug-craving and -seeking; an effect which is profound and long-lasting. A mechanism to disrupt those brain processes which are necessary to maintain the association may reduce the incidence of cue-elicited relapse. Conditioned place preference (CPP) is a behavioral paradigm in which subjects (humans and rodents) learn to associate the rewarding properties of Meth with particular contextual cues. After the association develops subjects will choose to spend more time in the drug-associated context over a non-drug paired context. This behavior is thought to reflect the increased salience attributed to drug-associated cues. Thus, CPP is a valuable research tool to evaluate the neuronal adaptations associated with drug-induced associative learning and provides a means to evaluate the utility of potential pharmacotherapies to reduce the salience of drug-associated cues. As the major inhibitory neurotransmitter in the brain, GABA neurotransmission influences a number of drug-induced behaviors (e. g., CPP) as well as mnemonic processes (e. g., learning and memory). Accordingly, the metabotropic GABAB receptor has recently emerged as a potential therapeutic target for drug addiction. Administration of the direct acting GABAB receptor agonist baclofen has revealed positive outcomes in clinical trials; however, the side effects associated with baclofen limit its clinical utility. Positive allosteric modulators (PAMs) of the GABAB receptor augment GABAB receptor signaling without the side effects of the agonist making it a better alternative to agonist therapy. The current project sought to determine the role of the GABAB receptor in the maintenance of Meth-induced CPP. To do so, the GABAB receptor agonist baclofen and GABAB receptor positive allosteric modulators <b>fendiline,</b> GS 39783, and CGP 7930 were administered after the learned association developed (Meth-induced CPP) in order to determine if augmenting GABAB receptor signaling would disrupt the maintenance of the behavior. These experiments will shed light on the role of GABAB receptors in the maintenance of Meth-induced associative learning and evaluate the utility of GABAB receptor activators to reduce the salience of psychostimulant-associated cues...|$|E
