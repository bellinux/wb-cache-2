5|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) is {{a gasoline}} additive used to replace lead compounds for unleaded gasolines {{to improve the}} octane rating of low octane petroleum distillates. It reduces engine knock agent through {{the action of the}} carbonyl groups. Fuels containing manganese tend to form manganese carbides, which damage <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> The need for lead or manganese additives is merely historic because the modern reformation processes create fuels with increased octane ratings. Such fuels, directly or in mixture with non-reformed distillates, are universal in developed countries (0EU, Japan, etc.). In the USA, the imperative to provide the lowest price per volume on motor fuels and the lowest taxation rate, combined with lax legislation of fuel content before the year 2000, encouraged refineries to use MMT. Compared to 1953, levels of manganese in air have dropped. Many racing competitions specifically ban manganese compounds in racing fuel for carts and minibikes. MMT contains 24.4–25.2% manganese. Elevated atmospheric manganese concentrations are strongly correlated with automobile traffic density.|$|E
25|$|Wet {{breathing}}: Wet {{breathing is}} caused by water getting into the regulator and compromising breathing comfort and safety. Water can leak into the second stage body through damaged soft parts like torn mouthpieces, damaged <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and perforated diaphragms, through cracked housings, or through poorly sealing or fouled <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b>|$|E

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Furthermore, the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases. The experimental results obtained from the presen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing under different preload force, the deformation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> seal well. The sealing and deformation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component meets the desgin requirement...|$|R
50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{mechanical}} and thermal stresses {{that arise in}} the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> due to its operating with and without thermal coating layer (ceramic) on face <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b> Three dimensional models of an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> four cylinders, four stroke, and direct injection diesel engine have been presented. The governing equations were discretized using a finite-volume method (FVM) and solved using multi-physics COMSOL package Version 5.

25|$|The exhaust {{manifold}} (exhaust tee, exhaust cover, whiskers) is the ducting {{that protects the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve(s)</b> and diverts the exhaled air to the sides {{so that it does}} not bubble up in the diver's face and obscure the view. This is not necessary for twin hose regulators as they exhaust air behind the shoulders.|$|E
25|$|Lead Replacement Petrol (LRP) was {{developed}} for vehicles designed to run on leaded fuel and incompatible with unleaded. Rather than tetraethyl lead it contains other metal such as potassium compounds or methylcyclopentadienyl manganese tricarbonyl (MMT); these are purported to buffer soft <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and seats {{so that they do}} not suffer recession due to the use of unleaded fuel.|$|E
25|$|<b>Exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are {{necessary}} to prevent the diver inhaling water, and to allow a negative pressure difference to be induced over the diaphragm to control the demand valve. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> should operate at a very small pressure difference, and cause as little resistance to flow as reasonably possible, without being cumbersome and bulky. Elastomer mushroom valves serve the purpose adequately, though duckbill valves were also common in twin-hose regulators. Where {{it is important to}} avoid leaks back into the regulator, such as when diving in contaminated water, a system of two sets of valves in series can reduce the risk of contamination. A more complex option which can be used for surface supplied helmets, is to use a reclaim exhaust system which uses a separate flow regulator to control the exhaust which is returned to the surface in a dedicated hose in the umbilical.|$|E

5000|$|Exhaust: {{also known}} as outlet. During the exhaust stroke, the piston once again returns from B.D.C. to T.D.C. while the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is open. This action expels the spent air-fuel mixture through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{opens at}} point 1. As the piston moves from BDC (point 1) to TDC (point 0) with the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opened, the gaseous mixture is vented to the {{atmosphere}} and the process starts anew.|$|R
25|$|Similar to the {{improved}} BMW VIb, a version with a strengthened crankshaft nose, a modified crankshaft end, new valve seats, and smaller <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> was developed. This was {{designated as the}} M-17B and it entered production in June 1931. It also was built in two versions with different compression ratios. It could be converted to M-17F standards by exchanging some parts.|$|E
25|$|Many interwar {{developments}} were to aircraft engines, which {{benefited from}} the vast improvements being made for the growing car industry. Although not strictly an 'aerospace' innovation, the use of refractory alloys like Stellite and Brightray for the hard-facing of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> offered huge gains in the reliability of aircraft engines. This itself encouraged long-range commercial flights, as the new engines were reliable enough to be considered safe for long flights across oceans or mountain ranges.|$|E
25|$|The {{design was}} frozen again in January, 1974. A {{stainless}} steel header was specified, to increase power between 2,000rpm {{up and the}} 7,000rpm redline. Camshaft lift and duration were eased back and the torque curve reshaped to a street-oriented peak of 5,200rpm. Project coordinator William Large built two cars for durability testing. By April 1974, the engines ran “clean” for , after which hydrocarbon curves on the first car rose far {{in excess of the}} permitted , owing to burned <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> For certification, five months’ durability miles would have to be reaccumulated.|$|E
40|$|Purpose: The {{determination}} of the temperature distribution, temperature gradients and thermal stresses in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> with using the layer of the carbon deposit in initial phase {{of the work of}} turbocharged Diesel engine. Design/methodology/approach: The results of calculations of the temperature distribution, temperature gradients and thermal stresses in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> of turbocharged Diesel engine with using the layer of the carbon deposit on the different surfaces of the valve were received by means of the two – zone combustion model and the finite element method. Findings: The computations presented the possibility of use of the geometrical models of the layer of carbon deposit on the different surfaces of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and heat transfer on individual surfaces of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> used by the variable values of the boundary conditions and temperature of working medium in initial time of the working engine. Research limitations/implications: The modelling of thermal loads were carried out by analysing the temperature distribution, temperature gradients and thermal stresses in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> in initial phase of the work of turbocharged Diesel engine.

At one time, the FWMV's <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size (1.37") exceeded the inlet valve size (1.35") on the most successful Mk.4 version.|$|R
5000|$|Exhaust: The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{remains open}} while the piston moves upward {{expelling}} the combustion gases. For naturally aspirated engines {{a small part}} of the combustion gases may remain in the cylinder during normal operation because the piston does not close the combustion chamber completely; these gases dissolve in the next charge. At the end of this stroke, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closes, the intake valve opens, and the sequence repeats in the next cycle. The intake valve may open before the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closes to allow better scavenging.|$|R
25|$|Dry suits pose {{their own}} unique {{problems}} compared to wet suit diving, due to the complex construction and since a diver needs to constantly manage and adjust the air volume inside the suit. During descent, air must be added to maintain constant volume. This prevents suit squeeze, loss of neutral buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled descent. During ascent, the air added at depth must be removed again, {{in order to prevent}} over-inflation, excessive buoyancy, and potential uncontrolled ascent. Most modern dry suits are equipped with adjustable spring-loaded automatic <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves,</b> which can assist with this problem when properly set.|$|E
25|$|With {{high-performance}} camshaft timing, <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> {{in different}} cylinders can be {{open at the}} same time, overlapping {{at the end of}} the power stroke in one cylinder and the end of exhaust stroke in another. In twin-scroll designs, the exhaust manifold physically separates the channels for cylinders that can interfere with each other, so that the pulsating exhaust gasses flow through separate spirals (scrolls). With common firing order 1-3-4-2, two scrolls of unequal length pair cylinders 1-4 and 3-2. This lets the engine efficiently use exhaust scavenging techniques, which decreases exhaust gas temperatures and NOx emissions, improves turbine efficiency, and reduces turbo lag evident at low engine speeds.|$|E
25|$|The {{progenitor}} for the ASh-73 was the M-70. It {{was tested}} in late 1938 {{and was a}} failure because of cracks in the master connecting rod and the geared centrifugal supercharger's impeller. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> also burnt through. The M-71 of 1939 was the successor to the M-70 and it too was not a success. It used some components from the M-62 engine, but its development was slowed by the German attack on the Soviet Union in 1941. It passed its State acceptance tests {{in the autumn of}} 1942, but was not placed into production as there was not any production capacity available, although it was tested on a number of different prototypes during the war. The M-72 of early 1945 was a boosted version of the M-71 and was superseded by the ASh-73 before production could get underway.|$|E

25|$|The boat then {{proceeded}} to its patrol area {{off the coast of}} Freetown, Sierra Leone, traversing a track between Grand Canaria and Fuerteventura in the Canary Islands. On 8 December they encountered a neutral Spanish tanker, the Zorroza, which Bruns allowed to continue on its way. By 11 December, without having encountered any Allied ships, the crew had managed to repair the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> and after reporting this to BdU, Bruns received orders to proceed to the Cape Verde Islands, where no U-boat had previously been sent. The submarine arrived there on 12 December before moving on to a point west of Dakar. For the next month, U-175 patrolled the waters off the west coast of Africa as BdU attempted to move them into position to attack ships in the area. Staying underwater during the day, and sailing on the surface at night, they spotted a number of neutral vessels during this time, but left them alone. They were attacked once by an Allied aircraft on New Years Day; again very little damage was caused.|$|E
25|$|Most {{internal}} combustion engines use a split collet to hold both the inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> under constant valve spring pressure which returns the valves to their closed position when the camshaft lobes {{are not in}} contact with the top of the valves. The two collet halves have an internal raised rib which locate into a circular groove near the top of each valve stem, the outer side of the collet halves are a taper fit into the spring retainer (also known as a collar), this taper locks the retainer in place and the raised rib that sits in the circular groove on the valve stem also locks the collet halves in place to the valve stem. To remove the valves from a cylinder head a 'valve spring compressor' is used to compress the valve springs by exerting force on the spring retainer which allows the collets to be removed, when the compressor is removed, the retainer, spring and valve can then be removed from the cylinder head. It may be realized that the retainer does not budge when the valve spring compressor is used, this is due to a buildup of carbon which over time has locked the retainer and collets slightly. A slight sharp tap on the backside of the valve spring compressor above the valve stem should free the retainer allowing the springs to be compressed whilst retrieving the split collet. On reassembly it is difficult to keep the split collets in place whilst the compressor is released, by applying a small amount of grease to the internal side of the split collets will keep them in place on the valve stem whilst releasing the compressor, then as the spring retainer rises it locks the tapered split collets in place.|$|E
25|$|Land Rover's global sales {{collapsed}} {{during the}} early 1980s. This was mainly due to foreign competition offering larger, more powerful, more comfortable vehicles. Land Rover suffered from poor build quality and materials during the 1970s and by 1983 the then-current Series III model was distinctly outdated, despite recent improvements. Land Rover decided to focus the sales of its Ninety/One Ten/127 range on the UK and Europe, for which it required a diesel engine with significantly better performance than the 68-horsepower 2.5-litre type then in production. Project Falcon was started in 1984 to develop a turbocharged version of this engine. The resulting engine was Land Rover's first production turbodiesel and their first engine {{to be given a}} marketing name- the Diesel Turbo, a name given to differentiate it from the VM Motori-built turbodiesel then being used in the Range Rover, which was sold as the 'Turbo D'. The Diesel Turbo, although essentially the same as the 2.5-litre diesel, had numerous additions and modifications to allow it to cope with the stresses of turbocharging. New pistons with Teflon-coated crowns and Nimonic steel <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> were used to withstand higher combustion temperatures. The crankshaft was cross-drilled for improved strength and cooling. The block was modified to allow an oil feed/drain system to the turbocharger, and the cooling system was improved with an 8-bladed viscous fan and integral oil cooler. The engine was fitted with a high-capacity breather system to cope with the greater volumes of gas flow through the engine. Despite the inherent age of the design, it performed well in tests against its rivals and provided the vital blend of performance and economy the Land Rover had needed for many years. It was the first diesel model to match the petrol engine's 4-ton towing limit and the first to be able to exceed the UK national speed limit of 70mph (112km/h). However, early engines suffered several failures. Most serious were failed main and big-end bearings and splits or cracks in the block. In 1988 a new block and an improved design of bearing and bearing cap was fitted which solved these issues. The engine's higher internal temperatures meant that the cooling system also had to be maintained to a much higher standard than the earlier engines. Further changes were made in 1989, this time to the breather system to prevent oil being drawn into the air filter. Despite these issues, the Diesel Turbo was a strong seller. It was the standard engine for the UK and European markets and Land Rover's sales increased after its introduction. Time has shown that these engines can turn in long service lives if maintained as required—like many early turbodiesels, a lack of maintenance causes failure.|$|E
