The sharp barbs penetrated with ease, but could not be pulled out. The bone tip is fastened to a length of braided twine meanwhile; the hunter held the other end of the twine in his hand.|$|E
5000|$|A few {{underwater}} {{sites in}} Florida have yielded Paleoindian artifacts of ivory, bone, antler, shell, and wood. A type of artifact found in rivers in northern Florida is the ivory <b>foreshaft.</b> One {{end of a}} <b>foreshaft</b> was attached to a projectile point with pitch and sinew. The other end was pointed, and pressure-fitted into a wood shaft. The foreshafts were made from mammoth ivory, or possibly, in some cases, from mastodon ivory. A shell [...] "trigger" [...] may be from an atlatl (spear-thrower). Other tools include an eyed needle made from bone, double pointed bone pins, part of a mortar carved from an oak log, and a non-returning boomerang or throwing stick made from oak.|$|E
50|$|The oldest {{indication}} for archery in Europe {{comes from}} Stellmoor in the Ahrensburg valley north of Hamburg, Germany. They {{were associated with}} artifacts of the late Paleolithic (11,000-9,000BP). The arrows were made of pine and consisted of a mainshaft and a 15-20 centimetre (6-8 inches) long <b>foreshaft</b> with a flint point. They had shallow grooves on the base, indicating that they were shot from a bow.|$|E
5000|$|Clovis {{points are}} {{characterized}} by concave longitudinal shallow grooves called [...] "flutes" [...] on both faces one third or more up from the base to the pointed tip; The grooves may have permitted the points to be fastened (hafted) to wooden spears, dart shafts or <b>foreshafts</b> (of wood, bone, etc.) {{that would have been}} socketed onto the tip end of a spear or dart. Clovis points could also have been hafted as knives whose handles also served as removable <b>foreshafts</b> of a spear or dart. (This hypothesis is partly based on analogy with aboriginal harpoons that had tethered <b>foreshafts</b> Cotter 1937). There are numerous examples of post-Clovis era points that were hafted to <b>foreshafts,</b> but there is no direct evidence that Clovis people used this type of technological system.|$|R

50|$|Specimens {{are known}} to have been made of flint, chert, jasper, {{chalcedony}} and other stone of conchoidal fracture. Ivory and bone atlatl hooks of Clovis age have been archaeologically recovered. Known bone and ivory tools associated with Clovis archaeological deposits are not considered effective <b>foreshafts</b> for projectile weapons. The idea of Clovis <b>foreshafts</b> is commonly repeated in the technical literature despite the paucity of archaeological evidence. The assembled multiple piece spear or dart could have been thrown by hand or with the aid of an atlatl (spear thrower).|$|R
50|$|Harpoons {{were also}} called throwing-arrows when the pointed head fit loosely into the socket of the <b>foreshaft</b> {{and the head}} was able to detach from the harpoon when it {{penetrated}} an animal, and remain in the wound. There were three main kinds of harpoon that the Aleut’s used: a simple harpoon, with a head that kept its original position in the animal after striking, a compound (toggle-head) harpoon in which the head took a horizontal position in the animal after penetration, and the throwing-lance used to kill large animals.|$|E
50|$|The Salukat is a quiver {{made of a}} long {{segment of}} bamboo with a {{partition}} at the lower part and a long sharp protrusion at the tip. The arrow used are not fletched. In some cases the nock was provided by whipping two slivers of wood {{on opposite sides of}} the tail end of the shaft in such a way that they projected a short distance beyond it. The Mentawai people generally put poison on the tips of their arrows, using a mixture of omai (Antiaris toxicaria), lombok (Capsicum annisum), tuba (Derris elliptica) and baglai (Alpinia galanga). The arrow is known as logui and the anterior section of the <b>foreshaft</b> alone as bakulu.|$|E
5000|$|The darts in {{question}} are {{much larger than}} arrows, but noticeably lighter than javelins. They have a weighted point, often of stone, on a removable <b>foreshaft.</b> This is held by friction onto a thin, flexible main shaft a few metres in length, with fletching and a (usually socket-like) nock at the opposite end. Since they are unlike anything in Western history, the term [...] "dart" [...] has been adopted after some debate. Some alternate terms for this missile have included the spear, but this term has fallen out of favour since in all other uses, spears are stiff enough {{to be used for}} stabbing. In its function, an atlatl dart is more like a combination between a bow and an arrow.|$|E
40|$|Experimental flintknappers {{have shown}} that it was {{possible}} for prehistoric hunters to repair basally damaged dart points by retouching the base to a different shape. Because dart points were highly curated tools and often manufactured of non-local, high utility toolstones, the lack of evidence in the archaeological record for basal retouch of one type into another is perplexing. We develop and test a hypothesis for the resistance of retouched bases to typological change, using a set of projectile point assemblages from northeastern Nevada. It is possible that the necessity of refitting repaired points to a limited supply of pre-prepared dart <b>foreshafts</b> constrained the retouch of broken points. If repair of a broken point required a hunter to modify its hafting element beyond limits feasible for reattaching it onto the <b>foreshafts</b> in hand, it was more economical for the hunter to simply replace the broken point. If so, such constraints to haft repair have implications for understanding why dart point base styles are spatially and temporally patterned...|$|R

The trunk was made into wooden mortars and the smaller branches were used for bow making. Sometimes arrow <b>foreshafts</b> were of mesquite wood. Mesquite made excellent firewood for cooking, baking pottery, and warmth and mesquite bark was good for kindling. Large branches were used for construction such as posts for houses and rafters.

Most of the {{finished}} artifacts {{were related to the}} hunt, while the digging sticks represented the gathering aspect of the economy. A small variety of gaming pieces could infer leisure time or perhaps a nonsecular side of the culture. Fragments of atlatl darts and throwing boards represented the use of atlatl. There was no firm evidence for feathering of mainshafts of the darts, which consisted of a shallow cup in the proximal end to engage the pointed spur on the distal end. The mainshaft specimens collected were too fragmentary to estimate the length. the throwing boards were also too fragmentary to establish a good estimate of their size or form. The arrows collected were represented by a compound type with a reed mainshaft and a wooden <b>foreshaft.</b> Dalley concluded that the compound arrow was the most common type found in the cave. A striking change from using atlatl to bow and arrow could be seen when comparing the strata. From strata 1 through 8 there were only atlatl and dart items, whereas strata 12 to 16 contained only bow and arrow items. Strata 9 and 10 contained a mixture of both weapons and there were no occurrences of either type in strata 11. However, Dalley identified two weaknesses in the interpretation. First, a stratum rather than an artifact was dated and secondly, the inferences were based on few and fragmentary artifacts which some of them had a lack of distinctive characteristics.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} the harpoon heads excavated from the Moyoro Shell Mound, a famous archaeological {{site of the}} Okhotsk culture in Abashiri City, Hokkaido Prefecture. The site {{is located on the}} left bank of the Abashiri River, which flows into the Okhotsk Sea (Fig. 1). Archaeological finds from the Moyoro Shell Mound, which were excavated from the Pit-dwelling No. 10 in 1948 (Komai ed. 1964), are preserved by the Department of Archaeology, Faculty of Letters, the University of Tokyo. In this paper, harpoon heads made of bone and antlers in this collection will be described and discussed. In addition, some harpoon heads {{in the collection of the}} Hakodate City Museum will also be discussed; these specimens were unearthed from the Moyoro Shell Mound in 1941 and 1942. From the Pit-dwelling No. 10, 23 harpoon heads were excavated (Fig. 2 - 5, PL. 1 - 4). They are classified by the way they are hafted and connected to the line. While only one male harpoon head was found from the floor of the dwelling, 22 female harpoon heads were unearthed from the floor and upper layers, including five unfinished specimens. The female-toggle harpoon heads are subdivided into four types. Type I is an open socket harpoon head, with a line groove also used for lashing the shaft or the <b>foreshaft.</b> Type II is an open socket harpoon head with two line holes to hold the harpoon head and a groove for lashing the shaft or the <b>foreshaft.</b> Type III is a closed socket harpoon head with a thin body. Type IV is an open socket harpoon head with two line holes, which belongs to the Ainu period. The number of harpoon heads of each type found from each layer is shown in Table 2. Type I harpoon heads constitute a large proportion of the unearthed harpoon heads, while only one specimen for each of Type II, Type III, and Type IV was found from the topsoil. Some of the Type I harpoon heads show the traces of reprocessing (Fig. 6). The reduction process of this type of harpoon heads was reconstructed based on these materials (Fig. 7). The Type II harpoon heads in eastern Hokkaido, distributed from Tokoro to Nemuro, are typologically different from the Type II harpoon heads in Southern Kuriles (Fig. 8). Some of the Type III harpoon heads are made of the ribs of sea mammals; this technique is characteristic of this site (Fig. 9) ...|$|E
40|$|In {{the first}} half of the Epi-Jomon period, a great variety of harpoonheads were used in Hokkaido. They were often {{decorated}} and buried in graves. This article tries to establish their classification and chronological sequence and consider their genealogy. Harpoonheads are classified by the way they are hafted, and the resistance they generate in the body of the target. These two points have often been confused, but they should be treated separately. When classifying according to resistance, harpoonheads are usually classified into barbed harpoonheads and toggle harpoonheads. The criteria for this classification have been unclear, but in this article harpoonheads meeting the following criteria are classified as toggle harpoonheads: 1. The tension of the line and the resistance the harpoonhead meet in the target produce a moment of force which rotates the harpoonhead. 2. Spurs or barbs are located in the rear of the line hole or the line groove. Epi-Jomon harpoonheads are classified into five categories: No. 1, male-barbed; No. 2, female-closed socket-barbed; No. 3, female-closed socket-toggle; No. 4, female-open socket-toggle (line also used for lashing the shaft or the foreshaft); No. 5, female-open socket-toggle (line not used for lashing the shaft or the <b>foreshaft)</b> (Table 1). This article examines harpoonheads found in 26 Epi-Jomon sites (Fig. 6, Table 2). No. 4 harpoonheads are the traditional form common in prehistoric Hokkaido. No. 5 harpoonheads are rare and exceptional in the Epi-Jomon period. This article discusses mainly No. 1 -No. 3 harpoonheads, which existed in large numbers in the Epi-Jomon period, particularly in {{the first half}}, but did not exist in the preceding Jomon period or the succeeding Satsumon period. A chronological sequence was established by using a great variety of No. 3 specimens from southern Hokkaido, especially the sites around the Funka-wan Bay. They are classified into Group A (Fig. 8) and Group B (Fig. 9, 10) by the shapes of the cross sections of their bodies, and the latter are subdivided into four groups (B 0 [...] -B 3) by the shapes and positions of their line holes. Using the available stratifical data, three stages are provisionally established: Minami-Usu 6 site strata VI stage, Usumoshiri site shell midden stage, and Usumoshiri site grave No. 4 stage (Fig. 11). They correspond to Group A, Groups B 0 /B 1, and Groups B 2 /B 3. These stages belong to the second half of the Esan culture, which is almost equivalent to {{the first half of}} the Epi-Jomon period in southern Hokkaido. This writer agrees with the widely-held view that No. 3 harpoonheads originated from the Tohoku region. No. 1 harpoonheads (Fig. 15 - 17) were already widespread in the beginning of the Epi-Jomon period and can be found at Usumoshiri site grave No. 4 stage. They are generally considered to be of Tohoku origin but the possibility that they originated north of Hokkaido cannot be denied. No. 2 harpoonheads are unique to the Esan culture. There are no harpoonheads resembling them in the neighboring region, and the genealogy of these harpoonheads has been much discussed. They are classified into Group A with sharp points (Fig. 18 - 20, Fig. 21 - 5 [...] 10, Fig. 22 - 6 [...] - 9) and Group B with spoon-like heads for putting on end blades (Fig. 21 - 1 [...] 4, Fig. 22 - 1 [...] - 5, Fig. 23). Group A appeared in Minami-Usu 6 site strata VI stage, while Group B appeared in Usumoshiri site grave No. 4 stage. This article concludes that, with regard to No. 2 harpoonheads, Group A evolved under the influence of No. 1 harpoonheads (barbed) and No. 3 harpoonheads (closed socket) during the Esan culture, to be later followed by Group B...|$|E

Projectile weapon elements {{are found in}} many forms in prehistoric sites, {{at least from the}} beginning of the Upper Palaeolithic. These artefacts first attract archaeologists with their great numbers, often dominating proportions in tool assemblages, but they are also interesting due to their clearly dynamic role in prehistoric material culture: the morphology and/or technical characteristics of many of them vary significantly through time and space, thus constituting a useful tool for archaeologists in the construction of chronologies and the definition of cultures. Researchers often integrate these variations with other types of transformations—such as ecological or economic ones—to build interpretative models of the evolution of societies. The important role of projectile weapon elements in archaeological research is also due to their association with activities that are never mundane: hunting activities, of course, but also, very likely, in the context of conflicts between individuals or groups. Wild animals are a vital resource for most hunter-gatherer groups and they continue to play a significant economic and/or socio-cultural role in many agro-pastoral societies.

Bows are made from palm wood (Astrocaryum jauri.) and are long (~2 m) as are most South American native bows. Bowstrings are made from a semi-cultivated bromiliad fiber (Ananas lucidus). Arrows, (also ~2m long) are made from domesticated arrowcanes, wooden <b>foreshafts,</b> fletched with anhinga feathers, and constructed with bromiliad fiber and a manufactured tree resin (Symphonia glubulifera).

Bone is reported to have been used before metal was as common, and two wooden-tipped bird arrows are still occasionally employed. Some River Pumé men have access to guns for hunting. Because most hunted foods in the savannas are burrowing game (armadillos, tegu lizards, and small ameiva lizards), machetes and especially bows often are used as digging implements to capture these game. During the dry season, small rafts made from moriche plalm leaf stems are used to search for caimans and turtles in seasonal lagoons. River Pumé use dugout canoes for fishing, pursuit of caimans, and turtles in the major drainages of the llanos, as well as for transportation.|$|R
