5000|$|Thus {{there is}} an {{infinite}} list of English phrases (such that each phrase is of finite length, but lengths vary in the list) that define real numbers unambiguously. We first arrange this list of phrases by increasing length, then order all phrases of equal length lexicographically (in dictionary order), so that the ordering is canonical. This yields an infinite list of the corresponding real numbers: r1, r2, ... Now define a new real number r as follows. The integer part of r is 0, the nth <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> of r is 1 if the nth <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> of rn is not 1, and the nth <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> of r is 2 if the nth <b>decimal</b> <b>place</b> of rn is 1.|$|R

25|$|Where many {{calculations}} {{are done}} in sequence, the choice of rounding method can have a very {{significant effect on the}} result.

It was initially set at 1000.000 (three <b>decimal</b> <b>places</b> of accuracy), and after 22 months had fallen to about 520 — whereas stock prices had generally increased in the period. The problem was caused by the index being recalculated thousands of times daily, and always being rounded down to 3 <b>decimal</b> <b>places,</b> {{in such a way that}} the rounding errors accumulated.
