There we saluted the king according to the custom of the country, falling upon our knees and thrice kissing the ground. That prince is nineteen years of age, black, but well shap'd and of a majestick presence; not having thick lips nor flat nose, {{like the rest of}} his subjects. He was seated upon a rich bed under a canopy, with his legs across, after the oriental fashion; and round him twenty old men, seated after the same manner, but somewhat lower. He was cloath'd with a long vest of silk, embroider'd with gold, and girt with a kind of scarf made of <b>fine</b> <b>calico.</b> He had a white turban on his head. The old men were clad much after the same manner.|$|E

We were of several nations, among whom were five Scotch merchants, inhabiting in Moscow, and well experienced in trade.|$|R
60|$|It was the {{beginning}} of February, new style, when we set out from Pekin. My partner and the old pilot had gone express back to the port where we had first put in, to dispose of some goods which we had left there; and I, with a Chinese merchant whom I had some knowledge of at Nankin, and who came to Pekin on his own affairs, went to Nankin, where I bought ninety pieces of fine damasks, with about two hundred pieces of other very fine silk of several sorts, some mixed with gold, and had all these brought to Pekin against my partner's return. Besides this, we bought a large quantity of raw silk, and some other goods, our cargo amounting, in these goods only, to about three thousand five hundred pounds sterling; which, together with tea and some <b>fine</b> <b>calicoes,</b> and three camels' loads of nutmegs and cloves, loaded in all eighteen camels for our share, besides those we rode upon; these, with two or three spare horses, and two horses loaded with provisions, made together twenty-six camels and horses in our retinue.|$|R

2500|$|In {{the second}} part of the dictionary, the copied Russian headwords are often {{accompanied}} by their Serbian equivalents; e.g., under the headword очки (glasses), [...] "очки, наочари, die Augengläser". In entries of the first part, Russian and Serbian forms complement each other; so the headword schwarz (black) is translated with the Russian черный, and in that entry, the verb schwärzen (blacken) is translated with the Serbian поцрнити. German proverbs and sayings are interpreted with their Serbian counterparts. Thus, s.v. Schnitt, a German phrase meaning [...] "he made a good profit from it" [...] is interpreted with a popular Serbian saying, pala mu sekira u med (his axe fell into honey). Phonologically, morphologically, and lexically, vernacular Serbian used in the Avramović Dictionary reflects a dialect of the Serbs of Vojvodina. It also exhibits some archaic grammatical traits, and the usage of aorist is more common than in modern Serbian. The everyday language of the Vojvodina Serbs was enriched in the 18th century with loanwords from German. Some of those found in the dictionary are also part of modern literary Serbian, such as торта (torta, torte), харинга (haringa, herring), шупа (šupa, shed), паръ (par, pair), нула (nula, zero), цицъ (cic, <b>fine</b> printed <b>calico),</b> and баïонетъ (bajonet, bayonet).|$|R
