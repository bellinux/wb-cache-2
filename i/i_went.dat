5|$|C'est trop bête d'en parler (It's {{too stupid}} to talk about). There was a break. Coppi {{attacked}}. His brother Fausto gave him a push to get him away. He wanted his brother to win. I waited a bit and then I attacked and I caught him and the break. Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> off by myself. I {{was going to win}} Paris–Roubaix. At the entrance to the vélodrome, there were crowds everywhere, blocking the way. I looked around for where to go and I was directed round the outside wall of the track, to where the team cars had to park. It wasn't like nowadays, when there's television and everything. Then it was more chaotic and the whole road was blocked. People said I should have known the way into the track. But how do you know a thing like {{that at the end of}} Paris–Roubaix, when you've raced all day over roads like that? A gendarme signalled the way to go and that's the way <b>I</b> <b>went.</b>|$|E
5|$|Despite the poem's {{doubt and}} darkness, {{a note of}} hope is struck by {{the first line of}} the fifth section, 'So here I am in the middle way'. This refers to the first line of Dante's Inferno, 'Midway in our life's journey, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> astray'. Although the descent is {{predicated}} on going astray, so also is persevering beyond it into the light.|$|E
5|$|I heard {{dance and}} techno {{and was always}} {{interested}} in it but didn't really know where to go. But <b>I</b> <b>went</b> to a club one night and saw that people were losing their mind to these dance tracks. It wasn't really that I wanted to mimic that sound. I just wanted to have that energy and have people going crazy. So I knew the fusion was putting R with trance.|$|E

5|$|In , a 2010 {{documentary}} film narrated by Dustin Hoffman, Youkilis noted: It's something that I probably won’t realize until my career is over, {{how many people}} are really rooting for me and cheering for me. And it's not just because <b>I</b> <b>went</b> 3-for-4, or had a great game. It's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people {{and a lot of the}} Jewish heritage, and the struggles that a lot of our people have had.|$|E
5|$|So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> out and saw {{the band}} – Billy, James, and D'arcy – playing at Avalon with a drum machine. Man, did they sound horrible! They were atrocious. But the thing I noticed was that {{not only were the}} song {{structures}} good, but Billy's voice had a lot of drive to it, like he was dying to succeed. So I ended up driving from work every Wednesday to rehearse with them.|$|E
5|$|I never {{warmed up}} ten, fifteen minutes {{before a game}} like most {{pitchers}} do. I'd loosen up, three, four minutes. Five at the outside. And I never went to the bullpen. Oh, I'd relieve all right, plenty of times, but <b>I</b> <b>went</b> right from the bench to the box, and I'd take a few warm-up pitches and be ready. Then I had good control. I aimed to make the batter hit the ball, and I threw as few pitches as possible. That's why I was able to work every other day.|$|E

5|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> to Iraq {{because what}} I saw when I {{was over there}} was soldiers—young kids for the most part—helping people in Iraq; helping getting the power turned back on, helping get {{hospitals}} open, helping get the water turned back on and you don't hear any of that on the news. You hear, 'X number of people were killed today,' which I think does a huge disservice. It's like spitting on these {{young men and women}} who are over there fighting to help this country.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> to New York {{and we were}} in {{the studio}} and came to a break. I was sitting at the piano and told Mariah about this movie. Within two hours, we had this {{incredible}} seed for this song, 'Hero'. It was never meant for Mariah to sing. In her mind, we were writing a song for Gloria Estefan for this movie. And we went into an area that Mariah didn't really go into-in her words, {{it was a little bit}} too schmaltzy or too ballady or too old-fashioned as far as melody and lyrics.|$|E
5|$|If it {{had gone}} by me, it's a two-on-one. So I got a little lucky there, but Derek gave me a great pass and when I got the pass I was moving across. As I skated across, Glenn had to move across the crease and had to open his pads a little. I was really {{trying to get the}} puck on net, and I did. As <b>I</b> <b>went</b> across, Glenn's legs opened. I looked back, and I saw it go in, so I jumped.|$|E

I consider that <b>I</b> <b>went</b> through all stages, from popcorn to dance, club and pop music, so I considered that I have reached a maturity which allows me to release a song which I like, which makes me move in a club and makes me want to hear it on the radio, and I'm very fulfilled.|$|E

5|$|September 3rd – <b>I</b> <b>went</b> and saw {{the whole}} south part of the City burning from Cheapeside to the Thames, and... was now taking hold of St. Paule's Church, to which the {{scaffolds}} contributed exceedingly.September 7th – <b>I</b> <b>went</b> this morning on foote from White-hall as far as London Bridge, thro' the late Fleete-streete, Ludgate Hill, by St. Paules... At my returne I was infinitely concern'd to find that goodly Church St. Paules now a sad ruine, and that beautiful portico... now rent in pieces, flakes of vast stone split asunder, and nothing now remaining intire but the inscription in the architrave, shewing by whom it was built, which had not one letter of it defac'd. It was astonishing to see what immense stones the heate had in a manner calcin'd, {{so that all the}} ornaments, columns, freezes, capitals, and projectures of massie Portland-stone flew off, even to the very roofe, where a sheet of lead covering a great space (no less than six akers by measure) was totally mealted; the ruines of the vaulted roofe falling broke into St. Faith's, which being fill'd with the magazines of bookes belonging to the Stationers, and carried thither for safety, they were all consum'd, burning for a weeke following. It is also observable that the lead over the altar at the East end was untouch'd, and among the divers monuments, the body of one Bishop remain'd intire. Thus lay in ashes that most venerable Church, one of the most antient pieces of early piety in the Christian world.|$|E
