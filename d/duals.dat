5|$|Gleason is {{also the}} namesake of the Gleason polynomials, a system of polynomials that {{generate}} the weight enumerators of linear codes. These polynomials take a particularly simple form for self-dual codes: in this case there are just two of them, the two bivariate polynomials x2+y2 and x8+14x2y2+y8. Gleason's student Jessie MacWilliams continued Gleason's work in this area, proving {{a relationship between the}} weight enumerators of codes and their <b>duals</b> that has become known as the MacWilliams identity.|$|E
5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and <b>Duals</b> can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>dual</b> number {{indicates}} {{a pair of}} things. Historically, the <b>dual</b> number has been a full grammatical number, participating as the third element in [...] singular - <b>dual</b> - plural distinction. During the last century, the <b>dual</b> was used more or less sporadically in Lithuanian, sometimes reaching {{the status of a}} full number for agreement purposes, meaning the <b>dual</b> of noun required <b>dual</b> agreement in its adjectives or the <b>dual</b> of the subject required the <b>dual</b> of the verb. But in many more cases the <b>dual</b> was reduced to a nominal category explicitly indicating a pair of things, but not requiring <b>dual</b> agreement of adjectives or verbs. Presently, the <b>dual</b> is mostly used as a declension paradigm for numbers du – two, abu – both (and a variant abudu – idem) and with personal pronouns aš – I, mùdu <b>dual</b> – we two (mẽs pl. – we) and tu sg. – you, jùdu <b>dual</b> – you two (jū̃s pl. – you).|$|R

Using quadratic APN functions on GF(2 d+ 1), Yoshiara (2009) [10], constructed d-dimensional <b>dual</b> hyperovals in PG(2 d+ 1, 2). This construction enables us to investigate quadratic APN functions from the view point of <b>dual</b> hyperovals (Edel (2009) [4]). Yoshiara generalized this construction in Yoshiara (2008) [11]. Note that these Yoshiara’s <b>dual</b> hyperovals are quotients of Huybrechts’ <b>dual</b> hyperoval. In this note, using quadratic APN functions on GF(2 d), we construct d-dimensional <b>dual</b> hyperovals in PG(3 d, 2), which are quotients of Buratti–Del Fra’s <b>dual</b> hyperoval. Moreover, we prove that, if two of these <b>dual</b> hyperovals are isomorphic, then the corresponding quadratic APN functions are extended affine equivalent. We call these <b>dual</b> hyperovals Buratti–Del Fra type <b>dual</b> hyperovals. Then, if d is sufficiently large, there are many non-isomorphic d-dimensional Buratti–Del Fra type <b>dual</b> hyperovals in PG(3 d, 2) ...|$|R
