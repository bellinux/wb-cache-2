50|$|Robert Emmet Finnigan (born May 27, 1927) is an American {{pioneer in}} the {{development}} of gas chromatography-mass spectrometry equipment (GC/MS). Finnigan founded the Scientific Instruments Division of Electronic Associates, Inc., producing the first commercial quadrupole mass spectrometer in 1964. He then formed Finnigan Instruments Corporation to combine a computer system with a quadrupole mass spectrometer and gas chromatograph. Finnigan's GC/MS/computer systems are used to detect and identify trace organic compounds, making them important instruments for the monitoring and protection of the environment. They were adopted by the United States Environmental Protection Agency as a standard <b>instrument</b> <b>for</b> <b>monitoring</b> water quality and were fundamental to the work of the EPA.|$|E
