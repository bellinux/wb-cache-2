Furthermore, it is required to fulfill certain rescue mission, e. g., navigate victims to exit through safe path in case of <b>emergency.</b> <b>Current</b> monitor and rescue approaches generally rely on either teleoperated robots, or teams of wireless robots. Typically the robots used in these systems tend to have high cost which make them unpractical in large scale deployment and applications. In this work, we present a realtime monitor and rescue system, TELOSW-BOT NET, utilizing integrated networks. The integrated network is an integration of stationary sensor networks and robots: static sensor networks comprised of large numbers of small, simple, and inexpensive wireless sensors, and the robots which can communicate and controlled by sensor nodes. We demonstrate the efficacy of our system in real test bed composed of 46 sensors, {{which is one of the}} largest robotic sensor network to our knowledge, providing empirical results.

30|$|The {{respondents}} {{appreciated the}} significance of direct communication of risk information by the regulatory agency, especially in case of <b>emergency.</b> <b>Current</b> Japanese regulatory advisories, including revision of label information, issuance of DHCP letters, and other safety notifications often require intensive and sometimes contentious preliminary discussion, followed by tough negotiation before agreement between the regulatory authority and pharmaceutical company is reached. These likely represent the most resource-consuming tasks on both sides. The risk communication measures implemented by drug companies under the strict oversight of the regulatory agency may therefore take considerable time until the dispatch of key risk messages can proceed, which might in turn impair the timeliness of risk mitigation actions, and also compromise the effectiveness and transparency of communications. Indeed, in July 2011, coincidentally after the close of this survey, the PMDA launched a new website “On information concerning the risks of drugs under evaluation” within its “Pharmaceuticals and Medical Devices Information Homepage”, similar to the Drug Safety Communication by the US FDA (Pharmaceuticals and Food Safety Bureau 2011 b; Seligman and Osborne 2009). Further effective utilization of direct and rapid communication by the regulatory agency is desirable.|$|E
40|$|Epistaxis {{remains a}} common ENT <b>emergency.</b> <b>Current</b> {{evidence}} varies {{on whether a}} seasonal variation exists with the incidence of epistaxis. This review of epistaxis admissions in East Kent aimed to ascertain if indeed any relationship exists between epistaxis and any particular seasons or temperature. Methods: This was a retrospective review of all epistaxis admissions in the East Kent Hospitals NHS Trust (covering Ashford, Canterbury, Margate and surrounding Thanet) over a 5 year period: 2005 – 2009 inclusive. A total of 1, 102 patients with epistaxis severe enough to require hospital admission {{were included in the}} study. The number of admissions were divided into the seasons: Winter (December – February), Spring (March – May), Summer (June – August) and Autumn (September – November). Epistaxis frequencies per year were also correlated with data on minimum and average monthly temperatures for the region supplied by the Meteorological Office UK. Results: Epistaxis admissions were highest in winter and lowest in summer. Winter 320 (29. 04 %), Spring 311 (28. 22 %), Summer 217 (19. 69 %) & Autumn 254 (23. 05 %). The parametric one way ANOVA and non-parametric Kruskal-Wallis tests demonstrated a statistically significant correlation between the seasons and epistaxis admissions; p<. 05. Epistaxis admissions also correlated with mean monthly temperatures with an increase in admissions noted in cold temperatures (< 10 degrees Celsius) p<. 05. Conclusion: This study shows an increase in epistaxis admissions in winter months and correlation with monthly temperatures. This finding is corroborated by similar studies in the UK and Europe. A possible explanation is the effect of indoor heating during winter on increasing nasal mucosal dryness. Further studies are required to confirm this seasonal variation as this can inform workforce planning for epistaxis management...|$|E

40|$|Rh-catalyzed {{asymmetric}} hydrogenation {{has emerged}} as a powerful tool for the manufacturing of chiral pharmaceuticals. While the mechanism is well understood, catalyst design a priori is not yet possible. Supramolecular catalysis, the use of noncovalent forces to affect a catalytic process, can afford the catalyst diversity required to uncover efficient catalysts and further our understanding. Using a modular design and self-assembly, a large scale supramolecular catalyst screening in a catalyst scaffold optimization study of rhodium-catalyzed asymmetric hydrogenation was carried out. Analyzing the data yields some new insights into the roles of each module making up the supramolecular catalyst. Perhaps most surprisingly, the presence of a chiral recognition element positioned remote to the site of catalysis can significantly impact the catalytic activity and enantioselectivity. ^ 1, 1 -Disubstituted alkenes are a challenging class of substrates for the asymmetric hydroboration reaction. Differentiation of the prochiral faces has been met with few successes from either stoichiometric or catalytic approaches. Takacs et al. revealed amide and ester groups direct the γ-selective Rh-catalyzed hydroboration of 1, 1 -disubstituted-β,γ-unsaturated alkenes. In the work described herein, analogous oximedirecting groups were used in an attempt to diversify the substrate scope. Unlike the amide- or ester-directed examples, we find oxime-directed hydroboration proceeds through an unusual C-H activation/metallation that proves crucial to turnover of borylated products. Whereas it was previously presumed that certain reduced byproducts were derived from adventitious H 2 reduction, deuterium-labeling experiments suggest competing pathways from a common intermediate leading to both borylated and reduced products. ^ In 1993, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared tuberculosis (TB) a global public <b>emergency.</b> <b>Current</b> drug treatments have reduced the mortality rate 40 % since 1990, but increasing numbers of drug-resistant tuberculosis strains have been reported. D-Cyloserine (DCS) is a second line drug for the treatment of TB. In a collaborative effort with Professors Robert Powers (UNL-Chemistry) and Raul Barletta (UNL Veterinary and Biomedical Sciences), experiments with an isotopically-labeled DCS were proposed to elucidate the mechanism. Previously reported routes were not amenable to the milligram quantities available for isotopically labeled serine starting material. The synthetic route that will be described was used to produce both labeled and unlabeled DCS. ...|$|E
40|$|Worldwide {{a renaissance}} {{of the nuclear}} {{industry}} is obviously taken place and many countries favour nuclear power as one reliable opportunity to generate electrical energy at very low CO 2 generating rates {{in order to avoid}} the green house effect in the earth atmosphere. However, since 1986 when the Tschernobyl accident was happening, nearly nowhere new nuclear power plants were established. The People Republic of China, India and in the last decade Japan, Finland and France are the exception. In other words, existing supply chains of former manufacturers were mainly destroyed or have changed its technical application field. Furthermore, a lot of technical expertise was lost as younger generations were influenced politically to find its interest in other scientific areas other than in nuclear physics or nuclear engineering. Even if we can observe today a change in mind in many countries concerning the acceptance of nuclear power the question seriously is to answer: Will we find enough well skilled technicians to reliably build all the planned nuclear power plants in the future? Therefore, life extension of existing plants the more plays an important role. This is truer as we have learnt in the last decades how many potential we have for life time extension even if we take into account ageing phenomena concerning the materials as thermal ageing, fatigue and neutron embrittlement when we think at steel components in the primary circuit; as there are the reactor pressure vessel, heat exchangers, surge line, pressurizer vessel, main cooling pumps and pipe lines. However, as in different countries life extension to an over all life time of 80 years is in discussion in future we have to take into account the infrastructure, i. e. bridges nearby, important for fluid traffic, <b>emergency</b> <b>current</b> generators, the concrete components of the containment and the cooling towers but also ageing phenomena of electric cable insulation, etc. Within these life time extension strategies the methodology of a continuously applied ageing management worldwide is seen as an important measure to guarantee nuclear safety. Besides the application of standardised non-destructive testing (NDT) technology during inservice inspection trials in order to perform a diagnosis of the material states online structural health monitoring of components by enhanced and intelligent NDT-sensors and sensor-networks will play a forthcoming future role. In Germany actually code-accepted procedures to perform ageing management were finally discussed and approved by the authorities. However, research and development in the last decade in the Nuclear Safety Research Programme of the German Ministry for Economy and Technology was continuously performed in order to develop and qualify NDT-technology for characterisation of ageing phenomena. The here presented chapter describes the objectives of this research and the final results obtained. In any case, the methodology of the micromagnetic NDT procedures was especially developed. This methodology is suitable for materials characterisation of magnetisable steels in terms of determination of mechanical properties. There are many similarities between movements of dislocations under mechanical loads and pinning of this lattice defects at vacancies, precipitates, grain and phase boundaries, contributing to the strength of the material and the movement of magnetic domains under magnetic loads, i. e. when the material is magnetised in a hysteresis loop. The methodology of the Micromagnetic, Multiparameter, Microstructure and Stess Analysis (3 MA) is discussed which on a wide basis of different diverse as well as redundant information allows the sensitive materials characterisation. In case of a Cu-rich steel alloy precipitation hardening is discussed in combination with thermal ageing. It is shown that superimposed fatigue loads will enhance the thermal ageing effect. Fatiguing of austenitic stainless steel under some conditions is combined with phase transformation from the face-centred-cubic (fcc) lattice to body-centred-cubic (bcc) martensitic phase which is ferromagnetic of nature. Where the carbon content is low enough to avoid the phase transformation other NDT techniques based on electric conductivity effects or ultrasonic wave propagation phenomena have to be applied. 3 MA is sensitive to characterise neutron embrittlement in pressure vessel materials. Material of western pressure vessel design as well as of Russian design were characterised which shows that a new NDT technology for inservice inspection of the pressure vessel wall from the id-surface can be developed...|$|E
