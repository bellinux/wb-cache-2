500|$|Minogue thought {{people liked}} Charlene {{because she was}} portrayed as an average Australian teenager, {{experiencing}} a difficult relationship with her mother. She continued, [...] "She {{is a bit of}} a rebel and they probably relate to that, and while she has her problems she will always come out on top." [...] Minogue shared some similarities with her character, but thought Charlene was far more outspoken and tomboyish than she was. Minogue liked that Charlene often said what she thought, but joked that <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> trouble and tried to punch someone like Charlene did, she would probably get [...] "flattened". Minogue also said Charlene was sensitive, but she was unlikely to show it and would [...] "rather die than be caught crying." ...|$|E
500|$|Beyoncé {{performed}} [...] "Dangerously in Love" [...] {{live for}} the first time at the Pepsi Arena in Albany, New York in 2001. The performance was also part of the setlist for their World Tour. Beyoncé also famously performed the song at the 2004 Grammy Awards on February 8, 2004, where it won in the category of Best Female R Vocal Performance. Beyoncé was wearing a long, glittery turquoise and silver dress. She positioned herself between the edges of a giant picture frame and sung [...] "Dangerously in Love 2" [...] as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a living oil painting. She was joined by seventeen backup singers, musicians and dancers. At the end, she held out her hand and a dove landed in her outstretched palm. Jon Wiederhorn of MTV News commented that the performance was [...] "nothing short of extravagant." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Candyman" [...] was filmed on January 28, 2007, {{in an airport}} hangar in Southern California. It was {{directed}} by Matthew Rolston and co-directed by Aguilera. The video {{is based on the}} 1940s World War II theme. In most of the music video, she dances and sings in three different hair colors: red, blonde and brown, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a singing trio, a tribute to The Andrews Sisters. In other shots she appears as the famous biceps-flexing factory worker from Westinghouse's [...] "We Can Do It!" [...] poster and as pin-up girls Judy Garland, Betty Grable and Rita Hayworth. The video also features product placement for Campari. Benji Schwimmer, 2006 winner of the American dancing competition So You Think You Can Dance, makes a cameo appearance as Aguilera's GI dance partner. Benji's sister Lacey Schwimmer also appears in the video as a jitterbugger. Aguilera asked Rolston to co-direct the video with her after he worked with her for a photo shoot for the cover of Rolling Stone. Shooting the sequences of Aguilera as a singing trio took the longest since they had to be shot for each hair color and camera angle, which was computer-controlled for precision. Choreography was carefully arranged so that none of the versions overlapped and the takes could be spliced together. The clip's color scheme is based on Technicolor films, focusing on primary colors and bright secondary colors.|$|E

2500|$|In October 2003, {{while in}} the UK to promote her film In the Cut, Meg Ryan made a {{controversial}} appearance on Parkinson, which resulted in negative publicity. The press accused both Ryan and Parkinson of being rude to one another. Ryan gave a few one-word answers, and after she acknowledged that she wasn't comfortable with the interview, Parkinson {{asked her what she}} would do <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> his position now. She replied that she would [...] "just wrap it up". Parkinson later revealed to the press that he felt her behaviour to his earlier guests, Trinny Woodall and Susannah Constantine, whom she turned her back on, was [...] "unforgivable". Ryan also commented that Parkinson was a [...] "nut" [...] and said that she was [...] "offended" [...] by him as he was like a [...] "disapproving father" [...] in his tone. A 2006 survey of British TV viewers, her behaviour on the show was voted the third [...] "most shocking" [...] TV chat show moment ever.|$|E
2500|$|Although general {{relativity}} {{is not required}} to analyze the twin paradox, application of the Equivalence Principle of {{general relativity}} does provide some additional insight into the subject. We had previously noted that Stella is not stationary in an inertial frame. Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. [...] When she is coasting her rest frame is inertial, and Terence's clock will appear to run slow. But when she fires her rockets for the turnaround, her rest frame is an accelerated frame and she experiences a force which is pushing her as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a gravitational field. Terence will appear to be high up in that field and because of gravitational time dilation, his clock will appear to run fast, {{so much so that the}} net result will be that Terence has aged more than Stella when they are back together. As will be discussed in the forthcoming section Curvature of time, the theoretical arguments predicting gravitational time dilation are not exclusive to general relativity. Any theory of gravity will predict gravitational time dilation if it respects the principle of equivalence, including Newton's theory.|$|E

60|$|You {{glance at}} her face to see <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> earnest, for you can {{remember}} three breakfasts, four luncheons, two dinners, and sandwiches between; but evidently <b>she</b> <b>is</b> not jesting. Then you yield.|$|R

6000|$|... "On {{the face}} of it," [...] Tavernake remarked, soberly, [...] "her offer seemed rather an absurd one. <b>If</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> earnest, <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> really so anxious to {{discover}} your whereabouts, <b>she</b> will certainly <b>be</b> {{able to do so}} without my help." ...|$|R
60|$|But there <b>are</b> certain {{instincts}} <b>in</b> every chivalrous man, {{which will}} not be gainsaid; among these is the impulse to go at once to {{the assistance of a}} woman <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>be</b> <b>in</b> trouble or difficulty.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{you love}} me, don't you?" [...] she murmured {{deep in her}} throat, almost as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> a trance, and swaying also {{as if she were}} swooned in an ecstasy of love.|$|E

60|$|SIR HOWARD. I {{am sorry}} to have to warn you, Mr. Rankin, that Lady Cicely, from {{travelling}} in Africa, has acquired a habit of walking into people's houses and behaving as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> her own.|$|E
50|$|Sabina {{enters the}} {{competition}} {{as a boy}} named Argo. Just like the other kids, Sabina undergoes a test, but she {{did it in a}} way that made the Paters argue <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>is</b> <b>in</b> or out of the competition.|$|R

6000|$|... "Oh, can't you understand? Look!" [...] Her voice dropped as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> church, and <b>she</b> {{switched}} on another light. It shone {{on the picture}} next to old Yeardsley's. [...] "There!" [...] she said. [...] "Clarence painted that!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Ha!' cried Sally, {{twitching}} a {{pinch of}} snuff out of her box, as spitefully as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> {{the very act of}} wrenching off the small servant's nose; 'she shall be safe enough from this time, I warrant you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{does not}} matter in the least, Frank," [...] Lady Greendale said. [...] "We know how she looks when she is at her best. We shall enjoy a quiet sail in her {{just as much as}} <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>were</b> <b>in</b> apple-pie order." ...|$|E

60|$|She glanced inquiringly at her mother. To all appearance, Mrs. Vanstone {{had been}} {{alarmed by the}} change in him also. She looked anxious and uneasy; she turned her face away on the sofa pillow--turned it suddenly, as <b>if</b> <b>she</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> pain.|$|R
