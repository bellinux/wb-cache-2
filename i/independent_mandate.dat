50|$|After {{retiring}} from politics, Rouble {{was appointed by}} Premier Pasloski as the Chair of the Yukon Land Use Planning Council, the body under the Yukon's Umbrella Final Agreement responsible for making recommendations to the Yukon Government on land use planning. The appointment drew disdain from the opposition and the media, since as Minister of Energy, Mines and Resources, Rouble had worked to undermine {{the recommendations of the}} Council's Peel Watershed Commission after six years of public consultations. There was concern that Rouble prejudiced the <b>independent</b> <b>mandate</b> of the Council and could weaken government relations with First Nations. Both the Yukon News and members of the opposition called upon Rouble to recuse himself of the appointment, which he did not. The process surrounding the Peel Watershed Commission eventually led to a legal challenge at the Supreme Court of Canada in 2017.|$|E
40|$|The {{interventions}} done by {{central banks}} in order either to provide liquidity or {{to help the}} recovery of economic growth, during the lasting effects of the recent financial crisis, have again brought into the light the question how the monetary policy is serving the best a sustainable growth. Beyond {{the fact that in}} Europe, especially within the European System of Central Banks (ESCB), we still stack on the <b>independent</b> <b>mandate</b> of price stability connected with that of the financial stability, there still exists the propensity to think in a different way the contribution of a central bank to the stated issue through its monetary policy conduct. I think that we cannot compare National Bank of Romania`s mandate with those of FED or other central banks issuing international reserve currency, but we also cannot totally neglect that between the monetary policy effects and the economic growth there is a link. The difference is that many believe that this has to be on purpose, e. g. the central banks instruments are ex ante calibrated for economic growth, while a correct approach is that the monetary policy conduct responding primarily to price stability is creating ex post the potential for a sustainable growth. Accepting that, we can start from financial stability to explain better how the monetary policy has a role in economic growth by not diluting the mandate and the independence of the central bank...|$|E

40|$|This report {{examines}} the governance structures {{and performance of}} industry superannuation funds in comparison to other superannuation funds in the Australian and international market. In 2010 the Super System Review (Cooper Inquiry) recommended that industry superannuation funds alter the current representative board structure to appoint a proportion of independent directors to all industry superannuation funds. Through {{a comprehensive review of}} published research together with an analysis of statistical data on both for-profit and not-for-profit superannuation funds, this report {{examines the}} relationship between their governance structures and performance in order to evaluate the efficacy of the Cooper Inquiry recommendations. The report concludes that evidence does not support the view that <b>mandating</b> <b>independent</b> directors on not-for-profit superanuation funds would improve fund performance. Instead, research and empirical data suggests strongly that the representative trustee governance structure of industry and other not-for-profit funds is actually the model that most closely satisfies the objectives of meeting the best interests of members and maximising retirement incomes for Australians...|$|R
50|$|Important {{provisions}} in the 1991 constitution would have lasting effects on the economy, particularly the articles that aided the overarching goal of facilitating progress toward long-awaited peace and political reconciliation. Of particular importance were the promotion of fiscal decentralization and the social {{role of the state}}. The aim of fiscal decentralization was to complement the process of political decentralization that had been initiated in the mid-1980s, with the popular election of city mayors. The social role of the state was deemed a necessary supplement to recent economic reforms, {{in order to ensure that}} the benefits resulting from these reforms would reach the vast majority of the population. The manner in which these critical issues were eventually handled had profound implications for the constant increases in public expenditure. Inasmuch as the growth in government outlays was not matched by increases in taxes or other government revenue, the fiscal {{provisions in}} the constitution had a negative effect on the public debt. The new constitution also made the Bank of the Republic <b>independent,</b> with a <b>mandate</b> to strive for a low and stable rate of inflation.|$|R
