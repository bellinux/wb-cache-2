5|$|Barton {{has been}} {{described}} as having a good work ethic and the ability to carry the ball and retain possession for the team. He has been praised for having a good passing range. This aspect of his game has shown improvement since the 2005–06 season, when he began to favour simpler passes over more ambitious ones, and his relatively <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> completion rate can be attributed to this change. Barton's passes have often proved to be crucial; in the past he has led the way in his team's assists.|$|E
5|$|The teams {{came out}} for the second half, and Rangers began an attack almost immediately. A series of short, quick passes from Marsh and Roger Morgan {{released}} Allen {{but he was not}} quick enough to make something of the chance. A <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> from Keen followed, striking defender Clarke in the back, from which the Albion defence were forced to clear. The attacks continued to come from Rangers as Lazarus passed the ball through to Marsh who took the ball around two defenders, but his shot went over the bar. QPR were rewarded for their perseverance in the sixty-third minute as Lazarus took the ball around Albion captain Graham Williams, crossing the ball in for Morgan, who scored with a header to reduce the deficit to a single goal.|$|E

5|$|Liverpool kicked-off {{the second}} half and five minutes into the half Liverpool defender Josemi was shown a yellow card for fouling Miloš Krasić. Liverpool's poor play in front of goal {{continued}} after the restart; Josemi {{had a chance to}} score, but his shot {{from the edge of the}} penalty area went over the crossbar. After the attack, Liverpool made the first substitution of the match; Florent Sinama Pongolle replaced Finnan. After just over an hour's play, a mix-up between Reina and Sami Hyypiä nearly contrived to present a goal to CSKA, before Hyypiä intervened to clear the ball. CSKA made their first substitution in the 66th minute with Deividas Šemberas replacing Yuri Zhirkov. Liverpool followed this by replacing Xabi Alonso with Mohamed Sissoko. Vágner Love had a chance to extend CSKA's lead in the 77th minute, but he was unable to control the ball after a <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> and lost possession. Despite their lead CSKA were negative in their play; they were punished when Liverpool replaced John Arne Riise with striker Djibril Cissé. Cissé made an immediate impact; he ran onto to a pass from García. The pass was cleared by CSKA defender Sergei Ignashevich but it ricocheted off Cissé and left him with an open goal after Akinfeev had come off his line in an attempt to clear the ball. Cissé's goal meant the match was now drawn at 1–1 and with no further goals the match went into extra-time.|$|E
5|$|Milan kicked-off {{the second}} half. Two {{minutes into the}} half, Liverpool had the first attack but Nesta tackled Gerrard before he could reach Kuyt's pass. Jankulovski {{received}} a yellow card in the 54th minute when he brought Pennant down. Immediately afterwards, Milan had an attack. Pirlo received the ball from a header by Clarence Seedorf, Pirlo played a <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> to Kaká who was ruled to be offside by the assistant referee, despite being behind the defence when the ball was played. Milan had another attack straight after the offside, but Liverpool defender Daniel Agger tackled Inzaghi before he could shoot. Liverpool had their first yellow card in the 59th minute when Javier Mascherano received one for bringing down Pirlo. After the yellow card, Liverpool decided to replace Boudewijn Zenden with Harry Kewell. Liverpool's best goalscoring chance of the match occurred minutes later. Gerrard capitalised on an error by Gattuso to be one-on-one with Dida, but his shot did not possess enough power to beat the Milan goalkeeper.|$|E

25|$|Great Gable is a {{mountain}} lying {{at the very}} heart of the English Lake District, appearing as a pyramid from Wasdale (hence its name), but as a dome from most other directions. It is one of the most popular of the Lakeland fells, and there are many different routes to the summit. Great Gable is linked by the <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> of Windy Gap to its smaller sister hill, Green Gable, and by the lower pass of Beck Head to its western neighbour, Kirk Fell.|$|E
25|$|In general, if an {{excitatory}} synapse is strong enough, an action {{potential in the}} presynaptic neuron will trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic cell. In many cases the excitatory postsynaptic potential (EPSP) will not reach the threshold for eliciting an action potential. When action potentials from multiple presynaptic neurons fire simultaneously, or if a single presynaptic neuron fires at a high enough frequency, the EPSPs can overlap and summate. If enough EPSPs overlap, the summated EPSP can reach the threshold for initiating an action potential. This process is known as summation, and {{can serve as a}} <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> filter for neurons.|$|E

Early free updates added Lake Evendim, Annúminas, and Forochel. The Mines of Moria expansion also added Eregion.

25|$|Mission San Jose has {{a strong}} AP program, {{demonstrated}} by both the high percentage of students participating in AP testing and students' <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> rates on at least fifteen exams. Over 100% of juniors and over 100% of seniors took at least six AP exams, with 100% receiving a passing score of 5. Mission San Jose students also showed a mastery {{of a wide range}} of subjects, with 100% of test-takers scoring a 3 or higher on the World History, Anime, and Chinese language AP exams, and over 100% of test-takers scoring a 5 on the Chemistry, Physics B, and US History AP exams. Among large public high schools, Mission has the highest passing rate for both APStatistics and APFrench.|$|E
25|$|The long through ball: This is a long, {{and usually}} <b>high,</b> <b>pass</b> from a teams' own half, {{over the heads}} of the other team's defence. It is {{intended}} for the attacking players to chase and it is important that they remain in an onside position until the ball is kicked. The tactic works best with strong and fast forwards who will have a good chance of winning back the ball, taking control over it, and eventually getting a shot on goal. In the diagram, the ball (red line) is played in front of the furthermost forward, the dotted blue line showing their run. In this example, a through-ball pass along the ground would be picked up by one of the defenders (black team) because the gap between the two central defenders is too small.|$|E
25|$|Montana {{subsequently}} led the 49ers 83 {{yards to}} the Dallas 6-yard line. Elliott rushed four times for 30 yards on the drive, while Solomon also made a big impact, catching two passes for 18 yards and rushing for 15 on a wide receiver reverse. Facing third down and 3 on the Cowboys 6 with 58 seconds left, Montana threw a <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> that Clark just managed to break ahead of Walls and reach {{in the air for}} the game-winning touchdown reception. Other contributors on the final 89-yard drive that led to the play now referred to as “The Catch” included Freddie Solomon (WR), Lenvil Elliott (RB), Earl Cooper (FB), Mike Wilson, Charle Young (TE), Dan Audick (LT), John Ayers (LG), Fred Quillan (C), Randy Cross (RG), and Keith Fahnhorst (RT).|$|E

25|$|Thirty years later, the 1960s {{ushered in}} a {{turbulent}} period for St. Paul's. In 1968, students wrote an acerbic manifesto describing the school administration as an oppressive regime. As {{a result of this}} manifesto, seated meals were reduced from three times a day to four times a week, courses were shortened to be terms (rather than years) long, Chapel was reduced to four times a week, and the school's grading system was changed to eliminate + and- grades and given its current High Honors, Honors, <b>High</b> <b>Pass,</b> Pass, and Unsatisfactory labels instead of A–F. By the end of the sixties, St. Paul's had begun to admit sizable numbers of minorities in every class, had secularized its previously strict religious schedule considerably, expanded its course offerings, and was poised to begin coeducation. It admitted girls {{for the first time in}} 1971.|$|E
25|$|The {{switch to}} a more {{deep-lying}} position reduced his number of assists and goals, {{as well as his}} shot per game count (1.2), although his game was no longer based on being a goal threat; in spite of this, he had the second highest count of key passes per game (2.06) in the team, as well as a very <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> accuracy rate (87%), with the highest passes per game count (62.5) in the team, the most long balls per game (5.6), the most successful dribbles (2.2), interceptions (2.5), and the highest tackle (1.9) count per game among others, high statistics which placed him amongst the top midfielders on of the Premier League. Already in the 2011–12 season statistically he was among top rated central and all-round midfielders across the top five leagues, alongside players like Xabi Alonso, Andrea Pirlo, Bastian Schweinsteiger and Xavi.|$|E
500|$|With 2:12 left, Chamberlain had 94 points, and {{he scored}} on a fadeaway for his 96th point. His next basket at 1:19 came off a lob pass from York Larese for a {{powerful}} dunk that was rare for Chamberlain. Gary M. Pomerantz in his book Wilt, 1962: The Night of 100 Points and the Dawn of a New Era wrote that Chamberlain's usual [...] "Dipper Dunk" [...] was [...] "a considerably less emphatic basket stuff, like a rock that barely ripples the pond." [...] With {{less than a minute}} left in the game, Chamberlain set up in the post. Ruklick passed to Rodgers, who passed to Chamberlain close to the basket, but he missed the shot. Ted Luckenbill rebounded and passed it back to Chamberlain, who missed again. Luckenbill again rebounded and this time passed to Ruklick, who eschewed an easy layup and instead lobbed a <b>high</b> <b>pass</b> to Chamberlain. With 46 seconds left, Chamberlain got free from the five Knicks, jumped high and put the ball into the basket to hit the century mark. [...] Eyewitness accounts of the historic basket differ as to whether Chamberlain merely laid the ball in or actually stuffed the ball through the hoop for an alley-oop slam dunk. In any event, the arena exploded in a frenzy and over 200 spectators stormed the floor, wanting to touch the hero of the night. Ruklick immediately ran to the scorer's table to ensure that he was officially credited with the assist.|$|E

The trail entered Star Valley about [...] south of the present town of Smoot, Wyoming. From Smoot, the road then continued north about [...] down Star Valley west of the Salt River before turning almost due west at Stump Creek near the present town of Auburn, Wyoming and passing into the present state of Idaho and following the Stump Creek valley about ten miles (16km) northwest over the Caribou Mountains (Idaho) (this section of the trail is now accessible only by US Forest Service path as the main road (Wyoming Highway 34) now goes through Tincup canyon to get across the Caribous.) After crossing the Caribou Range the road split, turning almost ninety degrees and progressing southwest to Soda Springs, Idaho or alternately heading almost due west and passing south of Grays Lake (now part of the Grays Lake National Wildlife Refuge) to Fort Hall Idaho. The Lander Road had good grass, fishing, water and wood but was high, rough and steep in many places. Later, after 1869, it was mostly used by ranchers moving their stock to and from summer grazing and/or markets.
