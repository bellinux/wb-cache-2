40|$|Age related macular {{degeneration}} (AMD) {{is one of}} the leading causes of blindness amongst the elderly. Macular pigment (MP) in the retina has been established to protect individuals against AMD. Improving levels of MP by diet or supplements is the constant quest of clinical practitioners and researchers, thus necessitating development of instruments capable of repeatable and reliable MP measurement. Cataract, a consequence of the rising opacity levels of the lens with age {{is one of the}} other major causes of blindness in the world. Mapcatsf, a LED-based microprocessor-controlled heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>photometer</b> (HFP) using photopic vision is capable of measuring the levels of MP and the opacity of the lens in terms of optical density. ^ Test-retest measurements conducted on 83 subjects were analyzed for repeatability in macular pigment optical density (MPOD) measurements. Reliability of the lens optical density (LOD) measurements were tested and compared with those obtained at absolute scotopic thresholds for 25 individuals. A supplement study with 32 individuals both in the young (50) age groups for 6 months further established Mapcatsf’s capacity to monitor changing levels of MP in individuals. As an overall outcome, high levels of repeatability and reliability were obtained in MPOD and LOD measurements establishing Mapcatsf as an instrument for use in clinical settings in the future. ...|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposeThis study {{evaluated}} the summed measures of macular pigment optical density (MPOD) spatial distribution {{and their effects}} on intraocular scatter using a commercially available device (C-Quant, Oculus, USA). MethodsA customized heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>photometer</b> (cHFP) device {{was used to measure}} MPOD spatial distribution across the central 16 ° using a 1 ° stimulus. MPOD was calculated as a discrete measure and summed measures across the central 1 °, 3. 3 °, 10 ° and 16 ° diameters. Intraocular scatter was determined as a mean of 5 trials in which reliability and repeatability measures were met using the C-Quant. MPOD spatial distribution maps were constructed and the effects of both discrete and summed values on intraocular scatter were examined. ResultsSpatial mapping identified mean values for discrete MPOD [0. 32 (s. d. = 0. 08) ], MPOD summed across central 1 ° [0. 37 (s. d. = 0. 11) ], MPOD summed across central 3. 3 ° [0. 85 (s. d. = 0. 20) ], MPOD summed across central 10 ° [1. 60 (s. d. = 0. 35) ] and MPOD summed across central 16 ° [1. 78 (s. d. = 0. 39) ]. Mean intraocular scatter was 0. 83 (s. d. = 0. 16) log units. While there were consistent trends for an inverse relationship between MPOD and scatter, these relationships were not statistically significant. Correlations between the highest and lowest quartiles of MPOD within the central 1 ° were near significance. ConclusionsWhile there was an overall trend of decreased intraocular forward scatter with increased MPOD consistent with selective short wavelength visible light attenuation, neither discrete nor summed values of MPOD significantly influence intraocular scatter as measured by the C-Quant device...|$|E

Participants underwent a comprehensive ocular evaluation, including visual acuity, evaluation of ocular dominance, slit lamp examination, intraocular pressure measurement, and optic nerve head and macula analysis using optical coherence tomography and fundus photography. All study participants after initial training underwent MPOD measurement twice in both eyes in a randomized sequence. The repeatability was tested using Altman and Bland plots for first measurements with the second measurements for right eye and left eye and additionally by grouping eyes {{as a function of}} ocular dominance. The Pearson correlation coefficient was performed to assess the intereye correlation of MPOD values. Results: The mean age of study participants was 35. 5  years (range 22 – 68  years). The mean MPOD measurements for OD (right eye) and OS (left eye) were 0. 47 and 0. 48, respectively, which followed a normal distribution (Shapiro–Wilk test, P= 0. 6 and 0. 2). The 95 % limits of agreement of Altman and Bland plots for the first and second measurements were - 0. 12 to + 0. 11 and - 0. 13 to + 0. 12 for OD and OS, respectively. The correlation coefficient of mean MPOD measurements of OD and OS was r statistic = 0. 94 (Pearson correlation coefficient P< 0. 0001; r 2 0. 89). The 95 % limits of agreement of Altman and Bland plots when evaluated by laterality of eye or by ocular dominance were narrow, with limits of agreement ranging from - 0. 13 to + 0. 12. Conclusion: The MPOD measurements obtained using the QuantifEye show good short-term repeatability. There is excellent intereye correlation, indicating that the MPOD values of one eye data can predict the fellow eye value with 89 % accuracy. The ocular dominance had no bearing on the outcome of this psychophysical test in ocular healthy eyes.

40|$|PURPOSE: To compare macular pigment {{optical density}} using two {{different}} heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>photometers.</b> METHODS: We measured macular pigment optical density in 121 healthy subjects using heterochromatic flicker photometry. RESULTS: The mean (+/-SD) macular pigment optical density measured using the Maculometer was 0. 394 (+/- 0. 170), and that using the Densitometer was 0. 395 (+/- 0. 189). The difference in measurements on each instrument {{was influenced by}} age and macular pigment levels. CONCLUSIONS: On average, {{there is no difference}} in measurements provided by these two instruments. The Maculometer tends to underestimate macular pigment in older subjects and/or those with higher macular pigment compared with the Densitometer...|$|R
40|$|Purpose:  Of the {{antioxidants}} {{found in}} the human retina, only the macular carotenoid quantities can be estimated noninvasively (albeit in a collective fashion), thus facilitating study of their role in that tissue. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate concordance between macular pigment optical density (MPOD) values recorded on a commercially available instrument, the MPS 9000, with those of an already validated heterochromatic flicker photometry instrument. Also, we assessed and compared test–retest variability for each instrument. Methods:  Macular pigment optical density at 0. 5 retinal eccentricity was measured using two different heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>photometers,</b> the MPS 9000 and the Macular DensitometerTM, in 39 healthy subjects. Test–retest variability was evaluated separately for each instrument by taking three readings over a 1 -week period in 25 subjects. Results:  There was a moderate positive correlation for MPOD at 0. 5 ° of retinal eccentricity between the MPS 9000 and the Macular Densitometer described by the linear equation y = 0. 763 x + 0. 172 (r = 0. 68, p < 0. 001, r 2 = 0. 46); however, a paired-samples t-test showed a significant difference in terms of mean values, with a bias of lower MPOD values being yielded by the MPS 9000 (t = − 4. 103, p < 0. 001). Bland–Altman analysis indicated only moderate agreement between the two instruments, reflected in 95 % limits of agreement of 0. 1 ± 0. 27. Inter-sessional repeatability, expressed as a coefficient of repeatability, ranged from 0. 18 to 0. 21 [mean (±SD) : 0. 19 (0. 02) ] for the MPS 9000 and from 0. 11 to 0. 12 [mean (±SD) : 0. 12 (0. 01) ] for the Macular Densitometer. Conclusion:  The results demonstrate that the MPS 9000 consistently yields MPOD readings, which are lower than that found with the Macular Densitometer, and exhibits substantial test–retest variability...|$|R
40|$|This review {{compares the}} results of studies that have {{investigated}} the impact of lutein and zeaxanthin supplementation on macular pigment optical density (MPOD) with those that have investigated the reliability of techniques used to measure macular pigment optical density. The review will focus on studies that have used heterochromatic flicker photometry for measurement of macular pigment optical density, as {{this is the only}} technique that is currently available commercially to clinicians. We identified articles that reported on supplementation with lutein and/or zeaxanthin and/or meso-zeaxanthin on macular pigment optical density measurement techniques published in peer-reviewed journals, through a multi-staged, systematic approach. Twenty-four studies have investigated the repeatability of MPOD measurements using heterochromatic flicker photometry. Of these, 10 studies provided a coefficient of repeatability or data from which the coefficient could be calculated, with a range in values of 0. 06 to 0. 58. The lowest coefficient of repeatability assessed on naïve subjects alone was 0. 08. These values tell us that, at best, changes greater than 0. 08 can be considered clinically significant and at worst, only changes greater than 0. 58 can be considered clinically significant. Six studies assessed the effect of supplementation with up to 20 mg/day lutein on macular pigment optical density measured using heterochromatic flicker photometry and the mean increase in macular pigment optical density ranged from 0. 025 to 0. 09. It seems reasonable to conclude that the chance of eliciting an increase in macular pigment optical density during six months of daily supplementation with between 10 and 20 mg lutein that is of sufficient magnitude to be detected by using heterochromatic flicker photometry on an individual basis is small. Commercially available heterochromatic <b>flicker</b> <b>photometers</b> for macular pigment optical density assessment in the clinical environment appear to demonstrate particularly poor coefficient of repeatability values. Clinicians should exercise caution when considering the purchase of these instruments for potential monitoring of macular pigment optical density in response to supplementation in individual patients...|$|R
