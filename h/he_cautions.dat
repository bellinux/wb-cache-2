They bring along Ed Hurley (Everett McGill), with Cooper having requisitioned $10,000 from the FBI to pass as high-stakes gamblers.|$|E
5|$|Kriegseisen {{notes that}} the {{institution}} of the sejmik gained a negative reputation following the partitions of Poland, and it has been described as one of the dysfunctional elements of the Polish political system that contributed to the fall of the Commonwealth. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> against such simplistic assessments, and traces them to 18th century publications whose negative views of the sejmiks have been rarely challenged since. The stereotype of a group of drunken, fighting nobility, found in some literature, should not be seen as representative, particularly outside the period of the sejmik's decline in the 18th century. He argues that while many sensationalist descriptions of debauchery, brawling or outright bloody violence at sejmiks have survived, they did so because they were just that—sensationalist—and should be seen as exceptions to the long, uneventful, but usually constructive proceedings that were much more common.|$|E

25|$|The Hungarian-American {{business}} magnate George Soros warns in “Does the Euro have a Future?” {{that there}} is no escape from the “gloomy scenario” of a prolonged European recession and the consequent threat to the Eurozone’s political cohesion so long as “the authorities persist in their current course.” He argues that to save the Euro long-term structural changes are essential in addition to the immediate steps needed to arrest the crisis. The changes he recommends include even greater economic integration of the European Union. Soros writes that a treaty is needed to transform the European Financial Stability Fund into a full-fledged European Treasury. Following the formation of the Treasury, European Council could then ask the European Commission Bank to step into the breach and indemnify the European Commission Bank in advance against potential risks to the Treasury’s solvency. Soros acknowledges that converting the EFSF into a European Treasury will necessitate “a radical change of heart.” In particular, <b>he</b> <b>cautions,</b> Germans will be wary of any such move, not least because many continue to believe that they have a choice between saving the Euro and abandoning it. Soros writes however that a collapse of European Union would precipitate an uncontrollable financial meltdown and thus “the only way” to avert “another Great Depression” is the formation of a European Treasury.|$|E

500|$|Sorabji {{has been}} {{described}} as a conservative composer who developed a highly idiosyncratic style fusing diverse influences. Even so, parallels have been identified between him and more progressive composers. Ullén describes Sorabji's Études transcendantes (100) (1940–44) as pieces that might be seen as [...] "presages of the piano music of, say, Ligeti, Finnissy or Ferneyhough", although <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> against overstating this. Some of Sorabji's pieces have even been described as forerunners of the music of Nancarrow. According to Habermann, [...] "The rhythmic structures within brackets [...] predate the complicated rhythms of Messiaen and Stockhausen." [...] Habermann also argues that Sorabji's fusion of tonality and atonality into a different approach to relationships between harmonies is a significant innovation.|$|E

Modern Europe and Christianity exist in a hypocritical state due to a tension between master and slave morality, both values contradictorily determining, to varying degrees, the values of most Europeans (who are [...] "motley"). Nietzsche calls for exceptional people to no longer be ashamed of their uniqueness {{in the face of a}} supposed morality-for-all, which he deems to be harmful to the flourishing of exceptional people. <b>He</b> <b>cautions,</b> however, that morality, per se, is not bad; it is good for the masses, and should be left to them.

2500|$|The {{issue of}} {{prejudice}} and discrimination against the disabled is raised in multiple contexts. In {{the dialogue between}} Uddālaka and Kahola in the first canto, Uddālaka says that {{with the success of}} Aṣṭāvakra, the disabled will no longer be deprived of their rights by the society. They will not be pushovers any more, no more be regarded as bad omens in auspicious rituals, and would be treated with equality. In the fourth canto, while speaking to Sujāta, Uddālaka says – the notion that the disabled are a burden on family and not worthy of attention will decay the world. <b>He</b> <b>cautions</b> against insulting and humiliating the disabled, and advises treating them with respect, else even the tears of the disabled will trample one in turn.

2500|$|The Glacier View meeting {{produced}} two consensus statements and formulated a ten-point summary that highlighted major points {{of difference between}} Ford’s positions and traditional Adventist teaching. Ultimately, the church's administration took action against Ford, revoking his ministerial credentials one month after Glacier View. Special issues of Ministry and Spectrum covered the event. A number of ministers resigned {{in the wake of}} Glacier View because they supported Ford's theology. By one count, 182 pastors in Australia and New Zealand left between 1980 and 1988, equivalent to [...] "an astonishing 40 percent of the total ministerial workforce" [...] in those countries. [...] This amounts to [...] "the most rapid and massive exit of Adventist pastors in the movement’s 150-year history" [...] (although <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> that the fallout may have involved more than one factor). Cottrell believes Ford has given more scholarly study to the belief and written more on it than any other person in history. [...] Ford subsequently formed the independent ministry Good News Unlimited and criticized many of the related church beliefs.|$|E
2500|$|Gregory's {{education}} was the standard Latin one of Late Antiquity, focusing on Virgil's Aeneid and Martianus Capella's Liber de Nuptiis Mercurii et Philologiae, but also other key texts such as Orosius' Chronicles, which his Historia continues, and Sallust; {{he refers to}} all these works in his own. His education, as was typical for the time, did not extend to a broad acquaintance with the pagan classics but rather progressed to mastery of the Vulgate Bible. It is said that he constantly complained about his use of grammar. He did not understand how to correctly write masculine and feminine phrases, reflecting either a lack of ability or changes in the Latin language. Though he had read Virgil, considered the greatest Latin stylist, <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> that [...] "We ought not to relate their lying fables, lest we fall under sentence of eternal death." [...] By contrast, {{he seems to have}} thoroughly studied the lengthy and complex Vulgate Bible, as well as numerous religious works and historical treatises, which he frequently quotes, particularly in the earlier books of the Historia.|$|E
2500|$|According to Slavieck, the [...] "traditional {{interpretation}} of the treaty's impact on Germany" [...] was that it [...] "plunged the nation into an economic free fall". This view was shared by the German people, who believed the treaty was robbing Germany of its wealth. German banker Max Warburg said {{the terms of the}} treaty were [...] "pillage on a global scale". Niall Ferguson says the German view was incorrect and [...] "not many historians would today agree with Warburg". However, several historians agree with Warburg. [...] Norman Davies writes that the treaty forced Germany to [...] "pay astronomic reparations", while Tim McNeese states, [...] "France and Britain had placed war damages on Germany to the tune of billions of gold marks, which the defeated Germans could not begin to pay in earnest". Ferguson says the reparations were [...] "less of a burden than Keynes and others claimed" [...] and that the [...] "potential burden on national income of the annuity vary from 5 percent to 10 percent". However, <b>he</b> <b>cautions</b> against underestimating the initial German effort to pay. Before the implementation of the Dawes Plan, Germany transferred between eight and 13 billion gold marks, which amounted to [...] "between 4 and 7 percent of total national income". Ferguson says [...] "the annuity demanded in 1921 put an intolerable strain on the state's finances" [...] and that total expenditure between 1920 and 1923 amounted to [...] "at least 50 percent of Reich revenue, 20 percent of total Reich spending and 10 percent of total public spending". Thus, Ferguson says, reparations [...] "undermined confidence in the Reich's creditworthiness" [...] and [...] "were therefore excessiveas the German government claimed".|$|E
