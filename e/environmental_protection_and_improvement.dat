40|$|Abstract Modern trends have pressed {{countries}} towards policy {{creation and}} its implementation {{into the national}} legislation. Due to its actuality, the <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> has emerged as an extremely significant area of interest regarding the policy creation for each country. The focus of the research is dual: firstly, to emphasize the treatment of <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> in the Constitution of the Republic of Macedonia, and secondly, to summarize the environment protection principles upon which the environmental legislation in the Republic of Macedonia is built. The aim {{of this paper is}} to determine the approach that the Republic of Macedonia practices in the field of environment policy making. The conducted research resulted in the conclusion that the right to a healthy environment is one of the basic rights of citizens in the Republic of Macedonia, according to its Constitution. Furthermore, the survey’s results suggest that the principles upon which the environmental legislation is built reflect the latest accomplishments in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> its <b>improvement.</b> Keywords: Environment, Constitution, Law, Principles. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{accordance}} with the requirements for the protection and development of environment, the usage of spatial data represents a specific need for different kinds of geographical and cartographical information. Theoretical and practical understanding of these requirements, with existing experiences {{and the use of}} appropriate standards, help in the process of solving particular ecological problems. In this paper, the analysis (theoretical understanding of the problem) and the comparison of models will try to point out the importance, requirements and possibilities of using existing data from different geo-topographical materials such as charts at different scales in analog as well as digital forms. Sources of information about an area: Cartographic-analytic collecting of spatial information for environmental purposes is carried out mainly from the following sources: satellite images, geographic information systems / Environmental Information Systems (GIS / EIS), Geo-topographic materials in analogue and digital (especially maps) forms and physical measurements of ambient environment. Types of maps which can be used for environmental protection: Base maps are widely used mostly for military purposes. Being highly detailed, these maps can be largely used for the purposes of environmental protection, especially topographic maps of a scale of 1 : 25 000 to 1 : 200 000 and 1 : 250 000. Thematic maps primarily give information on specific locations and specific content. For the purposes of <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement,</b> thematic maps with specific topics are constructed most frequently. Combined maps are specific and they are a combination of base and thematic maps. These are, for example, political, travel, touristic, hydrological, and synoptic maps. Synthetic maps show the results and analysis of data collected. They cannot display all the characteristics or information related to the environment, especially data about complex ecosystems. Conclusion: For the purposes of <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement,</b> the existing geo-topographic materials can be used, especially maps in the analogue and digital form. Based on the content and topics depicted, there are many different types of maps. All maps, especially those with the specific content important for environment, have highly variable characteristics. The geo-topographic materials of different scales and shapes, both in analogue and digital forms, in the Military Geographic Institute (MGI) are a good basis for <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> purposes...|$|E
30|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the relationship between}} industrial development and environmental protection. The paper argues that human beings cannot solve the problems linked {{to the environment and}} the natural resources in a stagnant manner, nor can human beings achieve sustainable development in the extensive economic growth model of ignoring resource constraints and the environment. The difficulties of China's environmental protection lie in the balance {{of the relationship between the}} reform of regulation governing resources and the environmental and the international competitiveness of China's industrial sector, in particular, the balance of the relationship between environmental protection and economic growth. China's industrialization practices show that the country's industrial sector itself has the potential to help promote the improvement of the utilization efficiency of resources and the environment. At the same time, however, it can consume significant resources, causing certain environmental degradation. Industrial processes can have negative environmental impacts, but industrial development can play a positive role in <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement</b> from a global and long-term perspective. It is impossible for China to solve the problems linked to resources and the environment without the development of industrial entities. On the contrary, the pressure on the resources and the environment can only be relieved with more advanced and powerful industries. In China, public opinion on environmental protection has been formed and will become stronger. Therefore, we have reason to be optimistic for the country's <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>improvement.</b>|$|E

As {{a result of these}} extraordinary attributes, vetiver has been used successfully in more than 120 countries for <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> purposes, particularly in the area of treating polluted or contaminated water. Vetiver is a tall and erect grass; it has light purple flower heads but sets no seed. When planting close together in row it forms a dense hedge or in space planting, it can be easily incorporated into general landscaping plan. Vetiver grass has been previously used for landscaping in Asia, Europe and Africa, but recently it has also been used successfully for both pollution control and landscaping {{at the same time in}} some Delfin Lendlease Corporation projects in Australia.

Although shipping operations are beneficial to global trade {{as well as}} economic development of countries, the related activities can cause environmental harm, e. g., CO 2 emissions and ballast water discharge. As a result, public concerns about the environmental damages caused by shipping activities in servicing international trade are on the rise. To balance <b>environmental</b> <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> business performance <b>improvement,</b> shipping firms should {{pay more attention to the}} environmental and financial ramifications of their business routines. This study proposes the concept of Greening and Performance Relativity (GPR) and uses an input-output analytic approach to investigate how greening operations are related to firm performance in shipping operations. We present theory-driven arguments on the link between environmental and financial performance outcomes and empirically validate them with survey data collected from shipping firms. We also examine application of the GPR concept using survey data from the shipping industry in Hong Kong. Our analysis results show that there is a positive association between greening and firm performance in shipping operations. The results also indicate that shipping firms possess reasonably good capability in the business routines of "company policy and procedure", "shipping documentation", "shipping materials", and "shipping design for compliance".

40|$|Since the 1980 s {{there has}} been an {{explosion}} in the number of international investment agreements around the world, from a few hundred, to well over 3000. They form part of the global domination of neo-liberal economic thinking, placing the needs of businesses above all else. Contained within many is the mechanism of international investment arbitration which gives foreign corporations the right to sue countries that legislate in ways that negatively affect their profit making ability. Convened tribunal's disregard considerations not related directly to the alleged expropriation suffered by foreign investors as they are not mandated to consider other factors, such as human rights. However the judgements often have significant impacts on a range of human rights with countries penalised for acting to protect {{the health and well-being of}} their people and the environment. No issue is neglected with arbitration challenging sovereign choices on areas such as racial equality, <b>environmental</b> <b>protection,</b> health <b>improvement</b> <b>and</b> power supply. Not only does this affect sued countries directly but also weakens other states legislative desire to follow a similar course of action. In this way international investment arbitration acts as a system of global governance, weakening sovereignty, democracy and human rights fulfilment. Overall I will argue that international investment arbitration places too much power in the hands of multinational corporations to the detriment of human rights. In order to protect sovereignty, democracy and human rights these agreements must be renounced...|$|R

Its three pillars regulate access to information, public {{participation in}} decision making, and access to justice. This document contains procedural rights, but the term "public concerned" is especially important. The Convention leaves it up to member states to determine who comprises "the public".
