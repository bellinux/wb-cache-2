Inrush current usually lasts {{for half a}} second, or a few milliseconds, but it is often very high, which makes it dangerous because it can degrade and burn components gradually (over months or years), especially {{if there is no}} inrush current protection. Alternating current transformers or electric motors in automatic voltage regulators may draw and output several times their normal full-load current for a few cycles of the input waveform when first energized or switched on. Power converters also often have inrush currents much higher than their steady state currents, due to the charging current of the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance.</b>|$|E

[...] However, the input impedance is made a specific nominal value, rather than arbitrarily high, because of the common use of X10 probes. [...] A common value for oscilloscope nominal impedance is 1 MΩ resistance and [...] 20 pF capacitance. [...] With a known input impedance to the oscilloscope, the probe designer can ensure that the probe input impedance is exactly ten times this figure (actually oscilloscope plus probe cable impedance). [...] Since the impedance included the <b>input</b> <b>capacitance</b> and the probe is an impedance divider circuit, {{the result is that}} the waveform being measured is not distorted by the RC circuit formed by the probe resistance and the capacitance of the input (or the cable capacitance which is generally higher).|$|E

Firstly, a simulation model for flyback ac-dc converter is obtained {{by adding the}} rectifier and filter circuit to a flyback dc-dc converter model developed by the authors. The simulation {{results show that the}} processes of capacitor charging and discharging are independent, their boundary is near the maximal value of input voltage, and the part of flyback dc-dc converter can be seen as an approximately constant power load. Secondly, an analytic model for deciding the input power of flyback dc-dc converter with rated load and different input dc voltages is presented. Furthermore, the effect caused by the parasitical parameters in the electronic parts is studied, and the corresponding analytical method for deciding the <b>input</b> filter <b>capacitance</b> is given.

The first, using LC tank locked oscillators as frequency dividers, is tailored to UNITS and show high driving capability with low power. Simple and accurate equations for the design are reported. The second quadrature generator, employing coupled VCOs driven by an auxiliary VCO, is tailored to DCS 1800 and achieves outstanding phase accuracy and phase noise.

40|$|The {{problem of}} multiple-input {{switching}} (MIS) has been mostly {{ignored by the}} timing CAD community. Not modeling MIS for timing can result {{in as much as}} 100 % error in stage delay and slew calculation. The impact is especially severe on stages immediately after a bank of flops, where the inputs have a high probability of arriving simultaneously. Other problems such as modeling of interconnect loads, complex (nonlinear/non-monotonic) input waveforms, power-droop impact on cell delay, nonlinear <b>input</b> <b>capacitances,</b> delay variations due to cross-capacitance, etc. are also known sources of error. In this paper, we introduce the multi-port current source model (MCSM). MCSM can efficiently handle an arbitrary number of simultaneously switching inputs, including single-input switching (SIS). Moreover, MCSM is comprehensive in that other modeling problems associated with delay and noise computation are elegantly covered. We demonstrate the applicability of MCSM on a large 65 nm industrial test-case. For cells experiencing MIS, the model yields delay and slew-rate errors within ± 5 % for 88. 3 % and 93. 0 % of the cases, respectively.
