[...] After his parole in 1952 he quickly rose to become one of the organization's most influential leaders, serving as the public face of the controversial group for a dozen years.

40|$|Twenty-one incarcerated {{drug dealers}} and 60 opiate users were {{questioned}} about the provision of “freebies ” (<b>free</b> <b>drugs)</b> and credit in drug market transactions in London and the UK. In particular, each group {{was asked about the}} context within which either of these activities might occur and the underlying rationales for them. In contradiction to the common image of drug dealers providing “freebies ” as an attempt to secure the custom of nonaddicted individuals (often portrayed as children), it emerged that the provision of <b>free</b> <b>drugs</b> and credit took place within tightly circumscribed conditions. Primarily, the provision of <b>free</b> <b>drugs</b> and credit (two distinct modes of operation with differing outcomes) were available to those known and “trusted ” by the dealer and used to cultivate and bond customer relations (freebies) as well as facilitate continued business with the reliable (credit). Credit was not used to “trap ” individuals into a dealing relationship. Rather, both parties approach it cautiously. How the provision of <b>free</b> <b>drugs</b> and credit are representative of broader aspects of dealer/user seller/buyer relationships, with particular emphasis on the management of that relationship, is discussed. Brief consideration is also given to the context of drug sales at raves and other dance events, as it is often the case that “the offer ” in this context may be made to users unknown to the dealer.

40|$|Liposomes, {{which are}} vesicles {{composed}} of a phospholipid bilayer surrounding an aqueous milieu, represent a new strategy for anticancer drug delivery. Extravasation and accumulation of liposomal drugs within neoplastic tissues are possible because of the leaky vasculature and scarce lymphatic vessels of tumours (the enhanced permeability and retention effect). Furthermore, liposomal chemotherapeutic agents display distinctive pharmacokinetic characteristics, because they possess longer elimination half-lives, reduced clearance and smaller volume of distribution with respect to corresponding <b>free</b> <b>drugs.</b> Taken together, these features lead to highest levels of cytotoxic agents in tumours, as demonstrated in preclinical models and clinical trials, whereas healthy tissues are spared from toxicity. In fact, liposomal drugs (i. e., doxorubicin), alone or {{in combination with other}} cytotoxic agents, lead to improved clinical effectiveness and ameliorated toxicity profile with respect to corresponding <b>free</b> <b>drugs</b> when they are used for the treatment of metastatic breast and ovarian cancers, and Kaposi's sarcoma...|$|R
