5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an intelligent control. Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, an {{independent}} trader, Cyrano Jones (Stanley Adams), arrives {{on the station}} with some tribbles. He gives one to Lt. Uhura (Nichelle Nichols), who brings it on board the Enterprise, where it and its quickly-produced offspring are treated as adorable pets. The animals purr a relaxing trill that the crew find soothing. Klingons, however, find tribbles annoying, and the <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> mutual: tribbles hiss and shriek whenever they are near Klingons.|$|E

The brand <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> classified into six types. The first three types of brand <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> experiential and immediate: (a)'warmth' feeling (b)'fun' feeling (c)'excitement' feeling. The next three types of brand <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> private and enduring (d)'security' feeling (e)'social approval' feeling (f)'self-respect' feeling.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project is to discuss how <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> {{experienced}} and what feelings mean to the conscious experience of the world. To do so, this project examines A theory of the emotions, by Jean-Paul Sartre, which discusses emotions from a phenomenological standpoint. Sartre characterizes feelings as constituting a magical world where <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> ultimately understood as being internal conscious meaningful phenomena and sometimes determined by social experiences. In order to elaborate and discuss Sartre's ideas, perspectives on emotions and beliefs are examined through a cognitive psychological perspective. This project concludes that the significance of <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> best understood from a phenomenological standpoint where <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> approached as situated meaning, which is continually negotiated by situational demands and internal motives. Furthermore this project concludes that the individual person's ability to understand their subjective <b>feelings</b> <b>is</b> dependent {{on the ability to}} become aware and reflect on the situational, motivational and social nature of his or her feelings...|$|R
50|$|Smith {{presents}} {{the argument that}} approval or disapproval of the <b>feelings</b> of others <b>is</b> completely determined by whether we sympathize or fail to sympathize with their emotions. Specifically, if we sympathize with the feelings of another we judge that their <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> just, {{and if we do}} not sympathize we judge that their <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> unjust.|$|R

25|$|Concerning {{the role}} of clave in salsa music, Charley Gerard states: “The clave <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> in the music {{whether or not the}} claves are {{actually}} being played.” Every ostinato part which spans a cycle of four main beats, has a specific alignment with clave, and expresses the rhythmic qualities of clave either explicitly or implicitly. Every salsa musician must know how their particular part fits with clave, and with the other parts of the ensemble.|$|E

In addition, self concepts support subsequent positive feelings about social activities (MSM-S β(T 1 -T 2)[*]=[*] 0.23).|$|R

25|$|It is very {{difficult}} to speak of the voice of Callas. Her voice was a very special instrument. Something happens sometimes with string instruments—violin, viola, cello—where the first moment you listen to the sound of this instrument, the first <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> a bit strange sometimes. But after just a few minutes, when you get used to, when you become friends with this kind of sound, then the sound becomes a magical quality. This was Callas.|$|E
25|$|A new {{technology}} has been developed and is slowly becoming more popular with police. Called the Rumbler, it is a siren that emits a low frequency sound which can be felt. Motorists that may have loud music playing in their car, for example, may not hear the audible siren of a police car behind them, but will feel the vibrations of the Rumbler. The <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> that of {{standing next to a}} large speaker with pumped bass.|$|E
25|$|Vicarious shame: {{refers to}} the {{experience}} of shame on behalf of another person. Individuals vary in their tendency to experience vicarious shame, which is related to neuroticism and to the tendency to experience personal shame. Extremely shame-prone people might even experience vicarious shame even to an increased degree, in other words: shame on behalf of another person who is already feeling shame on behalf of a third party (or possibly on behalf of the individual proper). The Dutch term for this <b>feeling</b> <b>is</b> 'plaatsvervangende schaamte', the German term is 'die Fremdscham' and in the Spanish language it is referred to as 'vergüenza ajena'.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to show the {{significance}} of feelings in ethics. First, I will explain that the way of caring in terminal care enables us to accept patient's <b>feelings.</b> It <b>is</b> important for patients to express their own feelings to relieve pain, anger, grief and so on. Secondly, I will show that incidents such as ethnic conflict can not be solved simply by justice. Hatred and desire for revenge can not be removed by judgements or punishments. Such <b>feelings</b> have to <b>be</b> healed. Finally, I try to value feelings highly from a standpoint of virtue ethics. According to Aristotle, acting with opportune <b>feelings</b> <b>is</b> virtuous. Here the <b>feelings</b> <b>are</b> not opposed to reason, but rather reasonable. Everywhere in society, expressing <b>feelings</b> adequately <b>is</b> required...|$|R
