25|$|If {{a purely}} {{resistive}} load {{is connected to}} a power supply, current and voltage will change polarity in step, the power factor will be 1, and the electrical energy flows in a single direction across the network in each cycle. <b>Inductive</b> <b>loads</b> such as induction motors (any type of wound coil) consume reactive power with current waveform lagging the voltage. Capacitive loads such as capacitor banks or buried cable generate reactive power with current phase leading the voltage. Both types of loads will absorb energy during part of the AC cycle, which is stored in the device's magnetic or electric field, only to return this energy back to the source {{during the rest of}} the cycle.|$|E
25|$|Power factor {{correction}} brings the power factor of an AC power circuit closer to 1 by supplying or absorbing reactive power, adding capacitors or inductors that act {{to cancel the}} inductive or capacitive effects of the load, respectively. In the case of offsetting the inductive effect of motor loads, capacitors can be locally connected. These capacitors help to generate reactive power {{to meet the demand}} of the <b>inductive</b> <b>loads.</b> This will keep that reactive power from having to flow {{all the way from the}} utility generator to the load. In the electricity industry, inductors are said to consume reactive power and capacitors are said to supply it, even though reactive power is just energy moving back and forth on each AC cycle.|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, MOSFETs {{are widely}} used in many types of analog {{circuits}} because of their own advantages (zero gate current, high and adjustable output impedance and improved robustness vs. BJTs which can be permanently degraded by even lightly breaking down the emitter-base). The characteristics and performance of many analog circuits can be scaled up or down by changing the sizes (length and width) of the MOSFETs used. By comparison, in bipolar transistors {{the size of the}} device does not significantly affect its performance. MOSFETs' ideal characteristics regarding gate current (zero) and drain-source offset voltage (zero) also make them nearly ideal switch elements, and also make switched capacitor analog circuits practical. In their linear region, MOSFETs can be used as precision resistors, which can have a much higher controlled resistance than BJTs. In high power circuits, MOSFETs sometimes have the advantage of not suffering from thermal runaway as BJTs do. Also, MOSFETs can be configured to perform as capacitors and gyrator circuits which allow op-amps made from them to appear as inductors, thereby allowing all of the normal analog devices on a chip (except for diodes, which can be made smaller than a MOSFET anyway) to be built entirely out of MOSFETs. This means that complete analog circuits can be made on a silicon chip in a much smaller space and with simpler fabrication techniques. MOSFETS are ideally suited to switch <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> because of tolerance to inductive kickback.|$|E

50|$|An <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> {{consists}} of an iron-core reactive element which, when {{used in conjunction with}} a resistive load bank, creates a lagging power factor <b>load.</b> Typically, the <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> will be rated at a numeric value 75% that of the corresponding resistive load such that when applied together a resultant 0.8 power factor load is provided. That is to say, for each 100 kW of resistive load, 75 kVAr of <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> is provided. Other ratios are possible to obtain other power factor ratings. An <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> is used to simulate a real-life mixed commercial loads consisting of lighting, heating, motors, transformers, etc. With a resistive-inductive load bank, full power system testing is possible, because the provided impedance supplies currents out of phase with voltage and allows for performance evaluation of generators, voltage regulators, load tap changers, conductors, switchgear and other equipment.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{operation}} {{principle of the}} Z-source inverter is analysed in detail. According to the characteristics of allowed short–shrougt zero state in the Z-source inverter, SPWM control method of the Z-source inverter is obtained by inserting fixed short–shrougt zero state into zero state of SPWM. It is simple and easily implemented in practice. However, in <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> condition the output voltage and current of Z-source inverter have serious distortion and affect the inverting quality. The cause of this distortion is analysed in detail and an improved SPWM control method is proposed, which can better solve the output voltage and current distortion problem of the Z-source inverter under the condition of <b>inductive</b> <b>load.</b> Matlab simulation results verify that the improved SPWM control method not only eliminates distortion caused by <b>inductive</b> <b>load,</b> but also decreases the switch times and quantities in each cycle. Therefore, it decreases the THD of AC output effectively and improves {{the efficiency of the}} inverter, and its theoretical analysis is verified to be effective.

2500|$|Since {{the units}} are consistent, the power factor is by {{definition}} a dimensionless number between −1 and 1. When power factor is equal to 0, the energy flow is entirely reactive and stored energy in the load returns to the source on each cycle. When the power factor is 1, all the energy supplied by the source is consumed by the load. Power factors are usually stated as [...] "leading" [...] or [...] "lagging" [...] to show {{the sign of the}} phase angle. Capacitive loads are leading (current leads voltage), and <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> are lagging (current lags voltage).|$|E

50|$|Real {{transmission}} lines typically serve <b>inductive</b> <b>loads,</b> {{which are the}} motors that exist everywhere in modern electronics and machines. Transferring {{a large amount of}} reactive power Q to <b>inductive</b> <b>loads</b> makes the line current lag voltage, and the voltage regulation is characterized by decrease in voltage magnitude. In transferring a large amount of real power P to real loads, current is mostly in phase with voltage. The voltage regulation in this scenario is characterized by a decrease in phase angle rather than magnitude.|$|E
50|$|When relay {{contacts}} open to interrupt a high current with an <b>inductive</b> <b>load,</b> a voltage spike will result, striking an arc across the contacts. If the voltage is high enough, an arc may be struck even without an <b>inductive</b> <b>load.</b> Regardless {{of how the}} arc forms, it will persist until the current through the arc falls to the point too low to sustain it. Arcing damages the electrical contacts, and a sustained arc may prevent the open contacts from removing power from the system being controlled.|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} {{investigations and}} {{detailed analysis of}} ringing in a non-resonant pulsednuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) circuit. Ringing is a commonly observed phenomenon in high power switching circuits. The oscillations described as ringing impede measurements in pulsed NMR systems.

It is observed that the parasitics associated with the <b>inductive</b> <b>load</b> become important at certain frequencies.
