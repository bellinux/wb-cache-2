5000|$|In {{firearms}} terminology, the firearm receiver or firearm {{frame is}} the part of a firearm which provides housing for the <b>hammer,</b> <b>bolt</b> or breechblock, and firing mechanism, and which is usually threaded at its forward portion to receive the barrel. [...] The receiver is often made of forged, machined, or stamped steel or aluminium; in addition to these traditional materials, modern science and engineering have introduced polymers and sintered metal powders to receiver construction.|$|E
50|$|Forced entry {{involves}} the use of tools such as <b>hammers,</b> <b>bolt</b> cutters, chisels, and drills; consequently, forced entry attacks exhibit obvious signs of entry. Surreptitious attacks involve picks, bump keys, shims, unauthorized key duplication, and other bypass techniques that, when employed, do not show obvious signs of compromise.|$|R
50|$|An {{electropneumatic}} paintball marker is a paintball marker {{that uses}} a pneumatic solenoid to actuate the <b>hammer</b> and/or <b>bolt's</b> movement.|$|R
50|$|In a firearm, the sear is {{the part}} of the trigger {{mechanism}} that holds the <b>hammer,</b> striker, or <b>bolt</b> back until the correct amount of pressure has been applied to the trigger; at which point the <b>hammer,</b> striker, or <b>bolt</b> is released to discharge the weapon. The sear may be a separate part or can be a surface incorporated into the trigger.|$|R
50|$|There {{are some}} cartoon tools as well, {{including}} <b>Hammer,</b> Saw, the <b>Bolts,</b> the Nuts, Ruler, the Spanners and Oil Can. Pump narrates this segment.|$|R
50|$|The {{cause of}} the blaze was {{ultimately}} traced to a lot in Agua Dulce where workers were using a <b>hammer</b> to extract <b>bolts</b> from a tire rim and created sparks.|$|R
50|$|The Shocker {{used two}} {{solenoid-operated}} control valves {{in order to}} obtain separate controls over the ball loading sequence and the air delivery sequence. The Angel made use of a linked <b>hammer</b> and <b>bolt</b> assembly, which permitted the use of a single solenoid to actuate the entire firing sequence by controlling a piston that powered the hammer/bolt assembly forward, simultaneously chambering a paintball and releasing the propulsion gases {{at the end of the}} hammer's stroke.|$|R
50|$|An Oliver hammer was a treadle-operated <b>hammer</b> that forged <b>bolts</b> {{by forcing}} red hot lengths of iron into a die. The machine shop {{contained}} several Oliver hammers used to forge special parts to order. It {{was founded by}} Onan Lowe and taken over by T. W. Lench Ltd.|$|R
50|$|M1: Harrington & Richardson was {{assigned}} serial number ranges 4660001 through 4800000, 5488247 through 5793847, and 400 rifles numbered from 6034330 through 6034729. The major components, {{such as the}} barrel, <b>bolt,</b> <b>hammer,</b> operating rod, safety, and trigger housing were stamped with a numeric drawing number and the manufacturer's initials. Harrington & Richardson rifles are marked HRA on all marked parts except the receivers, which were stamped H&R ARMS CO.|$|R
5000|$|A trigger {{disconnector}} {{captures the}} hammer in the cocked position after a shot has been fired, {{even if the}} trigger is held to the rear as the gun cycles. This ensures the gun can only fire in the semi-automatic mode, as the trigger needs to be released to 'reset' and have the disconnector release the hammer back to the trigger sear. It also prevents out-of-battery [...] "slamfire" [...] malfunctions that occur when a <b>hammer</b> follows the <b>bolt</b> carrier group forward as it closes.|$|R
5000|$|Nelson Valve: Named {{after the}} Nelson Paint Company whose marker, the Nelspot 007, first {{employed}} this mechanism. In such markers the <b>bolt,</b> <b>hammer</b> and valve are all {{located in the}} same tube. To cock the mechanism, the bolt is pulled back against the main spring to allow a paintball {{to fall into the}} breach, at which point the sear latches the <b>hammer</b> to the <b>bolt</b> with the compressed main spring in between them. The <b>bolt</b> and attached <b>hammer</b> are then pushed forward to close the breach and load the paintball into the barrel, at which point the sear can be engaged by the trigger and the marker is ready to fire. Pulling the trigger dissengages the sear from the bolt, allowing the main spring to propel the hammer rearwards onto the powertube, thus opening the valve and allowing compressed gases to flow from the valve chamber to the barrel through the powertube and bolt which propel the loaded paintball forward. The valve is then closed by the valve spring and the marker is ready to be re-cocked for the next shot. Notable examples of markers which employ this mechanism are the Nelson Nelspot 007, the CCI Phantom and the Redux.|$|R
5000|$|In 2010, Pioneer Arms, of Radom, Poland, began {{producing}} a semi-auto only {{version of the}} PPS design, called the PPS-43c. The gun, sold with its stock fixed in the closed position, is legally considered a pistol in the United States. The gun is of a closed <b>bolt,</b> <b>hammer</b> fired, blow back operated design {{as opposed to the}} open-bolt design of the PPS-43. According to a report in the July 20, 2012 edition of Shotgun News, the PPS-43C utilizes many parts from unissued PPS-43 submachine guns mounted on new PPS-43C receivers.|$|R
2500|$|The M1A1, {{standardized}} in October 1942 as the United States Submachine Gun, Cal[...]45, M1A1, {{could be}} produced in half {{the time of the}} M1928A1, and at a much lower cost. The main difference between the M1 and M1A1 was the bolt. The M1 bolt had a floating firing pin and <b>hammer,</b> the <b>bolt</b> of the M1A1 had the firing pin machined to the face of the bolt, eliminating unnecessary parts. The reinforced stock and protective sight wings were standard. The 30-round magazine became more common. In 1939, Thompsons cost the government $209 apiece. By the spring of 1942, cost-reduction design changes had brought this down to $70. In February 1944, the M1A1 reached a low price of $45 each, including accessories and spare parts, although the difference in price between the M1 and M1A1 was only $0.06. By the end of the war, the M1A1 was replaced with the even lower-cost M3 (commonly called the [...] "Grease Gun").|$|R
50|$|The 870 {{features}} a bottom-loading, side ejecting receiver, tubular magazine under the barrel, dual action bars, internal <b>hammer,</b> and a <b>bolt</b> which locks into an extension in the barrel. The action, receiver, fire control group, safety catch and slide release catch of the Remington Model 870 shotgun {{are similar to}} those used on the Remington Model 7600 series pump-action centerfire rifles and carbines. The basic fire control group design was first used in the automatic 11-48. Twelve gauge stocks will also interchange on the older 12-gauge-sized 20-gauge receivers, although modification is needed to fit the smaller sized 20-gauge receivers employed since the late 1970s. Several parts of the 870 will interchange with the semi-automatic Remington 1100 and 11-87.|$|R
5000|$|Sound {{waves are}} semi-directional. They consist of both Point- and Line-wave propagation. The {{projectile}} emanates mostly line-propagation properties {{after leaving the}} barrel. At the moment that the projectile is exiting the barrel it produces a mainly point-biased wave generation. (This {{is largely due to}} the shock waves traveling forward along the interior of the barrel, thus preventing any backward travel from the projectile into the barrel.) Sound waves travel in an ever-expanding bubble emanating from the muzzle when the propellant gases are traveling at supersonic speeds. This is called the [...] "muzzle blast." [...] Except in extremely low pressure loads, the exiting propellant gasses generate much higher sound pressure levels (dBa) than any other aspect of the weapon firing. (e.g., <b>hammer,</b> sear, <b>bolt,</b> supersonic flight signature, etc.) The supersonic [...] "ballistic crack" [...] is typically 136-138 dB, whereas [...] "muzzle blast" [...] may reach 168 dB. By encircling the muzzle, the shroud funnels and focuses the sound waves along the projectile flight axis, away from the shooter. This alone can partially protect the shooter from 12-18 dB of blast returning to the shooter's ears.|$|R
50|$|The Pro-Am {{is an open}} bolt {{semi-automatic}} marker. Early models had {{cast metal}} foregrips and pistol grips (the Pro-Am), while later models had composite foregrips and grip frames (the Pro-Lite). The loader connection was built into the foregrip, and by clicking the foregrip forward with a sear {{at the front of}} the gun the paint was kept from feeding, and the breech became open to clean the gun with a pull through squeegee. This allowed a player to clean the gun really fast with a pull through squeegee, without removing the barrel, or removing the loader. Like all Tippmann markers the Pro-Am was nearly indestructible and extremely reliable gun. While the Pro-am was like the 68 Special in layout, being an inline poppet valve design, it was a major change in design, with a different body, valve, breech, <b>hammer,</b> <b>hammer</b> to <b>bolt</b> linkage, and sear arrangements. Also the tank was moved to below the grip frame for better balance and to allow different bottom line arrangements and stocks, instead of the Lone Star (M-16 style) grip that had been on the previous Tippmann Semi/Full Auto lines. Also it was the first Tippmann Semi-Auto that didn't require a siphon tank to run liquid , even though it could in colder weather without any problems.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} activity report is mainly {{based on the}} last 14 years work for understanding and modeling the nonlinear mechanical behavior of aeronautical composite materials. Being initiated during my PhD, this work is an extent of it, oriented {{to the analysis of}} damage phenomena (initiation and propagation) under static or rapid dynamic loadings for a broad range of composite materials such as short fibers composites, unidirectional composites, and woven composites, with thermoplastic or thermoset matrix. The most relevant developed material models are presented {{in the first part of}} this work, as well as a proposed identification methodology and methods that can be used to demonstrate the models' robustness. The second and last part of this work gives a general overview of industrial applications of these developments, in three fields: - forecast of defects during and after drilling process, - interaction between drillings defects and <b>hammering</b> behavior of <b>bolted</b> joints, - forecast of defects during and after low velocity impacts. ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph of {{the cross}} on Mount Rubidoux summit, Riverside, [s. d. ]. Steps, made of stones (or bricks?), lead up to the cross that is {{standing}} on a large boulder. The cross is made of two wooden beams held together by two metallic(?) bars bolted to the beams. A type of rope or leather material is fastened around the intersections {{of the cross}}. A plaque, <b>hammered</b> or <b>bolted</b> into the boulder on which the cross stands, reads: "FPA. Junipero Serra, 1713 - 1784, dedicated April 26, 19 [ [...] . ] 7, by [ [...] . ]". Agricultural grids of land and mountains of Riverside County are visible in the distance.; "This natural mountain area has an excellent City view as it towers approximately 1300 feet above sea level. It is the highest point in downtown Riverside {{and it has a}} popular hiking trail, which offers a spectacular 360 -degree view of Riverside. It also has upon it, the Mt. Rubidoux Peace Tower that was built in 1925 to promote world peace and was dedicated to Frank Miller. Before it was purchased and developed, the Cahuilla and Serrano people lived {{at the base of the}} mountain near the thriving Santa Ana River. Frank Miller bought the mountain in 1906 and built a narrow, winding road leading to a huge cross on the summit. This cross, erected in 1907, was dedicated to local missionary Father Junipero Serra, and two years later was home to the nations first Easter sunrise service. In 1993, the road was closed to vehicle traffic, much to the satisfaction of locals of Riverside. " [...] unknown author...|$|R
50|$|The term Nelson-based {{lends itself}} from the Nelson Paint Company and its first marker, the Nel-Spot 007. The basic valve design found in these early markers {{laid the groundwork for}} many other {{manufacturers}} to develop their own paintball guns. The Nelson design is in-line which means that the <b>bolt,</b> <b>hammer,</b> and valve follow the barrel and form a line as opposed to being stacked. It fires from a closed bolt position meaning that when it fires the bolt is secured into the breech end of the barrel with a paintball loaded. In comparison, the bolt in an open bolt marker is not secured until the marker fires, at which point the paintball is chambered, fired, and the bolt is then re-opened. Another characteristic of the Phantom that varies within the Nelson-based family of markers is that it features the original breech drop design as opposed to the bore drop variation of the design, meaning that the paintballs drop into breech, or rear of the barrel, rather than dropping into the bore of the barrel.|$|R
2500|$|The major {{activity}} {{for the day}} was mission's first spacewalk (EVA 1) by astronauts Foreman and Satcher. Foreman, the lead spacewalker wore a suit with solid red stripes while Satcher wore an all-white spacesuit. Inside the space station Atlantis Mission Specialist Randolph Bresnik choreographed the activities and coordinated communications between the spacewalkers and Mission Control. Since Foreman and Satcher completed their chores nearly two hours ahead of schedule, planners decided to add a [...] "get ahead" [...] task; Satcher to lubricate the Kibo robotic arm snares while Foreman to route a LAN cable on Zarya and mate power cables on a patch panel at the S0 truss. Towards the end of EVA 1, while deploying the Payload Attach System (PAS) on the Earth-facing side of the Starboard 3 truss, the crew had difficulty loosening a bolt and removing a diagonal brace on the PAS. After <b>hammering</b> on a <b>bolt</b> and wiggling the brace, they successfully deployed the PAS and reinstalled the brace. The spacewalk marked: 228th spacewalk conducted by U.S. astronauts, the 134th in support of space station assembly and maintenance, 106th spacewalk out of the space station, the fourth for Foreman and the first for Satcher.|$|R
50|$|Compressed gas {{enters the}} valve of the Phantom, {{pressing}} the cup seal assembly against the retainer with the aide of the valve spring. This gas forces the valve to stay sealed {{and allows the}} gun to be cocked which prepares the hammer of the paintball marker for firing. Without {{the pressure of the}} gas in the valve the gun cannot be cocked. As indicated by the term pump action the first step in firing the marker is the pump stroke which uses the rod connecting the pump handle and bolt to cock the marker. The pump stroke consists of two parts; the backward pump stroke and the forward pump stroke. On the backward pump stroke the bolt moves back, compressing the main spring until the <b>bolt</b> and <b>hammer</b> are connected by the sear. At this time a single ball drops into the breech. Next, during the forward pump stroke, both the <b>bolt</b> and <b>hammer</b> move forward, chambering the paintball sealing the breech. Next, as the trigger is pulled, the sear pivots and releases the <b>hammer</b> from the <b>bolt.</b> The compressed main spring forces the hammer back until it reaches the rear of the power tube and provides enough energy to force the power tube back. As the power tube is pushed back the valve opens and compressed gas flows through the power tube and the tuned port compensator (TPC), projecting the paintball out of the barrel.|$|R
60|$|When {{dawn was}} come all those {{starving}} peasants {{may well have}} stood before the high impregnable walls in the broad daylight of despair. Even their nightmares during the night, of unearthly necromancers looking down at them from the battlements and with signs and spells paralysing all their potential toils, {{may well have been}} a sort of pessimistic consolation, anticipating and accounting for failure. The Holy City had become for them a fortress full of fiends, when Godfrey de Bouillon again set himself sword in hand upon the wooden tower and gave the order once more to drag it tottering towards the towers {{on either side of the}} postern gate. So they crawled again across the fosse full of the slain, dragging their huge house of timber behind them, and all the blast and din of war broke again about their heads. A hail of <b>bolts</b> <b>hammered</b> such shields as covered them for a canopy, stones and rocks fell on them and crushed them like flies in the mire, and from the engines of the Greek Fire all the torrents of their torment came down on them like red rivers of hell. For indeed the souls of those peasants must have been sickened with something of the topsy-turvydom felt by too many peasants of our own time under the frightful flying batteries of scientific war; a blasphemy of inverted battle in which hell itself has occupied heaven. Something of the vapours vomited by such cruel chemistry may have mingled with the dust of battle, and darkened such light as showed where shattering rocks were rending a roof of shields, to men bowed and blinded as they are by such labour of dragging and such a hailstorm of death. They may have heard through all the racket of nameless noises the high minaret cries of Moslem triumph rising shriller like a wind in shrill pipes, and known little else of what was happening above or beyond them. It was most likely that they laboured and strove in that lower darkness, not knowing that high over their heads, and up above the cloud of battle, the tower of timber and the tower of stone had touched and met in mid-heaven; and great Godfrey, alone and alive, had leapt upon the wall of Jerusalem.|$|R
