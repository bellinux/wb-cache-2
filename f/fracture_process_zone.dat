5000|$|As the {{surfaces}} (known as cohesive surfaces) separate, traction first increases until a maximum is reached, and then subsequently reduces to zero {{which results in}} complete separation. The variation in traction in relation to displacement is plotted on a curve and is called the traction-displacement curve. The area under this curve {{is equal to the}} energy needed for separation.CZM maintains continuity conditions mathematically; despite physical separation. It eliminates singularity of stress and limits it to the cohesive strength of the material. [...] The traction-displacement curve gives the constitutive behavior of the fracture. For each material system, guidelines are to be formed and modelling is done individually. This is how the CZM works. The amount of fracture energy dissipated in the work region depends on the shape of the model considered. Also, the ratio between maximum stress and the yield stress affects the length of <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone.</b> Smaller the ratio, longer is the process zone. The CZM allows the energy to flow into the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone,</b> where a part of it is spent in the forward region and rest in the wake region.|$|E
50|$|In LEFMPA, during cracking, no {{specific}} region is mentioned {{in between the}} area which is cracked and that which is not. But {{it is evident that}} in concrete, there is some intermediate space between cracked and uncracked portion. This region is defined as the <b>Fracture</b> <b>Process</b> <b>Zone</b> (FPZ). FPZ consists of micro cracks which are minute individual cracks situated nearer to crack tip. As the crack propagates these micro cracks merge and becomes a single structure to give continuity to the already existing crack. So indeed, FPZ acts as a bridging zone between cracked region and uncracked region. Analysis of this zone deserves special notice because it is very helpful to predict the propagation of crack and ultimate failure in concrete.In steel (ductile) FPZ is very small and therefore strain hardening dominates over strain softening. Also due to small FPZ, crack tip can easily be distinguished from uncracked metal. And in ductile materials FPZ is a yielding zone.|$|E

5000|$|Zdeněk Bažant’s {{main focus}} is on {{mathematical}} modeling in mechanics of materials and structures. He has {{made significant contributions to}} several important engineering fields. E.g., in 1976 he showed by stability analysis that the concept strain-softening (then regarded by mechanics gurus as “insane”) does make sense if there is a finite material characteristic length that limits strain localization. Then, in 1983, he published a paradigm changing paper on the crack band model, which presented a simple way to handle nonlocal damage and avoid spurious mesh sensitivity. Both papers were hardly cited for two decades but then the citations exploded (even though the 1983 paper was declined in a premier American journal and then published in a French journal little known at that time; the citations of this papers now run several hundred a year and in 2016 exceeded 2600, on Google). The crack band model is now embedded in various commercial programs and is applied in user’s subroutines for concrete, rocks and comosites, and is the mainstay in design of large commercial composite airframes (e.g., at Boeing). [...] It was similar with Bažant’s (by now classical) material models for nonlocal damage, for energetic (non-statistical) size effect in quasibrittle fracture, for microplane constitutive modeling, for a solidifying material model for concrete creep, for calculations of moisture diffusion in nano-pores of concrete, and for his solution of elastic three-dimensional singularities at skew intersections of crack front line with a surface. They all became highly cited only recently. So did. his monumental treatise on stability of structures, innovative in treating the stability of fracture and damage, thermodynamics of structural stability, and objective stress rates for 3D bodies. Ditto his pioneering books on fracture and size effect in concrete, on concrete at high temperatures, and on concrete creep and shrinkage. Bažant is best known as the world leader in scaling research in solid mechanics. Bažant size effect law, with his demonstrations (mainly in six papers during 1976-91) of damage localization instabilitites and of spurious dependence of the early strain-softening models on element size, {{took a long time to}} sink in. But eventually it changed the design computations in concrete and geotechnical industry, and impacted the design practice in fiber composites (for large aircraft, ships and, car crashworthiness). The RILEM standard recommendation for testing of fracture energy and characteristic length of concrete (FMT/1990) is based on Bažant’s law. [...] Later Bažant extended his scaling research to statistical size effect. Exploiting the frequency law of interatomic bond breaks, he showed that, due to <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> finiteness, the statistical strength of quasibrittle structures follows a graft of Gauss and Weibull distributions and exhibits a strong size effect, causing the safety factors and static and fatigue lifetimes of quasibrittle structures to be size dependent. He demonstrated that disregard of size effect was a major factor in many structural failures. His proposals of code provisions taking into account the size effect on shear failures of beams and slabs has been endorsed by ACI Committee 446 but not yet accepted for the ACI concrete design code. [...] Bažant’s microplane model for softening damage in concrete, rocks, composites, etc., in which the constitutive law is written in terms of stress and strain vectors on a generic plane, trades conceptual simplicity and clarity of physical interpretation for higher computational demands, which initially stifled applications but recently ceased to be an obstacle. The microplane model is now included in large-scale computer codes at U.S. national labs (EPIC, PRONTO, etc.) and in various commercial codes (ATENA, DIANA, SBETA, OOFEM). His microplane model for jointed rock is embedded, e.g., in ANSYS. With the microplane model, Bažant was able to capture the `vertex’ effect in softening damage, which is important for dynamics but cannot be simulated with the classical tensorial constitutive models (for concrete he also demonstrated by tests). He showed experimentally and theoretically that material strain softening reverses to hardening when the loading rate suddenly increases. [...] Bažant further made major theoretical and experimental contributions to the sustainability problems of infrastructure, to high temperature effects in nuclear containments and in tunnels exposed to fire, to thermodynamics and nano-mechanics of creep and shrinkage in hydrating cement, and to 3D singularities at fracture surface intersections. His Model B3 for practical prediction of concrete creep and shrinkage, calibrated by a worldwide database of thousands of laboratory tests assembled by his assistants, became an international standard recommendation (RILEM-CGS/1991). His nonlinear diffusion model for concrete is featured in Eurocode and widely used in durability analysis. His simple age-adjusted effective modulus method for concrete structure taking into account multi-decade chemical aging is embedded in the Eurocode as well as ACI standard recommendation. His unconditionally stable ‘exponential’ algorithm for rate-type concrete creep law is now standard in structural computations. [...] In finite strain theory and structural stability analysis, Bažant was the first to resolve the decades-old controversy about the 3D stability theories of Engesser, Haringx, Hencky, Truesdell, Biot, etc., as applied to soft-in-shear structures. In 1971, he showed by energy variational analysis that these theories correspond to different choices of objective stress rate and are all equivalent upon certain transformations of the tangential elastic moduli, and that some objective stress rates used in Abaqus, Ansys, LS-Dyna and other commercial codes do not conserve energy. This 1971 result was generally ignored until, a few years ago, Bažant demonstrated that the energy conservation error is non-negligible and can be of the order of 100% in the case of highly orthotropic structures, orthotropic damage, or high compressibility. Furthermore, he provided a coherent mechanical explanation of the collapse of WTC Towers in New York, and then derived the crush-down and crush-up differential equations of progressive collapse of tall buildings. [...] Bažant also developed a theory of the destructive alkali-silica reaction (ASR) in concrete (including the diffusion of expanding gel) which matches test results; a theory on hundred year prediction of concrete creep based on inverse analysis of observed excessive bridge deflections, coupled with Bayesian extrapolation of short-time test data; and predictions models B3 and B4 for concrete creep and shrinkage (both drying and chemical-autogenous) which became standard international recommendations of RILEM. He also formulated new theory chemical aging due to cement hydration from hours to centuries at variable temperature and humidity, and a theory for of microprestress (eigenstress) in hydrated cement originating from disjoining pressures of hindered adsorbed water in nanopores. He extended his probabilistic theory of quasibrittle failure to the size effect on residual strength and lifetime, and on Paris law the cyclic crack growths in quasibrittle materials, and showed an analosy with dielectric breakdown. He demonstrated his non-statistical size effect for the fracture of bones and of dental materials. [...] Recently, with his motivated group of assistants, Bažant works on stability and propagation of hydraulic fracture in gas or oil shale and mitigation of environmental risks of fracking; on size effect in fatigue crack growth in quasibrittle materials; and on energy absorption in composite crush cans for cars. Considering the body forces do to water diffusing into shale pores, he showed that hydraulic fracture must branch laterally, and determined their spacing inversely, based on gas production observations. He formulated a new theory of comminution of solids under impact due to release of kinetic energy of high-rate shearing, analogous to turbulence. He examined critically the new theory of ‘peridynamics’ and showed its limitations. Bažant strives in his contributions for practical relevance, originality, clarity and mathematical simplicity. Despite engaging in some super-computer simulations, he prefers analytical approaches as a way to reach deeper understanding, even at the cost of inevitable simplifications. At the same time, he has always extensively validated his results by experimental data and, when facing a vacuum of experimental evidence, conducted a host of innovative experiments with his own research team. [...] By 2016, Bažant’s H-index reached 112, i10-index 550 and his total citations 54,000 (on Google Scholar, incl. self-cit.).|$|E

40|$|Abstract Concrete is a {{so called}} quasi-brittle {{material}} which, despite predominantly elastic material response, exhibits in tension loading a stable non-linear fracture response, when tested under displacement control. The {{reason for the}} non-linearity {{is the development of}} a <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone,</b> in front of the crack, due to micro-cracking and crack bridging. It has become increasingly popular to model the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> with different cohesive zone models. However, their use requires sophisticated finite element modeling and their success {{is directly related to the}} correctness of the assumed stress relaxation in the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone.</b> An alternative is to use LEFM combined with an effective crack length. The effect of the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> is to make the specimen sense the crack as being longer than a 0 +Δa. The <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> causes thus an effective increase in the crack driving force but also the apparent fracture resistance increases since the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> effectively “blunts ” the crack tip.

40|$|The {{influence}} of specimen back-face boundary on {{the shape and}} size of the crack-tip <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> during crack growth is related to the fracture energy distribution along the crack path.

The reduction in the <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zone</b> height leads to a decreasing specific fracture energy distribution along the crack path in the back-face boundary region.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a {{comprehensive study of}} the cracking and coalescence behavior of granite specimens with pre-existing flaw pairs. Uniaxial compressions tests were conducted on Barre granite with pre-existing flaw pairs of varying inclination angles (β), bridging angles (α) and ligament lengths (L). The cracking processes were recorded using a high speed camera to capture crack initiation and determine the mode (tensile or shear) of cracking. Visible <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zones</b> of grain lightening, referred to as “white patching”, were also observed. White patching corresponded to <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zones</b> that developed before visible cracks appeared. Cracks were typically preceded by a corresponding linear white patching. Diffusive area white patching was also observed near locations where surface spalling eventually occurred. Shear cracks occurred less often {{when compared to other}} brittle materials such as gypsum and marble and tensile cracks were typically much more jagged in shape (saw-toothed) due to the larger size and higher strength mineral grains of granite. Crack coalescence behavior trended from indirect to direct shear and combined shear-tensile to direct tensile coalescence as the flaw pair bridging angle (α) or flaw angle (β) increased. As the ligament length (L) between flaws increased, more indirect coalescence was observed. As expected, due to the increased occurrence of tensile cracking in granite, more indirect tensile coalescence was observed in granite compared to other materials previously studied.

To capture the observed fundamental mechanisms, significantly different from classical continua, a mechanical model based on a strong nonlocal theory is applied in which an intrinsic length reflects a characteristic length of the microstructure. Nonlocal stress and strain tensor fields are estimated by analytical solutions on closed form to a modified inhomogeneous Helmholtz equation using LEFM crack-tip fields as source terms. Justified by experimental observations, physical requirements of finite stresses and strains at infinity and at the tip are applied to remove singularities.

Photomicrographs show evidence in dynamic <b>fracture</b> <b>process</b> <b>zones</b> of discrete debonding around nucleation sites as well as growth and coalescence into through cracks; cf.

In the present study, nonlocal damage models with different averaging procedures are applied to the modelling of fracture in specimens with various boundary types. Firstly, the nonlocal models are calibrated by fitting load–displacement curves and dissipated energy profiles for direct tension to the results of mesoscale analyses performed using a discrete model. These analyses are set up so that the results are independent of boundaries. Then, the models are applied to two-dimensional simulations of three-point bending tests with a sharp notch, a V-type notch, and a smooth boundary without a notch. The performance of the nonlocal approaches in modelling of fracture near nonconvex boundaries is evaluated by comparison of load–displacement curves and dissipated energy profiles along the beam ligament with the results of meso-scale simulations.

The variation of creep stress and the crack-tip governing parameter {{in the form of}} creep In-integral with time and the evolution of creep damage were analyzed by using the FE-model. The effect of the introduced creep stress intensity factor as a function of creep time through the continuum damage mechanics of the creep crack growth are discussed in detail...|$|R
40|$|The present work {{involves}} a numerical modelling of the Embedded <b>Process</b> <b>Zone</b> (EPZ) by utilizing the elastoplastic Mode I and Mode II fracture {{models for the}} simulation of plastically deforming adhesive joints. A traction-separation law was developed separately for Mode I and Mode II. For {{the analysis of the}} mixed-mode <b>fracture</b> <b>processes,</b> the cohesive <b>zones</b> in Mode I and Mode II fracture were assumed uncoupled. The experimental programme involved the fabrication and testing of Double Strap Joints (DSJs) and Single Lap Joints (SLJs). By fitting the numerical results to the experimental ones, the basic cohesive parameters of the problem were defined. © (2010) Trans Tech Publications, Switzerland...|$|R
40|$|An {{understanding}} of response of concrete structures to impact loading {{is of interest}} to the Explosions, Ballistics and Protection department of TNO. Numerical simulations conducted to study this response require very small elements to capture the shockwave propagation and the material response which were found to be mesh dependent. The goal of the thesis is to implement and investigate a nonlocal model to obtain mesh independent results when simulating concrete failure under dynamic loads. The nonlocal models are implemented in LS-DYNA by modifying the user subroutines. The original nonlocal model has certain drawbacks which are investigated by means of certain benchmark tests. The use of the constant length scale and the isotropic weight function is found to be the cause of the drawbacks of the nonlocal model. A modified nonlocal model, the Stress based nonlocal model which resolves the issues of the original nonlocal model is implemented. The stress based nonlocal model is investigated to understand its behavior which leads to the resolution of the drawbacks of the nonlocal model. The stress based nonlocal model provides physically relevant <b>fracture</b> <b>processes.</b> The behavior of the model in a dynamic loading at various loading rates is investigated in comparison to the quasi-static loading. It is found that the model cannot capture the varying <b>fracture</b> <b>processes</b> <b>zone</b> widths as expected with the varying loading rates. The stress based nonlocal model is finally validated with experimental results and mesh independent results are obtained. The model cannot capture the varying <b>fracture</b> <b>processes</b> with different loading rates as seen in experiments. This is due {{to the use of the}} rate independent material model in combination with the stress based nonlocal model behavior.
