5|$|Inlaid {{coloured}} marble {{set into}} both floor and walls especially in church interiors. This {{particular form of}} <b>Intarsia</b> developed in Sicily from the 17th century (see the floor of illustration 14).|$|E
5|$|The Green Room, was frescoed by Giuseppe Castagnoli {{in early}} 19th Century. It {{exhibits}} an <b>Intarsia</b> Cabinet from the 17th {{century and a}} Collection of Gilded Bronzes; the Throne Room was decorated for King Vittorio Emanuele II of Savoy and {{is characterized by the}} red brocate on the walls and by the Japanese and Chinese Vases (17th-18th century).|$|E
5|$|The frescoes {{decorating the}} open arcade {{known as the}} Gallery of Hercules were altered by Rainier III, who {{imported}} works by Pier Francesco Mazzucchelli depicting mythological and legendary heroes. In addition many of the rooms were refurnished and redecorated. Many of the marble floors have been restored in the staterooms and decorated with <b>intarsia</b> designs which include the double R monogram of Prince Rainier III.|$|E
50|$|Several {{valuable}} <b>intarsias</b> by fra Damiano da Bergamo, such as The Story of San Girolomo, and geometrical fugures.|$|R
50|$|The façade has {{the typical}} Pisane stripes of bichrome marble stones, and is {{articulated}} in five arcades with lozenges, <b>intarsias</b> and capitals sculpted by Biduino (late 12th century). The bell tower, which was rebuilt several times, {{dates to the}} 17th century.|$|R
50|$|The {{exterior}} has bichrome marble bands which re-use Roman stones. The façade, {{designed in}} the 12th century, but completed in 14th maybe by Giovanni Pisano, has two corps with pilaster strips, blind arches, marble <b>intarsias</b> and three orders of loggias in the upper section.|$|R
25|$|In 1524 he also painted {{cartoons}} with Old Testament stories, {{as models}} for the <b>intarsia</b> panels for the choir stalls of Santa Maria Maggiore in Bergamo.|$|E
25|$|With {{the decline}} of the {{political}} prestige of the Gabrielli family, Gubbio was thereafter incorporated into the territories of the House of Montefeltro. Federico da Montefeltro rebuilt the ancient Palazzo Ducale, incorporating in it a studiolo veneered with <b>intarsia</b> like his studiolo at Urbino. The maiolica industry at Gubbio reached its apogee {{in the first half of}} the 16th century, with metallic lustre glazes imitating gold and copper.|$|E
25|$|This {{campaign}} was interrupted in 1519 as work was going {{forward by the}} condition of French occupation in Lombardy after the War of the League of Cambrai. French troops were encamped round the Certosa. Notations of work on the facade did not resume until 1554, when a revised design {{under the direction of}} Cristoforo Lombardo was approved for the completion of the facade above the second arcade; there marble <b>intarsia</b> was substituted for the rich sculptual decorations of the lower area. Some final details were added by Galeazzo Alessi.|$|E
5000|$|The altarpiece shows Francesco Gonzaga paying {{homage to}} Mary, {{who sits on}} a high throne {{decorated}} with marbles <b>intarsias</b> and bas-reliefs. The base of the throne, with lion paws, has, within a medallion, the inscription [...] "" [...] (Queen of Heaven, rejoice, Alleluia); it lies on a circular basement with a bas-relief of the [...] "Original Sin" [...] and other stories from the Book of Genesis which are partly obscured by the praying figures. The throne's back has a large solar disc, decorated with weavings and [...] pearls.|$|R
25|$|Church of the Gesu (Church of Jesus): Located in {{the city}} centre, the church was built in 1564 in the late-Renaissance style by the Jesuits. It was built over a {{pre-existing}} convent of Basilian monks. Alterations in 1591 were completed in a Sicilian Baroque. The church was heavily damaged after the 1943 bombings, which destroyed most of the frescos. The interior has a Latin cross plan with a nave and two aisles, and has a particularly rich decoration of marbles, <b>intarsia</b> and stuccoes, especially in St Anne's Chapel. At the right is the Casa Professa, with a 1685 portal and a precious 18th century cloister. The building has been home to the Municipal Library since 1775.|$|E
25|$|The {{pavilion}} {{has been}} completely redecorated, {{and most of the}} Baroque woodwork has been removed. The decorative tiles, reflecting the high quality craftsmanship of the İznik tile industry of the 17th century, were removed in accordance with the original concept and replaced with modern copies. The paintwork of the wooden dome is still original and {{is an example of the}} rich designs of the late 16th/early 17th centuries. The fireplace in the second room has a tall, gilded hood and has been restored to its original appearance. The window shutters next to the fireplace are decorated with nacre <b>intarsia.</b> The windows in coloured glass look out across the high terrace and the garden of the pool below. The spigots in these windows are surrounded with red, black and gold designs.|$|E
25|$|To {{left and}} right of the central door are two {{permanently}} installed fields consisting of upright flat marble slabs inlaid with an unusual <b>Intarsia</b> technique, with geometric and floral motifs cut into the marble in relief. The pictures are from the Arab tradition and are supplemented by small birds, swastikas, flowers, palmettes and leaves. The wells of the reliefs were originally filled with a red, now darkened mass of wax and mastic. In the same technique, marble inlays are also mounted on the pillar trim, connecting panels and the door lintels. Two icons are also embedded above the lintels. On {{the left side of}} the door, the Panagia is depicted with the Child Jesus. To the right of the central door is the Christ Pantocrator with the right hand in a sign of blessing and the left holding a closed Evangelion. These two icons are modern creations which took the place of 17th century icons which were stolen in 1982.|$|E
25|$|The European Sculpture and Decorative Arts {{collection}} {{is one of}} the largest departments at the Met, holding in excess of 50,000 separate pieces from the 15th through the early 20th centuries. Though the {{collection is}} particularly concentrated in Renaissance sculpture—much of which can be seen in situ surrounded by contemporary furnishings and decoration—it also contains comprehensive holdings of furniture, jewelry, glass and ceramic pieces, tapestries, textiles, and timepieces and mathematical instruments. In addition to its outstanding collections of English and French furniture, visitors can enter dozens of completely furnished period rooms, transplanted in their entirety into the Met's galleries. The collection even includes an entire 16th-century patio from the Spanish castle of Vélez Blanco, reconstructed in a two-story gallery, and the <b>intarsia</b> studiolo from the ducal palace at Gubbio. Sculptural highlights of the sprawling department include Bernini's Bacchanal, a cast of Rodin's The Burghers of Calais and several unique pieces by Houdon, including his Bust of Voltaire and his famous portrait of his daughter Sabine.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{demonstrable}} {{reference to}} Emperor Alexios {{in the now}} largely destroyed inscription Ἀλέξιος ἐν Χῶ τῶ Θῶ αὐτοκράτωρ Ρωμαίων ὁ Κομνινὸς καì πιστὸς βασιλεύς (Alexios in Christ the God , autokrator of the Romans, the Komnenos and pious basileus) over {{the inside of the}} main entrance. There is also a fresco with a portrait of the Emperor, which dates from the 16th century and is hence not contemporary, and is moreover badly damaged. There is a debate in the literature about whether the Alexios in question might not be Alexios II Komnenos, who ruled from 1180 until 1183. The motifs in the marble <b>intarsia</b> provide some support for this theory, particularly the representation of birds and the frequent use of crosses are typical of illustrated manuscripts from the time of Alexios II. Evidence to the contrary {{comes from the fact that}} Alexios I demonstrably pursued a program of church building, and that neighbouring islands have churches that have been dated to the time of his rule. Therefore, the foundation of the church before the emperor's death in 1118 is not excluded; various local texts that specify exact dates, are from the 19th century and probably have no factual basis.|$|E
2500|$|After 1774, he also {{designed}} <b>intarsia</b> paintings for cabinet maker David Roentgen.|$|E
2500|$|Weft-knit fabrics {{may also}} be knit with {{multiple}} yarns, usually to produce interesting color patterns. [...] The two most common approaches are <b>intarsia</b> and stranded colorwork. [...] In <b>intarsia,</b> the yarns are used in well-segregated regions, e.g., a red apple on a field of green; in that case, the yarns are kept on separate spools and only one is knitted at any time. [...] In the more complex stranded approach, two or more yarns alternate repeatedly within one row and all the yarns must be carried along the row, as seen in Fair Isle sweaters. Double knitting can produce two separate knitted fabrics simultaneously (e.g., two socks). [...] However, the two fabrics are usually integrated into one, giving it great warmth and excellent drape.|$|E
2500|$|The {{multiplicity}} of the decorations of the iconostasis {{serves as a}} reminder of the traditions of the golden age of Constantinople. They represent an attempt to draw together elements from all Constantinopolitan styles [...] "with a certain nostalgia". This leads to a kind of Neo-Justinianism, but transformed into a characteristically Greek style through the technique of marble <b>intarsia.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Plenty of {{finished}} knitting projects {{never use}} {{more than a}} single color of yarn, but {{there are many ways to}} work in multiple colors. [...] Some yarns are dyed to be either variegated (changing color every few stitches in a random fashion) or self-striping (changing every few rows). More complicated techniques permit large fields of color (<b>intarsia,</b> for example), busy small-scale patterns of color (such as Fair Isle), or both (double knitting and slip-stitch color, for example).|$|E
2500|$|In Venice, Lotto first resided at the Dominican monastery of Santi Giovanni e Paolo, but he {{was forced}} [...] to leave {{after a few months}} after a {{conflict}} with <b>intarsia</b> artist Fra Damiano da Bergamo. To cope with the many commissions he started to receive, he founded a workshop. He shipped five altarpieces for churches in the Marches and another one for the church Santa Maria Assunta in Celano (near Bergamo). Another altarpiece was for the Venetian church of Santa Maria dei Carmini, portraying St. Nicholas of Bari in Glory.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are several}} {{techniques}} to execute <b>intarsia</b> when circular knitting. Executing <b>intarsia</b> [...] "in-the-round" [...] {{eliminates the need}} for seams and, in one case, turning the piece and working from the wrong side. Priscilla Gibson-Roberts discusses four techniques for knitting <b>intarsia</b> in the round in her book, Ethnic Socks & Stockings.|$|E
50|$|Mosaics have a {{distinctly}} different appearance than <b>intarsia</b> or marquetry. <b>Intarsia</b> and marquetry can appear very similar, but marquetry {{is much more}} common when semiprecious, or precious materials are being used.|$|E
50|$|When Egypt {{came under}} Arab {{rule in the}} seventh century, {{indigenous}} arts of <b>intarsia</b> and wood inlay, which lent themselves to non-representational decors and tiling patterns, spread throughout the maghreb. The technique of <b>intarsia</b> was already perfected in Islamic North Africa before it was introduced into Christian Europe through Sicily and Andalusia. The art was further developed in Siena and by Sienese masters at the cathedral of Orvieto, where figurative <b>intarsia</b> made their first appearance, ca 1330 and continuing into the 15th century and in northern Italy in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries, spreading to German centers and introduced into London by Flemish craftsmen in the later sixteenth century. The most elaborate examples of <b>intarsia</b> {{can be found in}} cabinets of this period, which were items of great luxury and prestige. After about 1620, marquetry tended to supplant <b>intarsia</b> in urbane cabinet work.|$|E
5000|$|In the 1980s, <b>intarsia</b> {{began to}} gain {{popularity}} in the United States as a technique for creating wooden art using a band saw or scroll saw. [...] Early practitioners made money both by selling their art, and also selling patterns used to create <b>intarsia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Common {{examples}} of <b>intarsia</b> include sweaters with large, solid-colour features like fruits, flowers, or geometric shapes. Argyle socks and sweaters are normally done in <b>intarsia,</b> although the thin diagonal lines are often overlaid {{in a later}} step, using Swiss darning or sometimes just a simple backstitch.|$|E

5000|$|Lath art {{has a lot}} {{in common}} with {{marquetry}} and <b>intarsia.</b> They are all woodworking hobbies to make pictures out of sections of wood, but marquetry and <b>intarsia</b> use the wood grain as a design element, and lath art uses the direction of the lath stick and the colors of the stains as a design element.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike other {{multicolour}} techniques (including Fair Isle, slip-stitch colour, {{and double}} knitting), {{there is only}} one [...] "active" [...] colour on any given stitch, and yarn is not carried across the back of the work; when a colour changes on a given row, the old yarn is left hanging. This means that any <b>intarsia</b> piece is topologically several disjoint columns of colour; a simple blue circle on a white background involves one column of blue and two of white—one for the left and one for the right. <b>Intarsia</b> is most often worked flat, rather than in the round. However, it is possible to knit <b>intarsia</b> in circular knitting using particular techniques.|$|E

50|$|He {{explored}} {{other techniques}} as well, like embedding molten metal in wood objects. In {{the fall of}} 1956 Tidemand-Johannessen exhibited a group of work in <b>intarsia</b> at Norway Design in Oslo.

This exhibition received a favorable review from Bonytt, an established Norwegian magazine of arts and interior design.|$|E
