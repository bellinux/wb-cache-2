50|$|A {{breaker bar}} {{is a long}} non-ratcheting bar that is used with <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> style <b>sockets.</b> Breaker bars are used to break loose very tight {{fasteners}} because their additional length allows {{the same amount of}} force to generate significantly more torque than a standard length <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> The use of a breaker bar also prevents damage to the ratcheting mechanism of a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> Often, after the first 1/2 turn of a fastener, the fastener is then loose enough to be turned with a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b>|$|R

5000|$|A socket is {{typically}} a cylinder {{which has a}} female six- or twelve-point recessed opening sized to fit over the common male hexagonal head of a bolt or nut fastener. The {{opposite end of the}} <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> has a standardized (ANSI B107, ISO, or other consensus standard) square recess to accept the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> drive size. Male drivers are also produced for use with socket head cap screws, and are often called Allen drivers (trademark) or the generic term male bit drivers ...|$|R
5000|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> {{with the}} correct type of socket, {{can be used to}} loosen or tighten a large variety of {{fasteners}} with lower cost, greater ease and often more torque than can be applied with a screwdriver handle. A common use of these different [...] "screw" [...] head type sockets is to attach to power versions of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> (impact <b>sockets)</b> which allow the fasteners to be loosened or tightened much faster and more powerfully than can be done by hand.|$|R

5000|$|Williams {{returned}} with a tire iron and a <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> the latter of which he gave to Draper. Draper, seemingly having second thoughts, urged Williams to leave. Williams replied, [...] "I know what I'm doin, I know what I'm doin. Don't worry about it, I know what I'm doin." [...] He then began battering Norwood's head with the tire iron. When he noticed that Draper was frozen in place, Williams said, [...] "Man, you with me? We {{got to do this}} together." [...] Draper then sprung into action himself, striking Norwood repeatedly with the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench.</b> This violent scene continued until Norwood lay motionless and dead." ...|$|R
5000|$|Specialized [...] "wobble" [...] or swivel sockets {{are made}} {{that have a}} {{separate}} socket head and <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> connection that allows the socket to wobble or swivel over a limited range independent of the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> or tool position when it {{is attached to the}} bolt or nut. This may be a distinct advantage in some applications with restricted access. These [...] "wobble/swivel" [...] sockets, with their typical ball and socket joint swivel attachments, are made {{in a wide variety of}} types and sizes including deep, shallow, impact, triple square. They are often found in impact sets since they can be built sturdier than a common universal joint socket.|$|R
50|$|Using {{the spin}} disk {{will be much}} quicker than using the <b>socket</b> <b>wrench's</b> handle, {{especially}} if its range of motion is limited. If the nut is very loose, just using ones fingers {{may be the best}} option.|$|R

50|$|The most {{prevalent}} form is the ratcheting <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> often improperly called a ratchet. A ratcheting <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> is the device within a hand tool {{in which a}} metal handle {{is attached to a}} ratcheting mechanism, which attaches to a socket, which in turn fits onto a type of bolt or nut. Pulled or pushed in one direction, the ratchet loosens or tightens the bolt or nut attached to the socket. Turned the other direction, the ratchet does not turn the socket but allows the ratchet handle to be re-positioned for another turn while staying attached to the bolt or nut. This ratcheting action allows the fastener to be rapidly tightened or loosened in small increments without disconnecting the tool from the fastener. A switch is built into the ratchet head that allows the user to apply the ratcheting action in either direction, as needed, to tighten or loosen a fastener. Other common methods of driving <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> include pneumatic impact wrenches, hydraulic torque wrenches, torque multipliers and breaker bars. Some lesser known hybrid drivers include striking wrench tools with square drive, and hydraulic impact wrenches (typically powered by on site hydraulic power such as present with military tanks, and many rail car applications).|$|R

50|$|<b>Socket</b> <b>wrench</b> showcases in unique sizes. There's a great {{demand for}} impact <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> across the world. The {{ordinary}} man needs them to repair, assemble or maintain equipment. The US Department of Defense and the US Department of Energy need them, {{as well as}} the Army Corps of Engineers. The global Aerospace community and large industries such as electric power generation, chemical production and mining also need them. Rail car operators need them, as do owners of large equipment with special shapes or unusual sizes and depths. This is exactly where IMPERIAL-Newton Corporation comes in. The company manufactures a uniquely and purposefully large and diverse range of shapes, alloys, sizes and depths of impact sockets which are unique in the marketplace of tools; and intended strictly for industrial usage.|$|R

25|$|A <b>socket</b> <b>wrench,</b> more {{commonly}} referred to as a ratchet, is a type of wrench, or tightening tool, that uses separate, removable sockets to fit many different sizes of fittings and fasteners, most commonly nuts and bolts.

25|$|A {{torque wrench}} {{is a tool}} used to {{precisely}} apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut or bolt.

50|$|A tuning wrench (also {{called a}} tuning lever or tuning hammer) is a {{specialized}} <b>socket</b> <b>wrench</b> used to tune string instruments {{such as the}} piano, harp, and hammer dulcimer, that have strings wrapped around tuning pins. Other string instruments do not require a tuning wrench because their tuning pins or pegs come with handles (as with the violin), or geared tuning machines (as with the guitar or banjo).|$|R
50|$|Tools, such as hooks or <b>socket</b> <b>wrenches</b> can {{be mounted}} {{at the end}} of the pole. More {{sophisticated}} poles can accept pneumatically or hydraulically driven power tools which allow, for example, bolts to be unscrewed remotely. A rotary wire brush allows a terminal to be scoured clean before a connection is made. However, a worker's dexterity is naturally reduced when operating tools {{at the end of}} a pole that is several metres long.|$|R
