40|$|Background: Health related {{quality of}} life (HRQL) {{measures}} are becoming increasingly used in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> health care interventions. They allow us to better understand <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> disease on a patient's life {{as a whole and}} to incorporate the patient's perspective in clinical decision making and in <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> health care. A number of studies have explored <b>the</b> HRQL <b>of</b> people with stroke. Still, due to a number of conceptual and methodological issues, there is no clear understanding <b>of</b> <b>the</b> HRQL <b>of</b> a stroke subgroup: people with aphasia. Aims: <b>The</b> broad aim <b>of</b> this research was to explore <b>the</b> HRQL <b>of</b> people with chronic aphasia following stroke in a way that could be replicated in clinical practice. Thus, a single stroke-specific scale (the SS-QOL) was chosen for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> HRQL. <b>The</b> specific research questions that were addressed were: A) Can an acceptable, reliable and valid version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-QOL be developed for people with chronic aphasia? This involved: i) development of an aphasia-adapted version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-QOL and ii) evaluation of its psychometric properties. B) What are <b>the</b> predictors <b>of</b> HRQL in people with chronic aphasia, as measured by the aphasia adapted version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-QOL? Methods: <b>The</b> development <b>of</b> an aphasia-adapted version <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-QOL involved consultation with professionals with experience in measure development, language and aphasia, and pilot testing for <b>the</b> modification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> instrument, and a pre-test <b>of</b> <b>the</b> adapted version with 18 people with aphasia. This process resulted in the Stroke and Aphasia Quality of Life Scale (SAQOL). A cross-sectional interview-based survey study was undertaken to evaluate the psychometric properties (acceptability, reliability and validity) <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAQOL and to determine <b>the</b> predictors <b>of</b> HRQL as measured by the SAQOL. Convenience sampling was used in the pilot and pre-test studies and cluster sampling in the survey study. Measures: HRQL was measured with the SAQOL. In <b>the</b> construct validation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SAQOL, the following measures were used: for emotional distress the GHQ- 12, for cognition the RCPM, for activities the FAI, for social support the SSS and for language the FAST and the ASHA-FACS. Potential predictors of HRQL included demographic, stroke-related variables and variables implicated in previous research or of theoretical interest measured with the following instruments: the GHQ- 12, the FAI, the SSS, the ASHA-FACS, the RCPh 1 and the PSI (patients' satisfaction with stroke care). Results A) i) Development <b>of</b> an aphasia-adaptedv <b>ersion</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> SS-QOL resulted in the SAQOL, an interview administered self-report measure. People with moderate or mild receptive aphasia (as determined by a score of >_ 7 in <b>the</b> receptive domains <b>of</b> <b>the</b> FAST) found the SAQOL acceptable and were able to self-report to it. A) ii) Psychometric evaluation: 83 out of 95 participants self-reported on the SAQOL. The results supported the reliability and <b>the</b> validity <b>of</b> <b>the</b> overall SAQOL, but not of its subdomains' structure. A shorter 39 -item version was derived through factor analysis (SAQOL- 39). This instrument had a stable, conceptually clear 4 -factor structure (physical, psychosocial, communication and energy) and high acceptability, internal consistency [scale(a=. 93) and subdomains' (a=. 74 -. 94) ], test-retest reliability [scale (ICC=. 98) and subdomains' (ICC=. 89 -. 98) ] and construct validity [corrected domain-total correlations (r=. 38 -. 58), subdomains' convergent (r=. 55 -. 67) and discriminant (r=. 02 -. 27), and scale's discriminant (r=. 19 -. 31) and correlated measures (r=. 45 -. 58) ]. B) Predictors of HRQL: High emotional distress, reduced involvement in home and outdoors activities, high communication disability and >_ 2 comorbid conditions predicted poorer HRQL (adjusted R 2 =. 52). Stroke type (infarct vs haemorrhage) and demographic variables (age, gender, ethnicity, marital status, employment status and socioeconomic status) were not significant predictors of HRQL in these participants. Conclusions:The SAQOL- 39 is an acceptable, reliable and valid measure for <b>the</b> assessment <b>of</b> HRQL in people with chronic aphasia. Further testing is needed to establish <b>the</b> usability <b>of</b> this measure in evaluative research and routine clinical practice. Poor HRQL is predicted by distress, reduced involvement in activities, communication disability and comorbidity.

It uses linguistic translation as both the subject and the method to make multimedia artworks (text, sound, performance and events) that examine and analyse the translation process itself. The research has been conducted from my own subjective position, as an artist and monolingual speaker (a translation user rather than translation professional), investigating translation as a dialogic, subjective, embodied and performative phenomena. It adopts a self-reflexive methodology that places equal value in theoretical and experiential knowledge and proposes that an artist-led inquiry challenges assumptions, translation protocols, conventions and normative behaviour. The artists and artworks discussed in the thesis examine the translators /translation s agency and its linguistic performativity; exploiting it s creative potential as an artistic process/medium and amplifying its pivotal role within the expanding global art world. This transdisciplinary approach has resulted in <b>the</b> creation <b>of</b> translation zones - works and events devised to engage monolingual and multilingual individuals, professional translators, practitioners and public(s) in <b>the</b> process <b>of</b> translation - that offer an alternative perspective on translation (to research carried out within Translation Studies).

40|$|Adaptive Polar Sampling (APS) is {{proposed}} as a Markov chain Monte Carlo method for Bayesian analysis of models with ill-behaved posterior distributions. In order to sample e#cientlyfrom such a distribution, location-scale transformation and a transformation to polar coordinates are used. After the transformation to polar coordinates, a MetropolisHastings algorithm {{is applied to}} sample directions and, conditionallyon these, distances are generated byinverting the CDF. A sequential procedure is applied to update the location and scale. Tested {{on a set of}} canonical models that feature near non-identifiability, strong correlation, and bimodality, APS compares favourably with the standard Metropolis-Hastings sampler in terms of parsimonyand robustness. APS is applied within a Bayesian analysis of a GARCH-mixture model which is used for <b>the</b> evaluation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Value-at-Risk <b>of</b> <b>the</b> return <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Dow Jones stock index.

Therefore, <b>the</b> aim <b>of</b> {{this study was to}} investigate <b>the</b> impact <b>of</b> aerobic exercises and weight-loss diet on serum follistatin level in inactive middle-aged women. Methods: 39 women with an average age of 39. 43 ± 3. 6 were randomly divided into four experimental groups including: aerobic, step-by-step weight loss diet(n= 10), aerobics followed by step-by-step weight loss diet (n= 10) and low calorie weight lose(n= 10). During eight weeks: the aerobic group exercised three days a week, the step-by-step weight loss group lowered the calorie intake by 20 - 40 % gradually, the third group did aerobic exercise simultaneously keeping step-by-step weight loss diet three times a week, and the fourth group performed their plan by lowering the calorie intake by 40 % in a steady way. Moreover, the study variables were measured before and after the interventionand, the study data were statistically analyzed utilizing paired samples t-test and one-way Anova test. Results: Serum Follistatin levels significantly increased(p< 0. 05) in <b>the</b> groups <b>of</b> aerobics(1. 86 ± 0. 17, 1. 67 ± 0. 18), step-by-step weight lose diet(1. 6 ± 0. 17, 1. 5 ± 0. 21), and aerobics+ step-by-step diet(1. 7 ± 0. 15, 1. 55 ± 0. 17), respectively, whereas in the low calorie group, <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> serum follistatin(1. 36 ± 0. 11, 1. 47 ± 0. 16) significantly decreased(p< 0. 05). conclusion: <b>The</b> method <b>of</b> aerobic excercise along with the step-by-step diet can lead to achieving a healthy weight loss by increasing follistatin level and stimulating <b>the</b> catabolic process <b>of</b> body fal mass.

40|$|Multiferroics exhibit <b>the</b> unusual {{combination}} <b>of</b> ferro/Antiferro {{electricity and}} ferro/Antiferro magnetism {{in the single}} phase material. Multiferroics {{are known to be}} potential candidate for various applications such as memory, data storage, sensors etc. Rare earth orthochromites (RCrO 3) are interesting group of compounds that were studied in search of multiferroic features in recent years. Some of them possess a structural heterogeneity at local scale which is crucial for the observed macroscopic electrical properties such as dielectric and ferroelectric hysteresis behavior. The Neutron diffraction and phonon studies on RCrO 3 confirm the structural distortions whi ch lead to non - centrosymmetry at local scale irrespective of possessing a global /average orthorhombic (i. e. centrosymmetric) structure. The pyroelectric measurements on RCrO 3 ceramics confirm structure - electrical property correlation at magnetic ordering temperature. The essential point to be noted is that such local non - centrosymmetry or the structural heterogeneity in chromites is due to presence of magnetic rare earth and its interaction with Cr 3 + ion. Thus the nonmagnetic rare earth in RCrO 3 leads to non - ferroelectric conclusion i. e. local structural distortions are absent in such chromites as observed from pyroelectric measurements. However the neutron and phonon studies on YCrO 3 (Y - nonmagnetic) exhibits the structural distortions a s well as hysterisis loops indicative of existence of ferroelectricity. It is worth to remember that RCrO 3 samples are associated with high dc - leakage currents which inhibit the polarization hysteresis loops irrespective of magnetic or nonmagnetic nature o f R - ion. Hence, the structural studies give more insight on inherent structural distortions rather than electrical studies on RCrO 3 samples, where electrical measurements mislead <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> possible ferroelectricity. Several structural studies are ca rried out such as Neutron diffraction; Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and Phonon scattering to understand local structural distortions in RCrO 3 samples. Neutron studies confirm <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> global Pnma orthorhombic (centrosymmetric) and local P 2 1 monoclinc (non - centrosymmetric) structure at different temperatures. Phonon studies revealed <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> spin - phonon coupling (R - ion is magnetic) and magnetostriction (R - ion is non - magnetic) in RCrO 3 samples. The Pyroelectric and phonon studies at magnetic ordering temperature indicate that nonmagnetic R - ion is unlikely to exhibit polar behavior. However, the local non centrosymmetry is observed from neutron studies on nonmagnetic Y - ion in YCrO 3 (YCO) raises a question that whether such local structu ral changes are really associated with magnetic nature of R - ion? In literature, there are no extensive studies related to phonon studies on nonmagnetic rare earth RCrO 3 which can rule out possible polar nature in these samples. Hence, the detailed investigations on phonon studies are carried out in nonmagnetic rare earth RCrO 3 sample i. e. YCrO 3 (YCO). vii YCO possess a global orthorhombic structure with Pnma space group at RT observed from neutron and x - ray diffraction measurements. YCO ex hibits the antiferromagnetic phase transition (T N 140 K), as well as ferroelectric curie transition temperature (T c) around 473 K, reveals <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> multiferroic nature. <b>The</b> weak ferroelectric nature of YCO understood from the dielectric and hysteresis behavior at RT and the magnetic transition in YCO is due to <b>the</b> presence <b>of</b> Cr 3 + ion. High temperature x - ray diffraction studies reveal that the global Pnma orthorhombic structure throughout the measured temperature range. Thus diffraction studies did not reveal global structural changes with temperature but involve minor changes in lattice parameters and volume. In order to understand the local structural changes in YCO, phonon studies were performed across the dielectric p hase transition temperature (i. e. 303 - 573 K). From phonon studies, the Raman active B 3 g (3) (out - of - phase O 2 scissor like) mode (SM) showed anomalous behavior with temperature. The phonon mode B 3 g (3) softens across the proposed ferroelectric to paraelectric transition temperature and hardens while at low temperatures. The experime ntal results on disappearance of B 3 g (3) mode with temperature reveal that it is not merely from the volume expansion effect but du e to inherent order – disorder process within YCO i. e. possibl e local structural distortions. To get into deeper insights of microscopic origin, Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed. The combined experimental and DFT studies reveal tha t disappearance of Raman active B 3 g (3) mode above the dielectric transition temperature is due to <b>the</b> transformation <b>of</b> B 3 g (3) (out of phase O 2 scissors like motion) into Raman inactive mode of B 1 u symmetry. The change in B 3 g (3) symmetry is associated w ith the local structural distortions such as Y - displacement along with octahedra distortions in <b>the</b> unit cell <b>of</b> YCO. Our calculations also suggest that the isolated and anomalous behavior of this B 3 g (3) mode at lower temperatures could be due to <b>the</b> conv <b>ersion</b> <b>of</b> scissor mode to anti - stretching mode at extreme Y cation displacement. Further to confirm the Y - displacement effect, we replaced the Y - site with Bismuth and compared the composition dependent phonon studies with temperature dependent phonon studi es. The observed intensity behavior of B 3 g (3) indicates that replacement of Y - site by a small amount <b>of</b> Bismuth exhibit <b>the</b> similar effect <b>of</b> temperature dependent YCO. The composition dependent Raman shift of B 3 g (3) from 486 (x= 0) to 479 cm - 1 (x= 0. 15) is comparable to the 486 (303 K) to 479 cm - 1 (523 K) in temperature dependent YCO. These inherent distortions are seen as a change in morphology with the composition which is direct experimental confirmation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> local structural distortions pres ent in YCO and is indeed due to Y - site distortions/displacements observed from phonon studies. Hence, <b>the</b> out <b>of</b> phase scissor like B 3 g (3) mode seems to {{play a crucial role in}} <b>the</b> polar nature <b>of</b> YCO ceramics. Magnetic and optical properties were studied to understand <b>the</b> influence <b>of</b> structural distortions on magnetic rare earth chromite, Nd 1 - x Bi x CrO 3 (NBiCO) as well as nonmagnetic rare earth chromite, Y 1 - viii x Bi x CrO 3 (YBiCO) ceramics.
