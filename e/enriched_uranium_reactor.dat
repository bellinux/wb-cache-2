Based {{on the relationship between}} the effective multiplication factor and the reactivity, the equation e̱ṯa̱eff =dk/Δh̊o̊ is derived.

PROSPECT, the Precision Reactor Oscillation Spectrum measurement, is designed to make a precision measurement of the antineutrino spectrum from a research reactor and search for signs of an eV-scale sterile neutrino. PROSPECT will be located at the High Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR) at Oak Ridge National Laboratory and make use of a Highly <b>Enriched</b> <b>Uranium</b> <b>reactor</b> for a measurement of the pure U- 235 antineutrino spectrum.

40|$|International audienceThe {{aim of the}} SoLid {{experiment}} is to provide the precise measurement of the anti-neutrino energy spectrum from a highly <b>enriched</b> <b>uranium</b> <b>reactor,</b> and then, perform sensitive search for short baseline neutrino oscillation. The objectives are to resolve the reactor neutrino anomaly and to test in fine the light sterile neutrino hypothesis. For this purpose, the SoLid collaboration are using a novel, highly segmented, composite scintillator detector design to measure the anti-neutrino energy spectrum between 5 and 10 m from a compact reactor core. This project is driven by an international collaboration gathering 11 institutes and about 55 physicists. These measurements will be performed {{over the next five}} years at the BR 2 reactor at SCK-CEN in Mol, Belgium. The collaboration already built and deployed a small 288 kg module of the detector at the BR 2 reactor. Its purpose was to demonstrate the effectiveness of using the detector's novel design in selecting the inverse beta decay events from the high rate of backgrounds events. The detector module was operational during the February 2015 BR 2 reactor cycle. After a short review of the detector design, this talk will present the preliminary results of this successful data taking. It will ended with the presentation of the SoLid Phase I scheduled to begin at the end of this year...|$|E

Special Fissionable Material (SFM) is an international statutory designation used by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to indicate materials bearing uranium enriched above natural in the isotopes uranium- 235, uranium- 233, and plutonium- 239.
