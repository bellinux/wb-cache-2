5|$|The {{following}} day, at the beach, Brody sees a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> that {{approaches the}} swimmers. Thinking it is a shark, he frantically orders everyone {{out of the}} water, and causes a panic by firing his gun. However, the shadow is revealed to be a school of bluefish. His fears are confirmed when he acquires a close-up picture of the shark from the diver's camera. The Amity town council, including local developer Len Peterson, deny the evidence and fire Brody.|$|E
5|$|Stephen Stickler {{acted as}} the band's photographer, and Jay Papke and Dante Ariola {{directed}} the album's cover art and booklet. The cover depicts {{a little girl}} in a purple dress with a matching bow in her blonde hair, bringing her swing to a stop to squint in the sun at the man standing before her. The man is only seen as a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> on the ground, and is holding {{what appears to be a}} horse shoe or, more presumably, blades. The band's logo, a childlike drawing of the band's name created by lead singer Jonathan Davis, is seen on the sandy ground by Dark Shadow; the way it's positioned next to the girls' shadow makes it appear the latter is being hanged.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{successful}} North American {{release of the}} original Final Fantasy by Nintendo in 1990, Square Soft, Square's North American subsidiary, began work on an English language localization of Final Fantasy II, to be called Final Fantasy II: <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadow</b> Over Palakia. Assigned to the project was Kaoru Moriyama, whose later work included script translations for Final Fantasy IV and Secret of Mana (known as Seiken Densetsu 2 in Japan). Although a beta version was produced, and the game was advertised in several Square Soft trade publications, the long development time, {{the age of the}} original Japanese game and the arrival of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System, the NES's successor console, led Square Soft to cancel work on the Final Fantasy II localization in favor of the recently released Final Fantasy IV (which, to avoid confusing North American players, was retitled Final Fantasy II to reflect the jump in releases).|$|E
50|$|There {{also have}} been several books about <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> {{including}} The <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Almanac and The <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Companion.|$|R
50|$|Lyndhurst was the set for {{the movies}} House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1970) and Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1971), both based on the gothic soap opera <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows.</b>|$|R
50|$|Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> were {{released}} on VHS on September 1, 1998, and on DVD and Blu-ray on October 30, 2012.

5|$|Scholar Andrew Spicer {{argues that}} British film noir evidences a greater debt to French poetic realism {{than to the}} expressionistic American mode of noir. Examples of British noir from the classic period include Brighton Rock (1947), {{directed}} by John Boulting; They Made Me a Fugitive (1947), directed by Alberto Cavalcanti; The Small Back Room (1948), directed by Michael Powell and Emeric Pressburger; The October Man (1950), directed by Roy Ward Baker; and Cast a <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadow</b> (1955), directed by Lewis Gilbert. Terence Fisher directed several low-budget thrillers in a noir mode for Hammer Film Productions, including The Last Page (a.k.a. Man Bait; 1952), Stolen Face (1952), and Murder by Proxy (a.k.a. Blackout; 1954). Before leaving for France, Jules Dassin had been obliged by political pressure to shoot his last English-language film of the classic noir period in Great Britain: Night and the City (1950). Though it was conceived in the United States and was not only directed by an American but also stars two American actors—Richard Widmark and Gene Tierney—it is technically a UK production, financed by 20th Century-Fox's British subsidiary. The most famous of classic British noirs is director Carol Reed's The Third Man (1949), from a screenplay by Graham Greene. Set in Vienna immediately after World War II, it also stars two American actors, Joseph Cotten and Orson Welles, who had appeared together in Citizen Kane.|$|E
25|$|In {{the twelfth}} stage, all the favourites {{finished}} together. That stage was won by Belgian Maurice Blomme, {{but not without}} difficulties: he was so exhausted that he mistook a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> for the finish line, and stopped racing. The secretary of the Tour de France, Jean Garnault, had to put him back on his bicycle so he would ride the last meters of the stage.|$|E
25|$|Success {{seemed to}} be on the horizon for Odom and Dogpatch USA, but the many {{unforeseen}} events of the 1970s cast a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> on Odom's dreams. Attendance figures throughout that decade were woefully short of expectations. In 1973, interest rates began to skyrocket, and a nationwide energy crisis kept many tourists home. In a bout of cancellations nicknamed the Rural purge, American television networks eliminated many shows with country themes, and the popularity of hillbillies waned. The Li'l Abner restaurant chain was never built. The proposed Li'l Abner TV series was never made; a pilot was produced and premiered as a television special on ABC-TV, but it received poor reviews and no network purchased the series.|$|E
50|$|While not {{appearing}} on <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> during those times, {{he appeared on}} Love Is a Many Splendored Thing as Jock Porter and Hidden Faces as Sharkey Primrose. He reunited with his <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> co-stars for the 1970 House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> as Willie Loomis, and, in 1971, with Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> as Alex Jenkins.|$|R
50|$|The 1970 Parallel Time storyline of the Gothic {{soap opera}} <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> was heavily {{inspired}} by Rebecca. Also the second <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> motion picture, Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> took {{inspiration from the}} novel.|$|R
50|$|The pilot never aired because The WB {{passed on}} the series. It was {{screened}} at a 2005 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> festival in Los Angeles, with subsequent showings at the 2006 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> 40th Anniversary Festival in Brooklyn, New York, the 2008 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Festival in Burbank, California and the 2009 <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> Festival in Elizabeth, New Jersey.|$|R
25|$|Manual {{tone mapping}} was {{accomplished}} by dodging and burning– selectively increasing or decreasing the exposure of regions of the photograph to yield better tonality reproduction. This was effective because the dynamic range of the negative is significantly higher than would be available on the finished positive paper print when that is exposed via the negative in a uniform manner. An excellent example is the photograph Schweitzer at the Lamp by W. Eugene Smith, from his 1954 photo essay A Man of Mercy on Dr. Albert Schweitzer and his humanitarian work in French Equatorial Africa. The image took 5 days to reproduce the tonal range of the scene, which ranges from a bright lamp (relative to the scene) to a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow.</b>|$|E
25|$|Secondary hemiepiphytes start life on {{the ground}} or on part of a tree trunk very close to the ground, where the seeds sprout. These philodendrons have their roots in the ground early in their lives. They then begin {{climbing}} up a tree and eventually may become completely epithytic, doing away with their subterranean roots. Secondary hemiepiphytes do not always start their lives close to a tree. For these philodendrons, the plant will grow with long internodes along the ground until a tree is found. They find a suitable tree by growing towards darker areas, such as the <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> of a tree. This trait is called scototropism. After a tree has been found, the scototropic behavior stops and the philodendron switches to a phototropic growth habit and the internodes shorten and thicken. Usually, however, philodendrons germinate on trees.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} Craig's monodramatic {{interpretation}} {{lay in the}} staging of the first court scene (1.2). The stage was divided sharply into two areas {{through the use of}} lighting: the background was brightly lit, while the foreground was dark and shadowy. The screens were lined up along the back wall and bathed in diffuse yellow light. From a high throne upon which Claudius and Gertrude sat, which was bathed in a diagonal, bright golden beam, a pyramid descended, representing the feudal hierarchy. The pyramid gave the illusion of a single, unified golden mass, from which the courtier's heads appeared to stick out through slits in the material. In the foreground in <b>dark</b> <b>shadow,</b> Hamlet lay slouched, as if dreaming. A gauze was hung between Hamlet and the court, further emphasising the division. On Claudius' exit-line the figures remained in place while the gauze was loosened, so that the entire court appeared to melt away before the audience's eyes, {{as if they had been}} a projection of Hamlet's thoughts that now had turned elsewhere. The scene, and the gauze effect in particular, prompted an ovation from the audience, which was unheard of at the MAT.|$|E

50|$|While on <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> she {{appeared}} in two films based on the series - House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1970) and Night of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> (1971). The series itself was canceled in April 1971. She appeared {{in a total of}} four hundred and five episodes.|$|R
5000|$|Several plot {{elements}} of this adaptation were also present in the storyline about Barnabas Collins in <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> specifically that Lucy was Dracula's lost love reborn. In <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows,</b> Barnabas Collins would find women looking like his love Josette. Dan Curtis was the producer of the original <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> series, and he carried the love story in his TV show into the 1970 film House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> and the TV remake 20 years later.|$|R
500|$|The midland {{painted turtle}} (C.p.marginata) is [...] long. The {{centrally}} located midland {{is the hardest}} to distinguish from the other three subspecies. Its bottom shell has a characteristic symmetrical <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> in the center which varies in size and prominence.|$|E
500|$|Beswick's {{apparently}} eccentric will {{made her}} a celebrity; the author Thomas de Quincey {{was one of those}} who went to view her at White's house. Following White's death in 1813, Beswick's body was bequeathed to a DrOllier, on whose death in 1828 it was donated to the Museum of the Manchester Natural History Society, where she became known as the Manchester Mummy, or the Mummy of Birchin Bower. She was displayed in the museum's entrance hall, next to a Peruvian and an Egyptian mummy, and her relatives were allowed free access to visit her as they wished. She was described by a visitor in 1844 as [...] "one of the most remarkable objects in the museum". The [...] "cold <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> of her mummy hung over Manchester in the middle of the eighteenth century", according to writer Edith Sitwell.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} written by series co-creators Larry David and Jerry Seinfeld and {{directed}} by Tom Cherones. David based the story on a personal experience of his, when he gave a ride home {{to a woman who}} had recently dated a friend of his. He would frequently come up with the idea for an episode and make it into a teleplay with Seinfeld's help; in a 1991 interview with the Los Angeles Times, Seinfeld stated: [...] "Most of the stories are from [...] life. He just has a tremendous wellspring of ideas. I mean, he just fills notebooks with ideas and I try to help him, but Larry is really the designer of the show." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club commented, [...] "Seinfeld started its second season, its first real season after a four-episode test run, very strongly with [...] "The Ex-Girlfriend", and {{it is the first time}} we really see George as the character we know and love, that weird <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> of Larry David's mind who behaves as no functioning human being honestly could." ...|$|E

50|$|All of the novels, {{with the}} {{exception}} of House of <b>Dark</b> <b>Shadows</b> were part of one shared continuity separate from the history supplied in the original television series.

500|$|In March 1953, {{three months}} before the Rosenbergs' executions, he wrote a letter for his {{attorney}} to deliver to President Eisenhower asking for their sentences to be commuted to prison terms so that they would have an opportunity to confess. He wrote: [...] "if these two die, I shall live {{the rest of my life}} with a very <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> on my conscience". He described his own testimony as [...] "an act of contrition for the wrong I had done my country, my family and myself" [...] and explained how he now viewed its consequences: [...] "Here I had to take the choice of hurting someone dear to me, and I took it deliberately. I could not believe that this would be the outcome. May God in His mercy change that awful sentence." [...] That same month he admitted he had stolen a few ounces of uranium-238 from a bomb laboratory at Los Alamos years before and had tossed it into the East River in 1950 after he first denied having stolen it.|$|E
2500|$|The {{financial}} misdeeds {{of various}} figures throughout American history sometimes casts a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> on financial investing as a whole, and include {{names such as}} William Duer, Jim Fisk and Jay Gould (the latter two {{believed to have been}} involved with an effort to collapse the U.S. gold market in 1869) as well as modern figures such as Bernard Madoff who [...] "bilked billions from investors".|$|E
2500|$|The {{story was}} praised by the award jury of the Japan Media Arts Festival for its brevity and its [...] "depiction of 'the <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> of war'". According to Izumi Evers, {{one of the}} editors of the English edition, the Japanese edition created a {{sensation}} despite being little-promoted because it made readers {{want to talk about the}} bombing of Hiroshima, which is a controversial topic. The manga sold over 180,000 copies in Japan.|$|E

2500|$|... is {{the most}} {{superior}} and powerful Blondie in Tanagura, {{and the head of}} the Syndicate, Tanagura's black market for pet trade. Iason has an elegant and calm demeanor that hides a passionate, ruthless, manipulative, and unforgiving nature. He is in love with his pet Riki, a mongrel from the slums, which casts a <b>dark</b> <b>shadow</b> over his seeming perfection. At first, Iason is interested in what it would be like to have a gang leader from the slums as a pet, instead of one of those non-thinking pets bred by the Academy, but slowly he begins to love Riki to the point of obsession. In the audio book, 1990s OVAs, and first drama CD, he is voiced by Kaneto Shiozawa. In the later drama CDs and remake OVAs, he is voiced by Tōru Ōkawa. In the English dub, he is voiced by Todd Haberkorn.|$|E
