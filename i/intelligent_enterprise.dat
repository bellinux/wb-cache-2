60|$|In Venice {{nothing in}} decay is strange. But it is startling {{to find her}} in her old age nourishing into fresh life an art that, after feebly {{preserving}} the memory of painting for so many centuries, had decorated her prime only with the glories of its decline;--for Kugler ascribes {{the completion of the}} mosaics of the church of St. Cyprian in Murano to the year 882, and the earliest mosaics of St. Mark's to the tenth or eleventh centuries, when the Greek Church had already laid her ascetic hand on Byzantine art, and fixed its conventional forms, paralyzed its motives, and forbidden its inspirations. I think, however, one would look about him in vain for other evidences of a returning prosperity in the lagoons. The old prosperity of Venice, was based upon her monopoly of the most lucrative traffic in the world, as we have already seen,--upon her exclusive privileges in foreign countries, upon the enlightened zeal of her government, and upon men's imperfect knowledge of geography, and the barbarism of the rest of Europe, as well as upon the indefatigable industry and <b>intelligent</b> <b>enterprise</b> of her citizens. America was still undiscovered; the overland route to India was the only one known; the people of the continent outside of Italy were unthrifty serfs, ruled and ruined by unthrifty lords. The whole world's ignorance, pride, and sloth were Venetian gain; and the religious superstitions of the day, which, gross as they were, embodied perhaps its noblest and most hopeful sentiment, were a source of incalculable profit to the sharp-witted mistress of the Adriatic. It was the age of penances, pilgrimages, and relic-hunting, and the wealth which she wrung from the devotion of others was exceedingly great. Her ships carried the pilgrims to and from the Holy Land; her adventurers ransacked Palestine and the whole Orient for the bones and memorials of the saints; and her merchants sold the precious relics throughout Europe at an immense advance upon first cost.|$|E

Manually created integration and test plans are often not optimal regarding time-to-market. Furthermore, creating and maintaining these plans costs a lot of effort. In this paper, we introduce a method that allows to automatically create optimal integration and test plans. This method can be used by <b>intelligent</b> <b>enterprises</b> to shorten the time-to-market of a system and to reduce the effort needed to create and maintain integration and test plans.

5000|$|The term [...] "Intelligent Enterprise" [...] {{refers to}} a {{management}} approach that applies technology and new service paradigms {{to the challenge of}} improving business performance. The concept, as articulated in James Brian Quinn's seminal book <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Enterprise</b> (Free Press, 1992) posits that intellect is the core resource in producing and delivering services. The book describes the management approach and computing infrastructure needed to harness that intellect effectively. This approach is referred to in business jargon as Knowledge Management, of which Quinn is an important proponent. Quinn is the William and Josephine Buchanan Professor of Management at the Amos Tuck School at Dartmouth College.|$|E
40|$|To {{compete in}} today&# 039;s environment, {{organizations}} {{have to develop}} an ability to use intelligently the knowledge assets already inherent within {{them as well as}} the new intellectual capita/they create daily. Many companies have already adopted some type of business intelligence (BI) tools such as report writers, spreadsheets, and, more recently, OLAP to gain a competitive advantage in decision making. However, these tools are woefully inadequate at analyzing data patterns. Thus, superior tools and methods are required. Knowledge discove 1 y is about understanding a business. It is a process that solves business problems by analyzing the data to identify patterns and relationships that can explain and predict behavior. It enables an organization to better understand its core business processes by searching automatically through voluminous data, looking for patterns of events, and presenting these to the business in an easy-to-understand graphical form.

This includes a rewarding work environment, low friction and energising within the company (Quinn, 1992).

However, {{the degree to which the}} <b>intelligent</b> <b>enterprise</b> can be successful depends on the “competencies of the people and its operational capabilities” (Yingzhao, Dexiong) [...] such as, structure, policies and systems.

50|$|A new {{generation}} of tools to support collaborative intelligence is poised to evolve from crowdsourcing platforms, recommender systems, and evolutionary computation. Existing tools to facilitate group problem-solving include collaborative groupware, such as GitHub, Google+, Confluence, eXo Platform, JIRA, Skype, NetMeeting, WebEx, and synchronous conferencing technologies such as instant messaging, online chat and shared white boards, which are complemented by asynchronous messaging like electronic mail, threaded, moderated discussion forums, web logs, and group Wikis. Managing the <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Enterprise</b> relies on these tools, as well as methods for group member interaction; promotion of creative thinking; group membership feedback; quality control and peer review; and a documented group memory or knowledge base. As groups work together, they develop a shared memory, which is accessible through the collaborative artifacts created by the group, including meeting minutes, transcripts from threaded discussions, and drawings. The shared memory (group memory) is also accessible through the memories of group members; current interest focuses on how technology can support and augment the effectiveness of shared past memory and capacity for future problem-solving.

40|$|Abstract. Jackal is a Java-based {{tool for}} {{communication}} using the KQML agent communication language. Some features {{that make it}} ex-tremely valuable to agent development are its conversation manage-ment facilities, exible, blackboard style interface and ease of integra-tion. Jackal has been developed in support of {{an investigation of the}} use of agents in enterprise-wide integration of planning and execution for manufacturing. Additionally, Jackal {{has been used as a}} framework for exploring alternative conversation-based approaches to managing agent interaction. In particular, we have been investigating the use of Colored Petri Nets as the underlying formal model for a conversation specica-tion language. This model carries the relative simplicity and graphical representation of the more familiar Finite State Machine, along with greater expressive power and support for concurrency. This paper de-scribes Jackal at a surface and design level, and demonstrates its use in a multi-agent system that supports <b>intelligent</b> integration of <b>enterprise</b> planning and execution. It further describes the use of Colored Petri Nets for the specication of interation protocols within a system such as Jackal. ...|$|R
