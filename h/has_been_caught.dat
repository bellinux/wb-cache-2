5|$|In the episode, newly wedded companions Amy Pond (Karen Gillan) and Rory Williams (Arthur Darvill) {{are trapped}} on a {{crashing}} space liner which <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> {{in a strange}} cloud belt. They call the Doctor (Matt Smith), who lands on the planet below and meets the miserly Kazran Sardick (Michael Gambon), {{a man who can}} control the cloud layer but refuses to help. Inspired by Charles Dickens's A Christmas Carol, the episode has the Doctor attempting to use time travel to alter Kazran's past and make him kinder so he will save the spaceship.|$|E
5|$|One of the widest-ranging {{deepwater}} sharks, the Portuguese dogfish is patchily distributed {{around the}} world. In the western Atlantic, it occurs from the Grand Banks of Newfoundland to the U.S. state of Delaware. In the eastern Atlantic, {{it is found}} from Iceland to Sierra Leone, including the western Mediterranean Sea, the Azores and Madeira, {{as well as from}} southern Namibia to western South Africa. In the Indian Ocean, this species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> off the Seychelles. In the Pacific, this shark occurs off Japan, New Zealand, and Australia from Cape Hawke, New South Wales, to Beachport, South Australia, including Tasmania.|$|E
5|$|The President of Croatia enjoys immunity—the {{president}} {{may not be}} arrested, nor can any criminal proceedings be instituted against the president without prior consent from the Constitutional Court. The only case in which immunity does not apply is if the president <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> {{in the act of}} committing a criminal offense, which carries a penalty of imprisonment for more than five years. In such a case the state body that has detained the president must notify the President of the Constitutional Court immediately.|$|E

5|$|Though rarely encountered, {{the false}} {{catshark}} <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> from locations {{scattered around the}} world, indicating a wide circumglobal distribution. In the western Atlantic, {{it has been reported}} from Canada, the United States, Cuba, and Brazil. In the eastern Atlantic, it is known from the waters of Iceland, France, Portugal, and Senegal, as well as the islands of Madeira, the Azores, the Canaries, and Cape Verde. Records from the Indian Ocean have come from off Madagascar, the Aldabra Group, Mauritius, Indonesia, and Australia. In the Pacific Ocean, it has been documented from Japan, Taiwan, Indonesia, the Coral Sea, New Zealand, and the Hawaiian Islands.|$|E
5|$|Rather uncommon, the {{frilled shark}} has been {{recorded}} {{from a number of}} widely scattered locations in the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs off northern Norway, northern Scotland, and western Ireland, from France to Morocco including Madeira, and off Mauritania. In the central Atlantic, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> at several locations along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, from north of the Azores to the Rio Grande Rise off southern Brazil, as well as over the Vavilov Ridge off West Africa. In the western Atlantic, it has been reported from waters off New England, Georgia, and Suriname. In the western Pacific, it is known from southeastern Honshu, Japan, to Taiwan, off New South Wales and Tasmania in Australia, and around New Zealand. In the central and eastern Pacific, it has been found off Hawaii, California, and northern Chile. The frilled sharks off southern Africa were described as a different species, C. africana, in 2009.|$|E
5|$|Subspecies (1991) follows three college students, Mara, Michelle, and Lillian, as {{they begin}} a study on Romanian culture and superstition {{in the small town}} Prejmer. They are befriended by Stefan, a student {{studying}} nocturnal animals. It is revealed that the nearby Castle Vladislas <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> in a power struggle between vampire brothers Stefan and Radu. Centuries prior, King Vladislas was seduced and cursed by a sorceress who eventually gave birth to Radu. After banishing Radu's mother, the king met a mortal woman. She gave birth to Stefan, who prefers to live in the open, and loathes his vampire heritage. To gain control over the Bloodstone, a relic that is said to drip the blood of the saints, Radu kills his father. In an effort to hurt his brother, Radu turns Mara and Lillian into vampires. Stefan, having fallen in love with Michelle, helps her try and free Mara and Lillian from Radu's control. Stefan drives a stake through Radu's heart and severs his head with a sword, killing Radu. Unfortunately for Stefan, Radu bites Michelle before his brother can kill him and mingled his blood with hers, which forces Stefan to turn Michelle with his own blood in order to keep her from becoming like Radu. As Stefan and Michelle sleep, Radu's minions set about resurrecting their master.|$|E

25|$|The game is {{won only}} after the snitch <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> cleanly, and the team that caught the snitch is awarded 30 points. The winner is {{determined}} not by the snitch catch but {{by the number of}} points earned; thus it is not unknown for teams that are losing by a wide margin to try delaying a snitch catch so that they can narrow the opponents' lead, along with the reverse, with the winning team trying to extend their lead.|$|E
25|$|Releasing wild trout helps {{preserve}} {{the quality of}} a fishery. Trout are more delicate than most fish and require careful handling. When a trout <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> but the hook is still embedded, wet your hands before handling the fish. Dry hands stick to the adhesive slime coating the fish and can pull off its scales. It is preferred for the fish to remain in the water when removing the hook, but holding the trout out of the water will not be lethal, provided the hook is removed quickly and the trout is returned immediately.|$|E

25|$|Because {{of their}} {{prolific}} and predatory nature, {{laws have been}} enacted in some places to help {{stop the spread of}} northern pike outside of their native range. For instance, in California, anglers are required by law to remove the head from a pike once it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught.</b> In Alaska, pike are native north and west of the Alaska Range, but have been illegally introduced to south-central Alaska by game fishermen. In south-central Alaska, no limit is imposed in most areas. Pike are seen as a threat to native wild stocks of salmon by some fishery managers.|$|E
25|$|The game ends {{after the}} snitch <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> through {{what is called}} by a clean catch. The catch is {{determined}} by the Snitch Referee, The Head Referee, and the Snitch Runner. The team that caught the snitch is awarded 30 points, regardless if they are winning or losing the game. The winner is determined not by the snitch catch but by the number of points earned throughout the entirety of the game play. Depending on the score teams will delay the snitch catch in order to better their chances of winning. Teams that are losing will defend the snitch by placing themselves between the Snitch Runner and the opposing seeker.|$|E
25|$|Neal, {{desperate to}} stay out of prison and find Kate, knows that he must find a legal way to have Hagen taken down. He takes off toward the warehouse, exiting the two-mile radius his {{tracking}} anklet allows him to stay within. Peter is alerted at the FBI headquarters that Neal has bolted. Peter believes that Neal has run off in search of Kate; however, he tracks him to Hagen's warehouse. With Neal, a convicted felon, inside the warehouse, Peter now has probable cause to enter. He does, and discovers Hagen running a massive counterfeiting operation. Hagen and his men are taken into custody, and Peter remarks to Neal that this is the third time Neal <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught.</b>|$|E

25|$|The {{threadfin}} jack is of some {{importance to}} fisheries throughout its range, although individual catch {{statistics for the}} species are not kept. It is often caught by hook-and-line methods or by gill nets and various artisanal traps. It {{is considered to be}} good to excellent table fare, and is marketed both fresh and salted. The species has also been found at a number of archaeological sites in both Panama and Ecuador, indicating it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> by humans for food for at least 3450 years. The threadfin jack is also of interest to anglers who catch the species occasionally, and is considered a minor gamefish. Juveniles are occasionally caught from shore, such as piers and breakwaters, while larger individuals are caught over deeper reefs. The species takes a variety of bait, including fish and prawns, but they also take lures, including hard and small, fly-like Sabiki lures.|$|E
25|$|Spiders are {{notified}} {{that potential}} prey <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> {{in the web}} through vibrations along strands, these can be followed to the prey location on the web and be used to estimate prey size. Due to the large variety in prey Nephila has different attack techniques dependent on prey size. Small prey like flies are captured alive then removed from the web and wrapped in silk. This occurs with smaller prey {{because they do not}} present a threat to the spider when alive. Prey that is seen as potentially threatening will be bitten to be subdued before wrapping. Medium-sized prey will receive bites that are sustained until prey is immobilised and then be covered in silk. Finally, the largest captured prey receive the –bite and back off– treatment where a single lunging bite is made before the spider withdraws and waits for the venom to take effect before wrapping. This lunging bite is often repeated to speed up the process of immobilisation.|$|E
25|$|Sheep are {{sometimes}} eaten in considerable numbers, {{especially in the}} Inner and Outer Hebrides of Scotland (25.9% and 26.8% of nest remains respectively). Differentiating whether a lamb <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> and killed while alive or scavenged as a carcass is possible if the remains are in good condition. In one examination of 10 such remains in nests in Scotland, {{it was found that}} 3 lambs had been taken alive and 7 after they had died. This suggests the majority of lambs are taken as carrion, which is reinforced by the fact that much ungulate carrion found around active nest sites in Scotland is already in a malodorous and putrid state. Domestic goats (Capra aegagrus hircus) are occasionally predated as well. Goats slightly outnumbered sheep in the diet of eagles breeding on Corsica, with both domesticated animals making up 20.5% of the diet there and being the most important food source. In North America, lambs and goats were found to comprise less than 1.4% of all prey items. In Montana, it was found that most predation on lambs by golden eagles was committed by juvenile eagles or eagles that failed to breed (which have no need to carry prey to a nest). There {{it was found that the}} hunting of domestic stock peaks during wet, cold springs that seemed to adversely effect the local abundance of jackrabbits. Pigs (including feral and domestic varieties) are occasionally taken, especially in insular populations. Studies showed pigs (most certainly taken as carrion) made up to 13.3% of the diet in Corsica and 43.1% on Santa Cruz Island, California. Few wild pigs co-exist with golden eagles but wild boar (Sus scrofa) (likely only as piglets or carrion) have been taken in Bulgaria.|$|E

25|$|In Should Old Acquaintance Be Forgot?, Naomi {{is still}} rocking her party-planning {{internship}} under Rachel’s guidance. Her relationship with Austin has ended after Austin allegedly cheated on her with Holly. Austin says Holly snuck in and attacked him {{right after he}} came out of the shower but Naomi refuses to listen to him. Naomi has been so hard at work that her boss, Holly’s mother, gives Naomi the responsibility of hosting her very own event, which is the debutant ball. During the ball, Naomi has rebound sex with a stranger in order to get over Austin. After Naomi <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>caught</b> in front of the entire party, Rachel fires her. However, Naomi tells her that Rachel's daughter cheated with her boyfriend. Rachel has sympathy and lets it slide but advises Naomi that she has to be a strong woman and deal with her problems. In Mama Can You Hear Me?, Naomi decides to become a ‘New Naomi’ and try to patch things between Holly and her mother. Rachel briefs Naomi about the impending award season. She entrusts Naomi with a very important assignment. Naomi suggests to her boss that maybe Holly can help too. Although Rachel is reluctant, she agrees to go with Naomi’s suggestion, and appoints Holly as Naomi’s new assistant; shocking both Naomi and Holly. Naomi tries to make amends with Holly, by entrusting her with the very important assignment of getting Mitchell Nash from the hotel to the event. At the event, Rachel is really happy with the way Naomi has organized things, while she is waiting intently for Holly to arrive with Mitchell Nash. Holly arrives at the scene and tells them that Mitchell Nash wasn’t staying at the hotel she had gone to. The boss blasts Naomi for entrusting such an important responsibility to Holly, who according to her has always been irresponsible. Holly and Naomi, haul in a completely drunk Nash to the event. He pukes on the red carpet, with the reporters having a field day. Later Holly and her mother are at it, with Holly trying to defend her position in all that transpired. Naomi again tries defending Holly in front of her mother. The whole thing proves counterproductive, with Naomi getting fired. Later, Holly thanks Naomi for all that she did for her and they both decide to become friends.|$|E
