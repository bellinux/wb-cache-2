Although many natural <b>intercalators</b> contain multiple chiral subunits, only <b>intercalators</b> {{with a single}} chiral unit have been quantitatively probed. Dumbbell-shaped DNA threading <b>intercalators</b> represent the next order of structural complexity relative to simple <b>intercalators,</b> and can provide significant insights into the stereoselectivity of DNA-ligand intercalation. We investigated DNA threading intercalation by binuclear ruthenium complex [mu-dppzip(phen) (4) Ru- 2](4 +) (Piz). Four Piz stereoisomers are defined by the chirality of the intercalating subunit (Ru(phen) (2) dppz) and the distal subunit (Ru(phen) (2) ip), respectively, each {{of which can be}} either right-handed (Delta) or left-handed (Lambda). We used optical tweezers to measure single DNA molecule elongation due to threading intercalation, revealing force-dependent DNA intercalation rates and equilibrium dissociation constants. The force spectroscopy analysis provided the zero-force DNA binding affinity, the equilibrium DNA-ligand elongation Delta x(eq), and the dynamic DNA structural deformations during ligand association x(on) and dissociation x(off). We found that Piz stereoisomers exhibit over 20 -fold differences in DNA binding affinity, from a K-d of 27 +/- 3 nM for (Delta,Lambda) -Piz to a K-d of 622 +/- 55 nM for (Lambda,Delta) -Piz. The striking affinity decrease is correlated with increasing Delta x(eq) from 0. 30 +/- 0. 02 to 0. 48 +/- 0. 02 nm and x(on) from 0. 25 +/- 0. 01 to 0. 46 +/- 0. 02 nm, but limited x(off) changes.

The aim {{of the study was}} to explore how stable the ordered domains were and how different, biologically interesting, membrane <b>intercalators</b> could affect domain stability and sterol distribution between domains. We show that sterols easily can be displaced from ordered domains by a variety of saturated, single- and double-chain membrane <b>intercalators</b> with a small polar group as a common denominator. Of the two-chain <b>intercalators</b> examined, both palmitoyl ceramide and palmitoyl dihydroceramide were effective in displacing sterols from ordered domains.

Bulky rhodium <b>intercalators</b> target DNA base mismatches with high specificity.

Preferential inhibition by the rhodium complexes associated with MMR deficiency is seen both in a human colon cancer cell line and in normal mouse fibroblast cells; the inhibition of cellular proliferation depends strictly on the MMR deficiency of the cell. Furthermore, our assay of cellular proliferation is found to correlate with DNA mismatch targeting by the bulky metallointercalators. It is the {Delta}-isomer that is active both in targeting base mismatches and in inhibiting DNA synthesis.

5000|$|In {{order for}} an <b>intercalator</b> to fit between base pairs, the DNA must {{dynamically}} open a space between its base pairs by unwinding. The degree of unwinding {{varies depending on}} the intercalator; for example, ethidium cation (the ionic form of ethidium bromide found in aqueous solution) unwinds DNA by about 26°, whereas proflavine unwinds it by about 17°. This unwinding causes the base pairs to separate, or [...] "rise", creating an opening of about 0.34 nm (3.4 Å). This unwinding induces local structural changes to the DNA strand, such as lengthening of the DNA strand or twisting of the base pairs. These structural modifications can lead to functional changes, often to the inhibition of transcription and replication and DNA repair processes, which makes intercalators potent mutagens. For this reason, DNA intercalators are often carcinogenic, such as the exo (but not the endo) 8,9 epoxide of aflatoxin B1, acridines such as proflavine or quinacrine, or ethidium bromide.|$|E
