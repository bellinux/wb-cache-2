5|$|They {{developed}} into a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> due to the harsh climate, limited shelter, and sparse food sources of their native country.

5|$|Limousin cattle {{evolved in}} the French region now known as Limousin. The region {{comprises}} the historical French provinces of Limousin and Marche, which include the departments of Corrèze in its entirety, most of Creuse, and parts of Haute-Vienne. Limousin cattle adapted to the local hilly conditions of acidic soils and weakly mineralised granite, with large variations in temperature. These factors {{led to the development}} of a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> with an unusually thin but solid bone.|$|E
5|$|Outside {{of these}} {{breeding}} efforts, Finnish horses were widely kept in semi-feral conditions through the mid-19th century. Ethnologist Kustaa Vilkuna describes how all horses regardless or sex and age were let out on forest pastures {{for the summer}} after the spring fieldwork was finished. The pasture was scarce and the terrain challenging, with both rocky ground and wetlands. Vilkuna considers this practice {{an important factor in}} making the Finnhorse an easy-keeping, <b>hardy</b> <b>breed.</b>|$|E
50|$|Wages {{are higher}} than {{was the case in}} the past. Keeping a {{shepherd}} in constant attendance can be costly. Also, the eradication of sheep predators in parts of the world have lessened the need for shepherds. In places like Britain, <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds</b> of sheep are frequently left alone without a shepherd for long periods of time. More productive breeds of sheep can be left in fields and moved periodically to fresh pasture when necessary. <b>Hardier</b> <b>breeds</b> of sheep can be left on hillsides. The sheep farmer will attend to the sheep when necessary at times like lambing or shearing.|$|R
40|$|To {{identify}} the benefic effects of breeding practices, for the fattening period, on the Longissimus Thoracis sensory properties, a dataset obtained from 329 young bulls (2 breed types: beef and hardy) was analyzed. Animals were classified in 2 clusters: {{high and low}} sensory quality of beef meat. Different breeding practices combinations driven to high sensory quality were highlighted with decision trees, according to breed types. A higher beef quality is possible with a forage intake ≥ 1. 95 kg DM/d in the fattening diet and a fattening period duration < 178 d for young beef breed bulls. The slaughter age of young bulls had {{a positive impact on}} beef quality of <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds</b> (≥ 17. 2 mo) and beef breeds (between 15. 4 and 16. 8 mo) if it was combined with a longer fattening period duration and a higher average daily gain, for beef breeds and in addition with a heavier weight for <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds...</b>|$|R

5|$|They are a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> due {{to their}} native environment, the Highlands of Scotland. This results in long hair, giving the breed its ability to overwinter. Bulls can weigh up to 800kilograms (1,800 pounds) and cows up to 500kilograms (1,100 pounds). Their milk {{generally}} has a very high butterfat content, and their meat, regarded as of the highest quality, is gaining mainstream acceptance as it is lower in cholesterol than other varieties of beef.|$|E
5|$|This is a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> {{with few}} breed {{specific}} health problems. The main hereditary problem {{highlighted by the}} American Sealyham Terrier Club is an eye condition called lens luxation, for which there are DNA tests. Lens luxation is {{a condition in which}} the lens slips out of position in the eyeball due to the weakening of the fibers that holds it in place.|$|E
5|$|It is a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed,</b> {{and can be}} stubborn, {{leading to}} issues with {{training}}. A Westie may need to have its training refreshed on occasion during its lifetime. Having a typical terrier prey drive, {{it tends to be}} highly interested in toys, especially chasing balls. It does retain the instincts of an earth-dog, including inquisitive and investigative traits, as well as natural instincts to both bark and dig holes. It is ranked 47th in Stanley Coren's The Intelligence of Dogs.|$|E
5000|$|While the Shetland could {{thrive on}} inhospitable lands, the {{evolution}} of agricultural practices and chemicals made grass more plentiful for less <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds,</b> and these larger bulls could sire calves that would grow larger and more quickly. Increasing {{the size of the}} cattle was attractive in the aftermath of John Boyd-Orr's influential studies in the 1930s, which revealed a deficiency in the [...] "midst of plenty" [...] among the United Kingdom's urban proletariat, whose diet lacked meat.|$|R
50|$|In 1857-1858 Alexander Buchanan, {{overseer}} for F. H. Dutton's Anlaby Estate in the Mid-North of South Australia, {{released a}} number of rabbits for hunting sport. Their population remained fairly stable until around 1866, presumed to have been kept in check by native carnivores and were protected by an Act of Parliament, but by 1867 was out of control. The population explosion was ascribed to the disappearance of native predators, but is easily explained {{by the emergence of}} a <b>hardier</b> <b>breed</b> by natural selection.|$|R
50|$|It is a {{national}} nature reserve established by English Nature and {{in the care of}} the Norfolk Wildlife Trust, who run boat trips around the reserve for visitors. It is also part of the Upper Thurne Broads and Marshes Site of Special Scientific Interest. In the 1990s, over £650,000 was spent on restoring the reserve, and invasive plants are kept under control by grazing <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds</b> of cattle, sheep and ponies from Eastern Europe. Water levels are managed, and the reed and sedge beds are regularly mown to encourage wildlife.|$|R
5|$|The Welsh Mountain sheep is a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> {{that can}} scrape {{a living from}} the mountainous {{habitats}} where they spend the whole year. Being adept at exploiting their environment, they have local knowledge of their mountains and are {{left to their own}} devices, being gathered once or twice a year. Originally often horned, and various shades of brown or black, they were often of poor conformation and bedraggled appearance. More recently, scientific breeding has improved them and they have been exported to many parts of the world. They form part of the ancestry of various local breeds of sheep in Wales, the Llanwenog, the Lleyn sheep, the Kerry Hill, the badger-faced, the Welsh mule and the Beulah speckle-faced. In rural areas, sheep are still an important part of life with local livestock shows and sheep dog trials taking place annually.|$|E
5|$|New Forest ponies have {{a gentle}} {{temperament}} and {{a reputation for}} intelligence, strength, and versatility. On the whole, they are a sturdy and <b>hardy</b> <b>breed.</b> The one known hereditary genetic disorder found in the breed is congenital myotonia, a muscular condition also found in humans, dogs, cats, and goats. It was identified in the Netherlands in 2009, after a clinically affected foal {{was presented to the}} Equine Clinic of Utrecht University. DNA sequencing revealed that the affected foal was homozygous for a missense mutation in the gene encoding CLCN1, a protein which regulates the excitability of the skeletal muscle. The mutated allele was found in both the foal's parents, its siblings, and two other related animals, none of whom exhibited any clinical signs. The researchers concluded that the condition has an autosomal recessive mode of inheritance, whereby both parents have to contribute the mutated allele for a physically affected foal to be produced with that phenotype. The study suggested that the mutation was of relatively recent origin: the founder of the mutated gene, as all the ponies who tested positive for the mutation are direct descendants of this stallion. The probable founder stallion has been identified as Kantje's Ronaldo; testing is now underway to identify which of his offspring carry the mutated gene. All carriers will be removed from the breeding section of the New Forest Pony Breeding & Cattle Society's stud book, and all New Forest stallions licensed in the UK also will be tested, whether or not they descend from Kantje's Ronaldo, to cover the possibility that the mutated gene may have appeared earlier in the pedigree, although it is believed that the mutated gene has now been eradicated from the British breeding stock. All breeding stock imported to the UK also will be tested.|$|E

25|$|The American Eskimo is a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> with {{an average}} life span of 12–15 years. This breed tends to become {{overweight}} easily, so proper diet and exercise is needed to maintain an overall well being. Health testing should be performed by all responsible breeders and anyone purchasing a puppy {{should be aware of}} the genetic problems which have been found in some individuals of the breed, such as PRA (Progressive Retinal Atrophy), luxating patella, and hip dysplasia). None of these problems are common and the breed is generally very healthy. In addition to the rarer problems mentioned, the breed can have a tendency towards allergies and most commonly, tear-staining. This breed also is known in some cases to have dental issues.|$|E
6000|$|Yes; and the {{chickens}} have something of this same spunk {{of life in}} them. Featherless, semi-frozen despite the oil-stove, sprayed dripping on occasion by the frigid seas that pound by sheer weight through canvas tarpaulins, nevertheless not a chicken has died. Is it a matter of selection? Are these the iron-vigoured ones that survived the hardships from Baltimore to the Horn, and are fitted to survive anything? Then for a De Vries to take them, save them, and out of them found the <b>hardiest</b> <b>breed</b> of chickens on the planet! And after this I shall always query that phrase, most ancient in our language--"chicken-hearted." [...] Measured by the Elsinore's chickens, it is a misnomer.|$|R
50|$|Shetland cattle, {{from the}} Shetland Isles, off {{the north coast}} of Scotland, are a small, <b>hardy</b> cattle <b>breed,</b> which, until recent times, were {{traditionally}} milked three times a day—morning, twall (midday) and night—to produce {{the maximum amount of}} milk, which could be more than three gallons.|$|R
50|$|The Lokai, a {{mountain}} horse bred in Tajikistan, {{is used as}} a riding horse, a packhorse, or even sometimes a light draft horse.

25|$|In 1806, much of Calabria {{was a rough}} place. The 1783 Calabrian {{earthquakes}} {{had killed}} 100,000 persons. Much of Reggio was still in ruins as late as 1813 and many churches were not been rebuilt by 1806. The Calabrians were a <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> with an independent streak. They sometimes indulged in vendettas against neighboring families and villages. Plundering Imperial troops and grasping French civil authorities quickly set off a rebellion by the proud Calabrians. On the other hand, {{the residents of the}} major towns despised the Neapolitan royal government and often favored the French. The revolt flared up after certain incidents. At Scigliano the French left a detachment of 50 soldiers. A woman was raped and the villagers massacred most of the Frenchmen. The French commanders had only one response to such events, to assault, sack, and burn down the offending village. This led directly to an ugly cycle of atrocity and counter-atrocity. The newly anointed King Joseph tried to be fair. He ordered French soldiers to be shot for criminal offenses and French officials to be put on trial for corruption. Nevertheless, the Calabrian insurrection soon ran out of control. The Siege of Gaeta would occupy the French from 26 February to 18 July. Meanwhile, the Battle of Maida on 4 July would seriously threaten French control of Calabria.|$|E

500|$|Poitevin mares were {{crossbred}} with Poitou donkeys {{to create}} the famous Poitou mule, a large, <b>hardy</b> <b>breed.</b> As mules are hybrids, and thus sterile, they can only be created through crossing a donkey and a horse. The industry of mule breeding in Poitou has existed {{since at least the}} 18th century, when it was opposed by the government stud farm administration that was attempting to breed cavalry horses for French troops. At the beginning of the 19th century, the government prohibited breeding mules from mares taller than , and threatened to castrate all donkeys in the region. In the 1860s, equine historian Eugene Gayot described a horse that he called the [...] "poitevine mulassière", and stated that the main purpose of this breed was to produce mares from which to breed mules. He added that this breed was also called the Poitevin. Mares of many breeds were used to produce mules at that point in history, but Gayot noted that the heavy mares from the Poitou marshes produced the best mules, likely because the Poitevin mares bequeathed to their descendents the same heavy bone structure.|$|E
500|$|Upland and hill farms provide grazing for <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds</b> {{of cattle}} like Welsh Blacks and for Welsh Mountain sheep. The cattle are {{normally}} housed {{in winter and}} may graze the open hillside in summer. The trampling of their hooves helps control bracken and they feed {{on a wide range}} of vegetation and on coarse tufts of grass that sheep cannot tackle. The sheep are mostly [...] "hefted" [...] on the unfenced open hillside all year round. Here they know their way around, know where to graze at different times of year and where to shelter. The male lambs are used for meat and most of the females are retained on the hill as flock replacements. Aged ewes are moved to lower elevations and crossed with lowland rams to produce Welsh mule ewes, which are then used for breeding.|$|R

500|$|Pet {{insurance}} {{data obtained}} from a study during years 2003–2006 in Sweden puts the median lifespan of the Maine Coon at >12.5 years. 74% lived to 10 years or more and 54% lived to 12.5 years or more. Maine Coons are generally a healthy and <b>hardy</b> <b>breed</b> and have adapted to survive the New England climate. The most severe threat is feline hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM), the most common heart disease seen in cats, whether pure bred or not. In Maine Coons, it {{is thought to be}} inherited as an autosomal dominant trait. Middle-aged to older cats as well as males are thought to be predisposed to the disease. HCM is a progressive disease and can result in heart failure, paralysis of the hind legs due to clot embolization originating in the heart, and sudden death. A specific mutation that causes HCM is seen in Maine Coons for which testing services are offered. Of all the Maine Coons tested for the MyBPC mutation at the Veterinary Cardiac Genetics Lab at the College of Veterinary Medicine located at Washington State University, approximately one-third tested positive. [...] Not all cats that tested positive will have clinical signs of the disease and some Maine Coon cats with clinical evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy test negative for this mutation, strongly suggesting that a second mutation exists in the breed. The HCM prevalence was found to be 10.1% (95% CI 5.8 -14.3% [...] ) in this study.|$|E

50|$|Kali tragus is a ruderal annual forb. It germinates rapidly even in {{very small}} amounts of {{moisture}} in arid conditions. When young it may be grazed freely, but that phase lasts for only a brief period, and generally {{at a time when}} other forage is relatively plentiful. After this it becomes a weed in most contexts. One reason is that as they mature most varieties become too spiny and woody for most stock to browse. As its fruits mature, the plant dies, dries and becomes hard and brittle. It is in this state that it is likely to detach from its root and become a tumbleweed. As tumbleweeds go, it is very large, often a metre or more in diameter, spiny, largely inedible to most livestock if unprocessed, and a fire hazard. However, in regions where there is plentiful winter rain, the moisture softens both the twigs and the spines, after which <b>hardy</b> <b>breeds</b> of livestock and some wildlife species once again will eat it.|$|R
