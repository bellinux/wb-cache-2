40|$|A {{system for}} {{cleaning}} and verifying the cleanliness {{of the interior}} surfaces of hollow items, such as small bottles, tanks, pipes and tubes, employs a rotating <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> for supplying a gas-liquid cleaning mixture to the item's surface at a supersonic velocity. The <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> incorporates a plurality of nozzles having diverging cross sections so that the incoming gas-liquid mixture is first converged within the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and then diverged through the nozzles, thereby accelerating the mixture to a supersonic velocity. In the preferred embodiment, three nozzles are employed; one forwardly facing nozzle {{at the end of}} the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and two oppositely facing angled nozzles exiting on opposite sides of the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> which balance each other, and therefore impart no net side load on the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> A drive mechanism is provided to rotate the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> and at the same time move the head back and forth within the item to be cleaned. The drive mechanism acts on a long metal tube to which the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> is fixed, and thus no moving parts are exposed to the interior surfaces of the items to be cleaned, thereby reducing the risk of contamination...|$|R

50|$|There are {{two main}} types of {{sprinklers}} used in lawn irrigation, pop-up <b>spray</b> <b>heads</b> and rotors. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> have a fixed spray pattern, while rotors have one or more streams that rotate. <b>Spray</b> <b>heads</b> are used to cover smaller areas, while rotors are used for larger areas. Golf course rotors are sometimes so large that a single sprinkler is combined with a valve and called a 'valve in head'. When used in a turf area, the sprinklers are installed with {{the top of the}} head flush with the ground surface. When the system is pressurized, the head will pop up out of the ground and water the desired area until the valve closes and shuts off that zone. Once there is no more pressure in the lateral line, the sprinkler head will retract back into the ground. In flower beds or shrub areas, sprinklers may be mounted on above ground risers or even taller pop-up sprinklers may be used and installed flush as in a lawn area.|$|R

40|$|Low-pressure centre-pivot {{systems are}} usually {{equipped}} with <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> sprinklers {{that can have}} different types of deflector plates and thus produce different drop sizes causing different effects on the infiltration process. Field tests using low-pressure (140 kPa) <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> sprinklers with smooth and medium groove deflector plates and maximum water applications rates between 99 and 125 mm/h were carried out in a Mediterranean soil. These tests {{made it possible to}} study the effect of the deflector plate on irrigation uniformity, runoff and sediment yield. Medium groove deflectors produce lower irrigation uniformity, but apply water with larger water droplets which are less affected by wind and can lead to less evaporation and wind drift losses. However, these droplets have higher impact energy over the soil surface, increasing surface sealing and crust formation, which reduce infiltration and increase runoff. Higher runoff amounts and soil particles detachment produced by grooved deflectors also lead to more sediment yield and soil erosion...|$|R

During the growing season, 0. 2 % and 0. 4 % solution of Kelpak SL was applied by single and <b>double</b> <b>spraying</b> of plants. These four treatments with Kelpak SL were compared with the control, where no biostimulator was applied. Kelpak SL treatments stimulated the yield of both cultivars studied. The application of E. maxima extract had no effect on the content of starch, free sugars or proteins in seeds of either of the tested cultivars. The highest level of phenolics was found for <b>double</b> <b>sprayed</b> Toska plants. All the tested variants of Kelpak SL application significantly increased the content of anthocyanins in the seeds. Also, both the reducing power and antiradical ability of Aura seeds were elevated in all the studied treatments.

50|$|An {{electric}} drip {{coffee maker}} {{can also be}} referred to as a dripolator. It normally works by admitting water from a cold water reservoir into a flexible hose in the base of the reservoir leading directly to a thin metal tube or heating chamber (usually, of aluminum), where a heating element surrounding the metal tube heats the water. The heated water moves through the machine using the thermosiphon principle. Thermally-induced pressure and the siphoning effect move the heated water through an insulated rubber or vinyl riser hose, into a <b>spray</b> <b>head,</b> and onto the ground coffee, which is contained in a brew basket mounted below the <b>spray</b> <b>head.</b> The coffee passes through a filter and drips down into the carafe. A one-way valve in the tubing prevents water from siphoning back into the reservoir. A thermostat attached to the heating element turns off the heating element as needed to prevent overheating the water in the metal tube (overheating would produce only steam in the supply hose), then turns back on when the water cools below a certain threshold. For a standard 10-12 cup drip coffeemaker, using a more powerful thermostatically-controlled heating element (in terms of wattage produced), can heat increased amounts of water more quickly using larger heating chambers, generally producing higher average water temperatures at the <b>spray</b> <b>head</b> over the entire brewing cycle. This process can be further improved by changing the aluminum construction of most heating chambers to a metal with superior heat transfer qualities, such as copper.|$|R
