5|$|Sakura {{has become}} the series' female lead, although, she was not {{immediately}} intended for the role. Kishimoto has had difficulty <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> character resulting in Kishimoto inadvertently emphasizing certain parts of her appearance, including her large forehead. In {{order to make the}} character more appealing {{in the second part of}} the series, Kishimoto designed her costume to make her look more like a martial artist as well as more beautiful during later chapters. Chie Nakamura voices the character in the animated adaptations of the series, while Kate Higgins plays her in the English dub.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} {{laid down by}} Swan Hunter & Wigham Richardson at Wallsend-on-Tyne, England, on 8 July 1933 for the Royal Navy as HMS Phaeton, named after the Greek mythological figure. However, in 1934, the Australian {{government}} was seeking a replacement for the light cruiser , and negotiated to purchase Phaeton {{while she was still}} under construction. The cruiser was renamed after the capital city of New South Wales, and was launched on 22 September 1934 by Ethel Bruce, the wife of Stanley Bruce, former Prime Minister of Australia and the serving Australian High Commissioner to the United Kingdom. Sydney was commissioned into the RAN on 24 September 1935, <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> ship's company from Brisbane, which had been decommissioned earlier that day.|$|E
5|$|In Japan, D.Gray-man {{has been}} put on hiatus many times; once due to Hoshino falling seriously ill with Norovirus and another because of an injury to her neck. However the series {{continued}} shortly after in both cases. In November 2008, Weekly Shōnen Jump announced that Hoshino was again putting the series on hold due to an injured wrist. Publication resumed in March 2009. The series once again went on hiatus on May 11. The series resumed in the seasonal magazine Akamaru Jump on August 17, 2009. Following the release in Akamaru Jump, D.Gray-Man resumed its serialization on November 4, 2009 in the monthly-release Japanese manga magazine, Jump Square. Additionally, Hoshino was one of the multiple manga authors that celebrated the 10th anniversary of the manga series Naruto by <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> own rendition of the main character, Naruto Uzumaki.|$|E

25|$|Naoko Takeuchi {{developed}} the Sailor Moon anime for one season. Due to the season's popularity, Toei Animation asked Takeuchi to keep <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> manga. At first, she struggled with developing another storyline {{to extend the}} series due to Toei's request. The basic idea of the second season, introducing the daughter of Sailor Moon from the future, came from her editor, Fumio Osano. Sailor Moon is adapted from the 52 chapters of the series {{which was published in}} Nakayoshi from 1991–1997 and was directed by Junichi Satō, Kunihiko Ikuhara and Takuya Igarashi. It premiered in Japan on TV Asahi on March 7, 1992, taking over the timeslot previously held by Goldfish Warning!, and ran for 200 episodes until its conclusion on February 8, 1997.|$|E
25|$|Kahlo {{spent the}} late 1920s and early 1930s {{traveling}} in Mexico and the United States with Rivera {{who was working}} on commissions. During this time, she developed her own style as an artist, <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> main inspiration from Mexican folk culture and painting mostly small self-portraits, which mixed elements from pre-Columbian and Catholic mythology. Although always overshadowed by Rivera, her paintings raised the interest of Surrealist artist André Breton, who arranged {{for her to have}} her first solo exhibition at the Julien Levy Gallery in New York in 1938. The exhibition was a success and was followed by another in Paris in 1939. While the French exhibition was less successful, the Louvre purchased a painting from Kahlo, making her the first Mexican artist to be featured in their collection.|$|E
25|$|Caroline Shawk {{was born}} on April 28, 1840 in Cincinnati, Ohio. Her father, Abel Shawk, {{manufactured}} fire engines and steam locomotives, and invented a fire engine– the first successful one which was powered by steam. She showed her artistic talents as a young child, enjoying painting and <b>drawing.</b> <b>Her</b> first sculpting project, modeled in clay from a creek, was Dante's head. At the age of twelve, she won a medal for her wax flowers. She graduated from the St. Louis Normal School in 1862, and later that year married railroad worker Samuel H. Brooks. The Brookses initially lived in Memphis, Tennessee, where Samuel's railroad job was located. They later lived in Mississippi for a short time, before moving in 1866 to a farm near Helena, in Phillips County, Arkansas. The couple had one child, a daughter named Mildred.|$|E

25|$|In the women's race, {{history was}} made as Australia claimed all three podium spots {{for the first}} time, all who coincidentally had the first name Emma. Moffatt claimed her first win since the 2009 Grand Final, <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> level with Paula Findley for total series wins at five. Moffatt {{defeated}} reigning world under-23 champion Jackson and 2008 Olympic Champion Snowsill into second and third. In the race itself, Lucy Hall of Great Britain led the swim with Nicola Spirig and Snowsill. Hall was caught on the first lap of the bike section as a peloton of 35 formed at the front. Moffatt led out of the final transition whilst Snowsill and Jackson started slower, but soon caught up. With five kilometres to go, the Australians were joined by New Zealand's Andrea Hewitt. In the final kilometre, Moffatt kicked away for the win whilst Jackson out-sprinted Snowsill for second. At the halfway point in the series with Findley missing, Díaz with a sixth-place finish {{was able to take}} the series lead, 97 points in front, with Hewitt and Moffatt third and fourth overall.|$|E
500|$|Fun Home {{is drawn}} in black line art with a gray-blue ink wash. Sean Wilsey wrote that Fun Homes panels [...] "combine the detail and {{technical}} proficiency of R. Crumb with a seriousness, emotional complexity and innovation completely its own." [...] Writing in the Gay & Lesbian Review Worldwide, Diane Ellen Hamer contrasted [...] "Bechdel's habit of <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> characters very simply and yet distinctly" [...] with [...] "the {{attention to detail}} that she devotes to the background, those TV shows and posters on the wall, {{not to mention the}} intricacies of the funeral home as a recurring backdrop." [...] Bechdel told an interviewer for The Comics Journal that the richness of each panel of Fun Home was very deliberate: ...|$|E
500|$|Through the years, she {{has come}} to be {{regarded}} as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear [...] "Do you want me to go to Anna with this?" [...] when they have differences with her subordinates. The Guardian has called her the [...] "unofficial mayoress" [...] of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protégée at Vogue, Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> settings from New York's fashionable élite.|$|E

500|$|Final Fantasy XIII-2 {{was first}} hinted at {{three months after}} the January 2010 release of Final Fantasy XIII. Kitase said in an {{interview}} [...] "If we could do a XIII-2, we could direct all our attention to the story and refine what we have already built." [...] Toriyama stated in the October 2010 Ultimania Omega companion book that he hoped to continue the story. Two months later, Nomura released a drawing of Lightning along with the words [...] "She must not be forgotten". On January 11, 2011, Square Enix registered the domain name FinalFantasy13-2game.com via a proxy company that it had used to register websites for several other unannounced games. Final Fantasy XIII-2 was officially announced at the Square Enix 1st Production Department Premier in Tokyo on January 18, 2011. The teaser trailer showed Lightning, outfitted in armor, <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> weapon and engaging Caius, who was not yet named. To promote the game's release in Japan, Japanese singer Yuko Oshima was appointed the leader of a group of thirteen official test players.|$|E
500|$|When {{designing}} Sakura, Kishimoto {{focused on}} her silhouette and created a costume as simple as possible. This is a divergence from the other main characters of the series, whose costumes are very detailed. The leggings are the most notable aspect of her design, as they are meant to show that she is very active. At {{the start of the}} series her leggings extended below her knees and closely resembled trousers. As Part I progressed, the leggings became increasingly shorter and tighter. Similar to his inexperience with drawing heroines, Kishimoto lacked the experience needed to make Sakura [...] "cute" [...] when he first began <b>drawing</b> <b>her.</b> Although he implies that her appearance has become cuter since then, Kishimoto and much of the Naruto manga staff agree that Sakura was [...] "far from cute" [...] {{at the start of the}} series. In retrospective, he found Sakura one of the hardest character to draw alongside Sasuke. Kishimoto first planned Sasuke and Sakura's romance in early production of Naruto. In regards to Sakura's feelings to Sasuke, Kishimoto tried to write them as realistic as possible but ended getting complaints from young girls about her.|$|E
500|$|The {{design for}} Marceline {{was created by}} Ward, with small changes and {{additions}} added by Phil Rynda, former lead character and prop designer for Adventure Time. Visually, Marceline has long, dark hair. She rarely walks on the ground, generally preferring to float when she travels, moves, and sleeps. Marceline, unlike {{many of the other}} characters, wears varying outfits in most of her appearances. According to Ward, her clothing changes from episode to episode because [...] "girls own more than one outfit". Olson was impressed by her character's fashion design stating, [...] "she has really cool style [...] I love what they come up with [...] every episode." [...] Olson explained that when she goes in to record the voices for each episode, she is [...] "totally surprised" [...] by the costuming for Marceline. While she says her lines, she is able to view the animatics for the episode and sometimes has to stop to admire the unique designs. Marceline's physical size and shape slightly changes depending on who is <b>drawing</b> <b>her.</b> Rynda later called this [...] "one of the coolest parts" [...] about the character's animation {{due to the fact that}} [...] "every artist leaves a little bit of their own taste and sensibilities in what they draw." ...|$|E

500|$|Niffenegger is {{an artist}} {{who teaches at the}} Center for Book and Paper Arts at Columbia College Chicago, where she prepares editions of handpainted books. She {{produced}} some of her earlier works in editions of ten copies, which were sold in art galleries. However, she decided that The Time Traveler's Wife {{would have to be a}} novel: [...] "I got the idea for the title, and when I draw I have this big drawing table covered with brown paper, and I write ideas down on the paper. So I wrote down this title and after a while I started to think about it. I couldn't think of a way to make it a picture book because still pictures don't represent time very well, so I decided to write a novel." [...] She was intrigued by the title because [...] "it immediately defined two people and their relationship to each other". Niffenegger said that its source was an epigraph to J. B. Priestley's 1964 novel Man and Time: [...] "Clock time is our bank manager, tax collector, police inspector; this inner time is our wife." [...] <b>Drawing</b> <b>her</b> central theme from this image, she says, [...] "Henry is not only married to Clare; he's also married to time." [...] Other authors whom Niffenegger has cited as influencing the book include Richard Powers, David Foster Wallace, Henry James, and Dorothy Sayers.|$|E
500|$|In {{the face}} of the East Prussian Offensive, the Germans tried to {{strengthen}} the localities they controlled against great odds. In a diary entry dated 16 January 1945, Shanina wrote that despite her wish to be in a safer place, some unknown force was <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> to the front line. In the same entry she wrote that she had no fear and that she had even agreed to go [...] "to a melee combat." [...] The next day, Shanina wrote in a letter that she might {{be on the verge of}} being killed because her battalion had lost 72 out of 78 people. Her last diary entry reports that German fire had become so intense that the Soviet troops, including herself, had sheltered inside self-propelled guns. On 27 January Shanina was severely injured while shielding a wounded artillery officer. She was found by two soldiers disemboweled, with her chest torn open by a shell fragment. Despite attempts to save her, Shanina died the following day near the Richau estate (later a Soviet settlement of Telmanovka), [...] southeast of the East Prussian village of Ilmsdorf (...) [...] Nurse Yekaterina Radkina remembered Shanina telling her that she regretted having done so little. By the day of Shanina's death the Soviets had overtaken several major East Prussian localities, including Tilsit, Insterburg and Pillau, and approached Königsberg. Recalling the moment Shanina's mother received notification of her daughter's death, her brother Marat wrote: [...] "I clearly remembered mother's eyes. They weren't teary anymore.... 'That's all, that's all'—she repeated". Shanina was buried under a spreading pear tree on the shore of the Alle River—now called the Lava— and was later reinterred in the settlement of Znamensk, Kaliningrad Oblast.|$|E

2500|$|Millenear Shephield's {{last name}} {{is derived from}} American {{baseball}} player, Gary Sheffield. Woo depicted Deshwitat to be a 28-year-old demon because he is [...] "sick of the 13-17-year-old other pretty boys that seem to populate every other manhwa title out there right now." [...] He also wanted a [...] "manly man" [...] for a lead character. Millenear was planned to be a [...] "useless sidekick hanging around the main character". However, due to the fun in <b>drawing</b> <b>her,</b> Woo hinted {{that she might be}} the female heroine.|$|E
2500|$|Mark Henn {{served as}} the supervising {{animator}} for Tiana. Henn was hired by Lasseter because he had animated nearly every Disney Princess since Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Describing Tiana, Henn said that she is following [...] "a new trend in our princesses," [...] likening her to Ariel from The Little Mermaid. Henn was inspired by studio employee Jaimie Milner, a film intern who was working in post production. The fact that Tiana is African American was [...] "never a big issue" [...] for Henn {{when it came to}} animating her, but <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> as both a human and a frog proved difficult. He said, [...] "Tiana appears in the movie in so many different forms … she's a little girl, she's an adult human, and then she's a frog".|$|E
2500|$|Ann Kipling (born 1934 in Victoria, British Columbia, Canada) is a Canadian {{artist who}} creates impressionistic portraits and landscapes on paper from direct observation. [...] Kipling's {{distinctive}} style of overlapping, temporally suggestive linework is formed through her working process, which involves <b>drawing</b> <b>her</b> subject over time, recording subtle shifts in {{movement in the}} sitter or landscape during that period. Her work {{is characterized by a}} flat sense of space, where lines are used to frame a vibrating and gestural idea of her subject, rather than a direct representation of form. While not directly connected to any art movement in particular, connections can be made to Chinese landscape painters and the watercolours of Paul Cézanne. Using colour minimally, her primary media is etching, drawing, watercolours, pen, pencil, pastels and pencil crayons. She lives and works in Falkland, BC, a location which serves as a focus for her recent landscapes.|$|E
