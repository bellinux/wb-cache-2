5|$|Mortality {{rates in}} the russet sparrow have not been studied, but it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> many young birds die from Isospora infections, to which the bird has little resistance. Other {{recorded}} parasites of the russet sparrow include Protocalliphora blowflies, and Menacanthus chewing lice.|$|E

5|$|A {{military}} operation {{plan for the}} invasion of Ireland in support of Operation Sea Lion was drawn up by the Germans in August 1940. Occupied Ireland was to be ruled along with Britain in a temporary administrative system divided into six military-economic commands, {{with one of the}} headquarters being situated in Dublin. Ireland's future position in the New Order is unclear, but it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Hitler would have united Ulster with the Irish state.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} rare feature {{found on}} Motul de San José ceramics {{is the so-called}} X-ray style, showing a figure wearing a mask but also portraying his face underneath it. All the other representations using this rare style are depicted on Late Classic sculptures at sites with which it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Motul de San José had contact at this time, including Dos Pilas, Machaquila, Tikal and Yaxchilan. This X-ray style has been found on at least nine painted vessels from Motul de San José and is also used {{on the west side}} of Stela 2.|$|E

5|$|According to Sharon, {{there is}} no mention of Deir Ghassaneh or Beit Rima in early Arabic sources, {{although}} it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Deir Ghassaneh was inhabited during the Mamluk period due to the many houses there that have preserved elements of Mamluk architecture. Specific examples include the use of the ablaq technique of alternating stones of different colors, particularly red and white, that decorate the facades and gates of some houses.|$|E
5|$|As Petty gets {{further into}} his investigation, Rost's answers become more evasive. Petty {{suspects}} that Eric actually kills women for his snuff films, a suspicion further exacerbated when Rost {{says that he}} will relay Petty's contact information to the women instead of giving their contact information to Petty. It is not clear at the film's end whether Rost's films are actual snuff in the fictional subplot's context. However, it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he spies on {{them for a long}} period of time before asking them to participate.|$|E
5|$|As with written records, {{the archaeological}} {{evidence}} for this period is not extensive, {{and knowledge of the}} daily lives of the population is lacking. It <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the Hebrides were taxed using the Ounceland system and evidence from Bornais suggests that settlers there may have been more prosperous than families of a similar status in the Northern Isles, possibly owing to a more relaxed political regime. Latterly, the Hebrides sent eight representatives from Lewis, Harris and Skye and another eight from the southern Hebrides to the Tynwald parliament on Man.|$|E

5|$|Estimates {{for total}} death toll range from 55 to 153. Death toll {{estimates}} for Texas range from 17 to 38, though official records {{indicate that the}} 38 deaths occurred in Mexico rather than Texas. Estimates of the deaths in Mexico, where records are less complete, vary more widely. Several of the deaths in Texas were homeless people attempting to enter the United States, {{and as a result}} their deaths were not counted. Monetary damage figures are not available, but it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> flooding from Alice caused considerable damage to crops, primarily cotton.|$|E
5|$|From Han {{literary}} sources, it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> wooden-trestle beam bridges, arch bridges, simple suspension bridges, {{and floating}} pontoon bridges existed in Han China.

60|$|This, I say, {{and it is}} {{important}} to note it, <b>was</b> what they <b>knew</b> at half-past seven. Of course as each hour went past they learned more and more. At eight o'clock it <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Pupkin <b>was</b> not dead, but dangerously wounded in the lungs. At eight-thirty it <b>was</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he <b>was</b> not shot in the lungs, but that the ball had traversed the pit of his stomach.|$|R

5|$|From ancient sources, such as Chinese oracle bones, it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> their {{appearances}} {{have been}} noticed by humans for millennia. Until the sixteenth century, comets were usually considered bad omens of deaths of kings or noble men, or coming catastrophes, or even interpreted as attacks by heavenly beings against terrestrial inhabitants.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} as many as 256 {{soldiers}} of the First Maryland Regiment under Colonel William Smallwood fell in the battle, about two-thirds of the regiment. It <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> they were buried in a mass-grave, but the grave's exact location has been a mystery for 240 years. In 2012 Brooklyn historian and president of the Brooklyn Preservation Council, Robert Furman, stated that he had a strong suspicion of the location of the gravesite, believing it to be in an empty lot in the Gowanus section of Brooklyn.|$|E
5|$|How Robertet {{obtained}} {{such a large}} plot in {{the centre}} of Blois is unknown; he may have acquired the land gradually for the building's future construction, or could have been granted a fief by the Crown for his services. Although, it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> Robertet sought to acquire an adjoining building (the Hôtel Denis-Dupont) to extend his property. Lawyer Denis Dupont (the building's owner) strongly opposed the idea, and {{over half of the}} former Hôtel Denis-Dupont remains.|$|E

5|$|In the Byzantine Empire, {{slaves were}} {{employed}} {{until the end}} of the Empire, as were eunuchs. Little is known of the living arrangements of the Byzantines, as very few buildings remain.

Ine may not have recovered any of the lands north of the Thames {{that had belonged to}} the West Saxons under previous kings, but it <b>is</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> he controlled the southern bank: a charter dated 687 shows him giving land to the church at Streatley on the Thames and at nearby Basildon.|$|E
