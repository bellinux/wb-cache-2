40|$|The {{present study}} is {{concerned}} chiefly with {{the behavior of a}} <b>duplicating</b> <b>chromosome</b> derived from the undescribed scute allelomorph known as scute- 10 - 2. This allelomorph, obtained by x-raying scute- 10, is associated with a reciprocal 1 - 4 translocation. The X-chromosome is broken near its left end, between the loci of silver and broad, and the short terminal piece (loci from yellow to silver) is exchanged for a section of the fourth chromosome that includes all the known loci of that chromosome (with the possible exception of cubitus-interruptus, which is difficult to test, since this translocation shows the position effect recently described by Dubinin and Sidoroff(1)). The small chromosome, made up of the left end of X attached to the spindle-fibre region of 4, may be obtained in individuals (of either sex) that are otherwise normal diploids. (2) If the normal X's of such hyperploids carry the recessive gene for yellow, the flies are wild-type in appearance {{because of the presence of}} +y in the <b>duplicating</b> <b>chromosome.</b> This fact has been used, in the present experiments, to study the distribution of the fragment at meiosis...|$|E

The markers comprised only chromosome 21 material. Karyotypes were near-diploid and, besides dup(21), no other established chromosomal changes were observed. A total of 20 patients, 1. 5 and < 0. 5 % among consecutive series of childhood and adult ALL respectively, showed this phenomenon.

40|$|Despite recent {{progress}} in visualization experiments, the mechanism underlying chromosome segregation in bacteria still remains elusive. Here we address a basic physical issue associated with bacterial chromosome segregation, namely the spatial organization of highly confined, self-avoiding polymers (of nontrivial topology) in a rod-shaped cell-like geometry. Through computer simulations, we present evidence that, under strong confinement conditions, topologically distinct domains of a polymer complex effectively repel {{each other to}} maximize their conformational entropy, suggesting that <b>duplicated</b> circular <b>chromosomes</b> could partition spontaneously.

40|$|During {{eukaryotic}} cell division, the sister chromatids of <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are pulled apart by microtubules, which connect via kinetochores. The kinetochore is a multiprotein structure that links centromeres to microtubules, and that emits molecular signals {{in order to}} safeguard the equal distribution of <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> over daughter cells. Although microtubule-mediated chromosome segregation is evolutionary conserved, kinetochore compositions seem to have diverged. To systematically inventory kinetochore diversity and to reconstruct its evolution, we determined orthologs of 70 kinetochore proteins in 90 phylogenetically diverse eukaryotes. The resulting ortholog sets imply that the last eukaryotic common ancestor (LECA) possessed a complex kinetochore and highlight that current-day kinetochores differ substantially. These kinetochores diverged through gene loss, duplication, and, less frequently, invention and displacement. Various kinetochore components co-evolved with one another, albeit in different manners. These co-evolutionary patterns improve our understanding of kinetochore function and evolution, which we illustrated with the RZZ complex, TRIP 13, the MCC, and some nuclear pore proteins. The extensive diversity of kinetochore compositions in eukaryotes poses numerous questions regarding evolutionary flexibility of essential cellular functions...|$|R

40|$|This article {{presents}} a physical biology approach to understanding organization and segregation of bacterial chromosomes. The author uses a "piston" analogy for bacterial chromosomes in a cell, {{which leads to}} a phase diagram for the organization of two athermal chains confined in a closed geometry characterized by two length scales (length and width). When applied to rod-shaped bacteria such as Escherichia coli, this phase diagram predicts that, despite strong confinement, <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> will demix, i. e., there exists a primordial physical driving force for chromosome segregation. The author discusses segregation of <b>duplicating</b> <b>chromosomes</b> using the concentric-shell model, which predicts that newly synthesized DNA will be found in the periphery of the chromosome during replication. In contrast to chromosomes, these results suggest that most plasmids will be randomly distributed inside the cell because of their small sizes. An active partitioning system is therefore required for accurate segregation of low-copy number plasmids. Implications of these results are also sketched, e. g., on the role of proteins, segregation mechanisms for bacteria of diverse shapes, cell cycle of an artificial cell, and evolution.

40|$|In yeast, meiotic {{recombination}} {{between a}} linear chromosome III and a haploid-viable circular chromosome will yield a dicentric, tandemly <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosome.</b> Spores containing apparently intact dicentric chromosomes were recovered from tetrads with three viable spores. The spore containing the dicentric inherited URA 3 (part of the recombinant DNA used to join regions near {{the ends of}} the chromosome into a circle) as well as HML, HMR and MAL 2 (located near the two ends of a linear but deleted from the circle). The Ura+ Mal+ colonies were highly variegated, giving rise to as many as seven distinctly different stable ("healed") derivatives, some of which were Ura+ Mal +, others Ura+ Mal- and others Ura - Mal+. The colonies were also sectored for five markers (HIS 4, LEU 2, CRY 1, MAT and THR 4) initially heterozygous in the tandemly <b>duplicated</b> dicentric <b>chromosome.</b> —Southern blot and genetic analyses have demonstrated that these stable derivatives arose from mitotic break-age of the dicentric chromosome, followed by one of several different healing events.

50|$|In all {{parthenogenetic}} reptile species {{studied to}} date, chromosomal evidence supports {{the theory that}} parthenogenesis arose through a hybridization event, although members of the genus Lepidophyma may be exceptions to this rule. The original hybridization event is believed to occur between two related species and is often followed by backcrossing to either parent species to create triploid parthenogenetic offspring. As no crosses of two sexual species in captivity have ever produced parthenogenetic offspring, {{it is unclear how}} a hybridization event would actually lead to asexual reproduction. It is possible that parthenogenesis evolved as a way of overcoming sterility due to improper chromosomal pairing and segregation during meiosis in hybrids, and that rare hybrid individuals that could premeiotically <b>duplicate</b> their <b>chromosomes</b> could escape hybrid sterility by reproducing through parthenogenesis. The ability to premeiotically <b>duplicate</b> <b>chromosomes</b> would be selected for in this scenario as it would be the only option for successful reproduction.|$|R

40|$|During mitosis, cells {{segregate}} <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> {{with high}} fidelity {{in order to}} maintain genome stability. Proper attachment of sister kinetochores to spindle microtubules is critical for accurate chromosome segregation and is driven by complex mechanisms that promote the capture of unattached kinetochores and the resolution of erroneously attached kinetochores.

40|$|Most cells {{within an}} {{organism}} function {{while they are}} in a non-dividing state. Cells enter the division cycle to initiate tissue growth or to repair damaged tissue. In the last phase of this cycle, M-phase, cytoplasmic division (cytokinesis) is accomplished after, in case of dividing human cells, 23 pairs of <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> are separated during nuclear division (mitosis). Faithful chromosome segregation is essential as gains and losses of chromosomes are a hallmark of cancer. To ensure fidelity of chromosome segregation microtubules coming from opposite spindle poles have to attach to kinetochores (microtubule binding interfaces of the chromosomes) in a bipolar fashion in order to pull apart the <b>chromosome</b> <b>duplicates</b> to opposite poles of the cell. The Chromosomal Passenger Complex (CPC), consisting of Aurora B kinase, Borealin, Survivin and INCENP, plays a pivotal role in the protection of genome stability as it coordinates equal segregation of the <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> with cytokinesis. In mitosis the CPC members Borealin and Survivin direct the complex to the inner centromere (the region where the <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> connect). Borealin associates with histone H 2 A phosphorylated on threonine 120 by Bub 1 via a Shugoshin intermediate, while Survivin interacts with histone H 3 phosphorylated at threonine 3 by Haspin. When cells enter mitosis, spindle microtubules are captured by kinetochores and the activity of Aurora B is critical to specifically detach those kinetochore-microtubule attachments that are not bi-polar (error correction), and when left uncorrected could give rise to chromosome mis-segregations in anaphase. The resulting unattached kinetochores activate the mitotic checkpoint, a surveillance mechanism that prevents the segregation of the <b>duplicated</b> <b>chromosomes</b> until all chromosomes have acquired bi-polar attachments. While the role of Aurora B in error correction was undisputed, its direct contribution to mitotic checkpoint signaling remained controversial. Our data show that besides generating unattached kinetochores as a result of error correction, Aurora B promotes rapid establishment of the mitotic checkpoint via kinetochore recruitment of the checkpoint kinase Mps 1. Moreover, we found that impaired kinetochore recruitment of Mps 1 underlies the mitotic checkpoint defects observed in cells expressing an INCENP mutant lacking its coiled coil domain. Our data further suggest that INCENP links Aurora B to the centromere recruitment subunits Survivin and Borealin, with the coiled coil domain supporting Aurora B in reaching its distant kinetochore substrates. The inner centromere localization of the CPC is essential for its proper functioning and we identified the pathways that direct this localization in space and time. Besides Aurora B being important for Mps 1 kinetochore recruitment, we show that Mps 1 in turn stimulates the Bub 1 -H 2 Aph-Sgo 1 recruitment axis for centromere accumulation of Aurora B. Moreover, Aurora B activity enhances its own recruitment by phosphorylation of Haspin, thereby promoting its activity towards histone H 3 -T 3, the other CPC centromere recruitment mark. We suggest that when cells enter mitosis, the feedback loops between Aurora B and Mps 1 respectively Aurora B and Haspin direct timely inner centromere accumulation of the CPC to ensure effective establishment of the error correction and the mitotic checkpoint machineries, required for accurate nuclear division...|$|R
