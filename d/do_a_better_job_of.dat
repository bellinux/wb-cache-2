5|$|The total {{incompetence}} of the D.C. {{government in}} Washington, DC, {{has become an}} embarrassment to our entire Nation. This experiment in home rule is a disaster. All of us who serve in this Chamber, well over 95% of us, have held other positions in government. We have been mayors. We have been township trustees, State legislators, and the rest.

500|$|... "Save the Last One" [...] was {{critically}} acclaimed by television critics. IGN's Eric Goldman praised the episode, {{giving it a}} nine out of ten, signifying an [...] "amazing" [...] rating. He opined {{that it was his}} favorite episode since the series' pilot episode, [...] "Days Gone Bye", and added that [...] "it had scary zombie scenes, good action, interesting character interaction and a revelation at the end that gave us a whole lot to process." [...] John Serba of The Grand Rapids Press was split on [...] "Save the Last One"; while asserting that it was [...] "imminently watchable", he felt that the episode was unbalanced as a whole and criticized the dialogue. Serba wrote: [...] "The show continues to display a disproportionate amount of dialogue compared to the development of its characters. It needs to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> biding its time between crowd-pleasing zombie attacks." [...] HitFix's Alan Sepinwall echoed similar thoughts, opining, [...] "the characters need more depth. The show seems to be setting itself out to be a slow-burning character study {{in the context of a}} zombie apocalypse — and with enough chase scenes and other scares to entice folks who just want brain-eating action — and the characters need to be more complex than they've been shown to be so far." ...|$|E
500|$|All {{tickets for}} the Wonder World Tour were sold {{exclusively}} through paperless ticket delivery, meaning that fans did not receive a physical concert ticket for their entry into the event. Ticket buyers were required to bring the credit card {{used to make the}} purchase and photo identification to the concert venue in order to gain entry. All groups were to enter the concert together, and ushers issued seat locator slips. The method of ticket sales was relatively new at the time, although Ticketmaster first experimented it with AC/DC's Black Ice World Tour (2008–10). However, it marked the first time for an arena tour to sell all tickets through paperless ticketing. This was done in response to the extensive ticket scalping that occurred during the Best of Both Worlds Tour and in order to give fans the opportunity to purchase good tickets at face value. Cyrus' manager and president of Morey Management Group, Jason Morey, stated, [...] "The focus was, 'How do we take all the information we gathered last time out and <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> it?' It was important to us {{to address the issue of}} demand. We thought that of every single option that was available out there, this was a really viable option, to go with the paperless ticketing." [...] As with the Best of Both Worlds Tour, one dollar from each ticket purchased was donated to the City of Hope National Medical Center, a center dedicated to the prevention, treatment and research for the cure of cancer.|$|E

2500|$|Q {{factor is}} a {{parameter}} {{that describes the}} resonance behavior of an underdamped harmonic oscillator (resonator). [...] Sinusoidally driven resonators having higher Q factors resonate with greater amplitudes (at the resonant frequency) but have a smaller range of frequencies around that frequency for which they resonate; the range of frequencies for which the oscillator resonates is called the bandwidth. Thus, a high-Q tuned circuit in a radio receiver would {{be more difficult to}} tune, but would have more selectivity; it would <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> filtering out signals from other stations that lie nearby on the spectrum. High-Q oscillators oscillate with a smaller range of frequencies and are more stable. (See oscillator phase noise.) ...|$|E

And (2) when a student not only knows that his or her own peer grading efforts are being examined by peers, but he or she is also given a number of other peer grading efforts to evaluate (so the peer graders see how other peer graders evaluate assignments), do both of these together tend to motivate the student to <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> when grading assignments?

2500|$|When it debuted, Fallen Angels {{received}} mixed {{to critical}} notices. In his review for the Associated Press, Scott Williams wrote, 'We're {{asking a lot}} of TV to deliver entertainment about that stylish, moral abyss. Fallen Angels delivers. It lets us look over the edge and measure our souls against the darkness". The Chicago Sun-Times gave the series two out of four stars and Ginny Holbert wrote, [...] "Part {{of the problem is}} the series' arch, self-conscious obsession with style. Instead of a '90s interpretation of film noir, [...] "Fallen Angels" [...] offers contrived, full-color cliche noir, replete with cocked fedoras, plumes of curling smoke and harsh sunlight sliced by venetian blinds". In his review for The New York Times, John J. O'Connor called it, [...] "uneven but diverting, even when just hovering around film-school level". In his review for the Houston Chronicle, Louis B. Parks wrote, [...] "The big problem with film noir homages is they usually overdo the ingredients, with none of the subtlety of the great originals. Fallen Angels has a touch of that. But the directors and actors play straight, and the adaptations, taken from the real McCoy writers, are pretty good stuff". In his review for the Washington Post, Tom Shales wrote, [...] "Creating period pieces out of their period seems to be fairly easy now for the gifted artisans of Hollywood. Even by today's commonplace high standards, however, {{the look and feel of}} the six Fallen Angels films seem transportingly authentic and sensuous, stylized in ways that evoke the milieu without spoofing it. Occasionally, the films veer into the arch and ridiculous, but overall, they at least look darn good". Newsweek magazine's David Gates wrote, [...] "no show this summer will <b>do</b> <b>a</b> <b>better</b> <b>job</b> <b>of</b> whisking you away from the increasingly unacceptable '90s. These half hours are all too short". Entertainment Weekly magazine's Lisa Schwarzbaum wrote, [...] "One unintended result of all this happy, naughty cigarette-puffing, however, is that, at their weakest, these films look like the work of boys (and don't be fooled, this is a boys' fantasy production) dressed up in their dads' big suits".|$|E
