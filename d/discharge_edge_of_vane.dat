The performance and efficiency <b>of</b> a submerged <b>vane</b> is related to its shape. In the present study, physical hydraulic model testing is performed to investigate four shapes of vanes: a simple rectangular vane and three vanes that are beveled at leading edge in 30, 45 and 60 degrees {{with respect to the}} base, respectively. The experiments show that cutting the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vanes</b> reduces the local scour around the vanes.

The original sample, obtained before the gravity table separation, and four fractions (heavy, medium heavy, medium light, and light) obtained from the <b>discharge</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> each gravity table, were analyzed for physical (bulk density, weight of 100 seeds, volume, specific gravity, terminal velocity, purity, breakage susceptibility, and pericarp injury), physiological (standard germination, cold germination, conductivity, and field emergence), and chemical composition (NIR protein, oil, and starch contents);Both gravity tables performed similarly as determined by the seed quality of various fractions. Flat seed corn was better in seed quality than round seed corn. The gravity table was efficient in separating seed corn into fractions of different quality along the <b>discharge</b> <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the gravity table deck. However, when the initial seed quality of a lot is high, only marginal improvement in seed quality was obtained. The light seed obtained from the low side of the gravity table did not meet the seed requirement and must be discarded. The medium light fraction may be re-conditioned to recover fractions of acceptable seed quality. Bulk density was the best physical property of the seed corn correlated with the physiological quality of the seed. Weight of 100 seed may be also used, but bulk density is preferable due to its higher relationship with field emergence than seed weight...|$|R

Comparison with the undamaged turbine stage reveals that the amplitudes of certain modes increase due to the damage.

40|$|In situ reheat is an {{alternative}} to traditional gas turbine reheat design in which fuel is fed through airfoils {{rather than in a}} bulky discrete combustor separating HP and LP turbines. The goals are to achieve increased power output and/or efficiency without higher emissions. In this program the scientific basis for achieving burnout with low emissions has been explored. In Task 1, Blade Path Aerodynamics, design options were evaluated using CFD in terms of burnout, increase of power output, and possible hot streaking. It was concluded that Vane 1 injection in a conventional 4 -stage turbine was preferred. Vane 2 injection after vane 1 injection was possible, but of marginal benefit. In Task 2, Combustion and Emissions, detailed chemical kinetics modeling, validated by Task 3, Sub-Scale Testing, experiments, resulted in the same conclusions, with the added conclusion that some increase in emissions was expected. In Task 4, Conceptual Design and Development Plan, Siemens Westinghouse power cycle analysis software was used to evaluate alternative in situ reheat design options.

The effect of the secondary flow on head loss {{can be divided into}} two parts. The first part causes a loss which can be measured immediately behind the vanes, while the second part causes a loss which occurs between the trailing <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vanes</b> and a plane about 4 duct hydraulic diameters behind the miter line of the bend.

The results of the research conducted on the original compressor indicated the compressor would not meet the desired engine-design air-flow requirements because of an air-flow restriction in the vaned collector. The compressor air-flow choking point occurred near the entrance to the vaned-collector passage and was instigated by a poor mass-flow distribution at the vane entrance and from relatively large negative angles of attack of the air stream along the entrance <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vanes</b> at the outer passage wall and large positive angles of attack at the inner passage wall.

40|$|Variable {{inlet guide}} vane (VIGV) is used to control the mass flow and {{generate}} prewhirl in centrifugal compressors. Due to the tip clearance <b>of</b> the guide <b>vanes</b> and the defect of the traditional guide vane profiles, the mass flow regulation of VIGV is limited, resulting in a large waste of compressed gas. Two kinds of inlet flow channels were proposed to eliminate the influence of tip clearance. These structures were numerically investigated at different setting angles.

Ten kinds <b>of</b> guide <b>vane</b> profiles, including different thickness distribution, camber line profile, were selected to compare with the original one and with each other.

50|$|A partial {{explanation}} is that gas molecules hitting the warmer side <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> will pick {{up some of the}} heat, bouncing off the vane with increased speed. Giving the molecule this extra boost effectively means that a minute pressure is exerted on the <b>vane.</b> The imbalance <b>of</b> this effect between the warmer black side and the cooler silver side means the net pressure on the vane is equivalent to a push on the black side, and as a result the vanes spin round with the black side trailing. The problem with this idea is that while the faster moving molecules produce more force, they also {{do a better job of}} stopping other molecules from reaching the vane, so the net force on the vane should be exactly the same — the greater temperature causes a decrease in local density which results in the same force on both sides. Years after this explanation was dismissed, Albert Einstein showed that the two pressures do not cancel out exactly at the <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vanes</b> because <b>of</b> the temperature difference there. The force predicted by Einstein would be enough to move the vanes, but not fast enough.|$|R

Since all-ceramic turbine vanes would be a very large and risky development step, Westinghouse is considering to protect the leading <b>edges</b> <b>of</b> turbine <b>vanes</b> with high-performance ceramics. This might be done by either replacing the leading edge with a suitably shaped ceramic part, or by modifying the vanes such that they can accommodate ceramic inserts. Among the most important criteria for the success of ceramics in such applications are (a) thermodynamic compatibility with the turbine vane alloy, (b) sufficient thermal shock resistance to survive the thermal cycling during operation and in particular during emergency shut-down, and a design considering the thermal expansion mismatch of the metallic and ceramic components.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the work aiming for tonal noise reduction in a centrifugal fan. In previous studies, {{it is well}} documented that tonal noise is the dominant noise source generated in centrifugal fans. Tonal noise is generated due to the aerodynamic interaction between the rotating impeller and stationary diffuser <b>vanes.</b> The generation <b>of</b> tonal noise {{is related to the}} pressure fluctuation at the leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the stationary <b>vane.</b> The tonal noise is periodic in time which occurs at the blade passing frequency (BPF) and its harmonics. Much of previous studies, have shown that the stationary vane causes the tonal noise and generation of non-rotational turbulent noise. However, omitting stationary vanes will lead to the increase of non-rotational turbulent noise resulted from the high velocity of the flow leaving the impeller. Hence {{in order to reduce the}} tonal noise and the non-rotational noise, guide vanes were designed as part of this study to replace the diffuser vanes, which were originally used in the chosen centrifugal fan. The leading <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the guide <b>vane</b> is tapered. This modification reduces the strength of pressure fluctuation resulting from the interaction between the impeller outflow and stationary vane. The sound pressure level at blade passing frequency (BPF) is reduced by 6. 8 dB, the 2 nd BPF is reduced by 4. 1 dB and the 3 rd BPF reduced by about 17. 5 dB. The overall reduction was 0. 9 dB. The centrifugal fan with tapered guide vanes radiates lower tonal noise compared to the existing diffuser vanes. These reductions are achieved without compromising the performance of the centrifugal fan. The behavior of the fluid flow was studied using computational fluid dynamics (CFD) tools and the acoustics characteristics were determined through experiments in an anechoic chamber...|$|R

In order to improve numerical predictions of the complex endwall flow, benchmark quality experimental data are required. To this purpose, this study documents the endwall heat transfer and static pressure coefficient distribution of a modern stator vane for two different exit Reynolds num-bers (Re ex = 6 x 105 and 1. 2 x 106). In addition, laser Doppler velocime-ter measurements of all three components of the mean and fluctuating velocities are presented for the stagnation plane in the leading edge re-gion. Results indicate that the endwall heat transfer, pressure distribu-tion and flowfield characteristics change with Reynolds number. The endwall pressure distributions show that lower pressure coefficients oc-cur at the higher Reynolds number due to secondary flows. The stronger secondary flows cause enhanced heat transfer near the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> at the higher Reynolds number. On the other hand the mean velocity, turbulent kinetic energy and vorticity results indicate that lead-ing edge vortex is stronger and more turbulent at the lower Reynolds number.

The nozzle pressure ratio ranged from 4 to 6. The results indicated that a vane nozzleing effect developed at nozzle pressure ratios of 4 and 6 when the outer and lower vanes were deflected far enough into the flow field such {{that the increase in}} vane area accelerated the flow past the vanes causing distorted shock waves.

40|$|High {{fidelity}} simulations, e. g., large eddy simulation {{are often}} needed for accurately predicting pressure losses due to wake mixing in turbomachinery applications. An unsteady adjoint of such high fidelity simulations {{is useful for}} design optimization in these aerodynamic applications. In this paper we present unsteady adjoint solutions using a large eddy simulation model for a vane from VKI using aerothermal objectives. The unsteady adjoint method is effective in capturing the gradient {{for a short time}} interval aerothermal objective, whereas the method provides diverging gradients for long time-averaged thermal objectives. As the boundary layer on the suction side near the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the <b>vane</b> is turbulent, it poses a challenge for the adjoint solver. The chaotic dynamics cause the adjoint solution to diverge exponentially from the trailing edge region when solved backwards in time. This results in the corruption of the sensitivities obtained from the adjoint solutions. An energy analysis of the unsteady compressible Navier-Stokes adjoint equations indicates that adding artificial viscosity to the adjoint equations can potentially dissipate the adjoint energy while potentially maintain the accuracy of the adjoint sensitivities.

Stationary rods were placed upstream of the cascade in four phase locations to model the unsteady wake formed at the trailing <b>edge</b> <b>of</b> the upstream <b>vane.</b> Delta wings were also placed in four positions to create a vortex similar to the passage vortex at the exit <b>of</b> the <b>vane.</b> The film cooling effectiveness distributions were measured using pressure-sensitive paint (PSP). Reducing the width of the slot was found to decrease the area of coolant coverage, although the film cooling effectiveness close to the slot was slightly increased. The unsteady wake was found to have a trivial effect on platform cooling, while the passage vortex from the upstream vane may significantly reduce the film cooling effectiveness...|$|R
