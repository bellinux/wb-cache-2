Chem. Phys. 113 (2000) 1535] recorded using high-resolution Fourier transform and intracavity laser absorption spectroscopies. A total of 62 bands, with 32 newly reported ones, are observed from the lowest energy band, v 7 at 626. 16 cm- 1 up to 4 v 1 at 13284. 1 cm- 1. Among these bands, 43 are firmly assigned, and 16 tentatively. Effective vibrational constants are obtained. The normal modes of vibrations are further characterised using ab initio calculations providing fundamental band intensities and picturing normal mode nuclear displacements. The effective investigation of the rotational structure in the first CH stretch overtone band (2 v 2) {{and in the second}} OH stretch overtone band (3 v 1) is detailed.

40|$|Prototypical hydrogen-bonded and halogen-bonded systems give unique {{insight into}} the {{characteristics}} of weakly interacting systems. Spectroscopic analysis of <b>fundamental,</b> <b>combination,</b> and hot bands {{of these types of}} systems has yielded structural properties, molecular dynamics and other molecular parameters. The experimental results from the gas-phase spectroscopy were compared with the results of compound-model morphed potentials. Experimental spectroscopic analysis was accomplished through the application of a near infrared quantum cascade laser (QCL) based spectrometer to a continuous wave supersonic slit jet expansion with several different combinations of CO and HX (X= F, Cl, Br, I, CN, CCH) species. Spectroscopic analysis of <b>fundamental,</b> <b>combination</b> and hot bands of the CO stretching vibrations provided rovibrational parameters for low frequency intermolecular vibrations. Investigation into the blue frequency shifts in the complexes of the C-O vibrations permitted comparison of the strength and of the resulting effects of the hydrogen and halogen bonding within the systems. Structural properties and other molecular parameters of OC-HCN were compared with corresponding properties predicted using morphed potentials for the homologous series OC-HX (X = F, Cl, Br, I). Analysis of ? 2, ? 2 +? 7 ^ 1 ?? 7 ^ 1, ? 2 +? 7 ^ 1, and ? 2 +? 6 ^ 1 vibrations in OC-HCN enabled the generation of a 5 -dimensional semi-empirical intermolecular potential. A five-dimensional compound-model morphed potential was also generated for the halogen-bonded intermolecular interaction OC-BrCl, which could then be compared with the alternatively hydrogen-bonded dimers OC-HX (X = F, Cl, Br) giving further {{insight into the}} nature of these types of interactions. A new spectrometer was designed to enable the study of DI. The ? 1 spectra of OCDI and OC-ID, as well as ? 2 of OC-DI and OC-ID have been recorded using a quantum cascade laser pulsed slit supersonic jet spectrometer with an astigmatic multipass cell. The results confirmed the prediction of ground state deuterium isotopic isomerization, originally proposed by using a generated morphed potential. Finally, another new quantum cascade laser spectrometer was designed to utilize a continuous wave supersonic slit jet expansion with an astigmatic multipass cell. The spectrum of Ar-NO was recorded over the region 1856. 8 - 1887. 4 cm^- 1 followed by the recording of the NO-H 2 O spectra in this region, both of which had never before been recorded in these regions and are open-shell systems...|$|E

This <b>fundamental</b> <b>combination</b> of biological evolution and development {{has served as}} an inspiration for novel engineering design methodologies, with the goal to overcome the scalability problems suffered by classical top-down approaches. Top-down methodologies {{are based on the}} manual decomposition of the design into modular, independent subunits. In contrast, recent computational morphogenetic techniques have shown {{that they were able to}} automatically generate truly complex innovative designs. Algorithms based on evolutionary computation and artificial development have been proposed to automatically design both the structures, within certain constraints, and the controllers that optimize their function. However, the driving force of biological evolution does not resemble an enumeration of design requirements, but much rather relies on the interaction of organisms within the environment. Similarly, controllers do not evolve nor develop separately, but are woven into the organism’s morphology. In this chapter, we discuss evolutionary morphogenetic algorithms inspired by these important aspects of biological evolution. The proposed methodologies could contribute to the automation of processes that design “organic” structures, whose morphologies and controllers are intended to solve a functional problem. The performance of the algorithms is tested on a class of optimization problems that we call behavior-finding. These challenges are not explicitly based on morphology or controller constraints, but only on the solving abilities and efficacy of the design. Our results show that morphogenetic algorithms are well suited to behavior-finding...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe changes {{which have}} {{occurred}} since the pre-standard ENV 1997 - 1 {{and the present}} need to calibrate the national links to Eurocode 7 (standard EN 1997 - 1), call for operational methods for comparing the safety levels and for calibrating the partial factors.

An adjusting method is first proposed and allows the assessment of the resistance model factor γRd which, used together with the values of the partial factors recommended in design approach 2 of EN 1997 - 1, yields the same safety levels as Fascicule 62 -V. For the calculation from ground test results, a probabilistic calibration of the partial resistance is also performed by means of a series of pile tests; the question of the safety levels to take into account with the <b>fundamental</b> <b>combination</b> is debated: the use of the « design values » method of Annex C of Eurocode: Basis of design (standard EN 1990) would give excessively safe results when compared to common practice; an « inverse method » is used which goes back to a subjacent target probability of failure, referring to partial factors proposed in the reviewed codes of practice.

Many participants on an intermediate level lacked a sufficient background in mathematics and quantum mechan­ ics, and it became evident that a non mathematical or nearly nonmathe­ matical approach would be necessary.

40|$|The {{investigation}} considers {{issues associated}} with transient regime of nonlinear bubble oscillations. The nonlinear response of a gas bubble to a low frequency pumping wave results in parametrically-generated shape oscillations above a well-defined threshold. This may be detected through insonification of the bubble by a high-frequency imaging wave, leading to the subharmonic and <b>fundamental</b> <b>combinations</b> frequency signals. The duration of the transient regimes of these two signals are very different. In this study the complete theory of the transient processes near the threshold of excitation of distortion modes has been derived. The detection of the subharmonic component is a general characteristic of cavitation and other nonlinear phenomena in liquids containing phase inclusions. As first observed by Neppiras, a small subharmonic component is also observed below threshold, so that the growth of this spectral component is not, strictly speaking, of a threshold character. The explanation proposed involves the analysis of transient processes near a subharmonic resonance. In this domain the ring up times of fundamental frequency signal can be greater than {{the duration of the}} pump pulse, and the corresponding component in the radiation spectrum can be interpreted as the appearance of subharmonic component below threshold...|$|R

The system involves three independent parameters: the frequency and amplitude of the periodic exitation and a parameter of the dissipative forces, the last two being assumed small.

For an arbitrary periodic exitation matrix and a positive-definite matrix of the dissipative forces, general expressions are obtained for the domains of <b>fundamental</b> and <b>combination</b> resonances. Two special cases of the periodic exitation matrix, frequently encountered in applications, are studied: a symmetric matrix, and a time-independent matrix multiplied by a scalar periodic function.

Principal absorption bands exhibited by adularia at wavenumbers of 362 and 345. 5 mm^(− 1) (corresponding to O-H stretching modes) are strongly dichroic, with maximum and minimum absorptivities measured for vibrations α (E at 5 ° to a) and β (E at 5 ° to c^∗), respectively, whereas bands at 328 and 309 mm^(− 1) are more nearly isotropic. Similarly, near-infrared bands at 525 and 513 mm^(− 1) (associated with combination H-OH bend, O-H stretch modes) exhibit maximum peak heights for α while a lesser band at 475 mm^(− 1) appears to be nearly isotropic. Comparison of <b>fundamental</b> and <b>combination</b> band intensities reveal that molecular water is the predominant hydrogen-bearing species, consistent with previous results for microcline and orthoclase crystals in which H_ 2 O substitutes for K. However, differences in magnitude of <b>fundamental</b> and <b>combination</b> band polarizations suggest multiple defect sites or potentially a secondary population of hydroxyl defects. Rates at which these defects can be eliminated from samples annealed in air at temperatures T from 500 ° to 900 °C are much faster than those predicted by oxygen mobilities, yielding diffusivities of D[/_s]= 6. 2 x 10 ^(- 4) exp (-l 72 ± 15 [^(kJ) /mol)) /RT indistinguishable from those reported for proton interstitials in quartz.

We undertook a systematic study of the spectral reflectance properties of ammonium-bearing minerals and compounds that have possible planetary relevance (i. e., ammonium carbonates, chlorides, nitrates, oxalates, phosphates, silicates, and sulfates). Various synthetic and natural NH 4 +-bearing minerals were analyzed using reflectance spectroscopy in the long-wave ultraviolet, visible, near-infrared, and mid-infrared regions (0. 35 - 8 mu m) {{in order to identify}} spectral features characteristic of the NH 4 + molecule, and to evaluate if and how these features vary among different species. Mineral phases were confirmed through structural and compositional analyses using X-ray diffraction, X-ray fluorescence, and elemental combustion analysis. Characteristic absorption features associated with NH 4 {{can be seen in the}} reflectance spectra at wavelengths as short as similar to 1 mu m. In the near-infrared region, the most prominent absorption bands are located near 1. 6, 2. 0, and 2. 2 mu m. Absorption features characteristic of NH 4 + occurred at slightly longer wavelengths in the mineral-bound NH 4 + spectra than for free NH 4 + for most of the samples. Differences in wavelength position are attributable to various factors, including differences in the type and polarizability of the anion(s) attached to the NH 4 +, degree and type of hydrogen bonding, molecule symmetry, and cation substitutions. Multiple absorption features, usually three absorption bands, in the mid-infrared region between similar to 2. 8 and 3. 8 mu m were seen in all but the most NH 4 -poor sample spectra, and are attributed to <b>fundamentals,</b> <b>combinations,</b> and overtones of stretching and bending vibrations of the NH 4 + molecule. These features appear even in reflectance spectra of water-rich samples which exhibit a strong 3 mu m region water absorption feature. While many of the samples examined in this study have NH 4 absorption bands at unique wavelength positions, in order to discriminate between different NH 4 +-bearing phases, absorption features corresponding to molecules other than NH 4 + should be included in spectral analysis. A qualitative comparison of the laboratory results to telescopic spectra of Asteroids 1 Ceres, 10 Hygiea, and 324 Bamberga for the 3 mu m region demonstrates that a number of NH 4 -bearing phases are consistent with the observational data in terms of exhibiting an absorption band in the 3. 07 mu m region.

This improves accuracy of water estimates over modeling the water content using specific water bands (principally, 1. 4 and 1. 9 m) since these bands are susceptible to saturation by atmospheric water vapor beneath airborne and satellite platforms. In contrast, our soil moisture Gaussian model (SMGM) provides an accurate measure of soil moisture for use with other band metrics in spectral mixture analysis or classification and regression classification models for mapping mineral abundance of surface soils. The improvement contributed by the SMGM parameter to estimates of clay an...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} anharmonic {{vibrational analysis}} of cis- 1 -chloro- 2 -fluoroethylene and its isotopomers has been {{performed on the}} basis of a complete ab initio quartic force field constructed by means of second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP 2) and the coupled-cluster singles and doubles approach, augmented for structural optimization and harmonic force field by a contribution of connected triple excitations (CCSD(T)). The theoretical force field was scaled by global least-squares fitting to all spectroscopic data and parameters experimentally determined for this molecule. This final force field, employing standard perturbation theory, yields a complete set of spectroscopic molecular constants providing a critical assessment of experimental rotational and centrifugal distortion constants, <b>fundamentals,</b> overtones, and <b>combination</b> bands determined over many years. Effects of Fermi and Darling-Dennison resonances were included by matrix diagonalization...|$|R
