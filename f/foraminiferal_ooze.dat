According to William Sager, a professor of marine geophysics at the University of Houston in Texas, the surface of ocean bottom covered with <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> is soft enough to squeeze between a person's toes, but it's not so soft that airplane wreckage would sink into it. He stated: [...] "Something big like pieces of an airplane, it's {{going to be sitting}} on the surface." [...] In addition, Robin Beaman, a marine geologist at James Cook University, Queensland, Australia, noted that any large metallic object lying on an ocean bottom covered by <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> would be readily recognizable on an autonomous underwater vehicle's sidescan sonar. Sidescan sonar can be quite good at differentiating the acoustic return of a hard, metallic object compared to that of an ocean floor covered by ooze.|$|E
50|$|The first {{drilling}} of the Messinian salt at {{the deeper}} {{parts of the}} Mediterranean Sea came {{in the summer of}} 1970, when geologists aboard the Glomar Challenger brought up drill cores containing arroyo gravels and red and green floodplain silts; and gypsum, anhydrite, rock salt, and various other evaporite minerals that often form from drying of brine or seawater, including in a few places potash, left where the last bitter, mineral-rich waters dried up. One drill core contained a wind-blown cross-bedded deposit of deep-sea <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> that had dried into dust and been blown about on the hot dry abyssal plain by sandstorms, mixed with quartz sand blown in from nearby continents, and ended up in a brine lake interbedded between two layers of halite. These layers alternated with layers containing marine fossils, indicating a succession of drying and flooding periods.|$|E
40|$|Sediment cores {{collected}} {{in and around}} the Ross Sea, Antarctica, are described and discussed based on sedimentological data, such as visual descriptions, sedimentary structures, magnetic susceptibility, sand contents, and water content. On the Ross Sea Continental Shelf, the core sequences contain two lithologic units, soft diatomaceous mud in the upper and compound glacio-marine sediments in the lower. The lower lithologic unit suggests that highly ice-sheet influenced sedimentation existed in glacial times in the Ross Sea. The core sequences on the continental slope and deep-sea basins off the Ross Sea comprise <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze,</b> siliceous mud, and terrigenous mud, sometimes with laminated parts. The laminated parts of the core sequences suggest that strengthened bottom water influenced sedimentation, probably in glacial times.

Their content is inversely proportional to total content of organic matter. Relative content of low-polar compounds in total amount of lipids and content of hydrocarbons, fatty acids, and sterols {{in the composition of}} these compounds can serve as an index of degree of transformation of organic matter in sediment because these compounds are resistant to various degree to microbial and hydrolytic decomposition and, consequently, are selectively preserved under conditions of biodegradation of organic compounds during oxydation-reduction processes...|$|R
40|$|Phosphate {{deposits}} {{which apparently}} formed during the Miocene climatic optimum are widespread on the Chatham Rise and Camp bell Plateau, and on seamounts {{in the north}} Tasman Sea.

The phosphorites of the rise and plateau were formed where current activity was sufficiently strong to prevent normal sedimentation, and now form lag deposits. After the Miocene, phosphorite formation ceased and was followed by manganese oxide deposition where conditions were highly oxidising on the eastern Campbell Plateau and north Tasman seamounts, and by glauconite formation in the much less oxidising environments of the western Campbell Plateau and the Chat ham Rise.

40|$|In the 1960 s Oberhauser and Fuchs (palaeontologists {{working at}} the Geologische Bundesanstalt in Vienna) {{described}} a range of new taxa from the Triassic of Austria that {{were thought to be}} the eariiest planktonic foraminifera. The first reactions of the palaeontological community were negative but in the subsequent forty years our knowledge of Jurassic planktonic foraminifera has expanded considerably. A thorough re-evaluation of the Oberhauser and Fuchs collections in Vienna has shown that these species are probably not planktonic and that the first planktonic taxa appeared in the Toarcian. This origination in the centre of Western Tethys was followed by a rapid expansion of planktonic foraminifera throughout Peri-Tethys. This expansion is dominated by the genera Conoglobigerina and Globiiligerina and while some believe that their separation is straightforward (based on apertural characters) analysis of large assemblages shows that this differentiation is not reliable and requires flirther analysis not only of holotypes, paratypes and topotypes but of large assemblages.

(55 ° 29 ’S- 02 ° 05 ’W, American-Antarctic Ridge). In both occurrences, the talc-rich rocks are associated with serpentinized peridotites, gabbroic rocks and minor basalts. The two rocks have very similar trace element, particularly rare earth element, distributions. The St. Paul F. Z. samples are breccias consisting of angular clasts of botryoidal/colloform talc in a subordinate <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> sediment. These breccias probably formed {{by the collapse of}} fragile structures formed by the precipitation of talc at hydrothermal vents. Talc formed when seawater mixed with hydrothermal fluids from a mafic-ultramafic reaction zone. The talc-rich hydrothermal rock found at the Conrad F. Z. shows evidence of a replacement origin. We suggest the protolith was a gabbroic rock that underwent multi-stage hydrothermal alteration, possibly in a shear zone. These two occurrences represent an evidence of off-axis ocean floor hydrothermal activity, and the study of similar, apparently minor, products collected by dredging could be used to reveal the presence of hydrothermal systems in such impervious settings...|$|E
40|$|Twenty-seven surface {{samples of}} {{biogenic}} sediment, including radiolarian, nannofossil, and <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>oozes</b> from the Western Equatorial Pacific have been analyzed for potassium, magnesium, iron, rubidium, strontium, barium, chromium, cobalt, nickel, copper, and zinc by rapid instrumental techniques.

The variables considered include elemental determinations, water depth, and percentage of calcium carbonate. The associations calcium carbonate: strontium, potassium: rubidium, and barium: nickel: copper may all be explained with regard to their mode of entry into the sediment. The data indicate that organic fixation of metals is a significant process during the deposition of Pacific Equatorial sediments, whereas contributions from other sources, i. e., sorbed cations on the surfaces of clay~ and coprecipitation with iron or manganese oxides, are effectively masked in most cases by high rates of biogenous deposition...|$|R
40|$|A {{new species}} of the cold-temperate austral amphipod genus Carangolia (Gammaridea: Urothoidae) is {{described}} from bathyal depths of the Bay of Biscay (north-east Atlantic). It was occasionally sampled in the south-eastern part of the Bay with sledges towed over muddy bottoms between 522 and 924 m water depth. This depth range falls mainly below the mud-line where the proportion of organic carbon increases {{in response to the}} deposition of silts and/or clay sediment. Most specimens were sampled by the lower net of the sledges, indicating a close association with the bottom. Abundance was relatively low, ranging between 0. 18 and 4. 90 ind 100 m- 2, latter recorded below 700 m depth. The unusual massive appearance of Carangolia mandibles and its preference for bathyal <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>oozes</b> suggest that it is a specialized foraminifer consumer.

The boundary succession includes an uppermost Maastrichtian white to very pale orange, slightly indurated nannofossil ooze overlain by lowermost Paleocene grayish orange <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> The boundary between the uppermost Maastrichtian and the lowermost Paleocene is clearly bioturbated. The contact surface is irregular, and pale orange burrows extend 10 cm into the white Maastrichtian ooze. Preliminary investigations conducted on board revealed that the deepest sections of these burrows yielded highly abundant, minute planktonic foraminiferal assemblages dominated by Guembelitria with rare Hedbergella holmdelensis and Hedbergella monmouthensis, possibly attributable to the lowermost Paleocene Zone P 0. The substantial thickness of the uppermost Maastrichtian Micula prinsii (CC 26) nannofossil Zone and the lowermost Danian Parvularugoglobigerina eugubina (Palpha) foraminiferal Zone suggested that the K/P boundary was rather expanded compared {{to the majority of}} deep-sea sites (see Bralower, Premoli Silva, Malone, et al., 2002, doi: 10. 2973 /odp. proc. ir. 198. 2002).

The sediment cores to the east and west of the plateau contain red clay but the top of the plateau is covered with <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> Mineral grains and rock fragments in cores and dredge hauls from the east escarpment indicate that basic igneous rocks underlie a ridge that forms the eastern edge of the plateau north of 13 °S.

Most of the botton photographs show evidence of deep-sea currents. The plateau's shape is apparently controlled by faulting although much evidence of basic vulcanism is present in the cores.

40|$|Planktic foraminifers are marine protozoans with {{calcareous}} Shells and chambered tests. They {{first appeared}} in the mid-Jurassic and spread since the mid-Cretaceous over all the world’s oceans. Modern planktic foraminifers evolved since the early Tertiary, when the first spinose species occurred. Most species live in the surface to sub-thermocline layer of the open ocean, and in marginal seas like the Mediterranean, Caribbean, South China Sea, and Red Sea. Planktic foraminifers are absent in shallow marginal seas, for example, the North Sea. Planktic foraminifers respond to food, temperature and chemistry of the ambient seawater. Species abundance varies according to seasons, water masses, and water depths. Symbiont-bearing species depend on light and are restricted to the euphotic zone. Planktic foraminifers constitute a minor portion of total Zooplankton, but are major producers of marine calcareous particles (shells) deposited on the ocean floor where they form the so-called <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> Planktic foraminifers contribute substantially to the fossil record of marine Sediments and are of high ecologic, paleoceanographic, and stratigraphic significance since the mid-Cretaceous. Radiocarbon (14 C) gives an absolute age of shell formation within late Pleistocene and Holocene Sediments. Factors that determine the modern faunal composition are applied to Interpretation of the fossil assemblages, for example, by multiple regression techniques (transfer functions) to yield an estimate on ancient environmental parameters.

40|$|Organic petrological and geochemical {{analyses}} were performed on samples cored on Broken Ridge and Ninetyeast Ridge in the Central Indian Ocean during Leg 121. Organic carbon (Corg) contents are less than 1 % in each individual sample and average Corg values calculated for larger stratigraphic units are less than 0. 2 %. Generally, there is more organic matter in Cretaceous sediments than in Tertiary. In the Cretaceous, {{the bulk of the}} organic matter consists of terrigenous debris, but a significant contribution of marine-derived organic matter was found in some samples, especially in the early Maestrichtian on Broken Ridge (Site 754). The youngest Pliocene-Pleistocene sediments at Site 758 (northern part of Ninetyeast Ridge) contain a significant amount of clastic material transported to the site by the (distal) Bengal Fan. In these sediments, Corg contents of up to 0. 9 % were measured and are due to the inflow of terrigenous organic debris. Corg values are positively correlated with bulk sediment accumulation rates (i. e., sediments contain more organic matter at times of faster deposition). The size of terrigenous organic particles is generally small in all sediments. The extremely small number of particles in the Cretaceous sediments at Site 758 and their smaller grain size, compared to the Cretaceous sediments on Broken Ridge, indicate that Cretaceous surface water paleocurrents flowed from southeast to northwest in the Proto-Indian Ocean. In the central Indian Ocean, sediments deposited above the carbonate compensation depth consist of nannofossil and <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>oozes.</b> In contrast to Corg values, calcite contents in the sediments are negatively correlated with bulk sediment accumulation rates (i. e., carbonate oozes were deposited only during times of extremely slow sedimentation). Therefore, older sediments deposited in the young and still narrow Indian Ocean accumulated faster and are less carbonate-rich than Neogene sediments, although carbonate accumulation rates were higher...|$|R

But the existence of strong bottom currents over the tops and slope scarps limits, and at some places reduces to zero, sedimentation of any pelagic particles. At such areas there are formed thick iron-manganese crusts.

40|$|One {{important}} goal of Leg 177 of the Ocean Drilling Program (ODP) {{was to explore}} {{the nature of the}} mid-Pleistocene climate transition (MPT) on the southern hemisphere. A suitable MPT record was encountered at Site 1090 in the southeastern South Atlantic, where a 44 -m-thick sequence of Quaternary diatom-bearing <b>foraminiferal</b> muds and <b>oozes</b> was recovered on the Agulhas Ridge. Environmental responses to the MPT comprised changes in terrestrial climate, biological productivity, and regional ocean circulation, as inferred from compositional sediment data and clay mineralogy. A shift towards more arid conditions occurred between 900 and 800 ka in southern Africa. Changes in palaeoceanography already started earlier. Since 1150 ka, northward displacements of the Polar Front appeared during glacial periods and shifted the area of dominant diatom deposition towards Site 1090. Likewise, glacial-interglacial contrasts in regional conveyor circulation strengthened after 1200 ka and became most severe after 650 ka. However, while changes in regional conveyor circulation likely responded in tune with global ice-volume changes and show the onset of 100 -kyr cycles after 1200 ka, an unusual 130 -kyr pattern characterises the pattern of frontal movements between 1200 ka and 650 ka, probably in response to imperfect adaptation of regional climate to the global 100 -kyr climate cycles...|$|R
40|$|Detailed {{information}} about the sediment properties and microstructure can be provided through the analysis of digital ultrasonic P wave seismograms recorded automatically during full waveform core logging. The physical parameter which predominantly affects the elastic wave propagation in water-saturated sediments is the P wave attenuation coefficient. The related sedimentological parameter is the grain size distribution. A set of high-resolution ultrasonic transmission seismograms (- 50 - 500 kHz), which indicate downcore variations in the grain size by their signal shape and frequency content, are presented. Layers of coarse-grained <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> can be identified by highly attenuated P waves, whereas almost unattenuated waves are recorded in fine-grained areas of nannofossil ooze. Color -encoded pixel graphics of the seismograms and instantaneous frequencies present full waveform images of the lithology and attenuation. A modified spectral difference method is introduced to determine the attenuation coefficient and its power law a = kF. Applied to synthetic seismograms derived using a "constant Q" model, even low attenuation coefficients can be quantified. A downcore analysis gives an attenuation log which ranges from - 700 dB/m at 400 kHz and a power of n= 1 - 2 in coarse-grained sands to few decibels per meter and n :s; 0. 5 in fine-grained clays. A least squares fit of a second degree polynomial describes the mutual relationship between the mean grain size and the attenuation coefficient.

These rocks comprise a breccia unit beneath a middle Eocene <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> Both geophysical characteristics and the variety of volcanic rocks found {{at the bottom of}} Holes 828 A and 828 B indicate that a very immature breccia or scree deposit was sampled. Basalts are moderately to highly altered, but primary textures are well preserved. Two groups with different magmatic affinities, unrelated to the stratigraphic height, have been distinguished. One group consists of aphyric to sparsely Plagioclase + clinopyroxene-phyric basalts, characterized by high TiO 2 (~ 2 wt%) and low A 12 O 3 (less than 15 wt%) contents, with flat MORB-normalized incompatible element patterns and LREE-depleted chondrite-normalized REE patterns. This group resembles N-MORB. The other group comprises moderately to highly olivine + plagioclase-phyric basalts with low TiO 2 ( 15 wt%) contents, and marked HFSE depletion and LFSE enrichment. Some lavas in this group are picritic, with relatively high modal olivine abundances, and MgO contents up to 15 wt%. Both the basalts and picritic basalts of this group reflect an influence by subduction-related processes, and have compositions transitional between MORB and IAT. Lavas with similar geochemical features have been reported from small back-arc basins such as the Mariana Trough, Lau Basin, Sulu Sea, and the North Fiji Basin and are referred to as back-arc basin basalts. However, regional tectonic considerations suggest that the spreading that produced these backarc basin basalts may have occurred in the forearc region of the southwest-facing island arc that existed in this region in the Eocene...|$|E

Consolidation studies, which relate changes in the coefficients of consolidation, compressibility, and permeability to the overburden pressure, indicate that sediments recovered to 79. 4 mbsf (meters below seafloor) are not significantly consolidated. This may {{be a function of}} total carbonate content, mineralogy, and type of carbonate constituents. The lower total porosity and permeability of Section 101 - 630 B- 2 H- 5 relative to 101 - 630 B- 5 H- 6 and 101 - 630 B- 9 H- 6 are explained in terms of effective fluid flow, total calcium carbonate content, and type of constituents present. Results from triaxial shear testing and direct shear testing indicate that Section 101 - 630 B- 2 H- 5 has a higher degree of cohesion and a higher angle of internal friction (0) than sediment recovered deeper in the section, although angles of internal friction from all three samples are lower than typical angles measured from deep-sea <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> Attempts to compare triaxial shear results qualitatively with measurements of undrained vane shear strength from Hole 630 A suggest that the latter may be meaningless if taken from sediments dependent on overburden pressure to maintain strength. Calculations based on consolidated and drained shear strength suggest that if the sediment column is homogeneous, the slope will be stable to 14 ° of inclination. If the inhomogeneities in the section, such as the turbidite layers known to be present, are weaker than the sediments tested, then the stable slope inclination may be less than that calculated. This is substantiated by the abundance of seismic evidence for slumping, sliding, and imbricate thrusting on this gentle (2 °- 3 °) slope...|$|E
40|$|Uranium {{concentrations}} {{in a large}} number of marine sediment samples of different types with world-wide spatial distribution have been determined using the rapid, precise and nondestructive technique of counting the delayed neutrons emitted during U 235 fission induced with thermal neutrons. Several interesting relationships were apparent. 1) A direct proportionality was observed between percentage of organic carbon and uranium in sediments deposited in an anoxic environment in the Pettaquamscutt River in Rhode Island with concentrations ranging from 7 per cent organic carbon and 7 ppm uranium to 14 per cent organic carbon and 30 ppm uranium. A similar relationship was found in cores of sediments deposited on the Sigsbee Knolls in the Gulf of Mexico. 2) For manganese nodules a direct relationship can be seen between uranium and calcium concentrations and both decrease with increasing depth of deposition. For nodules from 4500 m in the Pacific, concentrations are 3 ppm uranium and 0. 3 per cent calcium compared with 14 ppm uranium and 1. 5 per cent calcium at 1000 m. 3) Relatively high uranium concentrations were observed in carbonates deposited in the deepest parts of the Gulf of Mexico, with the > 88 ? carbonate fraction in Sigsbee Knoll cores having as much as 1. 20 ppm. A model to explain the observed variations must include uranium enrichment in near shore environments via an anoxic pathway, followed by redeposition in a deep ocean environment with dilution either by low-uranium-bearing <b>foraminiferal</b> or silicious <b>oozes</b> or, along the continental margins, dilution with high-uranium-bearing carbonate sands...|$|R
40|$|Chert and {{dolomite}} in sediments {{of coastal}} Marlborough {{occur in the}} detrital units of the Upper Iwitahi Group (Wool shed Formation (WF) and Claverley Sandstone - Late Cretaceous), and in Late Cretaceous – Early Tertiary micritic sediments (<b>foraminiferal</b> nannofossil <b>oozes)</b> of the Amuri Limestone Group (ALG). All sediments were deposited in a NW-SE trending trough. Chert and dolomite are generally restricted to what was the deepest part of the basin. There is a greater volume of chert than dolomite. Two chronologically and stratigraphically separated types of dolomite occur: concretions of aphanitic dolomite in the WF, and phaneritic, rhombic dolomite in beds, lenses, or disseminated in chert or micrite in the ALG. Both dolomite types are moderately well ordered but Ca-rich. Isotopic and elemental analyses indicate all dolomites formed in wholly marine sediments at temperatures < 60 °C, in association with sulphate reduction, in the upper sediment column. Concretions formed from the dolomitization of early diagenetic calcite whereas in the ALG primary depositional carbonate was dolomitized. Mg 2 + was supplied by seawater, with dolomite formation restricted {{by the presence of}} dissolved SO 42 -. Chert formation in the WF is limited. Most chertification occurs in the lower ALG. Chert consists predominantly of quartz with rare opal-CT. SiO 2 concentrations are usually ≥ 90 weight% with all other elements forming trace components, except in detrital-rich cherts where SiO 2 concentrations may be < 90 weight percent. The chert chemistry is consistent with replacement of primary carbonate and the expulsion of carbonate-bound elements from the site of chert formation, effectively diluting noncarbonate-bound insoluble residue. Formation was by precipitation of either opal-CT or quartz depending on SiO 2 saturation conditions. Isotopic analyses indicate formation temperatures similar to those of dolomite. The SiO 2 was initially derived from biogenic sources but large amounts are inferred to have been derived from the underlying WF. Clay mineral transformations in the WF produced SiO 2 -rich pore waters through which ALG sediments are thought to have compacted. Initiation of silica deposition resulted from localized oxidation of the H 2 S produced by SO 42 - reduction. Initially deposited silica provided sites for further chertification. Evidence for early chertification (such as differential compaction) have lead to development of a combined model for dolomite and chert formation in association with SO 42 - reduction. Although chert and dolomite both commenced nucleation early, the initial rate of dolomite crystallization exceeded that of silica. The extent of dolomitization was governed by the SO 42 - concentration in pore waters and by the availability of Mg 2 +. Where SO 42 - concentrations were too high no dolomite formed, only calcite recrystallized. Chertification, although slower than dolomitization, continued after the cessation of dolomite formation, certifying undolomitized beds or parts of beds, and the matrix between dolomite crystals. The extent of chertification was governed by the availability of SiO 2 This model of contemporaneous chert and dolomite formation explains the alternation of chert and dolomite beds, the dissemination of dolomite in chert, and the distribution of chert and dolomite...|$|R
40|$|Upper Miocene <b>foraminiferal</b> nannofossil <b>ooze</b> and chalk from DSDP Hole 552 A in the {{northeast}} Atlantic Ocean have been closely sampled for biostratigraphic, paleomagnetic, and stable-isotopic studies. Sampling at 10 -cm intervals resulted in an uppermost Miocene isotope stratigraphy with a 1000 - to 3000 -yr. resolution. Covariance in benthic (Planulina wuellerstorfi) and planktonic (Globigerina bulloides) foraminiferal d 18 O records is taken as evidence for variability in continental ice volume. Our best estimate is that glacial maxima occurred at - 5. 0 and ~ 5. 5 Ma and lasted no more than 20, 000 yrs. These events probably lowered sea level by 60 m below the latest Miocene average. There is little oxygen-isotope evidence, however, for a prolonged glaciation during the last 2 m. y. of the late Miocene. High- and low-frequency variability in the d 13 C record of foraminifers is useful for correlation among North Atlantic DSDP Sites 408, 410, 522, 610, and 611, and for correlation with sites in other oceans. Similar d 13 C changes are seen in P. wuellerstorfi and G. bulloides, but the amplitude of the signal is always greater in G. bulloides. Variability in d 13 C common to both species probably reflects variability in the d 13 C of total CO 2 in seawater. Major long-term features in the d 13 C record include a latest Miocene maximum (P. wuellerstorfi = 1. 5 per mil) in paleomagnetic Chron 7, an abrupt decrease in d 13 C at - 6. 2 Ma, and a slight increase at - 5. 5 Ma. The decrease in d 13 C at - 6. 2 Ma, which has been paleomagnetically dated only twice before, occurs in the upper reversed part of Chronozone 6 at Holes 552 A and 611 C, in excellent agreement with earlier studies. Cycles in d 13 C with a period of ~ 10 4 yrs. are interpreted as changes in seawater chemistry, which may have resulted from orbitally induced variability in continental biomass. Samples of P. wuellerstorfi younger than 6 Ma from throughout the North Atlantic have d 13 C near lo, on average ~ l per mil greater than samples {{of the same age}} in the Pacific Ocean. Thus, there is no evidence for cessation of North Atlantic Deep Water production resulting from the Messinian "salinity crisis. " Biostratigraphic results indicate continuous sedimentation during the late Miocene after about - 6. 5 Ma at Hole 552 A. Nannofossil biostratigraphy is complicated by the scarcity of low-latitude marker species, but middle and late Miocene Zones NN 7 through NN 11 are recognized. A hiatus is present at - 6. 5 Ma, on the basis of simultaneous first occurrences of Amaurolithusprimus, Amaurolithus delicatus, Amaurolithus amplificus, and Scyphosphaera globulata. The frequency and duration of older hiatuses increase downsection in Hole 552 A, as suggested by calcareous nannofossil biostratigraphy and magnetostratigraphy. Paleomagnetic results at Hole 552 A indicate a systematic pattern of inclination changes. Chronozone 6 was readily identified because of its characteristic nannoflora (sequential occurrences of species assigned to the genus Amaurolithus) and the d 13 C decrease in foraminifers, but its lower reversed interval is condensed. Only the lower normal interval of Chronozone 5 was recognized at Hole 552 A; the upper normal interval and the lowest Gilbert sediment are not recognized, owing to low intensity of magnetization and to coring disturbance. Interpreting magnetic reversals below Chronozone 6 was difficult because of hiatuses, but a lower normally magnetized interval is probably Chronozone 7. Correlation between DSDP Hole 552 A and other North Atlantic sites is demonstrated using coiling direction changes in the planktonic foraminifer Neogloboquadrina. At most sites this genus changed its coiling preference from dominantly right to dominantly left during the late Miocene. At Hole 552 A this event probably occurred about 7 m. y. ago. At the same time, P. wuellerstorfi had maximum d 13 C values. A similar d 13 C maximum and coiling change occurred together in Chron 7 at Hole 611 C, and at Hole 610 E. In sediment younger than - 5. 5 Ma, the coiling of small Neogloboquadrina species is random, but the larger species N. atlantica retains preferential left coiling...|$|R

In the 1960 s Oberhauser and Fuchs (palaeontologists working at the Geologische Bundesanstalt in Vienna) described a range of new taxa from the Triassic of Austria that were thought to be the earliest planktonic foraminifera. The first reactions of the palaeontological community were negative but in the subsequent forty years our knowledge of Jurassic planktonic foraminifera has expanded considerably. A thorough re-evaluation of the Oberhauser and Fuchs collections in Vienna has shown that these species are probably not planktonic and that the first planktonic taxa appeared in the Toarcian. This origination in the centre of Western Tethys was followed by a rapid expansion of planktonic foraminifera throughout Peri-Tethys. This expansion is dominated by the genera Conoglobigerina and Globuligerina and while some believe that their separation is straightforward (based on apertural characters) analysis of large assemblages shows that this differentiation is not reliable and requires further analysis not only of holotypes, paratypes and topotypes but of large assemblages. In Southern Poland, Middle Jurassic limestones in the Pieniny Klippen Belt are described as foraminiferal packstones and represent the first evidence of a <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> on the ocean floor. This indicates that, by the mid-Jurassic, there was an oceanic stratification of the Aragonite and Carbonate Compensation Depths and that the modem ocean system had developed, although the depths of these various layers may have been different to those of the present day. By the Oxfordian a relatively diverse planktonic fauna had expanded throughout Peri- Tethys and, probably, around the globe in the tropics. The fauna expanded further in the early Cretaceous as Gondwana fragmented but data across the important Jurassic to Cretaceous transition is extremely limited and requires further investigation...|$|E
40|$|Sediment cores {{recovered}} during ODP drilling {{operations are}} commonly scanned using a Minolta CM- 2002 spectrophotometer to obtain spectral data. Core processing procedures aboard the JOIDES Resolution require that these spectral data be measured on wet cores. However, {{the effects of}} changing water content on the spectra of marine sediments is unknown. We {{examined the effects of}} changing water content on visible light (VIS) diffuse refiectance spectra for core samples composed of clay to <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze.</b> The spectra of dry powdered samples were measured, then the samples were completely saturated (~ 35 % water content) and spectra were measured at set time intervals as the samples progressively dried. The fully saturated samples were appreciably darker than the initial dry samples. The samples continued to darken during the initial phases of drying until the water content had decreased from 35 % to ~ 20 %. As the water content continued to decrease below 20 %, the samples became progressively lighter and attained spectral values similar to the fully saturated samples at water contents of ~ 17 %. Samples continued to lighten until they were totally dry; however, values never became as light as those of the dry samples prior to initial wetting. Changes in refiectance with decreasing water content are not uniform across the VIS. If the water content is greater than 5 %, the refiectance decrease relative to a dry sample is greater at the red end of the spectrum. However, at water contents of less than 5 %, the spectral curves of the wet and dry sediments are similar in shape, but the wet sediments are still darker. Comparison of these data with data obtained from similar saturation experiments using a coarse-grained beach sand suggest that the initial darkening of the saturated carbonate sediments apparently results frorn changing of the physical properties of the sediment; decreasing the water content apparently rearranges the grains. These studies suggest that maximum information will be obtained when spectral measurements are taken on samples that are allowed to dry as much as possible...|$|E
40|$|Continental margin {{drill core}} and seismic data {{indicate}} that between 3. 0 and 2. 5 Ma, high-latitude climate cooling drove both the West and East Antarctic Ice Sheets towards their present expanded cold polar state. Ice margins developed permanent marine termini with ice shelves. Direct physical sedimentary records of Antarctic Ice Sheet variability (e. g. ice-rafted debris, proximal glacimarine cycles) and more distal ocean records of sea-ice distribution (e. g. diatom palaeoecology), thermohaline circulation (e. g. sortable silt), ocean temperatures (e. g. δ 18 O), frontal dynamics and surface circulation (e. g. palaeoecological assemblages and sea-surface temperature (SST) reconstructions) all show a strong covariance with the 41 kyr cycle in Earth's obliquity between 3 and 1 Ma. Glacial periods are characterised by northward expansion of seasonal sea ice, SSTs up to 6 °C colder than now, equatorward migration of frontal zones by 5 – 10 ° latitude, intensification of zonal westerly winds, invigorated surface circulation (e. g. Antarctic Circumpolar Current) and intensified abyssal currents. These processes lead the δ 18 O ice volume maximum by 3 – 7 kyr, at which time Antarctic Ice Sheets were fully extended onto the continental shelf. Antarctic ice volume changes were in part controlled by the effect of Northern Hemisphere glacio-eustasy on its marine margin, and this mechanism accounts {{for much of the}} orbital variability of the last 2. 6 myr. An enigmatic interval of <b>foraminiferal</b> <b>ooze</b> and coccolith-bearing sediments in Weddell Sea and Prydz Bay sediment cores, together with a bioclastic limestone in the Ross Sea at 1 Ma, imply a significant warming and change in ocean chemistry around the periphery of Antarctica. This event, which occurs within the short normal polarity Jaramillo Subchron in Ross Sea cores, is correlated with warm Marine Isotope Stage 31. The anomalous warming implies an increase of 4 – 6 °C in SST, possible incursion of Subantarctic Surface Waters and depression of the lysocline – an event that is apparently unique in the last 3 myr. The proximal geological record implies a second cooling step occurred at the Mid-Pleistocene Climate Transition (ca. 900 ka). Glacial-interglacial cycles, spanning the last 1 myr, recovered in drill cores from the Ross Sea and Prydz Bay are dominated by coarse-grained, ice-proximal diamicts of cold, polar subglacial affinity. Open-ocean pelagites and hemipelagites are rare on the shelf. The atmospheric temperature and greenhouse gas records from Antarctic ice cores show a pronounced increase in amplitude at the 100 ka periodicity, that is coherent and in phase with marine temperature records, but lags ice volume signal. The records of greenhouse gases from the Dome C ice core show very strong congruence with many features of the temperature record, and are consistent with CO 2 in particular playing a significant role in temperature amplification. This also suggests that the Southern Ocean plays a leading role in controlling the atmospheric concentration of CO 2 on glacial-interglacial time scales. Higher dust flux to Antarctica during glacial maxima compared with warm periods is considered to have radiative affects over Antarctica by providing nutrients (e. g. Fe) to the Southern Ocean promoting higher algal productivity and atmospheric CO 2 drawdown. Most of the variation in total grounded ice volume in Antarctic glacial-cycle ice sheet models is due to expansion and contraction of grounding lines across continental shelves, mostly in the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) Ross and Weddell sectors, and is equivalent to 15 – 20 m of sea level. The East Antarctic Ice Sheet interior responds in the opposite sense, contracting slightly at Northern Hemispheric glacial maxima due to lower model snowfall rates. In general millennial-scale cycles occur in high-resolution Antarctic ice cores, particularly in methane and temperature records. However, they appear lower amplitude and the timing may differ from their Northern Hemisphere counterparts (Dansgaard–Oeschger or D-O events). Although uncertainties between the age of the gas (methane) and the ice enclosing it in ice cores makes evaluation of the precise timing of inter-hemispheric, millennial-scale cycles difficult, some D-O cycles appear to be synchronous. The pattern of millennial-scale variability superimposed on G-I climate cycles in Antarctic ice cores occurs both during and prior to the last 100 kyr cycle. Millennial-scale Antarctic warm periods (A 1 –A 7) are well expressed in SST, sortable silt and δ 18 O records from the southern mid-latitude ocean. One of these events, the Antarctic Cold Reversal, at 14. 2 – 12. 4 ka, is associated with an abrupt cooling of 2 °C in the Southern Ocean, an expansion of ice shelves and sea ice, modest intensification of winds and intensification in deep abyssal inflow along eastern New Zealand through the Pacific gatewa...|$|E
