In the same year, Milliken and fellow Liberal MP John Godfrey introduced the Godfrey-Milliken Bill as a satirical response to the American <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b> The Bill, which would have allowed the descendants of United Empire Loyalists to claim compensation for land seized in the American Revolution, was drafted in response to provisions in the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> which sought to punish Canadian companies for using land nationalised by Fidel Castro's government in Cuba. Godfrey and Milliken gave a twenty-minute presentation on their bill in Washington, D.C. in early 1997, and were greeted with warm applause from local Helms-Burton opponents.|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} the EU-US sanctions {{dispute over the}} <b>Helms-Burton</b> and D’Amato <b>Acts</b> from 1996 to 1998. In this study {{the focus is on}} analysing whether during the santions dispute the US was hastening the end of its favourable unipolar position in the international system due to its own foreign policy choices or whether the dispute qualifies as a balancing attempt by the EU. The systemic level theoretical framework consists of neorealism and sanction studies. Unit level factors are used as explanatory factors without a theory. The general EU-US relationship is used to reflect tendencies stated in the research question. Earlier sanctions and sanctioning patterns are reviewed. The study concludes that the US made a dual error in its decision to impose extraterritorial sanction laws against the EU. Firstly, the US confused the targets of the sanctions laws. Secondly, the US confused its foreign and economic policy strategies. This meant using confrontational economic strategy towards a foreign policy objective. Taken together, the US succumbed to arrogance of power and ended up possibly deteriorating its future systemic position. The EU's response was a twofold implicit balancing. The EU's first reaction was to shield itself against the US sanctions with Blocking Statue and Joint Action and so to protect its sovereignty and retain independent capacity to act. The EU's second implicit balancing reaction was meant to discipline the US against its arrogance of power by initiating a dispute settlement procedure in the WTO. The conclusion is that the sanctions dispute had both the effects of deteriorating the US future position as well as possibly increasing the position of the EU in the future. Yet, the US as an initiator of the sanctions dispute gives more explanatory power to the former. The source material of this study consists of neorealist theories. The most important source has been the edited book of Ethan Kapstein and Michael Mastanduno 'Unipolar Politics'(1999) Also sanction studies have been used. An important source has been 'Feeling Good or Doing Good with Sanctions – Unilateral Economic Sanctions and the US National Interest' (1999) by Ernst Preeg. Endast sammandrag.

25|$|In 1996, Canadian {{politicians}} Peter Milliken (a {{descendant of}} American Loyalists) and John Godfrey sponsored the Godfrey-Milliken Bill, {{which would have}} entitled Loyalist descendants to reclaim ancestral property in the United States which had been confiscated during the American Revolution. The bill, which did not pass the House of Commons, was intended primarily as a satirical response to the contemporaneous American <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b>|$|E
25|$|In 1995, Burton {{authored}} legislation targeting {{foreign companies}} that did business with Cuba. The bill allowed foreign companies to be sued in American courts if, in {{dealings with the}} government of Fidel Castro, they acquired assets formerly owned by Americans. In February 1996, Cuba shot down two small Brothers to the Rescue planes piloted by anti-Castro Cuban-Americans. As part of the White House response to crack down on Cuba, President Clinton signed the <b>Helms–Burton</b> <b>Act</b> into law.|$|E
25|$|In {{cases where}} plaintiffs were not {{eligible}} to file {{claims in the}} Commission's Cuban Claims Program, the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> authorized the United States District Courts, beginning in March 1998, to receive those claims and to appoint the Commission as Special Master to make determinations concerning ownership and valuation of the property at issue in the claims. Since the statute's enactment, however, Presidents Clinton, Bush and Obama have continually waived {{the implementation of the}} right to file Title III actions, citing the need to seek agreement with U.S. trading partners on policy toward Cuba; it remains suspended as of 2014.|$|E
25|$|The United States severed {{diplomatic}} relations with Cuba on 3 January 1961, and imposed a trade embargo on 3 February 1962.The Organization of American States, {{under pressure from the}} United States, suspended Cuba's membership in the body on 22 January 1962, and the U.S. government banned all U.S.–Cuban trade on 7 February. The Kennedy administration extended this ban on 8 February 1963, forbidding U.S. citizens to travel to Cuba or conduct financial or commercial transactions with the country. At first, the embargo did not extend to other countries, and Cuba traded with most European, Asian and Latin American countries and especially Canada. However, the United States later pressured other nations and American companies with foreign subsidiaries to restrict trade with Cuba. Also, the <b>Helms–Burton</b> <b>Act</b> of 1996 makes it very difficult for foreign companies doing business with Cuba to also do business in the United States, forcing them to choose between the two.|$|E
2500|$|Currently, the Cuban embargo is {{enforced}} {{mainly through}} six statutes: the Trading with the Enemy Act of 1917, the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961, the Cuban Assets Control Regulations of 1963, the Cuban Democracy Act of 1992, the <b>Helms–Burton</b> <b>Act</b> of 1996, and the Trade Sanctions Reform and Export Enhancement Act of 2000. The stated {{purpose of the}} Cuban Democracy Act of 1992 is to maintain sanctions on Cuba {{so long as the}} Cuban government refuses to move toward [...] "democratization and greater respect for human rights". The <b>Helms–Burton</b> <b>Act</b> further restricted United States citizens from doing business in or with Cuba, and mandated restrictions on giving public or private assistance to any successor government in Havana unless and until certain claims against the Cuban government were met. In 1999, President Bill Clinton expanded the trade embargo by also disallowing foreign subsidiaries of U.S. companies to trade with Cuba. In 2000, Clinton authorized the sale of [...] "humanitarian" [...] U.S. products to Cuba.|$|E
2500|$|The embargo was {{reinforced}} in October 1992 by the Cuban Democracy Act (the [...] "Torricelli Law") and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the <b>Helms–Burton</b> <b>Act)</b> which penalizes foreign {{companies that do}} business in Cuba by preventing them from {{doing business in the}} U.S. Justification provided for these restrictions was that these companies were trafficking in stolen U.S. properties, and should, thus, be excluded from the United States. However, Obama has tried to lift the embargo, but congress will not allow it.|$|E
2500|$|The <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> {{has been}} the target of {{criticism}} from Canadian and European governments in particular, who object to what they say is the extraterritorial pretensions of a piece of legislation aimed at punishing non-U.S. corporations and non-U.S. investors who have economic interests in Cuba. In the Canadian House of Commons, Helms-Burton was mocked by the introduction of the Godfrey-Milliken Bill, which called for the return of property of United Empire Loyalists seized by the American government {{as a result of the}} American Revolution (the bill never became law). The European Council has stated that it: ...|$|E
2500|$|After Cuba {{shot down}} two unarmed Brothers to the Rescue planes in 1996, killing three Americans and a U.S. resident, a bi-partisan {{coalition}} in the United States Congress approved the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b> The Title III {{of this law}} also states that any non-U.S. company that [...] "knowingly trafficks in property in Cuba confiscated without compensation from a U.S. person" [...] can be subjected to litigation and that company's leadership can be barred from entry into the United States. Sanctions may also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. This restriction also applies to maritime shipping, as ships docking at Cuban ports {{are not allowed to}} dock at U.S. ports for six months. It's important to note that this title includes waiver authority, so that the President might suspend its application. This waiver must be renewed every six months and traditionally it has been.|$|E
2500|$|The Cold War {{ended with}} the {{collapse}} of the Soviet Union in the late 1980s and early 1990s, leaving Cuba without its major international sponsor. The ensuing years were marked by economic difficulty in Cuba, a time known as the Special Period. U.S. law allowed private humanitarian aid to Cuba for part of this time. However, the long standing U.S. embargo was reinforced in October 1992 by the Cuban Democracy Act (the [...] "Torricelli Law") and in 1996 by the Cuban Liberty and Democracy Solidarity Act (known as the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act).</b> The 1992 act prohibited foreign-based subsidiaries of U.S. companies from trading with Cuba, travel to Cuba by U.S. citizens, and family remittances to Cuba. Sanctions could also be applied to non-U.S. companies trading with Cuba. As a result, multinational companies had to choose between Cuba and the U.S., the latter being a much larger market.|$|E

50|$|The United Kingdom had {{previously}} introduced provisions by statutory instrument extending its Protection of Trading Interests Act 1980 (originally {{passed in the}} wake of extraterritorial claims by the U.S. in the 1970s) to United States rules on trade with Cuba. United Kingdom law was later extended to counter-act the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> as well. This included criminal sanctions for complying with certain provisions of the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> whilst in the UK.|$|E

5000|$|Canada {{has been}} {{critical}} of the U.S. trade embargo against Cuba, and strongly objected to the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b> In 1996 Foreign Affairs Minister Lloyd Axworthy stated: [...] "Canada shares the U.S. objectives of improving human rights standards and moving to more representative government in Cuba. But we are concerned that the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> takes the wrong approach. That is why we have been working with other countries to uphold the principles of international law".|$|E

50|$|The Godfrey-Milliken Bill, officially Bill C-339: The American Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Loyalty) Act was a Private Member's Bill {{introduced}} in the Canadian parliament by Liberal MPs Peter Milliken and John Godfrey.

50|$|The <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> was {{condemned}} by the Council of Europe, the European Union, Britain, Canada, Mexico, Brazil, Argentina and other U.S. allies that enjoy {{normal trade relations}} with Cuba.

50|$|At the time, United States law allowed {{humanitarian}} {{aid in the}} form of food and medicine by private groups.

50|$|The European Union {{introduced}} a Council Regulation (No 2271/96) (law binding all member states) declaring the extraterritorial {{provisions of the}} <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> to be unenforceable within the EU, and permitting recovery of any damages imposed under it. The EU law also applied sanctions against US companies and their executives for making Title III complaints.|$|E
50|$|In 1996, he {{and fellow}} Liberal MP Peter Milliken {{introduced}} the Godfrey-Milliken Bill {{a parody of}} the American <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b> The gesture received extensive media coverage including in the United States, where Godfrey was featured on the CBS program 60 Minutes.

50|$|The general {{intent of}} the Act was to {{preclude}} the implementation of US law, {{as it relates to}} restrictions on trade with Cuba, to businesses in Canada. After passage of the US Act, The Cuban Liberty and Democratic Solidarity (Libertad) Act of 1996 (<b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act,</b> Pub.L. 104-114, 110 Stat. 785, 22 U.S.C. §§ 6021-6091) further changes to the Act were approved effective January 1, 1997.|$|E
50|$|In 1996 a Private Member's Bill was introduced, but {{not made}} law, in the Canadian parliament; this law called the Godfrey-Milliken Bill was in {{response}} to the extraterritoriality of the <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act.</b> Godfrey-Milliken was essentially a parody, and would have allowed descendants of United Empire Loyalists who fled the American Revolution to be able to reclaim land and property that was confiscated by the American government in the 1700s.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Helms-Burton</b> <b>Act</b> set up {{stringent}} punishments on {{any business}} or person that profited from property of American businesses {{and people that}} had been seized in the Cuban Revolution.

This included a number of Canadian companies.|$|E
