500|$|The first {{actor to}} be cast was Renee O'Connor as Dr. Jessica Ryan in December 2006; she filmed her first scenes in February 2007. O'Connor had visited her {{personal}} friend and Boogeymans producer Rob Tapert on the New Zealand set, {{where she had}} had a discussion with him about [...] "the differences of having a supernatural demon versus a real person that can come in and be a threat." [...] She concluded the former was scarier. On getting cast in the film and her approach to the character, she stated:I had a contract with Rob Tapert and I just emailed him and said that I really wanted to play this character. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be interesting because it touches back on some of the things I've played as an actress, and that was it. [...] It was so tight in the dialogue, you just have to play with the relationships and find other things going on with the characters to make it seem like there's more depth to what's going on, that there's more of a history between them.|$|E
500|$|Chrissie left Den but was {{eventually}} convinced {{to give their}} marriage another try. Oberman revealed in the Daily Mail that she drew on a famous real-life model to reconcile the dichotomous behaviour of a strong woman taking back her cheating husband: [...] "I based Chrissie on Hillary: an intelligent, attractive woman who was publicly humiliated. People ask why she stays with that awful man. A lot of strong women are like that." [...] She also saw {{the ebb and flow}} of Den and Chrissie's marriage as a reflection of the mental gameplaying that was so prominent in their characterisations: [...] "I think there's a challenge in it, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to be the one who would ultimately tame him." [...] As Den's equal, Chrissie was intended to be a challenge to his propensity for intellectual games, having already outwitted the show's prior , Phil Mitchell (Steve McFadden). Den had seen little threat in his first wife's aptitude, but considered Chrissie to be [...] "as sharp as they come". Indeed, Den's extra-marital dalliances were used by writers to showcase and highlight Chrissie's [...] "strong-willed persona". When Zoe Slater (Michelle Ryan) chastised Den for caring only about Chrissie's reaction should she learn of their affair, Den fired back: [...] "And so should you. You think I've treated you badly? Well you don't have a clue what's going to happen if she ever finds out! The best thing you can do is keep your mouth shut." [...] By the time Chrissie left the Square, Oberman dryly observed that she had [...] "had more fights on EastEnders than most women have in their whole lives." ...|$|E
2500|$|At the time, Bellisario {{said that}} he [...] "kind of [...] what's going on now" [...] {{and that it was}} {{unlikely}} that the relationship would be taken further any time in the immediate future. De Pablo agreed, saying, [...] "I would think if the characters get together, the whole mystery would be done. I {{think it will be a}} lot more fun to play the tension." [...] She elaborated in another interview, [...] "My character has sort of this understated flirtation with Michael's character, Tony. She gets jealous, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> never admit it or hook up with someone in the workplace. He scares her to death. He is the epitome of the American man and all of the things that come out of his mouth are brutally stupid." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "It wouldn't be {{anything}} to wonder at. That Jennie Mason {{seemed to be}} a nice girl, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> stand for any such meanness." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{group has}} been the focus of controversy, both inside and outside the animal rights movement. Newkirk and, formerly, Pacheco are seen as the leading {{exporters}} of animal rights to the more traditional animal-protection groups in the United States, but sections of the movement nonetheless say that PETA is not radical enough—law professor Gary Francione lists the group among what he calls [...] "the new welfarists," [...] arguing that its work with industries to achieve reform, which continues in the tradition of Henry Spira, makes it an animal welfare group, not an animal rights group. Newkirk told Salon in 2001 that PETA works toward the ideal but tries in the meantime to provide carrot-and-stick incentives."What I say to myself all the time is that we have our heads in the clouds looking for Utopia, but we have our feet firmly planted on the ground dealing with reality. We make no bones about the fact that we want an end to all cruelty to animals. But I think the meat industry and the leather industry and the experimenters understand, especially if we're fighting them, that we will back off if they move society and their industry a step forward. We're not going to stop everything overnight, so while we work for the ideal we certainly wish to provide the carrot-and-stick incentives to move along toward that goal."Animals are going to die by the millions today in all sorts of ugly ways for all sorts of ridiculous, insupportable reasons. If one animal who is lying in a battery egg farm cage could have the extra room to stretch her wing today because of something you've done, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> choose to have that happen." [...] There has also been criticism from feminists within the movement about the use of scantily clad women in PETA's anti-fur campaigns and others, but as Norm Phelps notes, [...] "Newkirk has been consistent in her response. No one, she says, is being exploited. Everyone ... is an uncoerced volunteer. Sexual attraction is a fact of life, and if it can advance the animals' cause, she makes no apologies for using it." [...] Also, Phelps notes that some activists believe that the group's media stunts trivialize animal rights, but he qualifies this by saying, [...] "t's hard to argue with success and PETA is far and away the most successful cutting-edge animal rights organization in the world." [...] Newkirk's view is that PETA has a duty to be [...] "press sluts." [...] She argues, [...] "It is our obligation. We would be worthless if we were just polite and didn't make any waves." [...] PETA has also faced criticism for it's targeting of children, such as distributing comic books entitled Your Mommy Kills Animals.|$|E

6000|$|... "But," [...] said Fred, [...] "how does Beatrice {{manage to}} make grandmamma endure such novelties? <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> disdain {{them more than}} the old {{mistress}} herself." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{would never}} consent {{to sell the}} things,--not even to you, Bill; {{and she has been}} so long the head of the house that <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like to--to--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> not. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> only worry herself {{about what}} is before me; and if the doctors let me off easy, I had rather report of myself in person.' ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I am {{anxious to}} know--I {{should like to}} go or send at once to Offendene--but she rides so well, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> keep up--there would most likely be many round her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Much better, indeed; if {{we could}} only raise her spirits, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> recover very well; but she is so sadly depressed. I must {{try to talk to}} Ethel--she may better {{understand}} her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not; Mrs. Arabin may {{get on with}} Mrs. Harold Smith, though I doubt that; but I'm sure she's not fond of Mrs. Smith's brother. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> stay at Chaldicotes." ...|$|R

6000|$|... 'That's a pity,' said Steerforth. 'If you had had one, <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> {{have been}} a pretty, timid, little, bright-eyed sort of girl. I should have liked to know her. Good night, young Copperfield.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I was {{in hopes}} the {{dissolution}} would have carried everybody away," [...] said Lord Montfort rather woefully. [...] "I wish the Queen of Mesopotamia were {{a candidate for}} some borough; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> rather like it." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] I said solemnly. [...] "I shall say nothing. But that, I suppose, {{is because}} I {{am not so}} brave as you are. Really and truly, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> only be amused. Everything amuses her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that," [...] the {{sergeant}} said. [...] "The school enables them to live, but it cannot do much more, so that <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> feel no reluctance at giving that up." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, Cecil, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> oppose it. Indeed, my dear boy, I {{wish you}} happiness, but Esther is a shy, startled little being, {{and away from}} her mother; and perhaps {{you will have to}} be patient." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sanborn mused, [...] "I {{wonder if}} the lovers of any other age had any such scruples about marriage. I guess you're right about Aurelia, but I don't believe you are about the sculptress. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> make you happy." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "How divinely young!" [...] said Colville.

6000|$|... "Not exactly that; I don't {{think that}} would do any good. But you might persuade her to come here. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> come if you advised her; and then, after a bit you might say a good word for Archie." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{it will be}} at the cost of tough work to you; she looked to me too sweet a {{creature}} to have broken her sons in, but <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be pleasant to deal with." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am {{surprised}} that the last should have done so. Anne Marston is such a meek, quiet, peace-loving person, that <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have preferred remaining, as she naturally might have done, without exciting remark, with her own mother." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Gudruda has no {{ship and}} it is late to take the sea. Also <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would</b> let a time go by because of the blood-feud which she has against me {{for the death of}} Björn." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "She {{has always}} desired the marriage. And yet <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> have been {{satisfied}} {{had it been}} otherwise. But of course her heart must be with her brother. I need not have troubled myself to go to Blankenberg after all." ...|$|E
6000|$|Rosier {{gazed into}} his hat; he {{wondered}} whether his hostess HAD been {{after all the}} right person to come to. [...] "I don't think I understand you. I'm an old friend of Mrs. Osmond, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> like me to succeed." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Can’t you spare {{us a few}} minutes?” he said. “Miss Clavier {{seemed to}} like your singing, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> be pleased if you noticed her. When she heard it was a charity she came down for half her usual fee.” ...|$|E

6000|$|... "The only thing," [...] said I, [...] "with {{which you}} may safely trust her. <b>She</b> <b>would</b> unscrupulously damage a husband's purse and property, {{recklessly}} try his patience and temper: <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>she</b> <b>would</b> breathe, or let another breathe, on his honour." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am not sure. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>she</b> <b>would.</b> Sometimes <b>I</b> fancy {{that it is}} only a great {{kindness}} of heart, an immense sympathy, a kind of protective sympathy, which has made her so good to me." ...|$|R
