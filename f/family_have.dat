5|$|In 1917, the Japanese {{astronomer}} Kiyotsugu Hirayama {{began to}} study asteroid motions. By plotting the mean orbital motion, inclination and eccentricity {{of a set of}} asteroids, he discovered several distinct groupings. In a later paper he reported a group of three asteroids associated with Pallas, which became named the Pallas family, after the largest member of the group. Since 1994 more than 10 members of this <b>family</b> <b>have</b> been identified, and these have semi-major axes between 2.50–2.82AU and inclinations of 33–38°. The validity of this grouping was confirmed in 2002 by a comparison of their spectra.|$|E

5|$|Abyssobrotula galatheae, {{a species}} of cusk eel in the family Ophidiidae, is among the deepest-living species of fish. In 1970, one {{specimen}} was trawled from a depth of 8370meters in the Puerto Rico Trench. The animal was dead, however, upon arrival at the surface. In 2008, the hadal snailfish (Pseudoliparis amblystomopsis) was observed and recorded {{at a depth of}} 7700meters in the Japan Trench. These are, to date, the deepest living fish ever recorded. Other fish of the abyssal zone include the fishes of the Ipnopidae family, which includes the abyssal spiderfish (Bathypterois longipes), tripodfish (Bathypterois grallator), feeler fish (Bathypterois longifilis), and the black lizardfish (Bathysauropsis gracilis).

5|$|At {{the age of}} 18, Morenz {{became an}} {{apprentice}} with the Canadian National Railways (CNR) factory in Stratford.

Blake was traded to Montreal in 2012, meaning that all four generations of the Morenz-Geoffrion <b>family</b> <b>have</b> played within the Canadiens organization.|$|E

Later, Bart uses his Bartman powers to stop Jimbo, Kearney, and Dolph from {{stealing}} from the Natural History Museum, Homer uses his ability to become a huge ball and win an eating contest, Lisa uses her powers of meditation to stop a deforestation project, and Marge uses her powers to influence crowds to stop the release of Grand Theft Scratchy in Springfield, although Lisa points out it is ironic she used violence to stop a violent game.|$|E
5|$|Colón {{was born}} in the Santurce {{district}} of the capital of Puerto Rico, San Juan. He is son of retired wrestler and promoter Carlos Colón, Sr. and his wife, Nancy. Colón was the first of four siblings, a group that also includes fellow wrestlers Eddie Colón and Stacy Colón, both of whom have performed in the World Wrestling Council. A second sister, Melissa did not enter the wrestling business. Other members of Colón's <b>family</b> <b>have</b> also been involved in the World Wrestling Council; his uncle José Colón and cousin Orlando Colón have been involved in several angles within the company. On April 18, 2009, Colón was retroactively granted the Canadian citizenship following a series of amends to the Canadian nationality law. This revision automatically granted the distinction to all the first generation individuals born abroad. The revision only required a single Canadian parent, a demand that Colón met through his maternal bloodline.|$|E
5|$|DNK {{carried out}} tests {{with the system}} in 2010 for firefighters using {{self-contained}} breathing apparatus in structure fires, and found the system to be sufficient. Similar test were carried out by Oslo Fire Department later that year, and {{they found that the}} radio system was insufficient for their needs. Oslo Fire Department concluded that the DNK tests were only successful because of the use of additional directional gateway/repeater-radio equipment. Because of this firefighters in Oslo continued to use the old ultra-high frequency radios during indoor fires. Both the Norwegian Police Security Service's bodyguard service and the service for protection of the royal <b>family</b> <b>have</b> opted to not use the new radio system, citing poor coverage indoors and while lying on the ground, even in downtown Oslo. The services have stated that this does not allow for interoperability with other agencies, which is a drawback in case of major incidents. Also the joint rescue coordination centers, the Norwegian Air Ambulance and the 330 Squadron which operates Westland Sea King search and rescue helicopters have opted out of using the system because of poor coverage. During the 2011 Norway attacks at Utøya, located in northern Buskerud, police officers from surrounding police districts were not able to communicate with local police because the area did not have coverage for the TETRA system.|$|E
