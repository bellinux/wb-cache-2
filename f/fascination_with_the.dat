5|$|Despite {{the early}} <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> novel, after the Second World War it fell into neglect as {{critical}} attention to Döblin was directed primarily towards his next novel, Berlin Alexanderplatz (1929), {{and a new}} edition of Berge Meere und Giganten was not published until 1977. The last few decades have however seen a resurgence of critical interest in the novel.|$|E
5|$|Space {{exploration}} {{has been}} an interest since his <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> United States/Soviet Union Space Race during his teenage years. Gingrich wants the U.S. to pursue new achievements in space, such as sustaining civilizations beyond Earth, but advocates relying more on {{the private sector and}} less on the publicly funded NASA to drive progress.|$|E
5|$|Charles William Beebe {{was born}} in Brooklyn, New York, son of the {{newspaper}} executive Charles Beebe. Although some sources have described him as an only child, he had a younger brother named John who died in infancy. Early in his life, {{his family moved to}} East Orange, New Jersey, where he began to acquire both his <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> natural world and his tendency to record everything he saw. The American Museum of Natural History, which opened the year that Beebe was born, fostered Beebe's love of nature and was an early influence on him.|$|E

His wife, Sarah Jane Paxton, worked public {{relations}} for 20th Century Fox at the same time. They told Brubaker stories about their experiences, and he developed a lifelong <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> time and setting. In particular, {{he was drawn to}} the false personas he felt everyone had to put forward to succeed.|$|E
5|$|French Sudan {{originally}} {{formed as}} a set of military outposts {{as an extension of the}} French colony in Senegal. Though the area offered France little economic or strategic gain, the military effectively advocated greater conquest in the region. This was partly due to a <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> great empires, such as the Mali Empire and the Songhay Empire that rose to prominence in the area, and partly due to the promotional opportunities that military conquest offered for French military personnel.|$|E
5|$|McKellen {{attended}} Bolton School (Boys' Division), {{of which}} he is still a supporter, attending regularly to talk to pupils. McKellen's acting career started at Bolton Little Theatre, {{of which he}} is now the patron. An early <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> theatre was encouraged by his parents, who took him on a family outing to Peter Pan at the Opera House in Manchester when he was three. When he was nine, his main Christmas present was a wood and bakelite, fold-away Victorian theatre from Pollocks Toy Theatres, with cardboard scenery and wires to push on the cut-outs of Cinderella and of Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.|$|E

5|$|Sestero recalls in {{his book}} The Disaster Artist that Wiseau {{intended}} for the film to contain a subplot in which Johnny was revealed to be a vampire, due to Wiseau's own <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> creatures. Sestero recounts how, {{at the outset of}} production, Wiseau tasked members of the crew with figuring out a way to execute a sequence in which Johnny's Mercedes-Benz would lift off from the roof of the townhouse and fly across the San Francisco skyline, revealing Johnny's vampiric nature. However, this scene did not end up being created for the film.|$|E
5|$|The {{uncritical}} {{acceptance of}} Price's reports prompted a formal {{study by the}} Society for Psychical Research (SPR), which rejected most of the sightings as either imagined or fabricated and cast doubt on Price's credibility. His claims are now generally discredited by ghost historians. Neither the SPR's report nor the more recent biography of Price has quelled public interest in these stories, and new books and television documentaries continue to satisfy public <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> rectory.|$|E
5|$|Ariel is the {{youngest}} of King Triton and Queen Athena's seven daughters. She is often seen {{in the company of}} Flounder, her best friend, and Sebastian, her father's advisor who is often assigned {{to keep an eye on}} her. In the television series and first film, Ariel has a <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> human world and often goes off to find human artifacts that she displays in a secret grotto. Ariel is often rebellious, wandering off on her own to explore her surroundings, and frequently disobeys the orders of her father or Sebastian, causing conflict between the characters. In The Little Mermaid, she is depicted as being willing to do anything to be with Prince Eric, even giving up her voice to become human. Clements described her as a typical teenager, prone to errors of judgment. She also is incredibly curious, and her curiosity often leads her into dangerous situations.|$|E

5|$|Botanical gardens {{have always}} {{responded to the}} {{interests}} {{and values of the}} day. If a single function were to be chosen from the early literature on botanical gardens, it would be their scientific endeavour and, flowing from this, their instructional value. In their formative years, botanical gardens were gardens for physicians and botanists, but then they progressively became more associated with ornamental horticulture and the needs of the general public. The scientific reputation of a botanical garden is now judged by the publications coming out of herbaria and similar facilities, not by its living collections. The interest in economic plants now has less relevance, and the concern with plant classification systems has all but disappeared, while a <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> curious, beautiful and new seems unlikely to diminish.|$|E
5|$|Dylan {{introduced}} a literary element to rock through his <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Surrealists and the French Symbolists, and his immersion in the New York City art {{scene of the}} early 1960s. The trend of bands with names drawn from literature, such as the Doors, Steppenwolf and the Ides of March, were a further sign of rock music aligning itself with high culture. Dylan also {{led the way in}} blending rock with folk music styles. This was followed by folk rock groups such as the Byrds, who based their initial sound on that of the Beatles. In turn, the Byrds' vocal harmonies inspired those of Yes, and British folk rock bands like Fairport Convention, who emphasised instrumental virtuosity. Some of these artists, such as the Incredible String Band and Shirley and Dolly Collins, would prove influential through their use of instruments borrowed from world music and early music.|$|E
5|$|Notable former {{students}} of the college have included politicians, scientists, writers, entertainers and academics. T. E. Lawrence ("Lawrence of Arabia"), known {{for his part in}} the Arab Revolt of 1916–1918 and for his writings including Seven Pillars of Wisdom, studied history at the college. His thesis on Crusader castles (the fieldwork for which marked the beginning of his <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Middle East) is held in the Fellows' Library. Other {{former students}} include Pixley ka Isaka Seme (a {{founder and president of the}} African National Congress), Sir William Williams (Speaker of the House of Commons 1680–1685), and Lord Sankey (Lord Chancellor 1929–1935). Members of Parliament from the three main political parties in the United Kingdom have attended the college, as have politicians from Australia (Neal Blewett), New Zealand (Harold Rushworth), Sri Lanka (Lalith Athulathmudali) and the United States (Heather Wilson).|$|E

5|$|The White Stripes used a low-fidelity {{approach}} to writing and recording. Their music featured a melding of garage rock and blues influences and a raw simplicity of composition, arrangement, and performance. The duo were also noted for their fashion and design aesthetic which featured a simple color scheme of red, white, and black—which was used on every album and single cover the band released—as {{well as the}} band's <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> number three. The band's discography consists of six studio albums, one live album, two extended plays (EP), one concert film, one tour documentary, 26 singles, and 14 music videos. Their last three albums each won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album.|$|E
5|$|The Story of Sigurd the Volsung and the Fall of the Niblungs (1876) is an epic poem of over 10,000 lines by William Morris {{that tells}} the tragic story, drawn from the Volsunga Saga and the Elder Edda, of the Norse hero Sigmund, his son Sigurd (the {{equivalent}} of Siegfried in the Nibelungenlied and Wagner's Ring of the Nibelung) and Sigurd's wife Gudrun. It sprang from a <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> Volsung legend that extended back twenty years to the author's youth, and had already resulted in several other literary and scholarly treatments of the story. It was Morris's own favorite of his poems, and was enthusiastically praised both by contemporary critics and by such figures as T. E. Lawrence and George Bernard Shaw. In recent years it has been rated very highly by many William Morris scholars, but has never succeeded in finding a wide readership on account of its great length and archaic diction. It {{has been seen as}} an influence on such fantasy writers as Andrew Lang and J. R. R. Tolkien. The Story of Sigurd is available in modern reprints, both in its original form and in a cut-down version, but there is no critical edition.|$|E
5|$|Unable to {{find work}} in Vancouver, Smith headed to Los Angeles in California, United States. On the way he stopped at San Francisco, where he met with Cecil Frederick Russell, a Thelemite who had {{departed}} from the Crowleyan orthodoxy to found his own group, the Choronzon Club. Smith however disliked Russell, and later claimed {{that he had been}} unnerved when Russell began expressing a sexual interest in children. After settling in Los Angeles, Smith gained a job at the Southern California Gas Company, entered into a relationship with a woman named Ann Barry, and began attending occasional meetings of the United Lodge of Theosophists, an esoteric organisation centred in the city. Jones meanwhile had united Thelema with auto-suggestion to found his own group, the Psychomagian Society (PMS), and he appointed Smith to be its Local Recorder for Los Angeles; out of friendship to Jones, Smith did so, but was uninterested in the PMS' teachings. Through their correspondences, Crowley came to reject the PMS and relations between himself and Jones once again broke down, this time permanently. Smith retained much affection for Jones, whom he saw as his mentor and friend, but nevertheless agreed with Crowley over the PMS and also rejected Jones' ongoing <b>fascination</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> UB, which Smith considered incompatible with Thelema; their relationship too came to an end in 1926.|$|E
