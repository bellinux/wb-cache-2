5|$|Heritable {{traits are}} passed from one {{generation}} to the next via DNA, a molecule that encodes genetic information. DNA is a long biopolymer composed of four types of bases. The sequence of bases along a particular DNA molecule specify the genetic information, in a manner similar to a sequence of letters spelling out a sentence. Before a cell divides, the DNA is copied, so that each of the resulting two cells will inherit the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> Portions of a DNA molecule that specify a single functional unit are called genes; different genes have different sequences of bases. Within cells, the long strands of DNA form condensed structures called chromosomes. The specific location of a <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> within a chromosome is known as a locus. If the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> at a locus varies between individuals, the different forms of this sequence are called alleles. DNA sequences can change through mutations, producing new alleles. If a mutation occurs within a gene, the new allele may affect the trait that the gene controls, altering the phenotype of the organism. However, while this simple correspondence between an allele and a trait works in some cases, most traits are more complex and are controlled by quantitative trait loci (multiple interacting genes).|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{design of}} <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> plays an {{important}} role in DNA computing. In this paper, we primarily focus on the combinatorial constraints of <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> in <b>DNA</b> encoding, and then analyze their relationships. We propose the evaluative formulas based on those constraints and transform <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> design into a multi-objective optimize problem. The artificial immune algorithm (AIA) /simulated annealing algorithm (SAA) is presented to solve the problem, and better <b>DNA</b> <b>sequences</b> than the previously known constructions are obtained...|$|R

5|$|All the {{functions}} of DNA depend on interactions with proteins. These protein interactions can be non-specific, or the protein can bind specifically to a single <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> Enzymes can also bind to DNA and of these, the polymerases that copy the DNA base sequence in transcription and DNA replication are particularly important.|$|E
5|$|Ashdown-Hill's {{research}} {{came about}} {{as a result of}} a challenge in 2003 to provide a <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> for Richard's sister Margaret, to identify bones found in her burial place, the Franciscan priory church in Mechelen, Belgium. He tried to extract a mitochondrial <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> from a preserved hair from Edward IV held by the Ashmolean Museum in Oxford but the attempt proved unsuccessful, owing to degradation of the DNA. Ashdown-Hill turned instead to genealogical research to identify an all-female-line descendant of Cecily Neville, Richard's mother. After two years he found a British-born woman who had emigrated to Canada after World War II, Joy Ibsen (n√©e Brown), was a direct descendant of Richard's sister, Anne of York (and therefore Richard's 16th-generation great-niece). Ibsen's mitochondrial DNA was tested and found to belong to mitochondrial DNA Haplogroup J, which by deduction should be Richard's mitochondrial DNA haplogroup. The mtDNA obtained from Ibsen showed that the Mechelen bones were not those of Margaret.|$|E

5|$|In 2002, Eckard Wimmer's {{group at}} SUNY Stony Brook succeeded in synthesizing {{poliovirus}} from its chemical code, producing the world's first synthetic virus. Scientists first converted poliovirus's published RNA sequence, 7741 bases long, into a <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence,</b> as DNA {{was easier to}} synthesize. Short fragments of this <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> were obtained by mail-order, and assembled. The complete viral genome was then assembled by a gene synthesis company. This whole painstaking process took two years. Nineteen markers were incorporated into the synthesized DNA, {{so that it could}} be distinguished from natural poliovirus. Enzymes were used to convert the DNA back into RNA, its natural state. Other enzymes were then used to translate the RNA into a polypeptide, producing functional viral particle. The newly minted synthetic virus was injected into PVR transgenic mice, to determine if the synthetic version was able to cause disease. The synthetic virus was able to replicate, infect, and cause paralysis or death in mice. However, the synthetic version was between 1/1,000th and 1/10,000th as lethal as the original virus.|$|E

5|$|Several phylogenetic studies {{published}} {{during the}} 1990s and 2000s supported {{a close relationship}} between Pseudoryzomys and two other oryzomyines with reduced or absent mesoloph(id)s, Lundomys and Holochilus. The extinct genera Noronhomys and Carletonomys, described in 1999 and 2008 respectively, were also recognized {{as members of the}} group. In 2006, a broad morphological and molecular phylogenetic study of Oryzomyini provided further support for the relationship between Holochilus, Lundomys, and Pseudoryzomys. Within this group, morphological data supported a closer relationship between Holochilus and Lundomys to the exclusion of Pseudoryzomys, but <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> data favored a clustering between Holochilus and Pseudoryzomys to the exclusion of Lundomys; among all oryzomyines, this was the only case where relationships which received strong support from morphological and <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> data conflicted. Together, the three genera form part of a large group of oryzomyines ("clade D"), which contains tens of other species. Several of those display some adaptations to life in the water, being partially aquatic, as do Pseudoryzomys and its relatives. Morphological data indicate that the genus Oryzomys is the closest relative of the group that includes Pseudoryzomys, but <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> data from the nuclear IRBP gene did not support this relationship; convergent adaptations towards a semiaquatic lifestyle may explain the morphological support for a relation between Oryzomys and the other three genera.|$|E

5|$|Bioinformatics {{involves}} {{the development of}} techniques to store, data mine, search and manipulate biological data, including DNA nucleic acid sequence data. These have led to widely applied advances in computer science, especially string searching algorithms, machine learning, and database theory. String searching or matching algorithms, which find an occurrence of a sequence of letters inside a larger sequence of letters, were developed to search for specific sequences of nucleotides. The <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> may be aligned with other DNA sequences to identify homologous sequences and locate the specific mutations that make them distinct. These techniques, especially multiple sequence alignment, are used in studying phylogenetic relationships and protein function. Data sets representing entire genomes' worth of DNA sequences, such as those produced by the Human Genome Project, are difficult to use without the annotations that identify the locations of genes and regulatory elements on each chromosome. Regions of <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence</b> that have the characteristic patterns associated with protein- or RNA-coding genes can be identified by gene finding algorithms, which allow researchers to predict the presence of particular gene products and their possible functions in an organism even before they have been isolated experimentally. Entire genomes may also be compared, which can {{shed light on the}} evolutionary history of particular organism and permit the examination of complex evolutionary events.|$|E
5|$|DNA can {{be damaged}} by many sorts of mutagens, which change the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence.</b> Mutagens include {{oxidizing}} agents, alkylating agents and also high-energy electromagnetic radiation such as ultraviolet light and X-rays. The type of DNA damage produced {{depends on the}} type of mutagen. For example, UV light can damage DNA by producing thymine dimers, which are cross-links between pyrimidine bases. On the other hand, oxidants such as free radicals or hydrogen peroxide produce multiple forms of damage, including base modifications, particularly of guanosine, and double-strand breaks. A typical human cell contains about 150,000 bases that have suffered oxidative damage. Of these oxidative lesions, the most dangerous are double-strand breaks, as these are difficult to repair and can produce point mutations, insertions, deletions from the <b>DNA</b> <b>sequence,</b> and chromosomal translocations. These mutations can cause cancer. Because of inherent limits in the DNA repair mechanisms, if humans lived long enough, they would all eventually develop cancer. DNA damages that are naturally occurring, due to normal cellular processes that produce reactive oxygen species, the hydrolytic activities of cellular water, etc., also occur frequently. Although most of these damages are repaired, in any cell some DNA damage may remain despite the action of repair processes. These remaining DNA damages accumulate with age in mammalian postmitotic tissues. This accumulation appears to be an important underlying cause of aging.|$|E
