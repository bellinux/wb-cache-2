Artani explained, [...] "He was getting personal. Here, she had a different type of image, and he was really exposing some stuff that she probably didn't want out there, and in front of her little sister... <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>her</b> sister being mortified and her being mortified. I'm sure that that really hurt her." [...] The song was also speculated to be a reply to Timberlake's [...] "Never Again", a ballad which appeared on his debut solo album Justified.

500|$|A {{significant}} [...] in {{the development}} of hip-hop was the addition of eight-counts, a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music. Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s. Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell, the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew. She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts. In an interview with NPR, Lockers member Adolfo [...] "Shabba-Doo" [...] Quiñones stated [...] "I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>her</b> teaching us how to count music. She was like, okay, we were like, count music? How do you count soul? It was crazy, you know?... all of our cues kind of went something like this, boom, pop, do boom, pada da boom, pada like that. And she was like, how do you guys get in sync like that? I said it's a feeling, you know?" [...] Traditionally hip-hop dance, or any form of street dance, is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting. So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip-hop dance from the street into the studio. Even with this addition, it would be years before commercial hip-hop developed into its current form.|$|E
2500|$|In 1928, Stevenson married Ellen Borden, a well-to-do socialite. The {{young couple}} soon became popular and {{familiar}} {{figures on the}} Chicago social scene; they especially enjoyed attending, and hosting, costume parties. They had three sons: Adlai Stevenson III, who would become a U.S. Senator; Borden Stevenson, and John Fell Stevenson. In 1935, Adlai and Ellen purchased a [...] tract of land along the Des Plaines River near Libertyville, Illinois, a wealthy suburb of Chicago. They built a home on the property and it served as Stevenson's official residence {{for the rest of}} his life. Although he spent relatively little time there due to his career, Stevenson did consider the farm to be his home, and in the 1950s, he was often called [...] "The Man from Libertyville" [...] by the national news media. Stevenson also purchased a farm in northwestern Illinois, just outside Galena, where he frequently rode horses and kept some cattle. In 1949, Adlai and Ellen were divorced; their son Adlai III later recalled that [...] "There hadn't been a good relationship for a long time. <b>I</b> <b>remember</b> <b>her</b> [...] as the unreasonable one, not only with Dad, but with us and the servants. I was embarrassed by her peremptory way with servants." [...] Several of Stevenson's biographers have written that his wife suffered from mental illness: [...] "Incidents that went from petulant to bizarre to nasty generally have been described without placing them in the context of the progression of (her) increasingly serious mental illness. It was an illness that those closest to her - including Adlai for long after the divorce - were slow and reluctant to recognize. Hindsight, legal proceedings, and psychiatric testimony now make understandable the behavior that baffled and saddened her family." [...] Stevenson did not remarry after his divorce, but instead dated a number of prominent women throughout the rest of his life, including Alicia Patterson, Marietta Tree, and Betty Beale.|$|E
