5|$|Following the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> {{handover}} ceremony, {{when the}} Union Jack and the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> blue ensign were lowered to symbolise {{the end of}} British rule in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong,</b> the blue ensign lost its official status {{and was replaced by}} the current flag of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong.</b> In the 2010s, the former flag of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> was used by protesters to represent the cultural differences between <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> and China; the flag was also used to protest Chinese interference in <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong,</b> as well as perceived Chinese breaches of Hong Kong's universal suffrage (granted by the Sino-British Joint Declaration). The first high-profile use of the old flag in protests came in 2011 during pro-democracy protests. Protesters often stated that they did not use the blue ensign to endorse <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> independence or the return of <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> to British control, but rather because they felt that <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> had greater freedom under British rule. The protesters also said that they used the flag to express the contrasting values of China and <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong.</b> Advocates of the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Independence Movement and the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Autonomy Movement use a derivative of the blue ensign, without the Union Jack and with the Chinese characters for <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> (香港) in the centre of the arms. The right to display the old flag is protected under the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Bill of Rights Ordinance and the <b>Hong</b> <b>Kong</b> Basic Law as an expression of free speech. Despite this, when the old flag began appearing in protests, pro-Beijing newspapers called for it to be banned. The pro-Beijing camp views the flag as a symbol of colonialism and a reminder of China's losses during the era of New Imperialism.|$|E
