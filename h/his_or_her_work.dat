25|$|The Privacy Rule gives {{individuals}} {{the right}} to request that a covered entity correct any inaccurate PHI. It also requires covered entities to take reasonable steps to ensure the confidentiality of communications with individuals. For example, an individual can ask to be called at <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> number instead of home or cell phone numbers.|$|E
25|$|Another {{version of}} {{formalism}} is often known as deductivism. In deductivism, the Pythagorean theorem {{is not an}} absolute truth, but a relative one: if one assigns meaning to the strings {{in such a way}} that the rules of the game become true (i.e., true statements are assigned to the axioms and the rules of inference are truth-preserving), then one must accept the theorem, or, rather, the interpretation one has given it must be a true statement. The same is held to be true for all other mathematical statements. Thus, formalism need not mean that mathematics is nothing more than a meaningless symbolic game. It is usually hoped that there exists some interpretation in which the rules of the game hold. (Compare this position to structuralism.) But it does allow the working mathematician to continue in <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> and leave such problems to the philosopher or scientist. Many formalists would say that in practice, the axiom systems to be studied will be suggested by the demands of science or other areas of mathematics.|$|E

5000|$|The gallery's inaugural exhibition, Linocuts of the 1930s, which {{featured}} {{the works of}} Lev Lapin (1889-1962) began the museum's tradition of exhibiting previously unknown artworks of the 1920s and 1930s. Some of these exhibitions are of work by artists who are not well known, while others are lesser-known works of the more famous artists of that era. Each exhibition is dedicated to one artist, and features only <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R
5000|$|A pen name (nom de plume, or {{literary}} double) is {{a pseudonym}} (or, in some cases, a variant {{form of a}} real name) adopted by an author and printed on the title page <b>or</b> by-line of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> in place of their [...] "real" [...] name. A pen name {{may be used to}} make the author's name more distinctive, to disguise <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> gender, to distance an author from some <b>or</b> all of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> previous <b>works,</b> to protect the author from retribution for <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> writings, to combine more than one author into a single author, or for any of a number of reasons related to the marketing or aesthetic presentation of the work. The author's name may be known only to the publisher, or may come to be common knowledge.|$|R
500|$|The {{character}} {{became known}} for her [...] manipulative behavior and was often labeled a [...] "soap vixen". She was praised by television critics, with Carolyn McGuire of The Chicago Tribune saying: [...] "Whoever shows up as the next villain, chances are <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> won't be easy. That's because at least one resident—Abby Ewing—knows how to dish nasty {{with the best of}} them." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap opera Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] John Mapes of The Biography Channel said, [...] "Any great soap opera needs a great villain. While viewers may identify more with the protagonist, the villains in a serial drama always spice things up, cause trouble, and make it more fun to watch." ...|$|E
500|$|Abby {{was well}} {{received}} by television critics.

Only Alexis Carrington Colby Dexter, played by Joan Collins on Dynasty, and Angela Channing, portrayed by Jane Wyman on [...] Falcon Crest, rival Abby Ewing, played by Donna Mills, for best prime-time female villain." [...] When asked which character he wished he had created, Mike Kelly, the creator of ABC's popular primetime-soap Revenge, said: [...] "Abby Ewing. Donna Mills, you rocked my world." [...] Jamey Giddens of Zap2it said, [...] "While I readily admit Alexis will go down in soap history as the most famous of the 80's primetime soap vixens, she was never truly my cup of detergent. I much preferred the more subdued, methodical villainy of characters like Abby Fairgate (Donna Mills), who slept her way through Seaview Circle, and to the top of Corporate California on Knots Landing. God I miss that damn Cul-de-Sac!" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{organization}} {{of work in}} Brook Farm changed over time because of both financial troubles and changes in ideologies. Members of Brook Farm initially participated in an “attractive industry” system where each individual could pick <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> assignments based on their won preferences. [...] This method {{did not have any}} specific authority making sure that essential tasks were getting done. After initial leniency, some sensed that not all members were doing their fair share of the labor, so in 1841 the community adopted required standards for work: ten hours of work were required per day during the summer, and eight hours during winter. When Brook Farm first started adopting Fourierist notions, they created a more structured work environment with a system that consisted of three series of industry, which were [...] agriculture, mechanical, and domestic, and within each series {{there were a number of}} groups that handled more specific tasks. [...] Each group had a chief whose duty it was to keep a record of the work done. While this system did create a new work hierarchy, the members still had the flexibility to move between groups easily. These new measures caused Brook Farm to achieve a profit in 1844 which was a feat that had not been accomplished in its first few years of the community's existence.|$|E

50|$|At {{the end of}} the 1990s, {{some small}} {{companies}} began selling copies of movies, without the violent, indecent or foul language parts, to appeal to the family audience. By 2003, Hollywood reacted against these unauthorized modifications, as it considered them to be a destruction of the filmmakers work, and a violation of the controls an author has over <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>works.</b> Famous directors and producers, such as Steven Spielberg, have publicly criticised this practice in magazines.|$|R
500|$|Many reviewers {{and writers}} were {{critical}} of {{the manner in which}} Patrick Hemingway edited the work. Paul Gray [...] titled his review of the book [...] "Where's Papa?", answering with the opening sentence, [...] "He's hard to find in his fifth posthumous work", pointing directly to Patrick Hemingway's editing of the manuscript. Lynn thinks Hemingway would have been [...] "outraged by his sons' refusal to honor his judgment that the manuscript was unworthy of publication" [...] and was outraged that [...] "Patrick Hemingway declares that his two brothers, Jack and Gregory, share his belief that 'this job was worth doing'". [...] Burwell also wonders [...] whether Hemingway wanted the Africa book published, pointing to [...] his statement, [...] "I think maybe {{it would be better to}} wait until I'm dead to publish it", although she concedes that works by Chaucer, Shakespeare, and Kafka were unfinished and published posthumously. During the final two decades of his life, Hemingway had published two novels but since his death, works continue to be published. Writing in The New Yorker in 1998, Joan Didion was extremely {{critical of the}} Hemingway family and estate for [...] commercializing and profiting from his reputation and writing rather than protecting his legacy. [...] "The publication of unfinished work is a denial of the idea that the role of the writer in <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>work</b> is to make it", she wrote, adding that True at First Light should not have been [...] "molded" [...] and published.|$|E

5000|$|Klagge and Nordmann note a {{conflict}} that faces an editor choosing what to publish draft material from a Nachlass: to understand a scholar (in this case Wittgenstein) [...] "as {{he would want to}} be understood, we should focus on the works that came closest to passing muster with him." [...] Yet publication of draft material may perhaps assist in {{a deeper understanding of the}} published versions, and also help understand the process whereby the scholar created <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>works.</b>|$|R

The selection of an author generally corresponds to a major new addition to the corpus of <b>his</b> <b>or</b> <b>her</b> <b>works</b> in the Bibliothèque, which is a French-language collection of classic French and international texts. The book is richly illustrated and focusses on iconography. An accompanying bibliographical text is prepared by a renowned specialist of the selected author.|$|R
