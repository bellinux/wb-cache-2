5|$|Such {{trafficking}} capacity {{depends on}} the MAM, which {{has been shown to}} facilitate transfer of lipid intermediates between organelles. In contrast to the standard vesicular mechanism of lipid transfer, evidence indicates that the physical proximity of the ER and mitochondrial membranes at the MAM allows for lipid <b>flipping</b> between opposed bilayers. Despite this unusual and seemingly energetically unfavorable mechanism, such transport does not require ATP. Instead, in yeast, it {{has been shown to be}} dependent on a multiprotein tethering structure termed the ER-mitochondria encounter structure, or ERMES, although it remains unclear whether this structure directly mediates lipid transfer or is required to keep the membranes in sufficiently close proximity to lower the energy barrier for lipid <b>flipping.</b>|$|E

40|$|Human {{ovarian cancer}} is the most lethal {{gynecological}} malignancy. Although cisplatin (CDDP) and paclitaxel are the first-line chemotherapeutic agents for ovarian cancer, chemoresistance is a major therapeutic problem with mechanisms involved still not well understood. Dysregulation of the apoptotic cascade may be a causative factor for chemoresistance. Indeed gene products involved in the regulation of apoptosis, including the PI 3 K/Akt and Flice-Like Inhibitory Protein (<b>FLIP)</b> are frequently over-expressed and/or dysregulated in chemoresistant cells. <b>FLIP,</b> a caspase- 8 analogue, modulates death receptor-mediated apoptosis by preventing caspase- 8 activation. Since <b>FLIP</b> may have a critical involvement in ovarian cancer chemoresistance, it is importance to understand its role, the molecular and cellular mechanisms by which <b>FLIP</b> is regulated, and if and how dysregulated <b>FLIP</b> degradation {{is involved in the}} etiology of chemoresistance. Human ovarian cancer cell lines were used to establish the possible involvement of <b>FLIP</b> in the regulation of CDDP sensitivity in vitro and to assess the mechanism by which CDDP regulates <b>FLIP.</b> We demonstrated that CDDP down-regulates <b>FLIP</b> content, induces caspase- 8 and - 3 activation and apoptosis in chemosensitive ovarian cancer cells, but not in their resistant counterparts. Moreover, we observed that <b>FLIP</b> over-expression in chemosensitive cells attenuates CDDP sensitivity, while <b>FLIP</b> down-regulation sensitizes chemoresistant cells to CDDP. We further demonstrated that CDDP had no effects on <b>FLIP</b> mRNA abundance but down-regulated <b>FLIP</b> protein content in chemosensitive cells, a response attenuated by proteasome inhibitors. Itch is an E 3 ligase protein involved in protein ubiquitination. CDDP also enhances FLIP-p 53 -Itch cell membrane co-localization, and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination in chemosensitive but not resistance cells. In addition, Itch silencing attenuates CDDP-induced <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination. p 53 siRNA also attenuates FLIP-Itch and FLIP-p 53 interactions and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination. While Akt activation inhibits CDDP-induced <b>FLIP</b> degradation and apoptosis in chemosensitive cells, these responses are facilitated by dominant-negative Akt expression in their resistant variants. Finally, p 53 siRNA attenuates CDDP-induced and dominant negative (DN) -Akt-facilitated FLIP-p 53 binding and <b>FLIP</b> ubiquitination in resistant cells. These studies improve our understanding of <b>FLIP</b> involvement in chemoresistance, the mechanism by which CDDP regulates <b>FLIP,</b> and dysregulation of <b>FLIP</b> degradation in chemoresistance in ovarian cancer...|$|R
5|$|Coming into series six as reigning champion, Razer {{started its}} title defence by {{qualifying}} from a four-way melee.

Razer next fought Dantomkia, which was armed with a pneumatic <b>flipping</b> arm. Although Razer was the early aggressor, Dantomkia retaliated by pushing Razer into the arena wall.

5|$|Despite {{receiving}} financing {{from other}} sources, including Saul Zaentz (who agreed {{to distribute the}} soundtrack album on his Fantasy Records label), the budget was tight enough to exclude pencil tests, so Bakshi had to test the animation by <b>flipping</b> an animator's drawings in his hand before they were inked and painted. When a cameraman realized that the cels for the desert scenes were not wide enough and revealed the transparency, Bakshi painted a cactus to cover the mistake. Very few storyboards were used. Bakshi and Vita walked around the Lower East Side, Washington Square Park, Chinatown and Harlem, taking moody snapshots. Artist Ira Turek inked the outlines of these photographs onto cels with a Rapidograph, the technical pen preferred by Crumb, giving the film's backgrounds a stylized realism virtually unprecedented in animation. The tones of the watercolor backgrounds were influenced {{by the work of}} Ashcan School painters such as George Luks and John French Sloan. Among other unusual techniques, bent and fisheye camera perspectives were used to portray the way the film's hippies and hoodlums viewed the city. Many scenes featured documentary recordings of real conversations in place of scripted dialogue—this too would become a signature of Bakshi's.|$|E

5|$|Investigators {{found that}} as the jet was {{beginning}} its takeoff rotation, engine number one separated from the left wing, <b>flipping</b> {{over the top of}} the wing and landing on the runway. As the engine separated from the aircraft, it severed hydraulic lines that locked the wing's leading edge slats in place and damaged a three-foot section of the left wing's leading edge. Aerodynamic forces acting on the wing resulted in an uncommanded retraction of the outboard slats. As the jet began to climb, the damaged left wing, with no engine, produced far less lift (stalled) than the right wing, with its slats still deployed and its engine running at full takeoff speed. The disrupted and unbalanced aerodynamics of the aircraft caused it to roll abruptly to the left until it was partially inverted, reaching a bank angle of 112 degrees, before crashing in an open field by a trailer park near the end of the runway. The engine separation was attributed to damage to the pylon structure holding the engine to the wing, caused by improper maintenance procedures used at American Airlines.|$|E
5|$|Seventy {{minutes of}} footage, mostly {{dealing with the}} origin, were not {{included}} in the final cut.

Leterrier explained a negative test screening, where flashbacks were placed across the film that the audience found too similar to Hulk, had resulted in compressing these to the film's start. This replaced the original opening, where Banner comes to the Arctic to commit suicide. When the scene ends, in an instant the frozen body of Captain America is partially seen in the ice.
