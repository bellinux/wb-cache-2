Firstly, the Histogram difference of every frame is calculated, and then {{the edges of the}} candidate key frames are extracted by Prewitt operator. At last, the paper makes the edges of adjacent frames match. If the <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> rate is up to 50 %, the current frame is deemed to the redundant key frame and should be discarded.

30|$|Considering the {{above-mentioned}} problems, we extract moving edges from current image while removing the background edges by comparing with spatiotemporal edge information of three successive frames. We represent edges as segments, {{where all the}} edge pixels belonging to a segment are considered as a unit and processed together. A distance transformation-based flexible <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> is proposed which is more robust than pixel-based matching. Segment-based representation of edges and flexible <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> make the system efficient in terms of accuracy and time, and reduce the occurrence of scattered moving edges significantly. The proposed method is adaptive to the illumination variation as it uses most recent frames. A watershed-based algorithm is utilized which makes use of the extracted moving edges to segment moving object region with more accurate boundary. It ensures meaningful representation of moving objects, which is essential in video surveillance and many other image content-based applications in multimedia communication.|$|E

30|$|This paper {{presents}} a moving-object segmentation algorithm using edge information as segment. The proposed method is developed to address challenges due to variations in ambient lighting and background contents. We investigated {{the suitability of}} the proposed algorithm {{in comparison with the}} traditional-intensity-based as well as edge-pixel-based detection methods. In our method, edges are extracted from video frames and are represented as segments using an efficiently designed edge class. This representation helps to obtain the geometric information of edge in the case of <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> and moving-object segmentation; and facilitates incorporating knowledge into edge segment during background modeling and motion tracking. An efficient approach for background initialization and robust method of <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> is presented, to effectively reduce the risk of false alarm due to illumination change and camera motion while maintaining the high sensitivity to the presence of moving object. Detected moving edges are utilized along with watershed algorithm for extracting video object plane (VOP) with more accurate boundary. Experiment results with real image sequence reflect that the proposed method is suitable for automated video surveillance applications in various monitoring systems.|$|E
40|$|A {{well-known}} {{combinatorial optimization}} {{problem is the}} graph partitioning problem. Since solving it optimally requires very much time, we {{have to settle for}} approximated methods. One such method is the multilevel k-way partitioning scheme. The overall idea is the following: The size of the graph is reduced during a process known as coarsening, where smaller and smaller graphs are made. Then a k-way partition is found from the much smaller graph and the graph and the partition is projected back to the original size. In this master thesis, we study a central part of the multilevel k-way partitioning scheme, coarsening. In order make smaller and smaller graphs we use a technique known as matching. We introduce a new matching heuristic, global greedy heavy <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> and perform a large number of experiments comparing it to other matching heuristics. Our results include the discovery of two new partition vectors for the graph partitioning archive([URL] and that using global greedy heavy <b>edge</b> <b>matching</b> generally produces better results than already existing matching heuristics...|$|E
