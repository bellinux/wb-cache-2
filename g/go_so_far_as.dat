5|$|According to the synoptics, {{the arrest}} of Jesus was a {{reaction}} to the cleansing of the temple, while according to John it was triggered by the raising of Lazarus. The Pharisees, portrayed as more uniformly legalistic and opposed to Jesus in the synoptic gospels, are instead portrayed as sharply divided; they debate frequently in John's accounts. Some, such as Nicodemus, even <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to be at least partially sympathetic to Jesus. This is believed to be a more accurate historical depiction of the Pharisees, who made debate one of the tenets of their system of belief.|$|E
5|$|The Cow Tower was {{deliberately}} designed to house gunpowder artillery {{when it was}} first built, making it a very rare form of defensive structure for its time: the only equivalents in England are God's House Tower in Southampton, and the West Gate at Canterbury. The archaeologists Oliver Creighton and Robert Higham <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to consider the building to be unique within Britain, as God's House was an extension of an existing building, and the West Gate part of the city's walled circuit. The concept of an isolated artillery tower was more common in France, where they were used as temporary and permanent defensive features during the Hundred Years War between the English and the French kings.|$|E
5|$|Grand Theft Auto clones allow {{players to}} freely explore the game world, which is {{typically}} {{on the scale}} of an entire city. Some games base their level design on real world cities, such as London, New York City, and Los Angeles. Players are usually able to navigate by vehicle or on foot. Some games put greater emphasis on leaping, climbing, and even swimming. Exploring the world is not just necessary to complete objectives, but also to gain valuable items, weapons, and vehicles. Different parts of the game world may be controlled by different enemy factions, who will attempt to stop the player in a variety of ways. However, more recent games in this genre allow players to acquire their own territory. The freedom of navigating a huge game world may be overwhelming or confusing for new players. Game designers {{have come up with a}} variety of navigational aids to solve this problem. A mini-map feature is common, while Saints Row and Grand Theft Auto IV <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to offer a GPS service. Games without these navigation tools are sometimes criticized as confusing.|$|E

25|$|It is {{generally}} only highly skilled workers that can enjoy such benefits as written in their contracts, although many professional fields would not <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to discourage workaholic behaviour. Unskilled workers will almost {{always have to}} rely on bare minimum legal requirements. The legal requirements are low in many countries, in particular, the United States. In contrast, the European Union has gone quite far in assuring a legal work–life balance framework, for example pertaining to parental leave and the non-discrimination of part-time workers.|$|E
25|$|However, the aye-aye {{is often}} viewed as a harbinger of evil and killed on sight. Others believe, if one points its narrowest finger at someone, they are marked for death.

But it would be possible to take means like harmony, modulation, rhythm, instrumentation and others to let a musical motif endure a fate. In any case, a programme should be added to a piece of music only if it was necessarily needed for an adequate understanding of that piece.|$|E
25|$|In some sectors brewers are {{reluctant}} to embrace new technology for fear of losing the traditional characteristics of their beer. For example, Marston's Brewery in Burton on Trent still uses open wooden Burton Union sets for fermentation {{in order to maintain}} the quality and flavour of its beers, while Belgium's lambic brewers <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to expose their brews to outside air in order to pick up the natural wild yeasts which ferment the wort. Traditional brewing techniques protect the beer from oxidation by maintaining a carbon dioxide blanket over the wort as it ferments into beer.|$|E

He would <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to carry a copy of Variety or an appropriate piece of company stationery in order to look inconspicuous while sneaking backstage or into a TV studio. Cavett took many odd jobs ranging from store detective to label typist for a Wall Street firm, and as a copyboy at Time Magazine.|$|E
25|$|It is {{considered}} to be an outstanding edible species with a distinctively sweet or nutty flavor. However, great caution must be exercised to properly identify it, as the deadly Amanita ocreata (and occasionally Amanita phalloides) is also found in the same habitat at the same time of year, and can often be found in close proximity to each other. A. ocreata and A. phalloides have thin universal veil remnants, a sac-like volva, an annulus, a non-striate pileus margin, and a pileus that is a different color than A. velosa. These differences can fade as the fruiting body ages, making it important to collect only specimens that have all of their identifying characteristics intact. Some authorities <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to say no Amanita should be considered for eating.|$|E
25|$|Traditionalist Catholics {{other than}} sedevacantists {{recognize}} as legitimate {{the line of}} Popes leading to and including Pope Francis. Some of them hold that {{one or more of}} the most recent popes have held and taught unorthodox beliefs, but do not <b>go</b> <b>so</b> <b>far</b> <b>as</b> to say that they have been formal heretics or have been widely and publicly judged to be heretics. Sedevacantists, on the other hand, claim that the infallible Magisterium of the Catholic Church could not have decreed the changes made in the name of the Second Vatican Council, and conclude that those who issued these changes could not have been acting with the authority of the Catholic Church. Accordingly, they hold that Pope Paul VI and his successors left the true Catholic Church and thus lost legitimate authority in the Church. A formal heretic, they say, cannot be the Catholic pope.|$|E
