5|$|Although {{they were}} not penalized, Nuggets coach George Karl and Knicks coach <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> were both {{scrutinized}} for their part in the brawl. Carmelo Anthony was also criticized for harming his image as a star, and several writers said the league had penalized the players excessively because it wanted to keep its image free from violence.|$|E
5|$|As General Manager, <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> quickly staffed the {{management}} positions {{with his own}} personnel, naming long-time Detroit Pistons assistant Brendan Malone as the Raptors' head coach. The team's roster was then filled {{as a result of}} an expansion draft in 1995. Following a coin flip, Toronto was given first choice and selected Chicago Bulls point guard and three-point specialist B. J. Armstrong. Armstrong refused to report for training, and Thomas promptly traded him to the Golden State Warriors for power forwards Carlos Rogers and Victor Alexander. Thomas then selected a wide range of players in the expansion draft, including veterans Jerome Kersey, Willie Anderson and his former Pistons teammate John Salley.|$|E
50|$|<b>Isiah</b> Lord <b>Thomas</b> III (born April 30, 1961) is an American retired {{basketball}} player who played professionally for the Detroit Pistons in the National Basketball Association (NBA). A point guard, the 12-time NBA All-Star was {{named one of}} the 50 Greatest Players in NBA History and inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

2500|$|<b>Isiah</b> Lord <b>Thomas</b> III {{was the son}} of Isiah II and Mary Thomas and the {{youngest}} of seven boys and two girls of the couple. Isiah's father was an army veteran wounded in the Battle of Saipan. He later attended trade school, eventually becoming the first black supervisor at International Harvester in Chicago. When the plant closed, the only work he could find was as a janitor and the family fell into hardship and Isiah II left when Isiah was a young child. Thomas grew up in the heart of Chicago's West Side ghetto. After their parents' separation, he lived with his mother Mary. Born a Baptist, Mary turned the family toward Catholicism.|$|R
5|$|Before high school, Turner {{and fellow}} NBA player Iman Shumpert were {{teammates}} on the 8th grade basketball team at Gwendolyn Brooks Middle School in Oak Park, Illinois. He {{played in the}} Summer 2004 AAU Boys 15-under Basketball National Championship Tournament for the Illinois Knights. As a high school sophomore, he helped lead St. Joseph to a run in the Illinois AA Boys High School basketball tournament, which helped him {{get the attention of}} NCAA Division I basketball coaches. At St. Joseph's, which had once produced <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas,</b> he was part of a Chicago area sophomore class (which included Derrick Rose, and his St. Joseph's teammate Demetri McCamey).|$|E
5|$|In 2011, center Dakari Johnson {{was named}} National Freshman of the Year by ESPN HS. In the {{following}} months, Okafor beat out Johnson {{for a spot}} on the 2011 FIBA Americas Under-16 Championship Team USA. Okafor spent his sophomore season ranked as the number one center and second best player in the national class of 2014 by SLAM Magazine behind Andrew Wiggins, according to SLAM's Franklyn Calle. In January 2012 during his sophomore season, he was ranked third in the class by ESPNU. By April, he was ranked second. By the end of his second year, there was talk that with Jabari Parker Chicago might produce the number one high school player in the country in back to back years, something that they had come close to with Mark Aguirre and <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> in the late 1970s. Also in the 1981 NBA draft Aguirre and Thomas were selected first and second, respectively. On October 25, 2012, Andrew Wiggins reclassified into the class of 2013, which cleared the way for Okafor to assume the number one ranking in the Rivals.com ranking for the class of 2014. As of November 2012, he was listed number one in the national class of 2014 by Rivals.com and number two by ESPN. He remained number one according to Rivals with its March 14, 2013 rankings update, following his junior season.|$|E

40|$|PURPOSE: The typical toxidrome in {{organophosphate}} (OP) poisoning comprises of the Salivation, Lacrimation, Urination, Defecation, Gastric cramps, Emesis (SLUDGE) symptoms. However, {{several other}} manifestations are described. We review {{the spectrum of}} symptoms and signs in OP poisoning {{as well as the}} different approaches to clinical features in these patients. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Articles were obtained by electronic search of PubMed(®) between 1966 and April 2014 using the search terms organophosphorus compounds or phosphoric acid esters AND poison or poisoning AND manifestations. RESULTS: Of the 5026 articles on OP poisoning, 2584 articles pertained to human poisoning; 452 articles focusing on clinical manifestations in human OP poisoning were retrieved for detailed evaluation. In addition to the traditional approach of symptoms and signs of OP poisoning as peripheral (muscarinic, nicotinic) and central nervous system receptor stimulation, symptoms were alternatively approached using a time-based classification. In this, symptom onset was categorized as acute (within 24 -h), delayed (24 -h to 2 -week) or late (beyond 2 -week). Although most symptoms occur with minutes or hours following acute exposure, delayed onset symptoms occurring after a period of minimal or mild symptoms, may impact treatment and timing of the discharge following acute exposure. Symptoms and signs were also viewed as an organ specific as cardiovascular, respiratory or neurological manifestations. An organ specific approach enables focused management of individual organ dysfunction that may vary with different OP compounds. CONCLUSIONS: Different approaches to the symptoms and signs in OP poisoning may better our understanding of the underlying mechanism that in turn may assist with the management of acutely poisoned patients.

25|$|In Game 5 of the 1987 Eastern Conference Finals {{against the}} Detroit Pistons, with five seconds {{remaining}} {{in the fourth quarter}} and Boston trailing the Pistons 107–106, Bird stole an inbound pass from <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> that was intended for Bill Laimbeer. Falling out of bounds, Bird turned and passed the ball to teammate Dennis Johnson, who was cutting to the basket and converted a 2-point layup with less than a second left. The Pistons called a timeout but had no chance of getting off a shot. The dramatic play saved the series for the Celtics who won in 7 games, and they advanced to the Finals.|$|E

25|$|Layden's {{last season}} as the GM for the Knicks started off with the {{selections}} of Mike Sweetney from Georgetown with the 9th-pick in the draft, Maciej Lampe of Poland with the 30th-pick, and Slavko Vraneš of Serbia and Montenegro with the 39th-pick. Sweetney was later traded by Layden's successor <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> {{as part of the}} deal with the Chicago Bulls that saw the Knicks acquire center Eddy Curry. Lampe never played in a game for New York as he was later traded to the Phoenix Suns, also by Thomas {{as part of the deal}} that saw Stephon Marbury come to the Knicks. Vraneš also never saw NBA action with New York, he was waived by the team after being tendered a 1-year minimum contract; currently his career spans one game with the Portland Trail Blazers.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} game of the 2010–11 season, Rondo put up 17 assists, which tied with Oscar Robertson for the third-most assists in a season opener. In the third game of the season, he dished out a career-high 24 assists along with a triple-double (10 points and 10 rebounds) against the New York Knicks. It tied him with <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> as the only players in NBA history to have at least 24 assists in a triple-double. His total of 50 assists through the first three games of the season tied John Stockton's NBA record for most assists in the first 3 games of the season. In the next game against the Detroit Pistons, he {{finished}} the game with 17 assists for a total of 67 assists, which is the most assists in the team's first four games in NBA history. With a 15 assists effort the following day, Rondo again set a record for most assists through the first five games.|$|E
25|$|The 1979–80 Hoosiers, led by Mike Woodson and <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas,</b> won the Big Ten {{championship}} and {{advanced to the}} 1980 Sweet Sixteen. The following season, in 1980–81, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, Knight's second national title. In 1982–1983, with the strong play of Uwe Blab and All-Americans Ted Kitchel and Randy Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship. However, with an injury to All-American Ted Kitchel mid-season, the Hoosiers' prospects were grim. Knight asked for fan support to rally around the team and, when the team ultimately won the Big Ten title, he ordered that a banner be hung for the team in Assembly Hall {{as a tribute to}} the fans, who he credited with inspiring the team to win its final three home games. Nevertheless, in the tournament Kitchel's absence was felt and the team lost to Kentucky in the 1983 Sweet Sixteen.|$|E
25|$|As he {{had done}} in 1989–90, Malone {{finished}} the 1991–92 season second {{in the league in}} scoring, averaging 28.0 points per game. He made the All-NBA First Team for the fourth straight year. It was also a breakout season for the Jazz; during the 1992 NBA Playoffs, the team made the Western Conference Finals {{for the first time in}} franchise history. Malone scored 40 or more points in five games this season. Despite his continued success and achievements, Malone encountered trouble for committing a flagrant foul. On December 14, 1991, when the Jazz played against the Detroit Pistons, Malone elbowed the Pistons' <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> on the head. Thomas needed 40 stitches on his eye, and the NBA suspended Malone for the next game without pay and fined him $10,000. In its first-ever franchise Western Conference Finals appearance, in six games the Jazz left the playoffs for the second straight season to the Portland Trail Blazers. Malone averaged 29.1 points on 52.1% shooting and 11.9 rebounds in the 1992 playoffs.|$|E
25|$|Behind {{the play}} of Mike Woodson Indiana won the 1979 NIT {{championship}}.

The following season, in 1980–81, Thomas and the Hoosiers once again won a conference title and won the 1981 NCAA tournament, the school's fourth national title. In 1982–1983, with the strong play of Uwe Blab and All-Americans Ted Kitchel and Randy Wittman, the No. 1 ranked Hoosiers were favorites to win another national championship.

25|$|In January 2000, the Mansfield Hawks of the International Basketball Association, {{moved to}} Saskatoon mid-way through the 1999–2000 season {{to become the}} Saskatchewan Hawks. The IBA was a league that was based mainly in the Midwestern United States, with the lone Canadian team prior to Saskatchewan's entry, being the Winnipeg Cyclone. The Hawks {{finished}} the 1999–2000 season at what {{is now known as}} the Credit Union Centre and played the 2000–01 season in the IBA as well. During the 2000–01 season, a rival league called the Continental Basketball Association folded due to what is thought of as mismanagement by the league owner <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas.</b> During the summer of 2001, a group of former CBA owners purchased the assets of the league. In order to field teams for the 2001–02 season, the CBA ownership convinced the Hawks' IBA and another league, the International Basketball League to merge and many of its member clubs became CBA teams. The Hawks were one of these clubs to join the CBA. The Hawks' poor performance on the court, coupled with poor attendance figures, saw the team quietly fold during the summer of 2002.|$|E
25|$|The 2000–2001 season {{brought to}} an end to Bob Costas' direct role with the NBA on NBC (although Costas would work playoff games {{for the next two}} seasons and would return to host NBC's {{coverage}} for the 2002 NBA Finals). Costas deferred to Marv Albert, allowing Albert to again be the lead broadcaster for the NBA, and stayed on only to deliver interviews and special features. On the studio front, Hannah Storm left her position as studio host to go on maternity leave, with Ahmad Rashād taking over for Storm; <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> left NBC to become coach of the Indiana Pacers. Joining Ahmad Rashād were former Phoenix Suns player Kevin Johnson and former NBA coach P. J. Carlesimo. Marv Albert joined Doug Collins as the primary broadcast team, and the two broadcast the 2001 NBA Finals, which had the highest ratings for a Finals match since 1998. After the season, Collins was hired away from NBC by the Washington Wizards, which forced the network to move the longtime secondary color duo of Steve Jones and Bill Walton to the lead broadcast team with Albert.|$|E
25|$|The offseason brought {{sweeping}} {{changes to the}} Pacers' lineup, as Rik Smits and coach Larry Bird retired, Chris Mullin returned to his old Golden State Warriors team, Mark Jackson signed a long-term contract with Toronto, and Dale Davis was traded to Portland for Jermaine O'Neal, {{who went on to}} average 12.9 points per game in his first year as a starter. It was a rebuilding year for the Pacers under new head coach <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas,</b> but the team still managed to return to the playoffs, where they lost to the top-seeded Philadelphia 76ers in four games. In the midseason of 2001–02, the Pacers made a blockbuster trade with the Chicago Bulls that sent Jalen Rose and Travis Best to Chicago in exchange for Brad Miller, Ron Artest, Kevin Ollie and Ron Mercer. Miller and Artest would, in the next few years, go on to be All-Stars for the Pacers. The trade bolstered a team that had been floundering, and the Pacers managed to return to the playoffs, where they pushed the top-seeded New Jersey Nets to five games before losing Game 5 in double overtime. Jermaine O'Neal made his first of what would be several All-Star appearances in his Pacers career.|$|E
25|$|Hoping to find {{a leader}} that could put the team back on track, New York hired Larry Brown to coach the team. Brown, who idolized the team during his childhood, was well {{regarded}} for his coaching abilities and his arrival brought a sense of hope to the franchise. Hoping to find the next Patrick Ewing, the Knicks drafted center Channing Frye and signed centers Jerome James and Eddy Curry, the former prior to the season and the latter during the season. Curry, who reportedly had a worrying heart condition, refused to take a controversial DNA test, and fell out of favor with John Paxson, Chicago's general manager. The Bulls signed-and-traded him to the Knicks along with Antonio Davis for Tim Thomas, Michael Sweetney, the Knicks 2006 first round pick, {{and the right to}} swap first-round picks with the Knicks in 2007, as well as 2007 and 2009 second-round picks. <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> did not lottery-protect the picks, and the Knicks forfeited the second pick in the 2006 draft, and the ninth in the 2007 draft. With a bloated payroll, the Knicks stumbled to the second worst record in the NBA that season, at 23–59. The season concluded with the firing and $18.5 million buy-out of head coach Larry Brown after one season.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} 13 head coaches for the Pacers {{franchise}}. Larry Staverman {{was the first}} coach of the team in 1967, when the team was in the ABA. Coach Bobby Leonard has the most wins in franchise history, with 529 in his 12 seasons with the team. After Leonard, Jack McKinney, George Irvine, and Dr. Jack Ramsay. When Ramsay abruptly resigned in 1988 after the team {{got off to a}} horrid start, Pacers legend George McGinnis took over on an interim basis for two games, before Irvine returned for 20 more. Dick Versace then led the Pacers through another sub-par stretch before Bob Hill got the Pacers back to the playoffs and into contention. Then in 1993, Larry Brown joined the Pacers franchise and led the team to many playoff appearances as Reggie Miller blossomed into a superstar and eventual Hall of Famer. Larry Bird took over the team in 1997 and coached until 2000. Bird took the Pacers to their only NBA Finals appearance in the 1999–2000 season. <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas,</b> Rick Carlisle, and Jim O'Brien were next up as the Pacers top coach. The most recent head coach of the Pacers was Frank Vogel, until May 5, 2016 when his contract was not renewed after the number 7 seeded Pacers lost game 7 of {{the first round of the}} 2016 NBA Playoffs to the number two seeded Toronto Raptors. Subsequently, associate head coach Nate McMillan was promoted to the top spot.|$|E
25|$|With the {{departure}} of Brown, team president <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> took over the head coaching responsibilities. Thomas continued his practice of signing players to high priced contracts while the franchise struggled to capitalize on their talent on the court. As a testament to their struggles, on December 16, 2006, the Knicks and the Denver Nuggets broke into a brawl during their game in Madison Square Garden. With multiple players still serving a suspension {{as a result of}} the brawl, on December 20, 2006, David Lee created one of the most memorable plays in recent Knicks history, and served as a bright spot as the team's struggles persisted, during a game against the Charlotte Bobcats. With a tie game and 0.1 seconds left on the game clock in double overtime, Jamal Crawford inbounded from the sideline, near half-court. The ball sailed towards the basket, and with that 0.1 seconds still remaining on the game clock, Lee tipped the ball off of the backboard and into the hoop. Because of the Trent Tucker Rule, a player is allowed solely to tip the ball to score when the ball is put back into play with three-tenths of a second or less remaining. Because of this rule, the rarity of Lee's play increases. The Knicks won, 111–109 in double overtime. The Knicks improved by ten games in the 2006–2007 campaign in spite of injuries that ravaged the team at the end of the year; they ended with a 33–49 record, avoiding a 50-loss season by defeating the Charlotte Bobcats 94–93 on the last day of the season.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{got off to}} a 13–2 {{start in}} 2002–03, but hit the wall after the All-Star break thanks in no small part to Ron Artest's {{multiple}} suspensions and family tragedies befalling Jermaine O'Neal, Jamaal Tinsley and Austin Croshere. O'Neal and Brad Miller both made the All-Star team and the Pacers made a substantial improvement as they finished 48–34, but they suffered a loss to the underdog Boston Celtics {{in the first round of}} the playoffs. In the 2003 offseason, the Pacers managed to re-sign O'Neal for the NBA maximum and inked Reggie Miller to a modest two-year deal, but they could not afford to keep their talented center, Brad Miller. He was dealt to the Sacramento Kings in exchange for Scot Pollard, who spent much of the following year watching from the bench and backing up Jeff Foster. The Pacers also signed Larry Bird as team president, and Bird wasted little time in dismissing coach <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> and replacing him with Rick Carlisle. The Pacers responded to Carlisle extremely well, and had a breakthrough 2003–04 season in which they finished 61–21, earning the best record in the NBA as well as a franchise record. O'Neal and Artest made the All-Star team, and Artest was named the NBA's Defensive Player of the Year, the Pacers swept the Boston Celtics easily in the first round, and squeezed by a scrappy Miami Heat team in the conference semifinals. But the Detroit Pistons proved an impediment to Indiana's championship aspirations, as they defeated the Pacers in six games on their way to the NBA Championship.|$|E
25|$|The Pacers {{started the}} 2002–03 season well, winning 14 {{of their first}} 16 games, and had {{the best record in}} the East by the time the All-Star break arrived. The same team from the year before was playing better than ever, but the season fell apart in the latter half. For one, Brad Miller got injured and Indiana lost one of their most {{versatile}} players. Defensive lynchpin Artest suffered from too many emotional outbursts and this further hurt the Pacers, who could only finish the season 48–34. On his part, O'Neal kept up his All-Star numbers, averaging 20.8 points and 10.3 rebounds per game, being only one of three players in the NBA that year to pull off a 20/10. He was voted Eastern Conference Player of the Month twice, in January and April, and would go on to be named to the All-NBA Third Team again by the season's end. With no momentum heading into the playoffs, however, the Pacers were eliminated 4–2 by the underdog Boston Celtics, marking a first-round elimination for the third year in a row. Off the court, the team had also been facing family problems. Brad Miller's father-in-law and Tinsley's mother died during the season, and just before the playoffs, O'Neal's stepfather attempted suicide. When the season ended, O'Neal tried to keep his focus on basketball and considered the possibility of joining another team since he was now a free agent. The San Antonio Spurs, led by two-time NBA Champion Tim Duncan, looked an interesting proposition as perennial All-Star David Robinson had just retired. Much as it was tempting for O'Neal to make the switch, he opted not to uproot his family and signed a seven-year, $126 million contract with the Pacers. Even so, the offseason produced a few surprises for O'Neal when <b>Isiah</b> <b>Thomas</b> was replaced by Rick Carlisle, and Brad Miller left for the Sacramento Kings. Indiana was undergoing rebuilding yet again.|$|E
