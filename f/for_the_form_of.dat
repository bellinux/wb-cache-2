5|$|The use of {{live animals}} to {{represent}} the tribbles was immediately ruled out. According to Gerrold's account, the inspiration <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the tribble instead came from a fluffy keyring owned by Holly Sherman. Sherman's Planet in this episode was subsequently named after her. The design came from Wah Chang, but they were individually sewn by Jacqueline Cumeré. She was paid $350 to sew five hundred tribbles from synthetic fur and stuff them with foam rubber. Six ambulatory tribbles were made using the mechanisms of walking toy dogs, which were quite noisy and required the dialogue to be looped in during editing. Other tribbles were created by Jim Rugg out of beanbags for when it was required for one {{to sit on a}} person or object, and the breathing tribbles were hollow with surgical balloons inserted. Some of these tribbles were later displayed at the Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum in Washington D.C. in 1992. The sale at Christie's auction house in 2006 included tribbles from this episode {{as part of a larger}} Star Trek sale. Because of the synthetic fur technology of the 1960s, relatively few original tribbles exist as of 2010 because the fur fell out over time and they went bald. An original tribble was sold at auction in 2003 for $1,000.|$|E

The earliest literary evidence of this Christian usage for viaticum appears in Paulinus’s account of the death of Saint Ambrose in 397 AD.|$|E

5|$|Ain't is a {{contraction}} for am not, is not, are not, has not, {{and have}} not in the common English language vernacular.

The development <b>of</b> ain't <b>for</b> <b>the</b> various <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> to be not, to have not, and to do not occurred independently, at different times. The usage <b>of</b> ain't <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> to be not was established by the mid-18th century, and <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> to have not by the early 19th century.|$|R

500|$|... 90Sr {{has been}} used as a power source for {{radioisotope}} thermoelectric generators (RTGs). 90Sr produces approximately 0.93 watts of heat per gram (it is lower <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> 90Sr used in RTGs, which is strontium fluoride). However, 90Sr has one third the lifetime and a lower density than 238Pu, another RTG fuel. The main advantage of 90Sr is that it is cheaper than 238Pu and is found in nuclear waste. The Soviet Union deployed nearly 1000 of these RTGs on its northern coast as a power source for lighthouses and meteorology stations.|$|E
500|$|Early Restoration Movement leaders {{varied in}} {{their views of}} slavery, {{reflecting}} the range of positions common in the antebellum U.S. [...] Barton W. Stone was a strong opponent of slavery, arguing {{that there was no}} Biblical justification <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> slavery then being practiced in the United States and calling for immediate emancipation. [...] Alexander Campbell represented a more [...] "Jeffersonian" [...] opposition to slavery, writing of it as more of a political problem than as a religious or moral one. [...] Having seen Methodists and Baptists divide over the issue of slavery, Campbell argued that scripture regulated slavery rather than prohibited it, and that abolition {{should not be allowed to}} become an issue over which Christians would break fellowship with each other. [...] Like the country as a whole, the assumption of white racial superiority was almost universal among those on all sides of the issue, and it was common for congregations to have separate seating for black members.|$|E

500|$|Panduranga ( [...] , , all [...] ), also spelt as Pandurang and Pandaranga, {{is another}} popular epithet for Vithoba, which means 'the white god' in Sanskrit. The Jain author-saint Hemachandra (1089–1172 AD) notes {{it is also}} used as an epithet for the god Rudra-Shiva. Even though Vithoba is {{depicted}} with dark complexion, he is called a [...] "white god". Bhandarkar explains this paradox, proposing that Panduranga may be an epithet <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> Shiva worshipped in Pandharpur, and whose temple still stands. Later, with the increasing popularity of Vithoba's cult, this was also transferred to Vithoba. Another theory suggests that Vithoba may initially have been a Shaiva god (related to Shiva), only later identified with Vishnu, thus explaining the usage of Panduranga for Vithoba. Crooke, however, proposed that Panduranga is a Sanskritised form of Pandaraga (belonging to Pandarga), referring to the old name of Pandharpur. Another name, Pandharinath, also refers to Vithoba as the lord of Pandhari (yet another variant for Pandharpur).|$|E
500|$|The Dada series makes ample use of contrast, ellipses, ridiculous {{imagery and}} {{nonsensical}} verdicts.

[...] He called some of his own poems lampisteries, from a French word designating storage areas for light fixtures. The Lettrist poet Isidore Isou included such pieces in a succession of experiments inaugurated by Charles Baudelaire with the [...] "destruction of the anecdote <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> the poem", a process which, with Tzara, became [...] "destruction of the word for nothing".

2500|$|Lawson's work in Gothic design, {{like that}} of most other architects of this period, was clearly {{influenced}} by the style and philosophy of Augustus Pugin. However, he adapted the style <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>form</b> <b>of</b> congregational worship employed by [...] the Presbyterian denomination. The lack of ritual and religious processions rendered unnecessary a large chancel; hence in Lawson's version of the Gothic, the chancel and transepts (the areas which traditionally in Roman and Anglo-Catholic churches contained the Lady Chapel and other minor chapels) are merely hinted at in the design. Thus at First Church the tower is above {{the entrance to the}} building rather than in its traditional place in the centre of the church at the axis of nave, chancel and transepts. In all, Lawson designed over forty churches in the Gothic style. Like Benjamin Mountfort's, some were constructed entirely of wood; however, the majority were in stone.|$|E

The underhanded tactics actually cost Puma King's team the first fall as they were disqualified for cheating. The second match saw Puma King continue to gain an unfair advantage, only for Rey Cometa to use the La Casita roll-up move on Tiger King and pinned him to take the match two falls to none. Following the match Rey Cometa challenged Tiger King to put his mask on the line in a Lucha de Apuestas at a future date. Puma King sarcastically accepted, but only if it could take place in an empty arena, a ploy {{to get out of the}} match.|$|E
