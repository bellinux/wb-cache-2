50|$|<b>Hypertropia</b> is a {{condition}} of misalignment of the eyes (strabismus), whereby the visual axis of one eye {{is higher than the}} fellow fixating eye. Hypotropia is the similar condition, focus being on the eye with the visual axis lower than the fellow fixating eye. Dissociated Vertical Deviation is a special type of <b>hypertropia</b> leading to slow upward drift of one or rarely both eyes, usually when the patient is inattentive.|$|E
5000|$|... cyclotropia, a cyclotorsional {{deviation}} {{of the eyes}} (rotation around the visual axis), particularly when the root cause is an oblique muscle paresis causing the <b>hypertropia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Surgical {{correction}} of the <b>hypertropia</b> is desired to achieve binocularity, manage diplopia and/or correct the cosmetic defect. Steps {{to achieve the}} same depend on mechanism of the <b>hypertropia</b> and identification of the offending muscles causing the misalignment. Various surgical procedures have been described and should be offered after careful examination of eyes, including a detailed orthoptic examination focussing on the disturbances in ocular motility and visual status. Specialty fellowship trained pediatric ophthalmologists and strabismus surgeons are best equipped to deal with these complex procedures.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} side effects are droopy eyelids (ptosis) and over- or undercorrections; a further common side effects are {{diplopia}} and inadvertent vertical deviation (hypo- or <b>hypertropia).</b> The side effects typically resolve in 3-4 months.|$|E
50|$|In {{a patient}} with an unsuppressed {{vertical}} deviation, one line will appear higher than the other. If {{the image of the}} right eye is higher than that of the left, this means the right eye is lower than the left. This could be either a right hypotropia or a left <b>hypertropia.</b>|$|E
50|$|In exotropia {{the light}} {{lands on the}} medial aspect of the cornea. In esotropia the light lands on the lateral aspect of the cornea. In <b>hypertropia</b> the light lands on the {{inferior}} aspect of the cornea. In hypotropia the light lands on the superior aspect of the cornea. A cover test {{can tell you the}} extent of the eso/exotropia.|$|E
50|$|Sudden onset <b>hypertropia</b> in {{a middle}} aged or elderly adult {{may be due to}} {{compression}} of the trochlear nerve and mass effect from a tumor, requiring urgent brain imaging using MRI to localise any space occupying lesion. It could also be due to infarction of blood vessels supplying the nerve, due to diabetes and atherosclerosis. In other instances it may be due to an abnormality of neuromuscular transmission, i.e., Myasthenia Gravis.|$|E
50|$|In {{the first}} example, {{it has been}} noted that when {{conducting}} the PCT, this patient wore correction, was fixing left and has a twelve prism dioptre exotropia in the distance. At near they have a larger exotropic deviation measuring 18 prism dioptres. They also have a right <b>hypertropia</b> of six prism dioptres. This means that when the PCT was performed, the deviating eye was neutralised and no movement was seen at these points on the prism bar.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hypertropia</b> may {{be either}} {{congenital}} or acquired, and misalignment {{is due to}} imbalance in extraocular muscle function. The superior rectus, inferior rectus, superior oblique, and inferior oblique muscles affect the vertical movement of the eyes. These muscles may be either paretic, restrictive (fibrosis) or overactive effect of the muscles. Congenital cases may have developmental abnormality due to abnormal muscle structure, usually muscle atrophy / hypertrophy or rarely, absence of the muscle and incorrect placement.Specific & common causes include: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{directional}} prefixes {{are combined}} with -tropia and -phoria to describe {{various types of}} strabismus. For example, a constant left <b>hypertropia</b> exists when a patient's left eye is always aimed higher than the right. A patient with an intermittent right esotropia has a right eye that occasionally drifts toward the patient's nose, but at other times is able to align with {{the gaze of the}} left eye. A patient with a mild exophoria can maintain fusion during normal circumstances, but when the system is disrupted, the relaxed posture of the eyes is slightly divergent.|$|E
50|$|The fourth {{cranial nerve}} innervates the {{superior}} oblique muscle for each eye. The {{superior oblique muscle}} {{is one of the}} six extraocular muscles that allow movement of eye. Specifically, the superior oblique muscle primarily intorts the eye (such that the top of the eye rolls toward the nose), with secondary actions of depression (downgaze) and abduction (looking away from the nose). When this muscle’s function is diminished due to a fourth cranial nerve (CN IV) palsy, the affected eye will extort, deviate upward (<b>hypertropia),</b> and, to a smaller extent, drift inward.|$|E
5000|$|Skew {{deviation}} is {{an unusual}} ocular deviation (strabismus), wherein the eyes move upward (<b>hypertropia),</b> but in opposite directions. Skew deviation is caused by abnormal prenuclear vestibular input to the ocular motor nuclei, most commonly due to brainstem or cerebellar stroke. Other causes include multiple sclerosis and head trauma. Skew deviation is usually characterized by torticollis (head tilting) and binocular [...] The exact pathophysiology of skew deviation remains incompletely understood. Skew deviation {{appears to be a}} perturbation of the ocular tilt reaction, which is itself probably a vestigial righting response used to keep fish and other lateral-eyed animals properly oriented.|$|E
50|$|Strabismus {{can occur}} due to muscle dysfunction, farsightedness, {{problems}} in the brain, trauma, or infections. Risk factors include premature birth, cerebral palsy, and {{a family history of}} the condition. Types include esotropia where the eyes are crossed; exotropia where the eyes diverge; and <b>hypertropia</b> where they are vertically misaligned. They can also be classified by whether the problem is present in all directions a person looks (comitant) or varies by direction (incomitant). Diagnosis may be made by observing the light reflecting from the person's eyes and finding that it is not centered on the pupil. Another condition that produces similar symptoms is a cranial nerve disease.|$|E
50|$|It is {{performed}} by shining {{a light in}} the person's eyes and observing where the light reflects off the corneas. In a person with normal ocular alignment the light reflex lies slightly nasal {{from the center of}} the cornea (approximately 11 prism diopters—or 0.5mm from the pupillary axis), as a result of the cornea acting as a temporally-turned convex mirror to the observer. When doing the test, the light reflexes of both eyes are compared, and will be symmetrical in an individual with normal fixation. For an abnormal result, based on where the light lands on the cornea, the examiner can detect if there is an exotropia (abnormal eye is turned out), esotropia (abnormal eye is turned in), <b>hypertropia</b> (abnormal eye higher than the normal one) or hypotropia (abnormal eye is lower than the normal one).|$|E
50|$|The cover-uncover {{test can}} also be used for more {{problematic}} disorders of binocular vision, the tropias. In the cover part of the test, the examiner looks at the first eye as he or she covers the second. If the eye moves from out to in, the person has exotropia. If it moved from in to out, the person has esotropia. People with exotropia or esotropia are wall-eyed or cross-eyed respectively. These are forms of strabismus that can be accompanied by amblyopia. There are numerous definitions of amblyopia. A definition that incorporates all of these defines amblyopia as a unilateral condition in which vision in worse than 20/20 {{in the absence of any}} obvious structural or pathologic anomalies, but with one or more of the following conditions occurring before the age of six: amblyogenic anisometropia, constant unilateral esotropia or exotropia, amblyogenic bilateral isometropia, amblyogenic unilateral or bilateral astigmatism, image degradation. When the covered eye is the non-amblyopic eye, the amblyopic eye suddenly becomes the person's only means of seeing. The strabismus is revealed by the movement of that eye to fixate on the examiner's finger. There are also vertical tropias (<b>hypertropia</b> and hypotropia) and cyclotropias.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{the veracity of}} Jampolsky's statement that Bielschowsky's head tilt test is inverted if performed with the patient in the upside-down position and to interpret its neuromuscular mechanism. Methods: We present a series of 10 patients selected from a referred sample who were diagnosed with superior oblique paresis. <b>Hypertropia</b> was measured in the primary position, with the head erect and tilted toward both shoulders with the patient in the erect, supine, and upside-down positions. The last position was achieved by hanging the patient upside-down. Results: As expected, our results showed the veracity of Jampolsky's statement. The forced head tilt difference was inverted or significantly decreased when the test was performed in the upside-down position. Moreover, in all patients, Bielschowsky's phenomenon was neutralized in the supine body position, in which <b>hypertropia</b> with the head erect tended to vanish.

40|$|We {{report the}} effects of {{unilateral}} recession-resection surgery of the horizontal recti muscles with inferior displacement and augmented anterior transposition of the inferior oblique muscle with a posterior intermuscular suture in a patient with large exotropia and considerable <b>hypertropia.</b> Key Words: Strabismus In cases of monocular vision, many patients have a large horizontal deviation with or without vertical deviation [1, 2]. Even though bilateral surgery on multiple extraocular muscles may effectively correct these deviations, patients and surgeons alike are hesitant to proceed with surgery on the only normal eye.

40|$|Purpose: To {{report the}} case of a patient with large-angle <b>hypertropia</b> of an {{intramuscular}} hemangioma of the right superior rectus muscle (SR). Methods: A 63 -year-old man with progressive vertical deviation of the right eye for the past 6 months visited our strabismus department; his condition was not painful. An examination indicated that he had 60 PD of right <b>hypertropia</b> at distance and near in primary gaze. Additionally, a significant limitation of his downgaze was noted. The right eye appeared mildly proptotic, and the upper and lower eyelids were slightly edematous. Corrected vision was 20 / 20 in both eyes. Results: Orbital magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) studies revealed fusiform enlargement of the right superior rectus muscle, with prominent but irregular enhancement following gadolinium administration.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} the effectiveness of graded (adjustable intraoperatively) partial vertical rectus muscle tenotomy at the insertion in correcting small degrees of <b>hypertropia.</b> Methods: All patients with best-corrected visual acuity of better than 6 / 30 in both eyes who over a 30 -month period underwent partial tenotomy of vertical rectus muscle(s) only (no concurrent oblique muscles) were included. Improvement was evaluated 6 weeks postoperatively as change in alignment in prism diopters (PD) in primary gaze and in the field of action of the affected rectus muscle(s). Binocular function was evaluated by Titmus stereoacuity and the Worth 4 -light tests. Results: All 24 patients who met criteria for inclusion had diplopia preoperatively versus seven patients (29 %) postoper-atively (P <. 005, Student’s paired t test). Prisms were used by six preoperatively versus two postoperatively (P <. 05, Student’s paired t test). The average vertical deviation in primary gaze decreased from 8 PD to 2 PD (P <. 005, Student’s paired t test). In the field of action of the treated rectus muscle, <b>hypertropia</b> decreased from an average of 8 PD to 3 PD (P <. 005, Student’s paired t test). For the preoperative and the postoperative assessments available, stereoacuity improved after 10 (56 %) of the 18 procedures and Worth 4 -light testing showed improvement or maintenance of fusion after 15 (79 %) of 19 procedures. Conclusions: Graded vertical rectus partial tenotomy can effectively reduce small degrees of <b>hypertropia</b> and associated diplopia, improve binocular function, and reduce or eliminate the need for prism correction.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{and compare the}} effect of transposition of inferior oblique muscle in patients with primary inferior oblique muscle overaction and secondary due to superior oblique muscle palsy. Methods: The present study included 41 patients (53 eyes), who appeared to have primary or secondary inferior oblique muscle overaction due to superior oblique muscle palsy and received transposition of inferior oblique muscle with at least 3 months of fol-low-up. Patients were retrospectively analyzed to compare the effect of correction and its prognosis. Inferior oblique muscle over-action was graded as + 1 to + 4 according to the severity. Successful surgery was defined as postoperative inferior oblique muscle overaction from 0 to + 1 and failure as above + 2. <b>Hypertropia</b> in primary gaze was also recorded to evaluate the effect of correction. Results: Twenty-six (35 eyes) and 15 (18 eyes) patients with primary and secondary inferior oblique muscle overaction due to superior oblique muscle palsy, respectively, received transposition of inferior oblique muscle.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcome of}} strabismus surgery for congenital superior oblique palsy (SOP) in relation to correction of head tilt and <b>hypertropia.</b> The cohort of patients mainly involved very young children. This is the first study to use a standardized instrument to objectively measure torticollis before and after surgery. Materials and Methods: A non-comparative interventional case series of 13 cases of congenital superior oblique palsy with head tilt, who underwent simultaneous superior oblique tuck and inferior oblique recession between Jan 2000 and Dec 2008, were studied. Results: The mean duration of SOP until surgery was 36. 8 months. Of the 12 unilateral cases, 8 were right-sided. Mean follow-up period was 17 months (range 7 - 36). The outcome was determined at the last follow-up. Mean pre-and post-operative <b>hypertropia</b> (p. d.) in forced primary position was 19 ± 7 and 2 ± 6, respectively (P < 0. 0001). The head tilt reduced from mean of 17 ± 9 to 2 ± 2 degrees (P < 0. 0001). Success, defined as <b>hypertropia</b> < 5 PD and head tilt less than 5 degrees, was achieved in 69 % (9 / 13. C. I. 42 - 88 %) and 85 % (11 / 13. C. I. 56 - 96 %), respectively. The success rate for achieving both criteria was 61. 5 % (C. I. 35 - 88 %). Five patients required additional surgery; usually a contralateral inferior rectus muscle recession, which was successful in all cases. One case developed asymptomatic Brown syndrome (7. 69 % - C.

40|$|Purpose: To {{evaluate}} {{the outcomes of}} botulinum toxin injection into the inferior oblique (IO) muscle for management of unilateral acute traumatic superior oblique (SO) palsy. Methods: In this prospective case series, 10 - 20 units of botulinum toxin A (Dysport, Ipsen, Biopharm Ltd., Wrexham, UK) was injected into the ipsilateral IO muscle of 13 consecutive patients with unilateral acute traumatic SO palsy. All patients received injections within four weeks of the incident. Results: Mean age was 29 ± 15 years and 12 (92 %) subjects were male. Mean amount of <b>hypertropia</b> (in primary position) was decreased from 10. 0 ± 3. 9 Δ at baseline to 4. 6 ± 8. 9 Δ, {{one month after the}} injection, and to 1. 5 ± 2. 7 Δ at final follow-up (P = 0. 001). IO overaction improved from 2. 7 ± 0. 6 to 1. 0 ± 1. 2 and 0. 6 ± 0. 9 (P ≤ 0. 001), and subjective torsion from 5. 3 ± 3. 9 to 3. 2 ± 3. 4 and 1. 6 ± 2. 5 degrees (P ≤ 0. 001), at the same time intervals respectively. One month after the injection as well as at final follow-up, 10 (77 %) patients were diplopia-free in primary and reading positions.

Forty-one congenital SOP patients without a trochlear nerve (absent group) and 23 patients with a trochlear nerve (present group) who underwent IO myectomy as the primary surgical treatment were retrospectively reviewed. "Motor success" was defined as postoperative ipsilateral <b>hypertropia</b> ≤ 4 prism diopter (PD). "Head tilt improvement" was regarded as postoperative angle of head tilt < 5 degrees (°). Success rates for motor alignment and head tilt improvement, cumulative probabilities of success, and factors influencing surgical responses were evaluated. The cumulative probabilities of motor success at 2 years after IO myectomy were 92 % in patients with a trochlear nerve and 86 % in patients without a trochlear nerve (P = 0. 138). The cumulative probabilities of undercorrection and recurrence of <b>hypertropia</b> after 2 years were 0 % in the present group versus 21 % in the absent group (P = 0. 014).

We frequently found a nonlinear relation between length and tension, unlike our previous findings in recti. In superior oblique palsies, the superior oblique was found, before injection of succinylcholine, to be stiff after elongation, and did not contract after injection of succinylcholine, while the ipsilateral inferior oblique contract after injection of succinylcholine, but with a higher spring constant than did usual.
