The usefulness of irradiation after resection is controversial in the literature. This article describes the experiences gained in the Academic Medical Centre of Amsterdam with pre- and postoperative irradiation of resectable Klatskin tumours. Preoperative irradiation (10. 5 Gy) is administered to devitalize detached tumour cells in the bile, to prevent implantation metastases after resection. Postoperative irradiation has been administered since 1986 according to protocol.

Two photocatalysts (TiO 2 P 25 and TiO 2 PC 500) were tested and the dye degradation was studied for different initial pollutant concentrations (10 - 117 mg L− 1).

Cervical cancer continues {{to be one of}} the most common cancers and one of the leading causes of cancer deaths globally. Women's experiences of undergoing internal radiation for cervical cancer remain relatively unexplored, in particular in Hong Kong. Better understanding of the experiences of this specific group could inform the provision of supportive care services and provide useful information to be included in education programmes for them. Method. A phenomenological approach was adopted and unstructured telephone interviews were carried out with eight participants between July and October 2004. The interviews were audio-taped and analysed using the procedures described by Giorgi, 1985. Findings. Three themes were identified from the data: (1) isolation versus social intercourse, (2) unbearable symptom distress versus endurance and coping and (3) growth from the experience. The most distressing aspects of undergoing <b>internal</b> cervical <b>irradiation</b> reported by the patients were the experience of isolation and various physical and psychological symptoms. Specific provisions in the physical environment, psychological support provided by healthcare professionals, family and fellow patients and a positive attitude helped them to cope.

Four academic radiation therapy departments located on the Southeast Coast of China were selected for the study. The survey was conducted on female breast cancer patients who received radiotherapy in 1999 and 2006. The questionnaires were designed to determine the purposes of radiotherapy and to address the postoperative radiotherapy techniques used. The data for these two years were analyzed and compared. Results. The percentage of breast-conserving treatment increased from 3 % in 1999 to 13 % in 2006, but the percentage of patients treated with postmastectomy radiotherapy dropped from 69 % in 1999 to 66 % in 2006 (P< 0. 05). As regards the changes in techniques from 1999 to 2006, the use of special immobilization devices, treatment planning systems, and CT simulations increased from 46 % to 80 %, 23 % to 70 %, and 0 % to 14 %, respectively (P< 0. 01). From 1999 to 2006, irradiation of the chest wall following mastectomy increased from 67 % to 90 %, but for <b>internal</b> mammary <b>irradiation</b> it decreased from 76 % to 30 % and for the axilla, from 69 % to 37 % (P< 0. 01). There were no obvious differences between 1999 and 2006 on the field design, boost treatment on the tumor bed, or dose prescription. Conclusions. Breast-conserving treatment was performed more frequently in China in 2006 than in 1999, but postmastectomy radiotherapy did not change a great deal and it was still an essential option. Although the international treatment guidelines have been accepted and implemented by physicians in recent years, prompt improvement in the quality of breast cancer radiotherapy is needed.

The villages were situated about 180 km from the Chernobyl power plant and the deposition of 137 Cs was in the range 0. 9 - 2. 7 MBq m- 2. Yearly expeditions were conducted in autumn {{by members of the}} Departments of Radiation Physics in Malmö and Göteborg, Institute of Radiation Hygiene, St. Petersburg, and the first years also the Norwegian Radiation Protection Authority. The dose levels and their change in time were investigated for various groups of the general public. The body burden of 137, 134 Cs, and hence, {{the effective}} dose, was estimated from measurements of the urinary concentration of caesium radionuclides, together with direct measurements of the body content using a portable detector. The effective dose from external irradiation was estimated from measurements with thermoluminescent (TL) -dosemeters worn by the participants during one month each year. In a special case study, the changes in biokinetics of 137 Cs during pregnancy was investigated in a woman with an unintended intake of 137 Cs via mushrooms from a highly contaminated forest in the area. During pregnancy there is an increased excretion of caesium resulting in a biological half-time of caesium which was 54 % of the half-time before pregnancy. The ratio of the 137 Cs concentration in breast milk (Bq L- 1) to that in the mother’s body (Bq kg- 1) was 15 % one month after the child was born. The body burden of 137 Cs in the Russian individuals calculated from the concentration of 137 Cs in urine showed a good agreement with the body burden estimated from in vivo measurements in the same individuals. Normalisation of the caesium concentration in the urine samples by the use of potassium or creatinine excretion was found to introduce systematic differences as well as a larger spread in the calculated values of the 137 Cs body burden as compared with calculations without normalisation, using the urinary concentration of 137 Cs only. The yearly effective dose from external and <b>internal</b> <b>irradiation</b> to inhabitants in the Russian villages varied between 1. 2 and 2. 5 mSv as a mean for all villages studied between 1991 and 1998 and the internal effective dose was, on average, 30 - 50 % of the total effective dose during that period. The effective dose from external irradiation decreased on average 15 % per year, while the effective dose from <b>internal</b> <b>irradiation</b> varied, depending to a great extent on dietary habits and especially the availability of mushrooms. The cumulated effective dose for a 70 -year period after the accident was calculated to be around 100 mSv with the assumption that the effective dose will decrease by only the physical decay of 137 Cs (2 % per year) after 1998.

Neither micro-bubble formation nor crystallisation are evidenced, but the irradiated glasses exhibit an anisotropic deformation under the ion beam. The main crack mode developed during scratching is shifted from radial for the pristine glasses to lateral for all the irradiated glasses. The hardness of each glass decreases when irradiated for all the incident ions used. This decrease {{appears to be in}} close relation with the electronic stopping power of the incident particle, and is associated with a change in the indentation mechanism (from normal to anomalous behaviour). The evolution of the scratches in the material depth confirms the change in deformation mechanism and the strong dependence between the hardness of the irradiated material and the electronic stopping power of the incident ion.

The occurrence of intergranular fracture in the irradiated steels is briefly reviewed based on limited literature data. The data are sorted {{according to the}} irradiation temperature. Intergranular fracture may occur in association with a high irradiation temperature and void swelling.

The intergranular fracture occurrence at low temperatures might be correlated with decohesion or twinning and strain martensite transformation in local narrow areas around grain boundaries. The possibility of a ductile-to-brittle transition is also discussed. In case of void swelling higher than 3 %, quasi-cleavage at low temperature might be expected as a consequence of ductile-to-brittle fracture changes with temperature.

Flux thimbles have also been made from Ni-rich alloys {{in the past but}} are gradually being replaced by thimbles made from other alloys containing substantially less Ni. In a CANDU reactor, Ni-alloys are used as tensioning springs, fuel channel spacers (in the form of garter springs) and as cable sheathing and core wires in flux-detector assemblies. Prediction of the irradiationprocesses that affect the functionality of these CANDU <b>internals,</b> such as <b>irradiation</b> embrittlement and irradiation creep, especially under conditions of extended operation, necessitates a consideration of the effect of the transmutation of Ni. Over the past 10 years, there has been a considerable increase in the understanding of the effects of irradiation on the properties of components made from Ni-rich alloys. The nuclear processes and the effects of irradiation damage on the performance of components made from these alloys will be described...|$|R
