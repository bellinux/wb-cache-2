5|$|Pianist McCoy Tyner, {{who grew}} up close to the Powell {{brothers}} in Philadelphia, was influenced by their relatively heavy keyboard touch and their liking of percussive piano sounds. Tyner also <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> his inspiration for chord voicings from hearing Richie's use of left-hand fourths. Tyner's voicings became the norm for young jazz pianists.|$|E

5|$|As {{early as}} May 1941, the NDH had asked Germany for, among other things, 22 Messerschmitt Bf 109s. Instead, they <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the {{remaining}} largely obsolete aircraft of the VVKJ. At the same time, Germany appropriated six captured Dornier Do 17K bombers, {{which were then}} supplied to Bulgaria. Romania received six ex-VVKJ Hawker Hurricanes, as well as six Bristol Blenheims, whilst Finland received 20 half-completed Blenheims, together with manufacturing tools and production equipment, {{as well as a}} huge variety of spare parts.|$|E

Uva also <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the best upcoming local Sri Lankan players.|$|E

Trees brought {{only two}} or three cents each, as opposed to the [...] "fippenny bit" [...] (about six and a quarter cents) that he usually <b>got.</b> <b>Some</b> <b>of</b> his land was sold for taxes following his death, and litigation used up much of the rest.|$|E

2500|$|The {{standard}} [...] and optional [...] engines {{were carried}} forward from 1964. The previous [...] Spyder engine {{was replaced by}} the normally aspirated [...] for the new Corsa. The engine was unusual in offering four single-throat carburetors, to which were added larger valves and a dual exhaust system. A [...] turbocharged engine was optional on the Corsa, which offered either standard three-speed or optional (US$92) four-speed manual transmissions. The [...] engine was optional on 500 and Monza models with manual or Powerglide transmissions. [...] All engines <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the heavy-duty internal parts from the Turbocharged engine for better durability.|$|E
2500|$|Kyle MacLachlan says Dylan McDermott was {{the first}} choice for the {{character}} of Zack Carey, but he declined and MacLachlan was then cast. The actor later recalled, [...] "That was a decision {{that was sort of}} a tough one to make, but I was enchanted with Paul Verhoeven. Particularly Robocop, which I loved. I look back on it now and it’s a little dated, but it’s still fantastic, and I think it’s <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the great villains of all time in there. It was Verhoeven and [...] Eszterhas, and it seemed like {{it was going to be}} kind of dark and edgy and disturbing and real." ...|$|E

In 2001, West produced the bulk of Jay-Z's successful and highly praised album The Blueprint, implementing an augmented version of a technique pioneered by RZA; Kanye has since revealed that the beats he and fellow Roc producer Just Blaze produced were originally created for Ghostface Killah, before announcing that Ghostface inspired his sound and style.

2500|$|The Daily News and The Globe both {{noted that}} Act I ran {{longer than any}} {{previous}} Savoy Opera and needed pruning. The Manchester Guardian praised the work, but commented that there was [...] "much (sometimes too much) Gilbertian dialogue". However, Gilbert and Sullivan's choices for what to cut are suspect. [...] The soprano's aria, [...] "Youth is a boon avowed" [...] <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> the most enthusiastic reviews from the press but was cut after the opening night. [...] The Globe called it [...] "one of Sir Arthur Sullivan's best works". [...] Also, the pre-production cuts left subplots that were introduced in Act I unresolved. [...] For example, Sullivan refused to set one of Gilbert's scenes for Nancy McIntosh, which left the Scaphio–Phantis–Zara subplot unresolved. [...] Rutland Barrington, in his memoirs, felt that the [...] "second act... was not as full of fun as usual" [...] in the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.|$|E
2500|$|While Tyler herself {{does not}} {{like to think of}} her novels in terms of themes, {{numerous}} reviewers and scholars have noted the importance of family and marriage relationships to her characters and stories. Liesl Schillinger summarized: “Taken together, the distinct but overlapping worlds of her novels have formed a Sensurround literary record of the 20th century American family—or, at least, of the proud but troubled archetypal families that…interested her most." [...] Michiko Kakutani, Pulitzer Prize-winning critic for The New York Times, has been reviewing Tyler novels for over 25 years. [...] She has frequently noted Tyler’s themes with regard to family and marriage. [...] Reviewing Noah's Compass, Kakutani states that “the central concern of most of this author’s characters has always been their need to define themselves in terms of family — {{the degree to which they}} see themselves as creatures shaped by genetics, childhood memories and parental and spousal expectations, and the degree to which they are driven to embrace independent identities of their own.”. This is an example of where Anne Tyler <b>got</b> <b>some</b> <b>of</b> her characteristics from, being able to be independent and get to know herself through her writing.|$|E
