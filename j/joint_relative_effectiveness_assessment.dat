40|$|PURPOSE: The aim of {{this study}} is to {{investigate}} the role of health-related quality-of-life (QoL) data in <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessments</b> (REAs) of new anti-cancer drugs across European jurisdictions, during health technology assessment procedures. METHODS: Comparative analysis of guidelines and publicly available REAs in six European jurisdictions of anti-cancer drugs approved by EMA between 2011 and 2013. RESULTS: Fourteen anti-cancer drugs were included, adding up to 79 REAs. Whilst all guidelines state that QoL is a relevant endpoint to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of new cancer drugs, QoL data were included in only 54 % of the 79 reports and their impact on the recommendations was limited. CONCLUSIONS: Whilst national guidelines recognize the relevance of QoL to determine the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of new anti-cancer drugs, this is not well-reflected in current assessments. Developing and implementing into REAs specific evidence requirements for QoL data would improve the use of this patient-centred outcome in future reimbursement and pricing decisions...|$|R
40|$|Clinical {{endpoints}} {{relevant for}} <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment</b> (REA) reflect how patients feel, function, or survive. Outcome data requested by Health Technology Assessment (HTA) bodies in Europe to support reimbursement of an anticancer drug {{are based on}} final endpoints coming from completed comparative phase 3 trials; overall survival improvement is the preferred criterion for the demonstration of the patient benefit in this field. Recent arrival of new treatments that target identified functional genetic mutations (targeted therapies) or PD- 1 /PD-L 1, 2 axis (immunotherapies) and their combinations have profoundly changed treatment strategies in cancers as they considerably improve patient survival, but also raise new challenges in REA and decision making process in Europe {{as compared to the}} REA of classical chemotherapies. In addition, recent regulatory initiatives to support accelerated clinical development and approval of innovative cancer immunotherapies based on non-final endpoints, such as Priority Medicines (PRIME) through the European Medicines Agency (EMA), represent an additional challenge for HTA bodies and decision makers. In order to support adequate data generation for REA of anticancer drugs and especially for drugs candidates for accelerated assessment and early access to market, a close and open dialogue of all stakeholders involved in development of such drugs is crucia...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to identify the possible barriers and critical success factors for the implementation of European collaboration in the field of <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment</b> (REA) of drugs. MethodsData were gathered through semi-structured interviews with representatives from eight European health technology assessment (HTA) organisations involved in assessment of drugs for coverage decision-making (AAZ, AIFA, AHTAPol, HAS, HVB, IQWIG, NICE and ZiN). ResultsPotential barriers identified mainly relate to methodology, resources and challenges with implementation in the respective national processes (e. g. legal restrictions). The most critical success factors for production of cross-border assessments were the continuous cooperation of competent partners, and the quality and timely availability of the assessment. ConclusionFurther adaptation of the process and methods is required for optimal collaboration. In the near future it can be expected that cross-border assessments will meet in particular the needs of smaller/middle-sized European countries and also European countries with less developed HTA systems as the potential efficiency/quality gains are the highest for these countries. Therefore, national implementation of cross-border assessments is especially likely in these countries in the coming years. Once more experience is gained with cross-border assessments, and successes become more evident, efficiency/quality gains may also be likely for some larger countries with well established processes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Randomized {{controlled}} trials provide robust data on {{the efficacy}} of interventions rather than on <b>effectiveness.</b> Health technology <b>assessment</b> (HTA) agencies worldwide are thus exploring whether real-world data (RWD) may provide alternative sources of data on effectiveness of interventions. Presently, an overview of HTA agencies' policies for RWD use in <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessments</b> (REA) is lacking. Objectives: To review policies of six European HTA agencies on RWD use in REA of drugs. A literature review and stakeholder interviews were conducted to collect information on RWD policies for six agencies: the Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (Sweden), the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (United Kingdom), the Institute for Quality and Efficiency in Healthcare (Germany), the High Authority for Health (France), the Italian Medicines Agency (Italy), and the National Healthcare Institute (The Netherlands). The following contexts for RWD use in REA of drugs were reviewed: initial reimbursement discussions, pharmacoeconomic analyses, and conditional reimbursement schemes. We identified 13 policy documents and 9 academic publications, and conducted 6 interviews. Results: Policies for RWD use in REA of drugs notably differed across contexts. Moreover, policies differed between HTA agencies. Such variations might discourage the use of RWD for HTA. Conclusions: To facilitate the use of RWD for HTA across Europe, more alignment of policies seems necessary. Recent articles and project proposals of the European network of HTA may provide a starting point to achieve this.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare evidence requirements for health technology assessment of pharmaceuticals by national agencies across Europe responsible for reimbursement decisions focusing specifically on <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment.</b> METHODS: Evidence requirements from thirty-three European countries were requested and twenty-nine national agencies provided documents to review. Data were extracted from national documents (manufacturer's submission templates and associated guidance) into a purpose-made framework with categories covering information about the health condition, the technology, clinical effectiveness and safety. RESULTS: The level of detail in the required evidence varies considerably across countries. Some countries include specific questions while others request information under general headings. Some countries include all information in a single document, which may or may not include guidance on how to complete the template. Others have specific guidance documents or methods and process manuals that help with the completion of the submission templates. Despite differences in quantity and detail, the content of the evidence requirements is broadly similar. All countries ask for information on the health technology, target disease, and clinical effectiveness and safety. However, one country only requests clinical effectiveness information as part of cost-effectiveness analyses. We found twenty-six evidence requirements for which generic answers may apply across borders and nineteen in which countries requested nationally specific information. CONCLUSIONS: This work suggests that it would be possible to put together a minimum set of evidence requirements for HTA to support reimbursement decisions across Europe which could facilitate collaboration between jurisdictions...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: There is {{a debate}} on the added {{clinical}} value of new, expensive, anticancer treatments. Among European decision makers, the relevance of commonly used endpoints in trials, especially overall survival (OS), progression-free survival (PFS) {{and quality of life}} (QoL) varies, leading to the available evidence being valued differently. This research studies {{the extent to which the}} value of endpoints for cancer medicines differs among European decision makers. METHODS: We compared guidelines and <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessments</b> (REAs) of medicines for pricing or reimbursement decisions in England, France, Germany, Netherlands, Poland and Scotland. Anticancer medicines that received marketing authorisation in Europe between 2011 - 2013 with at least four available national REAs were evaluated. A total of 79 REAs were included. RESULTS: Health technology assessment (HTA) guidelines indicate a preference for clinically and patient relevant endpoints such as OS and QoL above surrogate endpoints. Most guidelines do not specify whether PFS is considered a surrogate or patient-relevant endpoint. The number of REAs included per jurisdiction varied between 7 (The Netherlands) and 18 (Germany). OS data were included in all REAs and were the preferred endpoint by HTA agencies, but these data were not always mature or robust. QoL data are included in only 54 % of the REAs, with a limited impact on the recommendations. PFS data are included in 70 % of the REAs, but the extent to which HTA agencies find PFS relevant varies. CONCLUSIONS: European decision making on <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of anticancer medicines is affected by a gap in requested versus available clinical evidence, mainly because the regulator is willing to accept some degree of clinical uncertainty. A multi-stakeholder debate would be essential to align concrete robust evidence requirements in oncology and a collectively shared definition for relevant clinical benefit, which will benefit patients and society in general...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: In many European jurisdictions, <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessments</b> (REAs) of {{pharmaceuticals}} {{are performed}} during the reimbursement decision-making process. International collaboration {{in the production}} of these assessments may prevent the duplication of information in various jurisdictions. A first pilot of a joint REA (pazopanib for the treatment of renal cell carcinoma) was published in 2011. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to investigate how well the methods used in the joint REA match the methods used in the national/local assessments on the same topic. METHODS: National/local assessments from European jurisdictions, available in English language, were identified through a literature search and an e-mail request to health technology assessment organizations. Data were abstracted from joint and national/local assessments using a structured data abstraction form. Results were compared for differences and similarities. RESULTS: In total, five national/local reports were included (Belgium, England/Wales, France, The Netherlands, and Scotland). The general methods (indication, main comparator, main end points, main trial) were similar. The details of the assessment (e. g., exact wording of indication, additional comparators, additional trials included, and method of indirect comparison), however, varied. Despite these differences, the joint REA included nearly all comparators, end points, trials, and methods of analysis that were used in national/local REA reports. CONCLUSIONS: This study has shown overlap in the methods national/local REA bodies in Europe have chosen for a pazopanib REA for renal cell carcinoma, except for the use and methods of indirect comparisons.

40|$|AbstractObjectiveAssessment of the {{effectiveness}} compared with alternative treatment(s) {{plays an important role}} in many jurisdictions in determining the reimbursement status of pharmaceuticals. This type of assessment is often referred to as a <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment</b> (REA) and is carried out by many jurisdictions. Increased sharing of information across jurisdictions may save costs and reduce duplication. The objective of this study was to explore the main similarities and differences in the major methodological aspects of REA in multiple jurisdictions. MethodsData were gathered with a standardized data extraction form by searching publicly available information and by eliciting information from representatives at relevant organizations. ResultsOf the initially included 35 jurisdictions, data were gathered for 29 jurisdictions. There seem to be substantial similarities on the choice of the comparator, the role of indirect comparisons, and preferred end points in REAs (except for the use of health state utilities). Jurisdictions, however, differ in whether effectiveness (usual circumstances of health care practice) is estimated in case no (comparative) effectiveness data are available and how this is done. ConclusionSome important methodological aspects for REA are approached in a similar way in many jurisdictions, indicating that collaboration on assessments may be feasible. Enhanced collaboration in the development of methods and best practices for REA between jurisdictions will be a necessary first step. Important topics for developing best practice are indirect comparisons and how to handle the gap between efficacy and effectiveness data in case good quality comparative effectiveness data are not yet available at the time of reimbursement decisions...|$|R

40|$|The {{national}} reimbursement {{decisions of}} new medicines in European countries {{are based on}} multiple criteria, such as the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> value for money, costs, social and ethical considerations. The <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{is the extent to}} which an intervention does more good than harm compared to already available treatment(s). Although reimbursement criteria differ per country, the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> is very relevant in many European countries. For this reason, multiple countries simultaneously write their own <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment</b> (REA) report of the same medicine. There are potential quality and efficiency gains for European countries to collaborate in the production of these REAs. Since more harmonisation is a prerequisite for collaboration, we have studied the possibilities for harmonising REAs in Europe. There is general willingness to cooperate in the development and standardisation of methods for REAs in Europe and it is expected to lead to an increase of quality and expertise throughout Europe. But, the willingness to produce and use joint REAs is not yet shared by all countries, and increases with potential efficiency gains. The potential efficiency gains are highest for smaller/middle-sized European countries and also European countries with less developed HTA systems. We found that important methodological aspects for REAs are approached in a similar way in many European jurisdictions. Nonetheless, there are also differences that should be considered when jointly producing REAs (hereafter referred as joint REAs). In order to cover the needs of multiple jurisdictions joint REAs should be comprehensive in terms of relevant comparators, endpoints, studies included and the uncertainty of the evidence. If there is a lot of variation in treatment patterns between countries or if multiple comparators are available indirect comparisons are likely to play a relevant role in joint REAs, as it is highly unlikely that direct evidence is available for all comparisons. Although available pilot joint REAs seem to cover the needs of multiple jurisdictions from a methodological point of view, the actual use is still limited. Other factors seem to play a relevant role such as timing of the joint REA and not optimal alignment with national procedures. More emphasis needs to be put on these issues in order to realise national use of the reports. Harmonisation of REAs in Europe is feasible, but the production and use of joint REAs follows rather an evolutionary path instead of disruptive introduction. It is driven by jurisdictions that have the highest efficiency gains. Further alignment of methods and procedures is required to enhance harmonisation. The need for alignment of evidence requirements before and after market approval goes beyond national efficiencies and requires a multi-stakeholder debate between regulatory agencies, HTA agencies, and pharmaceutical companies. A common understanding and common policies of evidence requirement for a new medicine will improve the drug development and thus help patients in need for effective, safe and affordable treatments...|$|R

Methods: We performed a systematic literature search in databases including MEDLINE via OVID, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and CRD (DARE, NHS-EED, HTA). The evidence obtained was summarized according to GRADE methodology. A health technology assessment (HTA) was conducted using the HTA Core Model® for rapid <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> <b>assessment.</b> Primary outcomes for the clinical effectiveness domain were all-cause and disease-specific mortality. Outcomes for the safety domain were adverse events (AEs) and serious adverse events (SAEs). A focus group with cardiac disease patients was conducted to evaluate ethical, organizational, patient, social, and legal aspects of the WCD use. Results: No randomized- or non-randomized controlled trials were identified. Non-comparative studies (n= 5) reported AEs including skin rash/itching (6 %), false alarms (14 %), and palpitations/light-headedness/fainting (9 %) and discontinuation due to comfort/lifestyle issues (16 – 22 %), and SAEs including inappropriate shocks (0 – 2 %), unsuccessful shocks (0 – 0. 7 %), and death (0 – 0. 3 %). The focus group results reported that experiencing {{a sense of security}} is crucial to patients and that the WCD is not considered an option for weeks or even months due to expected restrictions in living a “normal” life. Conclusion: The WCD appears to be relatively safe for short-to-medium term, but the quality of existing evidence is very low. AEs and SAEs need to be more appropriately reported in order to further evaluate the safety of the device. High-quality comparative evidence and well-described disease groups are required to assess the effectiveness of the WCD and to determine which patient groups may benefit most from the intervention.

40|$|Assessing offenders' risk {{of future}} violent {{behavior}} {{continues to be}} an important yet controversial role of forensic psychologists. A key debate is the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of <b>assessment</b> methods. Specifically, actuarial methods (see Quinsey et al., 1998 for a review) have been compared and contrasted to clinical and structured clinical methods (see e. g. Hart, 1998; Webster et al., 1997). Proponents of each approach argue for its superiority, yet validity studies have made few formal comparisons. In advancing the available research, the present study examines systematically the type of forensic case (i. e., sexual violence versus nonsexual violence) and type of assessment method (i. e., actuarial, structured clinical, and unstructured clinical). As observed by Borum, Otto, and Golding (1993), forensic decision making can also be influenced by the presence of certain extraneous clinical data. To address these issues, psychologists and doctoral students attending the American Psychology Law Society conference were asked to make several ratings regarding the likelihood of future sexual and nonsexual violence based on data derived from actual defendants with known outcomes. Using a mixed factorial design, each of these assessment methods were investigated for its influence on decision-makers regarding likelihood of future violence and sexually violent predator commitments. Finally, the potentially biasing effects of victim impact statements on resultant decisions were also explored...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Pharmaceuticals' <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> {{has come}} to the fore in the policy arena, {{reflecting}} the need to understand how relative efficacy (what can work) translates into added benefit in routine clinical use (what does work). European payers and licensing authorities assess value for money and post-launch benefit-risk profiles, and efforts to standardize <b>assessments</b> of <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> across the European Union (EU) are under way. However, the ways that <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> differs across EU healthcare settings are poorly understood. METHODS: To understand which factors influence differences in <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> we developed an analytical framework that treats the healthcare system as a health production function. Using evidence on breast cancer from England, Spain, and Sweden as a case study, we investigated the reasons why the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of a new drug might vary across healthcare systems. Evidence was identified from a literature review and national clinical guidance. RESULTS: The review included thirteen international studies and thirty country-specific studies. Cross-country differences in population age structure, deprivation, and educational attainment were consistently associated with variation in outcomes. Screening intensity appeared to drive differences in survival, although the impact on mortality was unclear. CONCLUSIONS: The way efficacy translates into <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> across health systems is likely to be influenced by a range of complex and interrelated factors. These factors could inform government and payer policy decisions on ways to optimize <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness,</b> and help increase understanding of the potential transferability of data on <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> from one health system to another...|$|R
40|$|Murdoch and Krewski (1988) {{introduced}} {{the concept of}} the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> of dosing in models of carcinogenesis with time-dependent exposure. Under certain models, such as the Armitage [...] Doll multistage model with a single stage dose-dependent, the hazard H(t) from any pattern of dosing d(Â·) may be calculated under a constant dosing model using an equivalent constant dose d*(t) which is simply an average of the true dose rate weighted proportionally to the <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> at each time from 0 to t.

In Europe, {{this is because of}} the need for early {{information}} to guide reimbursement and funding decisions about new medical technologies. However, ways that effectiveness (does it work?) and efficacy (can it work?) might differ across health systems are poorly understood. METHODS: This study proposes an analytical framework, drawing on production function theory, to systematically identify and quantify the determinants of <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> and sources of variation between populations and healthcare systems. We consider how methods such as stochastic frontier analysis and data envelopment analysis using a Malmquist productivity index could in principle be used to generate evidence on, and improve understanding about, the sources of variation in <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> between countries and over time. RESULTS: Better evidence on factors driving <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> could: inform decisions on how to best use a new technology to maximum effectiveness; establish the need if any for follow-up post-launch studies, and provide evidence of the impact of new health technologies on outcomes in different healthcare systems. CONCLUSIONS: The health production function approach for <b>assessment</b> of <b>relative</b> <b>effectiveness</b> is complementary to traditional experimental and observational studies, focusing on identifying, collecting, and analyzing data at the national level, enabling comparisons to take place.
