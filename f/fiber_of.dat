25|$|Nigel Hitchin {{introduced}} {{the notion of}} a generalized almost complex structure on the manifold M, which was elaborated in the doctoral dissertations of his students Marco Gualtieri and Gil Cavalcanti. An ordinary almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional subspace of each <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the complexified tangent bundle TM. A generalized almost complex structure is a choice of a half-dimensional isotropic subspace of each <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the direct sum of the complexified tangent and cotangent bundles. In both cases one demands that the direct sum of the subbundle and its complex conjugate yield the original bundle.|$|E

25|$|Silk is {{a natural}} protein fiber, some forms {{of which can be}} woven into textiles. The protein <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> silk is {{composed}} mainly of fibroin and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.|$|E
25|$|Softness: Cashmere {{is known}} in the textile {{industry}} {{as one of the}} softest wools with a fiber diameter of less than 18.5. The diameter of the down <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the Yak also ranges 16-20 microns making its softness comparable to that of cashmere. Species-specific DNA probes have been developed to identify yak, which is used to quantitatively test yak-cashmere blends. Although cashmere has already been firmly established in the market, yak wool has potential to be sold as a luxury product due to its softness and the (currently) sustainable and eco-friendly means used for gathering the fibers.|$|E

40|$|A {{structure}} for supporting {{and at least}} transferring heat energy away from at least a first heat source interconnected thereto is disclosed. In one embodiment, the structure includes a deck member having a plurality of layers <b>of</b> thermally conductive <b>fibers</b> packed within a matrix material. <b>Fibers</b> <b>of</b> at least a first layer are orientable to transfer heat energy toward at least a first sidewall of the deck member, and <b>fibers</b> <b>of</b> at least a second layer are orientable about. +-. 45. degree. relative to the <b>fibers</b> <b>of</b> the first layer to enhance the structural strength of the deck member.

25|$|After being sorted, {{washed and}} chopped up, they proceed into large steel vats for preservation/precooking {{and also to}} destroy any {{bacteria}} that could be harmful {{for the rest of}} the processing period as well as for the consumer after production. The juice will be extracted out by a juice extraction system. The outer skin, seed, stem, and <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> fruits would be separated from the juice in a process known as pulping. Once separated, the juice and the pulp from the tomato get filtered and processed into ketchup. A smoother ketchup consistency is achieved through more filtering and screenings, weeding out any excess pulp.|$|E
25|$|Although {{cellulose}} forms {{a distinct}} crystalline structure, cellulose fibers in nature are not purely crystalline. In {{addition to the}} crystalline and amorphous regions, cellulose fibers contain various types of irregularities, such as kinks or twists of the microfibrils, or voids such as surface micropores, large pits, and capillaries. Thus, the total surface area of a cellulose fiber {{is much greater than}} the surface area of an ideally smooth <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the same dimension. The net effect of structural heterogeneity within the fiber is that the fibers are at least partially hydrated by water when immersed in aqueous media, and some micropores and capillaries are sufficiently spacious to permit penetration.|$|E
25|$|Attenuation {{in fiber}} optics, {{also known as}} {{transmission}} loss, is the reduction in intensity of the light beam (or signal) as it travels through the transmission medium. Attenuation coefficients in fiber optics usually use units of dB/km through the medium due to the relatively high quality of transparency of modern optical transmission media. The medium is usually a <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> silica glass that confines the incident light beam to the inside. Attenuation {{is an important factor}} limiting the transmission of a digital signal across large distances. Thus, much research has gone into both limiting the attenuation and maximizing the amplification of the optical signal.|$|E

25|$|In 1931, Ford hired chemists Robert Boyer and Frank Calvert {{to produce}} {{artificial}} silk. They {{succeeded in making}} a textile <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> spun soy protein fibers, hardened or tanned in a formaldehyde bath, which was given the name Azlon. It was usable {{in the making of}} suits, felt hats, and overcoats. Though pilot production of Azlon reached 5000pounds per day in 1940, it never reached the commercial market; Dupont's nylon was the winner in the quest to produce artificial silk. In 1932–33, the Ford Motor Company spent approximately $1,250,000 on soybean research. By 1935, every Ford car had soy involved in its manufacture. For example, soybean oil was used to paint the automobiles, as well as fluid for shock absorbers. Ford's involvement with the soybean opened many doors for agriculture and industry to be linked more strongly than ever before.|$|E
25|$|The oases to {{the west}} and north of the range have the easiest access. Where {{mosquitoes}} do not abound, they support several villages, such as Zouar, where indigenous plant species have largely been replaced by some 56,000 date palms (Phoenix dactylifera) for the production of dates. These are harvested between late July and early August. In winter, when reserves are depleted, {{it is not uncommon for}} the cores of the dates and the <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the palms to be ground into a paste and consumed. These palm groves can also grow millet and corn, but the crop is spotty and sometimes swept away by early flooding. The banks of the enneris grow desert gourd (Citrullus colocynthis), which are collected in October to extract the bitter seeds which, after being washed, are ground to make flour. Horticulture is practiced on a small scale using traditional irrigation methods. Goats and, more rarely, sheep number 50,000 heads, and 8,000 camels and 7,000 donkeys are raised in the range. Chickens are also numerous, although the consumption of meat is rare, usually done so through salting.|$|E
25|$|The bharal or blue sheep is {{the most}} {{abundant}} mountain ungulate in the Ladakh region, {{although it is not}} found in some parts of Zangskar and Sham areas. The Asiatic ibex is a very elegant mountain goat that is distributed {{in the western part of}} Ladakh. It is the second most abundant mountain ungulate in the region with a population of about 6000 individuals. It is adapted to rugged areas where it easily climbs when threatened. The Ladakhi Urial is another unique mountain sheep that inhabits the mountains of Ladakh. The population is declining, however, and there are not more than 3000 individuals left in Ladakh. The urial is endemic to Ladakh, where it is distributed only along two major river valleys: the Indus and Shayok. The animal is often persecuted by farmers whose crops are allegedly damaged by it. Its population declined precipitously in the last century due to indiscriminate shooting by hunters along the Leh-Srinagar highway. The Tibetan argali or Nyan is the largest wild sheep in the world, standing 3.5 to 4 feet at the shoulder with the horn measuring 90–100cm. It is distributed on the Tibetan plateau and its marginal mountains encompassing a total area of 2.5 million km2. There is only a small population of about 400 animals in Ladakh. The animal prefers open and rolling terrain as it runs, unlike wild goats that climb into steep cliffs, to escape from predators. The endangered Tibetan antelope, known as chiru in Indian English, or Ladakhi tsos, has traditionally been hunted for its wool (shahtoosh) which is a natural <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> the finest quality and thus valued for its light weight and warmth and as a status symbol. The wool of chiru must be pulled out by hand, a process done after the animal is killed. The fiber is smuggled into Kashmir and woven into exquisite shawls by Kashmiri workers. Ladakh is also home to the Tibetan gazelle, which inhabits the vast rangelands in eastern Ladakh bordering Tibet.|$|E

5000|$|Typically, nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>of</b> {{a larger}} {{diameter}} may be activated by single-pulse stimuli {{of a lower}} intensity, and thus may be recruited more readily. [...] However, DPPs have demonstrated the additional capability to invert this recruitment order. As electrical stimuli have a greater effect over nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>of</b> a larger diameter, DPPs will in turn cause a larger degree of sodium conductance inactivation within such nerve fibers, thus nerve <b>fibers</b> <b>of</b> a smaller diameter will have a lower threshold current.|$|R

500|$|Next, Albert Goldman (then an English {{professor}} at Columbia University) and author and playwright Gore Vidal debated homosexuality, {{with an emphasis}} on the presence of homosexuals in the creative arts. Goldman asserted that homosexuality [...] "is just one of a number of...things all tending toward the subversion, toward the final erosion, of our cultural values." [...] Vidal, asserting that homosexuality is as natural as heterosexuality, countered by saying [...] "The United States is living out some mad Protestant nineteenth-century dream of human behavior....I think the so-called breaking of the moral <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> this country is one of the healthiest things that's begun to happen." ...|$|E

500|$|Michael Flecker, {{the chief}} {{excavating}} archaeologist at the site, compared the wrecked ship to {{three types of}} the same period {{and concluded that the}} wreck most resembled [...] "lashed-lug" [...] ships of south-east Asia—first used in the 5th century. He said that fully stitched boats were found from the African coast, Oman, in the Red Sea, on the Indian coast, {{and as far as the}} Maldives. He notes that Roman references by Procopius in the 6th century tell of boats with planks stitched together in a similar fashion used in [...] "Indian Seas". Though Arabian ships of this type have not been found before, they are mentioned in text including the late-Tang Ling biao lu yi ("Strange Things Noted in the South"). According to John Guy, curator of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the book [...] "describes the ships of foreign merchants as being stitched together with the <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> coir-palms and having their seams caulked rather than using iron nails to secure their planks".|$|E
500|$|Nixon had Agnew {{deliver a}} series of speeches attacking their {{political}} opponents. In New Orleans on October 19, Agnew blamed liberal elites for condoning violence by demonstrators, [...] "a spirit of national masochism prevails, encouraged by an effete corps of impudent snobs who characterize themselves as intellectuals". The following day, in Jackson, Mississippi, Agnew told a Republican dinner, [...] "for too long the South has been the punching bag for those who characterize themselves as liberal intellectuals... their course is a course that will ultimately weaken and erode the very <b>fiber</b> <b>of</b> America." [...] Agnew, though he denied Republicans had a Southern Strategy, stressed that the administration and Southern whites had much in common, including the disapproval of the elites. Levy argued that such remarks were designed to attract Southern whites to the Republican Party to help secure the re-election of Nixon and Agnew in 1972, and that Agnew's rhetoric [...] "could have served as the blueprint for the culture wars of the next twenty-to-thirty years, including the claim that Democrats were soft on crime, unpatriotic, and favored flag burning rather than flag waving". The attendees at the speeches were enthusiastic, but other Republicans, especially from the cities, complained to the Republican National Committee that Agnew's attacks were overbroad.|$|E
