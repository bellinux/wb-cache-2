The unexpected invasion destroyed the unguarded dwelling places of the Magyars, <b>forcing</b> <b>them</b> to leave the Pontic steppes and seek refuge over the Carpathian Mountains. The Magyars occupied their new homeland in several phases, initially settling the lands east of the Danube and only invading the March of Pannonia after Arnulf of East Francia died in 899.
