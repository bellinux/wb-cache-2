5|$|The {{administration}} of the Clinton Laboratories passed from Monsanto to the University of Chicago in May 1947, and then to Union Carbide in December 1947. The Atomic Energy Commission's influential General Advisory Committee, chaired by J. Robert Oppenheimer, recommended that all work on reactors be concentrated at the Argonne National Laboratory, the successor to the Metallurgical Laboratory, near Chicago. There was also competition for staff and resources from the newly established Brookhaven National Laboratory near New York. Morale was low, {{and no one could}} be found to take on the job of <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> at the laboratory, renamed the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in January 1948. At least six people turned down the job before Union Carbide's acting Director, Nelson (Bunny) Rucker, asked Weinberg to become <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> in March 1948.|$|E

His work contributed to the Google Ngram Viewer, released in December 2010, which makes use of culturomics ideas to produce normalized historical trends for any sequence of letters. This project published a number of findings in the journal Science, including the changing dynamic of fame and instances of literary censorship during the Second World War.|$|E
5|$|Chadwick's Clerk-Maxwell studentship {{expired in}} 1923, {{and he was}} succeeded by the Russian {{physicist}} Pyotr Kapitza. The Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research, Sir William McCormick arranged for Chadwick to become Rutherford's assistant <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research.</b> In this role, Chadwick helped Rutherford select PhD students. Over {{the next few years}} these would include John Cockcroft, Norman Feather and Mark Oliphant, who would become firm friends with Chadwick. As many students had no idea what they wanted to research, Rutherford and Chadwick would suggest topics. Chadwick edited all the papers produced by the laboratory.|$|E

5|$|During 1936 the {{experimental}} system at Bawdsey was tested against {{a variety of}} simulated attacks, along with extensive development of interception theory carried out at RAF Biggin Hill. One observer was Hugh Dowding, initially as the <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> for the RAF, and later as the commander of RAF Fighter Command. Dowding noted that the CH stations provided so much information that operators had problems relaying it to the pilots, and the pilots had problems understanding it. He addressed this {{through the creation of}} what is today known as the Dowding system.|$|E
5|$|James E. Boyd was {{promoted}} to Assistant <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> at the station in 1954, and succeeded Calaway as director on July 1, 1957. While at Georgia Tech, Boyd wrote an influential article {{about the role of}} research centers at institutes of technology, which argued that research should be integrated with education, and Boyd correspondingly involved undergraduates in his research. Boyd was known for recruiting faculty capable of both teaching and performing notable research; one such example is his recruitment of noted physicist and nuclear scientist Earl W. McDaniel.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Wales left a study {{track at}} Indiana University as a PhD {{candidate}} {{to work in}} finance before completing his doctoral dissertation. In 1994 Wales was hired by Michael Davis, CEO of finance company Chicago Options Associates, as a trader focusing on futures contracts and options. Wales was adept at determining future movements of foreign currencies and interest rates; he was successful in Chicago, became independently wealthy, and was <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> at Chicago Options Associates from 1994 to 2000.

5|$|After the war, Chadwick {{followed}} Rutherford to the Cavendish Laboratory at the University of Cambridge, where Chadwick {{earned his}} Doctor of Philosophy degree under Rutherford's supervision from Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge, in June 1921. He was Rutherford's assistant <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> at the Cavendish Laboratory {{for over a}} decade {{at a time when it}} was one of the world's foremost centres for the study of physics, attracting students like John Cockcroft, Norman Feather, and Mark Oliphant. Chadwick followed his discovery of the neutron by measuring its mass. He anticipated that neutrons would become a major weapon in the fight against cancer. Chadwick left the Cavendish Laboratory in 1935 to become a professor of physics at the University of Liverpool, where he overhauled an antiquated laboratory and, by installing a cyclotron, made it an important centre for the study of nuclear physics.|$|E

5|$|During 1962 – 63, Bánáthy {{focused his}} research, {{using it as}} the basis of his Master's Thesis at San Jose State University. The Monterey Bay Area Council {{published}} Bánáthy's abbreviated version entitled A Design for Leadership Development in Scouting. Responding to widespread interest, Dr. Tripp gave a talk in 1963 at the Fifty-third Annual Meeting of the National Council of the Boy Scouts of America on Development of Leadership in Boy Leaders of Boys. In August 1963, a patrol of Scouts from the San Mateo County Council and a few boys from the Circle Ten Council in Dallas attended White Stag summer camp at Camp Pico Blanco. The program was observed and evaluated by Ken Wells (national <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research)</b> and John Larson (staff researcher). Wells had a long history with Wood Badge, beginning as a participant in the second United States Wood Badge course in 1948. They were impressed by the program.|$|E
5|$|During {{the first}} three years of the Second World War, Coastal Command and the Admiralty fought a battle with the RAF and Air Ministry over the primacy of trade defence, in {{relation}} to the bomber effort against mainland Germany, a strategic tussle which conceivably could have cost the Western Alliance the Battle of the Atlantic. The Air Staff and Bomber Command enjoyed the backing of Churchill and the maritime air effort struggled to receive the recognition it needed. On the outbreak of war, the order of battle listed just 298 aircraft, of which only 171 were operational. On 15 February 1941, Coastal Command was placed under the operational control of the Admiralty. Instrumental in improving the strike rate against submarines was scientific advisor and assistant <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> E. J. Williams, who applied scientific analysis to the logistical problems to great effect. Williams was present at some meetings of the Cabinet Anti-U-boat Committee at 10 Downing Street, under the chairmanship of the Prime Minister.|$|E

5|$|In 1945, Wigner {{accepted}} {{a position as}} the <b>Director</b> <b>of</b> <b>Research</b> at the Clinton Laboratories in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, which then had a staff of about 800. He took with him his protégés Gale Young, Katherine Way and Weinberg. Weinberg, {{who was the first}} to arrive at Oak Ridge in May 1945, became head of the Physics Division in 1946. But after the Atomic Energy Commission took over responsibility for the laboratory's operations from the Manhattan Project at the start of 1947, Wigner, feeling unsuited to a managerial role in the new environment, left Oak Ridge at the end of summer in 1947 and returned to Princeton University.|$|E
5|$|In December 1942, during World War II, Charles Allen Thomas, {{a chemist}} and <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> at Monsanto in St. Louis, joined the National Defense Research Committee (NDRC) as {{the deputy chief}} of its Division 8, which was {{responsible}} for propellants, explosives and the like. Early in 1943, he traveled to the east with Richard C. Tolman, {{a member of the}} NDRC, and James B. Conant, the president of Harvard University {{and the chairman of the}} NDRC, to witness a demonstration of a new underwater explosive. Conant and Tolman took the opportunity to quietly investigate Thomas' background. He was then invited to a meeting in Washington D.C., with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves, Jr., the director of the wartime Manhattan Project responsible for building an atomic bomb. When he got there, Thomas found Conant was also present.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Julian {{had written}} to the Glidden Company, a {{supplier}} of soybean oil products, to request a five-gallon sample of the oil to use as his {{starting point for the}} synthesis of human steroidal sex hormones (in part because his wife was suffering from infertility). After receiving the request, W. J. O'Brien, a vice-president at Glidden, made a telephone call to Julian, offering him the position of <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> at Glidden's Soya Products Division in Chicago. He was very likely offered the job by O'Brien because he was fluent in German, and Glidden had just purchased a modern continuous countercurrent solvent extraction plant from Germany for the extraction of vegetable oil from soybeans for paints and other uses.|$|E
5|$|From 1944-1947 he was <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> and {{publications}} for The Council of State Governments in Chicago. In 1947 {{he was appointed}} {{professor of political science}} at the Maxwell School of Citizenship and Public Affairs at Syracuse University. In 1952 and 1953 he was part of U.N. sponsored missions in public administration in Colombia, the Philippines, and Japan. His next one-year U.N. appointment was as co-Director of the Public Administration Institute for Turkey and the Middle East in Ankara, Turkey. Indiana University then appointed him director of the Institute of Training for Public Service and Coordinator of Indonesian and Thailand Public Administration Programs. By the time of his retirement, further appointments, research and lecture tours and vacations had enabled him to visit nearly one hundred countries around the world as well as every state in the union. In 1956, after a year as visiting professor of government at the University of California, Berkeley, he returned to Bloomington as Professor of Government at Indiana University, where he remained until his retirement. In the course of his career he secured 21 National Science Foundation grants to support his research.|$|E
5|$|Rotblat {{returned}} to Britain to become senior lecturer and acting <b>director</b> <b>of</b> <b>research</b> in nuclear {{physics at the}} University of Liverpool. Most of his family had survived the war. With {{the help of a}} Polish man, his brother-in-law Mieczysław (Mietek) Pokorny had created false Polish Catholic identities for Rotblat's sister Ewa and niece Halina. Ewa, taking advantage {{of the fact that she}} was an ash blonde who, like Rotblat, spoke fluent Polish as well as Yiddish, smuggled the rest of the family out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Mietek, Rotblat's brother Mordecai (Michael) and Michael's wife Manya, Rotblat's mother Scheindel, and two Russian soldiers lived in a concealed bunker underneath a house near Otwock, in which Ewa and Halina lived with a Polish family. Displays of Polish anti-Semitism that she witnessed during the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising embittered Ewa towards Poland, and she petitioned Rotblat to help the family emigrate to England. He therefore now accepted Chadwick's offer of British citizenship so he could help them escape from Poland. They lived with him in London for some time before becoming established. Halina would go on to graduate from Somerville College, Oxford and University College London, and become an editor of the Dictionary of National Biography.|$|E
