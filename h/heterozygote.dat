5|$|Alternatively, {{selection}} can {{be divided}} according to its effect on genetic diversity. Purifying or negative selection acts to remove genetic variation from the population (and is opposed by de novo mutation, which introduces new variation. In contrast, balancing selection acts to maintain genetic variation in a population, {{even in the absence}} of de novo mutation, by negative frequency-dependent selection. One mechanism for this is <b>heterozygote</b> advantage, where individuals with two different alleles have a selective advantage over individuals with just one allele. The polymorphism at the human ABO blood group locus has been explained in this way.|$|E
5|$|The black morph is {{less common}} than the spotted form but, at about {{six percent of}} the population, it is several orders of {{magnitude}} above the mutation rate. Hence, it is being supported by selection. Some evidence indicates the melanism allele is dominant. The black form may {{be an example of}} <b>heterozygote</b> advantage; breeding in captivity is not yet conclusive on this. Melanistic jaguars (or “black” jaguars) occur primarily in parts of South America, and are virtually unknown in wild populations residing in the subtropical and temperate regions of North America; they have never been documented north of Mexico’s Isthmus of Tehuantepec.|$|E
5|$|Hybrids are not {{as might}} be {{expected}} always intermediate between their parents (as if there were blending inheritance), but are sometimes stronger than either parent variety, a phenomenon called heterosis, hybrid vigour, or <b>heterozygote</b> advantage. This is most common with plant hybrids. A transgressive phenotype is a phenotype that displays more extreme characteristics than either of the parent lines. Plant breeders use several techniques to produce hybrids, including line breeding and the formation of complex hybrids. An economically important example is hybrid maize (corn), which provides a considerable seed yield advantage over open pollinated varieties. Hybrid seed dominates the commercial maize seed market in the United States, Canada and many other major maize-producing countries.|$|E

5|$|Some {{forms of}} {{balancing}} selection do {{not result in}} fixation, but maintain an allele at intermediate frequencies in a population. This can occur in diploid species (with pairs of chromosomes) when heterozygous individuals (with just one copy of the allele) have a higher fitness than homozygous individuals (with two copies). This is called <b>heterozygote</b> advantage or over-dominance, of which the best-known example is the resistance to malaria in humans heterozygous for sickle-cell anaemia. Maintenance of allelic variation can also occur through disruptive or diversifying selection, which favours genotypes that depart from the average in either direction (that is, the opposite of over-dominance), and {{can result in a}} bimodal distribution of trait values. Finally, balancing selection can occur through frequency-dependent selection, where the fitness of one particular phenotype depends on the distribution of other phenotypes in the population. The principles of game theory have been applied to understand the fitness distributions in these situations, particularly in the study of kin selection and the evolution of reciprocal altruism.|$|E
5|$|Speciation {{requires}} {{a degree of}} reproductive isolation—that is, a reduction in gene flow. However, it is intrinsic {{to the concept of}} a species that hybrids are selected against, opposing the evolution of reproductive isolation, a problem that was recognised by Darwin. The problem does not occur in allopatric speciation with geographically separated populations, which can diverge with different sets of mutations. E. B. Poulton realized in 1903 that reproductive isolation could evolve through divergence, if each lineage acquired a different, incompatible allele of the same gene. Selection against the <b>heterozygote</b> would then directly create reproductive isolation, leading to the Bateson–Dobzhansky–Muller model, further elaborated by H. Allen Orr and Sergey Gavrilets. With reinforcement, however, natural selection can favor an increase in pre-zygotic isolation, influencing the process of speciation directly.|$|E
5|$|The LDL {{receptor}} gene {{is located}} on the short arm of chromosome 19 (19p13.1-13.3). It comprises 18 exons and spans 45 kb, and the protein gene product contains 839 amino acids in mature form. A single abnormal copy (<b>heterozygote)</b> of FH causes cardiovascular disease by the age of 50 in about 40% of cases. Having two abnormal copies (homozygote) causes accelerated atherosclerosis in childhood, including its complications. The plasma LDL levels are inversely related to the activity of LDL receptor (LDLR). Homozygotes have LDLR activity of less than 2%, while heterozygotes have defective LDL processing with receptor activity being 2–25%, depending {{on the nature of the}} mutation.

40|$|We {{measured}} propionyl coenzyme A carboxylase (PCC) {{activity in}} extracts of skin fibroblasts and peripheral blood leukocytes from controls and obligate <b>heterozygotes</b> for PCC deficiency. 6 <b>heterozygotes</b> {{were from the}} pcc A complementation group; 12 were from the other major complementation group, designated pcc C. Mean PCC activity in fibroblast extracts from pcc A <b>heterozygotes</b> was 52 % of that in controls, whereas mean PCC activity in pcc C <b>heterozygotes</b> was indistinguishable from that of controls. Similar results were obtained with extracts of peripheral blood leukocytes. In none of eight families (three pcc A and five pcc C) in which PCC activity was studied in both parents of an affected child were significant intrafamilial differences observed. The activities of two other mitochondrial enzymes (β-methyl-crotonyl CoA carboxylase and glutamate dehydrogenase) were comparable in controls and both groups of <b>heterozygotes.</b> Whereas the data from pcc A <b>heterozygotes</b> are consistent with expected gene dosage effects, those from pcc C <b>heterozygotes</b> are not.

40|$|Introduction: We have {{previously}} demonstrated platelet hyperreactivity in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Carriers of one CF mutation (<b>heterozygotes)</b> {{have been shown}} to have abnormalities related to the presence of only one-half the normal amount of CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein. Platelet hyperreactivity in CF <b>heterozygotes</b> would be an important cardiovascular risk factor, since approximately 1 in 25 Caucasians is a CF carrier. Materials and methods: We used highly sensitive assays of platelet activation to assess the difference between 16 CF <b>heterozygotes</b> and 16 age- and sex-matched healthy controls without CF mutations. Results: We found no difference in platelet activation between CF <b>heterozygotes</b> and controls. Conclusions: The 50 % reduction in the CF transmembrane conductance regulator protein in <b>heterozygotes</b> is insufficient to cause platelet activation...|$|R
5|$|The {{existence}} of discrete inheritable units was first suggested by Gregor Mendel (1822–1884). From 1857 to 1864, in Brno (Czech Republic), he studied inheritance patterns in 8000 common edible pea plants, tracking distinct traits from parent to offspring. He described these mathematically as 2ncombinations where n {{is the number}} of differing characteristics in the original peas. Although he did not use the term gene, he explained his results in terms of discrete inherited units that give rise to observable physical characteristics. This description prefigured Wilhelm Johannsen's distinction between genotype (the genetic material of an organism) and phenotype (the visible traits of that organism). Mendel was also the first to demonstrate independent assortment, the distinction between dominant and recessive traits, the distinction between a <b>heterozygote</b> and homozygote, and the phenomenon of discontinuous inheritance.|$|E
25|$|Such {{a balance}} is seen more simply in sickle-cell anaemia, which is found mostly in {{tropical}} populations in Africa and India. An individual homozygous for the recessive sickle hemoglobin, HgbS, has a short expectancy of life, whereas {{the life expectancy}} of the standard hemoglobin (HgbA) homozygote and also the <b>heterozygote</b> is normal (though <b>heterozygote</b> individuals will suffer periodic problems). The sickle-cell variant survives in the population because the <b>heterozygote</b> is resistant to malaria and the malarial parasite kills {{a huge number of}} people each year. This is balancing selection or genetic polymorphism, balanced between fierce selection against homozygous sickle-cell sufferers, and selection against the standard HgbA homozygotes by malaria. The <b>heterozygote</b> has a permanent advantage (a higher fitness) so long as malaria exists; and it has existed as a human parasite for a long time. Because the <b>heterozygote</b> survives, so does the HgbS allele survive at a rate much higher than the mutation rate (see and refs in Sickle-cell disease).|$|E
25|$|MHC allelic {{diversity}} {{has challenged}} evolutionary biologists for explanation.

40|$|To {{explain the}} very high {{frequency}} of cystic fibrosis (CF) mutations in most populations of European descent, it has been proposed that CF <b>heterozygotes</b> have a survival advantage when infected with Vibrio cholerae or Escherichia coli, the toxins of which induce diarrhea by stimulation of active intestinal chloride secretion. Two assumptions underlie this hypothesis: (1) chloride conductance by the CF transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) is the rate-limiting step for active intestinal chloride secretion {{at all levels of}} expression, from approximately zero in patients with CF to normal levels in people who are not carriers of a mutation; and (2) <b>heterozygotes</b> have smaller amounts of functional intestinal CFTR than do people who are not carriers, and <b>heterozygotes</b> therefore secrete less chloride when exposed to secretagogues. The authors used an intestinal perfusion technique to measure in vivo basal and prostaglandin-stimulated jejunal chloride secretion in normal subjects, CF <b>heterozygotes,</b> and patients with CF. Patients with CF had essentially no active chloride secretion in the basal state, and secretion was not stimulated by a prostaglandin analogue. However, CF <b>heterozygotes</b> secreted chloride {{at the same rate as}} did people without a CF mutation. If <b>heterozygotes</b> are assumed to have less-than-normal intestinal CFTR function, these results mean that CFTR expression is not rate limiting for active chloride secretion in <b>heterozygotes.</b> The results do not support the theory that {{the very high}} frequency of CF mutations is due to a survival advantage that is conferred on <b>heterozygotes</b> who contract diarrheal illnesses mediated by intestinal hypersecretion of chloride...|$|R

40|$|The {{genetic control}} of {{pigmentation}} was analyzed using five unlinked mutants, namely, c, pk, Bl, ey and I. Each mutant blocks or reduces pigmentation. Chick melanocyte cultures of each mutant type were fused to produce all ten possible pair combinations of nondividing heterokaryons. Heterokaryons were identified autoradiographically. (One partner in each pair was labeled with 3 H-thymidine.) Crosses produced comparable pairs of double <b>heterozygotes</b> that were analyzed in vivo and in vitro. Heterokaryon pairs {{were compared to}} their corresponding double <b>heterozygotes.</b> —Some combinations showed complementation and produced wild-type pigment. Others showed noncomplementation having little or no pigment. Double <b>heterozygotes</b> complemented each other except in the cases involving the dominant mutant, I. Four heterokaryon pairs gave different results from their corresponding double <b>heterozygotes.</b> The pk-Bl and pk-ey combinations failed to complement as heterokaryons but did complement as double <b>heterozygotes.</b> On the other hand, the I-c and I-Bl combinations complemented as heterokaryons but not as double <b>heterozygotes.</b> Based on these differences it is hypothesized that the pk and I loci are nuclearly restricted regulatory elements. Examples in the literature from other systems are cited to support such a hypothesis...|$|R
40|$|Viability {{relative}} to Cy/Pm {{as a standard}} was studied in Drosophila melanogaster. One experiment, E 1, consisted of progeny from eleven distinct 7 x 7 factorial mating designs with reciprocals for second chromosomes extracted from a natural population. The other experiment, E 2, consisted of two distinct sets of <b>heterozygotes</b> with reciprocals and corresponding homozygotes. It was established from E 1 that there are little to no synergistic effects among different genotypes in a vial and that Cy and Pm <b>heterozygotes</b> vary {{almost as much as}} would be expected if one chromosome were held constant for wild-type <b>heterozygotes.</b> In wild-type <b>heterozygotes,</b> variances were estimated to be 0. 0099 for average chromosomal effects, 0. 0054 for interactions of chromosomes, 0. 0021 for maternal effects, 0. 0079 for paternal effects, and - 0. 0010 for the remaining interaction effects, all being significantly different from zero except the last. The variances of Cy and Pm <b>heterozygotes,</b> covariance of Cy and Pm <b>heterozygotes,</b> and covariances of Cy and Pm <b>heterozygotes</b> with wild-type <b>heterozygotes,</b> as well as the comparable statistics available in E 2, all showed a large paternal component of variance and a smaller maternal component of variance, both unexpected results. —From E 2 the variance of homozygotes, excluding error variance, was estimated to be 0. 0149, and the covariances of homozygotes with wild-type <b>heterozygotes</b> to be 0. 0056 for maternally derived chromosomes common and 0. 0126 for paternally derived chromosomes common, again showing the larger paternal than maternal influence. The average genetic regression of <b>heterozygotes</b> on homozygotes of 0. 61 was reduced only slightly to 0. 56 by correcting for maternal and paternal variances. These genetic regressions, generally utilized as estimators of the average degree of dominance, are larger than any previously reported. —Differential meiotic drive in Cy and Pm parents was shown to be compatible with the large paternal and maternal variances, but other causes cannot be ruled out. —Approximations were developed for translating various variances, covariances, and regressions between single- and double-marker experiments, assuming that marker chromosomes behave as typical wild-type chromosomes in one case and assuming a (partially) recessive model with the population in mutation selection balance in another case.

40|$|We {{present the}} results of a cyanide-nitroprusside test (CNT) after a {{standardized}} dilution procedure of urine samples and report the efficiency of this method in detecting <b>heterozygotes</b> for cystinuria when applied on an open pediatric population. In the preliminary study we assayed by quantitative determination of amino acids 162 urine samples from a hospital population identifying 24 type III <b>heterozygotes</b> and 2 type II <b>heterozygotes</b> for cystinuria. The classic CNT gave 38 false positive results and 5 false negative results showing a sensitivity and specificity of 0. 808 and 0. 721, respectively. When progressively diluted, all samples of <b>heterozygotes</b> remained CNT positive up to a creatinine concentration of 90 mg/dl. At this level of dilution 31 out of 38 false positive turned to negative, thus obtaining a specificity of 0. 922 without a lowering of the sensitivity in detecting <b>heterozygotes.</b> The standardized dilution at 90 mg/dl of creatinine concentration was applied to 74. 7 % of a population of 1024 schoolchildren. In this way 163 out of 210 positive results were eliminated and thus the specificity of CNT rose from 0. 789 to 0. 953.

An HFE-genotype stratified random sample of 1, 438 subjects, followed {{for an average of}} 12 years to a mean age of 65 years, completed questionnaires and gave blood. Clinical examinations were blinded to HFE genotype. A total of 180 (84 males) clinically examined C 282 Y/H 63 D participants were compared with 330 (149 males) controls with neither HFE mutation; 132 (65 males) and 270 (122 males), respectively, had serum iron measures at both timepoints. Mean serum ferritin (SF) and transferrin saturation (TS) were significantly greater for male and female compound <b>heterozygotes</b> than for wild-types at baseline and follow-up (all P < 0. 02) except for females who were premenopausal at baseline, where SF was similar in both genotype groups. For subjects with serum measures from both baseline and follow-up, mean SF and TS levels did not change significantly for men or for postmenopausal women, but for premenopausal women SF levels increased from 43 to 109 μg/L for compound <b>heterozygotes</b> and from 35 to 64 μg/L for wild-types (both P < 0. 001). Male and female compound <b>heterozygotes</b> had a similar prevalence of hemochromatosis-related morbidity to wild-types. One of 82 males and zero of 95 females had documented iron overload-related disease. Conclusion: For male compound <b>heterozygotes,</b> mean iron indices do not change during middle age but for female compound <b>heterozygotes</b> menopause results in increased mean SF.
