The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> one of the four legislative committees: Budget and Taxation; Education, Health, and Environmental Affairs (listed in this table as Education, Health, and Environment); Finance; or Judicial Proceedings.

5|$|The Silver Line has {{two primary}} goals. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> link Washington, D.C. by rail to Washington Dulles International Airport and the edge cities of Tysons Corner, Reston, Herndon, and Ashburn. The second is to spur urban {{development}} in Tysons Corner and reduce overall reliance on highway {{traffic in the}} business district, Virginia's largest and the 12th-largest in the country. The district's area is comparable in size to downtown Washington, D.C., but is rather insulated from its surrounding neighborhoods and has no existing grid pattern in its streets. The Silver Line would also improve public access to the Udvar-Hazy Center, an annex of National Air and Space Museum located near Dulles Airport; Virginia Regional Transit currently runs a shuttle bus {{from the airport to}} Udvar-Hazy.|$|E
5|$|The {{story was}} {{conceived}} around a protagonist whose abilities {{can not be}} measured through standardized evaluation; as such, he is mistakenly categorized as a poor performing student or an irregular. This premise served as a basis for the character, Tatsuya Shiba. Satō has two processes for scripting the story arcs: the <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> create scenarios to have characters behave and interact in certain ways; the second is to plan a scene, then script the story so it leads to that scene. Satō professed that he does not feel his characters are alive or have a will of their own when scripting them.|$|E

25|$|Skin {{friction}} {{is caused}} by viscous drag in the boundary layer around the object.

25|$|There are {{two basic}} ways to reduce random error in an {{epidemiological}} study. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> increase the sample size of the study.

25|$|The {{scanning}} tunneling microscope {{can remove}} SAM molecules in many different ways. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> remove them mechanically by dragging the tip across the substrate surface. This {{is not the most}} desired technique as these tips are expensive and dragging them causes a lot of wear and reduction of the tip quality. The second way is to degrade or desorb the SAM molecules by shooting them with an electron beam. The {{scanning tunneling microscope}} can also remove SAMs by field desorption and field enhanced surface diffusion.|$|E
25|$|A common {{error is}} {{to attempt to}} use a delete {{expression}} to delete the object. This results in the wrong operator delete function being called. Dewhurst recommends two strategies for avoiding this error. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> ensure that any custom allocators rely upon the Standard C++ library's global, non-placement, operator new, and are thus nothing more than simple wrappers around the C++ library's memory management. The second is to create new and delete functions for individual classes, and customize memory management via class function members rather than by using the placement syntax.|$|E
25|$|Mexican artesanía is sold {{to foreigners}} in two ways. The <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> tourists, as Mexican {{handmade}} items {{is part of}} what makes the country attractive to foreign visitors. The second is through exports. Mexican artesanía is widely sold outside of Mexico, especially through the Internet. However, there is no single marketing entity or corporation whose business is to export Mexican artesanía in general. Exporting is mostly done by investments in a particular crafts by particular people, rather than a large scale promotion of Mexican crafts in general.|$|E

25|$|The {{foraging}} {{activities of}} Vespula vulgaris are generally highest in early mornings. There are three known reasons for such behavior. <b>First</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> satisfy the larval requirements. The workers fly off {{early in the}} morning to forage, as soon as their optimal light intensity is reached. They want to feed the larvae which have been starving during the night as soon as possible to reduce their chance of dying. The second reason is to maximize fluid foraging. Because dews and nectars are most abundant {{early in the morning}} and are the best sources of fluids, the workers fly off early in the morning before the competition becomes severe. Last is the necessity to release excretory products such as trophallactic secretions from the larvae.|$|E

25|$|Power to gas is a {{technology}} which converts electrical {{power to a}} gas fuel. There are 2 methods, the <b>first</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> use the electricity for water splitting and inject the resulting hydrogen into the natural gas grid. The second (less efficient) method is used to convert carbon dioxide and water to methane, (see natural gas) using electrolysis and the Sabatier reaction. The excess power or off peak power generated by wind generators or solar arrays is then used for load balancing in the energy grid. Using the existing natural gas system for hydrogen Fuel cell maker Hydrogenics and natural gas distributor Enbridge have teamed up to develop such a power to gas system in Canada.|$|E
