The {{first part of the}} work deals with an application of a standard method for the <b>knock</b> <b>rating</b> of gaseous fuels. The Service Methane Number (SMN) is compared with the standard Methane Number (MN) calculated from the standard AVL software METHANE (which corresponds to the MN measured on a Cooperative Fuel Research engine). Then, in the second part, the 'mechanical' resistance to knock of our engine is highlighted by means of the Methane Number Requirement (MNR). A single cylinder LISTER PETTER engine was modified to run as a spark ignition engine with a fixed compression ratio and an adjustable spark advance. Effects of engine settings on the MNR are deduced from experimental data and compared extensively with previous studies. Using the above, it is then possible to adapt the engine settings for optimal knock control and performances. The error on the SMN and MNR stands beneath ± 2 MN units over the gases and engine settings considered...|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} properties of aviation fuels for spark-ignition engines is their <b>knock</b> <b>rating.</b> The CFR engine tests of fuels of 87 octane and above does not always correspond entirely to the actual behavior of these fuels in the airplane engine. A method is therefore developed which, in contrast to the octane number determination, permits a testing of the fuel under various temperatures and fuel mixture conditions. The following reference fuels were employed: 1) Primary fuels; isooctane and n-heptane; 2) Secondary fuels; pure benzene and synthetic benzine...|$|E
40|$|The author believes, on {{the basis}} of {{experimental}} ignition-lag data, that the character of a fuel cannot be stated in terms of a single constant (such as octane or cetane number) but that at least two and generally three constants are required. Thus no correlation between knock ratings can be expected if in one set of tests the charge temperature was varied while in the other the charge pressure was varied. For this reason, he favors <b>knock</b> <b>rating</b> being based on an equation characterizing the ignition lag of the fuel as a function of pressure and temperature of the charge...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the effect of various {{compounds}} on the oxidation of butane was proposed to see if any correlation could be found between the thermal behavior of such reactions and the effect of the same compounds when added to fuel used in an octane rating engine. Fuels for internal combustion engines differ markedly {{in the way in which}} they burn within the cylinder. Some burn in such a manner that the engine operates smoothly; others cause what is generally known as knocking. Although a great amount of work has been done investigating this matter and many theories proposed, the exact cause of the knocking is unknown. The work done has been largely of two types: (1) use of <b>knock</b> <b>rating</b> engines and (2) studies of the oxidation of hydrocarbons.

40|$|Market {{demand for}} high {{performance}} gasoline vehicles and increasingly strict government emissions regulations are driving {{the development of}} highly downsized, boosted direct injection engines. The in-cylinder temperatures and pressures of these emerging technologies tend to no longer adhere to the test conditions defining the RON and MON octane rating scales. This divergence between fuel <b>knock</b> <b>rating</b> methods and fuel performance in modern engines has previously {{led to the development}} of an engine and operating condition dependent scaling factor, K, which allows for extrapolation of RON and MON values. Downsized, boosted DISI engines have been generally shown to have negative K-values when knock limited, indicating a preference for fuels of higher sensitivity and challenging the relevance of a lower limit to the MON specification. The Ultraboost engine is an inline- 4 downsized, highly boosted prototype DISI engine designed to achieve a 35 % reduction in CO 2 emissions whilst maintaining performance of a production V 8. A series of 14 fuel formulations were tested to probe engine response to various fuel properties. This paper presents results from a 7 fuel RON and MON decorrelated matrix at four high-load engine conditions. The K-value was found to be negative at all engine conditions; fuels of higher sensitivity were found to yield improved engine performance. Furthermore, in-cylinder experimental data from high load knocking conditions with a single standard octane fuel were used to simulate the K-value; a similar trend between theory and experiment was observe...|$|E

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{was conducted to}} compare the knock-limited performance of a 20 -percent triptane blend in 28 -K fuel with that of 28 -R and 33 -R fuels at high engine speeds, cruising speeds, and two compression ratios in an K- 1830 - 94 multicylinder engine, Data were obtained with the standard compression ratio of 6. 7 and with a compression ratio of 3. 0, The three fuels were investigated at engine speeds of 1800, 2250, 2600, and 2800 rpm at high and low blower ratios. A carburetor-air temperature of approximate 1 y 100 deg F was maintained for the multicylinder-engine runs, Data were obtained on a single R- 1830 - 94 cylinder engine {{as a means of}} checking the multicylinder data at the higher speeds. A satisfactory correlation between average mixture temperature and knock-limited manifold pressure was obtained by plotting knock-limited manifold pressure against average mixture temperature for the whole range of engine speeds at constant carburetor air temperature and cylinder-head temperature. The single-cylinder knock-limited performance based on charge-air flow matched that of the multicylinder engine within 6 percent under all the conditions except for 28 -R fuel at 2800 rpm; these curves differed from each other by 11 percent in the rich region. The <b>knock</b> <b>rating</b> of 33 -R fuel was found to be a little higher than that of the 20 -percent triptane blend and 26 -R fuel at high mixture temperatures (above 210 deg F) and lean mixtures. The 33 -R fuel exhibited rich knock limits appreciably lower than the 20 -percent triptane blend, Increasing the compression ratio from 6. 7 to 8. 0 lowered the knock-limited manifold pressure for all fuels approximately 15 to 18 inches of mercury absolute in the cruising range and 20 to 28 inches of mercury absolute at higher engine speeds.

40|$|One way {{to extend}} the lean-burn limit of a natural gas engine is by {{addition}} of hydrogen to the primary fuel. This paper presents measurements made on a one-cylinder, 1. 6 - liter natural gas engine. Two combustion chambers, one slow and one fast burning, were tested with various amounts of hydrogen (0, 5, 10 and 15 %-vol) added to natural gas. Three operating points were investigated for each combustion chamber and each hydrogen content level; idle, part load (5 bar IMEP) and 13 bar IMEP (simulated turbocharging). Air/fuel ratio was varied between stoichiometric and the lean limit. For each operating point, a range of ignition timings were tested to find maximum brake torque (MBT) and/or <b>knock.</b> Heat-release <b>rate</b> calculations were made {{in order to assess}} the influence of hydrogen addition on burn rate.

30|$|The {{frequency}} of neuroimaging or incidence of abnormality on neuroimaging in this cohort of athletes that competed in Calgary from January 2010 to December 2016 {{is not possible}} to extrapolate. This occurred because the baseline number of athletes that required any neuroimaging (as an example, imaging in the post bout period) could not be determined from CCSC records over the entire study period (records were only maintained for 1  year period before destruction prior to 2014). What can be inferred is that 780 athletes competed over the 7 -year study period, and 5 were identified with abnormal neuroimaging that lead to an indefinite suspension in the pre-bout period. Apart from the lacunar infarct finding (Athlete 22 in Table 1 was also a poorly controlled hypertensive patient despite medication, along with electrocardiogram abnormalities), each of the other neuroimaging abnormalities is in keeping with a traumatic head mechanism of injury [28 – 30]. More specifically, there is emerging evidence from MMA and boxing literature suggesting that the microstructural changes observed on these investigations could be related to previously sustained training or competition head trauma [31, 32] and potentially correlate with chronic traumatic encephaolopathy [33]. This is especially concerning as Hutchinson et al. reported a <b>knock</b> out <b>rate</b> of 6.4 per 100 athlete-exposures for MMA athletes, and those who were knocked out on average sustain 2.6 head strikes after they have lost consciousness prior to referee intervention [8].|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe engine {{performance}} is generally governed by various parameters like peak pressure, static temperature, heat release <b>rate,</b> <b>knocks</b> emission, etc. However, these parameters are intern influenced significantly by varying the swirl ratio, split injection and the piston bowl configurations. Split injection {{is one of}} the most powerful tools that decrease soot and Nox emission. A better understanding of in-cylinder fluid motion during induction process could improve the combustion process and burning rates of compression ignition engines. Hence, this investigation aimed to develop a numerical model for in-cylinder fluid motion to study the effect of variation of swirl ratio, split injection, injection timing and piston bowl geometries on the {{engine performance}} characteristics. The model was developed in computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, ANSYS FLUENT. The simulations were conducted for the combinations of swirl ratio, three split injection, injection timings and four piston bowl geometries. The simulation results revealed that, the split injection and injection timings and adopting suitable combination of combustion chamber configuration would greatly enhance the engine performance, besides reducing emission level to a greater extent...|$|R

In this review, the bioethanol production techniques from different lignocellulosic biomass, and its potential ethanol yield are studied. Moreover, this paper has reviewed the effects of bioethanol fuel blends on spark ignition engine combustion characteristics (i. e. cylinder pressure, cylinder temperature, flame speed, combustion efficiency, combustion duration, heat release <b>rate,</b> <b>knocking</b> and cold start); engine performance parameters (i. e. torque, brake power, brake specific fuel consumption, brake mean effective pressure, brake thermal efficiency and volumetric efficiency); and emission characteristics (i. e. carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, carbon dioxide, unburned hydrocarbon and other unregulated emissions). Recently, many researchers produced bioethanol from herbaceous, industrial and municipal solid wastes (MSW) instead of agriculture and woody biomass. Most of the engine test results showed a remarkable improvement in engine performance and enhanced combustion characteristics for bioethanol fuel. In addition, the carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbon emissions decreased. Conversely, carbon dioxide and oxides of nitrogen emissions were not significantly reduced. Furthermore, there was no significant reduction of unregulated emissions, such as aromatics, acetaldehyde, and carbonyls...|$|R

However, the possible interactions between ΦC 31 integrase and cellular proteins have never been investigated. Using pLexA-ΦC 31 integrase as bait, we screened a pB 42 AD-human fetal brain cDNA library for potential interacting cellular proteins. Among 61 positives isolated from 106 independent clones, 51 contained DAXX C-terminal fragments. The strong interaction between DAXX and ΦC 31 was further confirmed by co-immunoprecipitation. Deletion analysis revealed that the fas-binding domain of DAXX is also the region for ΦC 31 binding. Hybridization between a ΦC 31 integrase peptide array and an HEK 293 cell extract revealed that a tetramer, 451 RFGK 454, in the C-terminus of ΦC 31 is responsible for the interaction with DAXX. This tetramer is also necessary for ΦC 31 integrase activity as removal of this tetramer resulted in a complete loss of integrase activity.
