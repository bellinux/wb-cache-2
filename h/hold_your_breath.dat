25|$|Mr. Vampire is a 1985 Hong Kong comedy horror film {{directed}} by Ricky Lau in his directorial debut, and also produced by Sammo Hung. The film's {{box office success}} {{led to the creation}} of a Mr. Vampire franchise, with the release of four sequels {{directed by}} Ricky Lau from 1986 to 1992, and subsequent similarly themed films with different directors released between 1987 and 1991. The vampire of the film is based on the jiangshi, the hopping corpses of Chinese folklore. The film was released under the Chinese title 暫時停止呼吸 (literally: <b>Hold</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Breath</b> for a Moment) in Taiwan. The film was the breakthrough success of the jiangshi genre, a trend popular in Hong Kong during the 1980s, and established many of the genre's recognisable tropes.|$|E
500|$|In an {{interview}} with Entertainment Weekly, Ian McShane {{was asked about the}} process of shooting his final scene where he is shown hanging after being killed by the Brotherhood, with McShane saying that the filming of the scene was [...] "very easy. You just have to <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> for 10 seconds and look sufficiently dead for them to get it." [...] He also noted in the interview, [...] "Rory was a delight to work with, and so was the director. The whole experience was five days in Belfast, and I enjoyed it a lot." [...] Prior to the season, in August 2015, reports emerged about the spotting of Rory McCann at a hotel frequented by actors during filming of the series, in Belfast. McCann, whose character is frequently shown chopping wood in the episode, previously spoke in interviews about his prior career with chopping down trees, revealing [...] "I was a lumberjack for years, [...] and I even trained myself to be a tree surgeon." ...|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Melinda Newman of HitFix {{said it was}} [...] "a bit snoozy", however complemented Twain's reasonably strong vocals. Newman added, [...] "She’s not pushing or belting in any way, but she’s upfront and center. However, her delivery is hardly the peppy rallying call that the lyrics call for and if a song ever demanded to be uptempo, this would be it." [...] Sean Daly of the St. Petersburg Times called the song [...] "a shocking stinkeroo every which way." [...] Daly criticized Twain's vocal delivery, noting she sounded as though she sang through {{the side of her}} mouth much like James Cagney, and said the track reinforced the skeptics who insisted Lange was the reason for Twain's success. He concluded, [...] "If 'Today Is Your Day' is a sign of things to come, you might want to <b>hold</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath</b> on that comeback." [...] Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV was disappointed with [...] "Today Is Your Day", but said she would [...] "take it" [...] following the singer's long absence from music. Rubenstein commented that the song was undoubtedly saccharine, yet Twain's lush and rich voice prevailed.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} {{properly}} use an inhaler without a spacer, {{one has to}} coordinate {{a certain number of}} actions in a set order (pressing down on the inhaler, breathing in deeply as soon as the medication is released, <b>holding</b> <b>your</b> <b>breath,</b> exhaling), and not all patients are able to master this sequence. Use of a spacer avoids such timing issues. Spacers slow down the speed of the aerosol coming from the inhaler, meaning that less of the asthma drug impacts {{on the back of the}} mouth and somewhat more may get into the lungs. Because of this, less medication is needed for an effective dose to reach the lungs, and there are fewer side effects from corticosteroid residue in the mouth.|$|R
