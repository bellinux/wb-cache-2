5|$|In {{the ancient}} Olympic Games, {{as well as}} the other Panhellenic Games, there were both four-horse (tethrippon, Greek: τέθριππον) and two-horse (synoris, Greek: συνωρὶς) chariot races, which were <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> aside from the number of horses.|$|E
5|$|T1E2 – This variant was <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the T1E1 {{except the}} Bendix mount was {{replaced}} with the M33 Maxson mount. After the M33 {{was replaced with}} the M45 Quadmount it was accepted as the M16 Half-track.|$|E

5|$|The {{surnames}} Stewart and Stuart denote <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> occupation {{but have}} a completely different word derivation. They originate from the pre-7th-century English words stigweard—a compound of stig meaning household—and weard, a guardian.|$|E
5|$|Installing such a {{large engine}} in a {{relatively}} small vehicle required some modifications, although the exterior sheet metal remained <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the Alpine's. Necessary chassis modifications included moving from the Burman recirculating ball steering mechanism to a more modern rack and pinion system.|$|E
5|$|The 4-manual Ernest M. Skinner {{pipe organ}} has 2,939pipes and remains <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> today as {{when it was}} {{installed}} in 1931 and tonally finished by G. Donald Harrison, as Skinner's opus 839. The organ underwent a complete restoration between 2002–2005, with all original 45ranks of the instrument fully preserved. A 99-memory level Capture System {{was added to the}} organ in 2005.|$|E

5|$|The {{doctrine}} of the Pentecostal Holiness Church is articulated in the Apostles' Creed and the Articles of Faith. The Articles were placed in their present form in 1945. The first four articles are <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as the first four Articles of Religion of the Methodist Church.|$|E
5|$|The {{social and}} {{economic}} problems created by the disaster were overwhelming. Evacuation from London and resettlement elsewhere were strongly encouraged by Charles II, who feared a London rebellion amongst the dispossessed refugees. Despite numerous radical proposals, London was reconstructed on <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> street plan used before the fire.|$|E
5|$|With Floyd's arrival to take {{command of}} Fort Donelson, Pillow took over leading the Confederate left. Feeling overwhelmed, Floyd left {{most of the}} actual command to Pillow and Buckner. At {{the end of the}} day, there had been several skirmishes, but the {{positions}} of each side were <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same.</b> The night progressed with both sides fighting the cold weather.|$|E

5|$|An unusual {{element is}} that the tale draws its {{characters}} from <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> cast as Táin Bó Cuailnge, making mention of some thirty heroes from that narrative, yet never once mentions Cú Chulainn. Chadwick suggests this is probably {{an indication of the}} antiquity of the tradition of the story's tradition, predating the development of Cú Chulainn's story within the Ulster Cycle. Some of the rhetorical verse elements are old and obscure, but certain seemingly parodic elements of the genre at least suggest a later composition of the present form.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment is <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> on all sides. Light always falls from above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Pacific War in August 1945, SWPA was {{dissolved}} and the Air Board again assumed {{full control}} of all its operational formations. Nos.1 and 2(Training) Groups, and No.5 (Maintenance) Group, were disbanded between January and March 1946. Northern Command, having been re-designated Northern Area in December 1945, was disbanded in February 1947. The other area commands continued to function with <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> boundaries as during the war, except that North-Western Area no longer covered the Dutch East Indies.|$|E

5|$|In some units the {{alternator}} is <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as {{that used}} in portable generating sets used to supply mains power, modified {{to produce a}} higher current at a lower voltage but still at the 50 or 60Hz grid frequency. In higher-quality units an alternator with more poles is used and supplies current at a higher frequency, such as 400Hz. The smaller amount of time the high-frequency waveform spends near zero makes {{it much easier to}} strike and maintain a stable arc than with the cheaper grid-frequency sets or grid-frequency mains-powered units.|$|E
5|$|Jenna {{mentions}} that she met Jayden 20 years ago. The scene then flashes back to Jenna getting dissed {{by a young}} Jayden. The costume she is wearing is <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> costume that Jane Krakowski wore 20 years previously in the Broadway musical Starlight Express. In addition, Jayden is dressed similar to the street urchin Gavroche in Les Misérables because the young boy playing that role on Broadway was also providing the voice of Control in Starlight.|$|E
5|$|Tecmo {{published}} {{two versions}} of Ninja Gaiden: Ninja Gaiden Black for Xbox and Ninja Gaiden Sigma for PS3. <b>Essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> game as the original, they tell the same story of Ryu and the Dark Dragon Blade, but include additional content and updated game mechanics. Itagaki deemed Black {{to be the final}} version of Ninja Gaiden, but with the release of the PS3, Tecmo ported the game to this platform as Sigma.|$|E

5|$|The Rivington Street {{building}} was constructed as a Protestant church around 1860 by the Second Reformed Presbyterian Church, which served the area's large German immigrant community. In November 1864 the {{building was}} sold to the Orthodox German-Jewish Congregation Shaaray Hashomayim ("Gates of the Heavens"), which had been founded in 1841. Though its Hebrew name was <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> as that used by the First Roumanian-American congregation—Congregation Shaarey Shamoyim—which later purchased the building in 1902, the two congregations were unrelated.|$|E
5|$|The basic {{equipment}} of a 4th-century foot soldier was <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> {{as in the}} 2nd century: metal armour cuirass, metal helmet, shield and sword. Some evolution {{took place during the}} 3rd century. Trends included the adoption of warmer clothing; the disappearance of distinctive legionary armour and weapons; the adoption by the infantry of equipment used by the cavalry in the earlier period; and the greater use of heavily armoured cavalry called cataphracts.|$|E
5|$|The concerto is {{innovative}} in many respects. In {{the first}} movement alone, Mendelssohn departs from the typical {{form of a}} Classical concerto in many ways, the most immediate being the entry of the soloist almost from the outset, which also occurs in his First Piano Concerto. Although the first movement is mostly in the conventional sonata form, Mendelssohn has the first theme played by the solo violin {{and then by the}} orchestra. Classical concertos typically opened with an orchestral introduction followed by a version of <b>essentially</b> <b>the</b> <b>same</b> material that incorporates the soloist.|$|E
