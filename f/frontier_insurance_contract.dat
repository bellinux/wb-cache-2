40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} phase II of IFRS 4 <b>Insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> The {{aim of the}} {{standard}} is to establish the principles that an entity should apply to report useful information to users of its financial statements about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of cash flows from <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts,</b> so that the financial statements of the entity are comparable with financial statements of other entities. Therefore IASB introduced building blocks measurement model, where an <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> is measured based on {{the present value of}} expected fulfillment cash flows, risk margin and contractual service margin. The building blocks model is based on making extensive judgments when measuring the <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> To explain the judgments, the standard requires the entity to disclose details about the judgments in the footnotes to the financial statements. The building blocks model is used mainly for life <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> For contracts that last one year or less (usually non-life <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts)</b> the standard allows the entities to use a simplified approach for measuring <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> that is similar as the current practice of measuring non-life <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts.</b> Revenues from <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> should depict the transfer of promised services arising from the <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those services (this approach is in line with the prepared IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers) ...|$|R

The existence of other <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> is not the matter that should be disclosed to insurer per se, in Korean insurance law. But when <b>insurance</b> <b>contracts</b> are so accumulated that one have reason to doubt the insured``s moral hazard, then other <b>insurance</b> <b>contract</b> should be disclosed to insurer.
