Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. <b>Jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> opponent's character will make them lose one star, while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in Super Mario 64 DS have returned and now offer multiplayer options for added replay value. The minigames are divided into the categories Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. New Super Mario Bros. contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players.|$|E

The SEALs fired four shots at bin Laden; the first missed, the second grazed Amal in the calf also missing bin Laden, and the final two hit bin Laden in the chest and head, killing him instantly. In Pfarrer's account, the total time elapsed from <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> roof to Osama bin Laden's death was between 30 and 90 seconds.|$|E

Cal was able to block a field goal attempt by Arizona State, but was penalized for <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> line, resulting in a first down. This set up the Sun Devils' final score of the game on an 8-yard run by Keegan Herring. The Bears defense was able to shut out the Sun Devils in the fourth quarter, intercepting Carpenter {{for a second time}} and forcing a fumble that forced them to punt. A Sun Devils field goal attempt in the final minute of the quarter missed. Cal only made one first down in the fourth quarter and {{spent the rest of the}} time successfully running out the clock.|$|E
25|$|According to Pindar, the {{decision}} was made by secret ballot among the Achaeans. In all story versions, the arms were awarded to Odysseus. Driven mad with grief, Ajax desired to kill his comrades, but Athena caused him to mistake the cattle and their herdsmen for the Achaean warriors. In his frenzy he scourged two rams, believing them to be Agamemnon and Menelaus. In the morning, he came to his senses and killed himself by <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> sword that had been given to him by Hector, so that it pierced his armpit, his only vulnerable part. According to an older tradition, he was killed by the Trojans who, seeing he was invulnerable, attacked him with clay until he was covered by it and could no longer move, thus dying of starvation.|$|E

25|$|The {{effects of}} <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hind legs can include {{injuries}} to the proximal, medial, or lateral {{branches of the}} suspensory ligaments. Jumping horses can also be at {{a higher risk of}} developing osteochondritis dissecans (OCD) or other arthritic conditions, even at a young age. Genetic and environmental components play roles in the development of OCD in horses: some families have weaker joints, but excessive growth over a short period of time, age-inappropriate exercise regimens and nutrition can also contribute. Jumping performance is especially influenced by the presence of arthropathic hocks. One study found that at breeding stock evaluations, horses with radiographically diagnosed athropathies of the hock joints scored significantly lower than their healthy peers for the quality of the canter, jumping technique, and ability and their character. The pain associated with arthropathic conditions likely makes the horses unwilling to push powerfully off their hindlegs, a quality necessary for jumping and cantering and which could make the horse appear lazy or unwilling to work.|$|E
500|$|Ten {{was not an}} {{immediate}} success, but by late 1992 it had reached number two on the Billboard 200 chart. The album produced three hit singles: [...] "Alive", [...] "Even Flow", and [...] "Jeremy". While Pearl Jam was accused of <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> grunge bandwagon at the time—despite the fact that Ten had been both recorded and released before Nirvana's Nevermind—Ten was instrumental in popularizing alternative rock in the mainstream. In February 2013, the album crossed the 10 million mark in sales, becoming the 22nd one {{to do so in}} the Nielsen SoundScan era and has been certified 13× platinum by the RIAA. It remains Pearl Jam's most commercially successful album.|$|E

Boggs celebrated the victory with a memorable moment of <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> horse of a NYPD officer during the celebration. The Yankees, like the rest of baseball, were still reeling from what was lost in 1994, because many members of the 1994 team were not there in 1996.

After meeting, they decided to contact songwriter Miles Gregory to use one of his songs for Whitfield's record group Rose Royce. Buckmaster found that Gregory was under medication from overuse of drugs and [...] "was in considerable discomfort, if not in outright pain. He didn't write a song and dance about his pain, but I remember him sitting at the piano and wincing. So before <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> thing that Miles was merely indulging himself and writing, one has to remember that the guy was in a lot of pain." [...] Nevertheless, Whitfield and Buckmaster encouraged Gregory to write the song and the result was [...] "Love Don't Live Here Anymore", inspired by Gregory's own situation and his deteriorating physical health.|$|E

500|$|In {{addition}} to helping pick a president, Ohio voters in 1908 were {{to choose the}} legislators who would decide whether to re-elect Foraker. The senator had quarreled with President Roosevelt over the Brownsville Affair. Though Foraker had little chance of winning, he sought the Republican presidential nomination against his fellow Cincinnatian, Secretary of War William Howard Taft, who was Roosevelt's chosen successor. On January 6, 1908, Harding's Star endorsed Foraker and upbraided Roosevelt for trying to destroy the senator's career over a matter of conscience. On January 22, Harding in the Star reversed course and declared for Taft, deeming Foraker defeated. According to Sinclair, Harding's change to Taft [...] "was not... because he saw the light but because he felt the heat". <b>Jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Taft bandwagon allowed Harding to survive his patron's disaster—Foraker failed to gain the presidential nomination, and was defeated for a third term as senator. Also helpful in saving Harding's career {{was the fact that}} he was popular with, and had done favors for, the more progressive forces that now controlled the Ohio Republican Party.|$|E
500|$|After {{the tour}} was confirmed, Madonna and her troupe {{started working on}} it. Madonna {{wanted it to be}} [...] "loud and brazen, and a {{reflection}} of my street-style and DGAF attitude." [...] She wanted a concert where people can enjoy themselves as much as she would enjoy performing. Commenting on the development, Madonna said [...] "I normally hate performances where there is just a singer singing, and a lame-ass band playing in the background; or shows where there is a rocker screaming his lungs out and <b>jumping</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> crowd. That just plain sucks! That's why I wanted something different, something that would be memorable." [...] For the show, Madonna collaborated with her designer friend Maripol for the clothes and the fashion. Maripol operated a small fabric boutique called Maripolitan in Greenwich Village, where the designs and the clothes for the tour were decided by her and Madonna. Rehearsals for the show started in late February, with auditions and choosing the dancers going on in-between. Madonna specifically wanted male back-up dancers, citing that the [...] "provocating moves that I do on stage works better with men beside me." [...] To further promote the tour, Warner Bros. Entertainers Merchandise Management Corp. introduced [...] the Boy Toy collection, named after the belt buckle Madonna wore on the Like a Virgin album cover picture. It consisted of a rectangular buckle, with the words [...] "Boy" [...] and [...] "Toy" [...] emblazed on it in gold color. For choosing a music director for the tour, Madonna's manager Freddy DeMann contacted record producer Patrick Leonard, who had just returned from the Victory Tour by The Jackson 5. At first Leonard said no, feeling exhausted from the Victory Tour, but after he spoke to Madonna on the phone, he found her charming, and agreed to sign for the tour.|$|E

2500|$|In 1965, Paxton {{made his}} first tour of the United Kingdom. The tour was the {{beginning}} of a still-thriving professional relationship that has included yearly performances there. He met Bruce Woodley, one of the founding members of the Australian folk group The Seekers and they collaborated on the song [...] "Angeline (Is Always Friday)" [...] which The Seekers recorded and featured in their concerts, TV shows and a DVD. In 1967, the rock group Clear Light recorded a menacing and lengthy psychedelic version of Paxton's song [...] "Mr. Blue" [...] on their only album Clear Light.
