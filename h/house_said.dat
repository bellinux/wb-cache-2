Krasner's Organized Hypocrisy (1999): [...] "the paradox that though there is an informal understanding that states are sovereign, they can still be subject to constant intervention". Jane Kinninmont of Chatham <b>House</b> <b>said</b> Tamarod protests would not succeed to replicate the Egyptian scenario [...] "because the army in Bahrain doesn't play the same role, and many of the security services don’t include Shi'ite Bahrainis, so you don’t get that same sense of solidarity".

500|$|On July 2, 1993, the White House {{issued its}} own 80-page {{report on the}} firings, one that the New York Times termed [...] "strikingly self-critical". [...] Co-written by Chief of Staff McLarty, it criticized five White House officials, {{included}} McLarty himself, Watkins, Kennedy, Cornelius, and another, for dismissing the Travel Office members improperly, for appearing to pressure the FBI into its involvement, and for allowing friends of the Clintons {{to become involved in}} a matter with which they had a business stake. [...] It said that the employees should instead have been placed on administrative leave. [...] However, the White <b>House</b> <b>said</b> no illegal actions had occurred, and no officials would be terminated; this did not satisfy Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole, who called for an independent investigation. [...] As Chief of Staff McLarty personally apologized to the fired Travel Office employees — some of whom had all their personal documents and travel photographs related to years of service thrown out during the firing process — and said they would be given other jobs (which five of them were; Dale and his assistant director retired.) [...] The White House report also contained the initial indications of the First Lady's involvement in the firings, saying that she had taken an interest in the Travel Office's alleged mismanagement and had been informed two days in advance that the firings would take place. [...] There was no indication of involvement from President Clinton himself, although he had earlier taken broad public responsibility for what had happened.|$|E
