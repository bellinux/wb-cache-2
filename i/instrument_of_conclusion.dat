40|$|Introduction. Behavioral and {{psychological}} symptoms of dementia (BPSD) {{are defined as}} a group of symptoms of disturbed perceptive thought content, mood, or behavior that include agitation, depression, apathy, repetitive questioning, psychosis, aggression, sleep problems, and wandering. Care of patients with BPSD involves pharmacological and nonpharmacological interventions. We reviewed studies of nonpharmacological interventions published in the last 10 years. Methods. We performed a systematic review in Medline and Embase databases, in the last 10 years, until June 2015. Key words used were (1) non-pharmacological interventions, (2) behavioral symptoms, (3) psychological symptoms, and (4) dementia. Results. We included 20 studies published in this period. Among these studies, program activities were more frequent (five studies) and the symptoms more responsive to the interventions were agitation. Discussion. Studies are heterogeneous in many aspects, including size sample, intervention, and <b>instruments</b> <b>of</b> measures. <b>Conclusion.</b> Nonpharmacological interventions are able to provide positive results in reducing symptoms of BPSD. Most studies have shown that these interventions have important and significant efficacy...|$|R

It provides {{a brief description}} of reinsurance in general, insurance-linked securities and catastrophe bonds. The goal of this thesis is to describe the development of cat bond market and the influence of economic and natural shocks on it. In order to analyze the effect, quarter issuance data are used together with Swiss Re Cat Bonds return indexes. In addition, several other variables (i. e. Munich Re and Swiss Re stock prices) and indexes are used. The most important indexes are Merrill Lynch high yield bonds and structured products. The shocks' influence is examined by analyzing the correlation between cat bonds yields and other financial <b>instruments.</b> The <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> the thesis is that during economic boom cat bonds are correlated with other <b>instruments.</b> In times <b>of</b> recession cat bonds' yields prove to be negatively or not correlated with other negatively affected instrument...|$|R

40|$|With {{the plethora}} of {{articles}} describing a relationship between social support and/or social network and health status, it was considered useful {{to take stock of}} the current status of research in this area, focusing on two critical methodological issues: clarity of definition, and validity and reliability <b>of</b> the measurement <b>instruments.</b> <b>Of</b> the 33 <b>instruments</b> reviewed only modest agreement was found in conceptual definition, and frequently the concepts were not defined or ill-defined. Of particular concern is the definitional confusion between social support and social network. Variables used to operationalize these concepts confirm this lack of specificity and ambiguity in definition. As for validity and reliability, many of the investigators reported no data on these issues; others provided information that only modestly supported the validity or reliability <b>of</b> their <b>instrument.</b> The <b>conclusion</b> <b>of</b> this assessment suggests the need to clarify the essential elements of social support and social networks in order to better distinguish between the behavioral (support) and structural (network) variables that may be affecting health status. A question is also raised as to the likelihood of a single questionnaire being designed that would accurately measure the perceptions of support or supportive behaviors in the variety of supportive research that will continue to be studied. Finally, more rigorous standards need to be used by investigators in establishing the validity and reliability <b>of</b> the <b>instruments</b> in order ro improve their predictive utility. social support social network conceptual definition operationalization validity reliability...|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} this {{dissertation}} concerns the proper law of the Society of Jesus, specifically its Constitutions, Part VIII, which deals with the general congregation as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> governance, and how it functions as the Order's supreme legislative authority. As a means for analyzing the basic question or problem, an historical methodology has been used throughout the study. Thus, the dissertation looks at specific examples of how various general congregations throughout the Society's history have functioned as the supreme authority and as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> governance, and at how well these assemblies accomplished their intended purpose. By analyzing selected congregations, the dissertation offers an historical survey of the general congregation's accomplishments and shortcomings over time. As a result, this study presents a critical evaluation of the general congregation as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> governance. The first chapter is entitled "St. Ignatius and the Early Years of the Society" and it focuses on a few key events that help {{shed light on the}} spiritual background and psychology of the man who founded the Society of Jesus and wrote its Constitutions. These events give an insight into Ignatius' fundamental belief-system and help establish his general philosophy of governance. The second chapter is entitled "The General Congregation According to the Constitutions"; it closely examines Part VIII of the Constitutions and, in particular, its six chapters which deal specifically with the general congregation. Thus, Chapter Two constitutes a thorough examination of the Society's proper law, updated to the most recent congregation, {{as it relates to the}} general congregation as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> governance. The third chapter is entitled "The General Congregation and the Superior General"; it looks at certain aspects of the executive office in light of the superior general's significant role vis-a-vis the general congregation. Although the general congregation is the supreme legislative body, the Roman pontiff remains the "Supreme Legislator" of this pontifical Institute. Therefore, the fourth chapter, entitled "The General Congregation and the Papacy," examines the Society's special relationship with the Roman pontiff and the enormous influence of the papacy, especially with regard to papal interventions both preceding and during the general congregations. Finally, the fifth chapter is entitled "By Way <b>of</b> <b>Conclusion</b> [...] .," and it concludes this study with certain observations on the general congregation's strengths and weaknesses as an <b>instrument</b> <b>of</b> governance.
