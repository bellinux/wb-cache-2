Rabbit, mink, muskrat, fox, bear, squirrel and other furs, deer, elk, moose hair and chicken, pheasant, turkey, duck, goose and partridge feathers are commonly incorporated into artificial flies. Chicken neck and saddle hackle, so essential for many artificial fly patterns, are from animals especially bred to produce hackles of superior performance and color. Synthetics have allowed fly tyers to replicate rare and sometimes endangered furs and feathers as well as create completely new types of flies. Synthetics such as rubber legs, plastic wings and transparent plastic cords, chenilles, and all sorts and colors of flashy materials that can be incorporated into the wings and bodies of today's artificial fly are available to the 21st-century fly tyer.

40|$|Many adult {{traits in}} Drosophila melanogaster show {{phenotypic}} plasticity, {{and the effects}} of diet on traits such as lifespan and reproduction are well explored. Although plasticity in response to food is still present in older flies, it is unknown how sustained environmental variation affects life-history traits. Here, we explore how such life-long fluctuations of food supply affect weight and survival in groups of <b>flies</b> and affect <b>weight,</b> survival and reproduction in individual flies. In both experiments, we kept adults on constant high or low food and compared these to flies that experienced fluctuations of food either once or twice a week. For these ‘yoyo’ groups, the initial food level and the duration of the dietary variation differed during adulthood, creating four ‘yoyo’ fly groups. In groups of <b>flies,</b> survival and <b>weight</b> were affected by adult food. However, for individuals, survival and reproduction, but not weight, were affected by adult food, indicating that single and group housing of female flies affects life-history trajectories. Remarkably, both the manner and extent to which life-history traits varied in relation to food depended on whether flies initially experienced high or low food after eclosion. We therefore conclude that the expression of life-history traits in adult life is affected not only by adult plasticity, but also by early adult life experiences. This is an important but often overlooked factor in studies of life-history evolution and may explain variation in life-history experiment...|$|R
40|$|Walking {{behavior}} is context-dependent, {{resulting from the}} integration of internal and external influences by specialized motor and pre-motor centers. Neuronal programs must be sufficiently flexible to the locomotive challenges inherent in different environments. Although insect studies have contributed substantially to {{the identification of the}} components and rules that determine locomotion, we still lack an understanding of how multi-jointed walking insects respond to changes in walking orientation and direction and strength of the gravitational force. In order to answer these questions we measured with high temporal and spatial resolution the kinematic properties of untethered Drosophila during inverted and vertical walking. In addition, we also examined the kinematic responses to increases in gravitational load. We find that animals are capable of shifting their step, spatial and inter-leg parameters in order to cope with more challenging walking conditions. For example, flies walking in an inverted orientation decreased the duration of their swing phase leading to increased contact with the substrate and, as a result, greater stability. We also find that when <b>flies</b> carry additional <b>weight,</b> thereby increasing their gravitational load, some changes in step parameters vary over time, providing evidence for adaptation. However, above a threshold that is between 1 and 2 times their body <b>weight</b> <b>flies</b> display locomotion parameters that suggest they are no longer capable of walking in a coordinated manner.

40|$|Steel slag is a {{by-product}} of steelmaking and refining processes. In 2006, 10 - 15 million metric ton of steel slag was generated in the U. S. Out of the total steel slag produced in the U. S. every year, about 50 - 70 % is used as aggregate for road and pavement construction and approximately 15 - 40 % is stockpiled in steel plants and eventually landfilled at slag disposal sites. Since current levels of steel slag stockpiling and landfilling are not sustainable, alternative geotechnical engineering applications for steel slag are being explored to alleviate the slag disposal problem and to help save dwindling natural resources. The main objectives of this research were to determine the geotechnical engineering properties of two types of steel slag generated from different steelmaking operations and to assess their potential use in subgrade stabilization and embankment construction. Samples of fresh and aged basic-oxygen-furnace (BOF) slag and of fresh electric-arc-furnace-ladle (EAF(L)) slag were characterized {{through a series of}} laboratory tests (specific gravity, grain-size analysis, X-ray diffraction, compaction, maximum and minimum density, large-scale direct shear, consolidated drained triaxial and swelling tests). The effects of gradation on the engineering properties of both fresh and aged steel slag samples were also investigated. Various mixtures of steel slag [BOF and EAF(L) ] and Class-C fly ash were also investigated. The mixtures were prepared by adding 5 and 10 % Class-C <b>fly</b> ash (by <b>weight)</b> to aged BOF slag and 5, 10 and 20 % Class-C <b>fly</b> ash (by <b>weight)</b> to fresh EAF(L) slag. Unconfined compression tests were performed after various curing times to evaluate the strength gain characteristics of the mixtures. Long-term swelling tests were performed for compacted mixtures of both fresh and aged BOF slag and 10 % Class-C <b>fly</b> ash (by <b>weight)</b> and for compacted mixtures of fresh EAF(L) slag and 5, 10 and 20 % Class-C <b>fly</b> ash (by <b>weight).</b> The effect of adding 10 % ground rubber (by weight) to fresh and aged BOF slag on the long-term swelling behavior of the mixtures was also investigated. The optimum moisture content and maximum dry unit weight of BOF slag were in the ranges of 4 - 8 % and 19. 5 - 21. 8 kN/m 3, respectively. The critical-state friction angle of fresh and aged BOF slags was in the 45. 3 °- 48. 1 ° range according to large-scale direct shear test results. Based on isotropically consolidated drained triaxial test (CIDTX) results, the peak friction angles of aged BOF slag (with minus 9. 5 mm gradation) samples prepared at 90 % relative compaction were equal to 47. 3 °, 45. 2 ° and 43. 5 ° at effective confining stresses of 50, 110 and 200 kPa, respectively. The optimum moisture content and maximum dry unit weight of EAF(L) slag were in the ranges of 10 - 13 % and 16. 8 - 20. 0 kN/m 3, respectively. The critical-state friction angle of fresh EAF(L) slag was equal to approximately 40. 6 ° according to large-scale direct shear tests results. Compacted mixtures of both Class-C fly ash and BOF slag and of Class-C fly ash and EAF(L) slag showed excellent strength gain properties with time. Results of the long-term swelling tests on steel slag and Class-C fly ash mixtures showed that the addition of 10 % Class-C fly ash suppresses the swelling of both BOF and EAF(L) slag samples to negligible levels...|$|R
