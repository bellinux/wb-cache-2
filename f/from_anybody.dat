5|$|Physically, Britten {{was never}} robust. He walked and swam {{regularly}} and kept himself as fit as he could, but Carpenter in his 1992 biography mentions 20 illnesses, {{a few of}} them minor but most fairly serious, suffered over the years by Britten before his final heart complaint developed. Emotionally, according to some commentators, Britten never completely grew up, retaining in his outlook something of a child's view of the world. He was not always confident that he was the genius others declared him to be, and though he was hypercritical of his own works, he was acutely, even aggressively sensitive to criticism <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> else.|$|E

500|$|The Spanish {{media has}} often {{compared}} Villa with Raúl, {{to the point}} where Villa was accused of taking the number 7 jersey away from the then-Real Madrid player. In March 2009, Villa spoke out, saying, [...] "I have not taken anything away <b>from</b> <b>anybody,</b> I was simply playing well for my club and the national coach gave me an opportunity.

500|$|In {{writing the}} script, O'Bannon drew {{inspiration}} from many previous works of science fiction and horror. He later stated that [...] "I didn't steal Alien <b>from</b> <b>anybody.</b> I stole it from everybody!" [...] The Thing from Another World (1951) inspired the idea of professional men being pursued by a deadly alien creature through a claustrophobic environment. Forbidden Planet (1956) gave O'Bannon {{the idea of a}} ship being warned not to land, and then the crew being killed one by one by a mysterious creature when they defy the warning. Planet of the Vampires (1965) contains a scene in which the heroes discover a giant alien skeleton; this influenced the Nostromo crew's discovery of the alien creature in the derelict spacecraft. O'Bannon has also noted the influence of [...] "Junkyard" [...] (1953), a short story by Clifford D. Simak in which a crew lands on an asteroid and discovers a chamber full of eggs. He has also cited as influences Strange Relations by Philip José Farmer (1960), which covers alien reproduction, and various EC Comics horror titles carrying stories in which monsters eat their way out of people.|$|E

500|$|On November 28, in {{response}} to this incident, a Chilean government spokesman stated that a scheduled visit to Chile by the Peruvian defense minister, Antero Flores Aráoz, might be inopportune given the circumstances. The following day, Flores Aráoz announced his decision to postpone his trip after conferring with the Foreign Affairs Minister, José García Belaúnde. Several members of the Peruvian government commented on the spokesman's remarks including president García who said the country [...] "did not accept pressure or orders <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> outside of Peru". Donayre defended the video, declaring that Peruvian citizens have a right to say whatever they want at private gatherings and that even though he is scheduled to retire on December 5 he will not be forced to resign early under external pressure. As a consequence of these exchanges, tensions between Peru and Chile rose again; president Bachelet met with top aides on December 1 to discuss the matter and possible courses of action. Meanwhile, in Lima, Congressman Gustavo Espinoza became the center of attention as the main suspect of leaking the video to Chilean press and politicians. Donayre ended his tenure as Commanding General of the Army on December 5, 2008, as expected; president Alan García appointed General Otto Guibovich as his replacement.|$|E
500|$|While {{promoting}} the album, Cole said [...] "R, rock and pop {{has always been}} my forte" [...] and called the music something {{she wished she had}} recorded [...] "at least five years ago". She revealed her dissatisfaction with being labeled a jazz singer and her desire to showcase her versatility as an artist, saying she aimed to [...] "put out some music that we hadn't heard in a long time <b>from</b> <b>anybody,</b> really". The project was Cole's first collaboration with R producer Dallas Austin. Rashod Ollison of The Virginian-Pilot wrote the album represented how [...] " [...] had hung up the gowns and returned to her soul roots"; in past performances, Cole would wear gowns when singing jazz. During the production of the album, Verve Records stipulated that it must include original material. One of the two new songs [...] "Five Minutes Away" [...] was based on Cole's experiences with Austin and keyboard player Chanz Parkman. Prior to the album's release, CBS News Caitlin Johnson wrote that it was [...] "a sharp turn for a woman perhaps best known for singing jazz standards." [...] She connected the project to Cole's decision to reinvent herself, saying that its title represented [...] "leaving the past behind".|$|E
500|$|When Alan McGee, Creation's {{publicist}} Johnny Hopkins, {{and marketing}} executive Emma Greengrass first heard Be Here Now at Noel Gallagher's house, each had their doubts about its artistic value, but kept their doubts to themselves. One Creation employee recalled [...] "{{a lot of}} nodding of heads, a lot of slapping of backs." [...] McGee later admitted to having strong misgivings at first: [...] "I heard it {{in the studio and}} I remember saying 'We'll only sell seven million copies'... I thought it was too confrontational." [...] However, {{in an interview with the}} music press a few days later he predicted the album would sell twenty million copies. McGee's hyperbole alarmed both Oasis and their management company Ignition, and both immediately excluded him from involvement in the release campaign. Ignition's strategy from that point on centred on an effort to suppress all publicity, and withheld access to both music and information <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> not directly involved with the album's release. Fearful of the dangers of over-hype and bootlegging, their aim was to present the record as a [...] "regular, everyday collection of tunes." [...] To this end they planned a modest marketing budget, to be spent on subdued promotional activities such as street posters and music press adverts, while avoiding mainstream instruments such as billboard and TV advertising. According to Greengrass [...] "We want to keep it low key. We want to keep control of the whole mad thing." ...|$|E

2500|$|Seinfeld broke several {{conventions}} of mainstream television. The show offers no growth or reconciliation to its characters. It eschews sentimentality. An episode is typically driven by humor interspersed with the superficial conflicts of characters with peculiar dispositions. Many episodes {{revolve around the}} characters' involvement {{in the lives of}} others with typically disastrous results. On the set, the notion that the characters should not develop or improve throughout the series was expressed as the [...] "no hugging, no learning" [...] rule. Also unlike most sitcoms, there are no moments of pathos; the audience is never made to feel sorry for any of the characters. Even Susan's death elicits no genuine emotions <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> in the show.|$|E

2500|$|After 1723, the {{situation}} seemed to stabilise, {{much to the}} delight of the Dutch. Javanese nobility had learned that the alliance of VOC’s military with any Javanese faction made them nearly invincible. It seemed that VOC’s plan to reap the profit from a stable Java under a kingdom which was deeply indebted to VOC would soon be realised. In 1726, Amangkurat IV fell to an illness that resembled poisoning. His son assumed the throne as Pakubuwana II, this time without any serious resistance <b>from</b> <b>anybody.</b> The history for the period of 1723 until 1741 was dominated by a series of intrigues which further showed the fragile nature of Javanese politics, held together by Dutch’s effort.

2500|$|Since the Bankruptcy Act 1542 a key {{principle}} of insolvency {{law has been}} that losses are shared among creditors proportionately. Creditors who fall into the same class will share proportionally in the losses (e.g. each creditor gets 50 pence for each £1 she is owed). However, this pari passu principle only operates among creditors within the strict categories of priority set by the law. First, the law permits creditors making contracts with a company before insolvency to take a security interest over a company's property. If the security is refers to some specific asset, the holder of this [...] "fixed charge" [...] may take the asset away free <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> else's interest {{in order to satisfy}} the debt. If two charges are created over the same property, the charge holder with the first will have the first access. Second, the Insolvency Act 1986 section 176ZA gives special priority to all the fees and expenses of the insolvency practitioner, who carries out an administration or winding up. The practitioner's expenses will include the wages due on any employment contract that the practitioner chooses to adopt. But controversially, the Court of Appeal in Krasner v McMath held this would not include the statutory requirement to pay compensation for a management's failure to consult upon collective redundancies. Third, even if they are not retained, employees' wages up to £800 and sums due into employees' pensions, are to be paid under section 175. Fourth, {{a certain amount of money}} must be set aside as a [...] "ring fenced fund" [...] for all creditors without security under section 176A. This is set by statutory instrument as a maximum of £600,000, or 20 per cent of the remaining value, or 50 per cent of the value of anything under £10,000. All these preferential categories (for insolvency practitioners, employees, and a limited amount for unsecured creditors) come in priority to the holder of a floating charge.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{common law}} used {{to allow a}} claim <b>from</b> <b>anybody</b> who had money, but had lost it or had been {{deprived}} of it, from {{a person who had}} received the money without payment, as of right. This action for [...] "money had and received" [...] was, however, limited to money, and was said to be limited to money in physical form. In equity, an action could be brought for return of any property that could be traced, but the courts said liability was limited to people who in some sense had [...] "knowledge" [...] of a breach of trust. In 2001, the Court of Appeal in Bank of Credit and Commerce International (Overseas) Ltd v Akindele stated that the touchstone of liability is that a defendant acted [...] "unconscionably". In that case, Akindele, a Nigerian businessman, was sued by the liquidators of the disgraced and insolvent bank, BCCI to return over $6.6m. Akindele said he received this payment, so far as he knew, as part of a legitimate fixed return deal, when in fact BCCI was engaging in a fraudulent scheme to buy its own shares, and thus inflate its share price. Nourse LJ held that on these facts, Akindele had done nothing [...] "unconscionable" [...] and was not liable to return the money. In other cases, however, it is apparent that the standard has been less lenient, and set at negligence. In 1980 in Belmont Finance Corp v Williams Furniture Ltd Goff LJ held that if one [...] "ought to know, that it was a breach of trust" [...] when property is received then liability will follow. Accordingly, different courts have differed on the requisite threshold of liability. Some have thought liability for receipt should be limited to [...] "wilfully and recklessly failing to make such inquiries as an honest and reasonable man would make", while others have favoured a simple negligence standard, when a breach of trust would have been obvious to an honest, reasonable person. The latter view is consistent with an unjust enrichment analysis, favoured by the late Peter Birks and Lord Nicholls in extrajudicial writing. This favours strict liability upon receipt of any property, unless it is paid for. If the recipient is not a bona fide purchaser, they must make restitution of the property to the former owner to avoid unjust enrichment. This was an approach adopted by the House of Lords in Re Diplock. However, unlike Re Diplock the modern unjust enrichment analysis would allow a defence, if the recipient had changed her position, for instance by spending money that would not otherwise have been spent, a defence recognised in Lipkin Gorman v Karpnale. This approach ends by suggesting that even if the property is paid for, yet the recipient ought to have known that it came from a breach of trust, they will be deemed to have committed an equitable wrong (i.e. like a tort) and must restore the property to the previous owner anyway. It {{remains to be seen whether}} equity's understanding of conscience will align with the standard test for the duty of care in tort.|$|E

The only confirmed artists so far is the roster from Psychopathic Records; however, any artists that has performed at the Gathering or is associated with the juggalos or whomever truly supports the family, should attend as well to support the movement. In the November 17, 2016 edition of the hatchet herald it was announced that Psychopathic Records new in-house engineer is Native World Inc.'s own artist Str8Jaket, and he is currently working with the new artist on the label. In late November 2016 it was said that a new Psychopathic Psypher titled If We Were A Gang would be released on January 1, 2017 with an accompanying music video. It was also stated that with the speculation of who is on or not on Psychopathic Records, the Psypher will feature all artists currently on the label. Also a website for the Juggalo March On Washington will be up on January 1, 2017. On the December 22, 2016 edition of Psychopathic Radio, Violent J stated that over 200 acts have been invited to the March. He also stated that on the website you can view each invite (each invite was created specifically for each individual artist) and if the artist accepts (a yellow diamond will appear) or if the artist declines (a red x will appear). Violent J also stated that for each artist that accepts they will be sent an audio clip and will record a 16 bar verse, and then will record it and shoot a video for their verse, for a special cypher that will be released aside from If We Were A Gang. On December 31, 2016 at 3:00pm EST it was announced that Young Wicked of Axe Murder Boyz has left Psychopathic Records and has signed with Majik Ninja Entertainment.|$|E
