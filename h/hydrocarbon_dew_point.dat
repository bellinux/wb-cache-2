40|$|ASME LectureSaudi Aramco {{has focused}} more {{attention}} {{in recent years}} on fuel gas conditioning for land-based industrial and aeroderivative combustion gas turbines CGTs. <b>Hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> and entrained solids are two important fuel quality issues that frequently trouble CGT operators, partly because they cannot be guaranteed by the fuel suppliers and they are rarely monitored by the operators. This paper addresses these issues and offers some practical advice to optimize the design and operation of fuel gas delivery systems. Saudi Aramco has been testing an automated on-line <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> monitor capable of detecting both <b>hydrocarbon</b> and aqueous <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> in natural gas. <b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> monitoring conducted at three locations on the fuel gas grid revealed wide variations in the <b>hydrocarbon</b> and aqueous <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> due {{to a variety of}} conditions. Gas production and pipeline operations were responsible for the most dramatic variations in <b>dew</b> <b>points,</b> but exposure of pipelines to the weather can also be important. Measurement of pipeline solids for the purpose of sizing and placement of particle filters have also been explored. Pipeline scraping, gas velocities, length of pipeline span, pipeline junctions and control valves are all considerations for solid control strategies. The optimized design and operation of a CGT fuel system is highly dependent of <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> control and efficient removal of entrained pipeline solids. Practical experience in monitoring <b>hydrocarbon</b> and aqueous <b>dew</b> <b>points,</b> pipeline solids control, and optimizing fuel conditioning equipment will be presented...|$|R
40|$|Supersonic {{separator}} is a {{new technology}} with applications in <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>pointing</b> and gas dehydration {{which can be used}} to condensate and separate water and heavy hydrocarbons from natural gas. Many researchers have studied the design, performance and efficiency, economic viability, and industrial applications of these separators. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to succinctly review recent progress in the design and application of supersonic separators and their limitations. This review has found that while several aspects of this study are well studied, considerable gaps within the published literature still exists in the areas such as turndown flexibility which is a critical requirement to cater for variation of mass flow and since almost all the available designs have a fixed geometry and therefore cannot be considered suitable for variable mass flow rate, which is a common situation in actual site. Hence, the focus needs to be more on designing a flexible geometry that can maintain a high separation efficiency regardless of inlet conditions and mass flow variations. This review is focusing only on the design and application of the supersonic separators without going through the experimental facilities, industrial platform, pilot plants as well as theoretical, analytical, and numerical modelling...|$|R

Temperature measurements are accurate to 10 mK and pressure measurements are accurate to 0. 002 MPa. The isochoric method utilizes pressure versus temperature measurements along an isomole and detects phase boundaries by locating {{the change in the}} slope of the isochores.

If exposed to an aqueous solvent, mass {{transfer}} may take {{place between the}} flue gas and the solvent. Depending on the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and the difference in temperature between the two fluids, the solvent may be either enriched or diluted. In power cycles with CCS, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> generally depends on fuel, capture technology, and plant efficiency. Against this background, a dew-point model is defined, {{taking into account the}} fuel composition combined with optional combustion principles (air-blown or oxygen-based), net plant efficiency and the rate at which CO 2 is being removed. The purpose is a) to assess the exhaust gas composition from which the detailed flue gas composition and emission indices can be derived, and b) to estimate the corresponding <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> whereby the net water demand (either for make-up or retrieval) is determined depending on flue gas temperature. Four cases are presented in dual operation mode. Except for coal-based power cycles operating on wet lignite, the study suggests that a significant amount of make-up water is required in post-combustion mode. Conversely, the study reveals that some power cycles (and fuels) are capable of offering net water recovery from the flue gas, especially in oxy-combustion mode. The study also illustrates the sensitivity of water balancing. Hence, the net amount of water should be carefully addressed on a techno-economic basis and by taking into account the seasonal availability of process water, especially in regions hampered by limited water supply...|$|R
40|$|The burning {{characteristics}} {{of natural gas}} and the determination of its inter-changeability with liquefied petroleum gas on domestic burners are presented in this paper. Earlier studies had sought the correlation of heating values with specific gravities {{as a basis for}} determining the interchangeability of the gas. In this study, it is established that, additionally burning characteristics, which depend on chemical composition, must also be included to accurately predict the range of interchangeability achievable in a given situation. The Wobbe Number, combustion potential and yellow tip index are calculated for both liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) and various compositions representative of associated low-pressure and non-association high pressure natural gas. These were then graphically presented as area enclosed by lines representing limits of flash back, lifting and incomplete combustion. It is found that natural gas can be interchanged with LPG as substitute gas for domestic burners, without adjustment of the burner nozzle. The necessary condition for this is that the quality of combustion for the associated natural gas is enhanced when it is fed into the burner above the <b>hydrocarbon</b> and water <b>dew</b> <b>points</b> of the gas, and at twice the pressure at which bottled liquefied petroleum gas is usually supplied to the burners...|$|R
50|$|Membrane {{air dryers}} depress the {{incoming}} <b>dew</b> <b>point.</b> Most dryers have a challenge air <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and pressure specification. So if the inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> {{is lower than}} the specified challenge air then the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is even lower than specified. For example, a dryer could be rated at a −40 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> with a challenge of +70 °F <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> and 100 psig. If the incoming air has an inlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of only 32 °F, the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be somewhat less. Pressure also plays a role. If the pressure is higher than the rated specification then the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> will be lowered. This lowering of the outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is due to the longer residence time that the air has inside the membrane. Using the spec above, an operating pressure of 120 psig will yield a lower outlet <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> than specified. The extent of the improvement is dependent {{on the nature of the}} membrane and could vary among manufacturers.|$|R

5|$|<b>Dew</b> <b>point</b> is the {{temperature}} {{to which a}} given parcel of air must be cooled, at constant atmospheric pressure, for water vapor to condense into water. The condensed water is called <b>dew.</b> The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is a saturation <b>point.</b> When the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> temperature falls below freezing {{it is called the}} frost point, as the water vapor no longer creates dew but instead creates frost or hoarfrost by deposition. The <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is associated with relative humidity. A high relative humidity indicates that the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is closer to the current air temperature. If the relative humidity is 100%, the <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> is equal to the current temperature. Given a constant <b>dew</b> <b>point,</b> an increase in temperature will lead to a decrease in relative humidity.

50|$|The most {{westerly}} of the terminals {{is owned}} by Eni of Italy. It receives gas from two 30-inch pipelines from the Hewett field (27.7 km and 32.8 km long) and a 62 km long 20-inch pipeline from Lancelot 48/17A offshore installation (LAPS complex). A decommissioned 24-inch pipeline formerly delivered gas from the Thames 49/28A offshore installation. Gas and liquid from each pipeline are received and processed separately. After gas and condensate are separated in vessel-type slugcatchers and filter-separators each gas stream is fiscally metered (for tax purposes). The two Hewett field gas streams are combined and increased in pressure through an eductor. The gas stream was formerly treated with amine to remove sulphur compounds, this facility was decommissioned in 2000 when production from the sour Hewett Upper Bunter reservoir was shut-in. The gas is comingled with the LAPS gas then compressed. It was formerly dehydrated using triethylene glycol and underwent <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> reduction by chilling with propane. Finally it was fiscally metered (for sales) and transferred to the Bacton NTS plant. Formerly the terminal had pentane storage tanks and a truck loading facility. The terminal has two GE 11MW Frame 3 and one GE 3.7MW Frame 1 gas turbines, connected to three centrifugal compressors. In 2011 the Eni Terminal was split by segregating the reception {{and some of the}} compression facilities from the dehydration and dewpoint control plant, the latter was decommissioned. Now after compression the gas is sent to the Perenco site for dehydration and dewpoint control. The separated condensate is also sent to the Perenco site. During late 2013/2014 the redundant processing facilities were removed and now the majority of the Eni site is unused.|$|E
40|$|Abstract]: A gas {{chromatograph}} {{is the most}} common method to continuously determine the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> of export natural gas. It is used to ascertain the composition of the natural gas mixture which is applied to a thermodynamic equation of state. Due to the inherent design of the process type {{gas chromatograph}} there are limitations to the computation of the gas mixture in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. It was found that process type C 9 + gas chromatographs determine a higher <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> than actual, because it summates all the chromatogram hydrocarbon peaks within the respective carbon group into the normalised alkane of that carbon group. The reason for this, is that the process type gas chromatograph does not have a method to identify these species between the normalised alkane components in the C 6 to C 8 carbon groups. Therefore the aim of this project was to research the 'equations of state' used to calculate natural gas <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> from constituent analysis by Gas Chromatography and to develop a methodology to improve Gas Chromatography <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> determination. One important characteristic of the gas chromatograph, is that the measurement of carbon fractions greater than pentane, n - C 5, is based on the relationship of component elution time and hydrocarbon boiling point. The International Standard Organistation standard 23874 (ISO 23874, 2007) uses this relationship to calculate the boiling points of unidentified hydrocarbon components by linear interpolation between the normalised alkanes. The limitation of the ISO 23874 standard is that it is only applicable for laboratory analysis type gas chromatographs. In order to exploit the boiling point and hydrocarbon component elution time relationship to identify unknown components using a process gas chromatograph, the author developed his own method and a modified method of the ISO 23874 standard. Trials on export natural gas, using the equation of state software program, GasVLE, a manual chilled mirror instrument and a Daniel 500 C 9 + gas chromatograph proved that the Grygorcewicz method is a valid characterisation method for further research and use in improving the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> determination of export natural gas when applied to a process gas chromatograph on a custody transfer station or pipeline...|$|E

40|$|The {{knowledge}} of the <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> (HCDP) is of great importance for {{the oil and gas}} industry as it is one of the gas quality specifications used for ensuring safe transport of natural gas. Avoiding hydrocarbon condensation is crucial as the presence of liquids in the pipelines increases the pressure drop and introduces operational problems in pipelines designed for single phase transportation. Thus, accurate measurement and prediction of hydrocarbon dew points are of great importance to obtain a safe and effective utilization of the natural gas pipelines. At the laboratory facilities of Statoil in Trondheim a new rig (GERG rig) for measuring hydrocarbon dew points for natural gases is available. Hydrocarbon dew points were measured in order to study the effect of various factors on the accuracy of the HCDP measurement and, therefore, perform the qualification of the GERG rig. Hydrocarbon dew points are usually predicted using thermodynamic models, such as traditional cubic equations of state, like Soave-Redlich-Kwong (SRK). Previous studies have pointed out that classic EoS are not able to correctly represent the dew point line for natural gases, while more advanced models, such as the UMR-PRU, which is the Universal Mixing Rule combined with Peng Robinson Eos and UNIFAC, give significantly improved predictions. In this diploma thesis, <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> measurements have been performed for two synthetic gases and one real gas. Several experiments have been conducted in order to study the effect of the volume of the sample gas, the chamber?s temperature and the sample conditioning. The results show that there is no volume effect or effect of the sample conditioning. On the other hand, a 10 &# 176;C difference of the chamber?s temperature from 35 to 45 &# 176;C has an effect of approximately 0. 9 &# 176;C on the measured dew points. Given the fact that there is adsorption of heavy hydrocarbons inside the rig, which is a known challenge in HCDP measurements, the effect is more pronounced in gases consisting of heavier compounds, as in the case of the real gas. The dew point experimental data are used to evaluate the reliability of three thermodynamic models: SRK, PC-SAFT and UMR-PRU. All three models studied appear to yield satisfactory results. SRK and PC-SAFT?s predictions are very similar at low pressures up to the cricondentherm temperature, while SRK is better than PC-SAFT at higher pressures. Both these models describe better the experimental data obtained from the synthetic gases than UMR-PRU, except from the high pressures, and especially the cricondenbar pressure, where UMR-PRU gives the best results. Furthermore, the real gas? dew point curve is adequately predicted by UMR-PRU, which yields the best predictions than the other two models. Finally, an uncertainty analysis is performed which further confirms the reliability of the UMR-PRU model. </p...|$|E
40|$|Field A is a {{marginal}} oil field {{located in the}} North Sea, operated by Det norske oljeselskap ASA (hereby Det norske). Det norske are currently working on the maturation of the field development, and have identified three development options. 	Floating production, storage and offloading (FPSO), with a bridge link to a well head platform (WHP). 	Subsea tie-back to a host facility. 	Jack-up with production facility (JUDP) and WHP. Produced oil will be stored in a floating storage unit (FSU). The produced oil will be stabilized to the export specifications and offloaded to a shuttle tanker. The base case for gas export is to export wet gas to a platform on another field, Field B, {{where it will be}} dehydrated and conditioned to meet the export specifications in one of the export pipelines connected to the platform. There are however uncertainties concerning the processing suitability at Field B, and Det norske is therefore investigating the possibilities for installing dehydration and conditioning equipment on the Field A platform. In this thesis, different methods for dehydration and conditioning of the Field A gas is tested through process simulations in HYSYS. A mapping of the gas infrastructure in the Field A area reveals two dry gas export pipelines; Statpipe and Vesterled, and two rich gas export pipelines; FUKA and Sage. This thesis is mainly based on dry gas export, and therefore most of the work is put into export in Statpipe or Vesterled. A literature study concerning different methods to dehydrate and condition the gas is performed. The simulations later in the thesis are based on this study. To get a comparison basis for the different development alternatives in terms of weight, costs and complexity, a simulation of a basic Field A process with no dehydration or conditioning is first simulated. This will also be the Field A process if wet gas export to Field B is chosen as the solution for gas protraction at Field A. The basic process is then expanded with different equipment for dehydration of the gas, and the different dehydration processes are briefly evaluated. The dehydration processes are then varied and/or expanded to achieve both adequate dehydration and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> in the gas, based on the export specifications in Statpipe and Vesterled. The final processes, achieving both proper water- and <b>hydrocarbon</b> <b>dew</b> <b>point</b> in the export gas, are evaluated and compared to the basic process without dehydration and conditioning, in terms of weight, costs and complexity,. Based on the findings in this thesis it seems dry gas export from Field A is difficult to achieve. Based on the limited information available from the operating company of Field B, the Field B process is simulated in HYSYS to check the process suitability for the Field A gas. Finally, an alternative solution to achieve dry gas export from Field A, by bleeding off propane in the process, is briefly discussed. The solution of rich gas export in either FUKA or Sage is also briefly discussed. </p...|$|E

One of the key parameters in the recovery of ethane and heavier products from natural gas is the effect of the extraction on the heat content of the residue gas. In this work a simple-to-use generalized correlation is developed for the ethane recovery limit to attain a minimum higher heating value (HHV) for various feed gas compositions. As can be seen from this correlation results, the quantity of inerts in the feed gas has an impact on the ethane recovery level which can be targeted in a plant design. A simple correlation is also developed here to estimate the propane and butanes recovery percent as a function of ethane recovery percent. The tool developed in this study can be of immense practical value for petroleum and gas engineers to have a quick check of the heat content of the residue gas after recovery of ethane and heavier components from natural gas at various conditions without opting for any experimental trials.
