5|$|Well-known poets of the Edwardian {{era of the}} 1890s, such as Alfred Austin, Stephen Phillips, and William Watson, {{had been}} working {{very much in the}} shadow of Tennyson, {{producing}} weak imitations of the poetry of the Victorian era. They continued to work in this vein into {{the early years of the}} 20th century. As the new century opened, Austin was still the serving British Poet Laureate, a post <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to 1913. In the century's first decade, poetry still had a large audience; volumes of verse published in that time included Thomas Hardy's The Dynasts, Christina Rossetti's posthumous Poetical Works, Ernest Dowson's Poems, George Meredith's Last Poems, Robert Service's Ballads of a Cheechako and John Masefield's Ballads and Poems. Future Nobel Prize winner William Butler Yeats was devoting much of his energy to the Abbey Theatre and writing for the stage, producing relatively little lyric poetry during this period. In 1907, the Nobel Prize for Literature was awarded to Rudyard Kipling.|$|E

25|$|Grant {{returned}} to Portsmouth as Director of football in October 2009, and was made manager the following month. After the club's relegation to the Football League Championship Grant resigned and, on 3 June 2010, was appointed {{as manager of}} West Ham United, a role <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> until 15 May 2011, when he was sacked after the club was relegated to the Football League Championship.|$|E
25|$|In his own confession, Gilles {{testified that}} “when the said {{children}} were dead, he kissed them {{and those who}} had the most handsome limbs and heads <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to admire them, and had their bodies cruelly cut open and took delight at the sight of their inner organs; and very often when the children were dying he sat on their stomachs and took pleasure in seeing them die and laughed”.|$|E

25|$|In 1952, he was {{promoted}} to the level of Director of Mathematical Research at Bell Labs. In 1955, he became Director of Research in the Physical Sciences, and remained there until 1958, when he {{was promoted}} again {{to become one of the}} two Vice Presidents in charge of Military Development and Systems Engineering, a position <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to his retirement. He also became a director of Bellcomm, a company associated with the Apollo program.|$|E
25|$|After {{scoring a}} penalty against Motherwell in January 2007, Boyd was {{involved}} in controversy when <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> six fingers, reportedly {{in a show of}} solidarity for former club captain Barry Ferguson (who wore the number six shirt), who had been stripped of his position and dropped from the team following a dispute with Paul Le Guen. Le Guen left the club days later and was replaced by the then Scotland manager Walter Smith. By the end of that season, Boyd scored 25 goals for Rangers in all competitions. Boyd scored his 100th Scottish Premier League goal, and his first against Celtic on 5 May 2007, in a 2–0 victory for Rangers.|$|E
25|$|Paxton {{was visiting}} London in his {{capacity}} as a director of the Midland Railway to meet the chairman John Ellis who was also a member of parliament. He happened to mention an idea he had for the hall, and Ellis promptly encouraged to produce some plans, provided they could be ready in nine days. Unfortunately he was committed for the next few days, but at a board meeting of the railway in Derby, it is said he appeared to be spending much of his time doodling on a sheet of blotting paper. At the end of the meeting <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his first sketch of the Crystal Palace, inspired by the Victoria Regia House. The sketch is now in the Victoria and Albert Museum.|$|E

25|$|The {{first race}} {{of the season in}} Australia saw Irvine {{involved}} in a race ending first lap crash with Williams driver Jacques Villeneuve. At the next race in Brazil, he could only manage sixteenth place, having found his car difficult to drive. Two weeks later he finished a career high second place in Argentina, where Irvine challenged Villeneuve for the lead, who was suffering with a stomach ailment, and his car with brake problems. The result ended demands in the Italian press for Irvine to be sacked. A third place at the next race in San Marino, and another in Monaco two weeks later, gave Irvine his best string of finishes to date. At the Spanish Grand Prix Irvine finished only twelfth and was given a 10-second stop-go penalty, after <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> Olivier Panis and Jean Alesi when running a lap down.|$|E
25|$|During 2010, {{there was}} much debate as to whether Woods' {{continued}} retention of the No. 1 ranking (which <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{until the end of}} October) was justified given his relatively poor form—Woods finished fourth in two major championships in 2010, but failed to finish in the top ten of any other events he entered. During the 2010 season, several of his rivals for the No. 1 spot - including Masters champion Phil Mickelson (who had won four majors since 2004 but had yet to reach No. 1 in the rankings), Lee Westwood (who had yet to win a major but had finished second in both the Masters and Open Championships in 2010), and then Martin Kaymer (who had won the PGA Championship among four worldwide wins)— each missed opportunities to win particular events that would have taken them above Woods, before Westwood finally became world No. 1 on October 31.|$|E
25|$|Gyulay {{fought on}} the upper Rhine in 1794 and 1795. On 8 April 1795, he became Oberst (colonel) of the Benjowsky Infantry Regiment # 31. However, he {{continued}} to lead the Gyulay Freikorps. In 1796, he served under Michael von Fröhlich in Maximilian Baillet de Latour's Army of the Upper Rhine. He fought at Renchen on 28 June and helped cover the subsequent retreat of the Imperial troops. Archduke Charles ordered him to command a force linking the Army of the Upper Rhine and Fröhlich's corps. After the Battle of Ettlingen, Gyulay led Fröhlich's rearguard, earning praise from his superior as a skillful commander of outposts. Later that fall, he greatly distinguished himself in action at Memmingen. For eight hours on 22 September, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the advance 6,000 French with only 1,200 soldiers. On 16 May 1797 he was elevated in rank to General-Major.|$|E

25|$|Cmdre. Felix M. Apolinario, PN {{was born}} on 2 May 1918 in Santa Cruz, Manila. Poling earned the moniker “verbatim” during his senior year, because of his studiousness. After graduation, he joined the OSP, saw action in Bataan as ground support for the 1st Q-Boat Sqdn and beach defense in Lamao. After Bataan fell, he became a POW, was interned in Capas and {{released}} as a sick POW in August 1942. After the war he reported to military control and helped rebuild a new OSP that later became the Philippine Navy. He held various positions that culminated in his becoming FOIC, PN in 1965, a post <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> to his retirement in June 1966. After retirement, Poling established a company dealing with marine electronics, life saving equipment, airplane parts, firefighting and audio equipment. Eleng was also a devoted golfer and played the game as a hobby for many years. He died in July 1999 at age 81.|$|E
25|$|During the war Dooland {{was in an}} Australian Commando unit {{serving in}} the South Pacific. After the war, he played Sheffield Shield cricket for South Australia and took the first post-war hat-trick in Australia. In 1946–47 he was called up for the Third Test in Melbourne against England and took 4/69 and 1/84. More {{importantly}} <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> one end while Colin McCool made his maiden Test century. He was kept for the Fourth Test in Melbourne and again defended stoutly while Keith Miller made his maiden Test century, but returned match figures of 3/198 and was dropped in favour of George Tribe. His Test career ended when, after Doug Ring and Colin McCool were preferred as the leg spin bowlers in the 1948 Australian touring party to England, he came to England {{to play in the}} Lancashire League and then qualified by residence to play for Nottinghamshire (Notts). In 1950-51 He toured India with the Commonwealth team.|$|E
25|$|Several {{years as}} party leader earned Salmond {{an unusually high}} profile for an SNP {{politician}} in the London-based media. In 1998, Salmond won the Spectator Award for Political Strategist of the Year. Following an appearance on the entertainment programme Call My Bluff, Salmond used one of the 'bluff' cards that are used as props in the show {{in the run-up to}} the first elections to the Scottish Parliament. To counter his frustration at having to sit in silence through what he claimed was an inappropriately political speech by Tony Blair at a charity lunch, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the bluff card as the Prime Minister began querying Scotland's economic prospects should independence occur. Throughout his time in politics, Salmond has maintained his interest in horse racing, writing a weekly column for The Scotsman and appearing a number of times on Channel 4's The Morning Line. During the election campaign, Salmond was photographed feeding a young supporter a Solero ice cream during an event at Stirling University, creating a photograph that would become iconic.|$|E

25|$|It was his batting {{that got}} the fans on their feet – not the high scores, but the {{determination}} to stay and grit it out against the Australians. So, with mentor Alan Knott, Russell turned up early for the second Test at Lord's, and for twenty minutes had the MCC ground staff boys throw plastic balls at him – without Russell batting a stroke, just ducking and diving to miss the short deliveries. That day, he also adopted some suitably pungent language {{in response to the}} Aussies' sledging, and after he had scored 64 not out, the Aussies never tried it on him again. In the third Test at Edgbaston, he scored 42, the second highest score of the first innings. But his greatest achievement was to come in the fourth Test at Old Trafford, where in the summer of the South African cricket rebels and near-certain defeat, for six hours <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> Aussie celebrations by scoring his highest-ever score in cricket, 128 not out, to almost save the Test for England. It was also his maiden century in all forms of cricket, an achievement only matched by one other Englishman in the twentieth century - Billy Griffith against West Indies in 1947–48 – but it was largely forgotten in the furore of the South African debacle, and the loss of the series. Russell finished the Ashes series as England's third-most-successful batsman, with 314 runs and an average of 39.25.|$|E
25|$|Prior to {{the first}} {{commercial}} television broadcasts and paid advertisements on WNBT, non-paid television advertising existed on an experimental basis dating back to 1930. NBC's earliest non-paid television commercials may have been those seen during the first Major League Baseball game ever telecast, between the Brooklyn Dodgers and Cincinnati Reds, on August 26, 1939 over W2XBS. In order to secure the rights to televise the game, NBC allowed each of the Dodgers' regular radio sponsors {{at the time to}} have one commercial during the telecast. The ads were conducted by Dodgers announcer Red Barber: for Ivory Soap, <b>he</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a bar of the product; for Mobilgas he put on a filling station attendant's cap while giving his spiel; and for Wheaties he poured a bowl of the product, added milk and bananas, and took a big spoonful. Limited, commercial programming continued until the U.S. entered World War II. Telecasts were curtailed {{in the early years of}} the war, then expanded as NBC began to prepare for full-time service upon the end of the war. Even before the war concluded, a few programs were sent from New York City to affiliated stations in Philadelphia (WPTZ) and Albany/Schenectady (WRGB) on a regular weekly schedule beginning in 1944, the first of which is generally considered to be the pioneering special interest/documentary show The Voice of Firestone Televues, a television offshoot of The Voice of Firestone, a mainstay on NBC radio since 1928, which was transmitted from New York City to Philadelphia and Schenectady on a regular, weekly basis beginning on April 10, 1944. The series is considered to be the NBC television network's first regularly scheduled program.|$|E
500|$|McCoy and the Longhorns lost {{again the}} {{following}} week, in the 2007 Red River Shootout. The game was a back-and-forth affair that was ultimately won by Oklahoma 28–21. OU's freshman quarterback, Sam Bradford, was 21–of–32 for 244 {{yards and three}} touchdowns. McCoy was 19–of–26 for 324 yards and two touchdowns. McCoy threw one interception. McCoy played the game with his throwing arm bandaged from mid-forearm to biceps. <b>He</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> physically despite taking four sacks and a blind-side late hit after one play had been whistled dead. With the loss, Texas opened conference play 0–2 {{for the first time}} since 1956, when they were in the Southwest Conference and one year before Darrell Royal became head coach of the Longhorns.|$|E
