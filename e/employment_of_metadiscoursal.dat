To this end, first, 30 medical and literary journal articles were chosen. Then, 3 successive paragraphs were extracted randomly from each of the selected articles which totaled 90 paragraphs out of which 45 were medical and 45 literary. The frequency and type <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> markers in each text were investigated in accordance with Vande Kopple’s (1985) taxonomy. Next, the total number <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> items in each type of the texts under study was determined. Finally, the Chi-square test was applied to the collected data to compare medical and literary texts. The statistical results gained through the computer suggested that there was a significant difference in the amount and type <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> markers in medical and literary texts...|$|R
40|$|Like {{conversation}} and other modes of communication, {{writing is a}} rich medium for gender performance. In fact, writing functions to construct the disciplines {{as well as the}} gender of its practitioners. Despite the significance of author gender, as one constitutive dimension of any writing, it has been relatively under-researched. One way, by means of which author gender is practiced, and revealed in written discourse, is the incorporation and use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> categories. Examining 20 applied linguistics research articles (10 written by native male English writers and 10 written by native female English writers), the present study sought to examine whether male and female native English writers differed in their use <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. For this purpose, Hyland’s (2005) model of metadiscourse was employed as an analytical framework to identify the type <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. The results of Independent samples t-test showed that English male and female writers did not differ significantly in their overall use of metadiscourse; but, significant differences were observed in categorical distribution <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> elements. The findings of the study can provide a sound basis for the development of pedagogical materials...|$|R
40|$|The study <b>of</b> <b>metadiscoursal</b> {{components}} <b>of</b> academic texts, {{through which}} writers organise, interpret and evaluate content matter, provides one means of examining {{the relationship between}} writer and reader. This paper explores one grammatical feature of metadiscourse, clauses with an anticipatory it and extraposed subject (as in ‘It {{is interesting to note}} that no solution is offered’). This feature is compared in two computerised corpora of text, one consisting of published journal articles from the field of Business Studies and the second of MBA student dissertations written by non-native speakers of English. It-clauses are found to have four main interpersonal roles in hedging, marking the writer's attitude, emphasis, and attribution. The main differences between the two corpora are in the use of it-clauses to persuade readers of the validity of claims, with student writers making an apparently greater and more overt persuasive effort, and stating propositions more forcefully. Proposals are made on why this might be the case, taking into account the different writer-reader relationships in journal articles and dissertations. Implications of the findings for the teaching of academic writing are presented...|$|R
40|$|In the {{situation}} of rapid population aging, postponing retirement is a timely and effective measure in relieving pressure of old age support. However, many people think that postponing retirement will crowd out youth employment. Using data in China, this paper shows that this judgment cannot be supported by empirical evidence. Using data from 1990 census, 2000 census and 2005 1 % population sample survey, this paper examines the impact <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> older persons on <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> younger persons. Our OLS estimation results suggest that <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> younger persons is positively instead of negatively correlated with <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> older persons. We further dealt with the potential endogeneity of the OLS estimation by employing two-way fix-effects and TSLS estimation strategies. The results still suggest that increase <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> older persons will promote rather than depress <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> younger persons. We also found a positive effect <b>of</b> <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> older persons on young workers’ wage. This study suggests that postponing retirement wouldn’t crowd out <b>employment</b> <b>of</b> younger persons. ...|$|R
