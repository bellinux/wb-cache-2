But ther's still some consarvative signs to be found Thet shows the gret heart o' the People is sound: [...] 210 (Excuse me for usin' a stump-phrase agin, But, once in the way on 't, they will stick like sin:) There's Phillips, for instance, hez jes' ketched a Tartar In the Law-'n'-Order Party of ole Cincinnater; An' the Compromise System ain't gone out o' reach, Long 'z you keep the right limits on freedom o' speech.

Navetta ultimately quit the band by setting all of his musical equipment on fire and moving to Oregon, where he became a full-time fisherman.

[...] "He was really fond of those '80s production trappings, and the record is polluted and corrupted with them", Stevenson later reflected, complaining that [...] "It sounds like all weird, reverby, crazy '80s shit." [...] He also recalled that at one point Tarling passed out, leading Stevenson to take over the recording controls: [...] "He was having some kind of problems or something, and he was drinking a lot, and he got so drunk while we were recording that he passed out. So I basically kinda rolled his chair {{out of the way and}} rolled my chair in place of it, and then lo and behold, Bill Stevenson is an engineer! And of course that record sounds terrible! I fucked it up good and well, but that's how I started learning. So it was basically a DIY kinda thing." ...|$|R
