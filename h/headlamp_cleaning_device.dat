50|$|In the 1960s, as {{interest}} in auto safety grew, engineers began researching various <b>headlamp</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems. In late 1968, Chevrolet introduced {{high pressure fluid}} headlamp washers {{on a variety of}} their 1969 models. In 1970, Saab Automobile introduced headlight wipers across their product range. These operated on a horizontal reciprocating mechanism, with a single motor. They were later superseded by a radial spindle action wiper mechanism, with individual motors on each headlamp. In 1972, <b>headlamp</b> <b>cleaning</b> systems became mandatory in Sweden.|$|R

40|$|Many {{types of}} indoor {{pollution}} problems {{are found in}} homes. The most effective approach to solving these problems is usually to remove or reduce the sources of indoor pollution. Ventilation also helps remove indoor air pollutants, but not as effectively as source reduction. Air <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> (air filters and air cleaners) can also be helpful when used along with source reduction and ventilation. The best solution to the air pollution within your home will depend, of course, on your particular problem, the effect it is having on your family's health, and your family’s budget. The information below will help you decide if an air <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> would be useful {{as a part of}} your solution to indoor pollution, and if so, what type might best meet your needs. Many of the principles discussed here also apply to offices, schools, and vehicles. How Effective Are Air <b>Cleaning</b> <b>Devices?</b> Air <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> alone cannot adequately remove all indoor pollutants from homes. This is especially true when the sources emit a large amount of pollution, or when the pollutants settle rapidly on surfaces. Most air <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> will remove some of the particles from the indoor air, but will not effectively remove certain types of pollutants, such as carbon monoxide, radon, odors...|$|R

40|$|A major {{challenge}} commonly faced in reproductive studies of teleosts is to cost effectively and safely separate oocytes {{from one another}} and from surrounding ovarian tissue. This challenge is exacerbated when ovarian tissue has been chemically preserved. Using Platycephalus caeruleopunctatus, a platycephalid species found within oceanic waters along {{the east coast of}} Australia, as an example species, within this study we describe and assess the utility of an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue. The ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> was observed to separate oocytes from the surrounding ovarian tissue within less than 80. min of treatment and had no deleterious effects on the number of oocytes present. Treatment within the ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> reduced oocyte diameters at a constant rate of 3. 9 μm per hour among the samples tested. As the ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> was able to separate oocytes from connective tissue within 80. min, this observed rate of reduction in oocyte diameters is unlikely to be detected at the resolution at which oocytes are traditionally measured and is less than that reported to occur using alternate chemically derived methods to separate oocytes from preserved connective tissue. Following the assessment of using an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from ovarian tissue for P. caeruleopunctatus, this technique has been successfully employed to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue for a variety of other teleost species including Macquaria colonorum, Platycephalus longispinis and Ratabulus diversidens. The use of an ultrasonic <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> to separate oocytes from preserved ovarian tissue will increase the efficiency of future investigations into teleost reproductive biology and potentially in other fields of research where particle separation and analysis are required. 5 page(s...|$|R
40|$|The {{renunciation}} of biocide antifoulings {{is a matter}} of concern to many national and international committees, authorities and interest groups. This mechanical cleaning alternative connected with a suitable biocide-free coating has been examined including the results taken from step I of the F+E plan. Secondary to plan I, further coatings have been examined with regard to their suitability for mechanical cleaning. Altogether, 27 coatings have been used for performing exposition tests and cleaning tests on steel plates in fresh water and salt water. Those coatings were hard coatings, non-stick coatings based on silicone or wax, biocide-free antifouling coatings based on natural ingredients and coatings with waxes/grease. Furthermore three boats were on site for the test in the yachting harbor "ancora". The boats were covered with a silicone anti-adhesive coating and two biocide-free hard coatings. Concurrent activities were the discussion of the question of a license for an automated <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> with the authorities, the estimation of the market potential and a survey about the acceptability. Based on an analysis of the current status of the developments regarding mechanical <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> for pleasure crafts, a rough concept and a fine concept have been developed for an automated <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> and a prototype have been built.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} associations of lifestyle with dental health behaviors such as tooth brushing frequency, use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices,</b> and regular dental visits to a dentist. Methods: Data were collected from 1182 dentate residents 18 years of age or older who resided in a typical farming district. The data included data on the demographic factors, dental health behavior, and various aspects of lifestyle, i. e. mental condition, alcohol consumption, smoking habit, physical activity, social activity, dietary habits, and presence of systemic diseases. Results: Multiple logistic regression analysis revealed that subjects in a younger group (18 – 39 years of age) and subjects who had never smoked brushed their teeth more frequently. Experience of social volunteer work and presence of systemic disease were correlated with use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices.</b> Associations of female gender with frequency of tooth brushing and use of extra <b>cleaning</b> <b>devices</b> were weakly positive.

Accordingly to the recent port plug concept the tube is an optional unit that carries the cleaning system of the first mirror. The <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> shall be a compact instrument at the tube head that influences the tube diameter primarily. Independently of the <b>cleaning</b> <b>device</b> the tube cooling channels and its proper support concept has to be developed. Various manufacturing methods are investigated for the proper layout of the tube cooling structure. They are the gun-drilled deep holes, the solid state bonded sheets forming cooling channels between the welded layers, ‘tube-in-tube’ approach. Most of them were analyzed in view of their thermal conditions. The tube support system design is a complex task, that has to take into account several boundary conditions and limitations. The tube must be compatible with the assumed ITER generic installation procedure, withstand the electromagnetic (EM) and thermal loads. Furthermore, the tube has to be exchanged several times during its lifetime. The paper summarizes the tube cooling layout possibilities and the assumptions on its support concepts...|$|R

Milk quality was determined on bulk tank samples. All teat cleaning systems showed positive effects. Differences were found between brands of AM systems. The level of housing hygiene influenced the level of teat contamination. Three system cleanings per day resulted in a significant lower TBC (10. 000 vs. 13. 000 cfu/ml), number of coliforms, thermodurics and psychrotrophs compared with two system cleanings per day.
