5|$|Special {{weeks have}} also {{included}} shows featuring questions concerning specific topics, such as professional football, celebrity gossip, movies, and pop culture. During {{a week of}} episodes in November 2007, to celebrate the 1,000th episode of the syndicated Millionaire, all contestants that week started with $1,000 {{so that they could}} not leave empty-handed, and only <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> ten questions to win $1,000,000. During that week, twenty home viewers per day also won $1,000 each.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, Philbin {{returned}} to host 12 episodes of a spin-off program titled Who Wants to Be a Super Millionaire in which contestants could potentially win $10,000,000. ABC aired five episodes of this spin-off {{during the week}} of February 22, 2004, and an additional seven episodes later that year in May. As usual, contestants <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> a series of 15 multiple-choice questions of increasing difficulty, but the dollar values rose substantially. The first five questions for Super Millionaire were worth $1,000, $2,000, $3,000, $4,000, $5,000 (the first safe haven), the remaining ten questions were worth $10,000, $20,000, $30,000, $50,000, $100,000 (the second safe haven), $500,000, $1,000,000, $2,500,000, $5,000,000, and $10,000,000.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} was also {{introduced}} {{on the roof}} of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that put two families against each other in various games.

5|$|In May 2009, Ganguly {{was removed}} from the {{captaincy}} of the KKR for the 2009 season of the IPL, and was replaced by McCullum. The decision was questioned by media and other players of the team, when KKR finished {{at the bottom of the}} ranking table with three wins and ten losses. After that, Bengali television channel Zee Bangla roped him as the host of the reality quiz show titled Dadagiri Unlimited. It presented participants from the 19districts of West Bengal, who <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions posed by Ganguly. By August, he was appointed the chairman of CAB's Cricket Development Committee. The job of the committee is to receive a report from the selectors at the end of every cricket season, assess the accountability of the selectors and make necessary recommendations. He played for the Ranji cup in the Bengal team in October 2009. Ganguly scored 110 in the match against Delhi and was involved in a partnership of 222 runs with Wriddhiman Saha.|$|E

25|$|Tickets for the North American tour {{initially}} went on pre-sale, {{exclusively for}} members of the official website. Tickets for all dates went on general sale on 27 June, except for the dates in Washington, which went on 10 July, and Kansas City, on 11 July. Tickets for the Nashville show, which was announced earlier, went on pre-sale on 12 June. General sale began the next day, on 13 June and tickets could be purchased through Ticketmaster. Before the tour began the Myth Nightclub closed. The band issued a statement instructing ticket holders to obtain their new tickets from the new venue's (State Theatre) box-office. These tickets went out on 27 August 2009 at 10am and were exchanged on a first come, first served basis. Tickets for the concert in Seattle were priced at $32 (advance) and $35 (day of show). They could also be bought online or by phone. Tickets for the last concert of the North American Tour, held at The Wiltern LG were priced in the range of $35–$45. For the intimate concert at the Houndstooth Pub, the radio station gave away two passes for the show. Participants <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> a trivia question to be eligible to win. KINK FM (of Portland) held a competition for members to win tickets for the live performance, that ended on 10 October. KNRK radio station of Portland also held a competition where listeners <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to a question, and the winner would be sent backstage at Snow Patrol's concert at The Schnitz on 13 October 2009.|$|E
25|$|The {{question}} {{put to the}} Court {{concerned the}} legality of a declaration of independence made by the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, institutions whose powers were limited to those conferred under {{the framework of a}} United Nations Security Council Resolution. None {{of the participants in the}} proceedings had argued that those institutions had not made the declaration. Nonetheless, the Court determined that the declaration of independence was not issued by the Assembly of Kosovo or otherwise by Provisional Institutions of Self-Government or any other official body. Once this crucial determination was made, the question the Court <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> no longer concerned any action of the Provisional Institutions of Self-Government, as the Court had determined that those institutions had not made the declaration of independence.|$|E
25|$|The Petition {{was read}} {{in front of}} the members of the People's Representative Council (DPR) on 13 May 1980 in an effort to persuade the representatives to ask the {{president}} what he had meant by the two speeches. The delegation to the legislature was led by Maj. Gen. (ret.) Dr Azis Saleh. On 3 July 1980, 19 DPR produced a document containing two number of questions to the president. They asked whether the president agreed that the Expression of Concern contained important issues deserving the attention of all sides, especially the legislature and the government, and whether the people of Indonesia deserved a comprehensive and detailed explanation about the issues raised. These questions were passed on to the president in a letter on 14 July. The questions provoked a variety of reactions in the House. One DPR member, Soedardji, did not agree the president <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> the questions. However, his party colleague Anwar Nuris said it was a normal part of the constitutional process.|$|E

25|$|It {{was further}} stipulated that {{candidates}} should be between 25 and 40 years old, no taller than , {{and hold a}} college degree in a STEM subject. The college degree requirement excluded the USAF's X-1 pilot, then-Lt Col (later Brig Gen) Chuck Yeager, {{the first person to}} exceed the speed of sound. He later became a critic of the project, ridiculing especially the use of monkeys as test subjects. USAF Capt (later Col) Joseph Kittinger, a USAF fighter pilot and stratosphere balloonist, met all the requirements but preferred to stay in his contemporary project. Other potential candidates declined because they did not believe that manned spaceflight had a future beyond Project Mercury. From the original 508, 110 candidates were selected for an interview, and from the interviews, 32 were selected for further physical and mental testing. Their health, vision, and hearing were examined, together with their tolerance to noise, vibrations, g-forces, personal isolation, and heat. In a special chamber, they were tested {{to see if they could}} perform their tasks under confusing conditions. The candidates <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> more than 500 questions about themselves and describe what they saw in different images. Navy Lt (later Capt) Jim Lovell, a NAP who was later an astronaut in the Gemini and Apollo programs, did not pass the physical tests. After these tests it was intended to narrow the group down to six astronauts, but in the end it was decided to keep seven.|$|E
25|$|After this ruling, Anselm {{received}} a letter forbidding his return and withdrew to Lyons to await Paschal's response. On 26 March 1105, Paschal again excommunicated prelates who had accepted investment from Henry and the advisors responsible, this time including Robert de Beaumont, Henry's chief advisor. He further finally threatened Henry with the same; in April, Anselm sent messages to the king directly and through his sister Adela expressing his own willingness to excommunicate Henry. This was probably a negotiation tactic but it came at a critical period in Henry's reign and it worked: a meeting was arranged and a compromise concluded at Laigle on 22 July 1105. Henry would forsake lay investiture if Anselm obtained Paschal's permission for clerics to do homage for their lands; Henry's bishops' and counselors' excommunications were to be lifted provided they advise him to obey the papacy (Anselm performed this act on his own authority and latter <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> for it to Paschal); the revenues of Canterbury would {{be returned to the}} archbishop; and priests would no longer be permitted to marry. Anselm insisted on the agreement's ratification by the pope before he would consent to return to England, but wrote to Paschal in favour of the deal, arguing that Henry's forsaking of lay investiture was a greater victory than the matter of homage. On 23 March 1106, Paschal wrote Anselm accepting the terms established at Laigle, although both clerics saw this as a temporary compromise and intended to continue pressing for reforms, including the ending of homage to lay authorities.|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few years}} of the court's establishment, the American Civil War erupted, and Missouri was placed under martial law. Missouri was a border state with sharply divided loyalties among its citizenry, {{resulting}} in the imposition of stern controls from the Union government, including the imprisonment of large number of Missouri militiamen. When the District, by the hand of Judge Treat, issued a writ of habeas corpus for the release of one of them, Captain Emmett McDonald, Union commanding general William S.

In addition, he had his normal duties of dealing with the legal problems of government departments, and said that the day was [...] "one long rush between the law courts, government departments and the House of Commons". His working hours were regularly between 7am and 5am the following morning, and the policemen on duty at the House of Commons complained to him that he was working too long, since they were required to stay on duty as long as he was.|$|E
500|$|Parker and Stone were in New York {{to attend}} the 65th Tony Awards, when they were {{requested}} for interviews and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions at press junkets regarding the episode. On June 15, 2011, Parker and Stone appeared on The Daily Show with Jon Stewart, where they denied being unhappy with the show and stated that they still enjoy producing episodes. Parker commented that, while the episode did deal with some issues they had with the show, they particularly enjoyed creating [...] "You're Getting Old", and that despite not knowing what upcoming episodes would be about, they would figure it out upon resuming production in August 2011. [...] "Looking back at it, it kinda does look like we’re kinda saying we don't {{want to do this}} anymore, but it's not really what we were saying," [...] said Parker in the episode's DVD commentary.|$|E
500|$|The archaic form of manus {{marriage}} {{in which the}} woman had been subject to her husband's authority was largely abandoned by the Imperial era, and a married woman retained ownership of any property she brought into the marriage. Technically she remained under her father's legal authority, even though she moved into her husband's home, but when her father died she became legally emancipated. This arrangement {{was one of the}} factors in the degree of independence Roman women enjoyed relative to those of many other ancient cultures and up to the modern period: although she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to her father in legal matters, she was free of his direct scrutiny in her daily life, and her husband had no legal power over her. Although it was a point of pride to be a [...] "one-man woman" [...] (univira) who had married only once, there was little stigma attached to divorce, nor to speedy remarriage after the loss of a husband through death or divorce.|$|E

500|$|Journalist James P. O'Donnell, who {{conducted}} extensive interviews in the 1970s, provides one {{account of what}} happened next. SS-Brigadeführer Wilhelm Mohnke, {{who presided over the}} court martial for desertion, told O'Donnell that Hitler ordered him to set up a tribunal. Mohnke arranged for a court martial panel, which consisted of generals Wilhelm Burgdorf, Hans Krebs, SS-Gruppenführer Johann Rattenhuber, and himself. Fegelein, still drunk, refused to accept that he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> to Hitler, and stated that he was responsible only to Himmler. Fegelein was so drunk that he was crying and vomiting; he was unable to stand up, and even urinated on the floor. Mohnke was in a quandary, as German military and civilian law both require a defendant to be of sound mind and to understand the charges against them. Although Mohnke was certain Fegelein was [...] "guilty of flagrant desertion", it was the opinion of the judges that he was in no condition to stand trial, so Mohnke closed the proceedings and turned the defendant over to General Rattenhuber's security squad. Mohnke never saw Fegelein again.|$|E
500|$|Series creator Chris Carter {{felt this}} was one of his {{favorite}} episodes to write, as he found it interesting to explore how the character of Fox Mulder would react to the death of his father. Carter had recently lost a parent himself when he began work on the episode. Frank Spotnitz said of the episode [...] "The expectations were very high coming after a summer's worth of anticipation to see how Mulder got out of the boxcar. We knew we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> that question and still leave an intriguing enough dilemma {{at the end of the}} show to bring viewers back for the third and final part. I also thought it was a big gamble to do all that Indian mysticism stuff. I thought a lot of people would not necessarily respond to that. So I was nervous about that, but very excited about the Scully storyline and the way all of that played out with Mulder and Skinner." [...] Carter attended Navajo chants and rituals to ensure the accuracy of the events in this episode, after being alerted to inaccuracies in the previous episode by Navajo scholars. A sand painter was brought in to create the two sand paintings for the Blessing Way sequence, which took an entire day to create. The scenes set in New Mexico were filmed in the same Vancouver quarry that had been used as a stand-in in the previous episode, [...] "Anasazi", the repainting of which required only minor touch-ups.|$|E
500|$|The housemates {{competed in}} a [...] "task with no name" [...] on Day 87, {{the first day}} of week thirteen. In this task, the Housemates were {{provided}} with several challenges and puzzles but were unaware that they all had to leave the room in order to pass. The housemates passed the task and added £10,000 to the prize fund. The following day, the housemates' previous nominations were shown to the group and Big Brother set them a quiz on what they had seen in order to add money to the prize fund. The group answered 53 of the 60 questions correctly, gaining £5,300 to the winner's prize. A round of nominations took place on this day, which Charlie, Siavash and Sophie refused to participate in. This meant that all of the housemates faced eviction, as David, Lisa and Rodrigo received the most eligible nominations. On Day 89, the housemates were shown the episode of Big Brother which documented Day 50 in the House and were told to re-enact it over a five-hour period. They passed this task, earning a luxury shopping budget. However, in order to view the reconstruction the group had to replicate the music video of [...] "Single Ladies (Put a Ring on It)", a song by Beyoncé Knowles. The group did so, with David portraying Knowles, and were therefore rewarded with a screening of the task after Lisa was evicted with 68.6% of the vote. On Day 91, Charlie, Rodrigo, Sophie and Siavash were instructed to rank themselves in different categories, such as order of selfishness and likelihood to win. David, who was isolated in the Diary Room, <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>answer</b> questions based on their answers. As he answered four of the ten questions correctly, he added £40,000 to the prize fund. This meant that the prize fund was settled at £71,320.|$|E
