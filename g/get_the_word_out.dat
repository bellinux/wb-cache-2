500|$|The Workshop devoted 8% {{of their}} initial budget to {{advertise}} the new show. [...] In what Morrow called [...] "an extensive campaign" [...] that Lesser stated [...] "would demand {{at least as}} much ingenuity as production and research", they promoted the show with educators and the broadcast industry. [...] The Workshop understood that a special effort had to be made to reach their target community because traditional methods of promotion and advertising were not effective with these groups. To <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to their target audience in the inner cities, they hired Evelyn Davis from the Urban League, whom Michael Davis called [...] "remarkable, unsinkable, and indispensable", as the Workshop's first Vice President of Community Relations and head of the Workshop's Community Educational Services (CES) division.|$|E
500|$|In September 2014, Chris was {{the focus}} of a coward punch storyline. During Kyle and Georgia's joint bucks and hen night, Chris was forced to eject a drunk Josh Willis (Harley Bonner) from The Waterhole when he caused a scene. Shortly after, Josh {{returned}} and hit Chris with a coward punch, causing him to fall and hit his head on a rock. Kyle and Georgia found Chris unconscious and he was rushed to hospital in a critical condition. Mason was pleased to be given the storyline, explaining that it was a topical issue in Australia at the time. He said [...] "The whole moral of the story is that one little mistake can have really dire consequences. I like to think that we can use this story to really educate people and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> there that this is something really serious that we're battling against at the moment." [...] Mason thought that Chris might be able to forgive Josh in the future, but it would be [...] "a long process", and he would {{have to deal with the}} fact that his life had changed forever due to the attack first. Mason added that Chris would have difficulties accepting that someone like Josh attacked him.|$|E

2500|$|Lurie {{said that}} Riordan had been {{approached}} about an imprint several years ago, but initially dismissed the idea {{because of his}} heavy workload. Later, he reported back {{that he had been}} [...] "toying with the idea", and was [...] "willing to go forward with a publishing line that was not a brand extension for his own work but a platform for Riordan to bring other great writers to the attention of his vast and loyal audience." [...] She also said that the imprint is planned to launch with two as-yet undetermined books. [...] "The point of making this announcement now is to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about what we’re looking for.” ...|$|E
2500|$|A new group, the Committee for Civic Progress, {{was formed}} to help promote the bond levy. Its members {{included}} 150 business, labor, real estate leaders. The group asked the City Council to send personal letters to their constituents, asking them to support the proposal. [...] All but three council members agreed to do so. The Greater Cleveland Convention and Visitors Bureau also helped. It issued a study in which it claimed that the convention center would generate $24 {{million a year in}} new economic activity, and printed 300,000 leaflets to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> about the study's conclusions. Local radio and television stations donated time to the Committee for Civic Progress so it could run advertisements supporting the proposal.|$|E
2500|$|In early 1983 Albini met Naked Raygun singer Jeff Pezzati through mutual {{friends and}} {{convinced}} him to play bass guitar with Big Black. Pezzati recalled that Albini [...] "knew {{a heck of a}} lot about, right from the start, how to release a record and <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> that you have a record", and that [...] "He jumped at the chance to have a band play his stuff." [...] The two practiced in Pezzati's basement, and one day Naked Raygun guitarist Santiago Durango came downstairs and asked to play along. The trio clicked as a unit, Durango's ability to rework arrangements and tweak sounds helping to refine Albini's song ideas. According to Albini, [...] "He ended up being absolutely crucial to Big Black." ...|$|E

30|$|In this paper, we {{distinguish}} between the terms dissemination and propagation because although they have different meanings, education developers often use them interchangeably. Dissemination is about spreading ideas: <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to potential adopters about trying an innovation, e.g., publishing a paper or posting resources on a website. Propagation, on the other hand, has occurred only when a new teaching strategy is used successfully by non-developing instructors. Propagation requires developing an effective innovation (product) compatible with the needs, interests, and context of potential users; <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to potential users and motivating them to try the innovation; and developing mechanisms to support users {{so that they are}} successful in implementation. One way to frame the difference is that propagation of an educational innovation is the goal and dissemination is one part of reaching that goal.|$|R

2500|$|On Friday morning, September 13, 2013, Patrick Foye, the {{executive}} director of the Port Authority and an appointee of New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, ordered that the lanes be reopened in a strongly worded 7:44 AM e-mail to senior PA officials and staff, including Bill Baroni and David Samson. In the e-mail, Foye called the decision to close the lanes [...] "hasty and ill-advised", said that the decision violated policy and long-standing custom at the PA, and that he believed that closing the lanes [...] "violates Federal Law and the laws of both States." [...] Foye asked his spokesman to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out.</b> Upon learning this, Baroni attempted to prevent any disclosure in order to keep the public in the dark. Additionally, Baroni forwarded the e-mail to Regina Egea, Christie's Director of the authorities unit overseeing the PA, three hours after it was sent by Foye.|$|E

Then the end of the tail he was clutching, being nothing more than a dead branch, suddenly broke away, and the next minute the boy was rolling in the dust of the road, while the horse and its pumpkin-headed rider dashed on and quickly disappeared in the distance.|$|E
60|$|We {{walked on}} with me talking {{as fast as}} I could <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>out.</b> I showed father a giant, bushy {{chestnut}} which was dominating all the trees around it, and told him how it retarded their growth. On the other hand, the other trees were absorbing nutrition from the ground that would have benefited the chestnut.|$|R

"Mr. Crow {{stood the}} abuse {{for quite a}} while without making any back talk, and then he lost his temper, as even the blindest rabbit that ever lived could have seen, for he hopped around first on one foot and then on the other, acting as if he were choking because he couldn't <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>words</b> <b>out</b> fast enough.|$|R
30|$|Propagation {{requires}} {{developing an}} effective innovation (product) {{compatible with the}} needs, interests, and context of potential users; <b>getting</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> to potential users and motivating them to try the innovation; and developing mechanisms to support users {{so that they are}} successful in implementation. A variety of activities that change as a project matures are required to meet these requirements.|$|R
6000|$|A {{week later}} {{there was an}} unusually large party at mess, the depôts were very strong, and some forty {{officers}} sat down; and it being a guest night, four or five civilians were present. Dinner went on without incident until one of the mess waiters asked Wilmington whether he would take sirloin of beef or goose. He replied, [...] "B-b-b-b-beef." [...] There {{happened to be a}} slight lull in the conversation at the moment, and Wilmington's effort to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> made him raise his voice so that it was generally heard.|$|E
6000|$|... "Warden," [...] Oppenheimer had said, [...] "you've bitten {{off more}} than you can chew. It ain't a case of killing Standing. It's a case of killing three men, for as sure as you kill him, sooner or later Morrell and I will <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> and what you have done will be known from one end of California to the other. You've got your choice. You've either got to let up on Standing or kill all three of us. Standing's got your goat. So have I. So has Morrell. You are a stinking coward, and you haven't got the {{backbone}} and guts to carry out the dirty butcher's work you'd like to do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You're awfully articulate, mamma! Now, if Mr. Wetmore were to criticise {{that picture}} he'd draw a circle round {{it in the}} air, {{and look at it}} through that, and tilt his head first on one side and then on the other, and then look at you, as if you were a figure in it, and then {{collapse}} awhile, and moan a little and gasp, 'Isn't your young lady a little too-too--' and then he'd try to <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> of you, and groan and suffer some more; and you'd say, 'She is, rather,' and that would give him courage, and he'd say, 'I don't mean that she's so very--' 'Of course not.' 'You understand?' 'Perfectly. I see it myself, now.' 'Well, then'---and he'd take your pencil and begin to draw--'I should give her a little more--Ah?' 'Yes, I see the difference.'--'You see the difference?' And he'd go off to some one else, and you'd know that you'd been doing the wishy-washiest thing in the world, though he hadn't spoken a word of criticism, and couldn't. But he wouldn't have noticed the expression at all; he'd have shown you where your drawing was bad. He doesn't care for what he calls the literature of a thing; he says that {{will take care of itself}} if the drawing's good. He doesn't like my doing these chic things; but I'm going to keep it up, for I think it's the nearest way to illustrating." ...|$|E

6000|$|It {{is almost}} a {{fortnight}} now that I am domiciled in a medieval villa in the country, {{a mile or two}} from Florence. I cannot speak the language; I am too old not to learn how, also too busy when I am busy, and too indolent when I am not; wherefore some will imagine that I am having a dull time of it. But it is not so. The [...] "help" [...] are all natives; they talk Italian to me, I answer in English; I do not understand them, they do not understand me, consequently no harm is done, and everybody is satisfied. In order to be just and fair, I throw in an Italian word when I have one, and this has a good influence. I <b>get</b> <b>the</b> <b>word</b> <b>out</b> of the morning paper. I have to use it while it is fresh, for I find that Italian words do not keep in this climate. They fade toward night, and next morning they are gone. But it is no matter; I get a new one out of the paper before breakfast, and thrill the domestics with it while it lasts. I have no dictionary, and I do not want one; I can select words by the sound, or by orthographic aspect. Many of them have French or German or English look, and these are the ones I enslave for the day's service. That is, as a rule. Not always. If I find a learnable phrase that has an imposing look and warbles musically along I do not care to know the meaning of it; I pay it out to the first applicant, knowing that if I pronounce it carefully HE will understand it, and that's enough.|$|E
