5|$|If it {{is unclear}} what counts as science, <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of {{confirming}} theories works, and what the purpose of science is, there is considerable scope for values and other social influences to shape science. Indeed, values can play a role ranging from determining which research gets funded to influencing which theories achieve scientific consensus. For example, in the 19th century, cultural values held by scientists about race shaped research on evolution, and values concerning social class influenced debates on phrenology (considered scientific at the time). Feminist philosophers of science, sociologists of science, and others explore how social values affect science.|$|E

25|$|Progressive creationism {{holds that}} species have changed or evolved {{in a process}} {{continuously}} guided by God, with various ideas as to <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> operated—though it is generally taken that God directly intervened in the natural order at key moments in Earth history. This view accepts most of modern physical science including {{the age of the}} Earth, but rejects much of modern evolutionary biology or looks to it for evidence that evolution by natural selection alone is incorrect. Organizations such as Reasons To Believe, founded by Hugh Ross, promote this version of creationism.|$|E

Following several media controversies, West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with. [...] Amongst the various artists invited down to Hawaii to record songs for the album was Pusha T, a rapper known for the hip-hop duo Clipse. While in Hawaii, Pusha-T commented that {{the very first thing}} he recorded was his verse for [...] "So Appalled".

[...] In 1983, Jack Szostak and colleagues presented a model {{now known as the}} DSBR pathway, which accounted for observations not explained by the Holliday model. [...] During the next decade, experiments in Drosophila, budding yeast and mammalian cells led to the emergence of other models of homologous recombination, called SDSA pathways, which do not always rely on Holliday junctions.|$|E
500|$|Daniels {{estimated}} {{the total cost}} of the writing camp to be approximately $200,000, averaging $18,000 for each of the eleven songs which were included on Loud; the camp consisted of forty writers and producers. Daniels confirmed that Rock City received $15,000 and Sham $20,000 for their part in the production of [...] "Man Down". He said that [...] "to get that twelve minutes of inspiration from a top songwriting team is expensive — even before you take into account the fee for the songwriters". A cost of $53,000 for [...] "Man Down" [...] was already incurred prior to Rihanna entering the studio with a vocal producer. Although Makeba Riddick did not serve as the song's vocal producer, Daniels cited her as an example of <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> works and how much she would charge. It {{is the responsibility of the}} vocal producer to tell a singer how to sing the song correctly to achieve the desired sound. Daniels said that Riddick's fee varies from $10,000 to $15,000, and that the final part of the process is for the song to be mixed and mastered, which incurs a similar fee. He {{estimated the}} final cost of writing, producing, vocal producing, mixing and mastering [...] "Man Down" [...] to be $78,000. When combined with the marketing and promotional costs, the total expense was $1,078,000.|$|E

He also told Capital that Daft Punk influenced the album. Speaking about the album title Demonstration, Tinie {{said that it was}} about him compromising to make an album that was both true to where he came from and follows the trappings of mainstream hip hop: [...] "Anyone who wants to take inspiration from it can have a sort of example based on my experiences of how to do this. So basically, do something that still nods to where you've come from, still feels very London, still feels very British, but kind of meets the criteria of what a mainstream record needs." [...] He also commented oh how things change when signing with a record label and <b>how</b> <b>the</b> <b>process</b> of making albums: [...] "The first time around, you don't really know. All you do is you get this record deal and you're like whoa! Like, I'm signed! This is amazing! And you're just recording {{and before you know it}} the album's done. This time around, I had to think about so much more things, you know: edits, production things that I didn't like, going back and forth on mixing.... I was very hands-on this time." ...|$|E
