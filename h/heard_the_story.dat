Adam had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> from King Sweyn II of Denmark. According to some historians, resemblance to later legend about an English-born Henricus, who was allegedly slain and martyred in Finland, is too striking to be a coincidence.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the other}} boys ran {{across the street to}} tell Curtis Jones what {{happened}} in the store. When the older man with whom Jones was playing checkers <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> he urged the boys to leave quickly, fearing violence. Bryant told others of the events at the store, and the story spread quickly. Jones and Till declined to tell his great-uncle Mose Wright, fearing they would get in trouble. Till said he wanted to return home to Chicago. Carolyn's husband Roy Bryant was on an extended trip hauling shrimp to Texas and did not return home until August 27.|$|E
5|$|The museum's founder Sigurður Hjartarson {{worked as}} a teacher and {{principal}} for 37 years, teaching history and Spanish at Reykjavík's Hamrahlid College for the last 26 years before his retirement. As a child, he owned a bull's pizzle, which was given to him to use as a cattle whip. He began collecting penises after a friend <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the bull's penis in 1974 and gave him four new ones, three of which Sigurður gave to friends. Acquaintances at whaling stations began bringing him whale penises as well, and the collection grew from there, expanding through donations and acquisitions from various sources around Iceland.|$|E

25|$|Blair cited {{evidence}} of the historical Jacob Waltz and suggested that additional evidence supports the core elements of the story – that Waltz claimed to have discovered (or at least <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of) a rich gold vein or cache. But Blair suggested that this core story was distorted in subsequent retellings, comparing the many variants of the Lost Dutchman's story to the game of Chinese whispers, where the original account is distorted in multiple retellings of the tale.|$|E
25|$|The {{sinking of}} the ship was a severe blow to Britain during these {{early years of the}} war. When the {{officers}} <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of Lassie and what she did to rescue Cowan, they told it again and again to any reporter who would listen as it was inspirational and heart-warming. In 1938 the novel 'Lassie come home' was published by author Eric Knight and might have been inspired by this tale. Hollywood got hold of the story, and so a star was born.|$|E
25|$|Once more Ibn Battuta {{returned}} to Tangier, but only stayed {{for a short}} while. In 1324, two years before {{his first visit to}} Cairo, the West African Malian Mansa, or king of kings, Musa had passed through the same city on his own hajj and caused a sensation with a display of extravagant riches brought from his gold-rich homeland. Although Ibn Battuta never mentioned this visit specifically, when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> it may have planted a seed in his mind as he then decided to cross the Sahara and visit the Muslim kingdoms on its far side.|$|E

50|$|Charlotte Black Elk {{grew up on}} the Pine Ridge Reservation, in {{the village}} of Manderson, which is where the Crazy Horse faction of the Lakota settled in the late nineteenth-century.

25|$|Next, the {{governor}} sent {{his son to}} Constantinople (Istanbul) {{to meet with the}} Ottoman Sultan Mahmud I. The purpose for the visit was to ask the sultan for a reward for saving Mosul. The sultan issued an official Firman in 1778 and paid Hussein Pasha al-Jalili 800 Qirsh to buy the village of Baghdida. The people of Baghdida were very upset about what had happened. They met and decided after long deliberation to abandon the village. When al-Jalili <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> he felt guilty and decided to return the village to its rightful owners. He issued a decree in 1778, in which he relinquished his ownership to Baghdida, but he kept his rights to receive the tenth of its produce in taxes.|$|E
500|$|Andersen had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> as a child, and {{it likely}} has its source in folk material, {{possibly}} originating from Sweden, {{as it is}} unknown in the Danish oral tradition. Neither [...] "The Princess and the Pea" [...] nor Andersen's other tales of 1835 were well received by Danish critics, who disliked their casual, chatty style and their lack of morals.|$|E
500|$|In his {{preface to}} the second volume of Tales and Stories (1863) Andersen claims to have <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> in his childhood, but the tale {{has never been a}} {{traditional}} one in Denmark. He may as a child have heard a Swedish version, [...] "Princess Who Lay on Seven Peas" [...] ("Princessa' som lå' på sju ärter"), which tells of an orphan girl who establishes her identity after a sympathetic helper (a cat or a dog) informs her that an object (a bean, a pea, or a straw) had been placed under her mattress.|$|E
5000|$|Hillman {{was once}} {{asked by a}} {{reporter}} {{if it was true}} he could jump high enough to grab a quarter {{off the top of the}} backboard.

500|$|The {{legend of}} the [...] is another {{folklore}} story associated with the castle. According to the legend, Toyotomi Hideyoshi ran out of stones when building the original three-story keep, and an old woman heard about his trouble. She gave him her hand millstone even though she needed it for her trade. It was said that people who <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> were inspired and also offered stones to Hideyoshi, speeding up construction of the castle. To this day, the supposed stone can be seen covered with a wire net {{in the middle of}} one of the stone walls in the castle complex.|$|E
500|$|Initially, {{some writers}} {{confused}} {{the name of}} the woman who played such an important role at Apple River Fort; a 1900 collection from the Wisconsin Historical Society misidentified her as [...] "Mrs. Graham." [...] Several years after the fight, an itinerant Methodist minister <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the Apple River Fort fight from a [...] "Mr. Jewel," [...] a man who settled in Jo Daveiss County well after the Black Hawk War. Jewel described Armstrong as [...] "cursing & swearing like a pirate" [...] throughout the battle; so angry that even Black Hawk's warriors purported to hear her. The Methodist minister pronounced such action as [...] "profane" [...] and [...] "a great drawback upon her credit." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{bridge is}} {{mentioned}} in the Prose Edda books Gylfaginning and Skáldskaparmál, where it {{is referred to as}} Bifröst. In chapter 13 of Gylfaginning, Gangleri (King Gylfi in disguise) asks the enthroned figure of High what way exists between heaven and earth. Laughing, High replies that the question isn't an intelligent one, and goes on to explain that the gods built a bridge from heaven and earth. He incredulously asks Gangleri if he has not <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> before. High says that Gangleri must have seen it, and notes that Gangleri may call it a rainbow. High says that the bridge consists of three colors, has great strength, [...] "and is built with art and skill {{to a greater extent than}} other constructions." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{idea for}} the novel came in 1959, when Achebe <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of a Chief Priest being imprisoned by a District Officer. He drew further {{inspiration}} a year later when he viewed a collection of Igbo objects excavated from the area by archaeologist Thurstan Shaw; Achebe was startled by the cultural sophistication of the artifacts. When an acquaintance showed him a series of papers from colonial officers (not unlike the fictional Pacification of the Primitive Tribes of the Lower Niger referenced {{at the end of}} Things Fall Apart), Achebe combined these strands of history and began work on Arrow of God in earnest. Like Achebe's previous works, Arrow was roundly praised by critics. A revised edition was published in 1974 to correct what Achebe called [...] "certain structural weaknesses".|$|E
500|$|According to {{a literal}} {{interpretation}} of Einar Haugen's {{translation of the}} two sagas in the book Voyages to Vinland, Leif {{was not the first}} European to discover America: he had <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of merchant Bjarni Herjólfsson who claimed to have sighted land to the west of Greenland after having been blown off course. Bjarni reportedly never made landfall there, however. Later, when travelling from Norway to Greenland, Leif was also blown off course, to a land that he did not expect to see, where he found [...] "self-sown wheat fields and grapevines". He next rescued two men who were shipwrecked in this country and went back to Greenland (and Christianised the people there). Consequently, if this is to be trusted, Bjarni Herjólfsson was the first European to see America beyond Greenland, and the two unnamed shipwrecked men were the first people known to Europeans to have made landfall there.|$|E
500|$|Based on a {{short story}} Kaksparsh written by Usha Datar, a Marathi play Janmagaath premiered on 16 December 1989. Actor-director Vinay Apte had done the role of Hari Damle in the play and Sukanya Kulkarni as Uma. Apte had tried making a film based on the story but was not successful. Sachin Khedekar had seen the play and came across the story again in 2007. He showed the story to Girish Joshi (screenplay writer of the film) who then {{developed}} a complete adapted screenplay from the story which had a length of 4–5 pages. Later, Khedekar and Joshi approached Mahesh Manjrekar in 2009 {{to make a film}} on the story. However, Majrekar was busy with his other projects and could not plan the film. Manjrekar said that when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> for the first time, he considered it to be better than other Indian love stories like Bajirao-Mastani or Salim-Anarkali. Manjrekar had to wait as {{he did not have the}} copyrights for the story. He said that it [...] "took more than three years to make this film".|$|E

6000|$|I was {{attentive}} {{to all the}} ladies, and scandalous tongues gave me half a dozen mistresses, with details of the siege and capture. I wondered whether <b>the</b> amiable Giulia <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories,</b> and {{what she thought of}} them. Occasionally I saw her, but I did not trouble to speak to her; Forli was large enough for the two of us; and when people are disagreeable why should you trouble your head about them? ...|$|R
500|$|This {{silence was}} an {{exception}} to the practice of oral history among black families. Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents. She kept the story from her children for 60 years: [...] "I didn't want them to know what I came through and I didn't discuss it with none of them... I just didn't want them to know what kind of way I come up. I didn't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes." [...] Decades passed before she began to trust white people. Some families spoke of Rosewood, but forbade the stories from being told: Arnett Doctor <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> from his mother, Philomena Goins Doctor, who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted, and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier. She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas. Doctor was consumed by his mother's story; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it.|$|E
500|$|M. G. Ramachandran {{was cast}} in the title role, this being the final film of his three-film {{contract}} with Modern Theatres, following Manthiri Kumari (1950) and Sarvadhikari (1951). He was paid [...] for acting in the film. The screenplay was written {{in a way that}} would suit his then [...] "swashbucking" [...] image, as opposed to the original story where Ali Baba was a [...] "gullible simpleton". P. S. Veerappa was cast as Abu Hussain, the leader of the forty thieves. Padmini was initially given the role of the female lead Marziana, but she was replaced subsequently by Bhanumathi Ramakrishna. Bhanumathi liked the film, one of her earliest in Tamil, because she found the character a [...] "go-getter". In her autobiography, Bhanumathi noted that after she <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story,</b> she considered her role to be much better than that in Missamma (1955), from which she was fired after filming only four reels, adding that after she accepted to work on this film, she got more acting offers from Tamil film producers.|$|E
500|$|Marilyn Aronberg Lavin {{states that}} Villani {{was most likely}} serving as a Peruzzi {{representative}} in Flanders when he <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of the French Jew who in 1290 tried to destroy Host bread (of the Eucharist) but was unsuccessful as the bread allegedly bled profusely as he stabbed it, and turned into flesh as he attempted to boil it in water. In the original account by the Ghent monk Jean de Thilrode in 1294, the Jew was compelled to convert to Christianity, but Villani's account followed that of the later Chronicles of Saint-Denis (1285–1328) which told that the Jew was burned to death for his crime. Villani's Cronica marks the first appearance in Italian literature of this legend, while [...] "Villani's report includes details which establish an independent Italian branch of the tradition" [...] according to Lavin. St. Antoninus, archbishop of Florence, repeated the story of Villani in his Latin Chronicles, while Villani's illustrated Cronica featured a scene of this French Jew that later appeared in a painting by Paolo Uccello.|$|E

50|$|Four works, or {{collections}} of works, {{have been attributed}} to Marie de France. She is principally known for her authorship of The Lais of Marie de France, a collection of twelve narrative poems, mostly of a few hundred lines each. She claims in the preambles to most of these Breton lais that she has <b>heard</b> <b>the</b> <b>stories</b> they contain from Breton minstrels, and it is in the opening lines of the poem Guigemar that she first reveals her name to be Marie.|$|R
