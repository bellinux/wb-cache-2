40|$|Objectives. To assess daily {{variations}} in ambulance calls for cardiovascular diseases (CVDs), mental and behavioral disorders, and external causes in Arkhangelsk, Northwest Russia, in 2000 &#x 2013; 2008. Study design. A population-based study. Methods. Data about all ambulance calls {{during the years}} 2000 &#x 2013; 2008 {{were obtained from the}} Arkhangelsk ambulance station. Information about patient&#x 0027;s gender, age, doctor&#x 0027;s diagnosis according to International Classification of Diseases, 10 th revision, and the <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>call</b> were recorded. Pearson&#x 0027;s Chi-squared tests were used for comparing proportions of ambulance calls across the week for CVDs (I 00 - 99), mental and behavioral disorders (F 00 -F 99), and external causes (S 00 -T 98, V 01 -Y 98). The ratio of incidence of ambulance calls on Saturday, Sunday, and Monday versus the rest of week was also calculated. Results. There is a significant daily variation (p &# 60;&#x 200 A; 0. 001) in calls for CVDs in men and women aged 18 &#x 2013; 59 and women aged 60 years and older, with increased numbers of calls on weekends and Mondays varying between 2 and 3 % excess calls. For mental and behavioral disorders, a similar pattern was found in the age group of 18 &#x 2013; 59 year-olds. Ratios for the number of calls during weekends and Mondays vs. {{the rest of the week}} were 1. 05 (95 % CI: 1. 02 &#x 2013; 1. 08) among women and 1. 02 (95 % CI: 1. 00 &#x 2013; 1. 05) among men. For external causes, a significant variation and an increase in ambulance calls during Saturdays, Sundays, and Mondays from 4 to 17 % excess calls was observed for both age and gender groups. Conclusions. The observed daily {{variations in}} ambulance calls with an increased number of calls on weekends and Mondays for CVDs, mental and behavioral disorders, and external causes may be associated with excessive alcohol consumption on the weekends. Further research using data on individual levels of alcohol consumption are warranted...|$|E
40|$|Telephone {{healthcare}} {{systems have}} been put forward as a key strategy to overcome geographical disadvantage, however, evidence has suggested that usage decreases with increasing rurality. This research aimed to identify geographical high and low areas of usage of NHS Direct, a leading telephone healthcare provider worldwide to determine if usage is influenced by rurality. National call data was collected (January, 2011) from the NHS Direct Clinical Assessment System for all 0845 4647 calls in England, UK (N= 360, 137). Data extracted for analysis included; unit postcode of patient, type of call, <b>date</b> <b>of</b> <b>call,</b> time of call and final disposition. Calls were mapped using GIS mapping software using full postcode, aggregated by population estimate by local authority to determine confidence intervals across two thresholds by call rate. Uptake rate Output Area Classification (OAC) group profiles was performed using the chi-square goodness of fit. The majority of calls were ‘symptomatic’ (N= 280, 055; 74. 8 %) i. e. calls that were triaged by an expert nurse, with the remaining 25. 2 % of calls health/ medicine information only (N= 94, 430). NHS Direct were able to manage through self-care advice and health information 43. 5 of all calls made (N= 99, 367) with no onward referral needed. Geographical pattern of calls were highest for more urbanised areas with significant higher call usage found in larger cities. Lower observed usage was found {{in areas that are}} more rural of which were characterised by above average older populations. This was supported by geo-segmentation, which highlighted that rural and older communities had the lowest expected uptake rate. There is a variation of usage of NHS Direct relating to rurality, which suggests that this type of service has not been successful in reducing accessible barriers. However, geographical variations are likely to be influenced by age. There is a need for exploratory to determine the underlying factors that contribute to variation in uptake of these services particularly older people who reside in rural communities. This will have worldwide implications as to how telephone based healthcare is introduced...|$|E
