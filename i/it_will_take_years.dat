The Okemah Ledger took the view that [...] "while the general {{sentiment}} is adverse to the method, it is generally thought that the negroes got {{what would have been}} due them under due process of law." ...|$|E
2500|$|SWANCCs {{implications}} for {{the scope of the}} federal wetlands permitting program are certain to be significant, but <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> of litigation before they are fully clear. A key source of confusion is the aforementioned disconnect between the decision's narrow holding and broad rationale. The latter appears to preclude any effort by the Corps to assert jurisdiction over isolated waters, including isolated wetlands, on the basis of linkages with interstate commerce other than the interstate flight of migratory birds. (The Corps asserted such non-migratory-bird linkages after the litigation commenced, noting that SWANCCs municipal landfill is clearly of a commercial nature and, when aggregated with similar activity elsewhere, would substantially affect interstate commerce. The Supreme Court declined to consider this argument, pointing out that landfill activity is a [...] "far cry" [...] from the [...] "waters of the United States" [...] to which the CWA extends.) Plainly, the degree of section 404 program contraction occasioned by SWANCC will depend on which aspects of the decision shape the government's response.|$|E

And it makes me tender, sore-minded about everything. It will go, of course, in the long run, and it's just like any other ache that lays hold of one. One can't cure it.

"In {{the first}} place," [...] he said, [...] "mixed {{up with the}} Ternate people are all the natives of this island, and to exterminate them would be to leave us without labor, and to ruin the island.

If you had seen, as I did, seven or eight {{thousand}} men running like a flock of frightened sheep, you would agree with me that it would be hopeless to think of breaking through the Germans with such troops as this. One victory would make all the difference in the world to their morale, but they will never win that one victory, and <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> before the French soldier regains his old confidence in himself.

60|$|Apart {{from food}} however, when one {{considers}} the transports we have needed, their convoys, the double handling of cargo, the interruptions of traffic from submarines or bad weather, the danger and suffering of the wounded, and all else that we owe to the insane opposition to the Channel tunnels, one questions whether there has ever been an example of national stupidity being so rapidly and heavily punished. It is as clear as daylight even now, that <b>it</b> <b>will</b> <b>take</b> <b>years</b> to recover all our men and material from France, and that if the tunnel (one will suffice for the time), were at once set in hand, it might be ready to help in this task and so free shipping {{for the return of}} the Americans. One thing however, is clear. It is far too big and responsible and lucrative an undertaking for a private company, and it should be carried out and controlled by Government, the proceeds being used towards the war debt.|$|E
