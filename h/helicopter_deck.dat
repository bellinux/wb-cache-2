25|$|A <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> {{was added}} aft in 1979 by Hatch and Kirk, Inc. It could {{accommodate}} a MBB Bo 105C helicopter {{used by the}} Philippine Navy for utility, scout, and maritime patrol purposes, although the ship had no capability to refuel or otherwise support visiting helicopters.|$|E
25|$|It was {{initially}} armed with light and medium machine guns. In 2000, self-defence capability was added by installing new close-in weapons like anti-aircraft and anti-missile guns and missiles. This {{was done to}} enhance the survivability of the ship during surface warfare operations on India's western seaboard. It also has a <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck.</b>|$|E

50|$|Marine and {{offshore}} <b>helicopter</b> <b>decks</b> on board offshore oil platforms and ships are typically {{regulated by the}} rules defined within CAP 437, which defines standards for the design, marking, and lighting of marine/offshore <b>helicopter</b> <b>decks,</b> and is produced by the Civil Aviation Authority. The largest marine heli decks will accommodate the Boeing CH-47 Chinook, which requires a D value of 30 m, and has a weight of 21.3 tons. More typical for vessels would be decks that will accommodate the Sikorsky S92 with a D value of 21 m and 11.9 tons.|$|R
25|$|Emergency {{procedures}} instructed {{personnel to}} make their way to lifeboat stations, but the fire prevented them from doing so. Instead many of the men moved to the fireproofed accommodation block beneath the <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> to await further instructions. Wind, fire and smoke prevented helicopter landings and no further instructions were given, with smoke beginning to seep into the personnel block.|$|E
25|$|In May 1947, 705 Squadron was re-commissioned at RNAS Gosport {{with the}} Sikorsky Hoverfly element from 771 NAS. At first the {{squadron}} operated as a fleet requirements unit, and {{was responsible for}} the evaluation of the helicopter for use at sea. On 1 February 1947 Lieutenant K Reed carried out the first <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> landing on a Royal Navy ship when he landed on HMS Vanguard off Portland.|$|E
25|$|The {{class has}} been criticised in Parliamentary {{evidence}} for: lacking a helicopter hangar (even a telescopic hangar), {{something that will}} limit utility of the <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> by preventing embarkation of a helicopter for anything other than very short periods; lacking a medium calibre gun (such as 76mm); and poor value for money. It is argued {{that because of the}} lacking features (which could have been incorporated for the price) the vessels will not be as capable in the ocean-going patrol capacity as claimed.|$|E

In the year 2000 the missile was test-fired from INS Subhadra (a Sukanya class patrol craft). INS Subhadra was modified for the test and the missile was launched from the reinforced <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck.</b> The results were considered partially successful. In 2004, the missile was again tested from INS Subhadra {{and this time the}} results were reported successful. In December 2005 the missile was tested again, but this time from the destroyer INS Rajput. The test was a success with the missile hitting the land based target.|$|E
25|$|Kanimbla {{sailed to}} Australia in October, after {{training}} and maintenance checks were completed. Kanimbla and Manoora were docked at Forgacs Dockyard in Newcastle, New South Wales, where they underwent conversion from tank landing ships to amphibious warfare transports. The conversion required the bow ramp {{to be removed}} and the bow doors welded shut. A hangar for three Sea King or four Blackhawk helicopters was added, while the aft <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> was reinforced. Chinook helicopters are able to land and take off from the aft deck, but cannot be carried long-term. The deck forward of the superstructure was converted to carry two LCM-8 landing craft, which are launched and recovered by a single 70ton crane. When the LCM-8s are deployed, the area functions as a third helicopter landing spot. Accommodation was provided for up to 450 soldiers, while improved medical facilities and an upgraded galley were also installed.|$|E
500|$|Good Hope and {{her sisters}} Natal and [...] repatriated some 700 troops from Egypt between November 1945 and March 1946 and escorted the {{battleship}} [...] while it was serving as the royal yacht during King George VI's tour of South Africa in 1947. All three sisters toured ports in Portuguese West Africa and the Belgian Congo in August–September 1948. Upon their return, Good Hope was reduced to reserve at Salisbury Island, Durban. In mid-1954 the ship began conversion into a despatch vessel in Durban and it was recommissioned on 3 June 1955 as the flagship of the South African Navy. Later that year, it conveyed the Governor General of South Africa, Ernest George Jansen, on a goodwill visit to French Madagascar. The following year, it took the navy's Chief of Staff, Rear Admiral Hugo Biermann, to Portuguese Mozambique. That same year, a South African Air Force Sikorsky S-55 helicopter landed aboard, the first <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> landing aboard a South African warship. The ship was refitted in Simon's Town in early 1958 and transported Biermann to Portuguese West Africa and the Belgian Congo in August 1959. As part of this trip, it sailed some [...] up the Congo River to Matadi. During the early 1960s, Good Hope was assigned fishery protection duties {{in addition to her}} normal training tasks. The ship was paid off in September 1965 and was sold for R6,500, together with her sister Transvaal, in 1977. After stripping it of all valuable metals and fittings, Good Hopes hulk was donated to the False Bay Conservation Society for use as an artificial reef. She was scuttled in False Bay on 12 December 1978.|$|E
50|$|The ships {{had both}} {{bow and stern}} doors leading onto the main vehicle deck, making them roll-on/roll-off, {{combined}} with ramps that led to upper and lower vehicle decks. Thanks to their shallow draught, they could beach themselves and use the bow doors for speedy unloading of troops and equipment. The ships also had <b>helicopter</b> <b>decks</b> on both the upper vehicle deck and behind the superstructure.|$|R

2500|$|In 1950 {{the ship}} {{received}} a comprehensive refit {{in preparation for}} service as Japan's first dedicated Antarctic research ship. In 1956 further modifications included the replacement of her steam engine with twin diesel engines and the installation of a <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> {{with the ability to}} store light helicopters for voyage. In 1957 her forward gunwale was built up and 1958 a further refit added a second, larger <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> above the earlier one, which became a vast new storage space. Between 1956 and 1962 Sōya undertook missions to the Antarctic. [...] Her second voyage, in 1958, made headlines worldwide when she rescued personnel stranded at the Showa research station in the face of approaching winter. The evacuation did not extend to the mission's dogs, and 15 Karafuto-Ken huskies were abandoned to fend for themselves on the ice. The following spring the ship returned to find two dogs still alive. The mutts, named Taro and Jiro, became bywords in Japan for fortitude. The story travelled worldwide thanks in part to two movies: Nankyoku Monogatari (lit. [...] "South Pole Story"; released in the U.S. as Antarctica) and a treatment by Disney in the Hollywood film Eight Below. Sōya herself experienced hardship during her time in the Antarctic, including becoming stuck in the ice and needing assistance from the nearby Russian icebreaker Ob.|$|E

The Treasure Finder semi-submersible accommodation platform supported {{a number of}} offshore oil rigs and normally carried a group of four Bell 212 support helicopters for inter-rig transfers of passengers and freight and medical evacuation. Treasure Finder was also the location of hospital facilities servicing the Brent oilfield. On 14 September 1982, a crewman on the Baffin Seal seismic survey vessel suffered an injury and the captain placed a request for medical assistance to the Treasure Finder. [...] The Baffin Seals <b>helicopter</b> <b>deck</b> was obstructed so the rescue helicopter {{would not be able}} to land on the vessel but instead would have to winch the casualty aboard.

In transportation, the low density {{of aluminium}}, resulting in a high strength-to-weight ratio, makes it a favourable material for aircraft, high speed trains and ferries. In building and civil engineering, low density is sometimes the determining factor in the choice of aluminium; e. g. movable bridges, <b>helicopter</b> <b>decks</b> on offshore platforms, etc. However, other favourable properties such as corrosion resistance, easy shaping of profiles by extrusion, and aesthetics are often more important.
