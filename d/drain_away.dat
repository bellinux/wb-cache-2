5|$|Set in the 24th century, {{the series}} follows {{the adventures of}} {{the crew of the}} Starfleet {{starship}} Enterprise-D. In this episode, the Enterprise pursue a Ferengi starship to the planet Gamma Tauri IV, where both ships are disabled by an unknown power <b>drain.</b> <b>Away</b> teams from each vessel beam down to the planet where they find an automated system left behind by the Tkon Empire.|$|E
5|$|There are {{a number}} of items {{scattered}} around the castle, of which the player may carry up to three at a time. Some of these are always in the same place {{at the start of the}} game, whereas others are distributed randomly. Items include differently-coloured keys which will unlock their respective doors, the three pieces of the ACG key, and other items that affect certain enemies or are mere red herrings. Common enemies appear in each room upon entering and will attack the player on sight. Collision with these enemies destroys them but drains a portion of the player's health. There are also stationary poisonous fungi which will drain health constantly if the player is in contact with them, and enemies that require special items in order to either distract, repel or kill them, otherwise they remain invulnerable to conventional attacks. Bosses guard pieces of the ACG key, and contact with them will rapidly <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> the player's health.|$|E
25|$|In 1904 {{a second}} water pocket was {{discovered}} within the glacier, and a hole was drilled to <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> 22,000 cubic metres.|$|E
5000|$|It is {{essentially}} a grate, which allows excess and waste liquids to be <b>drained</b> <b>away,</b> and either collected in a pan under the grate, or <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> through a hose that carries the waste water and tea to a bucket or other drain.|$|R
50|$|Llanmaes Brook {{flows through}} the heart of the village before bending East and <b>draining</b> <b>away</b> towards Eglwys Brewis.|$|R
50|$|In July 2007 {{the river}} flooded the Liberty Way pitch, forcing Nuneaton Town and Nuneaton RFC to cancel matches while the river water <b>drained</b> <b>away.</b>|$|R
25|$|On 10 January 2004, {{five weeks}} after opening, a short {{section of the}} road near Sutton Coldfield was reduced to one lane to allow for repairs to an uneven surface. On 19 January work also began on a {{separate}} stretch near Langley Mill, to deal with heavy rainwater failing to <b>drain</b> <b>away.</b>|$|E
25|$|Frying pans, frypans or skillets {{provide a}} large flat heating surface and shallow sides, and {{are best for}} pan frying. Frypans with a gentle, rolling slope are {{sometimes}} called omelette pans. Grill pans are frypans that are ribbed, to let fat <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> from the food being cooked. Frypans and grill pans are generally sized by diameter (20–30cm).|$|E
25|$|The {{presence}} of ground permafrost {{is important to}} the persistence of some lakes. According to research published in the journal Science ("Disappearing Arctic Lakes", June 2005), thawing permafrost may explain the shrinking or disappearance of hundreds of large Arctic lakes across western Siberia. The idea here is that rising air and soil temperatures thaw permafrost, allowing the lakes to <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> into the ground.|$|E
50|$|The water {{removed by}} the OWS flows to oil {{collecting}} spaces. There can be two stages. The first-stage filter removes physical impurities present and promotes some fine separation. The second-stage filter uses coalescer inserts {{to achieve the}} final de-oiling. Coalescence is the breakdown of surface tension between oil droplets in an oil/water mixture which causes them to join and increase in size. The oil from the collecting spaces is <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> automatically or manually. In most modern ships, the oil from collecting spaces is <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> automatically.|$|R
50|$|The {{title is}} based on a real Icelandic lake Kleifarvatn, which began <b>draining</b> <b>away</b> in 2000 {{following}} an earthquake. In the novel, the dropping water level reveals a body long hidden in the lake.|$|R
5000|$|The name Lad Vampire {{is derived}} from the slang term for Nigerian {{fraudsters}} i.e. [...] "The Lads from Lagos" [...] and the term [...] "Vampire" [...] refers {{to the fact that the}} program <b>drains</b> <b>away</b> the target's bandwidth.|$|R
25|$|Cryo-arithmetic {{engines are}} a {{specific}} class of quantum computer {{discovered by the}} Conjoiners. When certain algorithms are executed on processors of this architecture, it leads to a local violation of the Second law of thermodynamics: the computer gets colder instead of hotter. Consequently, cryo-arithmetic engines have massive industrial (as opposed to computational) ramifications for Conjoiner manufacturing; such engines abound in Conjoiner asteroid factories, where their calculations can <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> the heat of starship construction.|$|E
25|$|The {{economic}} {{situation at the}} time that TV was established in Australia exerted a pivotal influence on the foundation and subsequent history of the industry. When {{the decision was made to}} go ahead with granting the first licences for broadcast TV in the early 1950s, Australia was in a recession, with severe shortages of labour and materials and an underdeveloped heavy industrial base, and in this context TV was seen as a <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> from more fundamental projects.|$|E
25|$|Following {{the initial}} run of 36 Scout C airframes, later Scout C {{production}} batches, consisting of 50 aircraft {{built for the}} RNAS and 75 for the RFC, changed the cowl to a flat-fronted shorter-depth version able to house either the Gnome Lambda rotary, or the alternate choice of a nine-cylinder 80hp Le Rhône 9C rotary engine when the Gnome Lambda was not used, and moved the oil tank forward to a position {{in front of the}} pilot for better weight distribution and more reliable engine operation. The later cowl for the remaining Scout C aircraft still had the small opening of the domed unit, with both cowl designs having a circumferential slot-style cutaway made at mid-cowl depth of about one-sixth the circumference, to the lowest perimeter of the cowl to increase the cooling effect, and to allow any unburned fuel/oil mix to <b>drain</b> <b>away.</b> A total of some 161 Scout C airframes were produced for the British military as a whole, with the transition to the Scout D standard taking place in a gradual progression of feature changes.|$|E
6000|$|... "I say, Ralph," [...] whispered Jack faintly, [...] "do look to my {{wounds and}} {{see that they are}} all tightly bound up. I can't afford to lose another drop of blood. It's almost all <b>drained</b> <b>away,</b> I believe." ...|$|R
50|$|On May 3, 2005, a {{debris flow}} was {{observed}} in webcam images, {{as well as by}} a nearby pilot. A subsequent overflight revealed that much of the sitting pond within the melt hole had <b>drained</b> <b>away,</b> a notable depth.|$|R
25|$|Jefferson Park in North Tacoma is the {{location}} of a new sprayground, an area designed to be a safe and unique play area where water is sprayed from structures or ground sprays and then <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> before it can accumulate.|$|R
500|$|After {{the king}} withdrew, the exultant crowd {{would not be}} denied the same accord from the queen, and her {{presence}} was demanded loudly. Lafayette {{brought her to the}} same balcony, accompanied by her young son and daughter. The crowd ominously shouted for the children to be taken away, and it seemed the stage might be set for a regicide. Yet, as the queen stood with her hands crossed over her chest, the crowd – some of whom had muskets leveled in her direction – warmed to her courage. Amid this unlikely development, Lafayette cannily let the mob's fury <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> until, with dramatic timing and flair, he knelt reverently and kissed her hand. The demonstrators responded with a muted respect, and many even raised a cheer which the queen had not heard for quite a long time: [...] "Vive la Reine!" ...|$|E
500|$|An {{investigation}} by the Brazilian Public Safety Ministry released in November 2008 concluded that the pilots mistakenly left the lever for the right engine to climb upon landing, due to a mistake in landing procedures with the right thrust reverser being disabled from a prior maintenance, when {{in fact it was}} necessary to retard both engines in order for the spoilers to work. They also said that the National Civil Aviation Agency should have closed the airport on the night the plane landed because of heavy rains; that Congonhas airport authorities shared the blame because its runway had not been properly constructed with grooves to <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> excess rainwater, contributing to the crash; [...] that the plane's manufacturer, Airbus, should have provided alarms warning the pilots that the braking system was failing; and that TAM failed to properly train its pilots, who did not act correctly in the emergency.|$|E
500|$|The {{money is}} divided into three unequal shares. The [...] "A" [...] share is 60% of the team's bank; the [...] "B" [...] share is 30%; the [...] "C" [...] share is 10%. The team has 100 seconds to agree on who should receive which share. Once the clock starts, the money begins to <b>drain</b> <b>away.</b> Each {{contestant}} must claim a different share, and the team must lock it in to stop the clock and claim the remaining money. If after 50 seconds, no agreement is made, the clock stops briefly, and each contestant, in turn, is given 10 seconds to explain which share they feel they deserve and why. Once each player has pleaded their case, the clock restarts and the money continues to drain. If no agreement is reached, all three contestants leave the show with no money. If all questions are answered correctly, the top prize is worth up to $51,000 (60% of the maximum total bank of $85,000).|$|E
50|$|A stream, {{known as}} The Leam, once flowed from March to Wisbech, past the church, {{and through the}} village. This stream has now been <b>drained</b> <b>away,</b> and only survives today as a pond {{to the south of}} Elm, at Friday Bridge.|$|R
50|$|Jefferson Park in North Tacoma is the {{location}} of a new sprayground, an area designed to be a safe and unique play area where water is sprayed from structures or ground sprays and then <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> before it can accumulate.|$|R
50|$|In 2011 {{water levels}} within the glacier were {{predicted}} to refill the glacial cavity before summer, and a further 25,000 cubic metres of water was <b>drained</b> <b>away.</b> Further research {{was carried out}} to study and monitor {{the origin of the}} water.|$|R
2500|$|In 1654, Town Meeting {{voted to}} dig a 4000' ditch {{connecting}} the Charles River {{at either end of}} its great loop. [...] Doing so created an island, today the neighborhood of Riverdale, and allowed the [...] "Broad meadow" [...] that was then there to more easily <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> the flood waters that gathered every spring.|$|E
2500|$|In the Industrial Revolution, John Loudon McAdam (1756–1836) {{designed}} {{the first modern}} highways, using inexpensive paving material of soil and stone aggregate (macadam), and he embanked roads a few feet higher than the surrounding terrain to cause water to <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> from the surface. [...] With the development of motor transport there was an increased need for hard-topped roads to reduce washaways, bogging and dust on both urban and rural roads, originally using cobblestones and wooden paving in major western cities {{and in the early}} 20th century tar-bound macadam (tarmac) and concrete paving were extended into the countryside.|$|E
2500|$|The Red River {{forms the}} border between Minnesota and North Dakota. A few sets of [...] "sister cities" [...] {{developed}} along {{opposite sides of the}} river. Grand Forks, North Dakota and its counterpart East Grand Forks, Minnesota, were the pair most severely affected by the 1997 flood. Fargo, North Dakota/Moorhead, Minnesota (Fargo-Moorhead) and Wahpeton, North Dakota/Breckenridge, Minnesota also had severe flooding. Much of the flooding accumulated {{not only because of the}} rising river levels, but also from overland flooding, as meltwater did not <b>drain</b> <b>away.</b> Temporary dikes were erected along the riverfront and around the edges of towns, but were sometimes overwhelmed.|$|E
50|$|Even {{before the}} Franco-Prussian War, Pius IX had {{foreseen}} the temporal {{power of the}} Church <b>draining</b> <b>away</b> and had begun redefining the Catholic Church as a spiritual power that {{would serve as a}} firm bulwark against the liberal trends of the period.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{colonization}} of land, soil, {{a combination of}} mineral particles and decomposed organic matter, did not exist. Land surfaces would have been either bare rock or unstable sand produced by weathering. Water and any nutrients in it would have <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> very quickly.|$|R
50|$|During Cenozoic a large lake {{existed at}} this site (as a remnant of an older sea). During the last Ice Age the lake <b>drained</b> <b>away,</b> leaving only a peat bog. Between 1366 and 1367 Charles IV ordered a large pond to be {{established}} here.|$|R
2500|$|Corrigan {{claimed to}} have noticed his [...] "error" [...] after flying for about 26 hours. This is not entirely {{consistent}} with his claim that after 10 hours, he felt his feet go cold; the cockpit floor was awash with gasoline leaking from the unrepaired tank. He used a screwdriver to punch a hole through the cockpit floor so that the fuel would <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> on the side opposite the hot exhaust pipe, {{reducing the risk of}} a midair explosion. Had he been truly unaware he was over ocean, it seems likely he would have descended at this point; instead, he {{claimed to have}} increased the engine speed by almost 20% in the hope of decreasing his flight time.|$|E
2500|$|Farmyard manure {{is among}} the best all-round soil fertilisers. [...] Urine {{contains}} about half the nitrogen {{and most of the}} potash that an animal voids, but tends to <b>drain</b> <b>away,</b> making it both the richest and the most easily lost element of manure. Dung contains {{the other half of the}} nitrogen and most of the phosphoric acid and lime. [...] With dung, much of the nitrogen is lost in storage or locked up in slowly released forms, so greater quantities are necessary compared to artificial fertilisers. [...] Manure is most effective when ploughed into the fields while it is still fresh, but this is not practical while crops are growing and in practice, most manure is stored and then applied in winter, or else added in ridges for root crops.|$|E
2500|$|The E.S.1 first flew in August 1915, and {{was found}} to be {{extremely}} fast (a speed of 118mph (190km/h) was claimed by Vickers), and being capable of gaining height on a loop. [...] Following operational trials in France, it was fitted with a modified cowling to allow fuel to <b>drain</b> <b>away</b> from the engine, and was armed with a forward-firing Vickers machine gun with the Vickers-Challenger gun synchroniser allowing the gun to fire through the propeller disc. A further two aircraft were built, powered by a [...] Clerget or Le Rhône engine. These aircraft had a modified fuselage and a large cutout in the upper wing to improve the view for the pilot, and were designated Vickers E.S.1 Mark II. No further production followed, with the aircraft being noted as being tiring to fly and difficult to land, although it did form the basis for the Vickers F.B.19.|$|E
50|$|The {{vineyard}} {{was planted}} on a Kimmeridgian marly plateau, {{hanging over the}} Cher River. It is covered by a mixture of alluvium silica-clay soil. This mixture <b>drains</b> <b>away</b> the excess water and the in-depth marl cover preserves water, protecting it from a dry period.|$|R
50|$|According to Swayambhu Purana and legend, Kathmandu Valley {{was once}} a lake. It is {{believed}} that the goddess Manjushree cut a gorge {{at a place called}} Chobhar Gorge, near Chobhar Ancient Hill Village (sp. also Chovar, chobar) and <b>drained</b> <b>away</b> the waters to establish a habitable land.|$|R
