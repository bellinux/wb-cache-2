5|$|In {{a medical}} clinic, a nurse escapes to the shops from a room, locking it just before someone inside can rape her. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> {{a group of}} people are screaming, panicking and self-mutilating; one man—Frank Black (Lance Henriksen)—begins {{pounding}} on a reinforced glass window until his fists bleed.|$|E
5|$|Next, riders board an enchanted bench <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>Room</b> of Requirement, which lifts off {{the ground}} and through the Floo Network for a journey with Harry. The ride {{combines}} real sets and animatronics with segments that use wrap-around projection screens.|$|E

5000|$|During production, Mr Garrett {{was arrested}} for {{trespassing}} while covertly filming the events of daily life <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> rubber <b>room.</b> [...] According to Garrett, the arrest came after the Department of Education learned of his intent to collect footage <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> rubber <b>rooms</b> for <b>the</b> exposé.|$|R
5|$|Before the {{beginning}} of the game, the Abyss-dwelling wizard brothers Garamon and Tyball accidentally summon a demon, the Slasher of Veils, while experimenting with inter-dimensional travel. Garamon is used as bait to lure the demon into a room imbued with virtue. However, the demon offers Tyball great power if he betrays Garamon. Tyball agrees, but the betrayal fails; Garamon is killed, but seals the demon <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Because he lacks virtue, Tyball cannot re-enter by himself, and plans to sacrifice Baron Almric's daughter, Arial, at the doorway to gain entrance.|$|E
5|$|In Worcester, Massachusetts, Carlton Chase {{runs from}} an unknown assailant, makes a brief phone call, and then runs {{to a police}} station. After a {{skirmish}} with the guards, he is placed in a large room with cinder blocks for walls and a solid steel door. He screams at the officer that he still is not safe. Suddenly, and mysteriously, he is shot from <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) and John Doggett (Robert Patrick) are informed that Chase was killed with an armor-piercing round, which appears to have entered the room through the air vent in the ceiling. Upon further investigation, the agents discover that the assassin shot through the roof, ceiling and ductwork, and into the victim.|$|E
5|$|Alex realizes Geiger is {{controlling}} the ship. Armed with skeet guns, he goes with Juliano to Geiger's cabin. Geiger remotely detonates explosives <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Annie and Dante, the ship's photographer, notice the people trapped behind the fire doors, and Annie uses a chainsaw {{to cut the}} door open and let them out. Meanwhile, Alex orders the navigator, Merced, to flood the ship and slow it down by opening the ballast doors. As the ship floods, Alex sees Drew on a monitor after she climbs out of the elevator, and runs to save her. Alex notices Geiger leaving the vault and holds him at gunpoint, but he escapes by closing the fire door in front of him. Using the ship's intercom, Geiger explains that he designed the ship's autopilot system and is taking revenge against the cruise line after being fired when he got sick from copper poisoning. Geiger again escapes from Alex by attaching a grenade to a door.|$|E
50|$|Furniture <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> is handcrafted—and {{sometimes}} even built into <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> themselves—to match <b>the</b> rooms’ nonlinear, organic shape. Stone decorations {{throughout the house}} depict animals such as bears, giraffes, frogs, spiders and ants, along with natural elements such as mushrooms and spider webs.

50|$|The cisterns of Fermo are {{an archaeological}} site {{situated}} {{on top of}} the hill, at 310 m above sea level. Fermo boasts one of the most gigantic and well-preserved example of Roman cisterns in Italy. They were built around 1st century a.C. The structure is a rectangular construction of about 30 by 70 m consisting of 30 underground rooms: they provided water for the city probably through public fountains. The underground pipe network above the cisterns was connected to a canal around the external walls. From the canal, small pipes brought water into the cisterns: water inlets are still visible <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms.</b> <b>The</b> cisterns are made of Opus caementicium which is the waterproofing old Roman concrete. The level of <b>the</b> water <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>rooms</b> was about 70 cm and the total amount of water inside was about 3000 mq.|$|R

25|$|Joseph Smith, Taylor, and Richards {{attempted}} to defend themselves. Taylor and Richards used a long walking stick {{in order to}} deflect the guns as they were thrust <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> from behind the door. Smith used a small pepper-box pistol that Cyrus Wheelock had given him earlier that day. Three of the six barrels misfired, but the other three shots {{are believed to have}} injured three of the attackers.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, Milligan played {{games with}} the medium itself. Whole scenes were written in which {{characters}} would leave, close the door behind themselves, yet still be <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Further to this, characters would announce their departure, slam a door, {{but it would be}} another character who had left the room. That character would then beat on the door for re-admittance, the door would open and close and again the wrong character would be locked out.|$|E
25|$|Searle {{argues that}} this is only true for an {{observer}} outside of the room. The {{whole point of the}} thought experiment is to put someone <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> where they can directly observe the operations of consciousness. Searle claims that from his vantage point within the room there is nothing he can see that could imaginably give rise to consciousness, other than himself, and clearly he does not have a mind that can speak Chinese.|$|E

25|$|The 'pseudoscope' (Wheatstone {{coined the}} term from the Greek ψευδίς σκοπειν) was {{introduced}} in 1852, and is in some sort the reverse of the stereoscope, since it causes a solid object to seem hollow, and a nearer one to be farther off; thus, a bust {{appears to be a}} mask, and a tree growing outside of a window looks as if it were growing <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Its purpose was to test his theory of stereo vision and for investigations into what would now be called experimental psychology.|$|E
25|$|Several {{months after}} his arrest, he was sharing a hotel room with two road crew members of Selena y Los Dinos when the two {{brothers}} (who were intoxicated), began wrestling. Chris was also drunk and joined in the rough horseplay. One brother knocked the door off its hinges, and holes in the wall were found <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> Chris decided to sleep at home instead of at the hotel. Abraham Sr. fired the brothers and Chris from the band {{the next morning and}} also forbid Selena from seeing Chris.|$|E
25|$|As Romans was evacuated, one of {{the other}} SWAT {{officers}} then spotted Mixon beside the bedroom door, equipped with the SKS rifle, and fired at him. Mixon was forced to retreat <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> and close the door. The team moved towards the bedroom and partially forced the door open. As he managed to get inside, Sakai was shot and mortally wounded by Mixon. Gonzales rushed into the room next and tripped on the floor, falling in front of Mixon. Mixon shot at Gonzales while he was falling and may have struck Gonzales in the head, although the bullet was deflected by Gonzales' tactical helmet, which protected him from injury. Spotting Mixon, Gonzales opened fire and was joined by Alameda County Sheriff's Deputy Derrick Pope; Mixon was felled by the barrage of gunfire and died from his wounds at 3:20p.m.|$|E

25|$|Searle {{offers a}} variant of his Chinese room argument, calling it the Chess Room Argument, where instead of {{answering}} questions in Chinese, the man in a room is playing chess. Or rather, as Searle explains, he is <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> manipulating symbols which are meaningless to him, while his actions result in winning chess games outside the room. Searle concludes that like a computer, the man has no understanding of chess. Searle compares Deep Blue's victory to {{the manner in which}} a pocket calculator can beat humans at arithmetic; he adds that it is no more significant than a steel robot which is too tough for human beings to tackle during a game of American football. Kurzweil counters that the very same argument could be made of the human brain, since the individual neurons have no true understanding of the bigger problem the brain is working on but, added together, they produce what is known as consciousness.|$|E
25|$|In {{the second}} season finale, Cameron denies that {{exposure}} to Terminators and their shielded nuclear power cells cause cancer in humans, as John believes that if his mother is sick it could be from living with her for so long. Cameron states that she has internal sensors to detect radiation leakage. While rescuing Sarah from the Los Angeles County lockup, Cameron sustains heavy damage, including {{the loss of her}} left eye covering. Cameron then enters the basement of ZeiraCorp to find John Henry. The cyborg's body is subsequently found <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> where John Henry was kept, but missing its chip; the original chip (from Cromartie) was destroyed by Sarah Connor. When John and the T-1001 give chase into the future, a character portrayed by Summer Glau is present, but it is Allison Young, and not Cameron, as Josh Friedman stated in the audio commentary to the finale episode of the show (the dog is not barking at her and she acts as a human female rather than as Cameron).|$|E
25|$|On November 12, 1853, President Antonio López de Santa Anna {{announced}} a competition {{to write a}} national anthem for Mexico. The competition offered a prize for the best poetic composition representing patriotic ideals. Francisco González Bocanegra, a talented poet, {{was not interested in}} participating in the competition. He argued that writing love poems involved very different skills from the ones required to write a national anthem. His fiancée, Guadalupe González del Pino (or Pili), had undaunted faith in her fiancé's poetic skills and was displeased with his constant refusal to participate in spite of her constant prodding and requests from their friends. Under false pretenses, she lured him to a secluded bedroom in her parents' house, locked him into the room, and refused to let him out until he produced an entry for the competition. <b>Inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room</b> in which he was temporarily imprisoned were pictures depicting various events in Mexican history which helped to inspire his work. After four hours of fluent (albeit forced) inspiration, Francisco regained his freedom by slipping all ten verses of his creation under the door. After Francisco received approval from his fiancée and her father, he submitted the poem and won the competition by unanimous vote. González was announced the winner in the publication Official Journal of the Federation (DOF) on February 3, 1854.|$|E

25|$|Another {{clarification}} {{needed is}} that the equivalence principle assumes a constant acceleration of 1g without considering the mechanics of generating 1g. If we do consider the mechanics of it, then we must assume the aforementioned windowless room has a fixed mass. Accelerating it at 1g means {{there is a constant}} force being applied, which = m*g where m is the mass of the windowless room along with its contents (including the observer). Now, if the observer jumps <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> an object lying freely on the floor will decrease in weight momentarily because the acceleration is going to decrease momentarily due to the observer pushing back against the floor in order to jump. The object will then gain weight while the observer is in the air and the resulting decreased mass of the windowless room allows greater acceleration; it will lose weight again when the observer lands and pushes once more against the floor; and it will finally return to its initial weight afterwards. To make all these effects equal those we would measure on a planet producing 1g, the windowless room must be assumed to have the same mass as that planet. Additionally, the windowless room must not cause its own gravity, otherwise the scenario changes even further. These are technicalities, clearly, but practical ones if we wish the experiment to demonstrate more or less precisely the equivalence of 1g gravity and 1g acceleration.|$|E
500|$|Reich {{was much}} {{encouraged}} by the meeting and hoped he would be invited to join Princeton's Institute for Advanced Study. During their next meeting, he gave Einstein a small accumulator, {{and over the next}} 10 days Einstein performed experiments with it in his basement, which involved taking the temperature above, inside and near the device, and stripping it down to its Faraday cage to compare temperatures. He observed an increase of temperature, which Reich argued was caused by orgone. One of Einstein's assistants pointed out that the temperature was lower on the floor than on the ceiling. Einstein concluded that the effect was simply due to the temperature gradient <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room.</b> [...] "Through these experiments I regard the matter as completely solved," [...] he wrote to Reich on 7 February 1941.|$|E
500|$|Andrea then {{proceeds}} {{to take over}} responsibility for Beth, after convincing Maggie to take a break. She locks Beth <b>inside</b> <b>the</b> <b>room,</b> opens the bathroom door, and leaves Beth alone {{to make her own}} choice. She advises the pain will never subside, [...] "but you make room for it". Beth attempts suicide by using a shard of broken mirror to cut her wrist, but Maggie and Lori manage to pry the bathroom door open in time to save Beth, who is bleeding profusely but relatively okay. Andrea returns to the house to check on Beth and is confronted by a furious Maggie. Andrea reasons that she allowed Beth to explore her choices, and Beth is now more convinced than ever that suicide is not an option. Maggie condemns Andrea's actions and forbids her from ever again setting foot inside the house.|$|E
