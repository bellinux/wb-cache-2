Using a standard cardiac pump and a rigid plastic circulation system, <b>distraction</b> <b>forces</b> were measured with a gramometer attached to a PTFE graft while the pressure inside a rigid aortic sac was varied. Results. If the pressure in the ‘aneurysm sac’ is maintained {{at the same level}} as the systemic pressure, the displacement force is zero. The displacement force is affected adversely by the level of systemic pressure, as this rises the displacement forces rise in an almost linear fashion. Conclusions. These observations may have important consequences for stent graft design and use in vivo pressurisation of a sealed sac may therefore not necessarily be an adverse event.

40|$|Purpose: To {{examine the}} changes in <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> {{following}} relining of a conventional abdominal aortic stent-graft with a type IIIb endoleak using the Nellix endovascular sealing device compared to a unilateral stent-graft. Methods: Relining {{is often used to}} repair type IIIb endoleaks, but the consequences to graft stability are unknown. A mathematical model was constructed based on pressure and volume flow through the stent-grafts, incorporating recognized <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> equations. Steady flow was presumed at peak systolic pressures to calculate the maximum <b>distraction</b> <b>force,</b> with gravity ignored. Distraction forces for 28 - to 36 -mm-diameter stent-graft bodies with 16 -mm limbs were calculated and compared to forces following relining with single and double Nellix devices or the Renu unilateral device. Results: Distraction forces for the 28 -, 32 -, and 36 -mm stent-grafts prior to relining were 5. 99, 10. 21, and 14. 99 N, respectively. Similar forces were reported after relining with bilateral Nellix devices (5. 86, 10. 08, and 14. 86 N, respectively). However, use of a unilateral Nellix increased the distraction forces to 9. 92, 14. 14, and 18. 92 N, respectively.

30|$|Vertebral body {{growth in}} depth almost ceased {{completely}} in the lumbar segments spanned by VEPTR implants in contrast to ongoing physiologic growth of about 1  mm/year in uninstrumented controls [17, 18, 19]. In accordance to our findings, L 5 vertebral body width growth measured on AP radiographs {{in a series of}} neuromuscular patients treated by VEPTR also decelerated [5]. Physiologically, H/D ratios remain relatively constant during growth with values slightly below 1 in {{children under the age of}} 10  years [17]. In our study, as a consequence of supranormal gains in height and infranormal gains in depth, H/D ratios significantly increased over time in vertebrae exposed to <b>distraction</b> <b>forces,</b> whereas the ratio remained unchanged in the controls. It is well known that growth is biomechanically mediated [7, 9, 20]: <b>distraction</b> <b>forces</b> accelerate and compressive forces decelerate enchondral spinal growth as guided by two physis beneath the vertebral endplates. Growth in depth and width is provided by periosteal appositional growth and may, therefore, continue well into adulthood [21]. In our study, this circumferential growth was negatively affected. It may well be that implant-related stress shielding played the major role. As a result, the overall vertebral shape changed from slightly deeper than high—common in human lumbar vertebrae—to clearly higher than deep—common in quadruped animals—as well documented in comparative anatomical studies [12, 22]. The flattened VBD growth curve during and the VBH/VBD ratio at the end of the observation period in our study patients exactly match the growth dynamics and shape of growing sheep vertebrae and, presumably, also of other quadrupeds [12].|$|R
30|$|Growth {{modulation}} is {{the bedrock}} of non-fusion strategies {{for the treatment of}} early onset spine deformities. Anecdotal personal communications of VEPTR and growing rod users on putative changes of 3 D morphology of vertebral bodies exposed to year-long instrumented <b>distraction</b> <b>forces</b> oppose to a paucity of clinical studies on that matter. However, those data would help to understand the somehow contradictory biomechanical effects of spinal implants, which keep the spine under distraction {{over a long period of}} growth but at the same time immobilize the bridged section. Instrumented spinal distraction entails deprivation from axial loading and presumably from rotatory and bending forces [14]. Morphological and biomechanical changes gain importance in case of implant removal at the end of growth with subsequent re-exposure of the spine to natural forces. Data on 3 D physiologic vertebral body growth is astonishingly scarce not to speak of pathologic growth. Longitudinal growth, as provided by two growth plates beneath the vertebral endplates, has been estimated to be between 0.8  mm for a thoracic vertebra and 1.1  mm for a lumbar vertebra per year [15, 16]. Furthermore, there are no data on growth rates of seemingly normal spine sections in patients with congenital anomalies of the spine, e.g., if a normal looking lumbar spine is affected by multiple congenital anomalies of the thoracic spine, mainly if the latter is treated by <b>distraction</b> <b>forces.</b> It is not obvious to what extent and how spine growth occurs in the transverse and sagittal planes of treated and untreated early onset spine deformities.|$|R

40|$|Introduction One {{option for}} repair of {{abdominal}} aortic aneurysms with inadequate length of infrarenal neck is fenestrated Endovascular Aneurysm Repair. Significant complications {{may be caused}} by stent-graft migration and component distraction which are both resisted by fixation force and provoked by haemodynamic <b>distraction</b> <b>force.</b> The hypotheses tested in this thesis are that larger angulation of vessels is associated with greater <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> and that greater <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> is associated with higher incidence of migration and component distraction. Method Interobserver variation of a new method of angle measurement was compared with the standard method currently in use in our unit. Computer models of complete fenestrated stent-grafts and their individual components (proximal body, distal body and limb extensions) were then constructed based on the postoperative computed tomography scans of 54 patients. Computational Fluid Dynamic analysis in steady state was used to quantify the <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> acting on each device. Blood pressure was kept constant at 160 mmHg and the impact of morphological features upon <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> was assessed. To test the second hypothesis, patient-specific blood pressures were used to obtain in situ distraction forces that were then related to the incidence of migration and component distraction. Results There {{were no significant differences between}} the old and new methods of angle measurement (p=. 723, WSR). Inlet cross-sectional area (XSA) exhibited a strong, positive correlation with total RDF in complete stent-grafts, proximal body and distal body components. Outlet angulation ≥ 45 ° was significantly associated with greater total RDF in complete stent-grafts and limb extension components (Median total RDF in complete stent-grafts with angle < 45 ° = 2. 6 N vs 6. 2 N in those ≥ 45 °, p<. 001. Limb extensions: 1. 4 N vs 2. 1 N, p=. 004, MWU). There was no significant difference between total RDF acting on the proximal or distal bodies that underwent migration or component distraction versus those that did not. Limb extensions that were observed to migrate were exposed to significantly greater total RDF compared to those that did not migrate (Median total RDF 2. 9 N, range 2. 7 - 6. 3 N versus 1. 6 N, range 0. 4 - 3. 8 N, p=. 003, MWU). Conclusions For a given blood pressure XSA was the most important morphological determinant of total RDF.

40|$|ObjectiveSecure {{fixation}} of {{endovascular stent}} grafts {{is essential for}} successful endovascular aneurysm repair. Hemodynamic distraction forces are generated by blood pressure and blood flow and act against fixation force to encourage migration that may eventually lead to late stent graft failure. The aim of this in silico {{study was to determine}} which morphologic features were associated with greater <b>distraction</b> <b>force.</b> MethodsComputer models of 54 in situ fenestrated stent grafts were constructed from postoperative computed tomography scans by use of image processing software. Computational fluid dynamic analysis was then performed by use of a commercial finite volume solver with boundary conditions representative of peak systole. <b>Distraction</b> <b>force</b> results were obtained for each component of the stent graft. <b>Distraction</b> <b>force</b> was correlated with lumen cross-sectional area (XSA) at the inlet and outlet of components and was compared between groups of components, depending on the magnitude of four predefined angles within the aortoiliac territory that we describe in detail. ResultsMedian total resultant <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> (RDF) acting on the fenestrated proximal bodies was 4. 8 N (1. 3 - 15. 7 N); bifurcated distal bodies, 5. 6 N (1. 0 - 8. 0 N); and limb extensions, 1. 7 N (0. 6 - 8. 4 N). Inlet XSA exhibited strong, positive correlation with total RDF in proximal body and distal body components (Spearman correlation coefficient ρ, 0. 883 and 0. 802, respectively). Outlet XSA exhibited a similarly strong, positive correlation with total RDF in limb extension components (ρ, 0. 822). Outlet angulation ≥ 45 degrees was associated with greater total RDF in the limb extension components only (P =. 004). ConclusionsFor a given blood pressure, XSA was the most important morphologic determinant of total RDF. Angulation within the aorta was not large enough to influence this, whereas iliac angulation affecting outlet angulation of limb extension components was associated with significantly greater total RDF. Clinical RelevanceDistraction force acts against endovascular fixation to provoke stent graft migration. These blood flow simulations describe the relationship between morphologic features of the aortoiliac vessels and <b>distraction</b> <b>force.</b> A greater understanding of this relationship may help avoid endovascular solutions that carry a high risk of migration. In some cases, this may mean an alternative choice of seal zone or even device. In others, it could lend support to an open surgical approach or to a more intensive follow-up regimen...|$|E

30|$|Spinal growth {{modulation}} {{by means}} of posterior instrumented distraction or anterior tethering is the core component of established and novel methods to control progressive spine deformities in childhood [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]. The overall growth stimulating benefits are traditionally objectified by simple measurement of the T 1 -S 1 distance on anteroposterior radiographs [6]. This approach includes the changes of the morphology and severity of the curve during the observational period, {{the growth of the}} vertebral bodies and the intervertebral discs. However, T 1 -S 1 values are limited by the projectional nature of a spine radiograph and the ignorance of more detailed regional growth phenomenon. Experimental data support the tremendous remodelling effect of <b>distraction</b> <b>forces</b> on single vertebral bodies exerted by instrumented bridging of multiple spinal segments [7, 8, 9]. <b>Distraction</b> <b>forces</b> are even able to promote growth of unilateral congenital bony vertebral bars [10]. Little is known about the effects of distraction-based treatments of early onset spine deformities on the growth and shape of individual human vertebral bodies. A retrospective growing rod case series on twenty patients published in 2012 focused only on the effect of longitudinal growth and a most recent retrospective vertical expandable prosthetic titanium rib (VEPTR) series on 26 children focused on height and width growth of the fifth lumbar and the topmost instrumented thoracic vertebra [5, 11]. In both studies, extra gain in vertebral height growth compared to historical controls was objectified. However, growth in width was diminished. Within the framework of a true non-fusion strategy, a change of the three-dimensional (3 D) vertebral morphology might be of biomechanical importance when the spine is re-exposed to full load after removal of the growth-promoting implants at the end of growth. We, therefore, set out to further investigate the effects of vertebral growth modulation looking at individual multiple lumbar levels.|$|R

30|$|This {{technique}} {{differs from}} other methods {{in that it}} does not involve the tendinous structures like other devices do (i.e., Agee Digit Widget). As noted in this marketed device, the <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> is in line with the schanzes inserted into the bone piercing the middle phalanx extensor tendon; it has the propensity to be pulled out if the force is increased. In our method, the <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> is perpendicular to the pin inserted, and also because of its pentagonal design, it will exert pressure only on the bone; no soft tissue structure is involved in distraction. Thus, it can at first be used as a distraction device to slowly distract the soft tissues, and then after reaching the best possible result, active and passive physiotherapy can begin. There has been no mention of using the distal phalanx to achieve phalangeal, metacarpal, or soft tissue distraction in the literature.|$|E
40|$|International audienceBackground: During total knee {{arthroplasty}} (TKA), femoral rotation can {{be adjusted}} either in relation to bony landmarks or by tensioning the ligaments with the knee in 90 degrees of flexion. The primary objective {{of this study was}} to compare femoral rotations achieved using various ligament-tensioning devices. The secondary objective was to compare these femoral rotations to that indicated by the transepicondylar axis (TEA). Material and methods: We performed 13 posterior-stabilised TKA procedures using HiFit (Ceraver (R)) on cadaver knees. Before performing the posterior condyle cut, we used an original method to measure the femoral rotation induced by five different ligament-tensioning devices (2 with a ratchet mechanism, 1 with screws, 1 force-sensing device, and 1 with spacer blocks) and the central tibio-femoral distance(CTFD). Results: Both ratchet tensioners provided significantly greater mean external rotation values (P= 0. 002), of 4. 94 degrees and 4. 46 degrees, respectively, compared to the force-sensing and spacer tensioners. Significant differences were found across devices for CTFD, with a mean difference of about 2 mm between the ratchet and screwtensioners versus the force-sensing and spacer tensioners. The mean differences in rotations obtained using the tensioners versus the TEA were close to 0 degrees but with standard deviations greater than 4 degrees. Conclusion: Femoral rotation was dependent on the <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> applied to the joint. Tensioners that did not measure the <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> were associated with greater <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> and external rotation values.

The specific technical aspects of the TBW for simple olecranon fracture are subject to ongoing debate as there is little evidence to support any specific technique [5, 9, 13, 14]. Nevertheless, the specific surgical technique or technical aspects of the procedure are preferred based more upon the eminence of the surgeon or group rather than the data.

Patients and Methods: Tweleve maxillary canines in six patients were retracted rapidly in three weeks by a custom-made tooth-born appliance. Radiographic records were taken to evaluate the effects of heavy applied force on canine and anchorage teeth. Results: Average retraction was 7. 05 mm in three weeks (2. 35 mm/week). Canines rotated distal- in by mean 3. 5 degrees. Anchorage loss was from 0 to 0. 8 mm with average of 0. 3 mm. Root resorption of canines was negligible, and was not significant clinically. Periodontium was normal after rapid retraction. No hazard for pulp vitality was observed. Discussion: PDM responded well to heavy <b>distraction</b> <b>force</b> by Do protocol. Rapid canine retraction seems to be a safe method and can considerabely reduce orthodontic time...|$|E
40|$|Objective:To {{compare and}} {{ascertain}} the suitability for endovascular aortic graft fixation of the Palmaz stent, the Strecker stent, the modified Gianturco-Z stent, the Wallstent {{and a new}} stent made of the shape memory alloy nitinol. Design, setting and materials:In vitro studies using a simple tensiometer to assess the forces required to distract each stent from porcine aorta; and using a high-pressure, pulsatile-flow pump to measure flow rates required to dislodge stents holding grafts within porcine aortas, with assessment using endovascular ultrasound. Results:The Palmaz, the modified Gianturco-Z and the nitinol stents resisted significantly greater <b>distraction</b> <b>forces</b> than the Wallstent, but endovascular ultrasound examination revealed that the modified Gianturco-Z stent was seen {{to move away from}} the aortic wall at high flow rates precluding adequate fixation. The Strecker stent could not be assessed using these techniques. Conclusions:A nitinol stent may be suitable for aortic graft fixation, has characteristics similar to the Palmaz stent and has shape memory effect which may overcome the difficulties of introduction of wider diameter stents through narrow arteries...|$|R

5|$|Constantine neither {{enjoyed his}} legal studies, nor found the work easy, but was {{determined}} to prove he could succeed. His wife kept him motivated, restricted visitors to avoid <b>distractions</b> and <b>forced</b> him to study, making him continue when he was several times tempted to give up. The family moved to London in 1949; between 1950 and 1954, Constantine passed the required series of examinations, and in 1954 he was called to the bar by the Middle Temple.|$|R
