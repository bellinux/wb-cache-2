50|$|India's Thar Desert {{spans the}} western states of Rajasthan and Gujarat. More people live here {{than in any other}} desert, with a {{population}} density 100 times that of the Sahara, and growing all the time. Fortunately the people of the desert look favourably on their wild neighbours, as demonstrated by the villagers of Khichan, who feed large flocks of demoiselle cranes over the winter. The birds are revered as symbols of fortune. Thapar visits a desert dwelling of the Bishnoi people, strict vegetarians and guardians of the animal population. Despite this, poaching is rife and the blackbucks, filmed in the breeding season, are being increasingly marginalised. The chinkara or Indian gazelle is an even hardier animal, getting all the moisture it needs from plants and the morning dew. Wolves and jackals are also shown. Around a camp fire, the nocturnal inhabitants of the desert are filmed as they emerge from the sand: dung beetles, gerbils and predatory saw scaled vipers and scorpions. The people of Jodhpur are vegetarians but use domesticated oxen, camels and buffalo as working animals. When they die, the carcasses are taken {{to the edge of the}} city and left as food for scavengers, among them Asian king <b>vultures,</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>white-rumped</b> <b>vultures</b> and griffon vultures. Waterholes attract many animals before they dry up during the heat of summer. It is also used by people and their livestock for washing and drinking. Birds shown include pied kingfisher, red-wattled lapwing and black-winged stilt. To escape egrets, frogs hop across the surface of the water. At night, climbing perch leave the water and travel across land to find other pools, and an ingenious ratel uses logs to reach a stricken kingfisher chick. The most extreme environment is the Rann of Kutch salt flats where only the monsoon brings relief to the last population of Indian wild asses. In the closing scenes, Thapar observes flocks of flamingos which come to the salt flats in times of flood.|$|R

40|$|Of {{the nine}} Accipitridae vulture species found within Nepal the IUCN categorises <b>White-rumped,</b> <b>Indian</b> <b>Vulture,</b> Slender-billed and Red-headed Vultures as Critically Endangered and Egyptian Vulture as Endangered. Dramatic declines have {{occurred}} {{since the mid}} 1990 s with the <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Vulture,</b> <b>Indian</b> Vulture and Slender-billed Vulture population declining by over 97 %. The remaining species are listed as Near Threatened or Least Concern. Veterinary use of the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) diclofenac has been {{proven to be a}} key threat in the region for Gyps vultures and appears likely that it may also affect other Accipitridae vultures. The drug is transferred to vultures via consumption of dead livestock carcass. Ingestion of the drug causes visceral gout and kidney failure, which leads to the birds death. Consumption of diclofenac and the majority of other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are fatal to individuals. Only one NSAID, meloxicam, has been tested and proven safe for vultures. There are other factors such as food shortage in local scale, habitat loss, climate change and pesticides/poisoning that play some role on population decline. Managing vulture conservation across Nepal can be problematic just as it is throughout the Indian subcontinent due to the variable level of protection afforded to vultures through legislation and enforcement in each political region particularly regarding NSAID regulation and use. However, great gains have been made on removing diclofenac from sale within the Indian subcontinent. Continuing and enhancing the holistic conservation approach between all stakeholders, government and non-government organisations, across the species range is required to conserve them for future generations. Indeed, it is likely that a number of species will become extinct if a greater conservation effort is not forthcoming in the very near future...|$|R

Pine forests situated between Ooty and Thalakunda is a small downhill region where pine trees are arranged in an orderly fashion. Wenlock Downs is a grassland area typical of the original bioscape of the Nilgiris with gently undulating hills. Mudumalai National Park and tiger reserve lies on the north {{western side of the}} Nilgiri Hills. The sanctuary is divided into 5 ranges - Masinagudi, Thepakadu, Mudumalai, Kargudi and Nellakota.

5000|$|India {{boasts a}} variety of species and organisms. [...] Apart {{from a handful of}} the major farm animals such as cows, buffaloes, goats, chickens, and camels, India has an amazingly wide {{spectrum}} of animals native to the country. It is home to Bengal and Indochinese tigers, Indian lions, deer, pythons, wolves, foxes, bears, crocodiles, wild dogs, monkeys, snakes, antelope species, varieties of bison and the Asian elephant. The region's rich and diverse wildlife is preserved in 120+ national parks, 18 Bio-reserves and 500+ wildlife sanctuaries across the country. India has some of the most biodiverse regions of the world and hosts four of the worldâ€™s 35 biodiversity hotspots - or treasure-houses - that is the Western Ghats, the Eastern Himalayas, Indo-Burma and Nicobar islands in Sundaland. Since India is home to a number of rare and threatened animal species, wildlife management in the country is essential to preserve these species. India is one of the seventeen megadiverse countries. According to one study, India along with other 16 mega diverse countries is home to about 60-70% of the world's biodiversity. India, lying within the Indomalaya ecozone, is home to about 7.6% of all mammalian, 12.6% of avian (bird), 6.2% of reptilian, and 6.0% of flowering plant species. Many Indian species are descendants of taxa originating in Gondwana, to which India originally belonged. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards, and collision with, the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. However, volcanism and climatic change 20 million years ago caused the extinction of many endemic Indian forms. Soon thereafter, mammals entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes {{on either side of the}} emerging Himalaya. As a result, among Indian species, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are endemic, contrasting with 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians. Notable endemics are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and the brown and carmine Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172, or 2.9%, of IUCN-designated threatened species. These include the Asian elephant, the Asiatic lion, Bengal tiger, Indian rhinoceros, mugger crocodile, and <b>Indian</b> <b>white-rumped</b> <b>vulture,</b> which suffered a near-extinction from ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-treated cattle.|$|E

50|$|Gyps {{species were}} the most {{affected}} by diclofenac. The population of the <b>White-rumped</b> <b>vulture</b> (Gyps bengalensis) fell 99.7% between 1993 and 2002. The populations of the Indian vulture (Gyps indicus) and the slender-billed vulture (Gyps tenuirostris) fell 97.4%. The percentages differ slightly because the <b>white-rumped</b> <b>vulture</b> is more sensitive to diclofenac {{than the other two}} species, but all three were in danger of extinction. Two other species of Gyps, the Himalayan vulture (Gyps himalayensis) and the Eurasian griffon (Gyps fulvus) were less affected, the Eurasian griffon because it only winters in India and has a much smaller initial population and the Himalayan vulture, with a similarly small population, because it is exclusively mountain-dwelling. Vulture populations have continued to decline in India at a rate of between 20% and 40% each year since 2007.|$|R
40|$|Nine {{species of}} {{vultures}} are recorded from Indian subcontinent. The populations of three resident Gyps species, namely Oriental <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Vulture</b> Gyps bengalensis, Long-billed Vulture Gyps indicus and Slender-billed Vulture Gyps tenuirostris crashed during the mid nineties {{of the last}} century. Vulture declines were first documented at Keoladeo National Park, Bharatpur, Rajasthan. Subsequently, the crash in populations was documented across the country. During the present study, surveys on identified tracks were done in 2007 to repeat surveys done previously in 1992, 2000, 2002 and 2003. This was done to determine the population trend in the three species of vultures and also to get a rough estimate of the surviving population of vultures in 2007. The latest repeat surveys were carried out from March to June 2007 by driving in a motor vehicle and recording vultures within 500 m on the either side of each transect. The {{results indicate that the}} population of the three species of vultures continues to decline at an alarming rate. Numbers of Oriental <b>White-rumped</b> <b>Vulture</b> declined by 99. 9 % between 1992 and 2007 on the transects surveyed each year during that period. The equivalent decline in the combined total of Gyps indicus and G. tenuirostris was 96. 8 %.
