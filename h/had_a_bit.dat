He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing in the chorus of the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour.

The film opened to favorable reviews and critics acclaimed the individual performances of the actors. Nichols had a small part in the drama film Resurrecting the Champ (2007), in which she played the assistant to a sportswriter (Josh Hartnett) who believes he has found a former boxing legend (Samuel L. Jackson) living homeless on the streets.

5|$|After her parents' {{separation}} in 1976, Jolie and {{her brother}} lived with their mother, who had abandoned her acting ambitions to focus on raising her children. Her mother raised her Catholic, but did not require {{her to go to}} church. As a child, she often watched films with her mother and it was this, rather than her father's successful career, that inspired her interest in acting, though at age five she <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Voight's Lookin' to Get Out (1982). When Jolie was six years old, Bertrand and her live-in partner, filmmaker Bill Day, moved the family to Palisades, New York; they returned to Los Angeles five years later. Jolie then decided she wanted to act and enrolled at the Lee Strasberg Theatre Institute, where she trained for two years and appeared in several stage productions.|$|E

5|$|When he was {{approximately}} 15, Stiller obtained {{a small part}} with one line on the television soap opera Guiding Light, although in an interview he characterized his performance as poor. He was later cast in {{a role in the}} 1986 Broadway revival of John Guare's The House of Blue Leaves, alongside John Mahoney; the production would garner four Tony Awards. During its run, Stiller produced a satirical mockumentary whose principal was fellow actor Mahoney. His comedic work was well received by the cast and crew of the play, and he followed up with a 10-minute short called The Hustler of Money, a parody of the Martin Scorsese film The Color of Money. The film featured him in a send-up of Tom Cruise's character and Mahoney in the Paul Newman role, only this time as a bowling hustler instead of a pool shark. The short got the attention of Saturday Night Live, which aired it in 1987, and two years later offered him a spot as a writer. In the meantime, he also <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> part in Steven Spielberg's Empire of the Sun.|$|E

It was entitled Detak Detik and starred Mat Sola as the Jackie Gleason character. Art Carney rang the cast prior to production to give them his best wishes. It was decided to make Mat Sola a Silver Bird taxi driver as they <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> more prestige in Indonesia. They left Nurbuat who mirrored Ed Norton as a sewerage worker. The chemistry worked well. They had to remove any references to alcohol as Indonesia is {{a country with a}} majority of Muslim population.|$|E

500|$|The {{character}} was paired with fellow resident Izzy Hoyland (Natalie Bassingthwaighte) who shared a deceptive personality with him. This created many stories for both characters as they plotted against their neighbours. Dennis stated [...] "the Paul and Izzy relationship was fantastic, {{it was very}} popular. Izzy was an interesting character because she was very emotional and insecure. That's what drove her evil ways. She <b>had</b> <b>a</b> <b>bit</b> of a soulmate in Paul."
