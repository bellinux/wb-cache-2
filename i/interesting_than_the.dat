25|$|Around 1500, Europeans learnt how to cast iron, {{and shifted}} their cannon {{productions}} to one-piece iron muzzle-loaders. China started to adopt European breech-loading swivel guns from 1500 onward, limiting {{at the same}} time the production of their own muzzle-loaders, because of the high effectiveness of the breech-loading swivel gun as an anti-personnel gun, which to them was more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> sheer power of a cannonball.|$|E

25|$|Consider a {{periodic}} tiling by unit squares (it looks like infinite graph paper). Now cut one square into two rectangles. The tiling obtained {{in this way}} is non-periodic: there is no non-zero shift that leaves this tiling fixed. But clearly this example is much less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Penrose tiling. In order to rule out such boring examples, one defines an aperiodic tiling to be one that does not contain arbitrary large periodic parts.|$|E
25|$|The String Sextet, {{entitled}} Souvenir de Florence, {{is considered}} {{by some to be}} more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Piano Trio, better music intrinsically and better written. None of Tchaikovsky's other chamber works has a more positive opening, and the simplicity of the main section of the second movement is even more striking. After this very affecting music, the third movement progresses at least initially into a fresh, folksy world. Even more folksy is the opening of the finale, though Tchaikovsky takes this movement in a more academic direction with the incorporation of a fugue. This work has also been played in arrangements for string orchestra.|$|E

25|$|Łojek {{notes that}} historiography {{of the fall}} of the Triple Alliance is sparse, as it was overshadowed by the {{interest}} in issues related to the French Revolution; as he notes, a war that never started is much less <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> revolution that changed the world. He notes {{that the end of the}} alliance was a triumph of the Russian diplomacy, and failure of the British one, as well as a personal failure of Pitt, who since this defeat removed himself from the British foreign policy. From the Polish perspective, he notes that the failure of the Polish diplomacy to pursue an alliance with the Triple Alliance was another major factor which resulted in its weakening, and by correspondingly strengthening Russia, this Polish inactivity contributed to the fall of Poland. He notes that although some Poles, like Antoni Augustyn Deboli, argued for an alliance with Great Britain, king Stanisław August Poniatowski, who controlled most of Polish diplomacy, refused to stand in opposition to Russia, which in hindsight was a major blow for Poland.|$|E
500|$|Los Angeles Times writer Gerrick Kennedy said {{he liked}} the Robin character's charm and {{chemistry}} with Katherine, and said their story arc [...] "has already grown infinitely more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> Angie Bolen mystery". He said the relationship made more sense for Katherine than her previous subplots involving her romance with Mike and her mental breakdown following their break-up. Isabelle Carreau of TV Squad said she was glad the episode was centered on the supporting cast, particularly praising the attention to Bob and Lee, but she said that {{did not like the}} direction the Andrew character had taken, and felt the relationship between Katherine and Robin had evolved too fast.|$|E
500|$|While the {{presentation}} was received positively, the gameplay received criticism from multiple reviews. [...] More specifically, the boss fights and repetitive hiding and chasing gameplay mechanics were cited as weak. GameSpot's Brad Shoemaker argued the cinematic portions were underpinned by the gameplay, believing that players would more likely {{want to finish}} the game for its storyline than the fun they'll have playing it. Game Revolution's AA White stated [...] "Clock Tower 3 is ultimately one of those games whose cinemas are more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> actual gameplay and from a gamer's standpoint, that's never a good thing." [...] Critics also agreed that the game felt too short.|$|E

500|$|Criticism of {{the game}} was aimed at its level of difficulty, which is {{higher than that of}} its predecessor; 1UP.com {{mentioned}} that this was most noticeable near the end {{of the game}}, where [...] "there are levels that consist of nothing but wave after wave of difficult enemies thrown at you to deplete your ammo, and then more waves of enemies after that." [...] GameSpy, however, praised this aspect of the game, saying that it made Going Commando more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> original. Some reviewers also felt that the game's space combat was poorly done in comparison to the rest of the game, and that the [...] "Giant Clank" [...] levels were [...] "brainless and boring".|$|E
500|$|The {{route for}} the 2015 race was {{announced}} on 15 April. The route was [...] shorter than in 2014; it was therefore [...] in length. The changes {{came in the}} final section of the route, with the Côte de la Vecquée removed and the Col du Rosier and the Col du Maquisard added instead. The second change was a reduction in distance between the third-last and second-last climbs: the distance was cut from [...] to , with a small unclassified climb also added. Cyclingnews.com described the first change as a [...] "much harder combination" [...] suggested that the new route would make the race more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> 2014 edition, which it described as [...] "painfully dull".|$|E

500|$|The film is {{important}} as the first known character role by Lon Chaney. [...] Martin F. Norden, author of The Cinema of Isolation: A History of Physical Disability in the Movies, describes the plot as following the prevailing industry standards of disabled characters, where the figure [...] "nobly" [...] withdraws from the relationship after plotting revenge and then saving his beloved. Norden cites a quote from Chaney, saying this film made Chaney realize that [...] "the screen was more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> stage". The film is now considered lost. It is unknown when the film was lost, {{but if it was}} in Universal's vaults it would have been deliberately destroyed along with the remaining copies of Universal's silent era films in 1948.|$|E
500|$|Since airing, {{the episode}} has {{received}} mixed reviews from television critics. The {{authors of the}} book I Can't Believe It's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide, Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood, said: [...] "It's quite a shock to discover that this confident, fully rounded episode {{was the first to}} be made. The perfect template." [...] Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that he [...] "thought 'Evening' was a reasonably good episode." [...] and added that [...] "Still, it’s an awkward piece, and not one I enjoyed a great deal. To be sure, 'Evening' was generally entertaining, but it's nothing special." [...] In a DVD review of the first season, David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 1.5/5. Another DVD review from The Digital Bits calls the behind the scenes story more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> actual episode.|$|E
500|$|The {{graphics}} received mixed reviews. Lewis {{called them}} [...] "more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> first game, but marginally so", and Meuller called them [...] "dated", with environments seeming [...] "bland and drab, and the enemies [...] generic". The GameTrailers reviewer praised the character animations, but cited the environments as bland {{and felt that}} there were too few FMVs and too many game engine-driven cutscenes, which he described as [...] "awful". Parkin criticized the game's graphic capacities, commenting that players would [...] "stop watching the main screen instead fixing upon the little map in the corner to guide your character towards hostile red dots that only materialize polygonal just seconds before you lock swords.", while Jarvis said {{that it had not}} improved from the previous game and called the colors [...] "very murky, drab and dark". 1UP said that the graphics [...] " [...] hold up to the visual quality of Cavia's other titles like [...] ".|$|E
5000|$|Villoria also {{reviewed}} the Dreamcast version; {{he felt the}} CG sequences were [...] "great", and that the character animations were [...] "fluid" [...] and [...] "seamless". He also commented that the level designs were much more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> in <b>the</b> PlayStation and Nintendo 64 versions. Although Villoria thought the Dreamcast and PlayStation versions were very similar, he felt the Dreamcast version suffered in terms of gameplay since it did not feature special moves.|$|R

500|$|The team {{developed}} {{the story and}} design simultaneously. [...] "We use the story to expose the mechanics, and we use the mechanics to tell the story," [...] said Dan Houser. Houser {{found it difficult to}} create the narrative, as the game is so strongly focused on player freedom. He wanted the story to be more nuanced and <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> generic [...] "rise and fall and rise again of a superhero bad guy". The game's script was also focused on mission objectives, attempting to implement high amounts of interactivity. Houser felt that each mission is [...] "its own short story", and part of an [...] "overarching story". Houser and co-writer James Worrall drew influence from mob films, and the mafiosi featured in films by Martin Scorsese. When writing the story, Houser and Worrall regularly met with the designers, and filled a room with post-it notes to reconstruct the story components to shape the game.|$|E
500|$|Reception of the game's storyline was mixed. Although Shoemaker and Sliwinski praised its [...] "dark" [...] tone, Shoemaker {{found some}} story {{elements}} (such as Gollum's introduction) forced {{and designed to}} appeal to a particular audience. According to Game Informer Matt Miller, Shadow of Mordor fails to successfully tie together all of its various plot threads in the game's conclusion. Kevin VanOrd of GameSpot also found the storyline erratic, dragged down by anti-climactic fights and scenes. Dan Stapleton of IGN wrote that the story introduced memorable characters but would not make sense to fans of the series, and his interest in the game waned towards its end. Destructoid Chris Carter was disappointed in a plot he considered generic ("Go here, kill this, draw out this big bad, then kill him for your family"); the game failed to add anything new to the universe, and its side missions were more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> main campaign.|$|E
500|$|The strongest {{themes in}} Sherwood's early evangelical {{writings}} are {{the need to}} recognize one's innate [...] "depravity" [...] {{and the need to}} prepare oneself for eternity. For Sherwood, the most important lessons emphasize [...] "faith, resignation, and implicit obedience to the will of God." [...] In her adaptation of John Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (1678)—The Infant's Progress (1821)—she represents original sin as a child named [...] "In-bred Sin" [...] who tempts the young pilgrims {{on their way to the}} Celestial City (Heaven) and it is these battles with In-bred Sin that constitute the major conflict of the text. The allegory is complex and, as Demers admits, [...] "tedious" [...] for even the [...] "willing reader." [...] Thus, [...] "some young readers may have found [...] activities more <b>interesting</b> <b>than</b> <b>the</b> spiritual struggles of the little heroes, reading the book as an adventure story rather than as a guide to salvation."
