60|$|The {{girl would}} have been {{striking}} in any company. Neale thought her neither beautiful nor pretty, but he kept on looking. Her arms were bare, her dress cut very low. Her face offered vivid contrast to the carmine on her lips. It was a round, soft face, with narrow eyes, dark, seductive, bold. She tilted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and suddenly smiled at Neale. It startled him. It was a smile with the shock of a bullet. It held Neale, so that when she crossed to him he could not move. He felt rather than saw Hough return to his side. The girl {{took hold of the}} lapels of Neale's coat. She looked up. Her eyes were dark, with what seemed red shadows deep in them. She had white teeth. The carmined lips curled in a smile--a smile, impossible to believe, of youth and sweetness, that disclosed a dimple in her cheek. She was pretty. She was holding him, pulling him a little toward her.|$|E

They got out the {{presents}} {{which they had been}} buying to carry home--humble things and cheap, but they would be fine there, and welcome. And they gave to Joan a present from Pere Fronte and one from her mother--the one a little leaden image of the Holy Virgin, the other half a yard of blue silk ribbon; and she was as pleased as a child; and touched, too, as one could see plainly enough. Yes, she kissed those poor things over and over again, {{as if they had been}} something costly and wonderful; and she pinned the Virgin on her doublet, and sent for her helmet and tied the ribbon on that; first one way, then another; then a new way, then another new way; and with each effort perching the helmet on her hand and holding it off this way and that, and canting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and then the other, examining the effect, as a bird does when it has got a new bug. And she said she could almost wish she was going to the wars again; for then she would fight with the better courage, as having always with her something which her mother's touch had blessed.|$|E

[...] Mrs. Churchley {{inclined}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and looked gracious; she flourished about her face, in a vaguely protecting sheltering way, an enormous fan of red feathers. Everything in her composition, for Adela Chart, was enormous. She had big eyes, big teeth, big shoulders, big hands, big rings and bracelets, big jewels of every sort and many of them. The train of her crimson dress was longer than any other; her house was huge; her drawing-room, especially now {{that the company had}} left it, looked vast, and it offered to the girl's eyes a collection of the largest sofas and chairs, pictures, mirrors, clocks, that she had ever beheld. Was Mrs. Churchley's fortune also large, to account for so many immensities? Of this Adela could know nothing, but it struck her, while she smiled sweetly back at their entertainer, that she had better try to find out. Mrs. Churchley had at least a high-hung carriage drawn by the tallest horses, and in the Row she was to be seen perched on a mighty hunter. She was high and extensive herself, though not exactly fat; her bones were big, her limbs were long, and her loud hurrying voice resembled the bell of a steamboat. While she spoke to his daughter she had the air of hiding from Colonel Chart, a little shyly, behind the wide ostrich fan. But Colonel Chart was not a man to be either ignored or eluded.|$|E
6000|$|But when I {{found that}} Biddy could never succeed in getting near {{her in the}} pasture, and that any kind of success in the milking {{operations}} required my vigorous personal exertions morning and evening, the matter wore a more serious aspect, and I began to feel quite pensive and apprehensive. It is very well {{to talk of the}} pleasures of the milkmaid going out in the balmy freshness of the purple dawn; but imagine a poor fellow pulled out of bed on a drizzly, rainy morning, and equipping himself for a scamper through a wet pasture lot, rope in hand, at the heels of such a termagant as mine! In fact, madam established a regular series of exercises, which had all to be gone through before she would suffer herself to be captured; as, first, she would station herself plump {{in the middle of a}} marsh, which lay at the lower part of the lot, and look very innocent and absent-minded, as if reflecting on some sentimental subject. [...] "Suke! Suke! Suke!" [...] I ejaculate, cautiously tottering along the edge of the marsh, and holding out an ear of corn. The lady looks gracious, and comes forward, almost within reach of my hand. I make a plunge to throw the rope over her horns, and away she goes, kicking up mud and water into my face in her flight, while I, losing my balance, tumble forward into the marsh. I pick myself up, and, full of wrath, behold her placidly chewing her cud on the other side, with the meekest air imaginable, as who should say, [...] "I hope you are not hurt, sir." [...] I dash through swamp and bog furiously, resolving to carry all by a coup de main. Then follows a miscellaneous season of dodging, scampering, and bopeeping, among the trees of the grove, interspersed with sundry occasional races across the bog aforesaid. I always wondered how I caught her every day; and when I had tied <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> post and her heels to another, I wiped the sweat from my brow, and thought I was paying dear for the eccentricities of genius. A genius she certainly was, for besides her surprising agility, she had other talents equally extraordinary. There was no fence that she could not take down; nowhere that she could not go. She took the pickets off the garden fence at her pleasure, using her horns as handily as I could use a claw hammer. Whatever she had a mind to, whether it were a bite in the cabbage garden, or a run in the corn patch, or a foraging expedition into the flower borders, she made herself equally welcome and at home. Such a scampering and driving, such cries of [...] "Suke here" [...] and [...] "Suke there," [...] as constantly greeted our ears, kept our little establishment in a constant commotion. At last, when she one morning made a plunge at the skirts of my new broadcloth frock coat, and carried off one flap on her horns, my patience gave out, and I determined to sell her.|$|E

The worst of them all in their present complicated state {{are the ones that}} concern marriage and the other hideous sex-taboos. They seem to have been among the earliest human abuses; for marriage arises from the stone-age practice of felling a woman of another tribe with a blow of one's club, and dragging her off by the hair of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one's</b> own cave as a slave and drudge; and they are still the most persistent and cruel of any--so much so, that your own people, as you know, taboo even the fair and free discussion of this the most important and serious question of life and morals. They make it, as we would say at home, a refuge for enforced ignorance. For it's well known that early tribes hold the most superstitious ideas about the relation of men to women, and dread the most ridiculous and impossible evils resulting from it; and these absurd terrors of theirs seem to have been handed on intact to civilised races, so that for fear of I know not what ridiculous bogey of their own imaginations, or dread of some unnatural restraining deity, men won't even discuss a matter of so much importance to them all, but, rather than let the taboo of silence be broken, will allow such horrible things to take place in their midst as I have seen with my eyes for these last six or seven weeks in your cities. O Frida, you can't imagine what things--for I know they hide them from you: cruelties of lust and neglect and shame such as you couldn't even dream of; women dying of foul disease, in want and dirt deliberately forced upon them by the will of your society; destined beforehand for death, a hateful lingering death--a death more disgusting than aught you can conceive--in order that the rest of you may be safely tabooed, each a maid intact, for the man who weds her. It's the hatefullest taboo of all the hateful taboos I've ever seen on my wanderings, the unworthiest of a pure or moral community." ...|$|R
40|$|Jean Paul Sartre is waiting, {{waiting to}} become {{what he wants}} to become through writing, writing about what he is {{still trying to figure out}} a way to put his {{thoughts}} into words. So he spends hours that turn into days that turn into weeks that turn into months that turn into a lifetime of asking himself: Is this really what I’m meant to be doing? Sartre is marking his presence on the Earth, trying to make sense of a situation through writing words, words that will eventually represent his thoughts as if those thoughts were still alive. Does that make sense? Sartre thinks. Can a thought have a life of its own? He doesn’t like the words, but he starts to write them down, just in case. Can - ‘scratch’ - a thought – ‘scratch, scratch’ - have a life – ‘scratch, scratch’ - of its own – ‘scratch, scratch, scratch’… Oh no! What is happening? Now we are travelling through time and space. “Losing you Sartre, we are losing you”, flying across an ocean, entering another time zone, no longer in Paris, we’re in New York, and oh my goodness it is, isn’t it, it is Carrie Bradshaw. We see her through an open window, until the camera moves us into the room where we see her typing a script from which the actress Sarah Jessica Parker who plays Carrie in the television series Sex and the City and two subsequent movies, is just about to say the words that will enable us to understand these words represent Carrie’s thoughts, as those thoughts are escaping from somewhere that is deep within her subconscious, some might call it her soul, or others might call it … I don’t know what they might call it, but whatever it is, it is deep, very deep, and it’s late at night, and Carrie is alone in her room with her thoughts. The walls in the apartment are painted blue, an ocean blue, but the shade is very close to Benjamin Moore’s Electric Blue. There’s an undercurrent of white elements in the room, including billowing curtains, ceramic lamps, an old leather armchair and a mid-century credenza with sliding doors that might hide an amount of clutter. Of course Carrie is totally unaware of our presence. “Hmm!” she exclaims, while she continues to click, click, click away at her computer, before she tilts <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, and then to the other “Hold it there, Sarah, beautiful. Now let your eyes drift to one side a little but don’t look at anything. You’re lost in that thought, whatever it is, as you start to lift your arm… no your right arm Sarah, lift your right arm above your head, and move your hand across your forehead, relax your fingers and yes - touch your eyebrow, it might loosen the thought. And it does the trick. “Now you’re ready to say the words that you’re already typing into the computer as you are thinking out-loud: “Hmm!

40|$|Students often hold a {{misconception}} or are completely uninformed {{as to what}} is Title IX. Currently, under Title IX, all students have the right to receive an education in an environment free from sex discrimination. Furthermore, {{it is the responsibility of}} the institution to take the necessary measures to comply with any student who chooses to file a report of gender discrimination. Title IX was implemented as a memorandum to promote gender equality, but over the years it has developed into not only a law but also an important piece of educational rights and standards. It is important to assess gender discrimination in relation to Title IX, because equality is the basis for this law. Each October, Chipotle, the chain southwestern burrito restaurant, offers a holiday special: come to any location dressed in a costume and receive a $ 3 burrito. My friends and I, broke college students at the time, quickly began coordinating lunch plans to take advantage of this unbeatable offer. However, of all the members in the group who were free at noon that day, I was not one of them. I remember sitting with my friends and politely declining the lunch date invitation and explaining how I interned until 2 : 00 p. m. that day.

40|$|Introduction In a red world {{bathed in}} shimmering gold light, a man sits {{with his head}} in his hand as wild beasts {{encircle}} him. He is emaciated, has unkempt hair, and wears only a waistcloth—but he has a dreamy smile on his face. Nearby, a camel bears a palanquin carrying a stately woman, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> tipped <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side, arm outstretched from the window of her traveling abode toward her lover. Beneath her, the signature “Work of Ghiyath” is woven in Kufic script inside an eightpointed star on the palanquin (Fig. 1). This depiction of the literary characters Layla and Majnun is one {{of a small group of}} figural textiles from the cache of fine luxury silks produced in Safavid Iran (1501 - 1722 CE). The red lampas metal-ground silk resides in the permanent collection of the Textile Museum in Washington, D. C. The designer of the textile, Ghiyath al-Din Ali of Yazd, was a Safavid court favorite whose fine silks were donned by the Iranian aristocracy at the turn of the seventeenth century. Additional Layla and Majnun textile designs include a second satin lampas by Ghiyath al-Din, as well as unsigned works whose techniques include double weave (Fig. 2) and velvet, in rich reds and metal-wrapped thread. All of the Layla and Majnun textiles known are dated 1580 - 1625, corresponding with the reign of the Safavid ruler Shah Abbas I (r. 1587 - 1629). The Safavids: Sufi Kings and Dervish Silk The appearance of these particular textiles during the reign of Shah Abbas is an indicator of the philosophy within the Shah’s court. Shah Abbas actively sought diplomatic alliances with European heads of state, and strove to present an exterior façade representing the wealth and power of his court. According to travelogues from Western visitors, the court of Shah Abbas in the capital city of Isfahan was resplendent with silk carpets and gold brocade textiles used for everything from soffreh cloths to garments and turbans...|$|R
6000|$|Shirley Keeldar (she had no Christian {{name but}} Shirley: her parents, who had wished {{to have a}} son, finding that, {{after eight years of}} marriage, Providence had granted them only a daughter, {{bestowed}} on her the same masculine family cognomen they would have bestowed on a boy, if with a boy they had been blessed)--Shirley Keeldar was no ugly heiress. She was agreeable to the eye. Her height and shape were not unlike Miss Helstone's; perhaps in stature she might have the advantage by an inch or two. She was gracefully made, and her face, too, possessed a charm as well described by the word grace as any other. It was pale naturally, but intelligent, and of varied expression. She was not a blonde, like Caroline. Clear and dark were the characteristics of her aspect as to colour. Her face and brow were clear, her eyes of the darkest gray (no green lights in them--transparent, pure, neutral gray), and her hair of the darkest brown. Her features were distinguished--by which I do not mean that they were high, bony, and Roman, being indeed rather small and slightly marked than otherwise, but only that they were, to use a few French words, [...] "fins, gracieux, spirituels"--mobile they were and speaking; but their changes were not to be understood nor their language interpreted all at once.

60|$|In {{expectation}} of the curate's visit, Mrs Clinton tidied {{the house and}} adorned herself. It {{has been said that}} she was a woman of taste, and so she was. The mantelpiece and looking glass were artistically draped with green muslin, and this she proceeded to arrange, tying and carefully forming the yellow satin ribbon with which it was relieved. The chairs were covered with cretonne which might have come from the Tottenham Court Road, and these she placed in positions of careless and artistic confusion, smoothing down the antimacassars which were now her pride, as the silk petticoat from which she had manufactured them had been once her glory. For the flower-pots she made fresh coverings of red tissue paper, re-arranged the ornaments gracefully scattered about on little Japanese tables; then, after pausing a moment to admire her work and see that nothing had been left undone, she went upstairs to perform her own toilet.... In less than half an hour she reappeared, holding herself in a dignified posture, with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> slightly turned <b>to</b> <b>one</b> side and her hands meekly folded in front of her, stately and collected as Juno, a goddess in black satin. Her dress was very elegant; it might have typified her own life, for in its original state of virgin whiteness it had been her wedding garment; then it was dyed purple, and might have betokened a sense of change and coming responsibilities; lastly it was black, to signify the burden of a family, and the seriousness of life. No one had realised so intensely as Mrs Clinton the truth of the poet's words. Life is not an empty dream. She took out her handkerchief, redolent with lascivious patchouli, and placed it in her bosom--a spot of whiteness against the black.... She sat herself down to wait.|$|R
