5|$|A {{major step}} forward {{in the study of}} {{bacteria}} came in 1977 when Carl Woese recognised that archaea <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> line of evolutionary descent from bacteria. This new phylogenetic taxonomy depended on the sequencing of 16S ribosomal RNA, and divided prokaryotes into two evolutionary domains, as part of the three-domain system.|$|E
5|$|Despite the affairs, Sharaf writes that, as the {{newspaper}} campaign against Reich gained pace, he developed an intense jealousy toward Lindenberg, demanding that she not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> life of any kind. He even physically assaulted a composer {{with whom she}} was working. Lindenberg considered calling the police but decided Reich could not afford another scandal. His behaviour took its toll on their relationship, and when Reich asked her to accompany him to the United States, she said no.|$|E
5|$|The game {{includes}} a research function. When new objects are {{encountered in the}} game, especially enemies, their organs can be collected and, when combined with chemicals found in storage rooms, the player can research the enemies and thus improve their damage against them. Similarly, some exotic weapons and items can only be used after being researched. OSA agents effectively <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> weapons tree available to them. Psionic powers can be learned, such as invisibility, fireballs, and teleportation.|$|E

5|$|Councils {{are divided}} into districts with {{leadership}} provided by the district executive, district chairman, and the district commissioner. Districts are directly responsible for the operation of Scouting units and, except for the district executive, are mostly staffed with volunteers. The voting members of each district consist of volunteer representatives from each chartered organization having at least one BSA unit, plus annually elected members-at-large who in turn elect the district chairman. Boroughs and districts are subdivisions of the local council and do not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> corporate status.|$|E
5|$|The Shia {{community}} of the Eastern province <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> legal tradition. Although they follow Sharia, they apply the Shia Jafari school of jurisprudence to it. In 1913, when Abdul Aziz conquered the area, he granted the Shias a separate judiciary for dealing with religious and family law cases: one judge in Qatif, and one in Al-Hasa. This remained the position, with the two judges ministering to a population of around two million, until 2005 {{when the number of}} judges was increased to seven. For all other areas of law, the Shia community are {{under the jurisdiction of the}} regular Sunni courts.|$|E
5|$|Their {{sense of}} smell, while {{much better than}} that of humans, {{is not quite as}} good as that of a dog. It is {{believed}} to {{play a key role in}} the social interactions of horses as well as detecting other key scents in the environment. Horses have two olfactory centers. The first system is in the nostrils and nasal cavity, which analyze a wide range of odors. The second, located under the nasal cavity, are the Vomeronasal organs, also called Jacobson's organs. These <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> nerve pathway to the brain and appear to primarily analyze pheromones.|$|E

5|$|Several other Privy Councils {{have advised}} the sovereign. England and Scotland once had {{separate}} Privy Councils (the Privy Council of England and Privy Council of Scotland). The Acts of Union 1707 united {{the two countries}} into the Kingdom of Great Britain and in 1708 the Parliament of Great Britain abolished the Privy Council of Scotland. Thereafter there was one Privy Council of Great Britain sitting in London. Ireland, on the other hand, continued to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> Privy Council even after the Act of Union 1800. The Privy Council of Ireland was abolished in 1922, when {{the southern part of}} Ireland separated from the United Kingdom; it was succeeded by the Privy Council of Northern Ireland, which became dormant after the suspension of the Parliament of Northern Ireland in 1972. No further appointments have been made since then, and only four appointees were still living as of May 2014.|$|E
5|$|Coronations may be {{performed}} {{for a person}} other than the reigning monarch. In 1170, Henry the Young King, heir apparent to the throne, was crowned as a second king of England, subordinate to his father HenryII; such coronations were common practice in mediaeval France and Germany, but this {{is only one of}} two instances of its kind in England (the other being that of Ecgfrith of Mercia in 796, crowned whilst his father, Offa of Mercia, was still alive). More commonly, a king's wife is crowned as queen consort. If the king is already married {{at the time of his}} coronation, a joint coronation of both king and queen may {{be performed}}. The first such coronation was of Henry II and Eleanor of Aquitaine in 1154; seventeen such coronations have been performed, including that of the co-rulers William III and MaryII. The most recent was that of GeorgeVI and the former Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon in 1937. If the king married, or remarried, after his coronation, or if his wife were not crowned with him for some other reason, she might be crowned in a separate ceremony. The first such separate coronation of a queen consort in England was that of Matilda of Flanders in 1068; the last was Anne Boleyn's in 1533. The most recent king to wed post-coronation, CharlesII, did not <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>separate</b> coronation for his bride, Catherine of Braganza. In some instances, the king's wife was simply unable to join him in the coronation ceremony due to circumstances preventing her from doing so. In 1821, George IV's estranged wife Caroline of Brunswick was prevented from being crowned with him and when she showed up at Westminster Abbey she was denied entry and turned away. Following the English Civil War, Oliver Cromwell declined the crown but underwent a coronation in all but name in his second investiture as Lord Protector in 1657. A Prince of Wales, usually the monarch's heir apparent, may also be crowned in a ceremony known as an investiture.|$|E
