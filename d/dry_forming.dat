Commercial nanosuspension with a primary particle size of 16 nm was concentrated to 55 wt% solids content using an electrosteric dispersant, β-alanine, whilst retaining low viscosities of ~ 20 mPa s at a 200 s- 1 shear rate. The nanosuspensions concentrated using the β-alanine also displayed good ageing resistance and it has been proven that a large scale vacuum assisted rotary evaporator can be used to perform concentration in industry.

40|$|Sheet {{metal forming}} is characterised by strong {{frictional}} forces involving {{an increase of}} the temperature and a tendency to adhesion. Consequently, use of lubricants is essential yet, especially for forming of Aluminium alloys. Furthermore, lubricant reduces tool wear. However, for economical and ecological reasons, <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> is highly desired. Avoiding the application of lubrication requires a reduction of the coefficient of friction and the tendency for adhesion in <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> processes. One approach {{is to increase the}} nominal surface pressure by micro structuring the tool. Additionally, different carbon based layers (a]C:H:Si and CVD diamond) are applied on the tool to reduce wear and tendency to adhesion. For using a a]C:H:Si layer, uncoated steel drawing tools are micro structured with calottes by milling. Because of a higher thickness of CVD diamond layers, calottes have to be generated directly in the coating using ablating processes like electrical discharge machining. To emulate the tribological system of a sheet metal forming process and characterise it, strip drawing tests are done. For a]C:H:Si coated drawing tools, the test results show a significant reduction of the coefficient of friction in micro structured, compared to polished drawing tools. To further increase the wear resistance of the tool it is intended to apply CVD diamond layers on steel tools as soon as the process is operational...|$|E
40|$|Avoiding {{negative}} effects of conventional lubrication in forming operations stimulates research on lubricant free forming processes. Increased friction and wear due to direct contact between tool and workpiece surface lead to insufficient forming results in <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> operations. Dry deep drawing of rectangular cups with conventional tools reveals cracks and wrinkles. This necessitates the development of tool sided surface modifications which face the challenges of lubricant free forming. As former results of tribological investigations have shown, adhesion is the dominant friction and wear mechanism. Therefore, diamond-like carbon coatings are applied to decrease adhesion. The mechanical properties of a-C:H:W- and ta-C-coatings are systematically analyzed to reduce friction and wear. Additionally, micro features are generated by laser texturing of a-C:H:W coatings to control material flow by locally adapted frictional conditions. The effects of different feature edge geometries and the feature orientation are investigated in ring-on-disc tribometer tests. Depending on the deposition parameters some a-C:H:W coating variants show reduction of adhesion for DC 04. However, in contact with aluminum alloys no improve of tribological conditions could be achieved. ta-C coatings affect the reduction of friction and wear in contact with DC 04 and aluminum and show high potential for application in <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> processes. Depending on adhesion affinity of the workpiece material, micro features can increase friction by adjusting their edge geometry, orientation and area coverage. The tribological behavior of selected surface modifications is finally analyzed in the strip drawing test. The obtained results gain basic knowledge for development of surface modifications towards realization of lubricant free deep drawing by a tailored tool concept...|$|E

40|$|Self-bonding of {{air-dried}} undebarked cotton stalks during {{hot pressing}} in a closely fitting mold was studied. Advanced board-like green nanocomposites from ground undebarked cotton stalks were introduced {{for the first}} time in the present work. The <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> process was adopted. Moderate molding pressure and temperature were selected and applied in a tight die, thus saving water and energy and avoiding the use of any binders to achieve an environment-friendly green product. Green nanocomposites having densities in the range of 1. 27 – 1. 29 g/cm 3 and 1. 03 – 1. 06 g/cm 3 were prepared. Particle size and cell wall morphological structure were found to play a major role in self-bonding. Properties of composites prepared from the fine fraction of cotton stalks were superior to those prepared from the cotton stalk coarse fraction at the same conditions. This is attributed—among other things—to the dominance of pith (parenchymal cells) in the fine fraction. Such cells possess a high lumen-to-cell wall ratio, which renders them more deformable under pressure, leading to more intercellular or interparticle bonding. Advanced binderless green nanocomposites having bending strength as high as 637 kg/cm 2 and water absorption as low as 12. 1 % were obtained from the ground undebarked cotton stalks. The results show clearly that the advanced green nanocomposite obtained by the <b>dry</b> <b>forming</b> process, without the addition of any binders, is superior to hardboard obtained from cotton stalks by the conventional wet web formation process.

Various caron-based coatings, prepared by PECVD (RF and pulsed-DC mode) and by reactive DC magnetron sputtering have been investigated with respect to hardness, abrasive wear resistance, adhesion properties and tribological behaviour under forming conditions. The softer and less wear-resistant coatings exhibited the lowest adhesive wear and friction against aluminium and stainless-steel counterparts. Application tests with coated tools were carried out under near production conditions.
