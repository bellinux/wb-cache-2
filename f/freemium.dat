25|$|Free-to-play (F2P or FtP) {{refers to}} video games which give players {{access to a}} {{significant}} portion of their content without paying. There are several kinds of free-to-play games, but the most common is based on the <b>freemium</b> software model, thus free-to-play games are oftentimes not entirely free. For <b>freemium</b> games, users are granted access to a fully functional game, but must pay microtransactions to access additional content. Free-to-play can be contrasted with pay to play, in which payment is required before using a service for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The {{most popular}} and {{effective}} strategy to counter piracy {{is to change the}} business model to <b>Freemium,</b> where gamers pay for their in-game needs or service. Strong server-side security is required for this, to properly distinguish authentic transactions from hacked (faked) transactions.|$|E
25|$|SimCity BuildIt is {{a remake}} of SimCity 2013 for iOS and Android mobile devices. It is a <b>freemium</b> game, {{which means that the}} player can play without buying virtual currency, {{although}} they can use real money to speed up progress. It has 3D graphics and similar gameplay {{to the rest of the}} series, adding social media features to interact with other players.|$|E

A reboot to the Dungeon Keeper series, players construct and manage a dungeon, recruiting minions to run it, although the gameplay has a tower defence style, featuring frequent raids of others' dungeons and the defence of the player's. Players {{can participate in}} tournaments and leagues online.|$|E

With a worldwide membership and a <b>freemium</b> business model, the website claims millions of caches and members in over 200 countries. Hides and events are reviewed by volunteer regional cache reviewers before publication. Free membership allows users access to coordinates, descriptions, and logs for some caches; for a fee, users are allowed additional search tools, {{the ability to}} download large amounts of cache information onto their gps at once, instant email notifications about new caches, and access to premium-member-only caches.|$|E
25|$|Pokémon Go is a free-to-play, location-based {{augmented}} reality game developed by Niantic for iOS and Android devices. The game {{was the result}} of a collaboration between Niantic and Nintendo, by way of The Pokémon Company, and was initially released in selected countries in July 2016. The game utilizes the player's mobile device's GPS ability to locate, capture, battle, and train virtual creatures, called Pokémon, which appear on the screen as if they were at the same real-world location as the player. The game features a <b>freemium</b> business model and supports in-app purchases for additional in-game items.|$|E

The software {{is available to}} download onto computers running Windows, Mac or Linux, as well as Android and iOS smartphones and tablets. Since 2014, HipChat has used a <b>freemium</b> model, {{as much of the}} service is free with some additional features requiring organizations to pay per month. HipChat was launched in 2010 and acquired by Atlassian in 2012. In September 2017 Atlassian replaced the cloud-based HipChat with a new cloud product called Stride, with HipChat continuing on as the client-hosted HipChat Data Center.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{have noted}} that Windows10 heavily {{emphasizes}} <b>freemium</b> services, and contains various advertising facilities. Some outlets have considered these to be a hidden [...] "cost" [...] of the free upgrade offer. Examples include media storefronts, Office 365, paid functionality in bundled games such as Microsoft Solitaire Collection, default settings that display promotions of [...] "suggested" [...] apps in Start menu and [...] "tips" [...] on the lock screen that may contain advertising, ads displayed in File Explorer for Office 365 subscriptions on Creators' Update, and various advertising notifications promoting the Microsoft Edge web browser {{when it is not}} set as default.|$|E
500|$|Numerous {{video games}} {{based on the}} series have been produced. Some of the early games include [...] (2001) and [...] (2003). The 2003 video game {{was added to the}} Greatest Hits by Sony. It also served as the engine basis for a video game based on The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie. Heavy Iron Studios, the game's developers, tweaked the {{graphics}} to give the game a sharper and more imaginative look than that of Battle for Bikini Bottom. They also increased the polygon count, added several racing levels, and incorporated many of the creatures seen in the film. In 2013, Nickelodeon published and distributed SpongeBob Moves In!, a <b>freemium</b> city-building game app developed by Kung Fu Factory for iOS.|$|E
500|$|It’s a rerelease of {{a nine-year-old}} game that quietly smuggled microtransactions into its online mode, and I can’t believe a concept so ludicrous {{is a real}} thing. That’s {{something}} a parody of the industry would come up with. It’s one thing to see the sad normalization of fee-to-pay elements within brand new releases, but to witness them shoveled retroactively into an old beloved title from an age before such trash gained traction? Activision has set the bar for “AAA” avarice – a new height for greed and a new low for the games business overall. [...] Most remasters are sold as complete, definitive editions of the original games, packing in all the downloadable content and expansions that may have followed the initial launch. COD4 is {{paving the way for}} publishers to triple down – not just make money by selling an old game with updated visuals, but by tacking on DLC and microtransactions too. Should this pay off, I’ve little doubt that other publishers will attempt it themselves. [...] The rampant, unchecked greed on display is almost impressive in its audacity. To sneak <b>freemium</b> bullshit into a nine-year-old game that leveraged its own fandom to sell a completely different game is a masterstroke of sliminess, a monument to Bobby Kotick’s notorious lack of shame.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Freemium</b> games, such as , , and Rift, {{offer the}} [...] "full version" [...] {{of a product}} free of charge, while users are charged micropayments to access premium {{features}} and virtual goods, often in a piecemeal fashion.|$|E
2500|$|In October 2013, Jeff Skalski of Mythic Entertainment, which {{produced}} a free-to-play remake of Dungeon Keeper on mobile platforms, {{said he would}} like to remake other Bullfrog titles, and described the company as [...] "unstoppable". Theme Park also received a <b>freemium</b> remake in December 2011.|$|E
2500|$|An {{example of}} a much more {{controlled}} market is World of Tanks [...] "gold", a virtual currency which is only available from the vendor itself and typically only for cash payment. This has become {{a model for other}} <b>freemium</b> games. It does not allow for any vending of game goods or capabilities without the permission and direct participation and control of the game server/operator/vendor.|$|E
2500|$|A {{social network}} game called Sword Art Online: End World was {{released}} for Japanese feature phones and smartphones on February 28, 2013 {{with more than}} 1 million registered users. Another <b>freemium</b> game for Android and iOS titled [...] launched in 2014, and over 3,000,000 users have downloaded the game. Another game called Sword Art Online: Progress Link designed for the Mobage browser game platform on smartphones was released on February 10, 2015. In 2016, Bandai Namco released Sword Art Online: Memory Defrag for Android and iOS.|$|E
2500|$|Reception was {{not universally}} negative. Chris Carter of Destructoid gave a mediocre review. Although he criticized the waiting times and microtransactions, he commented that raiding other dungeons can be fun. Harry Slater of Pocket Gamer {{described}} {{the game as}} a [...] "well polished Clash of Clans clone", although he criticized the waiting times. Nathan Meunier of MacLife lauded the [...] "addictive" [...] construction and [...] "wacky" [...] humour, but criticized the frequency of in-app purchases. Slide to Play described the game as [...] "not too bad" [...] for a <b>freemium</b> game employing in-app purchases. Stephen Yuen of AndroidSPIN stated that the game needs patience, but praised the graphics and sound.|$|E
2500|$|Pointing to the {{disruptive}} effect of free-to-play on current models, IGN editor Charles Onyett has said [...] "expensive, one-time purchases are facing extinction". He {{believes that the}} current method of paying a one-time fee for most games will eventually disappear completely. Greg Zeschuk of BioWare believes {{there is a good}} possibility that free-to-play would become the dominant pricing plan for games, but that it was very unlikely that it would ever completely replace subscription-based games. Developers such as Electronic Arts have pointed to the success of <b>freemium,</b> saying that microtransactions will inevitably be part of every game. While noting the success of some developers with the model, companies such as Nintendo have remained skeptical of free-to-play, preferring to stick to more traditional models of game development and sales.|$|E
2500|$|The Sims FreePlay, a <b>freemium</b> {{version of}} The Sims for iPhone, iPod Touch, iPad, Android phones (and tablets), and Kindle Fire, was {{released}} worldwide on December 15, 2011 for iOS devices, and on February 15, 2012 for Android. The game {{made it to}} Kindle Fire in October 2012 and to BlackBerry 10 on July 31, 2013. Unlike other Sims games, The Sims FreePlay runs in real-time and takes real time to complete actions. Players can progress through 55 levels and unlock new content, create up to 34 Sims, build town map buildings, complete goals to earn Lifestyle Points, Simoleons, Social Points, and XP (Experience Points). All of these,(except for Social Points) can be get by baking, [...] planting, going to school (Only for preteen and teens) or going to work. To get Social Points, {{you will need to}} go to neighbouring houses or add your Facebook friends.|$|E
2500|$|In May 2007, Fairfax Media {{announced}} it would be moving from a broadsheet format to the smaller compact or tabloid-size, {{in the footsteps of}} The Times, for both The Sydney Morning Herald and The Age. Fairfax Media dumped these plans later in the year. However, in June 2012, Fairfax Media again {{announced it}} planned to shift both broadsheet newspapers to tabloid size, in March 2013. Fairfax also {{announced it would}} cut staff across the entire group by 1,900 over three years and erect paywalls around the papers' websites. The subscription type is to be a <b>freemium</b> model, limiting readers to a number of free stories per month, with a payment required for further access. The announcement was part of an overall [...] "digital first" [...] strategy of increasingly digital or on-line content over printed delivery, to [...] "increase sharing of editorial content", and to assist the managements wish for [...] "full integration of its online, print and mobile platforms".|$|E
2500|$|In single player games, {{another concern}} is the {{tendency}} for free games to constantly request that the player buy extra content, {{in a similar vein}} to nagware and trialware's frequent demands for the user to 'upgrade'. Payment may be required in order to survive or continue in the game, annoying or distracting the player from the experience. Some psychologists, such as Mark D. Griffiths, have criticized the mechanics of <b>freemium</b> games as exploitative, drawing direct parallels to gambling addiction. Furthermore, the ubiquitous and often intrusive use of microtransactions in free-to-play games have sometimes caused children to either inadvertently or deliberately pay for large amounts of virtual goods, often for drastically high amounts of real money. In February 2013, Eurogamer reported that Apple had agreed to refund a British family £1700.41 after their son had racked up countless microtransactions whilst playing the F2P game Zombies vs. Ninjas. In February 2015 Apple began featuring popular non-freemium software on the App Store as [...] "Pay Once & Play", describing them as [...] "Great Games with No In-App Purchases ... hours of uninterrupted fun with complete experiences".|$|E
2500|$|The network's website {{remained}} somewhat {{active in}} the latter {{two years of the}} network's existence, though features have been removed with the network's decline. The site was not updated to modern navigational or visual styles, and G4 never took up any TV Everywhere initiatives allowing viewing of the network's programs on the site with cable provider credentials. The network maintained a now-defunct iOS app featuring access to the website and forums. The network's forums ceased operation on March 18, 2013. The site was rarely updated outside of automated programming guide listings (until December 31, 2014) and advertising previews for films and games that were long released, and the channel list was frozen with channel positions as of the original April 2013 planned date of the Esquire transition. Other effects of the dormancy of the website included an updated 'top story' on February 18, 2014, advertising a <b>freemium</b> branded game platform known as [...] "G4Now", interlining with sister network Syfy's gaming service SyfyGames.com. The site's [...] "breaking news" [...] alert tag was later used to promote Syfy or Esquire Network programming rather than any actual breaking news.|$|E
2500|$|Schaeffer was {{eventually}} persuaded to adapt his book How Should We Then Live? The Rise and Decline of Western Thought and Culture to film by Gospel Films, Inc. by CEO and executive evangelical media producer Billy Zeoli who pitched {{the idea of}} hiring Schaeffer's then recently married son, teenage father, and painter Frank Schaeffer as a producer for the film project. [...] Zeoli was instrumental in providing the Schaeffers with introductions to wealthy American evangelicals who would eventually bankroll the How We Should Then Live film project. This book is still being read and used today in American Universities {{as well as in}} various small group studies to help shed light on the contemporary cultural problems of the past and how they have led to many of the issues that America is facing today. Issues such as race, apathy, abortion, and the non-compassionate use of wealth are topics still relevant today. Schaeffer argues that the humanist base for morals is fundamentally a weak base upon which to build a moral framework for society. By contrast, the Bible, understood as the revealed revelation from God is able to provide a fundamentally sound basis for societal norms as well as a base for science. The president of Christian Leaders Institute (CLI), [...] Henry Reyenga Jr., secured rights to post this film series in an ethics class at CLI. This <b>freemium</b> ministry training school lists [...] "deceased" [...] Francis Schaeffer on its faculty.|$|E
