LAPD Detective Monica Reese (Christine Lahti) at first questions Derek's fidelity to Sharon as well, but soon becomes skeptical of Lisa's claims, due to inconsistencies in her side of the story, and informs Derek of her belief in him. Sharon, refusing to believe Derek, kicks him out of their house, and he moves into a separate apartment. Months later, Derek and Sharon meet up for dinner and finally reconcile. Meanwhile, Lisa tricks the babysitter Samantha (Scout Taylor-Compton) into letting her in under the pretense of being one of Sharon's friends. When Derek and Sharon return home after dinner, they discover that Lisa had been in the house and seemingly abducted Derek and Sharon's infant son, Kyle (Nathan and Nicolas Myers). Derek goes to his car with the intent to pursue Lisa, only to find the baby is safely sitting in the back seat. He and Sharon immediately take Kyle to the hospital for a check-up. When Derek and Sharon return <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> they find Lisa has trashed their bedroom and removed Sharon's face from their family portrait. Sharon leaves a threatening voice message on Lisa's phone, and she and Derek set up a home alarm system.|$|E
5|$|Police interviewed Farrar at 6:20 a.m, informing him {{immediately}} that {{the bodies of}} Tim and Kelly had been recovered. He told police about the deterioration of his marriage and health {{over the past six}} months. In August 1995, Farrar had fallen ill with nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea. He initially assumed it was a residual effect of the traveler's diarrhea many people on the Peru trip had contracted while there. Though he recovered from the initial bout of symptoms, he relapsed about a week later, and on August 18 Farrar was hospitalized with severe dehydration and high fever. In the hospital, he developed sepsis. Doctors identified Streptococcus viridans, which had probably leaked through damaged digestive tissue as a result of Farrar's severe diarrhea, as the source of the sepsis; however, they could not pinpoint the root cause of the gastrointestinal illness itself. Though Farrar's illness was severe and possibly life-threatening, he eventually recovered and was released from the hospital on August 25. That night, however, shortly after eating a dinner that Green had served him, Farrar again suffered vomiting and diarrhea and had to be hospitalized. A third bout of symptoms struck on September 4, days after he was released from the hospital for the second time. Basing their conclusions on the likelihood that his illness was related to the Peru trip, doctors narrowed down the possible causes for Farrar's gastrointestinal issues to a handful, though none fitted his symptoms perfectly: typhoid fever, tropical sprue, or gluten-sensitive enteropathy. Farrar had noticed that each time he returned <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> he became ill again almost immediately, and he speculated that it may have been due to the stress of his dissolving marriage or the change from a bland hospital diet to a normal home one. When Farrar's girlfriend, Margaret Hacker, told him she suspected Green was poisoning him, he initially wrote off the idea as ridiculous.|$|E

However, when he confesses the depths of his need and want for her, she becomes scared and runs from him; Lucas is left heartbroken and desperate. Peyton later goes to visit Lucas and professes that she wants what he wants, but it is too late; Brooke, her best friend, has now become romantically involved with Lucas. Lucas and Peyton eventually cannot resist each other, romantic-wise, and become secret lovers (though no sex is involved). On the night that they decide to tell Brooke, Lucas gets into a car accident and subsequently goes into a coma, which brings back painful memories for Peyton because her mother died in a car crash. When Lucas finally comes <b>home</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital,</b> he breaks up with Brooke in order to be with Peyton. Peyton soon ends their affair, however, after it is clear that Brooke has found out about the romance and she wants to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton continues to avoid Lucas while Brooke continues to avoid Peyton. Brooke declares her friendship with Peyton to be over. Peyton begins spending more time with Luke's best friend, Haley James, and with Jake Jagielski, along with Jake's daughter, Jenny. Eventually, her friendship with Lucas is slowly reformed, and the two attend a party together at Nathan's apartment. However, at the party, Peyton and Nicki, Jake's ex and Jenny's mother, fight. Peyton realizes Nicki is the girl Lucas hooked up with at a bar, shortly after she dumped him to spare Brooke's pain. Peyton is furious and feels betrayed, along with Brooke. This draws a wedge between Lucas and Peyton, but reconciles the friendship between Peyton and Brooke. The season ends with Peyton spending more time with Jake, and helping him escape from Nicki, who tries to take their daughter from Jake's grasp. Peyton's relationship with Lucas remains broken.|$|E

Though she initially claimed {{that she was going to}} plant them, when pressed she said that she intended to use them to commit suicide. Green's drinking was especially heavy that day, and as her behavior grew stranger, Farrar contacted the police for assistance in placing Green into psychiatric care. Police who responded to the home described Farrar and the children as [...] "shaken" [...] and Green's behavior as [...] "bizarre". Though Green did not seem to hold the police's presence against them and gave them no resistance, she denied being suicidal and called Farrar a series of obscenities. Farrar showed police the seed packets and other items he had found in her purse the day before, and the police transported Green to a nearby emergency room. The physician who attended her there found Green to be smelling strongly of alcohol, but not visibly drunk. Though Green appeared unkempt, the doctor felt her demeanor was not unusual for someone going through a bitter divorce and noted that Green professed no desire to hurt herself or others when the doctor interviewed her privately. However, when Farrar came into view in the hospital, Green's demeanor changed.

40|$|Abstract Background: Appropriate {{management}} of care – for example, avoiding unnecessary attendances at, or admissions to, hospital emergency units {{when they could}} be handled in primary care – {{is an important part}} of health strategy. However, some variations in these outcomes could be due to genuine variations in health need. This paper proposes a new method of explaining variations in hospital utilisation across small areas and the general practices (GPs) responsible for patient primary care. By controlling for the influence of true need on such variations, one may identify remaining sources of excess emergency attendances and admissions, both at area and practice level, that may be related to the quality, resourcing or organisation of care. The present paper accordingly develops a methodology that recognises the interplay between population mix factors (health need) and primary care factors (e. g. referral thresholds), that allows for unobserved influences on hospitalisation usage, and that also reflects interdependence between hospital outcomes. A case study considers relativities in attendance and admission rates at a North London hospital involving 149 small areas and 53 GP practices. Results: A fixed effects model shows variations in attendances and admissions are significantly related (positively) to area and practice need, and nursing home patients, and related (negatively) to primary care access and distance of patient <b>homes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Modelling <b>the</b> impact of known factors alone is not sufficient to produce a satisfactory fit to the observations, and random effects at area and practice level are needed to improve fit and account for overdispersion. Conclusion: The case study finds variation in attendance and admission rates across areas and practices after controlling for need, and remaining differences between practices may be attributable to referral behaviour unrelated to need, or to staffing, resourcing, and access issues. In managerial terms, the analysis points to the utility of formal statistical analysis of hospitalisation rates as a prelude to non-statistical investigation of primary care resourcing and organisation. For example, there may be implications for the location of staff involved in community {{management of}} chronic conditions; health managers may also investigate whether some practices have unusual populations (homeless, asylum seekers, students) that explain different hospital use patterns. </p...|$|R

[...] However, [...] "On Friends, it was a stroke of genius that made both characters more appealing while providing a needed diversion from the show's central task: Retaining a romantic equilibrium between Ross and Rachel." [...] Monica and Chandler's relationship is the antithesis of Ross and Rachel's because it remained [...] "healthy and strong until the series ended", while the other couple was relentlessly on-and-off. Encyclopedia of Television author Horace Newcomb believes that Monica's feelings for Chandler are responsible for curing the latter's fear of commitment. Similarly, Slate writer Ruth Graham {{observed that}} [...] "Chandler is painted as a self-loathing loser with women, until he finally snags Monica at the end of Season 4." [...] Meanwhile, Silveri believes that Friends ultimately ran as long as it did due in part to Monica and Chandler's romance, explaining, [...] "if the center of Friends had remained Ross and Rachel, you would've seen a much shorter shelf life for the show"; Monica and Chandler's arc is believed to have extended the series by approximately three years.

40|$|Chronic {{kidney disease}} (CKD) in {{children}} {{has become a}} public health problem in Ghana. The researcher observed that the primary care givers of these children present them late for medical care. This ignited the researcher to conduct this study to identify {{factors that contribute to}} primary care givers' delay in seeking early medical care for children with CKD. The {{purpose of the study was}} to explore and describe the factors that contribute to primary care givers' delay in presenting children who suffer from CKD for medical care in Ghana. A descriptive qualitative design was used to answer the research question: What factors contribute to primary care givers' delay in presenting children with CKD for medical care in Ghana? Convenience sampling was used to recruit ten primary care givers of children admitted for CKD at the Paediatric Renal Unit of Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana, to participate in the study. Semi-structured interviews and field notes were used to collect data. The thematic data analysis approach of Colaizzi (1978) was used, and the ecological model of Schneider (2017) assisted in organising themes and subthemes. The themes which emerged are: intrapersonal-related factors contributing to delay; interpersonal-related factors contributing to delay; community-related factors contributing to delay; and political-related factors contributing to delay. These were directly related to the research question. A fifth theme which emerged serendipitously is the perceived need for community awareness about CKD. The findings revealed that intrapersonal, interpersonal, community and political level factors influence primary care givers' decisions in seeking medical care for their children. At intrapersonal level factors that played a role were personal attitudes and beliefs; primary care givers' beliefs in traditional medicine as a cure for CKD; their lack of knowledge on CKD and its management; primary care givers' financial constraints; and their beliefs in ancestral spiritual powers for healing. At interpersonal level factors included primary care givers' lack of family support and marital conflicts. At community level factors included primary care givers' delayed referral <b>from</b> <b>the</b> local health facility; incorrect advice received from family and neighbours on management; mismanagement of the disease at the local health facility; and misdiagnosis by neighbours. At political level the distance of the primary care givers' <b>homes</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital</b> can contribute to delays. One of the recommendations of the study is development and implementation of a national referral policy for CKD patients to guide health practitioners at the districts. Early referral for appropriate treatment of children with CKD can slow progression of the disease and prevent early mortality. Awareness campaigns need to be developed and implemented by the Ghana Kidney Association to provide health educational programmes for health professionals and communities. Further research using a larger sample or quantitative research methods is also recommended, to gain a better understanding of the factors contributing to delays in presentation of children with CKD in Ghana...|$|R

Study children were followed for 12 weeks following their discharge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital.</b> Results: 405 eligible children were enrolled, with a median age of 10 months. Bacterial pathogens were isolated from blood culture in 18 (4. 4 %) children, of which 72 % were Gram negatives. Tuberculosis was confirmed microbiologically in 7 % (27 / 396) of children that provided sputum- 10 by culture, 21 by Xpert MTB/RIF assay, and 4 by both tests. <b>The</b> diagnostic yield <b>from</b> induced sputum was 6 % compared to 3. 5 % from gastric aspirate. Sixty (16 %) additional children had tuberculosis diagnosed clinically that was not microbiologically confirmed. Most confirmed tuberculosis cases did not have a positive contact history or positive tuberculin test. The sensitivity and specificity of Xpert MTB/RIF assay compared to culture was 67 % (95 % CI: 24 – 94) and 92 % (95 % CI: 87 – 95) respectively. Overall case-fatality rate was 17 % and half of the deaths occurred in <b>home</b> following discharge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>hospital...</b>|$|R
