25|$|Robin is {{devastated by}} her cousin Georgie's (Lindze Letherman) death in December 2007. After Georgie's funeral and Maxie's (Kirsten Storms) horrible {{outburst}} at Felicia (Kristina Wagner), she seeks comfort in Patrick's arms, because he truly knows her and sees {{her as she}} truly is, and tells him {{that it is not}} about getting back together, or a baby or even sex, but that she just wants him to hold her. Caught in a moment, they <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>making</b> love. That night, a condom breaks and Robin becomes pregnant, although she is unaware of this until weeks later. Dr. Kelly Lee tells Robin that the date of conception would have to be sometime around Christmas, which was around the time when Patrick and Robin had sex. Robin, worried that Patrick now has HIV, is about to tell him, but when she walks into the locker room she hears Dr. Julian tell Patrick that the HIV test he took (after he realizes that the condom had broken when he and Robin had sex) has come back negative. With the news that Patrick is not infected, Robin makes up her mind not to tell Patrick about the pregnancy just yet. Robin later blurts out to Patrick that she is pregnant, but leaves out {{the fact that he is}} the father. She tells him that she went to a sperm bank and that she does not know who her baby's father is. Although he thinks she is having a baby with someone else, Patrick cannot stay away from Robin or her child. After several occurrences, Patrick slowly realizes that he may in fact be the father of her baby. After they have a heart to heart, however, and Patrick asks about the paternity of the baby. Robin admits he is the father. But even though she is pregnant, Robin cannot let go of the fact that he never wanted children. Arguments and resentment builds from both sides- Patrick wanting to be a part of his child's life, Robin telling him it's her baby that he never wanted. Eventually, being confronted by her past—remembering how wrong she believed Carly was to keep baby Michael's paternity from AJ (Billy Warlock), or even her own mother keeping her away from her father the first 6 years of her life—Patrick and Robin forgave one another and started the movement up again in their own relationship. Over time, Patrick and Robin grow even closer and Patrick falls even more in love with Robin, and with the child he never wanted.|$|E

While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was just hard work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>making</b> the Christmas album".|$|E
500|$|In 1992, National Basketball Association (NBA) players {{participated in}} the 1992 Summer Olympics. The American [...] "Dream Team" [...] {{dominated}} the tournament, and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman (an NBA executive in 1992) commented that the [...] "'s worldwide awareness grew dramatically". He hoped that NHL participation would [...] "get exposure like the world has never seen for hockey". The typical NBA season is held {{in the winter and}} spring, so the Summer Olympics do not conflict with the regular season schedule. Bettman [...] "floated a concept of moving hockey to the Summer Games", but this was rejected because of the Olympic Charter. In March 1995, Bettman, René Fasel, IOC president Juan Antonio Samaranch and NHLPA executive director Bob Goodenow met in Geneva, Switzerland. They reached an agreement that allowed NHL players to participate in the Olympics, starting with the 1998 Games in Nagano, Japan. The deal was officially announced by the NHL on October 2, 1995.

500|$|Furlan {{is said to}} {{have asked}} for her {{character}} to be written out of the series because {{she did not want to}} travel to Hawaii to film her scenes, although she later called this an untrue rumor. [...] The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot, with the possibility of her returning in season five. [...] Co-show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four, however as a result of the Writer's Strike, this did not come to pass. When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five, Lindelof said that Rousseau's story would [...] "definitively" [...] be revealed, but that [...] "to use the word flashback would be disingenuous". Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were [...] "embracing a whole new word". He explained that [...] "there will still [...] be flashbacks and flash-forwards on the show, but we're going to do something different this year. We're going to mix it up." [...] Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons, stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time. The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season, but Furlan did not <b>end</b> <b>up</b> <b>making</b> an appearance. [...] However, she returns in the form of Rousseau's [...] "sideways" [...] counterpart (who never crashed on the Island, lost Alex or went insane) in the sixth season.|$|E

2500|$|Following her {{departure}} from The Lucy Show {{at the end}} of the third season, Vance signed on to appear in a Blake Edwards film, The Great Race; she saw this as an opportunity to restart a movie career, which never really took off. The film was a moderate success, receiving several Academy Award nominations; however, it did little to help her establish a career as a movie actress. Vance was slated to make her return to Broadway in the Woody Allen comedy Don't Drink the Water. However, she left the play during its out-of-town tryouts, later saying she felt the role was not right for her and asking the show's producers to be let out of her contract.
