5|$|A related {{experiment}} {{which also}} had Teller's endorsement {{was a plan}} to extract oil from the tar sands in northern Alberta with nuclear explosions, titled Project Oilsands. The plan actually received {{the endorsement of the}} Alberta government, but was rejected by the Government of Canada under Prime Minister John Diefenbaker, who was opposed to having any nuclear weapons in Canada. After Diefenbaker was out of office, Canada went on to <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, from a US nuclear sharing agreement, from 1963 to 1984.|$|E
5|$|Documents {{discovered}} in Weizsäcker's office, Fleischmann's laboratory and the Strasbourg Hospital pointed to nuclear activities {{taking place at}} Stadtilm, Haigerloch, Hechingen, and Tailfingen. After establishing its headquarters in von Haagen's office Alsos staff uncovered documents concerning secret medical experiments at Natzweiler concentration camp. These indicated the Germans {{had been unable to}} develop a practical process for uranium enrichment. For the first time the Alsos Mission was able to categorically report that the Germans did not <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons, and would not have them for some time.|$|E
5|$|Bromine has two stable isotopes, 79Br and 81Br. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes, with 79Br making up 51% of natural bromine and 81Br {{making up the}} {{remaining}} 49%. Both <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> spin 3/2− and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although 81Br is more favourable. The other bromine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature. Of these, the most important are 80Br (t1/2 = 17.7min), 80mBr (t1/2 = 4.421h), and 82Br (t1/2 = 35.28h), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural bromine. The most stable bromine radioisotope is 77Br (t1/2 = 57.04h). The primary decay mode of isotopes lighter than 79Br is electron capture to isotopes of selenium; that of isotopes heavier than 81Br is beta decay to isotopes of krypton; and 80Br may decay by either mode to stable 80Se or 80Kr.|$|E

5|$|Chlorine has two stable {{isotopes}}, 35Cl and 37Cl. These are {{its only}} two natural isotopes occurring in quantity, with 35Cl making up 76% of natural chlorine and 37Cl {{making up the}} remaining 24%. Both are synthesised in stars in the oxygen-burning and silicon-burning processes. Both <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> spin 3/2+ and thus {{may be used for}} nuclear magnetic resonance, although the spin magnitude being greater than 1/2 results in non-spherical nuclear charge distribution and thus resonance broadening {{as a result of a}} nonzero nuclear quadrupole moment and resultant quadrupolar relaxation. The other chlorine isotopes are all radioactive, with half-lives too short to occur in nature primordially. Of these, the most commonly used in the laboratory are 36Cl (t1/2 = 3.0×105y) and 38Cl (t1/2 = 37.2min), which may be produced from the neutron activation of natural chlorine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, the W23, an {{adaptation}} of the W19 nuclear artillery shell was developed specifically for the 16-inch guns. The shell had an estimated yield of , and its introduction made the Iowa-class battleship's 16-inch guns the world's largest nuclear artillery, and made these four battleships the only US Navy ships ever to <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> shells for naval guns. Although developed for exclusive use by the battleship's guns {{it is not known}} if any of the Iowas actually carried these shells while in active service due to the United States Navy's policy of refusing to confirm or deny the presence of nuclear weaponry aboard its ships. In 1991 the United States unilaterally withdrew all of its nuclear artillery shells from service, and dismantling of the US nuclear artillery inventory {{is said to have been}} completed in 2004.|$|E
5|$|The glass forms include {{borosilicate}} {{glasses and}} phosphate glasses. Borosilicate nuclear waste glasses are used on an industrial scale to immobilize high level radioactive waste {{in many countries}} which are producers of nuclear energy or <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> weaponry. The glass waste forms {{have the advantage of}} being able to accommodate a wide variety of waste-stream compositions, they are easy to scale up to industrial processing, and they are stable against thermal, radiative, and chemical perturbations. These glasses function by binding radioactive elements to nonradioactive glass-forming elements. Phosphate glasses while not being used industrially have much lower dissolution rates than borosilicate glasses, which make them a more favorable option. However, no single phosphate material has the ability to accommodate all of the radioactive products so phosphate storage requires more reprocessing to separate the waste into distinct fractions. Both glasses have to be processed at elevated temperatures making them unusable for some of the more volatile radiotoxic elements.|$|E

25|$|Calculations {{according}} to the Hartree–Fock–Bogoliubov Method using the non-relativistic Skyrme interaction have proposed Z = 126 as a closed proton shell. In this region of the periodic table, N = 184 and N = 196 have been suggested as closed neutron shells. Therefore, the isotopes of most interest are 310Ubh and 322Ubh, for these might be considerably longer-lived than other isotopes. Element 126, having a magic number of protons, is predicted to be more stable than other elements in this region, and may <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> isomers with very long half-lives.|$|E

In addition to this, following SDSC's Biology Workbench's SAPS kNN-Prediction, the CXorf66 protein for humans and the mouse homolog have a 47.8% likelihood to end up in the nuclear region of a cell. For more distant homologs, like Bos taurus, that do not <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> localization signals however, CXorf66 has a 34.8% likelihood to end up in the extracellular, including cell wall region, or plasma membrane regions.

Additionally, Alencar linked the possession of a nuclear bomb to higher international relevance, stating that a poor country like Pakistan had its voice heard in international affairs because of its nuclear arsenal. Once his observations were mass-produced, Brasília affirmed that Alencar had expressed his own personal views, which did not reflect Brazil’s official position.|$|E
25|$|Military {{facilities}} of the United States in Spain built {{during this}} era include Naval Station Rota and Morón Air Base, {{and an important}} facility existed at Torrejón de Ardoz. Torrejón passed under Spanish control in 1988. Rota has been in use since the 1950s. Crucial to Cold War strategy, the base did <b>have</b> <b>nuclear</b> weapons stationed on it for some time, and at its peak size, in the early 1980s, was home to 16,000 sailors and their families. The presence of these bases in Spain was resented by many Spaniards; there were occasional protests against them, including a demonstration during Reagan's 1985 visit to Spain.|$|E
25|$|However, {{during the}} 1947 Soviet Aviation Day display at Tushino Airport, a {{surprise}} appearance {{was put in}} by three Boeing B-29s, followed by a fourth four-engined long-range strategic bomber.
