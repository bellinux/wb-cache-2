The incidence of postoperative <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> <b>infection</b> is 0. 21 %- 3. 6 % {{in association with}} all vertebral surgical procedures. Surgery causes a variety of neuroendocrine and metabolic responses which generally results in immunosupression. Clinical results of immunosupression include delayed wound healing and septic complications. In this article, we report magnetic resonance imaging findings of a case with spondylodiscitis and spinal epidural abscess in which the imaging findings were apparent before the infection and inflammation related laboratory findings laboratory findings become positive. She {{has a history of}} surgery due to lumbar herniated disc a month. She was complaining of back and left leg pain. We performed contrast-enhanced MR imaging. MR imaging showed post operative changes at level L 5 and S 1. There was contrast enhancement {{at the level of the}} surgical gap in the posterior paravertebral muscles. MR imaging may help to differentiate postoperative spondylodiscitis and epidural abscess from early postoperative changes even before the laboratory tests appearing positive. In our case, surgery induced immunosupression may cause the infection and inflammation related laboratory findings being within normal limits at the beginning.

40|$|Intradural lumbar disc {{herniation}} {{is a rare}} pathological entity. The pathogenesis of intradural lumbar disc herniation is {{not known}} clearly. Intradural disc herniations usually occurred at the L 4 -L 5 levels but have also been reported at other levels. However, intradural disc herniation at L 5 -S 1 is quite rare. There are approximately nine reports in the English literature of intraradicular disc herniation at L 5 -S 1. We described a 61 -yr-old man with suspected intradural mass {{at the level of}} L 5 -S 1 space. The patient presented with pain in the lower back and both lower legs for 4 months and a sudden exacerbation of the symptoms for 3 days. Gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) demonstrated a large disc herniation at the L 5 -S 1 level with an intradural component. L 5 and S 1 laminectomy was performed, and dura was swollen and immobile. Subsequent durotomy was performed and an intradural disc fragment was removed. The patient had full recovery in 3 months. Intradural lumbar disc herniation must be considered in the differential diagnosis of mass lesions in the spinal canal.

40|$|We {{analysed}} 13 {{cases of}} lumbar disc infection following surgical discectomy. Two groups of patients were identified. Ths six patients of group A {{reported that the}} initial symptoms of discitis had appeared a mean of 15 days after surgery; on average, antibiotic treatment was started 31 days following operation and continued for 62 days, and symptoms regressed after 3. 9 months. Four patients showed moderate changes, while two had extensive osteolytic lesions of one or both vertebral bodies adjacent to the involved disc. In the 7 cases in group B, discitis was suspected a mean of 5 days and antibiotics were initiated a mean of 8 days following surgery; on average, symptoms regressed 1. 8 months after operation. Only four patients showed vertebral radiographic changes and none had marked destructive lesions. In both groups erythrocyte sedimentation rate exceeded 70 mm/h in cases in which discitis was suspected. Tomograms and magnetic resonance studies were the most diagnostic imaging studies {{in the initial stages}} of the disease. All patients obtained satisfactory clinical results at the last follow-up.

50|$|Other health {{conditions}} and disorders can cause hyperlordosis. Achondroplasia (a disorder where bones grow abnormally which {{can result in}} short stature as in dwarfism), Spondylolisthesis (a condition in which vertebrae slip forward) and osteoporosis (the most common bone disease in which bone density is lost resulting in bone weakness and increased likelihood of fracture) {{are some of the}} most common causes of hyperlordosis. Other causes include obesity, hyperkyphosis (spine curvature disorder in which the thoracic curvature is abnormally rounded), discitits (an inflammation of the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> caused by <b>infection)</b> and benign juvenile lordosis. Other factors may also include those with rare diseases, as is the case with Ehlers Danlos Syndrome (EDS), where hyper-extensive and usually unstable joints (e.g. joints that are problematically much more flexible, frequently to the point of partial or full dislocation) are quite common throughout the body. With such hyper-extensibility, it is also quite common (if not the norm) to find the muscles surrounding the joints to be a major source of compensation when such instability exists.|$|R

40|$|Study Design. Levels of the {{antibiotic}} cephazolin were measured in disc and blood from a consecutive series of patients undergoing lumbar spinal fusion. Objectives. To determine if levels of cephazolin {{in the human}} disc reach the stated minimum inhibitory concentration against Staphylococcus aureus (1 mg/L) following intravenous administration, and {{to determine if there}} is a therapeutic relationship between serum concentration and disc concentration. Summary of Background Data. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> <b>infection</b> is a potential complication of surgical procedures that violates the intervertebral disc. Bacteria, often from normal skin flora, can be introduced into the disc space causing inflammation with destruction of the adjacent vertebral endplate. Although there is substantial evidence from animal studies that prophylactic antibiotics reduce the incidence of discitis, similar evidence in human beings is not strong. Methods. A total of 30 patients, including 15 females and 15 males, with a mean age 42 years (range 21 – 63), received 1 -g cephazolin (intravenous) during 1 or 2 -level lumbar spinal fusion surgery. Venous blood was collected before administration of cephazolin and again at disc removal. Disc cephazolin concentrations were measured at the same time serum levels were measured for each patient. Results. The interval between cephazolin administration and tissue sampling ranged from 7 to 137 minutes. Cephazolin concentration in the serum (range 31. 1 – 148 mg/L) was higher than in the disc (range 0 – 9. 5 mg/L). The concentration of cephazolin peaked in the serum at 7 minutes, and in the disc between 37 and 53 minutes. More than 70 % of the disc samples had detectable levels of cephazolin at the time the disc was removed, although only half of these samples had cephazolin levels higher than 1 mg/L. All serum cephazolin concentrations were higher than 1 mg/L. Serum cephazolin concentration did not relate to disc concentration at a given time. Conclusions. The time when antibiotic concentration is highest in the disc varies among patients. More than 70 % of disc samples had detectable levels of cephazolin, although only half of the discs contained cephazolin higher than the stated minimum inhibitory concentration for S. aureus(> 1 mg/L).

50|$|Radiological {{intervention}} is often necessary {{to confirm the}} presence of vertebral osteomyelitis in the body. Plain-film radiological orders are necessary for all patients displaying symptoms of the disease. This diagnostic approach is often preliminary to other radiological procedures, such as magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, computed tomography (CT) scan, fine-needle aspiration biopsy, and nuclear scintigraphy. The initial plain-film X-ray images are scanned for any indication of disc compression between two vertebrae or the degeneration {{of one or more}} vertebrae. Only when these findings are ambiguous is further testing necessary to diagnose the disease. Other radiological approaches offer more comprehensive imaging of the spinal area, but can often prove inconclusive. MRI scans do not expose the patient to radiation and are highly sensitive to changes in the size and appearance of the intervertebral discs; however, findings on the MRI scan may be confused with other conditions such as the presence of tumors or bone fractures. If MRI imaging is inconclusive, the high sensitivity to erosions in the vertebrae or intervertebral discs of CT scans may be preferred for their ability to indicate signs of the disease more clearly than MRI. Additional tests may be ordered if such preliminary tests cannot confirm a diagnosis; for example, needle biopsies may be needed to take samples of bone surrounding the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> where the <b>infection</b> is thought to live, or nuclear bone scans may be used to contrast areas of healthy bone with areas of infection.|$|R
30|$|Extrusion is a {{herniated disc}} in which, {{in at least}} one plane, any one {{distance}} between the edges of the disc material beyond the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> is greater than the distance between the edges of the base of the disc material beyond the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> in the same plane or when no continuity exists between the disc material beyond the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and that within the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> [21]. Anatomically, the extrusion is the displacement of disc material with a full-thickness disruption of the annulus fibrosus fibres; usually the posterior longitudinal ligament however remains intact (Fig.  13). The posterior aspect of the extrusion may be larger than its base in the sagittal plane causing the posterior longitudinal ligament to tent, which often causes neurological symptoms and pain.|$|R

The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the {{relationship of}} the esophagus to the CVB, <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and LC. 30 patients were selected for a retrospective review of computed tomography (CT) scans. Measurements between the esophagus and the C 5, C 6, and C 7 vertebral bodies as well as the C 5 / 6 and C 6 / 7 <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were performed in the midline, 3  mm right and left of midline, and at the edge of the LC on both sides. The closest distance of the esophagus to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> occurs at the midline (range 1. 02 – 1. 31  mm at each level). The furthest distance occurred at the edge of the right LC (range 2. 67 – 3. 30  mm at each level). The mean distance from the edge of the right LC to the midline was significantly greater (P <  0. 01) than mean distance from the edge of the left LC to the midline. No statistical significant differences were observed when comparing measurements at the individual vertebral bodies and <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> The results of the study demonstrate that the esophagus lies in closest proximity to the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> in the midline. A larger potential space exists between the esophagus and the CVB and <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> at the edge of the LC.

40|$|STUDY DESIGN: Cross-sectional {{analysis}} of long-term follow-up (LTFU) data from 4 randomized controlled trials of operative versus nonoperative treatment for chronic low back pain. OBJECTIVE: To examine {{the influence of}} spinal fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height {{as an indicator of}} disc degeneration at LTFU. SUMMARY OF BACKGROUND DATA: There is ongoing debate as to whether adjacent segment disc degeneration results from the increased mechanical stress of fusion. METHODS: Plain standing lateral radiographs were obtained at LTFU (mean, 13 ± 4 yr postrandomization) in 229 of 464 (49 %) patients randomized to surgery and 140 of 303 (46 %), to nonoperative care. <b>Disc</b> <b>space</b> height and posteroanterior displacement were measured for each lumbar segment using a validated computer-assisted distortion compensated roentgen analysis technique. Values were reported in units of standard deviations above or below age and sex-adjusted normal values. Patient-rated outcomes included the Oswestry Disability Index and pain scales. RESULTS: Radiographs were usable in 355 of 369 (96 %) patients (259 fusion and 96 nonoperative treatment). Both treatment groups showed significantly lower values for <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the adjacent segment than norm values. There was a significant difference between treatment groups for the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height of the cranial adjacent segment (in both as-treated and intention-to-treat analyses). The mean treatment effect of fusion on adjacent segment <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was - 0. 44 SDs (95 % CI, - 0. 77 to - 0. 11; P = 0. 01; as-treated analysis); there was no group difference for posteroanterior displacement (0. 18 SDs, 95 % confidence interval, - 0. 28 to 0. 64, P = 0. 45).

40|$|Spondylosis deformans and diffuse {{idiopathic}} skeletal hyperostosis (DISH) {{are usually}} incidental ﬁndings {{and in most}} dogs are either asymptomatic or associated with mild clinical signs. Severe spondylosis defor- mans and DISH can result in complete bony fusion of consecutive vertebral segments. One of the recognised complications following vertebral fusion in human patients is the development of adjacent segment disease, which is deﬁned as degenerative changes, most commonly degenerative intervertebral disc disease, in the mobile vertebral segment neighboring a region of complete vertebral fusion. A similar syndrome following cervical fusion in dogs has been termed the domino effect. The purpose of this retrospective study was to investigate the hypothesis that vertebral fusion occurring secondary to spondylosis deformans or DISH in dogs would protect fused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> from undergoing degeneration, but result in adjacent segment disease at neighbouring unfused intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces.</b> Eight dogs with clinical signs of thora- columbar myelopathy, magnetic resonance imaging of the thoracolumbar vertebral column, and spondylosis deformans or DISH producing fusion of ≥ 2 consecutive intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were evaluated.

40|$|ABSTRACT Surgical {{treatment}} of intervertebral disc degeneration aims {{to restore the}} height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> and the release of involved neurological structures. Like any surgical treatment in orthopedics, {{the success or failure of}} the lumbar procedure involves the possibility of performing an adequate planning of each particular event. In the case of lumbar stabilization surgery with interbody fusion, it is essential to know the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> for the fusion to be successful. Objective: To demonstrate that the ideal height of the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds approximately to one third of {{the height of the}} vertebral body. Methods: X-ray images were taken in AP and lateral views of hospital residents to measure L 4 -L 5 vertebral bodies as well as the <b>disc</b> <b>space.</b> The rule of three was used to check the height of the disc and vertebral bodies. Results: It was verified that the <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> corresponds to 31 % of the size of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. Conclusions: The size of the disc corresponds to one third of the vertebral body, taking 0. 31 as the constant. The multiplication of the constant by the height of the vertebral body results in the exact height of the disc. Thus, in the presence of degeneration of the intervertebral disc, it is possible to know the size of the disc and, therefore, the size of the interbody cage...|$|R

A blind randomized crossover-design {{study was conducted}} to quantitatively compare the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> between axial and anterior lean cervical traction in sitting position. A total of 96 radiographic images from the baseline measurements, axial and anterior lean tractions in 32 asymptomatic subjects were digitized for further analysis. The intra- and inter-examiner reliabilities for measuring the intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> were in good ranges (ICCs = 0. 928 - 0. 942). With the application of anterior lean traction, the statistical increases were detected both in anterior and in posterior <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> compared to the baseline (0. 29 mm and 0. 24 mm; both P < 0. 01) and axial traction (0. 16 mm and 0. 35 mm; both P < 0. 01). The greater intervertebral <b>disc</b> <b>spaces</b> obtained during anterior lean traction might be associated with the more even distribution of traction forces over the anterior and posterior neck structures. The neck extension moment through mandible that generally occurred in the axial traction could be counteracted by the downward force of head weight during anterior lean traction.

Summary of Background Data. Anterior lumbar interbody fusion is an established treatment for lumbar disc degeneration. It Is not firmly established whether the grafted level narrows after surgery, and if so, what the clinical consequences are. Methods. This study assessed 67 patients who underwent anterior lumbar interbody fusion at L 4 -L 5 with autologous iliac crest graft. The <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height and angle between L 4 and L 5 were serially measured. Times until fusion {{and the presence of}} symptoms before and after surgery and at the latest follow-up assessment were noted. Results. The mean follow-up period was 14 years (range, 2. 5 - 32 years). The fusion rate was 96 % (64 of 67 patients), and the mean time to fusion was 9 months. In the group that had successful fusion, there was an initial increase in <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> distraction followed by a reduction in 55 patients (86 %). The mean preoperative <b>disc</b> <b>space</b> height was 12. 1 mm, which increased immediately after surgery to 16. 2 mm, but had been reduced to 12. 6 mm at the latest follow-up assessment. The reduction in distraction occurred within the first 3 months after surgery and was correlated with age, but not with recurrence of symptoms, the amount of initial distraction, or the gender of the individual. A similar trend was seen with L 4 -L 5 segmental angulation. Conclusions.
