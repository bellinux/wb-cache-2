5|$|An {{estimated}} 600 <b>grizzly</b> bears {{live in the}} Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem, {{with more}} than half of the population living within Yellowstone. The <b>grizzly</b> is currently listed as a threatened species, however the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has announced that they intend to take it off the endangered species list for the Yellowstone region but will likely keep it listed in areas where it has not yet recovered fully. Opponents of delisting the <b>grizzly</b> are concerned that states might once again allow hunting and that better conservation measures need to be implemented to ensure a sustainable population. Black bears are common in the park and were a park symbol due to visitor interaction with the bears starting in 1910. Feeding and close contact with bears has not been permitted since the 1960s to reduce their desire for human foods. Yellowstone is one of the few places in the United States where black bears can be seen coexisting with <b>grizzly</b> bears. Black bear observations occur most often in the park's northern ranges and in the Bechler area which is in the park's southwestern corner.|$|E

Critics heavily panned the film, feeling its plot, script, characters, and special effects were substandard.|$|E
