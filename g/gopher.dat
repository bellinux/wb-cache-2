5|$|Patterns {{of genetic}} {{variation}} in the camas pocket <b>gopher</b> have been studied. Although there are no subspecies, there is substantial genetic diversity within the species. Its genetic patterns are consistent with limited inbreeding within specific populations. This is similar to patterns described in Botta's pocket <b>gopher</b> and the southern pocket <b>gopher,</b> {{both of which are}} members of the same genus. However, it contrasts with patterns noted in Baird's pocket <b>gopher</b> and the plains pocket <b>gopher,</b> members of a separate genus, Geomys, which showed a higher degree of inbreeding.|$|E
5|$|There {{is little}} {{data on the}} {{longevity}} and mortality of the camas pocket <b>gopher.</b> It is presumably prey for carnivorous mammals, and its bones {{have been identified in}} regurgitated pellets of raptors such as the great horned owl. Parasites include mites, lice, fleas, roundworms and flatworms. The species' tougher skin may protect it from some fleas known to infest Botta's pocket <b>gopher</b> and the Mazama pocket <b>gopher.</b> Mites known to parasitize the camas pocket <b>gopher</b> include Androlaelaps geomys and Echinonyssus femuralis. Some authorities report Androlaelaps fahrenholzi as another parasitic mite, but a later publication did not report it. The chewing louse Geomydoecus oregonus has also been reported.|$|E

5000|$|Pocket <b>gophers,</b> {{commonly}} referred to as <b>gophers,</b> are burrowing rodents of the family Geomyidae. About 35 species of <b>gophers</b> live in Central and North America. [...] They are commonly known for their extensive tunneling activities. <b>Gophers</b> are endemic to North and Central America.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Gophers</b> {{then went}} on to win their second {{straight}} WCHA Championship with a 3-2 overtime win over Wisconsin.In the NCAA playoffs, the <b>Gophers</b> defeated the Providence Friars by a 6-1 score. With the win, the <b>Gophers</b> advanced to its fourth-straight NCAA Frozen Four appearance. The <b>Gophers</b> defeated the Dartmouth Big Green by a 7-2 score in the semifinal game. In the first period, the <b>Gophers</b> scored five goals in the first period. On March 27, the <b>Gophers</b> defeated the Harvard Crimson by a 4-3 mark to win their consecutive national championship.|$|R
50|$|The genus Geomys {{contains}} nine {{species of}} pocket <b>gophers</b> often collectively {{referred to as}} the eastern pocket <b>gophers.</b> Like all pocket <b>gophers,</b> members of this genus are fossorial herbivores.|$|R
5|$|Proposed {{methods for}} {{controlling}} <b>gopher</b> populations in agricultural areas include poisoning dandelions, clover, carrots, {{sweet potatoes and}} parsnips. Camas pocket gophers are larger than other gophers, so conventional <b>gopher</b> traps may fail to capture them. Toxic baits and fumigants may also fail, since the gophers will sometimes wall off {{a segment of the}} burrow. Gophers may also cause local flooding if their tunneling activities damage levees.|$|E
5|$|The camas pocket <b>gopher</b> is {{a mostly}} solitary {{herbivore}} which is active {{throughout the year}} and does not hibernate.|$|E
5|$|Camas pocket gophers cause {{significant}} economic losses, so may {{be treated as}} an agricultural pest. Crops damaged include clover, alfalfa and vetch. The gophers may eat these crops or damage the roots while burrowing. This can injure the roots and expose them to air, causing them to dry out. Subterranean activity can also damage the roots of fruit trees. Root crops are particularly susceptible to damage and consumption; potatoes, carrots, parsnips and other crops may be eaten on site or dragged off by the <b>gopher</b> for caching in the burrow. Excavated soil can cover grass and limit lifestock grazing; freshly sprouted grains may be similarly damaged. An estimate of impact from camas pocket <b>gopher</b> activities in the Willamette Valley in 1918 amounted to $1.5million annual losses. <b>Gopher</b> activities can provide a benefit of soil aeration, enhancing water retention after rain or snowmelt. Buried vegetation can also compost, enhancing organic soil content to provide additional benefits.|$|E
5000|$|The smooth-toothed pocket <b>gophers,</b> genus Thomomys, are {{so called}} {{because they are}} among the only pocket <b>gophers</b> without grooves on their incisors. [...] They are also called the western pocket <b>gophers</b> because they are {{distributed}} in western North America. They are considered distinct enough from other pocket <b>gophers</b> to be recognized as a separate subfamily or tribe.|$|R

5|$|The camas pocket <b>gopher</b> (Thomomys bulbivorus), {{also known}} as the camas rat or Willamette Valley <b>gopher,</b> is a rodent, the largest member in the genus Thomomys, of the family Geomyidae. First {{described}} in , it is endemic to the Willamette Valley of northwestern Oregon in the United States. The herbivorous <b>gopher</b> forages for vegetable and plant matter, which it collects in large, fur-lined, external cheek pouches. Surplus food is hoarded in an extensive system of underground tunnels. The dull-brown-to-lead-gray coat changes color and texture over the year. The mammal's characteristically large, protuberant incisors are well adapted for use in tunnel construction, particularly in the hard clay soils of the Willamette Valley. The gophers make chattering sounds with their teeth; males and females make purring (or crooning) sounds when they are together, and the young make twittering sounds. Born toothless, blind and hairless, the young grow rapidly before being weaned at about six weeks of age.|$|E
5|$|Disease. Increased {{disease in}} wild populations often follows {{weakening}} from other environmental stressors, such as habitat loss. Upper lung infection and shell diseases have {{been implicated in}} {{the decline of the}} desert tortoise (California, Nevada) and <b>gopher</b> tortoise (Georgia, Florida's state tortoise).|$|E
5|$|On March 23, 2007, Maturi made a {{move that}} {{surprised}} many when he hired Tubby Smith after he resigned from the University of Kentucky {{to be the next}} head <b>Gopher</b> basketball coach.

5|$|Four genera are {{represented}} with different {{species in the}} list. Terrapene (box turtles) has Terrapene ornata (Kansas) along with Terrapene carolina (Missouri, North Carolina, and Tennessee). Under Gopherus (<b>gopher</b> tortoises), there are Gopherus polyphemus (Georgia's state reptile and Florida's state tortoise) and Gopherus agassizii (California and Nevada). Under Crotalus (one of two rattlesnake genera), Arizona named Crotalus willardi willardi, while West Virginia chose Crotalus horridus. With Phrynosoma (horned lizards), Wyoming specified the entire genus, but Texas specified Phrynosoma cornutum.|$|E
5|$|Many {{habitats}} in {{the monument}} support populations of snakes and lizards. Southern alligator and western fence lizards are common; others that live here include short-horned and common side-blotched lizards and western skinks. Garter and <b>gopher</b> snakes and western yellow-bellied racers frequent floodplains and canyon bottoms. Rattlesnakes, though venomous, are shy and usually flee before being seen. The springs and seeps {{in the park}} contain isolated populations of western toads, American spadefoot toads, Pacific tree frogs, and long-toed salamanders.|$|E
5|$|Snakes {{such as the}} ringneck snake, western yellow-bellied racer, striped whipsnake, and Pacific <b>gopher</b> snake live in the oak savanna region. Birds such as the oak titmouse, ash-throated flycatcher, white-breasted nuthatch, western bluebird, violet-green swallow, acorn woodpecker, black-headed grosbeak, and American kestrel {{have also}} been found in this region. The rocks {{are known to be}} the northernmost place blue-gray gnatcatchers inhabit. Gall wasps live in this area, often {{creating}} galls in oak trees by injecting their larva into their leaves and branches.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} season, the <b>Gophers</b> ended a 10-year NCAA Tournament drought, {{along with}} capturing a WCHA Tournament Championship. Sonmor led the <b>Gophers</b> to the NCAA Championship game, beating Harvard 6-5 {{in the first}} round. The <b>Gophers</b> lost to Boston University in the Championship game, by a score of 4-2.|$|R

5000|$|The <b>Gophers</b> {{have had}} two head coaches to date: Laura Halldorson and Brad Frost. Halldorson was the head coach for eleven years, from the 1997-1998 season to the 2006-2007 season. Her overall {{coaching}} record was 278-67-22 with the <b>Gophers,</b> a winning percentage of [...]787. During that time, the <b>Gophers</b> won four of their five WCHA championships and three of their national championships. They averaged 28 wins per season and appeared in eight out of ten national tournaments, reaching seven finals. In addition, the <b>Gophers</b> experienced their best season in 2004-2005 with a 36-2-2 record.In the 2007-08 season, Brad Frost became the temporary head coach. He had previously been an assistant coach. In his first year as head coach, Frost led the <b>Gophers</b> to a 21-game winning streak, with the season's record ending with 27 wins, 7 losses, and 4 ties but also ended with a conference record of 21-5-2, which ranked second in the WCHA. The <b>Gophers</b> made another NCAA regional appearance and post-season Frost was awarded WCHA Coach of the Year. In the 2008-2009 season, his temporary coaching status was lifted and he was named permanent {{head coach of the}} <b>Gophers.</b> That same season he led the <b>Gophers</b> to a record of 32-5-3 and to another WCHA championship. Frost then coached the <b>Gophers</b> into back-to-back NCAA Frozen Four championships in 2012 & 2013, which were encompassed in their 62-game winning streak. The Golden <b>Gophers</b> have had a cross state rivalry with the Minnesota Duluth Bulldogs. The <b>Gophers</b> handed the Bulldogs their first ever conference loss 4-3 in a sold out game at Pioneer Hall on February 11, 2000.|$|R
5|$|The Texas pocket <b>gopher</b> avoids {{emerging}} {{onto the}} surface to feed by seizing the roots of plants with its jaws and pulling them downwards into its burrow. It also practices coprophagy. The African pouched rat forages on the surface, gathering anything that might be edible into its capacious cheek pouches until its face bulges out sideways. It then returns to its burrow to sort through the material it has gathered and eats the nutritious items.|$|E
5|$|The camas pocket <b>gopher</b> {{is found}} in the Willamette Valley and the {{drainage}} areas of the Yamhill River and other tributaries of the Willamette River. Its range extends north from Eugene to Portland and Forest Grove and west to Grand Ronde. A 1920 report of a Pleistocene fossil in Fort Rock, Oregon has been questioned, since it is far outside the species' current geographic range; as of 1987, the specimen could not be located for further evaluation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{predominant}} {{plant species}} in the alpine zone around the pass are the grass species adapted to the harsh climate. Other alpine flora, such as moss and lichens on the rocks, and wildflowers in season, make appearances. Shrubs that survive among them include strawberry, snowberry, willows and bog birch. Animals in the alpine zone include ptarmigans, small burrowing species like pika, marmots, and pocket <b>gopher,</b> and mountain goats.|$|E
50|$|The Golden <b>Gophers</b> {{ran into}} the buzz saw that was the 2006 Ohio State Buckeyes, and came away dominated. The <b>Gophers</b> gave up over two hundred more yards than they gained on the day offensively. The Golden <b>Gophers</b> were led offensively by Byran Cupito who passed for 120 yards on 13 completions. Minnesota's Deon Hightower {{recorded}} 13 tackles on the day. The <b>Gophers</b> were 4 of 14 on third down, while the Buckeyes were 7 of 10.|$|R
5|$|The Golden <b>Gophers</b> {{have had}} many {{successful}} players {{come through the}} program throughout its history. In {{the early years of}} basketball, when the <b>Gophers</b> had success, they recruited some of {{the best players in the}} country. George Tuck was a dominant center, and the first All-America for the <b>Gophers</b> in 1905. Frank Lawler was another early star: he led the Big Ten in scoring in 1911 and was also named to the All-America team, and helped the <b>Gophers</b> to a contested conference title.|$|R
50|$|The 1988 Minnesota Golden <b>Gophers</b> {{football}} team represented the University of Minnesota in the 1988 NCAA Division I-A football season. In their third year under head coach John Gutekunst, the Golden <b>Gophers</b> compiled a 2 - 7 - 2 record and were outscored by their opponents {{by a combined}} total of 246 to 195. The tie against Illinois was the last tie for the Golden <b>Gophers</b> and under current NCAA rules, {{it will be the}} last in Golden <b>Gophers</b> history.|$|R
