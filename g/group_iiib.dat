Patients and methodsFrom the SEER-database we retrieved gastric cancer patients with a primary adenocarcinoma, of Caucasian or Asian ethnicity and without distant metastases (M 0). The pTNM-stage was determined according to the 7 th edition of the union internationale contre le cancer (UICC) guidelines. ResultsSpanning the period 2004 – 2010, 6136 patients fulfilled all inclusion criteria including 3424 (55. 8 %) men, 2712 (44. 2 %) women, 4629 (75. 4 %) Caucasian and 1507 (24. 6 %) Asian patients. 1524 (24. 8 %) patients underwent total gastrectomy and 4612 (75. 2 %) non-total gastrectomy. Only in 41. 2 % of the patients were > 15 lymph nodes resected. 1857 (31. 0 %) patients received radiotherapy. Patient survival depended on ethnicity, type of surgery and radiotherapy. The discriminating value of the UICC-stage grouping could not be validated for Caucasian patients with > 15 lymph nodes resected and who had not received radiotherapy: stage <b>groups</b> IIB, IIIA, <b>IIIB</b> and IIIC showed substantial overlap in survival ranges. In addition, the tumour specific survival of the different T-/N-combinations was significantly different in stage <b>groups</b> <b>IIIB</b> and IIIC, respectively.

The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the curative effects of eliminating sedimentation inside the prostate via manipulation for the treatment of chronic pelvic pain syndrome (CPPS) using the National Institutes of Health (NIH) -chronic prostatitis symptom index (CPSI) scores. According to the prostatitis classification standard of the NIH, 721 patients with CPPS were divided into <b>groups</b> IIIA and <b>IIIB</b> by prostatic fluid routine examination (EPSRt) and treated using manipulation. The treatment was performed once per 3 days for 3 - 5 min and 10 treatments were considered to be a period. The EPSRt and NIH-CPSI scores were tested before and at the end of each period following treatment. After 3 treatment periods, the effectiveness and total effectiveness rates of the IIIA group were 72. 3 and 15. 9 %, respectively and those of the <b>IIIB</b> <b>group</b> were 71. 8 and 16. 3 %, respectively. Statistical analysis showed no significant differences between the curative effects in the two groups (P> 0. 05). The NIH-CPSI scores of the two groups were significantly improved following each treatment period (P< 0. 01).

30|$|The {{combined}} exposures {{that are}} subject to higher tier assessments also focus on the chemicals that drive the toxicity of the combined exposures. This is a novel concept [7, 8] not discussed in prior approaches for mixtures and combined exposures. This ability to focus is performed on a quantitative basis using the MCR. MCR values for exposures in <b>Group</b> <b>IIIB</b> give {{an indication of how}} many chemicals will drive the toxicity associated with the exposures. Values less than two indicate that only a few chemicals make important contributions to toxicity. When MCR values approach n (the number of chemicals that reach a receptor) all n chemicals will need to be investigated. In the example provided in Figure 4, the average value of MCR and n for <b>Group</b> <b>IIIB</b> exposures is 1.7 and 22 [9] indicating that toxicity is dominated by a few chemicals. In addition, it was shown that seven of the 89 chemicals analysed made significant contributions to ecotoxicity of the combined exposures of the mixtures. This finding can be confirmed by summing the HQ values of the components in order to cover a specific fraction of the total toxicity [25]. MoA data are only necessary for chemicals that drive toxicity, as the remaining chemicals can be conservatively assumed to follow additive models and not change the predicted HI values [26].|$|E

This study examined whether xenogeneic bone marrow stromal cells implanted immediately after myocardial infarction can survive and differentiate, attenuating deterioration in left ventricular function. MethodsIn groups I and II (n = 34), myocardial infarctions were created in immunocompetent adult Lewis rats by proximal left coronary artery ligation. In group I, 3 × 106 lacZ-labeled mouse bone marrow stromal cells were immediately injected into the peri-infarct area of the left ventricle, whereas in group II, only culture medium was injected. There were 10 early and 4 late deaths. At 4 weeks after injection, hearts were stained for β-galactosidase and troponin IC. In <b>groups</b> IIIA and <b>IIIB,</b> lacZ-labeled mouse skin fibroblasts were implanted into rat myocardium (n = 10 each) with and without left coronary artery ligation, respectively, and the rats were killed serially. In group IV, animals underwent sham surgery (n = 5, no deaths). At 4 weeks, surviving rats in groups I, II, and IV (n = 10, n = 10, and n = 5, respectively) underwent blinded transthoracic echocardiography for ventricular function studies. ResultsIn group I, labeled mouse-derived bone marrow stromal cells were found within rat myocardium that stained positively for troponin IC 4 weeks after implantation. Functionally, mean left ventricular ejection fraction (P =. 007), stroke volume (P =. 03), and fractional shortening (P =. 02) were all significantly higher in group I than in group II. In <b>groups</b> IIIA and <b>IIIB,</b> mouse fibroblasts induced cellular infiltration with rapid loss of donor cells. No labeled cells were found after 4 days.
