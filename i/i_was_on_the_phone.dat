It was subsequently released by Sire Records in the United States on 14 May and on CD in Europe and the United States on 24 August 1984. The album was marketed as [...] "the greatest album ever made" [...] and McCulloch later {{said it was}} because they believed it was. Although he also said it was meant as a joke when he said, [...] "That wasn't my idea! <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> to , just joshing and I said 'Oh, it's the greatest album ever made.'

2500|$|In September 2008, Matthew Bryza, {{the deputy}} {{assistant}} secretary of State, said the contents of the recorded phone conversations (which were presented as evidence of Russian invasion on 7 August) were consistent with what Georgians believed on August 7, in the final hours before the war, when a cease-fire collapsed. [...] "During the height of all of these developments, when <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with senior Georgian officials, they sure sounded completely convinced that Russian armored vehicles had entered the Roki Tunnel, and exited the Roki Tunnel, before and during the cease-fire," [...] he stated. [...] "I said, under instructions, that we urge you not to engage these Russians directly." [...] Bryza had also said earlier in August 2008, [...] "They felt they had to defend the honor of their nation and defend their villages. It was a very dangerous dynamic.

The LA police chief had to get up at a press conference and say: 'We have just arrested a suspect for the murder of Ennis Cosby going on information we are very confident about and this is in great part due to help from The National Enquirer.' <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> in a heartbeat to my editor to find out how we got them to say that.

5000|$|In {{an early}} March {{interview}} with Rap Radar, Rick Ross {{was asked if}} there were any plans of releasing a Maybach Music compilation album to introduce his new label-mates. Ross responded to the question stating:"I think we will bypass the compilation aspect but we’re gonna be releasing mixtapes. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> <b>phone</b> with DJ Drama last night discussing the possibility of a Maybach music, Gangsta Grillz. Like what we could do to make it different, you know. We had a good conversation."However, a few hours after the interview was posted to the internet, Rick Ross seemed to have a change of heart. He soon announced that he and Maybach Music Group will be releasing their first compilation album, Self Made, and will be distributed through his new deal with Warner Bros. Production of the album is handled by Cardiak, Just Blaze, Lex Luger, Lee Major, and many more. [...] On April 18 the official track listing was revealed.|$|E

The system was built from a modified HP 95LX palmtop computer and a Half-QWERTY one-handed keyboard. With the keyboard and display modules strapped to the operator's forearms, text could be entered by bringing the wrists together and typing. The same technology was used by IBM researchers to create the half-keyboard [...] "belt computer. Also in 1994, Mik Lamming and Mike Flynn at Xerox EuroPARC demonstrated the Forget-Me-Not, a wearable device that would record interactions with people and devices and store this information in a database for later query.

40|$|Major {{histocompatibility}} complex class I (MHC I) proteins provide protection from intracellular pathogens and cancer via each of a cell's MHC I molecules binding and presenting a peptide to cytotoxic T lymphocytes. MHC <b>I</b> genes <b>are</b> highly polymorphic and can have significant diversity, with polymorphisms predominantly localised in the peptide-binding groove {{where they can}} change peptide-binding specificity. However, polymorphic residues may also determine other functional properties, such as how dependent MHC <b>I</b> alleles <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peptide-loading complex for optimal acquisition of peptide cargo. We describe how differences in the peptide-binding properties of two MHC I alleles correlates with altered conformational flexibility in the peptide-empty state. We hypothesise that plasticity is an intrinsic property encoded by the protein sequence, and that co-ordinated movements of the membrane-proximal and membrane-distal domains collectively determines how dependent MHC <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> peptide-loading complex for efficient assembly with high affinity peptides...|$|R
