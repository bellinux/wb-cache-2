50|$|A tassel is {{primarily}} an ornament, {{and was at}} first the casual termination of a cord to prevent unraveling with a knot.

The tassel was its primary expression, but it also included fringes (applied, as opposed to integral), ornamental cords, <b>galloons,</b> pompons, rosettes, and gimps as other forms.

By the end of the 19 th century, the tradition of wearing peniks started to disappear due to the growing popularity of Myrtus head chains.

It was replaced by the so-called bright “EF-button” to be worn on the collar. The EF-button was fixed behind the nominal rank stars, and was removed on promotion to first officer grade.|$|E

50|$|It {{is worth}} {{mentioning}} that Gjakova {{was known in}} the whole region of Dukagjini Plain mostly {{for the development of}} pipe-makers craft, whilst the center for Kosovo was Pristina. This craft existed in these two centers until the late 1960s. Other craftsmen like clog (wooden sandal) makers, carpenters, and wood carvers from villages etc. used to deal with production of pipes, long pipes (chibouks, çubuks), and cigarette-boxes. In the past this craft was carried out also by silversmiths, who took care particularly of decoration of long pipes and weavers, who wove with silky <b>galloons</b> parts of the smoking set. The raw material used for the production of chibouks, long pipes, cigarette boxes and pipes was wood and horn, but in the past, ivory and bones were used. The terminology of this craft in Gjakova was in Albanian language, whilst in Pristina it was in Turkish language.|$|R

60|$|Such a personage {{was not to}} be {{received}} in deshabille. Her dignity and the dignity of the archbishop demanded that the gate should be served in full costume. For half an hour, therefore, had the princess to wait, in feverish impatience, until the two dignitaries of the porter's lodge arrayed themselves; and three o'clock sounded from the tower of Notre Dame before they came forth. They were in grand livery, of a buff color, with amaranth <b>galloons,</b> plaited with silver, and fringed sword-belts reaching to their knees, in which were suspended long rapiers. They had small three-cornered hats, surmounted with plumes; and each bore in his hand a halbert. Thus equipped at all points, they planted themselves before the door of the carriage; struck the ends of their halberts on the ground with emphasis; and stood waiting with official importance, but profound respect, to know the pleasure of the princess.|$|R
