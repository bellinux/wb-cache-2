She and her boyfriend Pat Jenkins (Lachlan Jeffrey) spend a few weeks together until she realises <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to work out, he leaves her. Her friends Jai Fernandez (Jordan Rodrigues) and Annie, who are in a relationship, make her feel lonely so she convinces herself she loves Miles. When her father Ross Buckton is diagnosed with Alzheimer's, she finds it hard to cope. She contacts - via the internet - classmate Matthew Lyons (Ross Pirelli), a wayward teenager, and reveals he is experiencing the same with his grandmother. When she finds out it is Matthew, she thinks he has lied and photographs him undressed and displays them. She then realises he was telling the truth, he would not forgive her and decides to exact revenge.|$|E

It {{is always going to be}} there. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> away. No way at all." [...] While basketball player Michael Jordan was Scott's childhood sports idol, he says Jordan was not the inspiration for his jersey number of 23. Scott chose it as a combination of his older brothers' high school numbers: James wore number 20, and Lee, Jr. wore number 3. Scott said, [...] "They were my father." ...|$|E
500|$|Writing for The A.V. Club, Sonia Saraiya {{felt that}} The Million Second Quiz, in {{contrast}} to other major reality shows such as Big Brother, was a [...] "hyped show about hype" [...] that was [...] "so deeply flawed and so universally unpopular that <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to remain in anyone's memory for long. ... In this wildly expensive failure, it’s possible {{to see so many}} of NBC's flaws, all in the same package." [...] However, she was pleased the show's production for featuring contestants who were [...] "friendly" [...] and [...] "relatable," [...] rather than [...] "chosen for their reprehensibility." [...] Digital Spys Catriona Wightman doubted the series would be able to retain viewership: [...] "Even while I sort of enjoyed the first episode despite myself, I can't imagine becoming obsessed with it to that extent - is there really enough there to sustain that kind of interest?" ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{peculiar}} attitude reserved {{only to the}} pelican, is the pelican in her piety. The Heraldic pelican, {{one of the few}} female beasts in heraldry, {{is shown}} with a sharp stork-like beak, which it uses to vuln ("pierce or wound") her own breast. This is per the Bestiary myth that a female pelican wounded herself thus to feed her chicks. This symbol of sacrifice carries a particular religious meaning (usually a reference to Christ's sacrifice), and became so popular in heraldry that pelicans rarely exist in heraldry in any other position. A distinction is sometimes observed, however, between a pelican [...] "vulning herself" [...] (alone, piercing her breast) and [...] "in her piety" [...] (surrounded by and feeding her chicks). The Pelican is shown exclusively in profile perched in her nest with her wings either Addorsed and Inverted (because <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to fly away) or Overt.|$|E

2500|$|The {{author of}} an article, {{the history of}} {{education}} spending in Pakistan since 1972, argues that this policy target raises a fundamental question: What extraordinary {{things are going to}} happen that would enable Pakistan to achieve within six years what it has been unable to lay a hand on in the past six decades? The policy document is blank on this question and does not discuss the assumptions that form the basis of this target. Calculations of the author show that during the past 37 years, the highest public expenditure on education was 2.80 percent of GDP in 1987-88. Public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP was actually reduced in 16 years and maintained in 5 years between 1972–73 and 2008-09. Thus, out of total 37 years since 1972, public expenditure on education as a percentage of GDP either decreased or remained stagnant for 21 years. The author argues if linear trend were maintained since 1972, Pakistan could have touched 4 percent of GDP well before 2015. However, it is unlikely to happen because the levels of spending have had remained significantly unpredictable and unsteady in the past. Given this disappointing trajectory, increasing public expenditure on education to 7 percent of GDP would be nothing less than a miracle but <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> to be of godly nature. Instead, {{it is going to be}} the one of political nature because it has to be [...] "invented" [...] by those who are at the helm of affairs. The author suggests that little success can be made unless Pakistan adopts an [...] "unconventional" [...] approach to education. That is to say, education sector should be treated as a special sector by immunizing budgetary allocations for it from fiscal stresses and political and economic instabilities. Allocations for education should not be affected by squeezed fiscal space or surge in military expenditure or debts. At the same time, there is a need to debate others options about how Pakistan can [...] "invent" [...] the miracle of raising education expenditure to 7 percent of GDP by 2015.|$|E
