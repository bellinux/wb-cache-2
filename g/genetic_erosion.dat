40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} may severely affect {{survival of}} social insect populations {{as the number}} of nests per population, not the number of individuals, represents population size, hence they may be particularly prone to loss of <b>genetic</b> diversity. <b>Erosion</b> of <b>genetic</b> diversity may be particularly significant among social Hymenoptera such as bumblebees (Bombus spp.), as this group may be susceptible to diploid male production, a suggested direct cost of inbreeding. Here, for the first time, we assess genetic diversity and population structuring of a threatened bumblebee species (Bombus sylvarum) which exists in highly fragmented habitat (rather than oceanic) islands. Effective population sizes, estimated from identified sisterhoods, were very low (range 21 - 72) suggesting that isolated populations will be vulnerable to loss of genetic variation through drift. Evidence of significant genetic structuring between populations (theta = 0. 084) was found, but evidence of a bottleneck was detected in only one population. Comparison across highly fragmented UK populations and a continental population (where this species is more widespread) revealed significant differences in allelic richness attributable to a high degree of genetic diversity in the continental population. While not directly related to population size, this is perhaps explained by the high degree of isolation between UK populations relative to continental populations. We suggest that populations now existing on isolated habitat islands were probably linked by stepping-stone populations prior to recent habitat loss...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAgricultural {{biological}} diversity (agrobiodiversity), {{is a small}} component of biodiversity, and presents two levels: genetic resources for food and agriculture and ecological services. All the components contribute to sustain the key functions of agro-ecosystems. It is commonly acknowledged that biodiversity is jeopardized by erosion, whereas there is less awareness about agrobiodiversity loss, although this has very negative short and long-term consequences for producers and consumers. In particular, important for conserving agrobiodiversity is the protection of landraces (LRs). The disappearance of LRs, also called by the farmers local or primitive varieties, means both <b>genetic</b> and cultural <b>erosion.</b> For this reason, in-situ LRs conservation is essential, {{as well as the}} ex situ one. The main objective of the present work is the evaluation of agrobiodiversity and of its role for the local community, by means of the Contingent Valuation.

40|$|The Mediterranean Basin {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{significantly}} altered World Biodiversity Hotspots with extensive habitat loss and fast <b>genetic</b> population <b>erosion,</b> for which urgent biodiversity reconnaissance and preservation actions are required. In particular, Sicily has about 600 taxa classified as threatened or near-threatened. The correct recognition and identification of such biodiversity is required for supporting further activities. The objective of this work is to assess the ability of the DNA barcoding approach to identify different taxonomic groups from a collection of the most threatened plant taxa, throughout natural Sicilian populations. The evaluation of the DNA barcoding core markers, rbcL and matK, was carried out on 30 taxa belonging to 13 families. DNA barcode fragments were recovered from all taxa (100 %). The rbcL gene was recovered from 97 % of the taxa and matK gene from 73 %. In this test, 19 taxa overall (63 %) were totally resolved at the specific or subspecific level, by at least one of the core markers. Fourteen of the 17 most threatened taxa (EN, CR) included in this work were totally discriminated. The matK and rbcL locus, respectively, resolved 64 % and 48 % of the taxa successfully sequenced. The matK gene expressed the highest genetic distance (K 2 P value), from 0. 4 % to 8. 6 %, against a range of 0. 1 – 2 % of rbcL gene. However, the rbcL gene appeared a good compromise between PCR, sequencing success and species-level resolution. Cryptic groups suggest the implementation of additional barcoding markers or different primer combinations, particularly for matK, in order to increase the performances. However, this preliminary result confirms the potential of the barcoding approach for quick identification of unknown and heterogeneous plant groups to generate a dedicated reference data-set of the threatened Sicilian flora for a wide range of applications...|$|R

40|$|Background: African {{wildlife}} {{experienced a}} reduction in population size and geographical distribution over the last millennium, particularly since the 19 th century {{as a result of}} human demographic expansion, wildlife overexploitation, habitat degradation and cattle-borne diseases. In many areas, ungulate populations are now largely confined within a network of loosely connected protected areas. These metapopulations face gene flow restriction and run the risk of <b>genetic</b> diversity <b>erosion.</b> In this context, we assessed the "genetic health" of free ranging southern African Cape buffalo populations (S. c. caffer) and investigated the origins of their current genetic structure. The analyses were based on 264 samples from 6 southern African countries that were genotyped for 14 autosomal and 3 Y-chromosomal microsatellites. Results: The analyses differentiated three significant genetic clusters, hereafter referred to as Northern (N), Central (C) and Southern (S) clusters. The results suggest that splitting of the N and C clusters occurred around 6000 to 8400 years ago. Both N and C clusters displayed high genetic diversity (mean allelic richness (Ar) of 7. 217, average genetic diversity over loci of 0. 594, mean private alleles (Pa) of 11), low differentiation, and an absence of an inbreeding depression signal (mean FIS = 0. 037). The third (S) cluster, a tiny population enclosed within a small isolated protected area, likely originated from a more recent isolation and experienced genetic drift (FIS = 0. 062, mean Ar = 6. 160, Pa = 2). This study also highlighted the impact of translocations between clusters on the genetic structure of several African buffalo populations. Lower differentiation estimates were observed between C and N sampling localities that experienced translocation over the last century. Conclusions: We showed that the current genetic structure of southern African Cape buffalo populations results from both ancient and recent processes. The splitting time of N and C clusters suggests that the current pattern results from human-induced factors and/or from the aridification process that occurred during the Holocene period. The more recent S cluster genetic drift probably results of processes that occurred over the last centuries (habitat fragmentation, diseases). Management practices of African buffalo populations should consider the micro-evolutionary changes highlighted in the present study. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Although a recent census indicated that there were 40 species and over 8000 breeds of domestic animals; {{for the purpose of}} conservation biology the diversity between and within breeds rather than species is regarded to be of crucial importance. This domestic animal genetic diversity has developed through three main evolutionary events, from speciation (about 3 [*]million years ago) through domestication (about 12000 [*]years ago) to specialised breeding (starting about 200 [*]years ago). These events and their impacts on global animal genetic resources have been well documented in the literature. The key importance of global domestic animal resources in terms of economic, scientific and cultural heritage has also been addressed. In spite of their importance, there is a growing number of reports on the alarming erosion of domestic animal <b>genetic</b> resources. This <b>erosion</b> of is happening in spite of several global conservation initiatives designed to mitigate it. Herein we discuss these conservation interventions and highlight their strengths and weaknesses. However, pivotal to the success of these conservation initiatives is the reliability of the genetic assignment of individual members to a target breed. Finally, we discuss the prospect of using improved breed identification methodologies to develop a reliable breed-specific molecular identification tool that is easily applicable to populations of livestock breeds in various ecosystems. These identification tools, when developed, will not only facilitate the regular monitoring of threatened or endangered breed populations, but also enhance the development of more efficient and sustainable livestock production systems...|$|R
40|$|Feral animals {{represent}} an important problem in many ecosystems due to interbreeding with wild conspecifics. Hybrid offspring from wild and domestic parents are often less adapted to local environment and ultimately, {{can reduce the}} fitness of the native population. This problem is an important concern in Norway, where each year, {{hundreds of thousands of}} farm Atlantic salmon escape from fish farms. Feral fish outnumber wild populations, leading to a possible loss of local adaptive <b>genetic</b> variation and <b>erosion</b> of <b>genetic</b> structure in wild populations. Studying the genetic factors underlying relative performance between wild and domesticated conspecific can help to better understand how domestication modifies the genetic background of populations, and how it may alter their ability to adapt to the natural environment. Here, based upon a large-scale release of wild, farm and wild x farm salmon crosses into a natural river system, a genome-wide quantitative trait locus (QTL) scan was performed on the offspring of 50 full-sib families, for traits related to fitness (length, weight, condition factor and survival). Six QTLs were detected as significant contributors to the phenotypic variation of the first three traits, explaining collectively between 9. 8 and 14. 8 % of the phenotypic variation. The seventh QTL had a significant contribution to the variation in survival, and is regarded as a key factor to understand the fitness variability observed among salmon in the river. Interestingly, strong allelic correlation within one of the QTL regions in farmed salmon might reflect a recent selective sweep due to artificial selection...|$|R
