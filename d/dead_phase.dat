40|$|Purpose: The paper {{presents}} {{numerical analysis}} results of stresses and displacement in femur {{in a living}} and a <b>dead</b> <b>phase.</b> The aim of the work was to present the influence of different mechanical properties of bone tissue on the obtained results. The appropriate selection of the properties ensures correct results, comparable with the results obtained in real conditions. Design/methodology/approach: The analysis was carried out on the femur of adult. The influence of the selected properties {{on the results of}} numerical analyses was analyzed. In order to carry out calculations, 3 models of diverse mechanical properties (Young modulus of bone in a living phase EI= 17260 MPa, Young modulus in order to carry out a comparison analysis EII. = 18600 MPa and Young modulus of bone in a <b>dead</b> <b>phase</b> EIII= 20202 MPa) were selected. Findings: The analyses showed the difference in displacements and reduced stresses depending on the selected mechanical properties. The analyses show that in order to select the appropriate stabilization method, mechanical characteristics of bone structures should be considered as viscoelastic. Quality of bone structures depends on individual features (genetic, hormonal, metabolic and circulatory factors). Research limitations/implications: The limitations were connected with simplification of numerical model of femur {{as well as with the}} selected boundary conditions. Practical implications: The obtained results can be useful in clinical practice. They can be applied in selection of stabilization methods or rehabilitation as well as in describing the biomechanical conditions connected with type of bone fracture obtained from medical imaging. Originality/value: Stress – displacement characteristics of femur for different degrees of demineralization, obtained from the numerical analyses were presented in the work...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In {{order to}} {{overcome}} the difficulties of online measurement of some crucial biochemical variables in fermentation processes, a new soft sensor modeling method is presented based on the Gaussian process regression and fuzzy C-mean clustering. With the consideration that the typical fermentation process can be distributed into 4 phases including lag phase, exponential growth phase, stable phase and <b>dead</b> <b>phase,</b> the training samples are classified into 4 subcategories by using fuzzy C-mean clustering algorithm. For each sub-category, the samples are trained using the Gaussian process regression and the corresponding soft-sensing sub-model is established respectively. For a new sample, the membership between this sample and sub-models are computed based on the Euclidean distance, and then the prediction output of soft sensor is obtained using the weighting sum. Taking the Lysine fermentation as example, the simulation and experiment are carried out and the corresponding {{results show that the}} presented method achieves better fitting and generalization ability than radial basis function neutral network and single Gaussian process regression model...|$|E

40|$|Based on {{numerical}} {{simulations of}} gas-rich galaxy mergers, we discuss {{a model in}} which quasar activity {{is tied to the}} self-regulated growth of supermassive black holes in galaxies. Nuclear inflow of gas attending a galaxy collision triggers a starburst and feeds black hole growth, but for most of the duration of the starburst, the black hole is heavily obscured by surrounding gas and dust which limits the visibility of the quasar, especially at optical and UV wavelengths. Eventually, feedback energy from accretion heats the gas and expels it in a powerful wind, leaving a 'dead quasar'. Between buried and <b>dead</b> <b>phases</b> there is a window during which the galaxy would be seen as a luminous quasar. Because the black hole mass, radiative output, and distribution of obscuring gas and dust all evolve strongly with time, the duration of this phase of observable quasar activity depends on both the waveband and imposed luminosity threshold. We determine the observed and intrinsic lifetimes as a function of luminosity and frequency, and calculate observable lifetimes ~ 10 Myr for bright quasars in the optical B-band, in good agreement with empirical estimates and much smaller than the black hole growth timescales ~ 100 Myr, naturally producing a substantial population of 'buried' quasars. However, observed and intrinsic energy outputs converge in the IR and hard X-ray bands as attenuation becomes weaker and chances of observation greatly increase. We obtain the distribution of column densities along sightlines in which the quasar is seen above a given luminosity, and find that our result agrees remarkably well with observed estimates of the column density distribution from the SDSS for appropriate luminosity thresholds.

40|$|International audienceWe {{present in}} this paper a new {{microwave}} sensor developed for autonomous vehicle navigation and perception in extensive outdoor environments. Radar offers advantages as a robotic perception modality, {{because it is not}} vulnerable to the functioning conditions found in natural outdoor environments: dust, rain, fog, snow, light conditions, wind turbulences, etc. The developed radar is based on Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) technology, that is well intended for short and medium-range applications. The paper describes the spatial integration that is used {{in order to reduce the}} speckle effect in radar image. This anti-speckle filtering is obtained through a <b>dead</b> reckoning <b>phase,</b> using two proprioceptive sensors (odometer and compass heading). The radar sensor is used to develop a Simultaneous Localization And Mapping (SLAM) application. In order to fit the needs of radar image analysis complexity, the SLAM process is purely radar based.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of non-linear mixed-signal systems like CP-PLLs is challenging because {{general theory of}} control systems cannot be applied easily. Therefore, CP-PLLs are designed within simulation platforms describing them on transistor-, behavioral-or linear-level. These models are often unprofitable according to the characterization capability, simulation time and computer resources when considering non-ideal effects. To avoid this, the modular and enhanced event-driven model can be used. Since this model is not applicable to combine phase noise and non-ideal effects, this paper focuses on modeling phase noise within the event-driven representation. Furthermore, an analytical description {{of the impact of}} <b>dead</b> zone on <b>phase</b> noise is given to obtain an optimized and robust system design...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} of gas transport in the lung occur within the detailed morphometry of the conducting airways. A computer {{model of the}} lung was developed based on the simultaneous convection-diffusion equation modified {{by the addition of}} a source term, which describes gas exchange between alveolar gas and blood, and a net alveolar flux boundary condition at the terminal lung generation, which allows for the evolution or uptake of the respiratory gases at the alveolar membrane in balance with body metabolism. The model was able to generate CO 2, O 2, and infused inert gas expirograms in a variety of morphometric models, including Weibel 2 ̆ 7 s model A, the model of Hansen and Ampaya, and models taken from Haefeli-Bleurer and Weibel. The model was used to study the effect of varying respiratory and morphologic parameters on <b>dead</b> space and <b>phase</b> III slope of the washout curve. Experimental data of expired tidal O 2, CO 2, He, and SF 6 during the continuous intravenous infusion of saline saturated with a mixture of the latter two gases in normal volunteers was obtained. The numerical model was able to generate expirograms with the same general shape as that obtained experimentally. Calculated phase III alveolar slope and dead spaces were significantly effected by airway geometry. In general, more rapidly flaring airways resulted in flatter slopes of phase III and smaller dead space fractions. Cardiac output had almost no effect on the calculated <b>dead</b> space. The <b>phase</b> III slopes and calculated dead spaces were inversely related to the gas diffusion coefficient. The model was able to show that the slope of the alveolar plateau of the CO 2 expirogram reflects persistence of concentration differences between inhaled gas and residual gas within the FRC and is exquisitely sensitive to changes which alter diffusive mixing in the distal airways. ...|$|R

5000|$|The {{games are}} split into several missions, {{which are usually}} sub-divided into <b>phases.</b> <b>Dead</b> {{soldiers}} are replaced by new ones {{at the start of}} each phase. Each soldier that survives a mission is promoted and receives a small increase in the rate of fire, accuracy, and range. The player is only able to save the game upon completion of a whole mission. Each phase is structured around mission objectives which range from [...] "Kill all enemies" [...] or [...] "Destroy enemy buildings" [...] to [...] "Rescue all hostages". Some phases are complex, and require the player to use their imagination, pre-planning and strategy. For example, players may have to split their team into two or more groups and leave one group to defend an area or route, assigning its control to the game's artificial intelligence, while taking control of another group.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} a bottom-up framework, {{based on the}} identification of appropriate order parameters and determination of phase diagrams, for understanding progressively refined agent-based models and simulations of financial markets. We illustrate this framework by starting with a deterministic toy model, whereby $N$ independent traders buy and sell $M$ stocks through an order book {{that acts as a}} clearing house. The price of a stock increases whenever it is bought and decreases whenever it is sold. Price changes are updated by the order book before the next transaction takes place. In this deterministic model, all traders based their buy decisions on a call utility function, and all their sell decisions on a put utility function. We then make the agent-based model more realistic, by either having a fraction $f_b$ of traders buy a random stock on offer, or a fraction $f_s$ of traders sell a random stock in their portfolio. Based on our simulations, we find {{that it is possible to}} identify useful order parameters from the steady-state price distributions of all three models. Using these order parameters as a guide, we find three phases: (i) the dead market; (ii) the boom market; and (iii) the jammed market in the the phase diagram of the deterministic model. Comparing the phase diagrams of the stochastic models against that of the deterministic model, we realize that the primary effect of stochasticity is to eliminate the <b>dead</b> market <b>phase.</b> ...|$|R
2500|$|Left 4 <b>Dead</b> {{underwent}} many <b>phases</b> of development; {{influenced by}} playtesting, Turtle Rock Studios removed {{many of the}} features that were originally in the game. In the initial phases, there was another special infected, called the [...] "screamer", which had no attacks but upon spotting a survivor would run to a safe place and then emit a loud scream that attracted a horde of infected. This infected class was removed, but its ability to attract the horde was incorporated into the boomer's vomit. A persistent merit/demerit system was envisioned to provide positive feedback for good behavior, such as aiding a fallen teammate; and negative feedback for poor behavior, such as shooting a teammate. This would provide a score to rank a player's effectiveness as a teammate, but this system was removed late {{in the development of}} the game in favor of immediate, non-persistent feedback displayed in-game. Another significant element removed was a long introduction between campaigns; because the game is designed for replayability, it was difficult to hold the player's attention for repeated viewings of cut scenes, so they were dropped in favor of a sparse narrative. Also, the game started out with one big city design with many routes for the survivors, but playtesters were confused when they began to play, and later they always chose the same route; ultimately Turtle Rock Studios cut the city maps into the first [...] "No Mercy" [...] and [...] "Dead Air" [...] campaigns.|$|R
3000|$|Due to the {{difficulties}} in assessing disturbance interactions relative to the two disturbances occurring independently, most studies have inferred interactions based on comparisons of fire severity following bark beetle mortality relative to fire severity without bark beetles present. These previous studies have provided insights {{into some of the}} controlling factors on fire behavior in bark beetle-impacted fuels, foremost of which is the temporal phase of the outbreak. Many studies have categorized the time between the occurrence of the bark beetle outbreak and a wildland fire into distinct temporal phases that represent the major changes in the forest fuel complex following the outbreak (e.g., Hicke et al. 2012). The temporal sequence of interest in this paper begins with the green phase (unattacked), and progresses through red (red needles remain on dead trees), and then to the gray <b>phase</b> (<b>dead</b> needles have fallen to the ground). Previous studies have suggested that bark beetle-caused mortality influences the canopy fuel moisture in the red phase and canopy fuel continuity in the gray phase thus affecting the severity of a subsequent fire. Theoretical frameworks and some studies predict higher fire severity in the red phase and lower in the gray phase (Jenkins et al. 2008, Hicke et al. 2012, Prichard and Kennedy 2014, Meigs et al. 2016). However, other studies have suggested that fires during the gray phase may be more severe than fires in green-phase forests, or they may be less severe or have little effect on fire severity in either phase (Hoffman 2011; Simard et al. 2011; Donato et al. 2013; Harvey et al. 2014 [...]...|$|R
40|$|Quadrupole Mass Spectrometry (QMS) {{has been}} used to {{validate}} the condition of the operating gas in a SF 6 GIS 150 kV indoor power substation, running under periodic maintenance for almost 30 years. The switches of the examined system were of the <b>dead</b> tank, single <b>phase,</b> double pressure type. The employed analyzer head enabled detection of positive ions having maximum mass to charge ratio 200 and a minimum detectable concentration 0. 5 ppm. According to the experimental results, before the periodic maintenance process the 34 S concentration had been increased by a factor of 2 (natural abundance of isotope 34 S is 4. 5 %). Additionally significant amounts of CO 2 could be detected in gas volumes enclosing the current transformers. One month after the periodic maintenance process, i. e. gas dehydration, chamber cleaning and filter substitution, the S isotopic ratios were back to normal and the CO 2 concentration was not detectable. In the event of permanent damage of solid insulants (i. e. presence of aluminum fluorides diffused in the epoxy resin) CO 2 concentration was still increased at higher concentrations than the CO 2 in atmosphere while the dew point measurements did not reveal the weakness. Other SF 6 by-products and their concentrations could also be detected with the above measuring instrument (i. e. SF 5 +, SF 4 +, SF 3 +, SF 2 +, SF+, S+, F+, H 2 O+, HO+, SOFx+, SO 2 Fx+) and therefore it may be used as a quality control tool of GIS power plants...|$|R
40|$|A {{dominant}} feature of folding of cytochrome c {{is the presence}} of nonnative His-heme kinetic traps, which either pre-exist in the unfolded protein or are formed soon after initiation of folding. The kinetically trapped species can constitute the majority of folding species, and their breakdown limits the rate of folding to the native state. A temperature jump (T-jump) relaxation technique has been used to compare the unfolding/folding kinetics of yeast iso- 2 cytochrome c and a genetically engineered double mutant that lacks His-heme kinetic traps, H 33 N,H 39 K iso- 2. The results show that the thermodynamic properties of the transition states are very similar. A single relaxation time tau(obs) is observed for both proteins by absorbance changes at 287 nm, a measure of solvent exclusion from aromatic residues. At temperatures near Tm, the midpoint of the thermal unfolding transitions, tau(obs) is four to eight times faster for H 33 N,H 39 K iso- 2 (tau(obs) approximately 4 - 10 ms) than for iso- 2 (tau(obs) approximately 20 - 30 ms). T-jumps show that there are no kinetically unresolved (tau < 1 - 3 micros T-jump <b>dead</b> time) "burst" <b>phases</b> for either protein. Using a two-state model, the folding (k(f)) and unfolding (k(u)) rate constants and the thermodynamic activation parameters standard deltaGf, standard deltaGu, standard deltaHf, standard deltaHu, standard deltaSf, standard deltaSu are evaluated by fitting the data to a function describing the temperature dependence of the apparent rate constant k(obs) (= tau(obs) (- 1)) = k(f) + k(u). The results show that there is a small activation enthalpy for folding, suggesting that the barrier to folding is largely entropic. In the "new view," a purely entropic kinetic barrier to folding is consistent with a smooth funnel folding landscape...|$|R
