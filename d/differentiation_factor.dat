5|$|All genes known {{so far to}} {{be linked}} to HHT code for {{proteins}} in the TGF-β signaling pathway. This is a group of proteins that participates in signal transduction of hormones of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily (the transforming growth factor beta, bone morphogenetic protein and growth <b>differentiation</b> <b>factor</b> classes), specifically BMP9/GDF2 and BMP10. The hormones do not enter the cell but link to receptors on the cell membrane; these then activate other proteins, eventually influencing cellular behavior {{in a number of ways}} such as cellular survival, proliferation (increasing in number) and differentiation (becoming more specialized). For the hormone signal to be adequately transduced, a combination of proteins is needed: two each of two types of serine/threonine-specific kinase type membrane receptors and endoglin. When bound to the hormone, the type II receptor proteins phosphorylate (transfer phosphate) onto type I receptor proteins (of which Alk-1 is one), which in turn phosphorylate a complex of SMAD proteins (chiefly SMAD1, SMAD5 and SMAD8). These bind to SMAD4 and migrate to the cell nucleus where they act as transcription factors and participate in the transcription of particular genes. In addition to the SMAD pathway, the membrane receptors also act on the MAPK pathway, which has additional actions on the behavior of cells. Both Alk-1 and endoglin are expressed predominantly in endothelium, perhaps explaining why HHT-causing mutations in these proteins lead predominantly to blood vessel problems. Both ENG and ACVRL1 mutations lead predominantly to underproduction of the related proteins, rather than misfunctioning of the proteins.|$|E

25|$|Cell {{adhesion}} molecules (CAMs) and neurotrophic factors embedded {{together into}} biocompatible matrices {{is a relatively}} new concept being investigated. CAMs of the immunoglobulin superfamily (IgSF), which includes L1/NgCAM and neurofascin, are particularly promising, because they are expressed in the developing nervous system on neurons or Schwann cells. They are known to serve as guidance cues and mediate neuronal differentiation. Neurotrophic factors such as NGF and growth <b>differentiation</b> <b>factor</b> 5 (GDF-5), however, are well established as promoters of regeneration in vivo. A recent study by Niere, Brown et al. investigated the synergistic effects of combining L1 and neurofascin with NGF and GDF-5 on DRG neurons in culture; this combination enhanced neurite outgrowth. Further enhancement was demonstrated by combining L1 and neurofascin into an artificial fusion protein, which improves efficiency since factors are not delivered individually. Not only can different cues be used, but they may even be fused into a single 'new' cue.|$|E

In the Czech Republic, housing {{is seen as the}} primary responsibility of the individual, but the state (region, municipality) is responsible for creating conditions, which enable individuals to fulfill their right to housing. The aim {{of this paper is to}} assess the <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> of housing and their changes in the Czech regions in the ten year period, between 2001 and 2011. The <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> are divided into two groups based on size and technical equipment. Their correlation with regional gross domestic product per capita, regional variability and change in relative positions of the sum of the standardized indicator values of the Czech regions are evaluated. It was found that regional <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> of housing do not correlate with the formation of wealth significantly; variability of indicators of housing in the Czech regions decreases over time; while the relative position in most regions in this direction is changing...|$|R
500|$|While at the NINDS, Fischbach {{researched}} {{the effects of}} neuregulin, which is a family of proteins including heregulin, neu <b>differentiation</b> <b>factor,</b> ARIA, and glial growth factor that are critical for vertebrate embryogenesis and specifically {{for the formation of}} vertebrate spinal cord oligodendrocytes. [...] Fischbach and his colleagues noticed that oligodendrocytes failed to form in mice that were homozygous for the mutant neuregulin gene. [...] However, when wild-type neuregulin was added to homozygous mutant neuregulin explants (isolated tissue cell cultures) nine days after conception of the embryos, normal oligodendrocyte development occurred. This indicated that neuregulin is not necessary for the proliferation of oligodendrocyte multipotent precursor cells. [...] Additionally, when IgB4, a neuregulin inhibitor, is added to wild-type explants, oligodendrocyte development failed to occur.|$|E

40|$|Tissue {{engineering}} of vascularized constructs {{has great}} utility in reconstructive surgery. While {{we have been}} successful in generating vascularized granulation-like tissue and adipose tissue in an in vivo tissue engineering chamber, production of other differentiated tissues in a stable construct remains a challenge. One approach is to utilize potent <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors,</b> which can influence the base tissue. Endothelial precursor cells (EPCs) have the ability to both carry <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> and home to developing vasculature. In this study, proof-of-principle experiments demonstrate that such cells can be recruited from the circulation into an in vivo tissue engineering chamber. CXC chemokine ligand 12 (CXCL 12) /stromal cell-derived factor 1 was infused into the chamber through Alzet osmotic pumps and chamber cannulation between days 0 and 7, and facilitated recruitment of systemically inoculated exogenous human EPCs injected on day 6. CXCL 12 infusion resulted in an eightfold increase in EPC recruitment, 2 (p = 0. 03) and 7 days postinfusion (p = 0. 008). Delivery of chemotactic/proliferation and/or <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> and appropriately timed introduction of effective cells may allow us to better exploit the regenerative potential of the established chamber construct. © Copyright 2009, Mary Ann Liebert, Inc. 2009...|$|R

40|$|Intermittent Claudication [1] is {{a walking}} symptom. After {{a short time}} walking, {{patients}} suffer from pains at lower limbs. But if taking a rest, the pains can be relieved and they can walk again. Unfortunately, it arises from not one but mainly two kinds of diseases: LSS (lumber spinal canal stenosis) and PAD (peripheral arterial disease). Additionally, it is reported that symptom is similar and LSS groups is furthermore divided into two main groups: L 4 and L 5 groups.

40|$|We {{have studied}} the {{stability}} of the dopaminergic phenotype in a conditionally immortalized human mesencephalic cell line, NIESC 2. 10. Even though MESC 2. 10 cells exhibit features of dopaminergic neurons in vitro, none of the cells expressed tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) after transplantation into a rat model of Parkinson's disease. We examined whether this is caused by cell death or loss of transmitter phenotype. Cells were cultured in differentiation medium, then harvested and replated into the same medium where they continued to express TH, whereas replated cells fed medium lacking <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> (dibutyryl cAMP and glial cell line-derived neurotrophic factor) did not. Interestingly, cultures grown in the absence of <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> could regain TH expression once exposed to differentiation medium. Our data suggest that TH expression in vitro is inducible in neurons derived from the NIESC 2. 10 cell line and that the dopaminergic phenotype of these cells in vivo might be unstable.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{differentiate}} central blood system mononucleated cells in vitro into osteoblast and osteoclast cells for three different proliferation terms of cells. The mononucleated cells were cultured in a selective proliferation medium for three different proliferation terms, i. e., short (5 days), medium (15 days) and long term (30 days) prior to analysis of osteoblast and osteoclast cells’ differentiation potentialities. The proliferation medium was then supplemented with <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors,</b> i. e., ascorbic acid and β-glycerophosphate to differentiate mononucleated cells into osteoblast cells. For osteoclast assay, RANKL and M-CSF were added into proliferation medium. For control, the same cells were used without supplementation of respective <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors.</b> The viability of differentiated cells from short, medium and long types of cells showed that they were able to survive until 10 to 14 days in the presence of respective <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> without significant increased in the specific differentiation medium. Biochemical analyses on both alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and tartrate resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP) activities were significantly increased (p< 0. 05) once cultured in their respective differentiation medium. In conclusion, the three types of primitive cells have the same potentiality to differentiate into mature osteoblast and osteoclast cells even though the proliferation rates are different, i. e. 0. 37, 0. 55 and 0. 72 division/day for short, medium and long term cells respectively.

40|$|Antioxidants possess {{significant}} therapeutic {{potential for}} the treatment of inflammatory disorders. One such disorder is periodontitis characterised by an antimicrobial immune response, inflammation, and irreversible changes to the supporting structures of the teeth. Recognition of conserved pathogen-associated molecular patterns is a crucial component of innate immunity to Gram-negative bacteria such as Escherichia coli, as well as the periodontal pathogen Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans. In this study, we investigated the antioxidants Phloretin, Silymarin, Hesperetin, and Resveratrol to ascertain whether they altered the production of inflammatory mediators by innately-activated leukocytes. Peripheral blood mononuclear cells were stimulated with lipopolysaccharide purified from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans, and the production of cytokines, chemokines, and <b>differentiation</b> <b>factors</b> was assayed by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, cytometric bead array, and RT-PCR.
