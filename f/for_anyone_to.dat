5|$|In {{response}} to Jayaprakash Narayan's {{call for a}} Total Revolution, Reddy emerged from his political exile in 1975. In January 1977, he was made {{a member of the}} Committee of the Janata Party and in March, he fought the General Election from the Nandyal constituency in Andhra Pradesh as a Janata Party candidate. He was the only non-Congress candidate to be elected from Andhra Pradesh. The Congress Party led by Prime Minister Indira Gandhi was defeated, ending 30 years of Congress rule in India and a five party coalition with Morarji Desai as its leader came to power. Reddy was unanimously elected Speaker of the Sixth Lok Sabha on 26 March 1977. However he resigned a few months later to contest in the presidential elections of July 1977. Reddy's second term as Speaker lasted three months and 17 days and remains till date the shortest tenure <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> have held that post.|$|E

25|$|When {{it became}} clear that the Battle of France was lost, time was limited <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> evacuate, even so 25,000 people went to England, roughly 17,000 from Guernsey, 6,000 from Jersey and 2,000 from Alderney in the ten days before the German troops landed at the end of June 1940. Most civilians who were {{evacuated}} went to England.|$|E

25|$|After his {{identity}} was publicly exposed {{and he was}} forced to relocate to San Francisco, Matt Murdock's secret identity as Daredevil was restored by the Purple Children, the children of his old foe the Purple Man.

25|$|Applying these {{rationales}} to the Board's case, the Court {{determined that}} the program, previously found unconstitutional in Aguilar, was neither aiding nor inhibiting religion in an impermissible fashion. Reasoning that the aid was distributed according to secular criteria, and offered to all eligible students regardless of school choice, the system of distributing aid was neutral with respect to religion. The program as enacted by the Board did not give any incentive <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> alter their religious views.|$|E
25|$|It {{became clear}} that a better-defined unit was needed. Jules Violle had {{proposed}} a standard based on the light emitted by 1cm2 of platinum at its melting point (or freezing point), calling this the Violle.

This made it easy <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> measure the standard, as high-purity platinum was widely available and easily prepared.|$|E

He tried to intervene on a celebration dance off by Brian Christopher and Ernest Miller.|$|E

25|$|Before 1400 it {{was rare}} <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> be persecuted for witchcraft, but the {{increasingly}} common persecution of heresy {{and failure to}} fully defeat those heretics {{paved the way for}} later criminal prosecution of witchcraft. By the 15th century belief in witches was widely accepted in European society. Previously, those convicted of witchcraft typically suffered penalties no more harsh than public penances such as a day in the stocks, but their persecution became more brutal following the publication of the Malleus Maleficarum, as witchcraft became widely accepted as a real and dangerous phenomenon. The most vigorous persecutions took place between years 1560 and 1630, ending in Europe around 1780.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, on February 4, 1992, the Latvian {{government}} {{created a}} cultural historic protected territory called Līvõd rānda - the Livonian Coast - which included all {{twelve of the}} Livonian villages: Lūžņa (Livonian: Lūž), Miķeļtornis (Pizā), Lielirbe (Īra), Jaunciems (Ūžkilā), Sīkrags (Sīkrõg), Mazirbe (Irē), Košrags (Kuoštrõg), Pitrags (Pitrõg), Saunags (Sǟnag), Vaide (Vaid), Kolka (Kūolka), and Melnsils (Mustānum). The Latvian government discourages settlement of ethnic Latvians and other non-Livonians {{in this area and}} prohibits alterations to historic village sites. Also, it is prohibited <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> start a hotel, restaurant, or other public establishment which might adversely influence the Livonian culture or draw outsiders into the area.|$|E
25|$|At first no {{suitable}} coffin for {{the body}} could be located. The muddy roads were too flooded <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> get {{in or out of}} the town of Lexington. An undertaker had ordered three from Richmond that had reached Lexington, but due to unprecedented flooding from long-continued heavy rains, the caskets were washed down the Maury River. Two neighborhood boys, C.G. Chittum and Robert E. Hillis, found one of the coffins that had been swept ashore. Undamaged, it was used for the General's body, though it was a bit short for him. As a result, Lee was buried without shoes. He was buried underneath Lee Chapel at Washington and Lee University, where his body remains.|$|E
25|$|Pei Songzhi cast doubts on the Shiyu account. He {{felt that}} it was {{unlikely}} that Yu Song had to recommend Zhong Hui to Sima Shi, because Sima would most probably have already at least heard of Zhong due to the following reasons. First, Zhong Hui came from an elite family background. Second, he was already famous when he was still a youth. Third, he started serving in the Wei government as soon as he reached the age of adulthood. Pei also believed that it was impossible <b>for</b> <b>anyone</b> <b>to</b> be able to tell, simply by reading a piece of writing, that a person who edited a few words in it is capable of shouldering greater responsibilities.|$|E
