40|$|Abstract-The crystal {{structure}} of nacrite from Pike's Peak district, Colorado, has been refined by least squares and electron density difference maps utilizing ten levels of data. Complete refinement was inhibited by thick domains involving a/ 3 interlayer {{shifts in the}} "wrong direction". The ideal structure {{is based on a}} 6 R stacking sequence of kaolin layers, in which each successive layer is shifted relative to the layer below by [...] ~ of the 8. 9 A. lateral repeat. This direction is X in nacrite, contrary to the usual convention for layer silicates, because of the positioning of the (010) symmetry planes normal to the 5. 1, ~ repeat <b>direction.</b> <b>Alternate</b> layers are also rotated by 180 ~ The pattern of vacant octahedral sites reduces the symmetry to Cc and permits description of the structure as a 2 -layer form with an inclined Z axis. Adjacent etrahedra re twisted by 7 - 3 ~ in opposite directions o that the basal oxygens approach more closely both the AI cations in the same layer and the surface hydroxyls of the layer below. Interlocking corrugations in the oxygen and hydroxyl surfaces of adjacent layers run alternately parallel to the [I 10] and [170] zones in successive layers. The upper and lower anion triads in each Al-octahedron are rotated by 5. 4 ~ and 7 - 0 ~ in opposite directions as a result of shared edge shortening. Nacrite has a greater interlayer separation and smaller lateral dimensions than dickite and kaolinite, and the observed/ 3 angle deviates by 189 ~ from the ideal value. These features, as well as its overall lesser stability, are believed due to the less favorable positioning in nacrite of the basal oxygens relative to the directed interlayer hydrogen bonds...|$|E

40|$|The {{results of}} the already {{published}} three reports and this paper are summarized as follows (ref. the summarized table) : 1. The 48 groups of lymph nodes were distinguished by their positions in the cat. Out of them, 9 groups : Lnn. subinguinales profundi, Lnn. epigastrici craniales, Ln. femoralis lateralis, Ln. prefemoralis, Lnn. intestinales, Lnn. sacrales laterales, Ln. mediastinalis ventralis, Lnn. mediastinales dorsales and Ln. diaphragmaticus, as lymph nodes in the cat, are herein described {{for the first time}} on the basis of the writers' observations. Furthermore, in 13 groups (^* mark) some revisions have become necessary in detailed descriptions. 2. Each group of lymph nodes was placed in either the constant (100 %), nearly constant (less than 100 %, over 80 %) or inconstant (less than 80 %) group determined by that occurrence ratio. The inconstant group, it showed a specific feature in that it consists of small nodes, generally less than 6 mm in the longest diameter. 3. In regard to the numbers of lymph nodes, some remarkable individual variations were noted in the abdominal cavity only, but not in other areas. No definite variations were found by sexes or between the right and left sides of the body. 4. The afferent and efferent lymphatic vessels of the above groups of lymph nodes have been described in the writers' series of reports. 5. In addition, three kinds of specific lymph streams were distinguished and discussed, as follows : 1) The branch lymph streams of the thoracic duct and jugular trunks were detected in some cases. Some branches of the thoracic duct passed through Lnn. mediastinales craniales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales dextri, as has already been stated in respect to the cat. The writers, furthermore, found for the first time some branches of the thoracic duct which passed through Lnn. mediastinales dorsales, Lnn. tracheobronchiales craniales sinistri, Lnn. tracheobronchiales caudales and Ln. infraclacicularis, and some branches of the jugular trunk which passed through Lnn. anguli brachiocephalici. In the thoracic duct of the cat, the network formation surrounded Aa. intercostales in all cases. 2) Some peripheral lymphatic vessels, originating from the trachea, esophagus, thyroid gland, thymus, diaphragm, costal pleura, testis and ovary, empty directly into the jugular trunk, thoracic duct, lumbar trunk or cisterna chyli without the lymph passing through a node and then pour into the venous angles. The appearance of such lymphatic vessels is related intimately with the degree of occurrence of the special fixed nodes in accordance with the peripheral areas of their origin. It was suggested that such lymphatic vessels maintain an undifferentiated state without developing any appropriate node. 3) The writers found lymphatic communications by which lymph streams reversely among lymph nodes. The communications are divided into three types as follows : type A-connection by which lymph is able to stream reversely through a valveless-like vessel; type B-connection whose lymphatic vessels with single flowing <b>direction</b> <b>alternate</b> with each other among nodes; type C-connection by lymphatic networks with valves at various places. To the matter of this finding, no attention has been paid particularly until now. The occurrences of such communications are more numerous in the body surface than those in the thoracic and abdominal cavities. From the obtained results and from consideration of the development of the lymphatics, it seems that such communications derive from a remainder of a lymphatic plexus which appeared in the course of the developmental process. The third type is C, an original form, which may be changed from type B to type A, a more advanced one. A lymph stream by way of such communications among nodes may flow from the periphery towards the body center in the normal living state. But if the tissue pressure in the peripheral areas is made higher by some conditions, such flow can clearly be reversed. The three kinds of specific lymph vessels should be noted in pathology and physiology to act as a specific pathway of the lymph. 6. The writers divided lymph nodes into three types of Z, T and ZT, and made macroscopic observations with considerations of the structural differences among the nodes of each type. The node of type Z receives only peripheral lymph, that of type T receives only lymph which has passed through other nodes and that of type ZT receives both sorts of lymph. The occurrences of each type differed among the groups of lymph nodes which were determined by their locations. As a rule, no definite differences were macroscopically detected between types Z and ZT, but only type T showed a specific feature; type T is small node, approximately 1 mm in diameter, which does not join into groups at a definite position but appears as an accessory one accompanying types Z and ZT without exception. 7. From the ratio of occurrences, types classified by appearances of afferent vessels and sizes of lymph nodes, the writers suggest, at least, that there is something of structural difference among nodes of 3 groups as follows : 1. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' constant and nearly constant groups, 2. nodes of types Z and ZT in the writers' inconstant group, 3. nodes of type T, without falling into groups classified with relation to their ratio of occurrence. The suggestion should be followed up by microscopical observations. 8. In this observation, Neoprene latex was used in an attempt to find whether it was applicable for demonstration of lymphatic vessels. Neoprene latex is within the range of possibility of use as an injection material for comparatively larger vessels, but more advanced study is necessary before it can be recommended for injection into the peripheral lymphatic vessels...|$|E
40|$|In {{this thesis}} two {{unrelated}} topics of reactor physics are examined: the prompt jump approximation and <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> checkerboard methods. In the prompt jump approximation {{it is assumed}} that the prompt and delayed neutrons in a nuclear reactor may be described mathematically as being instantaneously in equilibrium with each other. This approximation is applied to the spatially dependent neutron diffusion theory reactor kinetics model. <b>Alternating</b> <b>direction</b> checkerboard methods are a family of finite difference <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> methods which may be used to solve the multigroup, multidimension, time-dependent neutron diffusion equations. The reactor mesh grid is not swept line by line or point by point as in implicit or explicit <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> methods; instead, the reactor mesh grid may {{be thought of as a}} checkerboard in which all the ''red squares'' and '' black squares'' are treated successively. Two members of this family of methods, the ADC and NSADC methods, are at least as good as other <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> methods. It has been found that the accuracy of implicit and explicit <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> methods can be greatly improved by the application of an exponential transformation. This transformation is incompatible with checkerboard methods. Therefore, a new formulation of the exponential transformation has been developed which is compatible with checkerboard methods and at least as good as the former transformation for other <b>alternating</b> <b>direction</b> methods.

The main disadvantage of the methods proposed in [12 – 17] is that solving equation (1.6) requires the solution of equation (1.5).
