5|$|Fire Brigade (set number 10197), {{released}} in September 2009, {{was the fourth}} set in the Modular Buildings series. The set contains 2231 pieces and is recommended for builders 16 {{years of age or}} older. Modeled to look like a realistic 1930s fire station, the set includes a bell tower, an opening <b>garage</b> <b>door,</b> a 1930s style fire truck, and 4 minifigures with a fire-dog. Like Green Grocer, all floors in the Fire Brigade set are fully furnished. The Fire Brigade is the first Modular House to come with a vehicle, the 1930s style fire truck. The set also includes some new, unique pieces, such as gold fire helmets and a red sliding <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E

He was reportedly crushed between his car and a <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{the school}} closed in 1953, the larger, {{original}} room was {{converted into a}} bus garage by the Chana School District. A large <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> was cut into {{the building and the}} floor completely removed. The smaller, 1893 room became a storage area. In 1962, the Chana School District ran out of room and used the building as an overflow classroom. By the mid-1960s, the Chana District folded and was absorbed by the Oregon School District. Residents were allowed to remove any items from the school after the district shut down.|$|E

50|$|Reinforcing <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> and {{entry doors}} is also common {{practice}} for hurricane preparing a home. <b>Garage</b> <b>doors</b> may {{be protected by}} fabric screens, made of a strong woven fabric, to keep out projectiles and to reinforce the door.|$|R
5|$|Located at 800 Southeast 10thAvenue, the {{building}} occupies the west {{half of the}} block between Southeast Belmont and Southeast Morrison streets. The southwest corner entry features a stylized Egyptian temple of cast stone. Italianate Renaissance influence {{is seen in the}} ground floor's large arched windows and tall narrow windows on the second. The west facade is lined with banks of large windows that helped illuminate and cool the work areas. Other important exterior features include a large <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> along Belmont Street, and a paved parking lot and water-tower pedestal on the Morrison Street side.|$|E
5|$|Billy is {{released}} the next day. Suspicion {{has shifted to}} Sidney's father, Neil Prescott, as the calls have been traced to his phone. School is suspended {{in the wake of}} the murders. After the students have left the school, Principal Himbry is stabbed to death in his office. Tatum's boyfriend, Stu Macher throws a party to celebrate the school's closure. The party is attended by Sidney, Tatum, their friend Randy Meeks, and multiple other students. Reporter Gale Weathers attends uninvited to cover the situation, as she expects the killer to strike. Tatum's brother deputy sheriff Dewey Riley also looks out for the murderer at the party. Tatum is killed during the party after having her head crushed by the <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b> Billy arrives to speak to Sidney privately, and the two ultimately consummate their relationship. Dewey and Gale investigate a nearby abandoned car. Many party attendees are drawn away after hearing news of Himbry's death; Sidney, Billy, Randy, Stu, and Gale's cameraman Kenny remain.|$|E
5|$|The Anderson Street Station had a wood {{siding with}} a {{shingled}} roof, two brick chimneys {{off the roof}} and two asphalt platforms in both directions. The station also had a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> on the southern side of the building. No official style of architecture was mentioned for Anderson Street in the 1920 Final Engineering Report {{due to lack of}} design. Nearby, a wooden watchman's shanty was constructed near the team track. The station had two tracks run through it (one main track and a team track) and had a rail crossing between tracks. By 1870, the tracks had been extended northward to Hillsdale, and public service began on the line on March 4 of that year. Trains terminated at Hillsdale with fare of only $0.75 (1870 USD), but just one year later, the extension northward. The service was extended northward to the community of Haverstraw, New York, and in 1896, the rail line was leased by the private company to the Erie Railroad.|$|E
5000|$|Garages: <b>Garage</b> <b>doors</b> are {{generally}} 7'-0" [...] or 8'-0" [...] wide for a single-car opening. Two car <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> (sometimes called double car doors) are a single door 16'-0". Because of {{size and weight}} these doors are usually sectional. That is split into four or five horizontal sections {{so that they can}} be raised more easily and don't require a lot of additional space above the door when opening and closing. There are single piece double <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> found in some older homes. circa 1950's ...|$|R
5000|$|Fiberglass and vinyl <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> are {{composite}} units, combining a {{steel core}} behind a fiberglass or vinyl skin. They have also polyurethane insulated base sections, or {{other type of}} foam insulation. These premium doors can match steel <b>garage</b> <b>doors,</b> and be a realistic imitation of wood (namely fiberglass units), {{but they may be}} more expensive than steel units.|$|R

25|$|A <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener is a {{motorized}} device that opens and closes a <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b> Most {{are controlled by}} switches on the garage wall, {{as well as by}} a remote control carried in the garage owner's vehicle. In 1926, the electric <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener was invented by C.G. Johnson, the inventor of the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> and founder of the Overhead Door Corporation.|$|E
25|$|Other, non-powertrain related {{upgrades}} {{made to the}} 2011 Mustang {{included a}} Nexteer Automotive Electric Power Steering (EPS) system with pull-drift compensation and active nibble control, general aerodynamic and NVH improvements over the 2010 Mustang, a digital message/information center, blind spot mirrors integrated into the car's side mirrors, a universal <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener, a 160mph speedometer, and Ford's MyKey programmable vehicle key technology.|$|E
25|$|Dual-way power sunroofs were {{available}} on this car. They were designed and installed by American Sunroof (now American Specialty Cars) from its Columbus, Ohio plant, not by Mopar itself. An installed sunroof eliminated {{most of the}} front overhead console that featured storage bins for a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener and sunglasses. However, the Overhead Travel Information System (OTIS), or on-board computer with integrated map lights, was retained.|$|E

25|$|When Ruetten {{returned}} {{home in the}} evening, he found his <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> open and broken glass on the driveway. In addition, Ruetten discovered that the BMW he had bought for Rasmussen as an engagement gift was missing. Because of her morning plans, he found it strange that Rasmussen would have later gone out without letting him know. The house's answering machine had not been activated, despite both of them usually activating it when leaving the house unoccupied.|$|E
25|$|Early US-specification Range Rover {{included}} {{air conditioning}} with tri-zone climate controls with interior air filter, power tilt/telescopic leather-wrapped steering wheel with radio controls, cruise control, memory system, leather upholstered twelve-way power driver seats, ten-way power passenger seat, power sunroof, a premium sound system with six-disc CD changer, navigation system with voice activation, rearview camera, wireless mobile phone link, universal <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener, and outside-temperature indicator. Options included 14-way power heated/cooled front seats, DVD entertainment system, and upgraded leather upholstery.|$|E
25|$|At 9:45a.m., a {{neighbor}} {{noticed that the}} Ruettens' <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> was open, with no car visible. Approximately 15 minutes later, Ruetten made {{the first of several}} unanswered calls home {{over the course of the}} day. Rasmussen's sister also called without answer. At noon, two men, who the neighbor believed were gardeners in the compound, gave her and her husband a purse they had found that turned out to be Rasmussen's. A maid cleaning a nearby unit said she heard something that sounded like two people fighting, and then something falling, at around 12:30p.m.|$|E
50|$|The <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> are roller shutters, but {{the timber}} frames {{indicate}} that there were originally side-hung double doors.|$|R
50|$|The second garage is {{the larger}} of the two and is just east of the former. It is also rectangular. Three <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> are located on the east-facade. The {{building}} has a hipped roof with exposed rafter tails. It is also in poor conditions, because some wood siding on the south side is missing and the <b>garage</b> <b>doors</b> will not close completely because the building has settled. The exterior is quarry-faced, irregularly-coursed, ashlar sandstone blocks.|$|R

25|$|Lewis Hoad {{was born}} on 23 November 1934, in the working-class Sydney inner suburb of Glebe, the eldest of three sons of tramway {{electrician}} Alan Hoad and his wife Ailsa Lyle. Hoad started playing tennis at age five with a racket gifted by a local social club. As a young child he would wake up at 5 a.m. and hit tennis balls against a wall and <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> until the neighbours complained and {{he was allowed to}} practice on the courts of the Hereford Tennis Club behind the house. At age 10 he competed in the seaside tournament at Manly in the under 16 category.|$|E
25|$|In electronics, {{a remote}} control is a {{component}} of an electronic device used to operate the device wirelessly from a distance. For example, in consumer electronics, {{a remote control}} {{can be used to}} operate devices such as a television set, DVD player, or other home appliance, from a short distance. A remote control is primarily a convenience feature for the user, and can allow operation of devices that are out of convenient reach for direct operation of controls. In some cases, remote controls allow a person to operate a device that they otherwise {{would not be able to}} reach, as when a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> opener is triggered from outside or when a Digital Light Processing projector that is mounted on a high ceiling is controlled by a person from the floor level.|$|E
25|$|Radio {{remote control}} (RF remote control) {{is used to}} control distant objects {{using a variety of}} radio signals {{transmitted}} by the remote control device. As a complementary method to infrared remote controls, the radio remote control is used with electric <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> or gate openers, automatic barrier systems, burglar alarms and industrial automation systems. Standards used for RF remotes are: Bluetooth AVRCP, ZigBee (RF4CE), Z-Wave. Most remote controls use their own coding, transmitting from 8 to 100 or more pulses, fixed or Rolling code, using OOK or FSK modulation. Also, transmitters or receivers can be universal, meaning they are able to work with many different codings. In this case, the transmitter is normally called a universal remote control duplicator because it is able to copy existing remote controls, while the receiver is called a universal receiver because it works with almost any remote control in the market.|$|E

25|$|This large rain-wrapped tornado {{touched down}} at 7:50p.m. CDT (0050 UTC) on May 31, {{southwest}} of Weldon Spring in St. Charles County, Missouri. It first produced EF1 damage as it downed trees, blew over empty trailers, and caused minor damage to construction equipment. It moved generally east-northeast into Weldon Spring Heights (on {{the south side}} of Weldon Spring) and caused roof, window, and solar panel damage to a few structures as well as downing more trees before crossing Interstate 64. The tornado continued moving east-northeast through densely populated residential areas of southern St. Charles County. Roofing was torn off of a middle school and blown , many houses suffered varying degrees of roof (from minor damage to removal of entire roof), wall (from minor damage to total collapse), and overall structural damage, and hundreds of trees were downed. Damage in this area ranged from EF1 to EF2. A shed was destroyed, a <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> was compromised and the roof was removed and blown away, another garage had a wall collapsed, and two more garages were completely destroyed. The tornado reached its maximum intensity to the east-northeast of Weldon Spring, west-southwest of St. Charles and Harvester, and south of St. Peters. Three adjacent frame homes at this location sustained total loss of their roofs and exterior walls, and this small pocket of damage was rated EF3. The tornado continued causing damage in residential areas further to the east and northeast, snapping many trees and causing roof and wall damage to many homes. A few homes had their roofs entirely ripped off, and damage along this portion of the path was rated EF1 to EF2. Crossing the Missouri River, the tornado moved into St. Louis County and Earth City, Bridgeton, and the northern side of Maryland Heights as it moved along Interstate 70 near its intersection with Interstate 270.|$|E
500|$|To {{simulate}} {{the police officer}} falling in the opening scene, the special effects department had the stunt double fall 52feet onto an 18x24feet airbag, which they referred to as [...] "old-fashioned" [...] because they used the airbag rather than wires. Trevor Jones, the stuntman doing the scene, commented during shooting that his fall had a small margin of error, {{because of the small}} airbag and cement walls surrounding the area, [...] "if you land off center maybe three or four feet, then you're going to get pitched in that direction". To aid Jones, a large X was placed on the airbag. A scene later in the episode involves a car fleeing through a <b>garage</b> <b>door,</b> only to hit a concrete wall, flip over, and burst into flames. To create the scene, the crew used two externally identical cars; one was drivable, and the other was a shell of car, and was hooked to a cable rig. After taking a week to get everything set up, the crew used a nitrogen cannon to launch the second, undrivable car through the <b>garage</b> <b>door</b> via wires.|$|E

A tornado in Palm Beach County damaged a few houses and some vegetation in Lake Worth. The other twister in Palm Beach County snapped some trees, blew a gate across a street, and broke a railroad crossing arm. A waterspout offshore Miami-Dade County moved inland near Golden Beach and twisted three gates and blew open a <b>garage</b> <b>door.</b>|$|E
