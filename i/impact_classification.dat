40|$|Feature {{selection}} is often applied to highdimensional data prior to classification learning.

We highlight differences {{and a number}} of potential difficulties with two scoring tools, the Environmental <b>Impact</b> <b>Classification</b> of Alien Taxa (EICAT) and the Generic Impact Scoring System (GISS) using amphibians as a case study. Generally, GISS and EICAT assessments lead to very similar impact levels, but scores from the schemes are not equivalent. Small differences are attributable to discrepancies in the verbal descriptions for scores. Differences were found in several impact categories. While the issue of disease appears to be related to uncertainties in both schemes, hybridisation might be inflated in EICAT. We conclude that GISS scores cannot directly be translated into EICAT classifications, but they give very similar outcomes and the same literature base can be used for both schemes...|$|E

To aid in identifying and defending against cyber attacks we propose a cyber attack taxonomy called AVOIDIT (Attack Vector, Operational Impact, Defense, Information Impact, and Target).

Our fifth category, classification by defense, is used to provide the network administrator with information of how to mitigate or remediate an attack.

40|$|Relational {{classification}} {{has been}} extensively studied recently due to its applications in social, biological, technological, and information networks. Much {{of the work in}} relational learning has focused on analyzing input data that comprise a single network. Although machine learning researchers have considered the issue of how to sample training and test sets from the input network (for evaluation), the mechanisms which are used to construct the input networks have largely been ignored. In most cases, the input network has itself been sampled from a larger target network (e. g., Facebook) and often the researcher is unaware of how the input network was constructed or what impact that may have on evaluation of the relational models. Since the goal in evaluating relational classification algorithms is to accurately assess their performance on the larger target network, it is critical to understand what impact the initial sampling method may have on our estimates of classification accuracy. In this paper, we present different sampling methods and systematically study their impact on evaluation of relational classification. Our results indicate that the choice of sampling method can <b>impact</b> <b>classification</b> performance, and thus consequently affects the accuracy of evaluation...|$|E

40|$|An {{array of}} electret-biased frequency-selective {{resonant}} microelectromechanical system (MEMS) acoustic sensors was proposed to perform analysis of stress pulses created during an impact between two materials. This analysis allowed classification of the stiffness {{of the materials}} involved in the impact without applying post-impact signal processing. Arrays of resonant MEMS sensors provided filtering of the incident stress pulse and subsequent binning of time-domain waveforms into frequency-based spectra. Results indicated that different impact conditions and materials yielded different spectral characteristics. These characteristics, {{as well as the}} resulting sensor array responses, are discussed and applied to <b>impact</b> <b>classification.</b> Each individual sensor element in the array was biased by an in situ charged electret film. A microplasma discharge apparatus embedded within the microsensor allowed charging of the electret film after all device fabrication was complete. This enabled electret film integration using high-temperature surface micromachining processes that would typically lead to discharge of traditionally formed electret materials. This also eliminated the traditional wafer-bonding and post-fabrication assembly processes required in conventional electret integration approaches. The microplasma discharge process and resulting electret performance are discussed {{within the context of the}} MEMS acoustic sensor array. Ph. D.

SWQIA model suggested that water bodies as far as 500  m away from the highway can be affected by road runoff pollution. Spatial analysis of water quality impact due to highway projects in mountainous areas involved weighing of impact criteria and spatial <b>impact</b> <b>classification.</b> These are essential steps in combining and interpreting pollution impacts. These impacts showed high pollution level in the Teesta drainage area mainly due to COD, pH, and TSS. Temporal analysis showed that all the project scenarios had moderate-to-high adverse impact due to water pollution. SESA showed that the overall water quality summarized by WQSI was most sensitive to heavy metal weight followed by COD. Model validation and cross-validation criteria suggested that the model has a good predictive capability and spatial reliability in pollution prediction. This model can be further improved by more detailed meteorological and spatially distributed water quality data. The inclusion of stochasticity in criteria weighing along with attribute SA can substantiate the spatial explicit SA presented here. This SWQIA methodology can also be applied to other project impact analysis by selecting appropriate theoretical models for water pollutants measurement. AHP-based capturing of experts’ as well as people’s perception of impact criteria, geovisualization of impacts, temporal extrapolation of impacts, and SESA can substantially facilitate the decision support system of the project stakeholders.|$|E

Inspired by Gaussian embedding distance and product of Lie Groups distance, we propose an improved Gaussian embedding distance to compare Gaussians. We also evaluate for the first time the image features for GMM matching, including the handcrafted features such as Gabor filter, Local Binary Pattern (LBP) descriptor, SIFT, covariance descriptor and high-level features extracted by deep convolution networks. The experiments are conducted on three texture databases, i. e., KTH-TIPS- 2 b, FMD and UIUC. Based on experimental results, we show that the uses of geometrical structure and balance strategy are critical to ground distances. The experimental results show that GMM with the proposed ground distance can achieve state-of-the-art performance when high-level features are exploited. Department of Computin...|$|E

There are too many objects to classify manually in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey, {{one of the premier}} data sources in astronomy.

The accuracy of the classification is measured on various categories of galaxies from the survey. A three-class algorithm is presented that makes use of mul-tiple SVMs. This algorithm is used to assign the categories of spiral, elliptical, and irregular galax-ies.

However, the impacts that change orders have on labor efficiency are much harder to quantify and are, therefore, a significant risk to contractors. Little research has been completed in the past quantifying these impacts so that disputes are common between owners and contractors regarding the actual cost of change.

The input factors needed for the model are: (1) Total Actual Project Hours, (2) Total Estimated Change Hours, (3) <b>Impact</b> <b>Classification,</b> and (4) Timing of Change. Timing of Change is calculated by breaking the project schedule down into six periods (i. e., changes before construction start, 0 - 20 %, 20 - 40 %, 40 - 60 %A, 60 - 80 %, and 80 - 100 %), listing the percentage of change that occurred in each period, and calculating a weighted timing factor. The model calculates the labor loss or gain in efficiency for a particular project so that owners and contractors will better understand the true change impact on labor efficiency.

The results show that impacted projects have larger amounts of change, have a larger decrease in labor efficiency, and are more impacted by change that occurs later in the project schedule.
