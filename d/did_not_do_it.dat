His death {{sentence}} was decided in {{a second round of}} voting, which was even worse for the philosopher. Nonetheless, Socrates did not lose his calm demeanor and, although during the trial he could propose to the jury his self-exile, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> when his friends offered to help him flee afterward, since life away from his beloved city was pointless for him.|$|E
25|$|Fran√ßois Coignet was a French {{industrialist}} of {{the nineteenth}} century, {{a pioneer in the}} development of structural, prefabricated and reinforced concrete. Coignet was the first to use iron-reinforced concrete as a technique for constructing building structures. In 1853 Coignet built the first iron reinforced concrete structure, a four story house at 72 rue Charles Michels in the suburbs of Paris. Coignet's descriptions of reinforcing concrete suggests that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> for means of adding strength to the concrete but for keeping walls in monolithic construction from overturning. In 1854, English builder William B. Wilkinson reinforced the concrete roof and floors in the two-storey house he was constructing. His positioning of the reinforcement demonstrated that, unlike his predecessors, he had knowledge of tensile stresses.|$|E
25|$|Carla is in {{the frame}} for Tina's murder but after {{evidence}} and his outburst at Tina's funeral, Peter is {{arrested and charged with}} the murder. While in Highfield Prison, Peter meets Jim McDonald, who supplies him with booze while making Peter get son Steve McDonald and Liz to visit. After Peter fails to Jim's command, Jim stops Peter's provision so Peter finds the booze supply and drinks it all, resulting in him being taken to hospital with internal bleeding. Peter later tells Carla he knew she killed Tina even though he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> he will take her secret to the grave. Carla considers going to the police but Rob is adamant she does not. Peter tells Tracy about Jim after he is beaten by Jim's lackeys, so she tells Steve to stop visiting and Jim turns nasty. A terrified Deirdre Barlow asks Jim's ex-wife Liz McDonald to talk to Jim, so she does and Jim leaves Peter alone.|$|E

25|$|Allied Air Forces (AAF) Headquarters was {{established}} under General Douglas Macarthur's South West Pacific Area (SWPA) command on 20April 1942. All Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) flying {{units in the}} theatre, except training squadrons, {{were assigned to the}} control of the AAF commander, Lieutenant General George Brett, along with all United States Army Air Forces (USAAF) and Royal Netherlands East Indies Army Air Force (NEI) units. The RAAF's operational headquarters, including all geographically based area commands, fighter sectors, and combat air bases, were also subordinate to AAF Headquarters. On 3September 1942, the new AAF commander, Major General George Kenney, formed the bulk of his USAAF squadrons into the Fifth Air Force. He then formed the majority of RAAF units, as well as the 49th Fighter Group USAAF, into another organisation, initially known as Coastal Defence Command, with his chief of staff, Air Vice Marshal William (Bill) Bostock, as air officer commanding. The establishment of Coastal Defence Command was officially announced on 8September 1942; the new formation was renamed RAAF Command three days later, as Bostock felt that the previous name <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> justice. The only Australian air combat units in the SWPA not under RAAF Command were those based in New Guinea as No.9 Operational Group RAAF, which was controlled by Fifth Air Force.|$|E
25|$|On April 20, 1865, George Atzerodt, a {{co-conspirator}} in {{the assassination}} of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln, was captured in Germantown. He had been assigned by John Wilkes Booth to assassinate U.S. Vice President Andrew Johnson, but <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> and instead fled Washington, D.C., {{on the night of}} the Lincoln assassination. He was captured at the farm of his cousin Hartman Richter, on Schaeffer Road near Clopper Road. Atzerodt was hanged on July 7, 1865, along with Mary Surratt, Lewis Powell, and David Herold at Washington, D.C.'s Fort McNair. George Atzerodt had come to the town with his family from Prussia when he was about nine years old. When he was about 14 his father moved the family to Virginia, but George still had many friends and relatives in Germantown. He was living in Port Tobacco during the Civil War, and supplementing his meager income as a carriage painter by smuggling people across the Potomac River in a row boat. This clandestine occupation brought him into contact with John Surratt and John Wilkes Booth and he was drawn into a plot to kidnap President Lincoln. On April 14, 1865, John Wilkes Booth gave George Atzerodt a gun and told him that he was to kill the vice president, Andrew Johnson, which he refused to do. George panicked when he found out that Booth had shot President Lincoln and made his way to his cousin's, Hartman Richter's, house in Germantown to hide. He was discovered there by soldiers three days after the assassination and was hanged with other conspirators on July 7.|$|E

He added that the leaked version was an early, unmixed demo recording and, moreover, denied leaking the song, arguing that, {{despite the fact that he}} has been asked to leak the full song, he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it.</b> The musical style of the demo was compared with Spears' 2007 single [...] "Piece of Me", and the song itself generated comparisons with Spears' sound in her fifth studio album Blackout. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone praised Spears' version including it at number twenty-five on his Top 25 Singles of the 2010 list.|$|E

500|$|Dylan first {{recorded}} [...] "Mr. Tambourine Man" [...] {{a few weeks}} later, on June 9, with Tom Wilson producing, during the Another Side of Bob Dylan session. The take, recorded with Ramblin' Jack Elliott, was cut from the album because Dylan felt the song was special and their performance <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it</b> justice. Sometime that month he also recorded a publisher demo of the song at Witmark Music. More than six months passed before Dylan re-recorded the song, again with Wilson in the producer's chair, during the final Bringing It All Back Home session on January 15, 1965, {{the same day that}} [...] "Gates of Eden," [...] "It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)," [...] and [...] "It's All Over Now, Baby Blue" [...] were recorded. It was long thought that the four songs were each recorded in one long take. However, in the biography Bob Dylan: Behind the Shades, Clinton Heylin relates that the song required six attempts, possibly because of difficulties in working out the playoffs between Dylan's acoustic guitar and Bruce Langhorne's electric lead. The final take was selected for the album, which was released on March 22, 1965.|$|E

The Han Chinese Qing general Zuo Zongtang even relocated the Han from the suburbs Hezhou when the Muslims there surrendered as a reward so that Hezhou (now Linxia Hui Autonomous Prefecture) is still heavily Muslim to this day and is the most important city for Hui Muslims in China.

The British were disabused of their expectation of an easy conquest. The unexpected and severe attack made Keane even more cautious...he made no effort to advance on the twenty-fourth or twenty-fifth." [...] As a consequence, the Americans were given time to begin the transformation of the canal into a heavily fortified earthwork. On Christmas Day, General Edward Pakenham arrived on the battlefield and ordered a reconnaissance-in-force on December 28 against the American earthworks protecting the advance to New Orleans. That evening, General Pakenham, angry with the position in which the army had been placed, met with General Keane and Admiral Cochrane for an update on the situation. General Pakenham wanted to use Chef Menteur Road as the invasion route, but he was overruled by Admiral Cochrane, who insisted that his boats were providing everything that could be needed. Admiral Cochrane believed the veteran British soldiers would easily destroy Jackson's ramshackle army, and he allegedly said that if the army <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>do</b> <b>it,</b> his sailors would.
