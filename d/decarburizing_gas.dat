50|$|The term is {{typically}} used in metallurgy, describing {{the reduction of}} the content of carbon in metals (usually steel). Decarburization occurs when the metal is heated to temperatures of 700 Â°C or above when carbon in the metal reacts with gases containing oxygen or hydrogen. The removal of carbon removes hard carbide phases resulting in a softening of the metal, primarily at the surface which are in contact with the <b>decarburizing</b> <b>gas.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Combusted fuel <b>gas</b> (<b>decarburizing,</b> AWS type 2, [...] "endothermic {{generated}} atmospheres"): 70-71% N2, 5-6% CO2, 9-10% CO, 14-15% H2. For copper, silver, copper-phosphorus and copper-zinc filler metals. For brazing copper, brass, nickel alloys, Monel, medium carbon steels.|$|R
