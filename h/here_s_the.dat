40|$|Early in 2003, fresh {{outbreaks}} of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) were declared in Botswana and Mozambique. With annual exports of beef to the European Union worth between t 100 million and t 200 million, Botswana took immediate action: trade was suspended, {{the area in}} question was closed off and 4, 000 head of cattle were slaughtered. Similar measures had been taken in 2002. What is striking is that both countries, as well as nearby Namibia, Swaziland and Zimbabwe, have for decades had vast areas free of FMD. They are all allowed to export boned meat to the EU at low customs duties, under the ACP-EC Cotonou Agreement. Some fear, however, that the EU, which is the principal export market for meat from southern Africa, will {{go as far as}} forbidding all meat imports from the region: it is animal diseases, more than customs duties and quotas, which are now the major obstacle to international trade in animal products. Of late, attention has turned to Zimbabwe, where FMD has been declared virtually every year since 1996. The country s economy is going through a difficult period and lacks hard currency for essential imports; nor has it received any of the aid it requested for the purchase of animal vaccines. With the help of Zimbabwe s weak currency, meat smuggling is now rife and has spread the diseases into neighbouring countries. A study by the International Livestock Research Institute (ILRI) commissioned by the British government has concluded that the abandonment of FMD control measures {{will turn out to be}} a costly mistake for Zimbabwe (official exports were reported down by 80 % in mid-May) and the entire region, whereas they had much to gain from strengthening them. But <b>here</b> <b>s</b> <b>the</b> rub: the costs of the measures are borne by the producer community, whereas the benefits go more to the commercial processing sector than to the poor. No wonder that the report exhorts the private sector to invest in control measures.

40|$|Now here s a new {{management}} theory. Ever tried running an organisation by proverb? It could work. The Yoruba proverb 'Opo Iru ko ba obbe je' literally translated means that 'Plenty of Iru seasoning (from {{the seed of}} the locust-fruit) does not spoil the stew'. Its broader meaning is that 'Good advice never harms, however much be offered'. The {{annual meeting of the}} CTA Advisory Committee, held at CTA headquarters in Wageningen, from 4 to 7 June 2002, was particularly rich in seasoning in its role as a guiding sage. This was its first meeting since the launch of the new Strategic Plan (see Spore 98) and it took the opportunity to express appreciation of the changes in the Centre s orientations. The learning organisation The Committee brimmed with a number of fine-tuning suggestions. The challenge of becoming more of a networking organisation seemed to fascinate it, as it continually urged the Centre to work long and hard on developing genuine relationships (linkages, synergies, partnerships are the terms used) with other fora, organisations, networks and <b>here</b> <b>s</b> <b>the</b> spicy bit 'non-institutionalised initiatives'. A constant thrust of this advice, somewhat less focused on the stand-alone structured regional approach and more on bodies with evident working links, was to better understand the nature and needs of potential partners. In other words, to invest in ties with formal bodies not 'because they are there' but 'because they will work'. The recommended use of information about Spore readers (now emerging in some detail through the Spore User Survey) and of the CTA Website to help target activities, and the judicious development of links with farmers organisations, underline that focus. We need more young people There are few better signs of a networking mind than one which can properly deal with cross-cutting issues, sector-wide approaches and the wider environmental and social context, and these abounded in the Committee s advice. Thus the planned CTA seminar in 2003, which incidentally becomes a flagship event now that CTA only conducts one major seminar annually, should handle its topic of fertiliser use within broader parameters. And talking of cross-cutting issues, youth has been added to the list alongside, amongst others, gender with both being better included in the physical composition of the Committee. The Committee has 30 members, equally divided between representatives of the ACP Group and of the Member States of the European Union. There are three observers, from the Development directorate of the EC, the Secretariat of the ACP-EC Council of Ministers and the ACP General Secretariat; Mr S N Naidu of Mauritius was elected as Chairperson and Mrs H Boulkou of Greece as Vice-Chairperson. They will be joined in the Restricted Group which prepares, monitors and follows up the Committee s work, by Dr D Sène of Senegal and Professor E Tollens of Belgium.
