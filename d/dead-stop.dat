[...] In a positive review, Bruce Fretts of Entertainment Weekly wrote that the movie [...] "succeeds as a character study of a man whose idiosyncratic code of justice eventually catches up with him", and complimented Jeff Bridges' acting as vital to the film's success. [...] Variety, while also praising Jeff Bridges' performance, took a critical stance, observing that the film [...] "comes to a near <b>dead-stop</b> in the final stretch".|$|E
40|$|International audiencePolypropylene/organoclay nanocomposites were {{prepared}} by melt-mixing in a twin-screw extruder. Polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride {{was used as}} compatibilizer. The evolution of the microstructure along the screw profile was characterized through <b>dead-stop</b> experiments. In order to quantify the multi-scale dispersion state of the nanocomposites, different techniques have been used: scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) to observe the large remaining aggregates, X-Ray diffraction measurements to characterize the intercalation state by measuring the interlamellar distance, and finally rheological characterizations in the molten state to assess the dispersion state at the nanoscale. The effects of low barrel temperatures and high matrix viscosity were tested, {{in order to improve}} exfoliation by an increase in shear stresses...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThis {{paper is}} devoted to the study of fiber {{breakage}} during compounding with a polyamide matrix in a Buss kneader. Results showed a drastic decrease of glass fiber length during compounding, typically from 3500 to 350 mu m. Fiber breakage depended on processing conditions: it increased with screw speed, but the effect of feed rate was less clear. Fiber breakage increased also with the severity of the screw profile. Characterizations of fiber length evolution along the screw profile have also been performed after <b>dead-stop</b> experiments. Generally speaking, fiber length evolution can be described using a modified Shon-Liu-White model, in which either the number of turns or the specific energy is considered...|$|E
40|$|International audiencePolypropylene-organoclay based nanocomposites were {{prepared}} via twin-screw extrusion. The effect of different processing parameters on the dispersion state was investigated. Complementary techniques {{were used to}} characterize nanocomposites microstructures. Scanning electron microscopy allows to quantify the remaining agglomerates, whereas X-Ray diffraction focusses on the intercalation of the clay platelets by the polymer chains. Rheological measurements in small amplitude oscillatory shear helps to characterize the nanodispersion of the organoclay. <b>Dead-stop</b> experiments were performed to follow the dispersion state along the screw profile. The {{results show that the}} screw speed plays a major role on the exfoliation, but a compromise has to be found between an efficient dispersion and the matrix thermal degradation. It also appears that both micro-and nanodispersion happens early along the screw profile, and that, in some conditions, the microstructure is established largely before the screw end...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe flow {{of molten}} {{polymers}} in corotating twin screw extruders {{has been largely}} studied, but {{little attention has been}} paid until now to the melting process. In the present work, we develop an experimental study of melting in twin screw extruders, including pressure and temperature measurements, <b>dead-stop</b> experiments and sampling, observation of cross sections and quantification of solid fraction. The influences of process parameters (screw speed and feed rate), screw profile, pellets size and extruder size are also investigated. An original model of the melting process is proposed, deduced from these observations. This model allows one to calculate the evolution of mean shear, rate, pressure gradient, dissipated energy, pellet radius and both solid and liquid temperatures along the screws, for a sequence of right- and left-handed screw elements and blocks of kneading discs. The results of the model are in good agreement with the experiments...|$|E
40|$|International audienceIn {{the present}} study, Polyamide 12 was {{compounded}} with glass fibers in both laboratory and industrial twin screw extruders using various processing conditions (screw speed and feed rate). <b>Dead-stop</b> experiments were performed and {{samples were collected}} at different locations along the screws {{in order to determine}} the fiber length distribution and the extent of fiber breakage. Results show that significant fiber break-up occurs right after the addition of glass fibers to the molten matrix. Similarly fiber length distribution changes drastically at the first sampling location, near the glass fiber feeder. Processing conditions also influence the extent of degradation: it increases with screw speed and decreases with feed rate, which controls the residence time. Flow modelling has been used to calculate the flow conditions along the screw profile. It is shown that the modified Shon-Liu-White model previously proposed to describe the average fiber length evolution as function of specific energy is not able to correctly predict the evolution along the screw profile. In similar processing conditions, the large industrial extruder appears as less severe than the small laboratory on...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, cyclic biamperometry (CB) as a {{new method}} in electrochemistry, has been {{introduced}} and investigated. The hallmark of this method {{is the absence of}} a reference electrode which potentially allows simplification and miniaturization of the measurement apparatus. Similarities and differences of this method and cyclic voltammetry (CV) have been studied and it was shown that under conditions of using standard electrodes, CB has a better sensitivity and a lower detection limit than CV. A new equivalent circuit model for the cell has been proposed and parameters affecting the sensitivity of CB, such as keeping the concentration of one redox species in excess and having a larger W 2 electrode, have been described. The redox cycling effect in biamperometric systems has been investigated and it is shown that improvements of at least two orders of magnitude in sensitivity can be achieved by using interdigitated electrodes (IDEs). In addition, an example for applications of this method, including biamperometric <b>dead-stop</b> titration of 1 -naphthol with ferricyanide, has been presented and possible fields in which CB can be incorporated (e. g. monitoring the activity of alkaline phosphatase) have been illustrated. Finally, a few suggestions for future studies and further improvements have been outlined...|$|E
40|$|The coulometric {{titration}} method {{is combined with}} the use of an enzymatic analytic reagent for the determination of glucose in human serum. The glucose in 25 ii. of serum is determined in a protein-free filtrate (PFF) with an accuracy of ± 3 % and a coefficient of variation of approximately 2 %. The procedure routinely covers a concentration range of 25 - 250 mg/ 100 ml. Calibrations are linear to at least 450 mg. / 100 ml. with zero intercept. Glucose oxidase specifically catalyzes the aerobic oxidation of glucose to hydrogen peroxide. The peroxide reacts with iodide, in the presence of molybdenum (VI) catalyst, to form iodine. A known excess of thiosulfate reduces the iodine as it is produced. The reagents and the sample are incubated at 25. 00 and pH 5. 1. After 15 mm., the pH is adjusted to 8. 0 with phosphate reagent to stop the enzymatic reaction. The residual thiosulfate is titrated coulometrically with iodine at pH 8. 0 to a <b>dead-stop</b> end point at a generating current of 0. 4825 ma. The difference between the sample and thiosulfate reagent titers is proportional to the glucose concentration. The method is empirical.

The {{purpose is to}} optimize the dispersion of the organoclay in the PP matrix {{in order to obtain}} a final product with enhanced mechanical properties (stiffness, impact…). A compatibilizer, polypropylene grafted with maleic anhydride (PP-g-MA), was used in order to improve the chemical affinity between PP and the organoclay. The nanocomposite formulation was: 85 wt% PP / 10 wt% PP-g-MA / 5 wt% organoclay. The influence of screw speed, barrel temperature and matrix viscosity was studied. <b>Dead-stop</b> experiments have been performed, allowing to collect samples all along the screws. The samples were analyzed through scanning electron microscopy, X-Ray diffraction and rheology in small amplitude oscillatory shear. These different techniques allow us to characterize the dispersion state of the organoclay at different scales. The results show that screw speed has a strong impact on the clay exfoliation but is limited by matrix degradation. This degradation is hardly reduced when decreasing barrel temperature and is enhanced with a more viscous matrix. It also appears that intercalation and exfoliation develop early along the screw profile. Depending on the processing conditions, the final dispersion state can be obtained within the first mixing zones and is no more improved afterwards...|$|E
40|$|This project {{considers}} the co-rotating twin screw extrusion of a confectionery paste comprising powdered proteins, sugars, water and fats. As {{is the case}} with many food industry products, this process has been developed experimentally with little quantitative understanding of how variations in processing conditions influence the formation of the extrudate. A variety of techniques have therefore been developed to characterise and quantify the dispersive mixing, distributive mixing and rheological flow properties of this complex, multiphase, viscoelastic, unstable material. These techniques have then been utilised in a pilot plant extruder study of the mechanics of mixing and paste formation during extrusion, considering the influence of both processing conditions and screw profile. The internal evolution of paste microstructure has been successfully tracked along the length of screw profile using <b>dead-stop</b> extractions of the screws. A rigorous off-line assessment of shear yield strength behaviour using cone penetrometry has shown the use of conventional off-line rheometers to be unviable due to rapid post extrusion hardening. This highlighted the need for an in-line rheological measurement technique for continuous extrusion analysis where the extruded material is severely time dependent and not extractable. In pursuit of this, a novel arrangement of bender elements is proposed and trialled, to rapidly characterise material parameters of viscoelastic pastes. A second technique looking to extend the application of shear wave interface reflection to multiphase pastes is also trialled. A novel analysis of thermogravimetric data (TGA) has generated a viable index of distributive mixing, suitable for use on complex multi-component materials where thermal decomposition temperatures of the components are not well defined. Quantitative image analysis of pastes using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), optical microscopy protein staining and a novel application of multiphoton microscopy (MPM) have been used to visualise paste microstructure and quantify dispersive mixing. From the pilot plant extruder study, the application of these techniques was successful in mapping the evolution of paste mixing and the resulting microstructure, as well as identifying key differences between pastes mixed by twin screw extrusion and batch mixing.

Polymer/organoclay nanocomposites can be prepared via different methods but melt-mixing {{has proven to be}} the most effective, and also the most adaptable at an industrial scale. The impact of the melt processing conditions on the dispersion state of the clay in a polypropylene matrix has been recently investigated [3], showing the wide range of processing parameters that can impact the microstructure and the properties of the nanocomposites. This study looks at the preparation of organoclay-based nanocomposites by melt mixing with polypropylene (PP) in a twin-screw extruder. We are interested in the influence of extrusion parameters (screw speed and barrel temperature) on the state of dispersion of the organoclay. The influence of the PP viscosity is also investigated.
