40|$|Contracts create binding legal {{relationships}} between the parties to that contract. In Scotland and England, {{those who are not}} parties to a contract - 'third parties' - only gain rights in restricted circumstances. The existing historic common law rules of third party rights in Scotland, known as <b>jus</b> <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio,</b> lie adrift of commercial practice through lack of use and uncertainty as to their application in reality. Lack of clarity means that there is what the present writer has termed a 'death spiral': lack of use has meant that there is no opportunity for the case law to be clarified and certainty brought to the law; lack of certainty in the law means that the rights are not used. Indeed, they are often expressly excluded, to avoid the risk of their inadvertent creation - and unexpected claims from unexpected quarters...|$|E

5000|$|A {{contract}} made {{in favor}} of a third party is known as a [...] "third-party beneficiary contract."Under traditional common law, the ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio</b> principle was not recognized, instead relying on the doctrine of privity of contract, which restricts rights, obligations, and liabilities arising from a contract to the contracting parties (said to be privy to the contract). However, the Contracts (Rights of Third Parties) Act 1999 introduced a number of allowances and exceptions for ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio</b> in English law. Other common-law countries are also making reforms in this area, though the United States is unique in abandoning privity early in the mid-19th century.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{possible}} to conclude a third-party contract (stipulatio alteri) {{for the benefit of}} a third-party beneficiary (alteri). The third-party beneficiary may claim the benefit only once he has accepted it, and under the ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio</b> principle may sue for performance.|$|R

50|$|In the English Common Law system {{there is}} no {{recognition}} of the principle ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio</b> (a right in the third party to enforce performance) whereby a third party may enforce a promise due unto it under a contract {{to which it is}} not a party. However, in several legal systems, including U.S. and Scots contract law, this does not bar parties to a contract from specifying that a third party is to be a beneficiary of such contract.|$|R
50|$|A {{third-party}} beneficiary, {{in the law}} of contracts, is {{a person}} who may have the right to sue on a contract, despite not having originally been an active party to the contract. This right, known as a ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio,</b> arises when the third party (tertius or alteri) is the intended beneficiary of the contract, as opposed to a mere incidental beneficiary (penitus extraneus). It vests when the third party relies on or assents to the relationship, and gives the third party the right to sue either the promisor (promittens, or performing party) or the promisee (stipulans, or anchor party) of the contract, depending on the circumstances under which the relationship was created.|$|R
50|$|A {{third-party}} beneficiary only acquires a {{right of}} action to enforce his benefit once he has accepted the benefit provided for in the contract. Under the South African interpretation, however, prior to formal acceptance of the benefit, the third-party beneficiary only has a spes, or expectation; in other words, {{he does not have}} the right to accept, but rather a mere competency. Acceptance may also be a suspensive condition in certain contracts. Under Scots law, acceptance is not necessary to be vested in {{a right of}} action, but is necessary to be liable. Before acceptance, however, the ius <b>quaesitum</b> <b>tertio</b> is tenuous so that acceptance of a benefit does not create a right, but rather entrenches that right. In either case, the contracting parties may vary or rescind the contract until acceptance or reliance.|$|R
