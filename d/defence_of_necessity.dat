5|$|There {{are several}} defences to {{trespass}} to land; licence, justification by law, necessity and jus tertii. Licence is express or implied permission, {{given by the}} possessor of land, {{to be on that}} land. If a licence is lawfully revoked, a licence-holder becomes a trespasser if they remain on the land. Justification by law refers to those situations in which there is statutory authority permitting a person to go onto land, such as the Police and Criminal Evidence Act 1984, which allows the police to enter land for the purposes of carrying out an arrest. Jus tertii is where the defendant can prove that the land is not possessed by the claimant, but by a third party, as in Doe d Carter v Barnard. The exception to this defence is if the claimant is a tenant and the defendant a landlord who had no right to give the claimant his lease. Necessity is the situation in which it is vital to commit the trespass; in Esso Petroleum Co v Southport Corporation, the captain of a ship committed trespass by allowing oil to flood a shoreline. This was necessary to protect his ship and crew, however, and the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> was accepted.|$|E
6000|$|Stern {{justice was}} meted out by these {{organized}} avengers, but [...] most remarkable was their passionless and judicial [...] procedure. There were no snap judgments. When {{a man was}} [...] captured he was given fair trial and opportunity for [...] <b>defence.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>necessity,</b> many men were tried and condemned by [...] proxy, {{as in the case}} of General Lampton. This occurred in [...] 2138 A.D. Possibly the most bloodthirsty and malignant of [...] all the mercenaries that ever served the Iron Heel, he was [...] informed by the Fighting Groups that they had tried him, [...] found him guilty, and condemned him to death--and this, [...] after three warnings for him to cease from his ferocious [...] treatment of the proletariat. After his condemnation he [...] surrounded himself with a myriad protective devices. Years [...] passed, and in vain the Fighting Groups strove to execute [...] their decree. Comrade after comrade, men and women, failed [...] in their attempts, and were cruelly executed by the [...] Oligarchy. It was the case of General Lampton that revived [...] crucifixion as a legal method of execution. But in the end [...] the condemned man found his executioner in the form of a [...] slender girl of seventeen, Madeline Provence, who, to [...] accomplish her purpose, served two years in his palace as a [...] seamstress to the household. She died in solitary [...] confinement after horrible and prolonged torture; but to-day [...] she stands in imperishable bronze in the Pantheon of [...] Brotherhood in the wonder city of Serles.|$|E

50|$|Since then, in the 1970s, {{in several}} road traffic cases, {{although}} obiter dicta, {{it has been}} stated {{that there is a}} <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> In Johnson v Phillips 1975, Justice Wein stated that a police constable would be entitled to direct motorists to disobey road traffic regulations if this was reasonably necessary for the protection of life or property. In a later case, Woods v Richards, Justice Eveleigh stated that the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> depended on the degree of emergency which existed or the alternative danger to be averted. In DPP v Harris a police officer, charged with driving without due care and attention through a red traffic light contrary to s 3 of the Road Traffic Act 1988, and having collided with another vehicle containing armed robbers whilst pursuing that vehicle, was not allowed to advance the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity.</b> Again in Chicon v DPP 1994 the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> was not allowed in a case of a pit bull terrier dog being kept in a public place without a muzzle - the owner had removed the muzzle to allow the dog to drink. But in the case of In re F (Mental Patient Sterilization), the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> was allowed. In the case of R v Bournewood Community and Mental Health NHS Trust, the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> (in the case of Tort law) was recognized and applied by the House of Lords to justify the informal detention and treatment of a mentally incompetent person who had become a danger to himself. This approach was subsequently found to be a violation of Article 5 of the European Convention of Human Rights by the European Court of Human Rights in HL v United Kingdom. Subsequent to this decision, individuals who lack capacity must be deprived of their liberty in accordance with the Deprivation of Liberty Safeguards (an amendment to the Mental Capacity Act 2005), not under the common law doctrine of necessity.|$|E

40|$|Military ecocide, the {{destruction}} of the natural environment in the course of fighting or preparing for war, has a long history and remains a regular feature of contemporary conflicts. Efforts to prohibit this in international law were initiated after the US’ notorious defoliation campaign in the Vietnam War in the 1960 s and have advanced since then. Legal ambiguities and the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> military <b>necessity</b> have limited the application of this body of law but the proscription of ecocide has, nonetheless, progressed and looks set to develop further. Normative change driven by scientists, environmentalists and legal experts has raised awareness of and stigmatised such practises to the extent that recourse to the worst excesses of ecocide now appears to have lessened and some recompense for past crimes has been made. Military activities, though, still inflict a heavy cost on the environment...|$|R
5000|$|It was F. H. Bradley's and Josiah Royce's primary {{contention}} that the Self is permeable to all manner of imitation, and that the self as Seth describes is a harmful fiction. At the heart of Seth's analysis was a <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> anthropomorphism, John Ruskin's [...] "pathetic fallacy." [...] "We are anthropomorphic," [...] he affirmed, [...] "and necessarily so, to the inmost fibre of our thinking." [...] He continues: [...] "Every category ... every description of existence or relation, is necessarily a transcript from our own nature and our own experience. Into some of our conceptions we put more, into others less, of ourselves; but all modes of existence and forms of action are necessarily construed by {{us in terms of}} our own life. Everything, down to the atom, is constructed upon the scheme of the conscious self, with its multiplicity of states and its central interpenetrating unity. We cannot rid our thought of its inevitable presupposition." [...] Personality, the true a priori, stands walled off against external phenomenon either in terms of the Absolute, or from the influx <b>of</b> sensation. Seth's <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> personality had a dramatic effect on later, anti-Hegelian and pluralist, thinkers in the United States in particular. William James, George Santayana, Bertrand Russell and George Herbert Mead, all borrowed his concept of the personality, or psyche, and sought it as a barrier against the claims of Gabriel Tarde, F. H. Bradley, and Josiah Royce.|$|R

5000|$|In English law, the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> {{recognises}} {{that there}} may be situations of such overwhelming urgency that a person must be allowed to respond by breaking the law. There have been very few cases in which the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> <b>necessity</b> has succeeded, and in general terms there are very few situations where such a defence could even be applicable. The defining feature of such a defence is that the situation is not caused by another person (which would fall under either duress or self-defence) and that the accused was in genuine risk of immediate harm or danger.|$|E
40|$|The current {{controversy}} surrounding {{the legality of}} torture can only be understood through {{an analysis of the}} distinction between justified necessity and excused necessity. Although there may be strong prudential reasons for international criminal courts to declare torture unlawful under any circumstance, this would not necessarily prevent a court from recognizing that an excuse may apply. However, the hallmark <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> excuse should not be understood, as it is in German law, as an exception that only applies when a defendant breaks the law to save someone close to him. Rather, the basic principle of the excuse ought to be that the impending harm so weighs on the conscience of the defendant that his autonomy is impermissibly infringed by the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> the situation. Given that the prospect of massive casualties might compel a police or military official to engage in torture, the relationship between the defendant and the potential victims is irrelevant. All that matters is that the defendant is torn between, on the one hand, a deontological commitment to treat all suspects humanely, and on the other, a consequentialist concern with the deaths of many innocent victims. Commentators have wrongly assumed that these consequentialist concerns are only relevant for justified necessity. But if a court finds that the pull of the latter is so strong that to resist it would require an act of extreme moral courage, the culpability of the defendant is negated and the <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> excused <b>necessity</b> could be applied...|$|R
40|$|Ibsenâs 1882 An Enemy of the People is {{sometimes}} {{described as a}} problem play, in that it dramatises a compelling debate between two brothers {{about the nature of}} morality and individual responsibility. But that term might obscure the fact that itâs also quite a confused play: Ibsen himself was unsure whether to see it as a comedy or something more serious. It has many of the ingredients of a Restoration-style romp (improbable entrances and exits, characters hiding behind screens to eavesdrop upon their enemies). Yet it also has what Ibsen called a âserious basic themeâ â namely, the question of what happens when an individual forces a society to accept as true something we would much rather ignore. In exploring that issue, Ibsen was responding to the public outcry to Ghosts, a play notoriously described as an âopen sewerâ and a âloathsome sore unbandagedâ by scandalised critics. Ibsenâs hero Dr Stockmann is thus often seen as a surrogate for Ibsen himself, and the playâs suggestion that the truth must be told, whatever the cost, is often viewed as Ibsenâs <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> <b>of</b> plays like Ghosts. But because of that identification between the writer and his hero, itâs sometimes forgotten that Ibsen was ambivalent about Stockmann, describing him as âan oddball and a hothead", while also acknowledging that there was much to admire about him...|$|R

40|$|Defence date: 3 February 2012; Examining Board: Professor Peter Wagner, University of Barcelona and {{formerly}} EUI (Supervisor); Professor Martin Van Gelderen, EUI; Professor Andrew Mason, University of Southampton; Professor Glen Newey, Helsinki CollegiumThe {{object of}} this thesis is to defend ideal political theory {{from a series}} of objections that question its theoretical and practical soundness. My preliminary thesis is that ideal political theory is theoretically as well as practically sufficient in terms of providing us with valid normative prescriptions. The first three chapters explore the nature of ideal political theory and provide a qualified <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> its theoretical force whereas the last three chapters are somewhat more practical and focus on whether and how ideal theory can inform political action. In chapter 1 I provide a critical overview of the most recent debates on the nature of ideal theory and show how these are related to meta-ethics. The aim of chapter 2 is to provide a preliminary <b>defence</b> <b>of</b> the <b>necessity</b> and sufficiency <b>of</b> ideal theory for normatively ranking alternative states of affairs as well as for helping us to decide what to practically do. The aim of chapter 3 is to defend the claim that mere incongruence between a theory and the nonideal circumstances of its application does not constitute an argument against its theoretical and practical soundness. In chapter 4 I argue that a fixation on political feasibility, from the part of contextualist political theorists, comes at the price of theoretical incoherence as well as suboptimal and arbitrary suggestions concerning political reforms. In chapter 5 I engage with the real-world problem of climate change and show how ideal political theory can practically serve as a guide for political action in nonideal circumstances. Finally, in chapter 6, I show in what ways the complex reality of partisan party politics and political pluralism is compatible with ideal political theory...|$|R
