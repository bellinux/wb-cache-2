25|$|Professor Meitner {{stated that}} the success could be {{attributed}} to chemistry. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> slight correction. Chemistry merely isolated the individual substances, it did not precisely identify them. It took Professor Hahn's method to do this. This is where his achievement lies.|$|E

"I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{some of them}} saints. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Enraghty Saint Paul, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> Hingston Saint Peter. You think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> lie to them, {{to deceive}} them, to bewitch them. <b>I</b> didn't <b>have</b> <b>to</b> do {{anything}} of the kind. They did the lying and deceiving and bewitching themselves, and when they done it, they {{and all the rest}} of the believers, they had me fast, faster than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> them." ...|$|R

6000|$|LEVER. [Distressed.] For {{goodness}} sake don't {{look like}} that, Molly! Of course, I'll speak to your Uncle. I'll stop him somehow, even if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fool of myself. I 'll {{do anything you}} want---- ...|$|E
60|$|I'll {{make this}} boys' book {{business}} pay; but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> beginning. When I'm done with YOUNG FOLKS, I'll try Routledge or some one. I feel pretty sure the 'Sea Cook' {{will do to}} reprint, and bring something decent at that.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, a wedding-cake--a {{scrumptious}} wedding-cake, Susan--a beautiful, plummy, eggy, citron-peely wedding-cake. And we {{must make}} other things too. I'll help you in the morning. But I can't help you in the afternoon for <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> wedding-dress and time {{is the essence of}} the contract, Susan." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Madonna," [...] he said, [...] "I {{would to}} Heaven this {{communication}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>to</b> {{you came from}} other lips. In the light of what has passed--here at Roccaleone--through my folly--you--you may think my mission charged with vindictiveness." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Shore. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> say thet. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it strong before thet gang. I reckon it was presumin' of me, an' I shore apologize." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{thought it}} was that woman, but <b>I</b> <b>'ad</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> sure. When it came the third time I crept up to the gate.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will go down}} at once," [...] Ronald said; [...] "they're {{making such}} a noise that it is {{unlikely}} any one outside the hut would hear me, however loud I spoke, while if I waited until it got quieter, I might be heard.

6000|$|... --To return, I wonder, if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{budget of}} such essays as I dream, whether Seeley would publish them: I should give them unity, you know, by the doctrinal essays; nor do I think {{these would be}} the least agreeable. You must give me your advice and tell me whether I should throw out this {{delicate}} feeler to R. S.[16]; or if not, what I am to say to this [...] "proposal" [...] business.|$|E
6000|$|... "So," [...] he answered, [...] "did I. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> certain rather humiliating confession. I, {{who have}} always {{considered}} myself keenly {{in touch with}} the times, especially since my interest in European matters revived, have remained wholly ignorant {{of one of the most}} extraordinary phases of modern politics. In years to come history will show us that it was inevitable, but I must confess that it has come upon me like a thunder clap. I, like all the world, have looked upon Germany and England as natural and inevitable allies. That is neither more nor less than a colossal blunder! As a matter of fact, they are natural enemies!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Studds {{said that}} {{deciding}} not <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a hearing [...] "presented {{me with the}} most difficult choice <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> in my life." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Your pardon," [...] Tom said humbly. [...] "It {{is not a}} {{complaint}} that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make,</b> it is something of real importance which <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> communicate to him." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a strenuous {{effort to}} conceal my agitation. The Rube had most {{carefully}} taken my fool advice {{in the matter}} of wooing a woman.|$|R
6000|$|... "After I {{had left}} you," [...] she went on, [...] "I regretted {{something}} I had said. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> confession--I must make it!" [...] she whispered, brokenly, the instinct {{to indulge in}} warmth of sentiment which had led this woman of passions to respond to Fitzpiers {{in the first place}} leading her now to find luxurious comfort in opening her heart to his wife. [...] "I said to you I could give him up without pain or deprivation--that he had only been my pastime. That was untrue--it was said to deceive you. I could not do it without much pain; and, what is more dreadful, I cannot give him up--even if I would--of myself alone." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Have I {{anything}} to say? Yes, I {{have a deal}} to say. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> clean breast of it all. You can hang me, or you can leave me alone. I don't care a plug which you do. I tell you I've not shut an eye in sleep since I did it, and I don't believe I ever will again until I get past all waking. Sometimes it's his face, but most generally it's hers. I'm never without {{one or the other}} before me. He looks frowning and black-like, but she has a kind o' surprise upon her face. Ay, the white lamb, she might well be surprised when she read death on a face that had seldom looked anything but love upon her before.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Chairman and gentlemen: If {{there is}} one thing I abominate more than another, it is turning out on a cold night like this to eat a huge dinner of twelve courses and know that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> speech on top of it. Gentlemen, I just feel stuffed. That's the plain truth of it. By the time we had {{finished}} that fish, I could have gone home satisfied. Honestly I could. That's as much as I usually eat. And by the time I had finished the rest of the food, I felt simply waterlogged, and I do still. More than that. The knowledge that I had to make a speech congratulating this society of yours on its fiftieth anniversary haunted and racked me all through the meal. I am not, in plain truth, the ready and brilliant speaker you take me for. That is a pure myth. If you could see the desperate home scene that goes on in my family when I am working up a speech, your minds would be at rest on that point.|$|E

60|$|Berwick and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> any {{conversation}} {{that was needed}} {{on the way back}} to Boppard. Rachel did not talk and the Fürstin did not want to.|$|R
5000|$|Paul Goodloe McIntire {{was born}} in 1860 in Charlottesville, Virginia. He {{attended}} the University of Virginia for one session, 1878-1879, and then left [...] "since <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a living." ...|$|R
60|$|I will confess, however, that I have no very full {{sympathy with}} the new Anti-Semitism which is merely Anti-Socialism. There are good, honourable and magnanimous Jews of every type and rank, there are many to whom I am greatly {{attached}} among my own friends in my own rank; but if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> general choice on a general chance among different types of Jews, I have much more {{sympathy with the}} Jew who is revolutionary than the Jew who is plutocratic. In other words, I have much more sympathy for the Israelite {{we are beginning to}} reject, than for the Israelite we have already accepted. I have more respect for him when he leads some sort of revolt, however narrow and anarchic, against the oppression of the poor, than when he is safe {{at the head of a}} great money-lending business oppressing the poor himself. It is not the poor aliens, but the rich aliens I wish we had excluded. I myself wholly reject Bolshevism, not because its actions are violent, but because its very thought is materialistic and mean. And if this preference is true even of Bolshevism, it is ten times truer of Zionism. It really seems to me rather hard that the full storm of fury should have burst about the Jews, at the very moment when some of them at least have felt the call of a far cleaner ideal; and that when we have tolerated their tricks with our country, we should turn on them precisely when they seek in sincerity for their own.|$|E
6000|$|What a blow we {{have all}} had in the deeper blow that has prostrated [...] you! I despair {{to tell you how}} keen and how real a grief is felt [...] here by all who have heard the desolating news. With my own family [...] the {{brooding}} presence of the calamity is almost as obvious as it is [...] in the Kirkland Street home, and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> perpetual effort [...] to reason it down. Reflectively, I confess, I am somewhat surprised [...] that I could have been so much surprised by an event of this [...] order. I know very well that death is the secret of life [...] spiritually, and that this outward image of death which has just [...] obtruded itself upon our gaze is only an image--is wholly unreal [...] from a spiritual point of view. I know in short that your lovely [...] sister lives at present more livingly than she has ever lived [...] before. And yet my life is so low, habitually, that when I am [...] called upon to put my knowledge into practice I am as superstitious [...] as anybody else and grovel instead of soaring. Keep me in your own [...] sweet and fragrant memory, for nowhere else could I feel myself [...] more embalmed to my own self-respect. Indeed if anything could [...] relieve a personal sorrow to me it would be the sense that it was [...] shared by a being so infinitely tender and true as yourself.|$|E
5000|$|... 'If {{you have}} a good restriction, it is really easy: <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> play that will contain an actor who doesn’t know the play, and {{suddenly}} ideas start flooding about devices and models of imparting character.' ...|$|E
60|$|CHLOE. I {{never gave}} a man away or did {{anything}} I was ashamed of--at least--I mean, <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> my living {{in all sorts}} of ways, and then I met Charlie.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Well, my dear,' said Merry, 'the only {{observation}} <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> is, {{that if we}} don't go out at once, I shall certainly take my bonnet off again, {{and stay}} at home.' ...|$|R

50|$|<b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> {{piece of}} {{jewellery}} before I know what it looks like.

I don't want to end up thinking I am smart and clever and using tricks.|$|E
5000|$|I asked DOE {{to widen}} and deepen its investigation, to intensify {{as they were}} {{planning}} their counterintelligence efforts to brief the Congress. Within several weeks the FBI had opened up a full investigation on the prime suspect. So I took the actions that I believe were appropriate. I get {{an awful lot of}} threat information every day. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> judgment as to what I brief the president on and what I don't. In 1997, when this was clearly a pattern and a systemic problem, I thought it was essential for the president to know — Sandy Berger, May 29, 1999.|$|E
50|$|President Klaus Iohannis {{announced}} in 2016 {{that he decided}} to withdraw the Order of the Star of Romania distinction from László Tőkés. “The matter reached my table and <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> decision. In my opinion, we should consider certain issues when analysing such questions. The one who grants a distinction wishes to reward the person distinguished, the one who receives and accepts the distinction must recognise Romania and the Constitution of Romania, to appreciate the values that stay at the grounds of the Constitution of Romania. Considering all this, I have decided to withdraw the “Romania Star” Order from mister László Tőkés,” the head of state said at the Cotroceni Palace.|$|E
