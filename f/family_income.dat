40|$|Using the March Current Population Survey {{data from}} 1984 to 2013, I provide a {{comprehensive}} evaluation of how minimum wage policies influence {{the distribution of}} <b>family</b> <b>incomes.</b> I find robust evidence that higher minimum wages shift down the cumulative distribution of <b>family</b> <b>incomes</b> at the bottom, reducing the share of non-elderly individuals with incomes below 50, 75, 100, and 125 {{percent of the federal}} poverty threshold. The long run (3 or more years) minimum wage elasticity of the non-elderly poverty rate with respect to the minimum wage ranges between - 0. 22 and - 0. 55 across alternative specifications that subsume most of the approaches used in the literature to construct valid counterfactuals. Inverting the policy's effect on the cumulative distribution, I estimate minimum wage elasticities for unconditional quantiles of <b>family</b> <b>incomes.</b> The long run minimum wage elasticities for the 10 th and 15 th unconditional quantiles of equivalized <b>family</b> <b>incomes</b> range between 0. 15 and 0. 49 depending on specification.
