The girl even goes to the boy's door to gift him flowers, thereby reversing the usual gender-directed pattern of gift-giving. The male protagonist is portrayed as a [...] "perfect boy" [...] (played by William Fitzgibbon) having the sensibilities like attentiveness, cuteness, playfulness like a friend (after the lyrics [...] "You're my best friend") and not sexual overtones. The video in-turn contrasts him with a self-centered boy who puts on sunglasses, throws his leather jacket {{over his shoulder and}} walks away from the girl. Other videos portrayed a girl pining for her sailor, US-Soviet relations and an arguing couple with the girl in a scene inspired by the music video of Tina Turner's 1984 single [...] "What's Love Got to Do with It".|$|E

In the process, he lost a year at school, but was later allowed to make up by accelerating his studies. His wedding was a joint event, where his brother and cousin were also married. Recalling the day of their marriage, he once said, [...] "As we didn't know much about marriage, for us it meant only wearing new clothes, eating sweets and playing with relatives." [...] However, as was prevailing tradition, the adolescent bride was to spend much time at her parents' house, and away from her husband. Writing many years later, Mohandas described with regret the lustful feelings he felt for his young bride, [...] "even at school I used to think of her, and the thought of nightfall and our subsequent meeting was ever haunting me." [...] He later recalled feeling jealous and possessive of her, such as when she would visit a temple with <b>her</b> <b>girlfriends,</b> and being sexually lustful in his feelings for her.|$|E

What came next for the twosome has become {{to be known as}} [...] "The Couch Chronicles" [...] where Robin bought a leather couch for Patrick (since he was none too eager to buy furniture for himself, and Robin saying she enjoyed that sort of decorating), Patrick taking back the couch (after his friend Pete Marquez scared him believing Robin had ulterior motives), Patrick reordering the couch, Robin insisting he take it back and finally Robin seeing he liked the couch (this and agreeing to move in with him, which was also a source of argument for the two in between the couch fighting). Robin moved in for one day, and by the next Pete was over trying to get Patrick to leave for Vegas to reprogram him. It wasn't until Noah came by offering his congratulations that Patrick felt backed into a corner and left with Pete for Las Vegas.

2500|$|Critics such as Baptist pastor Jerry Vines and the Dutch Party for Freedom leader Geert Wilders {{have cited}} {{the age of}} Aisha to {{denounce}} Muhammad for having {{had sex with a}} nine-year-old, referring to Muhammad as a pedophile. An early 20th century adherent of the Arya Samaji Hindu movement wrote in Rangila Rasul that Aisha was {{about the same age as}} Muhammad's granddaughter, and a better way for Muhammad to make Abu Bakr (Aisha's father) a relative would have been to adopt Aisha as his own daughter and marry her off. It is described in Bukhari that Aisha, while living with Muhammad, used to play with dolls along with <b>her</b> <b>girlfriends.</b> According to Katherine Zoepf, this description emphasising Aisha's childishness despite being married to a man then in his early fifties [...] "can make for upsetting reading." [...] Jeremy Stangroom and Ophelia Benson argue that Aisha [...] "was much too young to have offered anything like her informed consent , even if it had been sought". They also argue, [...] "there are difficulties in dismissing any of Muhammad's actions as simply being the product of his time given the status accorded to his life among Muslims." [...] They note that his life is considered exemplary for Muslims and one to which all Muslim men should aspire, quoting Kecia Ali: [...] "accepting the rightness of his act raises the question: on what basis can one reject the marriage of young girls today?" [...] Stangroom and Benson compare the practice of child marriage to that of colonial slavery, arguing that both practices were legal at the time but are now seen as inherently immoral.|$|E
