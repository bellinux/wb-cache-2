30|$|In this section, it is {{essential}} to determine first whether various types of jamming influence PDR or not by performing the statistical <b>test</b> (<b>T</b> <b>test).</b> Next, <b>T</b> <b>test</b> is used to fix the PDR threshold. The <b>T</b> <b>test</b> proves that there is {{a significant difference between the}} two population means (i.e., observed PDR during jamming-free scenario and observed PDR after the launching of jamming). By using the mean of samples, the PDR threshold is fixed. Lastly, by using PDR and RSSI threshold, the presence of jamming is determined. However, it is not sufficient to determine the presence of jamming alone, but further it is necessary to determine the type of jamming launched (constant or deceptive or random or reactive jamming). In order to find the type of jamming launched in the network, <b>T</b> <b>test</b> is performed on the two sets viz observed PDR during jamming-free scenario and observed PDR after launching a specific type of jamming. The <b>T</b> <b>test</b> proves that there is a significant difference between the two means. Therefore, by using the mean PDR of the jammed member as reference value, the types of jamming are classified (all the <b>T</b> <b>tests</b> are performed by using samples obtained from our simulation).|$|R

3000|$|To {{identify}} differentially expressed {{genes in}} the chromosomal region where the mutation was mapped, we used independent <b>t</b> <b>tests</b> (Pan 2002). We adopted a less stringent test as we were primarily interested in finding candidates in the target region and less concerned with having false positives. The independent <b>t</b> <b>test</b> for each experiment was able to detect genes that were significantly expressed even with low expression ratios because unknown error variance components were estimated based on a gene-specific variance for each gene. For the independent <b>t</b> <b>tests,</b> the significant differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were first determined for each rice entry-treatment comparison (e.g., G 978 inoculated vs. water, three bioreps) using one-class <b>t</b> <b>test</b> for each gene. The mean of gene expression (log 2 ratio) for three biological replicates was tested for significant difference against zero (no difference in gene expression between samples compared). Significant DEGs between the resistant and susceptible entries were then <b>tested</b> using two-class <b>t</b> <b>test,</b> with G 978 as class A and IR 64 as class B, using three replicates. Each <b>t</b> <b>test</b> generated a list of significant and non-significant genes. At each time point, from the DEGs set, the subsets of genes that were significantly differentially induced (DI genes) by blast inoculation in G 978 were determined by the Boolean join.

40|$|Rule {{learning}} algorithms, for example, RIPPER, induces univariate rules, that is, a propositional {{condition in}} a rule uses only one feature. In this paper, we propose an omnivariate induction of rules where under each condition, both a univariate and a multivariate condition are trained, {{and the best}} is chosen according to a novel statistical test. This paper has three main contributions: First, we propose a novel statistical test, the combined 5 x 2 cv <b>t</b> <b>test,</b> to compare two classifiers, which is {{a variant of the}} 5 x 2 cv <b>t</b> <b>test</b> and give the connections to other tests as 5 x 2 cv F test and k-fold paired <b>t</b> <b>test.</b> Second, we propose a multivariate version of RIPPER, where support vector machine with linear kernel is used to find multivariate linear conditions. Third, we propose an omnivariate version of RIPPER, where the model selection is done via the combined 5 x 2 cv <b>t</b> <b>test.</b> Our results indicate that 1) the combined 5 x 2 cv <b>t</b> <b>test</b> has higher power (lower type II error), lower type I error, and higher replicability compared to the 5 x 2 cv <b>t</b> <b>test,</b> 2) omnivariate rules are better in that they choose whichever condition is more accurate, selecting the right model automatically and separately for each condition in a rule.
