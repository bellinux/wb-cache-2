50|$|The first {{computer}} monitors used cathode ray tubes (CRTs). Prior to {{the advent of}} home computers in the late 1970s, it was common for a video display terminal (VDT) using a CRT to be physically integrated with a keyboard and other components of the system in a single large chassis. The display was monochrome and far less sharp and detailed than on a modern <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor,</b> necessitating the use of relatively large text and severely limiting {{the amount of information}} that could be displayed at one time. High-resolution CRT displays were developed for specialized military, industrial and scientific applications but they were far too costly for general use.|$|E
50|$|An audio DJ uses {{headphones}} so the DJ {{can hear}} the unmixed output of each turntable independently in order to queue up the next track. A DVJ needs similar capabilities with video, which requires multiple displays. With component-based systems, a small <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor</b> or TV needs {{to be set up}} for each player and given the raw video feed of the player through a Y-splitter cable. With a computer setup, the computer or laptop must have two video outputs; the primary screen has both sources and the mixed output shown, and the mixed output sent out the secondary output to the house, and commonly a monitor for the DVJ. This setup saves space needed in the DJ booth from 3 monitors plus a controller down to the pc/laptop(s) and an output monitor. As better technologies, formats and resolutions are available, these systems can also be upgraded to support them, a major point over component systems.|$|E

40|$|Virtual Tomographic Reflection (VTR) {{is a new}} {{augmented}} reality technique that allows users to view volumetric image data using an interaction paradigm based on medical ultrasound. VTR is essentially a “virtual ” version of the Sonic Flashlight, a a device that permits real-time in situ visualization of ultrasound images by reflecting calibrated images displayed on a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor</b> from a partially transparent half silvered mirror [13], where the actual ultrasound scanner is replaced by an optical tracking / computer system capable of generating cross-sections through stored image data. The design of this system was motivated {{by the need to}} conduct psychophysical and accuracy analysis of the real Sonic Flashlight in a highly controlled artificial environment [12]. Here we present the fully developed version of our Virtual Tomographic Reflection (VTR) device and describe the overall system architecture as well as a highly accurate method for calibrating the system.

40|$|Augmented reality systems show {{great promise}} for {{improving}} the ability of medical personnel to incorporate image guidance into {{a wider variety of}} procedures than they are currently able. In its present form, medical image guidance often requires that patients be moved to a specialized interventional radiology suite and that specially trained personnel conduct the image guided therapy. Much of the difficulty in medical image guidance centers on mentally fusing the medical image with the patient’s body. Augmented reality systems can alleviate this difficulty be visually fusing the medical image with the patient’s body, allowing much more natural guidance. Among the questions that can be asked about augmented reality systems in medicine are A) “Do these systems actually improve the ability of medical personnel to treat patient? ” and B) “How do these systems affect perception of the medical image information?” This dissertation focuses on the Sonic Flashlight, an augmented reality device that provides realtime in situ visualization of ultrasound images by reflecting calibrated images displayed on a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor</b> from a partially transparent half silvered mirror.

40|$|In {{the past}} decade, {{collaborative}} technology has become widely integrated into many professional training settings, yet at present we lack a {{complete understanding of}} how new technology alters networks of social and technology- mediated interactions present in such environments. Boulos et al. (2006) note that many Web 2. 0 applications offer many unique and powerful information-sharing features for collaborative clinical practice and learning. However, {{they point out that}} much careful thinking and research are still needed in order to find the best ways to leverage these emerging tools to boost teaching and learning efficacy and foster better 'communities of practice' (Wenger 1998). I have been engaged in a multi-year ethnography-for-design study in a dental hygiene training program in San Diego, CA. In this research project, I performed an ethnographic analysis of instructional practices used in hands-on, clinical instruction, and participated in the design of a new clinical training laboratory. The new lab was equipped with embedded digital media technology, such as <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitors,</b> computer workstations and overhead cameras, through which students and instructors could access a video blogging ('vlogging') system while in the clinic. Chapter 2 discusses the field site in more depth, including a detailed account of the negotiation process and my ethical stance towards doing participatory ethnography with an intervention/design component. In Chapter 3, I explore the question of how expert bodies shape the bodies of novices. I look deeply into the special character of what's being learned in hands-on training environments like dental hygiene, and how instructors employ specific discursive practices to help in training the bodies of novices to perceive and act to professional standards. The fourth chapter details the implementation phase of the project, in which I helped design a new clinical training laboratory, equipped with embedded digital media technology, such as <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitors,</b> computer workstations and overhead cameras. I describe how we implemented a collaboratively built video blog ('vlog') in the fall of 2005. As practitioners adapted to the new technologies and representations that were made available, they transformed their practices. A discussion of how organizational practices shifted makes up Chapter 5. In this chapter, I examine how interactions with videos structured the way students and instructors work with each other in the clinic. In Chapter 6, I investigate some of the organizational factors involved in the appropriation of the new technology implemented in 2005 and 200...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Scaled {{teleoperation}} {{is increasingly}} prevalent in medicine, {{as well as}} in other applications of robotics. Visual feedback in such systems is essential and should make maximal use of natural hand-eye coordination. This paper describes a new method of visual feedback for scaled teleoperation in which the operator manipulates the handle of a remote tool {{in the presence of a}} registered virtual image of the target in real time. The method adapts a concept already used successfully in a new medical device called the Sonic Flashlight, which permits direct in situ visualization of ultrasound during invasive procedures. The Sonic Flashlight uses a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor</b> and a half-silvered mirror to merge the visual outer surface of a patient with a simultaneous ultrasound scan of the patient’s interior. Adapting the concept to scaled teleoperation involves removing the imaging device and the target to a remote location and adding a master-slave control device. This permits the operator to see his hands, along with what appears to be the tool, and the target, merged in a workspace that preserves natural hand-eye coordination. Three functioning prototypes are described, one based on ultrasound and two on light microscopy. The limitations and potential of the new approach are discussed.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The goal of {{this study}} was to design a human-computer {{interface}} that would increase the memorability of information presented by providing context as compared with memory with no context. Our focus was in augmenting context-dependent mem-ory because it is a powerful and often unexploited characteristic of human cognition. To amplify this cognitive strength, we built the InfoCockpit, which included a large screen containing projected images of places, a three-dimensional surround-sound system that played ambient noises congruent with the projected images, and a <b>flat-panel</b> <b>monitor</b> that served as the focal display for the presentation of the to-be-remembered information. Participants in our study learned and recalled information in either the InfoCockpit or a standard desktop environment. The InfoCockpit group demonstrated a 131 % memory advantage. Contextual factors that were previously found to be effective in isolation created a large effect when presented in combination. CONTEXT-DEPENDENT MEMORY REFERS TO THE FINDING THAT PEOPLE ARE OFTEN BETTER AT remembering information if they return to the place where it was encountered or if they imagine themselves to be in that place. To experience this phenomenon, try to remember what you had for lunch on Wednesday of last week. An effective retrieval strategy is first to recall what you were doing last Wednesday and where you were when you had lunch.

5000|$|The first {{engineering}} {{proposal for}} a flat-panel TV was by General Electric {{as a result of}} its work on radar monitors. Their publication of their findings gave all the basics of future <b>flat-panel</b> TVs and <b>monitors.</b> But GE did not continue with the R&D required and never built a working flat panel at that time. The first production flat-panel display was the Aiken tube, developed in the early 1950s and produced in limited numbers in 1958. This saw some use in military systems as a heads up display, but conventional technologies overtook its development. Attempts to commercialize the system for home television use ran into continued problems and the system was never released commercially. The Philco Predicta featured a relatively flat (for its day) cathode ray tube setup and would be the first commercially released [...] "flat panel" [...] upon its launch in 1958; the Predicta was a commercial failure. The plasma display panel was invented in 1964 at the University of Illinois, according to The History of Plasma Display Panels. The first active-matrix addressed display was made by T Peter Brody's Thin-Film Devices department at Westinghouse Electric Corporation in 1968. In 1977, James P Mitchell prototyped and later demonstrated what was perhaps the earliest monochromatic flat panel LED television display LED Display. , 50% of global market share in flat-panel display (FPD) production is by Taiwanese manufacturers such as AU Optronics and Chimei Innolux Corporation.|$|R
