5000|$|I don’t {{want to be}} {{qualified}} as a female singer. I {{just want to be}} a singer. And I don’t think you should {{be qualified}} by your gender. That’s always bullshit. And unfortunately, it’s probably not going to change in my lifetime. But I just want to be considered a good lyricist and a good singer, not a “girl” singer or a “girl” lyricist. That’s not relevant. Just evaluate me on my music and my lyrics and I'll be happy. Gretchen Seager DeSantis recalled:So many of the stories that women were able to tell in ROCKRGRL were stories they weren’t able to tell in any place else. What was different about ROCKRGRL was {{that a lot of the}} artists we talked to had cautionary tales. My favorite artists to talk to are the ones who can talk honestly about what happened.

The actors can play closer to their age, and we've {{done a lot of}} what we would do in college in high school, in terms of that accelerated behavior. The other cool thing it does, and this was not by design, I'm not smart enough to design it this way, but the fact that Lucas and his mom and his dad, Dan, the fact that there was history, that we can always reach back and grab a piece of something over the last four years, like what happened with Dan and Karen, what happened before Lucas joined the team, etc. Like we dropped the audience into this world, but there was so much life before that, that you could always go back and grab a piece when you needed it.
