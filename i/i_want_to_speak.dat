500|$|Drawing {{influence}} {{from a more}} diverse array of musical styles than Residente o Visitante (2007), Calle 13 released Los de Atrás Vienen Conmigo in 2008, which experimented with genres such as samba, candombe, and electronica. The album won five Latin Grammys at the Latin Grammy Awards of 2009 including [...] "Album of the Year". The group generated controversy when vocalist/lyricist Residente was hosting the 2009 MTV Latin America Awards and attempted to inform the audience about a strike in Puerto Rico in protest of governor Luis Fortuño's cutting of thousands of government jobs, one of which belonged to Residente's mother. During the ceremony, he referred to Fortuño as a [...] "son of a whore", which generated widespread anger towards the group. Reflecting on the incident [...] "I was upset, really upset. But I'm a little more strategic now - <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> the truth, but I don't want to diminish the merits of what I'm saying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Near {{the end of}} the campaign, Dion had an {{interview}} with CTV Halifax's anchor Steve Murphy, where Dion asked the host three times to restart the interview because he didn't understand the mixed tense and timing of a question about the economy: [...] "If you were Prime Minister now, {{what would you have done}} about the economy and this crisis that Mr. Harper has not done?" [...] Murphy initially agreed not to air it but network executives decided to release it, generating controversy. On election night, Dion angrily refused to speak to the CTV reporters scrumming around him, saying [...] "The last one <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> first [...] is CTV - you understand that?".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, how my {{poor boy}} cries! Hush, hush! Now, make me one promise. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Agnes. When you go downstairs, tell Agnes so, and send {{her up to}} me; and while I speak to her, let no one come--not even aunt. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Agnes by herself. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to Agnes, quite alone.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> {{you about}} something, and I thought Aunt Alice should be present.|$|R
6000|$|... "My dear Prince," [...] said Vivian to the Grand Marshal, [...] "you {{are just}} the person <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to.</b> How came you to invite Beckendorff, and how came he to accept the invitation?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Thank you, yes; I've got to dine {{with these}} fellows at the Railway Hotel at eight, but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you first, Wilmet,' said Mr. Audley, sitting {{down as if}} he were weary of his day.|$|R
60|$|NORA. Mr Keegan: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you {{a minute}} if you don't mind.|$|E
60|$|JAMES. Wait a few minutes, would you? <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to {{you about}} this lease.|$|E
60|$|MRS. ALLONBY. Lord Illingworth, <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> {{to you for}} a moment. Do come over.|$|E
6000|$|... "All along," [...] she continued, [...] "ever since father saw you yesterday, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you. Silly conventionality kept me back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Then {{you don't}} {{think he is}} getting any better, Sir?' said Mrs. King, keeping close to him. 'I thought he was yesterday, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you. My oldest {{daughter}} thought {{if we could get}} him away to the sea, and--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'On Herr Muller's days, {{because he}} only {{comes in the}} afternoon,' said Robina; 'but I am rather glad; <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you, Felix.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{could not}} help saying this in passing. But {{it is not what}} the text is {{speaking}} of; not what <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of myself to-day. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> of a matter which is smaller, and not by any means so sinful: and which yet in practice is often more tormenting to a truly tender conscience, because it is more common and more continual.|$|E
60|$|You can't get round me with polite words. I'm sick of all that. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> straight.|$|E
60|$|LIEUTENANT. I'm {{not going}} just yet. Go {{and find the}} General, and tell him <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to him.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'm {{disturbing}} you, aunt," [...] said Fanny, [...] "but <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you for {{a minute}} or two. Good morning, Mrs Griffiths." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{affected}} not {{to perceive}} the incident, and presently said that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> Clive in his studio. Knowing that I had brought my friend one or two commissions for drawings, Mrs. Mackenzie was civil to me, and did not object to our colloquies.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You must {{forgive me}} for forcing myself upon you to-day,' he said slowly. 'But my time is very short, and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you at once.' ...|$|R
60|$|VIVIE. I am {{glad you}} have come: <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you. You {{said you were}} going, Frank, I think.|$|E

6000|$|... 'It was {{not about}} that <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you, though,' said Mr. Audley. 'I <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> know whether you have any plans or wishes for the future.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Forster {{said of his}} writing, [...] "The lyrics I {{wrote on}} this album, I wrote when I've been drinking. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> a lot more {{directly}} and <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> about certain topics in a very straightforward way. And the best way I found of doing that was by sitting down and drinking. A conversational-type lyric. Most of the lyrics I've done on that album were started at night. I'd start drinking, smoking cigarettes, and I'd write all the lyrics in one sitting. I think it shows." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Much the same, thank you, uncle," [...] said Tom, feeling nervous. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you, please, when you're at liberty." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Mr. Copperfield,' said Miss Mills, 'come to {{this side}} of the {{carriage}} a moment--if you can spare a moment. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "If you please, miss, <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you. <b>I</b> {{have got}} a little girl here, and <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> send her to school, only I have no shoes for her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am afraid}} {{that you are in}} a {{dangerous}} state," [...] Courtlaw answered gravely. [...] "The nurse will fetch the doctor directly. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... “There {{was another}} small matter,” he {{began in a}} {{detached}} tone, “which <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> your husband about. There came into our hands a—a—what we believe is—a stolen overcoat.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Angela," [...] {{called her}} father one day, {{as he heard}} her {{footsteps}} passing his study, [...] "come in here; <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Cain, go to {{the lower}} mead and catch the bay mare. I'll turn the winch of the grindstone. <b>I</b> <b>want</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> to you, Gabriel." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I'm afraid I'm {{too old for}} both," [...] {{said the}} old lady, [...] "though I've often thought they must be delightfully soothing. <b>I</b> <b>wanted</b> <b>to</b> <b>speak</b> <b>to</b> you about your neighbour." ...|$|R
