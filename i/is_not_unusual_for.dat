5|$|Lactarius vietus milk has a {{very hot}} taste, and the {{mushroom}} lacks a distinctive smell. Although described by many mycologists as inedible, David Pegler claims that its acrid taste can be removed after boiling, allowing it to be consumed. Though the strong, acrid taste is {{a defining feature of}} the species, it is weaker or even absent in some older mushrooms, which <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> Lactarius species. Occasionally, however, mushrooms of the species have been collected which have a mild taste; this has also been observed in other species with typically acrid tastes.|$|E
5|$|Village Roadshow Theme Parks, {{the owners}} of Warner Bros. Movie World {{attributed}} a rise in attendance {{to the opening of}} the Green Lantern Coaster. The company labelled the launch of the ride as a success. The attraction's downtime has been reported several times by local media, however, this behaviour <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> amusement rides. Green Lantern Coaster, along with other El Loco roller coasters, ranked 182 out of the 365 steel roller coasters in the worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll for 2012.|$|E

5|$|The United States Military Academy (USMA) is an {{undergraduate}} college in West Point, New York {{with the mission}} of educating and commissioning officers for the United States Army. The list is drawn from non-graduate former cadets and cadet candidates. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> the service academies to have high dropout rates. Of the original 103 cadets in the Class of 1826, only 43 graduated. Non-graduates of the Academy have entered a variety of fields. Notable non-graduates include Edgar Allan Poe (literature), James Abbott McNeill Whistler (art), Maynard James Keenan (music), Adam Vinatieri (football), and even the military: Jacob Zeilin, Lewis Addison Armistead, and Courtney Hodges.|$|E
5|$|Cats {{who live}} {{outside of the}} Clans are split into three groups. Housecats, known as 'kittypets', are often sneered at by the Clan cats for their cozy and lazy life. Occasionally a curious kittypet will wander into the forest to explore; at this point, they are chased away, but will rarely come to harm. As a result, kittypets often warn each other not to enter the forest. 'Loners' are cats who walk outside of the Clans, usually by themselves. Although {{regarded}} by the Clans with suspicion, they do not cause the forest cats any trouble, and so are free to wander outside of the borders in peace. Similar to loners are 'rogues', who differ only because they intentionally try to cause the Clans harm. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a rogue to be a former Clan cat looking for revenge. For a kittypet, loner or rogue to join a Clan is rare, but not unheard of. Often, these newcomers have to prove themselves {{in order to be}} regarded with trust {{by the rest of the}} community.|$|E
25|$|Early season {{instability}} <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> some of {{the teams}} in the AIHL, especially those {{who are able to}} recruit professional hockey players. The Ice Dogs, North Stars and Blue Tongues especially struggle to find consistency early in the season.|$|E

25|$|Washington and Lee's honor {{system does}} not have a list of rules that define {{punishable}} behavior—beyond the traditional guide of the offenses lying, cheating or stealing.

25|$|After {{the growth}} period, when the meristems are dormant, {{the leaves are}} sources, and storage organs are sinks. Developing seed-bearing organs (such as fruit) are always sinks. Because of this {{multi-directional}} flow, coupled {{with the fact that}} sap cannot move with ease between adjacent sieve-tubes, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> sap in adjacent sieve-tubes to be flowing in opposite directions.|$|E
25|$|It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> small {{sections}} of the parkway to be temporarily closed to repair damage caused by the cold winter climate of the mountains or for other maintenance. Detours caused by these closures are well-marked, and are arranged to cause as little disruption as possible, though maintenance such as repaving only warrants a stop/slow switch with a one-lane only restriction.|$|E
25|$|At {{any given}} year -should the Indios {{make it to the}} PRBL tournament playoffs- {{attendance}} to the team's baseball park and post-game celebrations tend to be particularly high because they usually coincide with the celebration of the patron saint feasts (fiestas patronales) for the city of Mayagüez; it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a championship game to coincide with Candlemas (2 February) or Candlemas Eve.|$|E

25|$|Pronunciation of Swedish names is similar, {{but long}} vowels are not doubled and the stress {{may be on}} any syllable.

25|$|When {{the weather}} gets colder, {{and the water}} {{temperature}} drops below 15 C (60 F), smallmouth will often migrate in search of deeper pools in which they enter a semi-hybernation state, moving sluggishly and feeding very little until the warm season returns. The migration patterns of smallmouth have been tracked and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> a smallmouth to travel 12 miles {{in a single day}} in a stream, creek or river. The overall migration can exceed 60 miles.|$|E

25|$|Detective sergeants {{are equal}} in rank to their uniformed counterparts; only the prefix 'detective' {{identifies}} them as having completed {{at least one}} of the various detective training courses authorising them to conduct and/or manage investigations into serious and/or complex crime. In British police services, not all officers deployed in plain clothes are detectives, and not all detectives are deployed within the CID. Thus, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> detectives to supervise uniformed officers and vice versa.|$|E
25|$|In captivity, {{they can}} be seen to be {{constantly}} playing, vocalizing, and swimming around each other.

It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> an aquarium handler to be drenched by one of his charges. Some researchers believe spitting originated with blowing sand away from crustaceans at the sea bottom.|$|E
25|$|Arachnids {{are mostly}} carnivorous, feeding on the pre-digested bodies of insects {{and other small}} animals. Only in the harvestmen and among mites, such as the house dust mite, is there {{ingestion}} of solid food particles, and thus exposure to internal parasites, although it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>unusual</b> <b>for</b> spiders to eat their own silk. Several groups secrete venom from specialized glands to kill prey or enemies. Several mites and ticks are parasites, {{some of which are}} carriers of disease.|$|E
