2500|$|While {{the law on}} {{disclosure}} and misrepresentation aims to make contracting parties informed (or not disinformed), the law also says agreements may be avoided when, in a very general sense, a person's free will was impaired. Complete exercise of [...] "free will" [...] is rare for most people, because they make choices within a constrained range of alternatives. The law still holds people to nearly all contracts (if consumer, employment, tenancy, etc. legislation is not activated) except where someone was under duress, unduly influenced or exploited while in a vulnerable position. Like misrepresentation, the victim may avoid the contract, and the parties restore their property to reverse unjust enrichment, subject to the victim's claim for damages, so long as none of the four equitable bars to rescission lie (i.e. no excessive lapse of time, affirmation of the contract, intervention of an innocent third party's rights and counter-restitution is possible). The most straight forward claim, for duress, involves illegitimate threats. The common law long allowed a claim if duress was of a physical nature. So long as a threat {{is just one of}} the reasons a person enters an agreement, even if not the main reason, the agreement may be avoided. Only late in the 20th century was escape allowed if the threat involved illegitimate economic harm. A threat is always [...] "illegitimate" [...] if it is to do an unlawful act, such as breaking a contract knowing non-payment may push someone out of business. However, threatening to do a lawful act will usually not be illegitimate. In Pao on v Lau Yiu Long the Pao family threatened to not complete a share swap deal, aimed at selling their company's building, unless the Lau family agreed to change a part of the proposed agreement to guarantee the Paos would receive rises in the swapped shares' prices on repurchase. The Laus signed the <b>guarantee</b> <b>agreement</b> after this threat, and then claimed it was not binding. But the Privy Council advised their signature was only a result of [...] "commercial pressure", not economic duress. The Laus' considered the situation before signing, and did not behave like someone under duress, so there was no coercion amounting to a vitiation of consent. However, contrasting to cases involving business parties, the threat to do a lawful act will probably be duress if used against a vulnerable person. An obvious case involving [...] "lawful act duress" [...] is blackmail. The blackmailer has to justify, not doing the lawful act they threaten, but against a person highly vulnerable to them, the demand of money.|$|E

Fu Chip bought all the shares in Shing On, and Pao received as payment 4.2m shares in Fu Chip (worth $2.50 for each $1 share). To ensure the share price of Fu Chip suffered no shock, Pao agreed to not sell 60% of the shares for at least one year. Also, in case the share price dropped in that year, Lau agreed to buy 60% of the shares back from Pao at $2.50. But then Pao realised, if the share price rose over $2.50 in the year, the price would stay fixed and he would not get the gains. So he demanded that instead of that, Lau would merely indemnify Pao if the share price fell below $2.50.

The data type employed was primary and secondary data. The secondary data source included primary, secondary and tertiary data. Techniques of collecting data used were interview and library study. Technique of analyzing data used was an interactive model of analysis, in which the data collected would be then analyzed using 3 (three) stages: data reduction, data display and conclusion drawing. Considering the result of research and discussion, it can be concluded that firstly, the Procedure of giving bank guarantee in the Surakarta main branch of PT Bank Negara Indonesia can be divided into 2 (two) types: bank guarantee giving with full cover collateral and bank guarantee giving with non-full cover collateral. Guarantee bank with full cover collateral means that the collateral {{is in the form of}} account. Meanwhile the guarantee bank with non-full cover guarantee means it is guaranteed with the customer’s account and asset as included in the <b>Guarantee</b> Bank Publication <b>Agreement</b> (PPGB).
