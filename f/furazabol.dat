5000|$|<b>Furazabol</b> ( [...] , [...] ) (brand name Miotalon), {{also known}} as androfurazanol, is a synthetic, orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid which has been marketed in Japan since 1969. It is a 17α-alkylated {{derivative}} of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) and is closely related structurally to stanozolol, differing from it only by having a furazan ring system instead of pyrazole. <b>Furazabol</b> has a relatively high ratio of anabolic to androgenic activity. As with other 17α-alkylated AAS, it may have a risk of hepatotoxicity. The drug {{has been described as}} an antihyperlipidemic and is claimed to be useful in the treatment of atherosclerosis and hypercholesterolemia, but according to William Llewellyn, such properties of <b>furazabol</b> are a myth.|$|E
50|$|Furazan, or 1,2,5-oxadiazole, is an heterocyclic {{aromatic}} {{organic compound}} {{consisting of a}} five-atom ring containing 1 oxygen and 2 nitrogen atoms. The furazan ring system {{is also found in}} the steroid <b>furazabol.</b> Furazan and its derivatives are obtained from the oxime derivatives of 1,2-diketones.|$|E
50|$|Androisoxazole (brand names Neo-Ponden, Neo-Pondus), {{also known}} as 17α-methyl-5α-androstano3,2-cisoxazol-17β-ol, is an orally active anabolic-androgenic steroid (AAS) and a 17α-alkylated {{derivative}} of dihydrotestosterone (DHT) that is marketed in Spain and Italy. It {{is closely related to}} stanozolol, differing only in having an isoxazole instead of pyrazole ring fused to the A ring, and is also related to <b>furazabol,</b> prostanozol, and danazol.|$|E
5000|$|Johnson's coach, Charlie Francis, a vocal {{critic of}} the IOC testing procedures, {{is the author of}} Speed Trap, which {{features}} Johnson heavily. In the book, he freely admits that his athletes were taking anabolic steroids, as he claims all top athletes at the time were, and also claims that Johnson could not possibly have tested positive for that particular steroid since Johnson actually preferred <b>furazabol.</b> He thought stanozolol made his body [...] "feel tight". The numerous athletes using performance-enhancing drugs at the time understood how long before a race, and possible drug test, they should stop using the drugs. Johnson later claimed that André A. Jackson, Lewis' Santa Monica Track Club teammate, who was inside the drug testing room in Seoul, may have placed the stanozolol in one of the beers Johnson drank in order to make urine for his test.|$|E
50|$|A famous case of AAS {{use in a}} {{competition}} was Canadian Ben Johnson's victory in the 100 m at the 1988 Summer Olympics. He subsequently failed the drug test when stanozolol was found in his urine. He later admitted to using the steroid as well as Dianabol, testosterone, <b>Furazabol,</b> and human growth hormone amongst other things. Johnson was stripped of his gold medal {{as well as his}} world-record performance. Carl Lewis was then promoted one place to take the Olympic gold title. Lewis had also run under the current world record time and was therefore recognized as the new record holder. In 2003, however, Wade Exum, the United States Olympic Committee (USOC) director of drug control administration from 1991 to 2000, gave copies of documents to Sports Illustrated which revealed that some 100 American athletes who failed drug tests and should have been prevented from competing in the Olympics were nevertheless cleared to compete; among those athletes was Carl Lewis.|$|E
40|$|<b>Furazabol,</b> a newer anabollc steroid, is metabolized into 16 -hydroxyfurazabol and {{excreted}} in urine. The {{presence of}} this compound in urine can be monitored with a GC/MS procedure. It can be Incorporated into the general dope testing protocol for anabolic steroids. Introduct ion <b>Furazabol</b> (17 -/ 3 -hydroxy- 17 -t~-methylandrostano [2, 3 -c]fura-zan) is an anabolic steroid first ynthesized in 1965 (l). In animal studies, it was shown to be more anabolic than androgenic (2). In subcutaneous administration, the myotrophic/androgenic ratio of <b>furazabol</b> {{was determined to be}} 5. 8, with testosterone propionate as the reference which has a ratio of 1. This com-pared favorably to stanozolol which has a ratio of 4. 0. Stano-zolol (17 -/ 3 -hydroxy- 17 -a-methylandrostano[2, 3 -c]pyrazole) has a structure very similar to that of <b>furazabol</b> (Figure 1) ...|$|E
