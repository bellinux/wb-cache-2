5|$|The Skyfleet S570 {{aircraft}} in the film was an ex-British Airways 747-200B G-BDXJ which had its engines removed and was modified for its appearance in the film. The modified aircraft had the outboard engines replaced by external fuel tanks, while the <b>inboard</b> engines were replaced by a mock-up pair of engines on each <b>inboard</b> pylon. The cockpit profile was altered to make the 747 look like a prototype of an advanced airliner. The plane used {{can be seen on}} the BBC motoring programme Top Gear on the Test Track.|$|E
5|$|Japan Airlines Flight 350, a DC-8, {{crashed in}} 1982 {{short of the}} runway in Tokyo, after the mentally ill captain {{attempted}} suicide during the final approach phase of the flight, by putting the <b>inboard</b> engines into reverse thrust. Of the 174 people aboard, 24 died.|$|E
5|$|CV-22B : U.S. Air Force variant for the U.S. Special Operations Command (USSOCOM). It conducts {{long-range}} {{special operations}} missions, and {{is equipped with}} extra wing fuel tanks, an AN/APQ-186 terrain-following radar, and other equipment such as the AN/ALQ-211, and AN/AAQ-24 Nemesis Directional Infrared Counter Measures. The fuel capacity is increased by 588 gallons (2,230 L) with two <b>inboard</b> wing tanks; three auxiliary tanks (200 or 430 gal) can also be added in the cabin. The CV-22 replaced the MH-53 Pave Low.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, the Singaporean Hunter fleet was {{upgraded}} and modified by Lockheed Aircraft Services Singapore (LASS) {{with an additional}} hardpoint under the forward fuselage and another two <b>inboard</b> pylons (wired only for AIM-9 Sidewinders) before the main gears, bringing {{to a total of}} seven hardpoints for external stores and weapons delivery. As a result of these upgrades, they were redesignated as FGA.74S, FR.74S and T.75S. The RSAF Black Knights, Singapore Air Force's aerobatic team, flew Hunters from 1973 until 1989.|$|E
5|$|The B.1 {{had four}} {{elevators}} (<b>inboard)</b> and four ailerons (outboard). In the B.2, these {{were replaced by}} eight elevons. The Vulcan was also fitted with six electrically operated three-position (in, medium drag, high drag) airbrakes, four in the upper centre section and two in the lower. There were originally four lower airbrakes but the outboard two were deleted before the aircraft entered service. A brake parachute was installed inside the tail cone.|$|E
5|$|The armor {{protection}} of the Gangut-class ships had to protect against two different threats as revealed during the Russo-Japanese War. Japanese high explosive shells had riddled the unarmored portions of Russian ships and had even sunk several ships with their heavy armor belts unpenetrated. The Russians decided that the entire {{side of the ship}} needed to be armored, even though this would limit the thickness of the main belt. They developed a system where the outer armor would break up or at least slow shells down and burst immediately behind the outer armor and an <b>inboard</b> armor bulkhead would stop the splinters and shell fragments from reaching the vitals. This system likely would have worked against the British armor-piercing shells that performed so badly at the Battle of Jutland, but would have failed against the improved shells introduced afterwards with their redesigned fuses. A related weakness was that the turrets and conning towers lacked the <b>inboard</b> splinter bulkhead even though they used armor thickness roughly equivalent to that of the main belt.|$|E
5|$|The rear-wheel {{steering}} was {{dropped from the}} production car to save weight and reduce complexity, as was the height adjustable suspension and active aerodynamic technology. The suspension fitted to the production model consisted of front and rear independent suspension, double unequal length wishbones, <b>inboard</b> coil springs and anti-roll bars, with Bilstein gas-filled dampers. The suspension was designed {{in accordance with the}} FIA Group C specifications.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{its high}} speeds, large forces {{were applied to}} the {{aircraft}} during banks and turns, and caused twisting and distortion of the aircraft's structure. In addition there were concerns over maintaining precise control at supersonic speeds. Both of these issues were resolved by active ratio changes between the <b>inboard</b> and outboard elevons, varying at differing speeds including supersonic. Only the innermost elevons, which {{are attached to the}} stiffest area of the wings, were active at high speed. Additionally, the narrow fuselage meant that the aircraft flexed. This was visible from the rear passengers' viewpoints.|$|E
5|$|In 1971 a Boeing 747, {{operating}} as Pan Am 845 struck approach light structures for the reciprocal runway as it lifted off the runway at San Francisco Airport. Major {{damage to the}} belly and landing gear resulted, which caused the loss of hydraulic fluid from three of its four flight control systems. The fluid which remained in the fourth system gave the captain very limited control {{of some of the}} spoilers, ailerons, and one <b>inboard</b> elevator. That was sufficient to circle the plane while fuel was dumped and then to make a hard landing. There were no fatalities, but there were some injuries.|$|E
5|$|In 1981, a Lockheed L-1011, {{operating}} as Eastern Airlines Flight 935, suffered a similar failure of its tail-mounted number two engine. The shrapnel from that engine inflicted damage {{on all four}} of its hydraulic systems, which were also close together in the tail structure. Fluid was lost {{in three of the}} four systems. The fourth hydraulic system was impacted with shrapnel, but not punctured. The hydraulic pressure remaining in that fourth system enabled the captain to land the plane safely with some limited use of the outboard spoilers, the <b>inboard</b> ailerons, and the horizontal stabilizer, plus differential engine power of the remaining two engines. There were no injuries.|$|E
5|$|Seven of {{the lines}} are {{operated}} by the Norwegian State Railways, owned by the Norwegian Ministry of Transport and Communications, while the Gjøvik Line is operated by the NSB-owned NSB Gjøvikbanen. The operating deficit is covered by the state for NSB's lines, while NSB Gjøvikbanen's routes are financed by a public service obligation. The trains have two sections, manned and unmanned. Validated ticket-holders can travel in the unmanned section, which have orange doors. Manned sections, with gray doors, have a conductor and allow passengers to purchase tickets. Tickets are available at ticket machines at stations; if bought <b>inboard,</b> there is a 20 Norwegian krone (NOK) surcharge.|$|E
5|$|As the {{additional}} main battery turrets with their associated magazines used {{a great amount}} of space within each already-limited ship, Capps was forced to economize in other ways to stay within the tonnage limit. Machinery had to be built smaller than normal to fit in the space between the fore and aft magazines, both of which were larger than usual. Boiler rooms were moved <b>inboard</b> to make room for torpedo protection. The biggest drawback was in propulsion: {{there was no room for}} engines that could provide the same amount of power as on previous battleships. Capps suggested cutting down the number of boilers by one-third to make room; it may have been at this point that he considered turbine propulsion, for which he would have needed extra room. All the Bureau of Engineering could offer in response was more compact boiler rooms by eliminating centerline bulkheads.|$|E
5|$|At {{almost the}} same time as Chesapeake lost control of her helm, her fore-topsail halyard was shot away, her fore-topsail yard then dropped, and she 'luffed up'. Losing her forward momentum, she yawed further into the wind until she was 'in irons', her sails were pressed back against her masts and she then made {{sternway}} (went backwards). Her port stern quarter (rear left corner) made contact with Shannons starboard side, level with the fifth gunport from the bow, and Chesapeake was caught by the projecting fluke of one of Shannons anchors, which had been stowed on the gangway. Chesapeakes spanker boom then swung over the deck of the British ship. Mr Stevens, Broke's boatswain, lashed the boom <b>inboard</b> to keep the two ships together, and lost an arm as he did so.|$|E
5|$|For , Rindt's {{partner at}} Lotus was John Miles; Graham Hill {{had left the}} team to drive for Rob Walker's {{customer}} franchise. Rindt became the clear team leader. At the first Grand Prix {{of the season in}} South Africa, he qualified fourth, but eventually retired with an engine failure after a first lap incident with Chris Amon and Jack Brabham, the latter of whom went on to win for the final time in his career. At the following race, the Spanish Grand Prix, Lotus introduced their revolutionary new car design. Instead of one conventional front radiator, the Lotus 72 featured two, one {{on each side of the}} cockpit. Further innovations included torsion bar suspension in place of the widely used coil-springs, and all four brakes mounted <b>inboard</b> to reduce unsprung weight. During its first practice session, the left semi-axle of the car broke, sending Rindt into a spin. The car also proved ineffective in the race; Rindt retired after nine laps.|$|E
5|$|Nevada {{became a}} prime target for Japanese Val dive bombers {{during the second}} wave. Japanese pilots {{intended}} to sink her in the channel ostensibly to block the harbor. Tactically target selection was wrong as 14–18 dive bombers attacking her wouldn't be able to sink a battleship with 250kg bombs and the channel's width of 1200 feet made the idea of bottling up the harbor impossible. As she steamed past Ten-Ten Dock at about 09:50, Nevada was struck by five bombs. One exploded over the crew's galley at Frame 80. Another struck the port director platform and exploded {{at the base of}} the stack on the upper deck. Yet another hit near No. 1 turret <b>inboard</b> from the port waterway and blew large holes in the upper and main decks. Two struck the forecastle near Frame 15; one passed out through the side of the second deck before exploding, but the other exploded within the ship near the gasoline tank; leakage and vapors from this tank caused intense fires around the ship.|$|E
5|$|The Do 217s trailed {{the fleet}} for some time, but the Italian fleet did not open fire upon {{sighting}} them; they were trailing the fleet {{at such a}} distance {{that it was impossible}} to identify them as Allied or Axis, and Bergamini believed that they were the air cover promised to them by the Allies. However, an attack upon Italia and Roma at 15:37 spurred the fleet into action, as the anti-aircraft batteries onboard opened fire and all ships began evasive maneuvers. About fifteen minutes after this, Italia was hit on the starboard side underneath her fore main turrets, while Roma was hit on the same side somewhere between frames 100 and 108. This bomb passed through the ship and exploded beneath the keel, damaging the hull girder and allowing water to flood the after engine room and two boiler rooms. The flooding caused the <b>inboard</b> propellers to stop for want of power and started a large amount of arcing, which itself caused many electrical fires in the aft half of the ship.|$|E
25|$|Many early {{implementations}} for automobiles {{located the}} brakes on the <b>inboard</b> side of the driveshaft, near the differential, while most brakes today are located inside the wheels. An <b>inboard</b> location reduces the unsprung weight and eliminates a source of heat transfer to the tires.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 all 2CV models got <b>inboard</b> front disc brakes.|$|E
25|$|Production variant with <b>inboard</b> underwing racks for drop tanks or 2000 lb of bombs, 527 built.|$|E
25|$|Failure of {{a single}} <b>inboard</b> engine, from a set of four, has a much smaller effect on controllability. This is because an <b>inboard</b> engine {{is closer to the}} aircraft's centre of gravity, so the lack of yawing moment is decreased. In this situation, if speed is {{maintained}} at or above the published VMCA, as determined for the critical engine, safe control can be maintained.|$|E
25|$|The Model 100 had {{an unusual}} <b>inboard</b> mounted twin engine {{arrangement}} driving forward mounted contra-rotating propellers through driveshafts.|$|E
25|$|Photos {{taken in}} 1986 by Woods Hole Alvin, {{released}} by Navy in 2012, shows the broken <b>inboard</b> {{end of the}} propulsion shaft.|$|E
25|$|A new trailing-edge {{high-lift}} device {{has been}} adopted with an advanced dropped-hinge flap {{similar to that of}} the Airbus A380, which permits the gap between the trailing edge and the flap to be closed with the spoiler. It is a limited morphing wing with adaptive features for continuously optimising the wing loading to reduce fuel burn: variable camber for longitudinal load control where <b>inboard</b> & outboard flaps deflect together and differential flaps setting for lateral load control where <b>inboard</b> & outboard flaps deflect differentially.|$|E
25|$|On April 26, 2013, a {{piece of}} the <b>inboard</b> wing flap {{mechanism}} from a Boeing 767 was discovered wedged between two buildings at Park Place.|$|E
25|$|The accident, at 10:01a.m. Singapore Standard Time (02:01 UTC), {{was caused}} by an {{uncontained}} failure of the port <b>inboard</b> (No.2) engine, while en route over Batam Island, Indonesia.|$|E
25|$|The {{centerline}} position code is {{zero for}} a compartment on the ship's centerline, odd numbers for compartments entirely to starboard of the centerline, {{and even for}} compartments entirely to port. For compartments sharing the same deck and forward frame, the first {{two parts of the}} code are identical, and the third part of the code is numbered outward from the centerline. For example, four main-deck compartments at frame 90 would be 1-90-1-L <b>inboard</b> and 1-90-3-L outboard on the starboard side of the ship and 1-90-2-L <b>inboard</b> and 1-90-4-L outboard on the port side.|$|E
25|$|By convention, {{the largest}} {{chainring}} is outboard and the smallest is <b>inboard.</b> Chainrings vary {{in size from}} as few as 20 teeth {{to as many as}} 60 and potentially more.|$|E
25|$|Model 170B, {{conversion}} of the remaining four JRM-1s re-engined with 2,400hp Wright R3350-24WA engines turning 16ft, 8in Curtiss-Electric props, of which the <b>inboard</b> two engines were fitted with reversible-pitch devices.|$|E
25|$|Several {{versions}} of the Spitfire, starting with the HF Mk VIIs had extra 13 gallon integral fuel tanks added to the wing leading edges between the wing-root and the <b>inboard</b> cannon bay.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydraulically}} operated main-wheel units {{were similar to}} those of the Lancaster, had single Dunlop wheels and retracted rearward into the <b>inboard</b> engine nacelles. The twin tailwheels retracted rearward into the fuselage and were enclosed by twin longitudinal doors.|$|E
25|$|Covenanter Mk III (Cruiser Mk V**) – new {{production}} with twin oil coolers installed {{either side of}} the engine. Clutch linkage modified. Air cleaners added <b>inboard</b> at the rear. Exhaust silencers moved {{to the ends of the}} track guards.|$|E
25|$|Air-droppable {{lifeboats}} {{included the}} EDO A-3 lifeboat with an <b>inboard</b> motor, fuel, water and food; or a Higgins airborne A-1 lifeboat; both required parachutes to slow their descent. As well, inflatable life rafts could be dropped without a parachute.|$|E
25|$|The 1967 French Citroën DS and 1970 Citroën SM were {{equipped}} with an elaborate dynamic headlamp positioning system that adjusted the <b>inboard</b> headlamps' horizontal and vertical position in response to inputs from the vehicle's steering and suspension systems.|$|E
25|$|On July 14, 2004, US Airways Express Flight 3504, an Embraer ERJ-145LR (N829HK) {{operated}} by Trans States Airlines, overran the runway and sustained minor {{damage to the}} <b>inboard</b> left main landing gear tire. There were no serious injuries.|$|E
25|$|The Technical Officer of the Board of Inquiry (BoI) {{identified}} a suspected fatigue {{failure of the}} <b>inboard</b> arm of the front bottom wing attachment main forging, and suggested vibration from the high airflow volumes required by the RR Conway 11 engines as a possible cause.|$|E
25|$|Both {{rear and}} front {{suspension}} were completely redesigned for the CSR. The front suspension has double wishbone, fully adjustable, <b>inboard</b> springs and dampers, improving aerodynamics. The rear suspension is also upgraded to a double wishbone, fully independent system, replacing the De Dion tube design.|$|E
