40|$|International audienceNearly 300 Millions {{of waste}} tires {{have to be}} managed in Europe. The main {{industrial}} ways to treat this kind of waste are incineration for energetic valorization and tires milling in chips or granulates for material valorization in construction industry. Steam water thermolysis (SWT) of tires, a hybrid of pyrolysis and solvolysis, is a good alternative to valorize waste tires. Recovered carbon black (rCB), which can be reintroduced in rubber industry as reinforcing filler (circular economy concept), is a more economical added value material than shredded tires. Physical and chemical characterizations on SWT-rCB were performed following ASTM analytical standards. A comparison between <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (N 330) and rCB from pyrolysis (commercial products) was carried out. Oil Absorption Number (ASTM D 2414) and nitrogen adsorption (ASTM D 6556) measurements demonstrate that rCBs structure and specific surface area are comparable to a <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> N 330. According to data issued from ASTM standards, the behavior of rCBs reinforcement in rubbers is then expected to be equivalent to a N 330 carbon black. Rubber compounds were produced with a homemade formula and mechanical characterizations were carried out {{in order to assess}} reinforcement properties of SWT-rCB. Comparisons in terms of mechanical properties have been established between rubbers reinforced with 100 % of SWT-rCB, rubbers reinforced with furnace carbon blacks (N 330, N 550 and N 772), and mixtures of SWT-rCB and furnace carbon blacks. The results clearly show that rCBs reinforcement properties are lower than those of N 330 carbon black. However, for a same rubber formula, SWT-rCB filled rubbers properties are close or slightly better than N 550 and N 772 filled rubbers...|$|E

Catalysts were prepared by acid-washing these ballmilled carbon supports, then impregnating them with iron(II) acetate and pyrolyzing in NH 3 at 950 °C. It {{was found that}} ballmilling the carbon support improved the ORR activity for catalysts made with Black Pearls 2000 (Cabot), but decreased it for those made with N 650 and left it relatively unchanged for those made with N 234 (both low surface area commercial <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> from Sid Richardson Carbon Corporation). For catalysts made with ballmilled Black Pearls 2000, {{it was found that}} ORR activity increases as i) degree of disorder increases, ii) the change in micropore surface area due to pyrolysis increases, iii) nitrogen content increases and iv) crystallite size (La) approaches 24 Å. No compelling trends were found for catalysts made with ballmilled N 234 and N 650. Interestingly, despite the wide ranging catalytic activities of catalysts produced from these <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> without ballmilling, almost identical activity for ORR is obtained when the <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> are ballmilled for 2 hours prior to acid-washing, FeAc impregnation and pyrolysis...|$|R

It was also possible to show that certain <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> contain intrinsic microporosity which is more difficult to unambiguously detect by adsorption of N 2 at 77 K.

40|$|Due to {{the demand}} for higher {{production}} capacity and natural-gas energy savings, improvements {{were made to the}} rotary dryers in the drying process of wet pelletized oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks.</b> Since the rotary dryers were originally designed for drying semi-wet pelletized oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks,</b> they did not entirely satisfy optimal conditions for drying wet pelletized oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks.</b> Figure 1 shows the drying principle with key dimensions. The energy for drying the wet pelletized oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> was provided by natural gas combustion in an open-furnace system with an uncontrolled feed of combustion air. Improvements on the rotary dryers were carried out by adjusting the excess oxygen in the gases passing through the butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack. By regulating the butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack, and applying the prescribed operations for drying wet pelletized oil <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks,</b> the excess oxygen in the tail gases was adjusted in the range of φ = 3. 0 % and 5. 0 %, {{depending on the type of}} oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks.</b> Suggested also is installation of a direct-reverse automatic butterfly valve on the dryer exhaust stack to automatically determine the volume fraction of oxygen in the tail gas, and the volume flow rate of natural gas for combustion. The results the improvements carried out are shown in Tables 3 to 5. Table 2 shows the thermal calculations for the hood of the rotary dryer. Preheating of the process water in the temperature range of 70 °C and 80 °C is also recommended using the net heat from the oil-furnace process for wet pelletization. The results of preheating the process water are shown in Table 1. Depending on the type of oil-furnace <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> the aforementioned improvements resulted in natural gas energy savings ranging from 25 % to 35 % in relation to the average natural gas requirement in the drying process, and thus a reduction in carbon emissions of up to 40 %, which is shown in Table 6.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated “hydrogen spillover” {{which has}} been suggested to improve the hydrogen uptake of bridged and chemically doped porous materials at room temperatures. XRD, Temperature Programmed Desorption and hydrogen sorption measurements were used to characterise the as-received and palladium doped porous materials. The hydrogen uptakes of as-received Maxsorb (activated <b>carbon),</b> <b>Black</b> Pearls (<b>carbon</b> <b>furnace</b> <b>black)</b> and MOF- 5 (metal organic framework) were all very low (< 0. 16 wt. %) at room temperature and 16 bar. Bridging the Black Pearls and Maxsorb carbon samples with 5 wt. % Pd/C resulted in fractionally higher hydrogen uptakes (0. 01 wt. %). These results bore a closer resemblance to a physical mixture of Pd and carbon which suggested that the bridges had not been formed and spillover was not occurring. A higher wt. % Pd chemically doped carbon showed an initial rapid hydrogen uptake (0. 03 wt. % at < 1 bar) followed by a shallower near linear uptake above this pressure. The hydrogen uptake seemed more consistent with palladium and carbon sorbing independently, rather than hydrogen spilling over from palladium to carbon giving enhanced uptake. However, good contact between Pd and carbon must be established and the result must be replicated to confirm its validity {{in the face of}} much contrary literature...|$|R
40|$|Aiming {{to develop}} acrylonitrile–butadiene– styrene (ABS) {{composites}} with enhanced ultraviolet stability, {{a series of}} formulations were prepared by melt compounding and evaluated by different characterization techniques. The influence of rutile titanium dioxide (TiO 2) and its combination with <b>furnace</b> <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (CB) on the viscoelastic properties of neat ABS was studied by dynamic mechanical analysis. An increase in the glass transition (Tg) dynamics ascribed to the rubbery phase {{as a function of}} exposure time was observed. A greater contribution of CB nanoparticles in combination with TiO 2 to minimize the modifications on the Tg of the butadienic component was clearly seen. Quasi-static and spectrophotometry results are in good agreement, showing the efficiency of TiO 2 submicron particles and CB/TiO 2 against photo-oxidative degradation of neat ABS. A different behaviour was observed for modified ABS/TiO 2 and ABS/ CB/TiO 2 composites with light stabilizers, antioxidants and combinations of them. While the TiO 2 efficiency was enhanced by the incorporation of combinations of light stabilizers and antioxidants, poor results were observed for modified ABS/CB/TiO 2 composites as a consequence of antagonistic interactions. It was concluded that formulations of ABS/CB/TiO 2 with light stabilizers and ultraviolet absorbers are unacceptable for common applications...|$|E

It {{was found that the}} permittivity " 0 and dielectric loss " 00 increased by increasing HAF content. This increase is slightly lowered by the addition of Mg(OH) 2. The electrical conductivity of HAF-epoxy composites increased from the pure polymer towards that of pure carbon. A low frequency region with relaxation time 1 in the range 3. 5 – 4. 5 104 s is found to be unaffected by either filler content or the presence of Mg(OH) 2. The higher frequency range with relaxation time 2 is nearly the same for lower concentrations of HAF up to 10 wt % (percolation threshold concentration). Above this concentration a dramatic increase was noticed. Incorporation of 10 wt % of HAF led to an increase in the compressive strength value. Further increase in HAF content resulted in a decrease in compressive strength values. The tensile strength values of the composite samples before and after the addition of 10 wt % Mg(OH) 2 are higher than that of the unloaded one. The addition of 10 wt % Mg(OH) 2 improved both the thermal stability and the fire retardant efficiency of HAF–epoxy composites...|$|E

The influences of various carbon materials on the properties of cast iron melt were investigated by examining the micro-structure and the average carbon contents of samples obtained. In the case of electrode graphite, although carburizing into solid iron was very difficult, the dispersion of graphite into liquid iron occured easily and thus the electrode graphite promoted the nucleation and growth of stable graphite-γ eutectic. In the case of non-graphitizing carbon materials, although carburizing into solid and liquid iron was easier with a decrease in the degree of graphitization, and the dispersion of carbon matelials into liquid iron were promoted with an increase in the degree of graphitization. The nucleation and growth of graphite-γ eutectic were more difficult with a decrease in the degree of graphitization, while those of the metastable cementite-γ eutectic were promoted. Though carbon content in the melts at 1873 K hardly changed for all carbon meterials, their behavior to the iron differed remarkably by the sort of carbon precursor and graphitization temperature of carbon materials. These facts indicate clearly that the properties of carburized melt (the state of the presence of carbon-microgroups) depend on the structural characteristics of carbon materials...|$|R

40|$|Polymer nanocomposites {{represent}} {{a class of}} advanced, multifunctional materials, combining the attractive features of both nanomaterials and polymers. The level of dispersion of the nanoparticles directly controls {{the extent to which}} nanocomposites can maximize the unique attributes of their nano-scale fillers. However, {{as a consequence of the}} tendency of nanofillers to agglomerate, the anticipated superior properties of polymer nanocomposites are yet to be realised, and remain merely a theoretical prediction. As a result, the surface chemistry of nanofillers is often tailored to reduce the attractive interparticle interactions that promote agglomeration. This modification can also be used to enhance the interfacial interactions between the nanofiller and polymer matrices to achieve improved filler dispersion. Accordingly, this thesis addresses this challenge in nanocomposite technology by investigating the chemical surface functionalisation of various nanoparticles in order to produce polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites with superior electrical, mechanical and thermal properties. Part I describes covalent modification of nanosilica, microsilica, <b>furnace</b> <b>Carbon</b> <b>Black</b> (CB), acetylene black (ACB) and carbon nanotube (CNT) nanomaterials by carbene insertion and azo-coupling reactions, in a series of studies, in order to tailor their surfaces for application in polypropylene (PP) nanocomposites. The surface characterisation of the modified nanomaterials was assessed in detail using XPS, CHN, SSNMR, BET, ATR-IR and thermal analysis techniques. The surface grafting densities were estimated to be of the order of 10 13 and 10 14 molecules/cm 2 and additionally, SSNMR provided direct evidence of the diarylcarbene reaction to the silica surface. Following nanocomposite production with PP by solvent mixing methods, the macroscopic properties were studied demonstrating altered electrical, mechanical and thermal properties following assessment of the DC conductivity, dielectric properties, thermal analysis (TGA, DSC, DMA) and morphological measurements. In particular, the introduction to the CB surface of a diaryl complex with terminal dodecyl hydrocarbon chains demonstrated substantial improvements to the DC electrical and dielectric properties of the PP nanocomposites. Part II explores the non-covalent surface functionalisation of CB and ACB by the physisorption of the non-ionic surfactant Triton-X- 100. Various protocols were developed in which an optimal surface loading for CB was determined by treatment at 0. 024 mM(aq). In addition, the modification procedure was combined with the granulation protocol of ACB in an effort to evaluate the potential for industrial applications. The degree of surface functionalisation was extensively characterised by BET, XPS, thermal analysis, UV-Vis and ATR-IR analyses. PP nanocomposites produced by solvent and melt mixing methods demonstrated similar conductive properties following the nanoscale modification, however morphological, dielectric and thermal analysis indicated altered interfacial interactions demonstrating improved mechanical properties. </p...|$|E

In the solution-based case, fully solvated polymer results in a random dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> The segregated network composite also shows significant improvement in both electrical conductivity and storage modulus with low <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading, while the solution-based composite achieves significant property enhancements at higher <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> loading because of the greater percolation threshold. The effect of clay in both emulsion and solution-based composites with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was also studied by preparing composites with three clay concentrations (0. 2, 0. 4 and 2 wt%). In emulsion-based composites, low clay concentration reduced the percolation threshold from 1. 2 vol% to 0. 8 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> but with solution-based composites clay increased the percolation threshold from 8. 2 vol% to 11. 7 vol% <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> It is assumed that clay helps to force the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles into the conductive pathways in the emulsion-based composites. In solution-base composites, clay improves the dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black,</b> thereby destroying the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> network and reducing conductivity and storage modulus. The storage modulus in emulsion-based composites improved with 0. 2 wt% clay but greater clay concentration resulted in a drop in modulus due to porosity from excess excluded volume effects...|$|R

The thermal control coatings {{are exposed to}} electrostatic charges that develop on the external surface of the spacecraft. The charges would otherwise accumulate to cause arcing and possible damage. The <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> pigment provides sufficient electrical conductivity to dissipate electrostatic charges. In this study, The influence of the type and percent of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> on the surface resistivity of the coating produced by polydimethylsiloxane and <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> was studied. Results indicated that the weight fraction of the pigment in coatings fabricated by <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> with a sponge-like structure are lower compared to coatings fabricated by <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> with a nonporous structure also, the surface resistance decreased with increasing pigment contents...|$|R

(1969) such as polyethylene. Their high efficiency as light stabilizers is probably due {{to their ability to}} act as inner filters for UV radiation, and as radical scavengers, because many of the <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> contain stable radicals Szwarc (1956), and quenchers of singlet and triplet states of polymers. The effectiveness of <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks</b> is dependent upon Williams et al.

40|$|We {{have used}} {{positron}} annihilation Doppler broadening spectroscopy {{to investigate the}} effects of filling various rubber polymers with different amounts and types of <b>carbon</b> <b>blacks.</b> The results show direct correlation between various physical properties of the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and the Doppler broadening of the positron annihilation gamma ray. The Doppler broadening {{is characterized by the}} S parameter, which {{is a measure of the}} fraction of the positrons that annihilate with low-momentum valence electrons or from positronium in the sample. The S parameter decreases as <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> is added to the rubber. The decrease in the S parameter depends on the type and morphology of the <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> This is due to (1) reduction in positronium formation as <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> is added to the rubber, and (2) positron trapping at the carbon black–rubber interface, which depends on the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> morphology. The S parameter decreases with the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface area. The S parameter does not depend on the sample mixing time. PublishedN/...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> {{has been}} used as the main {{reinforcing}} fillers that increase the usefulness of rubbers. In this experiment, different compounds based on natural rubber were prepared with <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> (N 330) at various loading ratios from 10 to 125 phr. The mechanical and thermal properties of rubber compounds were measured and the test data with SEM micrographs were analyzed to determine the suitable ratio of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> for the desired properties of rubber compound. The results showed that <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> particles were well dispersed in compounds with loading ratios of 25 - 30 phr, corresponding to maximum tensile strength values. While with the increase of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> content, heat conductivity kept sustained increase. Fractal dimension characterized the degree of uneven dispersion of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> in rubber fracture surfaces. A particular value of fractal dimension was obtained to characterize the optimum mechanical property of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> filled natural rubber. The thermal property and fractal dimension demonstrated same variation tendency...|$|R

We show that <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> extracted from the grey chalk and Fish Clay has a carbon isotope value significantly different both from the underlying Upper Cretaceous <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> and from that of Upper Cretaceous charcoal. <b>Carbon</b> <b>black</b> stained bryozoan skeletons in the grey chalk are often seen to encrust on non-stained bryozoan skeletons and vice versa in the same stratigraphic level. This indicates that <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> deposition took place in pulses during the ca. 50, 000 year long grey chalk time interval. The carbon black-stained bryozoan skeletons {{are found to be}} rich in Ir as well as in other elements, and we demonstrate that the Ir-carrying phase is not a silicate, but rather the <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> itself.

40|$|Surface {{modification}} can {{be performed}} by adsorption of certain organic compounds {{on the surface of}} carbon. The main objective of this work was to compare the adsorption ability of acid-modified <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> with the non-modified one. Modification process was performed by adsorption of acetic acid onto commercial <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface. A batch adsorption system was applied to study the both adsorption reaction, acetic acid and Ni(II) adsorption onto the <b>carbon</b> <b>black.</b> Adsorption isotherms of acetic acid and Ni(II) adsorption onto the non-modified and modified <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> were fitted by classical adsorption models, such as Freundlich and Langmuir models. Modified <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> surface become more active for Ni(II) ions removal from aqueous solutions. The results showed that modification by acetic acid increases the adsorption capacity of <b>carbon</b> <b>black</b> from 18. 3823 mg Ni(II) g- 1 to 86. 9566 mg Ni(II) g- 1.
