5|$|Its role {{expanded}} in 2000, when Alamogordo passed an Economic Development Gross Receipts Tax. OCEDC {{continues to work}} to attract businesses, but now <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> develop the incentive packages that will be paid by the new tax, and {{a portion of the}} tax receipts go to fund OCEDC's operating expenses.|$|E
5|$|A {{major reason}} for this is economy. A single wooden tablet {{presented}} a limited space for writing, so it was in the interest of scribes to transcribe information efficiently, while still maintaining legibility and aesthetic quality. The ‘grafting’ system described above achieves this in an elegant manner. Another reason may be secrecy. Assuming that literacy was restricted to elites and professional navigators, it was in their interest to prevent their notation from being read too easily. This may explain why a given star can be represented by multiple glyphs. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> explain the combination system outlined above -- while basic characters can be read without difficulty, one would have to master the entire set of basic characters before recognizing the components of combined glyphs. In this way, the meaning would be opaque to anyone without proper training.|$|E
5|$|In 2013, the {{government}} adopted a National Export Strategy to diversify the country’s exports. Production facilities {{are to be}} established {{for a wide range}} of products within the three selected clusters: oil seed products, sugar cane products and manufacturing. The government estimates that these three clusters have the potential to represent more than 50% of Malawi’s exports by 2027. In order to help companies adopt innovative practices and technologies, the strategy makes provision for greater access to the outcome of international research and better information about available technologies; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> companies to obtain grants to invest in such technologies from sources such as the country’s Export Development Fund and the Malawi Innovation Challenge Fund.|$|E

50|$|The {{film was}} a box-office hit, {{and ran for}} more than 90 days. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> Kunchako Boban to {{position}} himself in Mollywood.|$|R
5|$|The Volt {{features}} OnStar Mobile {{application for}} owners to access vehicle information without being {{in or near}} the car. This smartphone application features the ability to check fuel efficiency as well as the vehicle's current electric range. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> monitor the charging, giving owners key information about the current charge level and the amount of time it will take until it is fully charged. The application also is able to control features such as locking/unlocking doors, and acts as a remote starter. A five-year OnStar Directions and Connections service was bundled into the 2011 Volt's base price, which was reduced to three years for the 2012 model year.|$|E
5|$|With 4...Bb4+ 5.Nbd2 d6 (see diagram at right) Black {{wants to}} open the {{diagonal}} a1–h8 for his queen. After 6.exd6 Qf6 White can react to the attack on his Bf4 in several ways, the best one being 7.Nh3 to develop a piece and protect both the Bf4 and the f2-pawn. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> that the Bf4 is still guarding the Nd2, so that after 7...Qxb2? {{there is not the}} threat of winning the exchange (8...Bxd2+ would be answered by 9.Bxd2) and White can repel Black's attack with 8.Rb1 Qa3 9.Rb3 Qa5 10.dxc7 Nc6 11.a3! Be7 12.e3. Instead, Black must play energetically with 7...Nxf2 8.Kxf2 Bxh3 9.g3 Bxf1 10.dxc7!? Nc6 11.Rxf1 and here Lalic recommends 11...0-0 12.Kg2 Rfe8.|$|E

50|$|<b>It</b> <b>also</b> {{featured}} specialist children's programming from Australia and overseas. Working {{closely with}} the Education Department and curriculum advisers in each state, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> create special programming to help students with their courses.|$|R
25|$|Alumni-institute {{interaction}} is maintained through the Alumni Network {{under the aegis}} of the Dean of Alumni Affairs and International Relations, his office staff and student representatives. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> in conducting the annual alumni meets.|$|E
25|$|Since the 2000s {{cosmetic}} compositions containing taurine {{have been}} introduced, possibly {{due to its}} antifibrotic properties. It {{has been shown to}} prevent the damaging effects of TGFB1 to hair follicles. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> to maintain skin hydration.|$|E
25|$|Women suffer {{less from}} heart disease due to vasculo-protective action of {{estrogen}} which helps in preventing atherosclerosis. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> in maintaining the delicate balance between fighting infections and protecting arteries from damage thus lowering the risk of cardiovascular disease.|$|E
30|$|Dr. Paige speaks both English and Farsi {{with native}} fluency. This aided with {{translation}} and avoiding cultural mistrust issues. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> us secure endorsements and collaborative efforts from Iranian-American organizations.|$|R
50|$|Amalka Supercomputing {{facility}} {{is credited with}} computing the first kinetic magnetic field model of Mercury in the MESSENGER project. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> to understand {{the results from the}} Cluster II mission.|$|R

25|$|The Science and Technology Park aims {{to bridge}} the gap between the academical-scientific world and private business, to use the {{university}} research potential in cooperation with private companies. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> starting entrepreneurs through its Business Incubator. Special attention is paid to fields of nanotechnology, biotechnology and information technology. It also manages the catalogue of University apparatus and services to make it accessible to private companies.|$|E
25|$|Maturing {{can also}} be done in barrels. The wine is put in barrels after {{fermentation}} but fermentation itself may also occur in the barrel. The barrel has a dual role: it flavours the wine giving it a scent of toast, butter, and vanilla but <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> to mature it by providing a very small regular quantity of oxygen through the wooden walls. This oxygen helps to polymerize {{the components of the}} wine making it less aggressive and more balanced.|$|E
25|$|Methylcyclopentadienyl {{manganese}} tricarbonyl (MMT) {{is used in}} Canada and in Australia {{to boost}} octane. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> old cars designed for leaded fuel run on unleaded fuel without need for additives to prevent valve problems. Its use in the US has been restricted by regulations. Its use in the EU is restricted by Article 8a of the Fuel Quality Directive following its testing under the Protocol {{for the evaluation of}} effects of metallic fuel-additives on the emissions performance of vehicles.|$|E
50|$|Simula was {{influential}} {{in the development of}} Smalltalk and later object-oriented programming languages. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> inspire the actor model of concurrent computation although Simula only supports co-routines and not true concurrency.|$|R
50|$|The tragedy was {{a factor}} in the {{decision}} by Congress in 1964 to terminate the bracero program, despite its strong support among farmers. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> spur the Chicano civil rights movement.|$|R
50|$|A-buffer help {{in using}} {{visibility}} techniques and support all conceivable geometric modeling primitives: polygons, patches, quadrics, fractals, and so forth. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>help</b> to handle transparency and intersecting surfaces (and transparent intersecting surfaces).|$|R
25|$|Both the {{attractive}} and repellent pheromones are utilized {{in the decision-making}} an ant must make while foraging. The repellent pheromone is especially useful in the repositioning of trails after a new food source has been introduced. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> prevent ants from concentrating on an undesirable trail. Thus, the repellant pheromone makes the pharaoh ant a particularly efficient forager. Despite their extreme importance, there is an adaptive value to using pheromones sparingly, as it streamlines communication during important decision-making situations, such as a nest migration.|$|E
25|$|Zinc {{is needed}} to {{maintain}} normal vitamin A levels in blood plasma. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> vitamin A become metabolized by the liver. However evidence suggests that when someone is deficient in both vitamin A and zinc, memory is more improved when just vitamin A is increased than when just zinc is increased. Of course memory has the largest improvement when both are increased. When one of these nutrients is not balanced, the other {{is most likely to}} be affected because they rely on each other for proper functioning in learning.|$|E
25|$|A {{disadvantage}} of the inductor is that current is shifted {{out of phase}} with the voltage, producing a poor power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In ballasts that control two or more lamps, line-frequency ballasts commonly use different phase relationships between the multiple lamps. This not only mitigates the flicker of the individual lamps, <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> maintain a high power factor. These ballasts are often called lead-lag ballasts because the current in one lamp leads the mains phase and the current in the other lamp lags the mains phase.|$|E
50|$|The Air Jordan XX {{was also}} {{inspired}} by bicycling shoes. The strap {{was placed in}} the center of the shoe over the laces. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> to create a tighter fit and increased support.|$|R
2500|$|Some uses of RDF include {{research}} into social networking. <b>It</b> will <b>also</b> <b>help</b> people in business fields understand better {{their relationships with}} members of industries that could be of use for product placement.

50|$|In 2005, {{it worked}} with other {{partners}} in Afghanistan to provide education {{for children who}} had been unable to attend school. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> HIV/AIDS education in Sierra Leone. and with schools in East Timor.|$|R
25|$|The school trains the {{air force}} pilots {{according}} {{to the needs of}} the trainees and according to the school's capabilities, taking into consideration the ongoing technological and military advancements. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> the army officers, who were transferred from the military academy for this purpose, by technically preparing them to fly jet planes and helicopters and giving them courses in air and ground tactics. The school gives other minor courses including foreign language courses in order to keep a high educational standard between their trainees. Pilots are always trained by the school, in compliance with the missions given forth by the colleges and schools of the Lebanese army.|$|E
25|$|Another {{hypothesis}} {{builds on}} the flood basalt eruption theory. An increase in temperature of five degrees Celsius {{would not be enough}} to explain the death of 95% of life. But such warming could slowly raise ocean temperatures until frozen methane reservoirs below the ocean floor near coastlines melted, expelling enough methane (among the most potent greenhouse gases) into the atmosphere to raise world temperatures an additional five degrees Celsius. The frozen methane hypothesis helps explain the increase in carbon-12 levels found midway in the Permian–Triassic boundary layer. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> explain why {{the first phase of the}} layer's extinctions was land-based, the second was marine-based (and starting right after the increase in C-12 levels), and the third land-based again.|$|E
25|$|Snow leopards show several adaptations {{for living}} in a cold, mountainous environment. Their bodies are stocky, their fur is thick, and their ears are small and rounded, all of which help to {{minimize}} heat loss. Their paws are wide, which distributes their weight better for walking on snow, and have fur on their undersides to increase their grip on steep and unstable surfaces; <b>it</b> <b>also</b> <b>helps</b> to minimize heat loss. Snow leopards' tails are long and flexible, helping them to maintain their balance, which {{is very important in}} the rocky terrain they inhabit. Their tails are also very thick due to fat storage and are very thickly covered with fur, which allows them to be used like a blanket to protect their faces when asleep.|$|E
25|$|The Sketch Book, {{along with}} James Fenimore Cooper's Leatherstocking Tales, was among first widely read works of American {{literature}} in Britain and Europe. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> advance {{the reputation of}} American writers with an international audience.|$|R
5000|$|The Hotel Baker {{is listed}} on the National Record of Historic Places. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> earn St. Charles the title of [...] "1 Great Place in Illinois" [...] and the Great American Main Street Award in 2000.|$|R
5000|$|They {{had higher}} and wider gun decks than {{preceding}} designs. This gave the gun crews more space to work in, improving efficiency. <b>It</b> <b>also</b> <b>helped</b> their sailing performance, {{because they were}} carrying fewer guns for their size.|$|R
