500|$|Although it {{enjoyed a}} degree of {{commercial}} success, the album received mixed reviews. Melody Maker deemed it [...] "a milestone {{in the history of}} awfulness", and the NMEs Richard Cook wrote: [...] "Like the poor damned Tommies that haunt his mind, Roger Waters' writing has been blown to hell... Waters stopped with The Wall, and The Final Cut isolates and juggles the identical themes of that elephantine concept with no fresh momentum to drive them." [...] Robert Christgau opined: [...] "it's a comfort to encounter antiwar rock that has the weight of years of self-pity behind it", and awarded the album a C+ grade. [...] More impressed, Rolling Stones Kurt Loder viewed it as [...] "essentially a Roger Waters solo album... a superlative achievement on several levels". [...] Dan Hedges of Record also approved, writing: [...] "On paper it sounds hackneyed and contrived – {{the sort of thing that}} was worked into the ground by everyone from P. F. Sloan to Paul Kantner. In Pink Floyd's case, it still works, partially through the understatement and ingenuity of the music and the special effects... but mostly through the care Waters <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> plotting out the imagery of his bleak visions." ...|$|E

2500|$|Aragorn {{marched on}} the Black Gate of Mordor with 7,000 men, knowing this force {{was far too}} small to {{actually}} defeat Sauron, but intending to cause a diversion to draw Sauron's armies away while Frodo and Sam journeyed to Mount Doom. After a brief encounter with the Mouth of Sauron, the battle was joined and went very poorly for the outnumbered Gondor/Rohan armies. Now wrongly convinced that Aragorn had the Ring, Sauron apparently reacted just as Gandalf had thought he would: [...] "I will crush him, and what he <b>has</b> <b>taken</b> <b>in</b> his insolence shall be mine again for ever." ...|$|E

Also restricted are public performances by women: Aside from Quran recitals, such performances are completely banned if any men are in the audience. While PAS has maintained that these steps were essential to promote Islam {{and put an end to}} immoral behaviour among the Muslim population, many consider them an act of defiance against Barisan Nasional's laws [...] which are more tolerant or laxer, depending on one's viewpoint [...] and also a major loss to Malay traditional arts.|$|E
