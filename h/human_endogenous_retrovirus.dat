40|$|Only {{few of the}} <b>human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> (HERV) {{sequences}} in {{the human}} genome can produce proteins. We have previously reported that (i) patients with germ cell tumors often make antibodies against proteins encoded by HERV-K elements, (ii) expression of the HERV-K rec gene in transgenic mice can interfere with germ cell development and induce carcinoma in situ, and (iii) HERV-K np 9 transcript is overproduced in many tumors including breast cancers. Here we document that both Np 9 and Rec physically and functionally interact with the promyelocytic leukemia zinc finger (PLZF) tumor suppressor, a transcriptional repressor and chromatin remodeler implicated in cancer and the self-renewal of spermatogonial stem cells. Interaction is mediated via two different central and C-terminal domains of Np 9 and Rec and the C-terminal zinc fingers of PLZF. One major target of PLZF is the c-myc proto-oncogene. Coexpression of Np 9 and Rec with PLZF abrogates the transcriptional repression of the c-myc gene promoter by PLZF and results in c-Myc overproduction, altered expression of c-Myc-regulated genes, and corresponding effects on cell proliferation and survival. Thus, the <b>human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> proteins Np 9 and Rec may act oncogenically by derepressing c-myc through the inhibition of PLZF...|$|E

40|$|In {{addition}} to the coding sequences, the human genome contains a so noncoding DNA, among which we count transposable elements capable of transposition in the genome. The remnants of the past <b>retrovirus</b> infections - <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> (<b>human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> - HERVs) belong to the transposable elements, which contain the LTR sequences. <b>Human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retroviruses</b> make up to 8 % {{of the size of}} the human genome. The retroviruses are not only passive relicts, but they have gained some key functions - too. They increase the plasticity of the human genome and some HERV LTRs can serve as binding sites for transcription factors like. Env protein from the families HERV-W and HERV- FRD were coopted by the human genome and are nowadays expressed as proteins Syncitin- 1 and Syncitin- 2, which are necessary by the forming of human placenta. Unfortunately, the HERV elements can have a negative health impacts. In the last decades they are subject of a debate in connection with various diseases, such as multiple sclerosis, schizophrenia, HIV proliferation and some types of tumorigenesis. The role of HERVs in the human genome is not completely known yet and it is important to continue with their research. Powered by TCPDF (www. tcpdf. org...|$|R

40|$|Syncytin is a fusogenic protein {{involved}} {{in the formation of}} the placental syncytiotrophoblast layer. This protein is encoded by the envelope gene of the ERVWE 1 proviral locus belonging to the <b>human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> W (HERV-W) family. The HERV-W infectious ancestor entered the primate lineage 25 to 40 million years ago. Although the syncytin fusion property has been clearly demonstrated, little is known about this cellular protein maturation process with respect to classical infectious retrovirus envelope proteins. Here we show that the cellular syncytin protein is synthesized as a glycosylated gPr 73 precursor cleaved into two mature proteins, a gp 50 surface subunit (SU) and a gp 24 transmembrane subunit (TM). These SU and TM subunits are found associated as homotrimers. The intracytoplasmic tail is critical to the fusogenic phenotype, although its cleavage requirements seem to have diverged from those of classical retroviral maturation. The <b>human</b> <b>endogenous</b> <b>retrovirus</b> W (HERV-W) family is derived from an infectious retroviral element which entered the germ line 25 to 40 million years ago (5, 48).
