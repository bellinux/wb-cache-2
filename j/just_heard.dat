5|$|It's {{definitely}} riskier {{than something}} a bit more... simple. I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> {{the track and}} loved {{that it was so}} different: it felt a bit African, a bit electronic and futuristic. It reminded me of what I love, which is mixing different cultures and eras — things that typically don't go together — to create a new sound. I can never be safe; I always try and go against the grain. As soon as I accomplish one thing, I just set a higher goal. That's how I've gotten to where I am.|$|E
5|$|Mozart had a pet common {{starling}} {{which could}} sing {{part of his}} Piano Concerto in G Major (KV. 453). He had bought it from a shop after hearing it sing a phrase from a work he wrote six weeks previously, which {{had not yet been}} performed in public. He became very attached to the bird and arranged an elaborate funeral for it when it died three years later. It has been suggested that his A Musical Joke (K. 522) might be written in the comical, inconsequential style of a starling's vocalisation. Other people who have owned common starlings report how adept they are at picking up phrases and expressions. The words have no meaning for the starling, so they often mix them up or use them on what to humans are inappropriate occasions in their songs. Their ability at mimicry is so great that strangers have looked in vain for the human they think they have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> speak.|$|E

25|$|As {{they walk}} {{out into the}} countryside, Socrates tries to {{convince}} Phaedrus to repeat the speech of Lysias which he has <b>just</b> <b>heard.</b> Phaedrus makes several excuses, but Socrates suspects strongly that Phaedrus has {{a copy of the}} speech with him. Saying that while Lysias is present, he would never allow himself {{to be used as a}} training partner for Phaedrus to practice his own speech-making on, he asks Phaedrus to expose what he is holding under his cloak. Phaedrus gives in and agrees to perform Lysias' speech.|$|E
25|$|That night Curtin {{received}} a call from MacArthur, who had <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> about Eather's withdrawal to Imita Ridge. MacArthur told Curtin to send Blamey back to Papua to take personal command of New Guinea Force. Curtin did so, and Blamey arrived in Port Moresby on 23 September. This put Rowell and Blamey on a collision course. They had a history of animosity going back to earlier in the war, first in the Middle East then in Greece. Rowell felt that Blamey should have supported him and stood up to Curtin and MacArthur. Relations were fractious, and on 28 September Rowell had had enough. He spoke his mind to his commanding officer, and was dismissed. Potts had just lost his major advocate in Papua.|$|E

500|$|A {{few days}} earlier I'd <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> of the tragic death of my colleague...

This sanctuary, undoubtedly the oldest in France... had everything to captivate me... The same evening of this visit to Rocamadour, I began my Litanies à la Vierge noire for female voices and organ.

500|$|A fifth {{movie was}} written, {{and may have}} been produced, but it was never released. Frankie Thomas {{believes}} that he and Granville made five films, not four, and in August 1939 Harriet Adams wrote to Mildred Benson, [...] "three have been shown in this area, and I have <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> that a fifth is in production." [...] The cancellation of the series was a result of Bonita Granville and Glenda Farrell both leaving the studio (Granville going to MGM and Farrell returning to the stage), Warner Bros. deciding to discontinue both series after the final Torchy Blane film (with Jane Wyman replacing Farrell) flopped, and the onset of World War II.|$|E

We'd fill in the blanks as far as making them full records. From having live horns, live strings, live drummers. This percussion dude, he was coming in with bottles, banging on bottles, just sprinkles of shit. We went all out. We brought in musicians to bring it out. Jay probably <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> a sample and some drums. Once we got the vocals back, we brought in all the extra candy".|$|E
500|$|English {{rock group}} the Yardbirds {{recorded}} [...] "The Train Kept A-Rollin'" [...] {{during their first}} American tour in 1965. [...] It is based on Johnny Burnette's adaptation, but Beck biographer Annette Carson comments their [...] "propulsive, power-driven version, however, deviated radically from the original... recording plucked the old Rock & Roll Trio number from obscurity {{and turned it into}} a classic among classics". [...] The Yardbirds' lead guitarist Jeff Beck, who is a fan of early rockabilly, said that he introduced the song to the group: [...] "They <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> me play the riff, and they loved it and made up their version of it". [...] Giorgio Gomelsky, the group' first producer, states that Sonny Boy Williamson II's use of blues harp to imitate train sounds during his 1963 UK tour with the Yardbirds also inspired the band's adaptation of the song.|$|E

500|$|In an Entertainment Weekly {{poll that}} judged all the {{television}} season finales of the year, Lexie's death was voted the [...] "Top Tissue Moment", while Robbins' injured leg and Shepherd's mangled hand were voted the [...] "Most Disturbing Image".

Lexie's death was also nominated under the [...] "Best (Presumed) Death" [...] category, while the plane crash's aftermath was nominated as the [...] "Best Non-romantic Cliffhanger", and the episode in entirety was nominated for the special award for [...] "Biggest Regret That I Didn't See It, I <b>Just</b> <b>Heard</b> or Read About It". Entertainment Weekly later named the scene where Meredith is crying {{one of the best}} crying scenes of 2012. In TVLine's review of 2012, Lexie's death was runner-up for [...] "Biggest Tearjerker". The episode is nominated at the NAACP Image Awards under the Outstanding Writing in a Dramatic Series category for Rhimes.|$|E
500|$|Greg Beeman, who {{directed}} the episode, spoke about Remi Aubuchon's hiring. He said that Remi had [...] "a lot of {{ideas about how to}} keep the good stuff we’d established in Season 1", and [...] "diminish the things that weren’t as strong". Steven Spielberg's original conception of Falling Skies was that the characters in the series would be nomadic. The idea for the second season was to [...] "create a mobile refugee camp made up of vehicles and rag-tag tents." [...] Chris Faloona, who was the Director of Photography in the first season, was unable to return due to commitments on another series, and Nate Goodman was hired. Aubuchon and Beeman discussed what was a head for the characters this season, and soon after, Beeman called Connor Jessup, who plays Ben Mason, and said [...] "I’ve <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> what the plans are for you for this season. [...] And my strong advice is that you get a trainer and start eating your Wheaties! [...] You are in a HUGE storyline is going to revolve around you… [...] You’re a warrior, you’re a skitter killer and you’re a badass!" [...] Jessup hired a trainer that very day.|$|E

So {{the two of us}} together joining forces is going to be huge!" [...] When asked if [...] "Make the World Move" [...] would be released as a single, Aguilera replied saying that she was not sure about what would be done with the song. In an interview with MTV News in November, Aguilera explained how she felt the song would be suited to Green as she felt a male vocal contribution was needed, saying: [...] "I got to collaborate with my good buddy Cee Lo... There was a part for a potential male vocal on the chorus, and I <b>just</b> <b>heard</b> immediately Cee Lo's voice on it, his signature Cee Lo, and it was fun collaborating with him and having him on my record and us joining forces together." ...|$|E
