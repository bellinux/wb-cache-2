40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{attitude}} estimation problem for an accelerated rigid body using gyros and accelerometers. The application {{in mind is}} that of a walking robot and particular attention is paid to the large and abrupt changes in accelerations that can be expected in such an environment. We propose a state estimation algorithm that fuses data from rate gyros and accelerometers to give long-term drift free attitude estimates. The algorithm does not use any local parameterization of the rigid body kinematics and can thus be used for a rigid body performing any kind of rotations. The algorithm is a combination of two non-standard, but in a sense linear, Kalman filters between which a trigger based switching takes place. The kinematics representation used makes it possible to construct a linear algorithm that can be shown to give convergent estimates for this nonlinear problem. The state estimator is evaluated in simulations demonstrating how the estimates are long term stable even in the presence of <b>gyrodrift...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of a strapdown inertial navigation system (SINS) largely depends on the accuracy and rapidness of the initial alignment. The conventional alignment method with parameter identification has been already applied widely, but it needs to calculate the gyroscope drifts through two-position method; then the time of initial alignment is greatly prolonged. For this issue, a novel self-alignment algorithm by parameter identification method under inertial frame for SINS is proposed in this paper. Firstly, this coarse alignment method using the gravity in the inertial frame as a reference is discussed to overcome the limit of dynamic disturbance on a rocking base and fulfill the requirement for the fine alignment. Secondly, the fine alignment method by parameter identification under inertial frame is formulated. The theoretical analysis {{results show that the}} fine alignment model is fully self-aligned with no external reference information and the <b>gyrodrifts</b> can be estimated in real time. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can achieve rapid and highly accurate initial alignment for SINS...|$|R
