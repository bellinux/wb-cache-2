40|$|Introduction: This work {{presents}} {{a new approach}} for <b>Digital</b> <b>Curations</b> from a Big Data perspective. Objective: The objective is to propose techniques to <b>digital</b> <b>curations</b> for selecting and evaluating digital objects that take into account volume, velocity, variety, reality, {{and the value of}} the data collected from multiple knowledge domains. Methodology: This is an exploratory research of applied nature, which addresses the research problem in a qualitative way. Heuristics allow this semi-automatic process to be done either by human curators or by software agents. Results: As a result, it was proposed a model for searching, processing, evaluating and selecting digital objects to be processed by <b>digital</b> <b>curations.</b> Conclusions: It is possible to use Big Data environments as a source of information resources for Digital Curation; besides, Big Data techniques and tools can support the search and selection process of information resources by <b>Digital</b> <b>Curations.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|This {{deliverable}} {{describes the}} conception {{and execution of}} the survey on training needs in <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation</b> {{carried out in the}} context of the DigCurV project. It summarises the main findings of the survey together with those from a series of focus group meetings held in the partner countries and also an analysis of job advertisements which have appeared since January 2011 when the project began. The detailed analysis of the survey results is available as an appendix to this deliverable. Section 2 gives an overview of the three components of the research carried out. Section 3, after an introduction, presents the results of the survey on training needs that was carried out in July and August 2011. The survey aimed at identifying the skills and competences needed for <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation</b> as well as the needs for vocational education and training in this field. It was structured into four parts that concentrated on basic information about the respondent’s organisation, training plans and preferences, the skills and competences required and the training needs. The survey received 454 valid responses from 44 countries, with the majority of them coming from Europe. The participants represent a broad spectrum of organisations from the cultural heritage as well as the scientific and education sectors and are engaged in a variety of activities with regard to <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation.</b> The data collected shows that the overwhelming majority of organisations face the challenge of <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation.</b> About three quarters of the institutions in our survey already store digital materials for long-term preservation and almost a fifth are planning to do so in the future. Despite this fact, more than half of the organisations do not intend to hire new staff for digital preservation activities. In many cases it seems likely that the tasks associated with the long-term storage of digital assets will be assigned to existing staff who will need to acquire the necessary skills and competences if they do not have these already. Thus the survey results suggest there is likely to be a substantial need for appropriate training amongst these organisations. Section 4 gives a summary of the analysis of the focus groups that were conducted to gather additional information from stakeholders. The findings support the results of the survey analysis. The participants reported a severe lack of professionals with the appropriate skills for <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation</b> both among existing staff of their institutions and potential staff on the labour market. They expressed an urgent need for training, particularly with regard to IT skills and technical digital preservation skills. Generic skills, management skills and the ability to train others have also been indicated as areas with a considerable training need. Section 5 presents the analysis of 48 job advertisements for positions in the field of <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation.</b> The information obtained with regard to the tasks, skills and competences relevant in the field of <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation</b> underpins the findings of the survey and the focus groups. The task responsibilities and the corresponding skills, competences and knowledge are wide-ranging and cover many digital preservation-specific and technical as well as general areas. Section 6 synthesises the findings and draws conclusions. The results of the research suggest a great demand for training in <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation</b> that arises from a serious lack of qualified staff in the field. The findings revealed a broad spectrum of skills and competences relevant for staff involved in digital preservation. When designing training, this diversity as well as the integration of practical application and the suitability of the format for working staff should be taken into account. This report together with the report on the baseline survey on training opportunities and the evaluation framework will be used as a background for developing a curriculum framework for vocational education and training in the field...|$|R

5000|$|Sheer {{curation}} is {{an approach}} to <b>digital</b> <b>curation</b> where curation activities are quietly integrated into the normal work flow of those creating and managing data and other digital assets. The word sheer is used to emphasize the lightweight and virtually transparent nature of these curation activities. The term sheer curation was coined by Alistair Miles in the ImageStore project, and the UK <b>Digital</b> <b>Curation</b> Centre's SCARP project. The approach depends on curators having close contact or 'immersion' in data creators' working practices. An example is the case study of a neuroimaging research group by Whyte et al., which explored ways of building its <b>digital</b> <b>curation</b> capacity around the apprenticeship style of learning of neuroimaging researchers, through which they share access to datasets and re-use experimental procedures.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} the results of the DigCurV review of training needs in the field of <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation.</b> The project carried out three research activities during 2011 and in early 2012 : an online survey, a series of focus groups, and an analysis of job advertisements. The results indicate a severe lack of qualified staff as well as a lack of appropriate training options for <b>digital</b> preservation and <b>curation.</b> Staff working in this area need to have a broad spectrum of skills and competences. These comprise both generic and digital preservation-specific and technical skills and competences. An urgent need for training was stated in terms of digital preservation-specific and technical as well as with regard to generic skills. When asked to set priorities and indicate the areas where the need for training was most pressing, respondents clearly assigned these to the digital preservation-specific and technical skills...|$|R
