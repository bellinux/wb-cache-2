40|$|Ceramic {{industry}} {{represents an}} important sector {{of economic activity}} in the European countries and involves complex and numerous manufacturing processes. The unidirectional <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process includes milling and stirring of raw materials (mainly clay and talc minerals) in aqueous suspensions, followed by spray drying to remove excess water obtaining spray-dried powders further subjected to <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process (conformation). However, spray-dried ceramic powders exhibit an important variability in their performance when subjected to the <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process, particularly in the adhesion to the mold and mechanical strength, affecting the quality of the final conformed ceramic products. Therefore, several synthetic additives (deflocculants, antifoams, binders, lubricants and plasticizers) are introduced in the ceramic slips to achieve uniform and homogeneous pastes, conditioning their rheological properties. However, an important variability associated with the performance of the conformed products is still reported. Exopolysaccharides or Extracellular Polymeric Substances (EPS) are polymers excreted by living organisms, such as bacteria, fungi and algae, which may confer unique and potentially interesting properties with potential industrial uses, such as viscosity control, gelation, and flocculation. Polysaccharides, such as pullulan, gellan, carrageenan and xanthan have found a wide range of applications in food, pharmaceutical, petroleum, and in other industries. The aim of this study was the assessment of exopolysaccharides as natural additives to optimize the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during the unidirectional <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process, replacing the synthetic additives used in the ceramic production process. Six exopolysaccharides, namely pullulan, gellan, xanthan gum, κappa- and iota-carrageenan, and guar gum were tested in steatite-based spray-dried ceramic powders at different concentrations. Subsequently, these ceramic powders were submitted to unidirectional <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process (conformation) and the green conformed bodies were tested on the following properties: mechanical flexural strength and adhesion/disaggregation of the conformed material. The binding state of polysaccharides and mineral grains was evaluated by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM). Our data showed that xanthan gum and pullulan were the most effective polysaccharides in improving the performance of spray-dried ceramic powders during unidirectional <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process, in comparison to the control steatite-based ceramic bodies containing synthetic additives. In addition, these polysaccharides yielded the best cost-benefit relationship, representing an eco-friendly and cost-effective alternative to synthetic additives used in technical ceramics industry. Hence, this study has contributed to define a new and sustainable strategy to improve the performance of ceramic materials during unidirectional <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> process, reduce production costs and minimize environmental impact.

In such cases the use of agglomerated powders or binder addition cannot be avoided.

40|$|Pegmatite is {{the main}} source of {{feldspar}} for ceramics industry. Usage of pegmatite in ceramic industry causes some problems due to the presence of mica and iron oxides. These materials reduce tile strength, hardness and density of the final product leading to low quality ceramic products. Southern Saudi pegmatite separation treatment was carried out in two phases in order to improve the ceramic quality of the feldspar obtained from this pegmatite. The first phase consists of gravitational separation to remove the heavy impurities and in the second phase magnetic separation was carried out to further minimize iron content. Porcelain ceramic batches were prepared by wet-mixing, <b>drying,</b> <b>pressing</b> (semi-dry press) and fired at temperatures from 1000 to 1350 °C. The porcelain ceramic bodies were prepared and examined by DTA, X-ray diffraction, SEM and tested for bulk density, linear shrinkage, water absorption and flexural strength. These results indicated that, after treatment (gravity and magnetic separation), the pegmatite can be considered as a good source of potash feldspar. The present study provides a positive indication for using of Southern Saudi pegmatite after treatment in ceramic industries...|$|R

40|$|Thermal {{granulation}} is {{an important}} technological step especially in the processing of nano- and colloidal disperse ceramic or hardmetal powders. High energy milling and homogenization require a fluid phase (water, organic solvents) - <b>dry</b> <b>pressing</b> or thermal spraying techniques require granule bulks with tailored properties (size distribution, flowability, densification behavior; specific fracture load and surface structure of the granules). Thus direct granulation methods are necessary for the processing of the suspension to a homogeneous bulk.
