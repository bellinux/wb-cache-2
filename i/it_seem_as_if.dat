5|$|The pre-credits {{sequence}} used {{a church}} in Stoke Poges as a cemetery, while the helicopter scenes were filmed at the abandoned Beckton Gas Works in London. The gas works were also the location for some of Stanley Kubrick's 1987 film, Full Metal Jacket. Director John Glen {{got the idea for}} the remote-controlled helicopter after seeing a child playing with an RC car. Since flying a helicopter through a warehouse was thought to be too dangerous, the scene was shot using forced perspective. A smaller mock-up was built by Derek Meddings' team closer to the camera that the stunt pilot Marc Wolff flew behind and this made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the helicopter was entering the warehouse. The footage inside the building was shot on location, though with a life-sized helicopter model which stood over a rail. Stuntman Martin Grace stood as Bond when the agent is dangling outside the flying helicopter, while Roger Moore himself was used in the scenes inside the model.|$|E

His team is working to discredit the Doom Patrol, having been coached in various ways on how to make the heroes look bad for the cameras. Unknown to the Front Men, 'Mister Somebody' has rigged their uniforms to deliver fatal blows in ways that make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the Doom Patrol killed them intentionally.|$|E

The Academy's Science and Technology committee honored Widmer for helping develop methods for advancing the art of storytelling on film: Most notable: processes that make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> actors are in faraway locations {{when in fact they}} are working on sound stages in Hollywood or elsewhere.|$|E

25|$|Kabir {{was not in}} England {{contention}} {{during the}} 2006 season, and for the winter of 2006–07 he turned out for Rajasthan in the Ranji Trophy along with team-mate Vikram Solanki. Worcestershire's 2007 season began poorly, but Kabir claimed a career-best 8–50 in a rain-affected match against Lancashire in May. These were the best figures at Old Trafford for 13 years. On 15 August 2009 Hampshire confirmed they had signed Ali on a 3-year deal, subject to resolving Worcestershires demands for compensation of £60,000. Hampshire were not willing to meet Worcestershire's demands for compensation, making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Ali would have to honour the remaining year on his Worcestershire contract. In January 2010 Ali's dispute with Worcestershire was intensified, with Ali failing to report for pre-season training.|$|E
25|$|At {{one point}} in the film, Dante {{attempted}} to involve his audience in the story by making <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the gremlins had taken control of the theatre where Gremlins 2 was showing. The film strip appears to be broken by the gremlins, who then engage in shadow puppetry over a white screen before replacing the reel with the vintage nudie film Volleyball Holiday. Hulk Hogan then makes a cameo appearance as an audience member and intimidates the gremlins into running the rest of Gremlins 2. This joke was inspired by a similar stunt in William Castle's film The Tingler (1959). The studio feared that people might leave the theatre if they thought the film had broken; Dante therefore secured the inclusion of the sequence by assembling some people for a preview of the film. When the scene was shown, the real-life audience found it enjoyable and stayed in the theatre. Dante later described this scene {{as one of the most}} widely enjoyed jokes in Gremlins 2. When the film made its debut on home video, the filmmakers replaced the scene, to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the viewer's VCR had been broken by the gremlins. In this version, the gremlins do their shadow puppetry over white noise before changing the VCR's channels. Their antics stop at a broadcast of Chisum, where John Wayne forces the gremlins into continuing the film, although voice impersonation was needed since Wayne had been dead since 1979; actor Chad Everett was recommended by Wayne's son Patrick Wayne. Notably, a clip from Falling Hare, a film released in 1943 featuring Bugs Bunny and a gremlin, appears in this version. These sequences occur in lieu of the Hulk Hogan sequence which also featured Paul Bartel; home video audiences would not see these sequences until the DVD release (which includes the reworked VHS scene as a bonus feature).|$|E
25|$|Jill, Kirby, Charlie, Robbie and Trevor are at Kirby's {{house when}} Ghostface appears and murders a drunken Robbie. Sidney {{arrives at the}} house. Kirby is forced to answer horror movie trivia to save Charlie, who is tied up outside. Sidney goes upstairs to find Jill, {{promising}} to return to Kirby. After Kirby answers Ghostface's questions, she goes outside to untie Charlie, believing that she has won the game. He suddenly stabs her in the stomach and reveals himself as Ghostface, before leaving her for dead. Sidney is confronted by Charlie and a second Ghostface, who is revealed as Jill. Jill explains that her motive was out of jealousy because of the attention Sidney got for surviving the murders, and that they intend to frame Trevor as Ghostface; she then pulls Trevor out of a closet and shoots him in the head. Jill then betrays Charlie and kills him, too, to pin him as Trevor's accomplice and to make herself the sole survivor. Jill stabs Sidney in the stomach and mutilates herself to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Trevor attacked her. Later, Dewey, Judy, {{and the rest of}} the police stumble upon the carnage.|$|E

25|$|Although Black {{was mostly}} {{successful}} in America, {{months prior to}} her final SHIMMER appearance she lost her RQW Women's Championship at a 16 June RQW event to German wrestler Wesna, with Jetta and Amazing Kong also competing in the four way elimination match. Her rematch with Wesna, this time in a singles match, took place at ChickFight IX.5 but ended in a controversial manner when Jetta interfered in the match to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Black had used a foreign object, thus having her disqualified. Enraged, Black chased Jetta {{out of the building}} but the two were booked for a grudge match later on that same night; Giving Jetta a taste of her own medicine, Black attacked her from behind during her entrance leading to a brawl all around ringside that consumed most of the match until it officially began inside the ring with Black eventually losing as Jetta used the ropes for the pin. After Black was on the winning side of the tag team match at Shimmer, it became clear the two needed to settle their feud one-on-one and RQW decided to host the match in October. However, the hotly anticipated bout ended in a double count-out ostensibly due to the fierce fighting between the two, though Black had actually suffered a legitimate shoulder injury during the match and could not carry on.|$|E
500|$|Gyllenhaal played Yelena Andreevna in the Classic Stage Company's 2009 Off-Broadway {{production}} of Anton Chekhov's Uncle Vanya in New York City. The cast also included Peter Sarsgaard, Mamie Gummer, Denis Leary, and George Foreman. The production, directed by Martin Scorsese, began previews on January 17 and ended its limited run on March 1. Joe Dziemianowicz of the New York Daily News {{was less than}} enthusiastic about her performance, writing: [...] "Gyllenhaal, who was so dynamic as a druggie in the film Sherrybaby, plays Yelena with a slow-mo saunter and monotonous pasted-on smile that makes <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> she's been in Sherry's stash." [...] However, Malcolm Johnson of the Hartford Courant was complimentary, noting that she [...] "ultimately blossoms" [...] as the character.|$|E
500|$|Like {{many other}} U2 songs, [...] "City of Blinding Lights" [...] can be {{interpreted}} in a religious manner. Author Cameron Conant related the opening verse to the doubt he felt about his convictions on politics, marriage, and faith as he aged, concluding that a person's confidence in their beliefs makes <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> they know more than they do. Music critic Bill Friskics-Warren felt that the final line, [...] "Blessings {{not just for the}} ones who kneel, luckily", was a way for Bono to berate himself for not praying enough, and was an attack on Christianity because [...] "faith often perpetuates the misery and divisiveness that he decries." [...] Steve Stockman, a chaplain at Queen's University of Belfast, believed the song was a metaphor for growing up, and that the final line meant that not just people of faith could be blessed.|$|E

500|$|Matt Webb Mitovich of TV Guide {{said that}} he was finally {{starting}} to understand Jenna, and how she fits into the show. He said that even though she was supposed to come off as flighty and disillusioned at times, he realized that in reality she was not completely flighty and disillusioned. He also noted the development in Liz and Jenna's friendship, learning that they go [...] "way back" [...] as friends and as a comedy team. Julia Ward of AOL's TV Squad disagreed, however. She felt that the show had too many storylines and that this episode made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the show was about the relationship between Liz and Jenna, rather than the storylines introduced in the pilot. She said that having several ongoing storylines is possible, but the show needs some kind of center.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, Parker Brothers {{published}} four further editions {{along with}} the original two: the Popular Edition, Fine Edition, Gold Edition, and Deluxe Edition, with prices ranging from US$2 to US$25 in 1930s money. After Parker Brothers began to release its first editions of the game, Elizabeth Magie Phillips was profiled in the Washington D.C. Evening Star newspaper, which discussed her two editions of The Landlord's Game. In December 1936, wary of the Mah-Jongg and Ping-Pong fads that had left unsold inventory stuck in Parker Brothers' warehouse, George Parker ordered a stop to Monopoly production as sales leveled off. However, during the Christmas season, sales picked up again, and continued a resurgence. In early 1937, as Parker Brothers was preparing to release the board game Bulls and Bears with Darrow's photograph on the box lid (though he had no involvement with the game), a Time magazine article about the game made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> Darrow himself was the sole inventor of both Bulls and Bears and Monopoly: ...|$|E
500|$|Perry is the docile pet platypus of the blended Flynn-Fletcher family, who adopted {{him because}} his unfocused gaze made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> he {{were looking at}} both Phineas and Ferb at the same time, {{as shown in the}} 2011 movie, [...] Unbeknownst to them, Perry lives a double life as a crime-fighting spy working for the [...] "Organization Without a Cool Acronym"/The OWCA, going by the codename [...] "Agent P." [...] He reports to his superior, Major Monogram, via {{telecast}} in his large, high-tech, underground hideout. Every day, he engages in battles with the evil scientist Dr. Heinz Doofenshmirtz, who tries using inventions to take over the tri-state area. Perry is always able to foil Doofenshmirtz's plans and in doing so accidentally leads to the destruction of whatever form of contraption his owners, Phineas Flynn and Ferb Fletcher, are building in order to make summer better. Phineas and Ferb are aware that something happens to get rid of their scheme for the day, but do not know that Perry is the cause behind it and are largely dismissive of it. Their sister, Candace, also does not know that Perry is behind the destruction and is driven to near insanity trying to figure it out. Throughout the series, Perry is aware of Phineas and Ferb's inventions, but is largely uninterested in them, save whenever he notices that their latest invention may help him thwart Doofenshmirtz.|$|E

500|$|She {{returned}} to the stage wearing a tank top with glittery tomboy looking suspenders and pants for a dance-oriented performance of [...] "Boys". The show continued with [...] "Stronger", in which she wore a paint-covered robe and in some shows a bowler hat. At {{the end of the}} performance, she sat down next to a piano player and talked to the audience before moving into a performance of [...] "I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman". A video interlude spoofing Making the Band-type shows followed, showing Spears and her dancers as a struggling band. She took the stage again in a barge (wearing a black, silver, and gray rock star style jacket and green pants) along with four female dancers to perform [...] "I Love Rock 'n' Roll". The barge was lifted by wires, but pyrotechnics below it made <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it was lifted by fire. When it was above the B-stage, Spears jumped to it with bungee cords. There was a skit in which her dancers chased her, before Spears loses the rock star jacket revealing a glittery red and purple halter top for a performance of [...] "What It's Like To Be Me" [...] in the small stage. She {{returned to}} the main stage for a performance of [...] "Lonely", in which she danced to a video projection of herself. The dancers and the band performed the [...] "Breakdown" [...] interlude. In [...] "Don't Let Me Be the Last to Know", she sang on an elevated platform wearing a white evening gown, while two of her dancers performed a routine. Artificial snow fell from the ceiling during the performance.|$|E
500|$|Writer Novak {{cites the}} episode as the [...] "most conceptually ambitious" [...] in the show's history. More {{than half the}} episode {{consisted}} of footage from the film. Originally, the producers considered showing just the movie, but they felt that it [...] "would feel like a gimmick or experiment", {{and so it was}} decided that the film would be intercut with shots of the office reacting to the film. In order to make the film seem as if Michael had created it, the film used was colorized in post-production to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> it were of a cheaper quality than the normal high-quality film that the series used. Certain shooting methods, like hand-held and zooms, were nixed, except for in cases where they could be presented in a [...] "poorly-executed" [...] manner. This was done in a way to make it appear that Michael at least knew what he was doing; Novak explained that the crew [...] "didn't want the joke of the episode to be how bad he was at filmmaking" [...] because it would [...] "be a little easy and a little out of character". To create the fake dummy of Toby that exploded, Paul Lieberstein was required to spend several hours in a full-face mold that reportedly [...] "unnerved him greatly". Two molds were taken. Both were filled with explosives, but one was filled with fake blood. Both were shot with slow-motion cameras. However, the dummy with the fake blood in it was considered [...] "too disturbing for us and arguably too disturbing for Michael", and so the tamer explosion was used.|$|E
500|$|Toriyama {{said that}} by {{the second half of}} the series, he had become more {{interested}} in coming up with the story than drawing it, and that the battles became more intense by him simplifying the lines. He also said he would get letters from readers complaining that the art had become [...] "too square", so he intentionally made it more so. Years later he stated that because Dragon Ball is an action manga the most important aspect is the sense of speed, so he did not draw very elaborately, suggesting that he was not interested in the art. As the manga progressed, he struggled with the Android and Cell arc, feeling that the manga could not outdo the Freeza arc. He added time travel, but said he had a hard time with the plot, only being able to think of what to do that week. After Cell's death, Toriyama intended for Gohan to replace Goku as the series' protagonist, but felt the character was not suited for it and changed his mind. Even after the Cell arc, Toriyama felt it could not end there and so continued to the Majin Boo arc. Having resolved it would be the finale, he decided to draw what he wanted and inserted comedy with Gohan's Great Saiyaman persona and the character Gotenks. However, he did not think of an ending until the final chapter. At the time, Toriyama said he gave Dragon Ball a low-key ending to make <b>it</b> <b>seem</b> <b>as</b> <b>if</b> the story might continue. But would later say he skipped 10 years ahead in the story to signal that it was truly the end. Wanting to make it clear that Goku's battles were over, and a new generation was taking over, Toriyama added a message to the ending for the kanzenban re-release of Dragon Ball which finished in 2004.|$|E
