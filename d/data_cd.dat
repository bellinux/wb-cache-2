2500|$|The CD-R, {{originally}} named CD Write-Once (WO), specification {{was first}} published in 1988 by Philips and Sony in the 'Orange Book'. The Orange Book consists of several parts, furnishing details of the CD-WO, CD-MO (Magneto-Optic), and CD-RW (ReWritable). The latest editions have abandoned {{the use of the term}} [...] "CD-WO" [...] in favor of [...] "CD-R", while [...] "CD-MO" [...] were used very little. [...] Written CD-Rs and CD-RWs are, in the aspect of low-level encoding and data format, fully compatible with the audio CD (Red Book CD-DA) and <b>data</b> <b>CD</b> (Yellow Book CD-ROM) standards. [...] (Note that the Yellow Book standard for CD-ROM only specifies a high-level data format and refers to the Red Book for all physical format and low-level code details, such as track pitch, linear bit density, and bitstream encoding.) [...] This means they use Eight-to-Fourteen Modulation, CIRC error correction, and, for CD-ROM, the third error correction layer defined in the Yellow Book. [...] Properly written CD-R discs on blanks of less than 80 minutes length are fully compatible with the audio CD and CD-ROM standards in all details including physical specifications. [...] 80 minute CD-R discs marginally violate the Red Book physical format specifications, and longer discs are noncompliant. [...] CD-RW discs have lower reflectivity than CD-R or pressed (non-writable) CDs and for this reason cannot meet the Red Book standard (or come close). [...] Some hardware compatible with Red Book CDs may have difficulty reading CD-Rs and, because of their lower reflectivity, especially CD-RWs. [...] To the extent that CD hardware can read extended-length discs or CD-RW discs, it is because that hardware has capability beyond the minimum required by the Red Book and Yellow Book standards (the hardware is more capable than it needs to be to bear the Compact Disc logo).|$|E

40|$|AbstractA {{statistically}} coherent view of confounding {{motivated by}} the over controversy over the proper control of confounding {{in the presence of}} prior knowledge is presented. Confounding by a covariate C in the presence of <b>data</b> on <b>C</b> is distinguished from confounding in the absence of <b>data</b> on <b>C.</b> A covariate C is defined to be a nonconfounder in the absence of <b>data</b> on <b>C</b> if the population parameter of interest can be unbiasedly estimated (asymptotically) absent <b>data</b> on <b>C.</b> Under this definition, C may be a confounder for some parameters of interest and a nonconfounder for others. If C is a confounder for a parameter of interest that has a causal interpretation, we call C a causal confounder. When <b>data</b> on <b>C</b> are available, C is defined to be a nonconfounder for a particular parameter of interest if and only if inference on the parameter of interest does not depend on the <b>data</b> through <b>C.</b> Bayesians, frequentists and pure likelihoodists will in general agree on the prior knowledge necessary to render C a non-confounder. In particular C will in general be a nonconfounder precisely when the crude <b>data</b> ignoring <b>C</b> are S-sufficient for the parameter of interest. The intuitive view held by many practicing epidemiologists that confounding by C represents a bias of the unadjusted crude estimator is in a sense correct provided inference is performed conditional on approximate ancillary statistics that measure the degree to which associations in the data differ due to sampling variability from those population associations known a priori...|$|R

50|$|Beside the main-channel {{which holds}} {{all of the}} user-data, a CD-ROM {{contains}} a set of eight sub-channels where certain meta-information can be stored. (For an audio CD, the user-data is the audio itself; for a <b>data</b> <b>CD,</b> it is the filesystem and file data.) One of the sub-channels — the Q-channel — states the drive's current position relative {{to the beginning of}} the CD and the current track. This was designed for Audio-CDs (which for a few years were the only CDs), where this information is used to keep the drive on track; nevertheless the Q-channel is filled even on Data-CDs. Another sub-channel, the P-channel (which is the first of the subchannels) carries even more primitive information—a sort of semaphore—indicating the points where each track starts.|$|E

5000|$|In 2012 Ruscio and Roche {{introduced}} the comparative <b>data</b> (<b>CD)</b> procedure {{in an attempt}} improve upon the PA method. The authors state that [...] "rather than generating random datasets, which only take into account sampling error, multiple datasets with known factorial structures are analyzed to determine which best reproduces the profile of eigenvalues for the actual data" [...] (p. 258). The strength of the procedure {{is its ability to}} not only incorporate sampling error, but also the factorial structure and multivariate distribution of the items. Ruscio and Roche's (2012) simulation study determined that the CD procedure outperformed many other methods aimed at determining the correct number of factors to retain. In that study, the CD technique, making use of Pearson correlations accurately predicted the correct number of factors 87.14% of the time. Although, {{it should be noted that}} the simulated study did not involve more than five factors. Therefore, the applicability of the CD procedure to estimate factorial structures beyond five factors is yet to be tested. Courtney includes this procedure in his recommended list and gives guidelines showing how it can be easily carried out from within SPSS's user interface.|$|E
