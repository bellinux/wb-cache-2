5|$|The Vietnam Campaign Medal was {{an award}} of South Vietnam for those {{individuals}} who served in Vietnam {{for a period of}} at least six months. Although it was a personal award, Coast Guard regulations permitted its <b>display</b> <b>on</b> a cutter's port and starboard bridge wings since Squadron One's cutters served during the eligibility period of 1 March 1961 to 28 March 1973.|$|E
5|$|The forward {{fuselage}} did go on <b>display</b> <b>on</b> 28 June 1995. On 2 July 1995, three {{people were arrested}} for throwing ash and human blood on the aircraft's fuselage, following an earlier incident in which a protester had thrown red paint over the gallery's carpeting. The exhibition closed on 18 May 1998, and the fuselage was returned to the Garber Facility for final restoration.|$|E
5|$|The spiral {{staircase}} {{to the second}} floor is original. The floor continues the two-room design, and the roof, largely a post-war replacement with only a few surviving medieval timbers, is intended to resemble the original medieval design. The fireplace and windows are original, as probably is the 14th-century wooden door to the floor. Both the wall between the two rooms, and its stone doorway, were built in the 18th century. The room contains a <b>display</b> <b>on</b> the history of the tower, and some of the original wooden foundations of the building.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background For {{industrial}} bioconversion processes, {{the utilization}} of surface-displayed lipase {{in the form of}} whole-cell biocatalysts is more advantageous, because the enzymes are <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> the cell surface spontaneously, regarded as immobilized enzymes. Results Two Pichia pastoris cell surface <b>display</b> vectors based <b>on</b> the flocculation functional domain of FLO with its own secretion signal sequence or the α-factor secretion signal sequence were constructed respectively. The lipase gene lipB 52 fused with the FLO gene was successfully transformed into Pichia pastoris KM 71. The lipase LipB 52 was expressed {{under the control of the}} AOX 1 promoter and <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> Pichia pastoris KM 71 cell surface with the two Pichia pastoris cell surface display vectors. Localization of the <b>displayed</b> LipB 52 <b>on</b> the cell surface was confirmed by the confocal laser scanning microscopy (CLSM). The LipB 52 <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> the Pichia pastoris cell surface exhibited activity toward p -nitrophenol ester with carbon chain length ranging from C 10 to C 18, and the optimum substrate was p -nitrophenol-caprate (C 10), which was consistent with it <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> the Saccharomyces cerevisiae EBY 100 cell surface. The hydrolysis activity of lipase LipB 52 <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> Pichia pastoris KM 71 -pLHJ 047 and KM 71 -pLHJ 048 cell surface reached 94 and 91 U/g dry cell, respectively. The optimum temperature of the displayed lipases was 40 °C at pH 8. 0, they retained over 90 % activity after incubation at 60 °C for 2 hours at pH 7. 0, and still retained 85 % activity after incubation for 3 hours. Conclusion The LipB 52 <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> the Pichia pastoris cell surface exhibited better stability than the lipase LipB 52 <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface. The displayed lipases exhibited similar transesterification activity. But the Pichia pastoris dry cell weight per liter (DCW/L) ferment culture was about 5 times than Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the lipase <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> Pichia pastoris are more suitable for whole-cell biocatalysts than that <b>displayed</b> <b>on</b> Saccharomyces cerevisiae cell surface. </p...|$|R

5|$|Between 1998–2001, Melbourne was {{the only}} club to display player names {{on the back of}} jerseys. This was because there was no major sponsor for the Storm to <b>display</b> <b>on</b> the chest or back at the time and in {{addition}} it helped supporters new to the game identify the players. In 2001, Melbourne gained its first major sponsor in Adecco, and was displayed on the jersey chest, while maintaining the players names on the back until the end of 2001. In 2002, the Storm removed the player's names and displayed Adecco's logo on the back. Since then the Storm have had varying sponsors adorning the Jersey.|$|E
5|$|Clayman (IGN) {{reported}} that the game had no major technical issues, which was a major concern in the protracted run-up to the game's release. He also found that most of its levels {{did not appear to}} leverage the Xbox 360's advances in areas apart from graphics. Bramwell (Eurogamer), on the other hand, fought the controls and camera throughout the game. He lamented a particular issue in which the camera would spin 180 degrees when Kameo was hit, which made the path of retreat harder to see. Theobald (GameSpy) also lamented the camera. Kasavin (GameSpot) found Kameo to be technically outstanding, and praised its automatic game save features, short loading times, steady frame rates, and detailed <b>display</b> <b>on</b> both standard- and high-definition televisions. Pfister (1UP.com) wrote that Kameo was technically impressive to the point of overwhelming the gameplay.|$|E

His family members accepted the award on his behalf during a ceremony on April 28 at the U.S. Naval Academy Museum in Annapolis, Maryland, where it is on permanent <b>display.</b> <b>On</b> May 4, 2011, the U.S. Postal Service issued a first-class stamp in Shepard's honor, the first U.S. stamp to depict a specific astronaut.
