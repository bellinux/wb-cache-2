5|$|In {{the early}} 20th century, the English {{bacteriologist}} Frederick Twort discovered {{a group of}} viruses that infect bacteria, now called bacteriophages (or commonly phages), and the French-Canadian microbiologist Félix d'Herelle described viruses that, when added to bacteria on an agar plate, would produce areas of dead bacteria. He accurately diluted a suspension of these viruses and discovered that the highest dilutions (lowest virus concentrations), rather than killing all the bacteria, formed discrete areas of dead organisms. Counting these areas and multiplying by the <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> allowed him to calculate the number of viruses in the original suspension. Phages were heralded as a potential treatment for diseases such as typhoid and cholera, but their promise was forgotten {{with the development of}} penicillin. The study of phages provided insights into the switching on and off of genes, and a useful mechanism for introducing foreign genes into bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Pursuit {{predation}} {{revolves around}} a distinct movement interaction between predator and prey; as prey move {{to find new}} foraging areas, predators should move with them. Predators congregate in areas of high prey density, and prey should therefore avoid these areas. However, <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> may be a reason to stay in areas of high density due to a decreased risk of predation. Given the movements of predators over ranges in pursuit predation, though, <b>dilution</b> <b>factor</b> seems a less important cause for predation avoidance. Because of these interactions, spatial patterns of predators and prey are important in preserving population size. Attempts by prey to avoid predation and find food are coupled with predator attempts to hunt and compete with other predators. These interactions act to preserve populations. Models of spatial patterns and synchrony of predator-prey relationships {{can be used as}} support for the evolution of pursuit predation as one mechanism to preserve these population mechanics. By pursuing prey over long distances, predators actually improve longterm survival of both their own population and prey population through population synchrony. Pursuit predation acts to even out population fluctuations by moving predatory animals from areas of high predator density to low predator density, and low prey density to high prey density. This keeps migratory populations in synchrony, which increases metapopulation persistence. Pursuit predation’s effect on population persistence is more marked over larger travel ranges. Predator and prey levels are usually more synchronous in predation over larger ranges, as population densities have more ability to even out. Pursuit predation can then be supported as an adaptive mechanism for not just individual feeding success but also metapopulation persistence.|$|E

40|$|Of {{the many}} factors which {{influence}} {{the exposure of}} the freshwater aquatic environment to contaminating chemicals none has a more dramatic effect than dilution. Both where and when a chemical enters surface water will make an enormous difference to its impact on wildlife. This is of particular importance for "down-the-drain” chemicals as these substances are discharged to freshwaters via sewer systems after consumer use. However, too often, this dilution capacity is fixed to a “generic” value. Although the spatial variability of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> is often acknowledged, temporal variability is often unaccounted for which may potentially lead to underestimating the environmental risk. To address the magnitude of these dilution differences across the world, estimates of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> were developed globally at a 0. 5 ° resolution using gridded data. Thus, the focus here is on the numbers and location of the human population and the river water available to dilute their waste. The river flows estimates are calculated at both annual and monthly resolution based on readily available annual and monthly runoff estimates. The domestic waste water effluent is derived from combining gridded population and national per capita domestic water use estimates. For each grid cell both annual and monthly <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> were generated. This approach allowed the quantification of temporal and spatial variability of <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> not only at a catchment level but also at a national level, by means of statistical measures such as median and percentiles. This method revealed the dramatic differences in available dilution of chemicals both within and between countries, for example Canada has on average 4 -orders of magnitude more dilution available than Tunisia, and Finland 3 -orders of magnitude more than Spain. Over {{the course of a}} year, national dilution could vary between 10 and a 1000 -fold depending on the country. The work presented here is a significant step forward in terms of understanding the impact of river flow temporal variability on <b>dilution</b> <b>factors</b> at a national and global scale. The proposed methodology has great potential for scientists and decision makers across the globe, as it provides the means to improve screening-level chemical risk assessments...|$|R
