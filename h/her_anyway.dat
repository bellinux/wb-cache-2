5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly proves to be very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer <b>her</b> <b>anyway).</b> In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|Soraya {{is a young}} Afghan {{woman whom}} Amir meets and marries in the United States. Hosseini {{originally}} scripted the character as an American woman, but he later agreed to rewrite her as an Afghan immigrant after his editor did not find her background believable {{for her role in}} the story. The change contributed towards an extensive revision of Part III. In the final draft, Soraya lives with her parents, Afghan general Taheri and his wife, and wants to become an English teacher. Before meeting Amir, she ran away with an Afghan boyfriend in Virginia, which, according to Afghan tradition, made her unsuitable for marriage. Because Amir also had his own regrets, he loves and marries <b>her</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E

David asks Mary Margaret what is wrong and she admits she still has {{feelings}} for him, and he is the reason she goes to Granny's at 7:15. David replies that he goes to Granny's to see her.

25|$|Greenleaf married Baroness Antonia Cornelia Elbertine Scholten van Aschat et Oud-Haarlem in 1788. She was {{a member}} of a {{powerful}} Dutch banking family, and noble-born. Greenleaf said that, in 1796, he and the baroness made love soon after his arrival in Amsterdam. (He made it clear that neither had seduced the other.) When he returned to the United States, he learned she was pregnant. He claims he immediately returned to Amsterdam to marry her, and was told that she had miscarried. The van Aschat family convinced him to marry <b>her</b> <b>anyway,</b> and he did so in 1788. Greenleaf also says that his wife's maid soon revealed that there had been no pregnancy. By this time, the baroness was pregnant, and she gave birth to a son. Greenleaf says his wife later tried to commit suicide, after which he separated from her. During his brief marriage, Greenleaf communicated to Noah Webster how unhappy he was with the baroness.

25|$|However, as Lowell Cauffiel {{documents}} in his nonfiction book, friends, coworkers, {{family members and}} others who knew Graham and Wood told an entirely different story than the one Wood spun as the key witness in Graham's trial. They described Wood as both a coercive and seductive pathological liar who delighted in wreaking havoc {{in the lives of}} others. Forever and Five Days presents evidence that Wood planned the first murder after she found Graham with another woman. She involved Graham as an insurance policy to keep her from ever leaving her. When Graham left <b>her</b> <b>anyway</b> after the series of alleged killings, Wood was willing to put herself in legal jeopardy by disclosing to police to exact her revenge. The book portrays Wood as a psychopathic criminal mastermind who manipulated the prosecutor and the jury to punish Graham. Psychological testing also revealed Graham could be easily manipulated, suffered from borderline personality disorder and lacked the sophistication to plan the series of killings, let alone adequately defend herself in her trial.|$|E

500|$|After repairs were completed, she {{screened}} {{the heavy}} cruiser Lützow during her voyage to Trondheim 15–20 May 1942 and laid a minefield in the Skaggerak en route. Hans Lody was damaged when a valve was left open and flooded the starboard engine room in early June and required {{two weeks to}} be repaired. She {{was one of four}} destroyers assigned to escort the battleship [...] during Operation Rösselsprung (Knight's Move), an attack on the Russia-bound Convoy PQ 17. The ships sailed from Trondheim on 2 July for the first stage of the operation, although three of the destroyers, including Hans Lody, assigned to Tirpitzs escort ran aground in the dark and heavy fog and were forced to return to port for repairs. After temporary repairs, she was towed back to Kiel for permanent repairs on 25 July. Three days later the ships were attacked without effect by three Beaufort torpedo bombers. Korvettenkapitän Karl-Adolf Zenker assumed command in August. The dockyard estimated the time to repair Hans Lody at six months or more and the Kriegsmarine gave serious consideration to decommissioning her as uneconomical to repair, but was persuaded to repair <b>her</b> <b>anyway.</b>|$|E

The next morning, her presence was made apparent when [...] "Reveille" [...] was blown by a bugler and the dog began barking, hence Reveille became her name.

2500|$|While male {{prisoners were}} {{often used in}} single studies, so {{that the results of}} the {{experimentation}} on them would not be clouded by other variables, women were sometimes used in bacteriological or physiological experiments, sex experiments, and as the victims of sex crimes. The testimony of a unit member that served as guard graphically demonstrated this reality:"One of the former researchers I located told me that one day he had a human experiment scheduled, but there was still time to kill. So he and another unit member took the keys to the cells and opened one that housed a Chinese woman. One of the unit members raped her; the other member took the keys and opened another cell. There was a Chinese woman in there who had been used in a frostbite experiment. She had several fingers missing and her bones were black, with gangrene set in. He was about to rape <b>her</b> <b>anyway,</b> then he saw that her sex organ was festering, with pus oozing to the surface.
