This paper first {{establishes}} the graphic model and basic circuit equation of <b>dual</b> planetary <b>gear</b> transmission {{system based on}} modified complex joint picture representation method and basic circuit method. And then according to this model analyses the rotating relation and torque relation of <b>dual</b> planetary <b>gear</b> transmission system deduces the calculation formula of transmission rate efficiency. The sensitivity of each gear ratio to transmission efficiency is defined with the method of sensitivity analysis. By calculation and analysis, the influence degree of each gear ratio on transmission efficiency is obtained.

40|$|The article {{presents}} {{the numerical analysis}} {{of the impact of}} geometry errors on the motion transmission of <b>dual</b> path <b>gearing.</b> The strength calculations of the elements of the drive were made by means of the Finite Elements Method (FEM). The calculations were made for the two-dimensional models of the <b>dual</b> path <b>gearing.</b> In the first place, the drive of the error-free (theoretical) geometry was tested. Next, the modifications of the selected teeth were introduced to the calculation models. The aim of the modifications of the tooth profile was to simulate pitch errors in compliance with the admissible values defined by PN-ISO 1328 - 1 : 2015 norm “Cylindrical gears - ISO system of flank tolerance classification”. Finally, all the results were put together for comparison. The obtained results confirm the high irregularity of work gear as a result of errors tooth geometry...|$|R
50|$|The gearbox {{of the car}} {{was also}} novel, having <b>dual</b> {{epicyclic}} <b>gears</b> and being bolted directly to the engine. This allowed four speeds, with direct drive in top gear. All the gears were helical, and enclosed in an oil bath, making for very silent transmission. Reverse gear was built into the rear axle, as was the foot operated brake drum, all of which was housed in a substantial aluminium casing.|$|R
40|$|Fishing {{trials to}} {{investigate}} the effectiveness of separator trawls in the local Nephrops fishery were carried out by two Stornoway vessels using parallel haul techniques. A two-level separator trawl towed alongside commercial <b>dual</b> purpose <b>gears</b> matched them haul for haul in landings of both Nephrops and finfish. The reduction in roundfish discards, expected from using a larger mesh size in the upper codend of the separator trawl, proved disappointing. Further trials are proposed to examine and improve the selectivity of the separator trawl...|$|R
50|$|Ford's new 6-speed 6R75 {{intelligent}} {{automatic transmission}} with <b>dual</b> overdrive <b>gears</b> was introduced. The transmission featured push-button overdrive lock-out, electronic shift scheduling, adaptive shift algorithms and a mechatronic {{transmission control module}} (TCM) that would save adaptive shift data in keep alive memory (KAM). This safeguarded against complete data loss {{in case of a}} power failure (such as disconnecting the battery). In the event of a power failure, the mechatronic unit would simply read the last saved data entry from the system's memory, thus, the transmission did not have to completely relearn the owner's driving style.|$|R

5000|$|Franklin then {{designed}} the 1920 Scout, a mid-sized motorcycle with a [...] engine. Design improvements over Indian's larger motorcycles included a gearbox {{bolted to the}} engine and driven by helical-cut gears instead of a primary chain. Franklin's 1922 Indian Chief used a larger version of the Scout's drivetrain design. Compared to the Powerplus-powered motorcycle it replaced, the Chief had <b>dual</b> camshafts, <b>gear</b> drive {{similar to that of}} the Scout, and a wet clutch. After designing the 1925 Indian Prince, a single-cylinder [...] lightweight motorcycle which preceded Harley-Davidson's equivalent single-cylinder models by one year [...] Franklin generally approved Arthur Lemon's development of the Ace four-cylinder motorcycle design, which Indian acquired in 1927, and he re{{designed the}} Scout for 1928. The resulting Indian 401 four-cylinder motorcycle and Indian 101 Scout had the same frame geometry, which, in the lighter 101 Scout, resulted in exceptional handling and stability. Franklin later designed a three-wheeled utility vehicle, the 1931 Dispatch Tow, based on the Model 101 frame.|$|R
50|$|The GT250R comes stock with a 249 cc V-twin engine. The Hyosung V-twin {{engine was}} {{designed}} in Hamamatsu Japan by a design team consisting of engineers who have previously {{worked in the}} research and development teams of Suzuki. Technical features include roller bearing camshafts, two-piece spring dampened bevel silent primary drive <b>gears,</b> <b>dual</b> squish combustion chambers. It utilizes a DOHC eight-valve engine configuration. Twin downdraft Mikuni carburetors were standard until 2008, when fuel injection became available. Cycle World tested the GT250R's acceleration at 0 to 60 mph in 7.6 seconds and 0 to 1/4 mi in 16.06 seconds at 80.09 mph.|$|R
50|$|The <b>dual</b> {{crankshafts}} are <b>geared</b> {{directly to}} the clutch, while the front crankshaft also drives a counter balancer shaft mounted between the two crankshafts. The counterbalance shaft, unusual on a two-stroke, assists with damping engine vibrations. The engine is cooled by thermostatically controlled liquid cooling, an auxiliary electric fan mounted behind the radiator cuts in at quite high but acceptable working temperatures (e.g. when stationary in traffic).Lubrication is by direct injection into the inlet manifolds using Yamaha's 'Autolube' pump system. Normally controlled in other two-stroke engines by throttle position, the engine oil pump {{is controlled by the}} YPVS servo motor ensuring that the oil supply is not shut off at high engine revolutions.|$|R
40|$|In recent years, {{increasing}} {{concerns regarding}} environmental pollution and requirements for lower {{fossil fuel consumption}} have increased interest in alternative hybrid powertrains. As a result, this paper presents a novel hydraulic/electric synergy powertrain with multiple working modes. The three energy sources (i. e., engine, battery, and hydraulic accumulator) in this configuration are regulated by a <b>dual</b> planetary <b>gear</b> set to achieve optimal performances. This paper selects the component sizes of a hybrid electric vehicle (HEV), a hydraulic hybrid vehicle (HHV), and a hydraulic/electric synergy vehicle (HESV), based on the dynamic performance of a target vehicle (TV). In addition, this paper develops the forward simulation models of the four aforementioned vehicles in the MATLAB/Simulink/Driveline platform, in which the fuel economy simulations are carried out {{in relation to the}} Chinese urban bus cycle. The simulation results show that the fuel consumption of the three hybrid vehicles is similar, but much better than, that of the TV. Finally, based on the operating cost calculations over a five-year working period, the lowest cost ranges of the three hybrid vehicles are determined, which provides a method for choosing the optimal hybrid scheme...|$|R
50|$|Tatra {{differentials}} are {{a unique}} design that uses two opposing {{spiral bevel gears}} {{instead of the usual}} single set. The differential gears are part of the input drive shaft rather than between the output axles as in a conventional differential. All versions of the Tatra differential have locking pins that can force the differential gears to rotate together, “locking” the differential. This arrangement had two distinct advantages. The first is that the <b>dual</b> output bevel <b>gears</b> allow the axles to swing around the drive axle without the need for universal couplings. The second is that the input drive shaft goes essentially straight through the differential housing, allowing simple coupling to a second set of swing axles. This modular design enables configurations of 2, 3, 4, 5, or even 6 axles with all axles driven. The whole assembly is part of the backbone frame.|$|R
50|$|The Berkut is {{descended from}} the Rutan Long-EZ, with the primary {{differences}} being retractable main landing <b>gear,</b> <b>dual</b> canopies, and molded fuselage, strakes, and spar. Like the Long EZ, the Berkut carries 2 people in tandem seats. The front seat occupant has access to all instrumentation and controls. The rear seat, normally holding the passenger, {{is equipped with a}} side stick and throttle, but no rudder pedals, brakes, or instruments. Aerodynamically, optimizations to the original Long-EZ airframe were made to increase performance and interior space. The fuselage was stretched, and the nose, canard, instrument panel and pilot moved forward one foot, to allow a heavier engine {{to be used in the}} back. The main wing trailing edge was straightened, removing a small bend in the trailing edge of the Long EZ wing. The lower winglet was removed and the aileron size increased in both chord and span, significantly increasing roll rate.|$|R
40|$|Satellites {{must often}} point a device {{continuously}} at an object while the satellite and/or object move through space. With these devices, connections are typically {{made between the}} articulated device and a fixed base around which the device rotates {{in one or more}} axes while tracking. Implementing these connections can be a challenge in size constrained applications or when uninterrupted tracking is required. Within the small satellite realm, some new solutions (e. g., Canfield joint) have recently been developed to address this problem. Given the mass and volume constraints imposed upon CubeSats, the authors feel that none of the existing solutions solve the problem elegantly or efficiently. A new, simple two degree-of-freedom (2 -DOF) joint - the Hemispherical Anti-Twist Tracking System (HATTS) - is proposed that allows continuous tracking through a hemisphere with continuous rotation while avoiding any twist in the connection(s) from the device to the base. This design is notable for its simplicity and its ability to continuously rotate. The HATTS joint has a reduced component count and fewer interfaces between moving parts than other solutions, thereby potentially increasing pointing accuracy while lowering cost, mass and complexity. In the CubeSat-specific implementation (CubeHATTS), two identical motors are rigidly affixed to the chassis of the satellite and provide the two DOFs via a jointed elevation arm and <b>dual</b> coaxial <b>gears</b> operated either synchronously or differentially. CubeHATTS is able to track continuously through a hemisphere and when stowed, the entire system fits in a volume of approximately ¼ U (10 cm x 10 cm x 2. 8 cm) ...|$|R
40|$|Current {{landing gear}} {{mechanism}} analysis methods focus on determining purely geometric behaviour of the retraction mechanism, {{to ensure that}} the landing gear will meet its stowed constraints. For detailed analysis work, dynamic simulation is the standard method to determine underlying causes of nonlinear behaviour. The work presented in this thesis provides an alternative analysis approach for analysing quasi-static landing gear mechanisms, to be used to complement and inform the use of dynamic simulations. This alternative method of investigating quasi-static mechanisms is first presented for two planar mechanism example cases: an overcentre mechanism and a nose landing gear mechanism. The method uses static equilibrium equations along with equations describing the geometric constraints in the mechanism. In the spirit of bifurcation analysis, solutions to these steady-state equations are then continued numerically in parameters of interest. Results obtained from the numerical continuation agree with the equivalent results obtained from two overcentre mechanism dynamic models, whilst offering a considerable computation time reduction. The analysis performed with the nose landing gear model demonstrates the flexibility of the continuation approach, allowing conventional model states to be used as continuation parameters without a need to reformulate the equations within the model. The modelling approach is then demonstrated for the case of non-planar landing gear mechanisms, with application to a three-dimensional aircraft main landing gear mechanism model. A design case-study is performed on the landing gear actuator position to demonstrate the potential industrial relevance of the method. The trade-off between maximal efficiency and peak actuator force reduction when positioning the actuator is investigated. The problem formulation allows actuator force, length and efficiency information to be obtained from a single numerical continuation run with minimal data post-processing. Finally, a model of a <b>dual</b> sidestay landing <b>gear</b> mechanism is, presented and used to investigate the mechanism downlock sensitivity to attachment point deflections. Motivation for this study is provided by a desire to understand the underlying nonlinear behaviour that may prevent a <b>dual</b> sidestay landing <b>gear</b> from down- locking under certain conditions. An investigation into the effect of sidestay angle reveals that the geometry prevents the gear from fully retracting at certain sidestay angles. Sidestay flexi- bilities are then introduced to enable the downlock loads to be investigated. It is demonstrated that deflections of even a few milimetres can provide a force barrier to the landing gear down- locking. The underlying nonlinear behaviour is attributed to the formation of double hysteresis loop in the force-locklink angle plane. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|The {{inspection}} {{of each individual}} tooth element of a spur gear wheel can be a tedious and expensive process. Two methods of composite gear testing are available, namely, the single flank rolling gear test and the <b>dual</b> flank rolling <b>gear</b> test. The first method is well documented, but the dual flank system tends to have been neglected, few papers being available on the subject. As a preliminary stage to {{the investigation into the}} dual flank testing technique two methods of pitch error measurement using ball ended contact probes are examined. These are :(i) the direct measurement of cumulative pitch measurement using a single contact probe and dividing arrangement and(ii) the span gauging of adjacent teeth, commercial measuring equipment being used in both cases. The two methods are compared theoretically in terms of the maximum cumulative pitch error of a gear, and their probable accuracy of measurement compared with the allowable pitch tolerances quoted in the relevant British Standard. Specifications, a theory for the dual flank test is developed relating the variation in centre distance of a pair of gears in close mesh to the errors in tooth pitch and involute profile. The validity of the theory- is tested by experimental measurements, on actual gears, and- a means of determining the permissible variation in the dual flank test error trace from the allowable tolerances on tooth pitch error and tooth profile error suggested. The identification of the type of elemental error from the pattern of the dual flank trace is also examined together with the limitations of the test...|$|R
40|$|In most {{serviceability}} conditions, concrete structures present quasi-brittle {{behavior and}} failure {{due to the}} presence of a nonlinear fracture process zone ahead of the crack front. Predictive models and design methodologies {{have to be able to}} reliably calculate the load capacity, or structural strength, of structures while taking into account the nonlinearity of the material behavior and the consideration of realistic boundary conditions such as geometry, size, and loading configuration. The main objective of this study is to develop models and to apply numerical tools to predict the cracking potential in three-dimensional concrete structures. Firstly, a cohesive zone model is formulated and implemented to simulate mode I crack growth in quasi-brittle materials based on the thermodynamics of irreversible processes allowing for loading, unloading, and re-loading. The model is a step forward to improve existing cohesive zone formulations to consider three-dimensional geometries and also overcome numerical instability, lack of convergence, and oscillations in the traction profile commonly reported in cohesive models. This study also explores the novel computational framework of the generalized finite element method (GFEM) to predict the potential for crack propagation in large scale problems such as three-dimensional airfield concrete slabs. A multi-scale approach, using the global-local concept within the GFEM framework (GFEMg-l), is applied to multi-site damage problems (MSD), where several crack geometries are placed simultaneously at different positions in a slab and loaded by different aircraft gears. This approach efficiently simulates multiple cracks not discretized in the global mesh, but only modeled in the local problem domains. The GFEMg-l enrichment functions allow the kinematics to be represented in the global domain through enrichment function from the local problems rather than explicitly modeling each crack discretely in the global domain. This research effort also proposes an integrated approach called nonlinear strength fracture model (NLSFM) to predict the structural strength or load capacity of three-dimensional concrete structures considering the structure geometry, loading configuration, and the nonlinearities ahead of the crack front. In this approach, the extraction of crack front quantities, such as stress intensity factors, are performed through finite element analysis, and then a high-order approximation based on the equivalent elastic crack approach for quasi-brittle materials accounts for the FPZ effects on the nominal strength of the structure under mode I fracture. The NLSFM uses the size- and shape-independent fracture properties defined through the critical energy release rate, Gf, and size of fracture process zone, c (as provided by the two-parameter fracture model and size effect model for quasi-brittle materials). As a result, the model predicts a material independent strength-curve, given the structural geometry, boundary conditions, loading, initial crack length are computationally defined through a pre-defined geometric function for the three-dimensional structure of interest. The model is validated with large scale slab tests predicting the ultimate load for cracked and uncracked slabs test setups. The NLSFM advances the state-of-the-art of computational modeling of failure in quasi-brittle materials, currently limited to 2 -D structures or laboratory test specimens, to large scale 3 -D problems with realistic boundary conditions and loading configurations. The proposed numerical tools are used as a computational platform to analyze the cracking potential for airfield concrete slabs with existing surface- and bottom-initiated cracks. The results show that starter cracks can induce unstable crack propagation under specific loading configurations and material fracture properties. Given existing surface and bottom starter cracks of the same geometry in the concrete slabs, it was much easier to propagate surface cracks under triple <b>dual</b> tandem <b>gear</b> loading relative to the traditional design assumption that bottom-up fatigue cracks are the critical failure mode for airfield concrete slabs...|$|R
5000|$|In 1997, Honda {{introduced}} the NSX's biggest performance upgrades {{for all its}} worldwide markets. Engine displacement increased from 3.0 L to 3.2 L using a thinner fiber-reinforced metal (FRM) cylinder liner. The exhaust manifold was reconfigured and made of stainless steel header pipes rather than a cast-iron manifold for improved performance and lighter weight. The increased flow from this new configuration was a key contributor to the 20 additional horsepower drawn from the new engine. This revised 3.2 L C32B engine gave it slightly more rated power: from [...] to [...] while torque increased from 285 Nm to 305 Nm (manual transmission only). The net result increased the horsepower to weight ratio of the NSX by 7%. The 4-speed automatic model retained its 3.0 L engine and 252 hp power output. Another big change was {{the adoption of a}} 6-speed manual transmission with closer gear ratios and the addition of 3rd to 4th <b>gear</b> <b>dual</b> cone synchronizers. To handle the new engine's added torque and power the small diameter twin-disc clutch system of the 5-speed was replaced by a dual-mass low-inertia single disc clutch system. To offset the weight increase of the new 6-speed transmission and larger brake rotors, which were upped from 11.1 in to 11.732 in, key body parts were made with a new aluminum alloy that was up to 50% stronger allowing thinner lighter material {{to be used in the}} doors, fenders, and front and rear deck lids without any sacrifice of strength. Using this hi-strength alloy the net curb weight increase, despite adding many improvements, was only 22 lbs. Other notable changes included a keyless entry system and vehicle immobilizer system. The combination of slightly increased power and torque and a 6-speed gearbox, with ratios optimized to improve straight-line acceleration, produced better performance numbers over previous models than the modest increases would suggest. Motor Trend and Road and Track (Feb 97) tests of 3.2L 6-speed equipped NSX-T (Targa) roofed cars produced 0-60 mph times of 4.8 and 5.0 seconds and quarter-mile times of 13.3s and 13.5s respectively. 0-60 mph times dropped to as low as 4.5 seconds using a 3.2L hard top coupe model as recorded by Car and Driver in their August 1998 0-150-0 issue. That NSX proved to be the fastest ever tested in North America. When Car and Driver tested the 1999 Zanardi special edition coupe a year later it produced a 4.8s 0-60 and a 13.2s quarter-mile. Although magazine tests for the 02+ models were rare Honda apparently kept improving the engine as Sports and Exotic Car magazine did a farewell article on a 2005 NSX-T and recorded a 0-60 time of 4.7s and a 13.1s quarter-mile.|$|R
