Now it was of my acquaintance, that inasmuch as God had let me be born a prince, such as I then am born, then my good and my destruction were knotted into one with the common good; for every reason then, it was now my promise that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> great pains about their well-being and good governance and management, and thereabout bear close concern.|$|E
500|$|... "Lemme See" [...] is a mid-tempo R {{song that}} heavily {{incorporates}} synthesizers, {{and has a}} running duration of four minutes and 15 seconds. It contains elements of hip hop music, and its production was compared {{to the one in}} Kelly Rowland's [...] "Motivation" [...] (2011). Lyrically, Usher is contemplating on what he is going to do when he [...] "gets a certain female clubgoer into his bedroom", in the line: Hey girl, I’m debating if <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> you home. During the pre-chorus, he comes to the conclusion: I decided to take my shirt off / and show my chest.|$|E

However, Trescothick pulled {{himself out of the}} squad before the final confirmation date, stating that [...] " [...] now clear that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> more time to complete my recovery". The England selectors confirmed that they remained in favour of including Trescothick at some point, looking [...] "forward to his making himself available again for England when the time is right". Trescothick, however, said that he knows England cannot wait for him forever, and on 10 September 2007 he went into his second year without an England contract.|$|E

500|$|Pavelić and his {{followers}} intended to create an [...] "ethnically pure" [...] Croatia through the mass murder and deportation of Serbs, Jews and other non-Croats. Only about {{fifty percent of the}} NDH's 6.2 million inhabitants were Croat. Nearly two million Serbs, about one-third of the NDH's total population, now found themselves within the borders of the newly formed state. In addition, Serb-majority areas covered between 60 and 70 percent of the NDH's total landmass. [...] "The Croatian state cannot exist if 1.8 million Serbs are living in it and if we have a powerful Serbian state at our backs," [...] Croatia's future Foreign Minister Mladen Lorković explained. [...] "Therefore, we are trying to make the Serbs disappear from our regions." [...] Dido Kvaternik, a senior Ustaše official, was entrusted with [...] "cleansing" [...] Bjelovar and its surroundings. The younger Kvaternik recalled: [...] "When we triumphantly returned home from abroad and when Pavelić decided that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> over the implementation of the measures against Serbs and Jews, I obeyed immediately and without hesitation because I knew that this question had to be resolved {{for the future of the}} Croatian people and state, and that someone had to make the sacrifice so that these odious but necessary measures could be carried out." [...] Pavelić's orders for the extermination of non-Croats in and around Bjelovar were likely delivered orally to ensure that no written evidence remained.|$|E
2500|$|Brandeis {{was unusual}} among lawyers since he always turned away cases he {{considered}} bad. If he believed a client {{to be in}} the wrong, he would persuade his clients to make amends, otherwise he would withdraw from the case. Once, uncertain as to the rightness of his client's case, he wrote the client, [...] "The position that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> if I remained in the case would be to give everybody a square deal." ...|$|E

He enrolled in Madras Agricultural College ( [...] now the Tamil Nadu Agricultural University [...] ) where he graduated as valedictorian with another Bachelor of Science degree, this time in Agricultural Science. He explained this career decision thus: [...] "My personal motivation started with the great , when I was a student at the University of Kerala. There was an acute rice shortage, and in Bengal about 3 million people died from starvation. All of our young people, myself included, were involved in the freedom struggle, which Gandhi had intensified, and I decided <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> to agricultural research in order to help farmers produce more." ...|$|E

2500|$|... and his {{obituary}} in the January 5, 2002 {{issue of}} UK's Kerrang! magazine said that [...] "Chuck Schuldiner {{was one of}} the most significant figures in the history of metal." [...] Schuldiner himself was modest about his part in the history of death metal, noting, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band." [...] Schuldiner was ranked No. 10 in Joel McIver's book The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists in 2009 and No. 20 in March 2004 Guitar World's [...] "The 100 Greatest Metal Guitarists". Schuldiner founded the publishing company Mutilation Music in 1987, affiliated with performance rights organization BMI.|$|E
2500|$|Turner {{also had}} an {{influence}} over white people. In the case of Ethelred T. Brantley, Turner {{said that he was}} able to convince Brantley to [...] "cease from his wickedness". By the spring of 1828, Turner was convinced that he [...] "was ordained for some great purpose in the hands of the Almighty". While working in his owner's fields on May 12, Turner [...] "heard a loud noise in the heavens, and the Spirit instantly appeared to me and said the Serpent was loosened, and Christ had laid down the yoke he had borne for the sins of men, and that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> it on and fight against the Serpent, for the time was fast approaching when the first should be last and the last should be first".|$|E
2500|$|Richthofen {{had arrived}} in Luneberg on 12 April, ready for a four-week period of leave. On 18 April he {{received}} a call from the Luftwaffe's Chief of the General Staff Hans Jeschonnek who informed him he was to leave for Kerch immediately. He commented in his diary, [...] "By order of the Führer, I must immediately leave again, to work at Kerch. Get there quickly and get everything started! Formal orders still to come". After meeting Hitler he wrote, [...] "The Fuhrer insisted in a very respectful manner that <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> part at Kerch, because I'm the only person who can do the job". Hitler had a high opinion of Richthofen and believed the Corps' record, as a specialised close-support force, was unparalleled and would guarantee success. Richthofen was arrogant, aggressive and harsh, but he was a driven, pro-active, successful and influential tactical air commander.|$|E

2500|$|Death is {{considered}} {{to be one of the}} most influential bands in heavy metal and a pioneering force in death metal. Scream Bloody Gore is widely regarded as the first death metal album, and Schuldiner is acknowledged as the originator of extreme metal. Music biographer Garry Sharpe-Young considered Death [...] "a genre-breaking band centered upon frontman Chuck Schuldiner" [...] and that the band [...] "would become one of the prime instigators of the death metal movement". However, Schuldiner dismissed such attributions by stating, in an interview with Metal-Rules.com, [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>should</b> <b>take</b> the credits for this death metal stuff. I'm just a guy from a band, and I think Death is a metal band". In Death's later music, the band's music became more technical, moving to a more technical death metal style. In January 2001, Mahyar Dean, an Iranian musician, wrote Death, a book about Death and Schuldiner and released it in Iran. The book includes bilingual lyrics and many articles about the band. The book was sent through the site keepers of emptywords.org to Schuldiner, who in his words was [...] "truly blown away and extremely honored by the obvious work and devotion he put into bringing the book to life".|$|E
