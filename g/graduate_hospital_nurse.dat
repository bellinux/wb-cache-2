50|$|Zefania Kiganda had {{the rare}} {{opportunity}} of {{sitting at the}} feet of Sir Albert Ruskin Cook when the latter traversed that part of the country treating and teaching the locals hygiene and medical skills. Zefania Kiganda had a short stint at Mengo Hospital Medical School from where he graduated as a Medical Assistant. He was later posted to Kako, Masaka at the CMS Hospital to do his internship from January 1919 to August 1920, and he was specifically attached to the Dispensary from where he learnt more about the dispensing of various common drugs. He was closely supervised by the Rev. Dr A. Clarke who in turn wrote a recommendation letter about Zefania Kiganda to the other various CMS health centers, enabling the latter to carry out his medical practice. Zefania Kiganda traversed very many areas in Buddu, Kooki and Kabula treating and training locals in hygiene and medical skills. He chose to settle on Kako Hill from where he wedded his long time friend Victoria, a young <b>graduate</b> from Mengo <b>Hospital</b> <b>Nursing</b> School. Victoria was niece to Sir Apolo Kagwa and having grown up in the aristocratic home of the Buganda Katikiro (Prime Minister) of Buganda, she had the most rare of opportunities to go to Gayaza High School and thereafter to Mengo <b>Hospital</b> <b>Nursing</b> School, from where she graduated as a Nursing Officer.

40|$|Study objectives: To {{determine}} {{the relationship between}} consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> toward demented elderly 	 patients with critical illness and care toward delirium, and to examine caring for the protecting delirium. 	Design: Grounded theory approach. 	Setting: An acute ward in the geriatrics hospital and acute wards including ICU in the general hospital in A city. 	Participants: The study population consisted of 11 nurses working for acute wards in the hospitals. 	Results: Consciousness of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> related to delirium of demented geriatric patients with critical illness was 	 discovered in 3 categories and 10 subcategories, and 3 categories were mutually related. In this study, 	 communication formed acceptance process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> were found. The demented elderly patients have 	 increased risks {{for the development of}} delirium and outcomes related to communication and circumstance which is 	 prevalent to ICU. While outcomes suggest that communication and circumstance are not merely risk factors for 	 adjusting for severity of illness, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should notice patients' needs when providing critical care. 	 Additionally, acceptant process of <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> showed emotional response. 	Conclusions: In this study, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> made therapy prior to any others. Delirium of demented old patients are 	 associated with complications and increased less likelihood of family support after recovery. Caring of critically ill elderly demented patients involved understanding of changing sign or cues. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> should focus on how 	 to best care for protecting delirium, not see the illness, but watch on the human who has illness...|$|R

40|$|Dying is {{a process}} {{composed}} of three consequential phases. It starts with the pre-dying period {{then there is the}} dying period and it is finished by the post - mortem period. Every period has its own specificity and <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> {{have to be able to}} look after a person passing through the successive dying periods, and they have to percive him/her as a holistic being including his/her biological, psychological, social and spiritual needs that also have to be satisfied. Even in the post - mortem period a dead patient has the right to be treated with regard and respect. The most important link in all the periods is communication with both the dying patient and his/her family and the survivors after his/her death. The target of the thesis was to find out how <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> perceive taking care of a dying person in hospitals and how <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> look after a dead body. The following research questions were stated: How is the dying period perceived by <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses?</b> What obstructions in communication are there between <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> and survivors? How do <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> look after dead bodies? To figure out the investigation the method of qualitative research with the use of depth interview was used. The respondents were willing to record the interviews which were verbally - rewritten and then subjected to the contents analysis by the method paper and pencil. From the research it is clear that <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> can cope with dying and death. However, taking care of dying people is not easy. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> try to comfort the dying and satisfy their biological, psychological and social needs. But it is an alarming discovery that no spiritul needs are satisfied at all. Taking care of a dying person also involves communication with his/her family, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> try to meet all the wishes and needs. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> do not use touching and listening while communicating with a dying patient, they do not even mention the stages by Elisabeth Kübler - Ross. The lack of time and suitable premises inhibits nurses from communication with survivors. Besides the form "Information for survivors" which includes the necessary details of arranging funerals and hospital social worker´s telephone number, <b>hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> do not provide any information, they do not even have any knowledge how to conduct survivors. <b>Hospital</b> <b>nurses</b> take care of dead bodies with regard and respect in terms of hospital standard. Care is provided in the room itself, if there is the lack of space, a screen is used so that other patients can not see the dead body. Survivors can part with the dead patient in the hospital room. There is no special room for that purpose. More than half of respondents is not educated in the field of dying and death any longer. On the basis of the research investigation and after the consultation with the senior nursing officer the training course will be organized. The topic of the training course will concentrate on the dying period and death with intent to the stages by Elisabeth Kübler - Ross, spiritual needs of dying patients, ways of communication with dying patients and how to conduct survivors. The form "Information for survivors" will be supplied with further information which can help survivors cope with the difficult situation that has occured. Other discovered facts, for example, the lack of suitable premises, time and staff can not be influenced by the respondents, but it could surely be influenced by the hospital management...|$|R
