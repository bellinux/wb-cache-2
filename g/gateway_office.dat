50|$|International calling After World War II, {{priority}} {{was given by}} AT&T in the USA and the various PTT entities in Europe to automating switching on the toll networks in their respective countries (initially for Operator Toll Dialing). Thus, when TAT-1 was opened for service, it was connected to international <b>gateway</b> <b>offices</b> at White Plains, NY and London that were already automated for domestic calls. These were designed {{to be able to}} automatically switch outward and inward international circuits as soon as common signalling standards (and political considerations) could be negotiated. However, at the outset, to set up an international call, multiple operators were required: one to originate the call and one at each national gateway to complete a call via either ringdown to a local operator or operator toll dialing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{key to the}} {{new system}} was {{two-stage}} multi-frequency pulsing. The outgoing sender sent its Class 4 toll center an off-hook signal as usual, received a wink as usual as a [...] "proceed to send" [...] signal, and outpulsed only a special 3-digit (later 6-digit) access code. The toll center picked a trunk through the long distance network to the <b>gateway</b> <b>office,</b> which sent a second wink to the originating office, which then sent the whole dialed number. Thus the toll switching system needed no modification except at the gateway. The international trunks used Signaling System No. 5, a [...] "North Atlantic" [...] version of the North American multi-frequency signaling system, with minor modifications including slightly higher digit rate. European MF systems of the time used compelled signalling, which would slow down too much on a long transoceanic connection.|$|E
50|$|In the 1960s, {{with the}} {{domestic}} conversion still underway, plans were laid to extend Direct Dialing beyond North America and its nearby islands. With so much new equipment already working {{that could only}} handle ten digit phone numbers, a system was devised by which most toll offices {{did not have to}} store and forward the whole international phone number. <b>Gateway</b> <b>offices</b> were set up in New York, London and Paris, connected to the ordinary automatic toll network. The New York gateway was at 32 Avenue of the Americas. The new LT1 5XB switch on the tenth floor of 435 West 50th Street received new Originating Registers and Outgoing Senders able to handle 15 digit telephone numbers, with appropriate modifications to Completing Markers and other equipment. Other 5XB {{in the next few years}} were installed with IDDD as original equipment, and in the 1970s ESS offices also provided the service.|$|R

50|$|Gateway {{was named}} for a {{depression}} in the terrain north of Madras formed by the erosion of Trout Creek and its tributaries, which created a natural gateway for north-south railroad and vehicular traffic through Central Oregon.

25|$|In {{the early}} 1950s, {{the cities of}} New Jersey began {{experiencing}} urban decay.

40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of our audit of financial accountability in the Gateway District (Project Number 09 BD 022 FF 000). This audit was self-initiated and addresses financial risk. The objective of our audit was to determine whether internal controls over stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; employee items; and disbursements at the selected sites were in place and effective. See Appendix A for additional information about this audit. Conclusion We visited five <b>Gateway</b> District post <b>offices</b> and stations with high-risk accounting activities according to our PARIS Cost and Controls model. We identified internal control and compliance issues at these sites related to stamp, cash, and money order accountabilities; financial differences; 1 employee items; and disbursements. In addition, we identified similar issues at five other sites in the Gateway District that we audited during fiscal year (FY) 2009. 2 We attribute these internal control deficiencies to an insufficient district-wide monitoring program that identified high-risk offices but did not hold unit managers accountable for implementing and documenting corrective actions. As a result, <b>Gateway</b> District post <b>offices,</b> stations, and branches are at an increased risk of losing cash, accountable items, and revenue without detection; and misstating financial records. We identified $ 171, 000 in monetary impact and approximately $ 1. 9 million in non-monetary impact as a result of unit managers not effectively implementing internal controls. 1 Financial differences are unreconciled expense entries that must be researched and resolved in a timely manner...|$|R
