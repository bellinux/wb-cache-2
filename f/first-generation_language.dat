50|$|A first {{generation}} (programming) language (1GL) is a grouping of programming languages that are machine level languages used to program first-generation computers. Originally, no translator {{was used to}} compile or assemble the <b>first-generation</b> <b>language.</b> The first-generation programming instructions were entered through the front panel switches of the computer system.|$|E
50|$|A <b>first-generation</b> {{programming}} <b>language</b> (1GL) is a machine-level programming language.|$|R
50|$|The {{term was}} coined {{to provide a}} {{distinction}} from higher level third-generation programming languages (3GL) such as COBOL and earlier <b>first-generation</b> programming <b>language</b> (machine code languages).|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{programs for}} stored-program computers were entered in binary {{through the front}} panel switches of the computer. This <b>first-generation</b> programming <b>language</b> had no distinction between source code and machine code.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{computers were}} often programmed {{without the help}} of a programming language, by writing programs in absolute machine language. The programs, in decimal or binary form, were read in from punched cards or magnetic tape or toggled in on switches on the front panel of the computer. Absolute machine languages were later termed <b>first-generation</b> programming <b>languages</b> (1GL).|$|R
40|$|This basic interpretive study {{investigated}} the literacy experiences of seven <b>first-generation</b> Haitian English <b>language</b> learners. During interviews and focus groups, participants expressed ambivalent feelings toward Creole and French and explained how their knowledge of these languages supported their English language learning...|$|R
40|$|A {{wide range}} of aspect-oriented {{programming}} languages {{has appeared in the}} past years [7]. Current research on future generation AOP languages is addressing issues like flexibility, expressive power and safety. We think {{that it is important to}} understand the motivations and design decisions of the first generation AOP languages. The composition filters model [1, 7, 12] is one example of such a <b>first-generation</b> AOP <b>language.</b> The goal of this chapter is two-fold: first, it aims at explaining the principles of composition filters, in particular its aspect-oriented composition capabilities. Second, we aim to provide insight into the motivations and design rationale decisions behind the composition filters model...|$|R
40|$|This article {{summarizes}} {{the origins of}} informatics, {{which is based on}} the science, engineering, and technology of computer hardware, software, and communications. In just four decades, from the 1950 s to the 1990 s, computer technology has progressed from slow, first-generation vacuum tubes, through the invention of the transistor and its incorporation into microprocessor chips, and ultimately, to fast, fourth-generation very-large-scale-integrated silicon chips. Programming has undergone a parallel transformation, from cumbersome, <b>first-generation,</b> machine <b>languages</b> to efficient, fourth-generation application-oriented languages. Communication has evolved from simple copper wires to complex fiberoptic cables in computer-linked networks. The digital computer has profound implications for the development and practice of clinical medicine...|$|R
30|$|The authors’ article “Bitcoin and the Rise of Decentralized Autonomous Organizations” {{performs}} the welcome service of highlighting for organization theorists how so-called cryptocurrencies (more properly, tokens) are at root about organizing, not about money. We are living through {{an era of}} ferment in token technology. Bitcoin itself is unlikely to become the dominant design for tokens because its design limits {{the speed at which}} transactions can be confirmed and registered. (A typical credit card network can process about 1500 times as many transactions per second.) A superior alternative has already emerged that enables “smart contracts,” although its <b>first-generation</b> programming <b>language</b> will likely be superseded many times, just as COBOL gave way to more advanced tools for computing.|$|R
30|$|Types of {{discrimination}} are usually distinguished by economic theory in statistical and taste-based. Using a correspondence experiment, we analyze {{which of the}} two affects Italian labor market the most. In this respect, we studied the difference in discrimination reserved to first- and second-generation immigrants, taking gender differences into account. Even if we want to admit a rational discrimination based on perceived productivity differences (statistical discrimination) against <b>first-generation</b> immigrants (concerning <b>language</b> and education gaps), the same would not be reasonable for second-generation ones. Since they are born and educated in Italy, where they have always lived, the associated discrimination must be taste-based.|$|R
5000|$|Saul Bellow, also quoting Anthony Burgess: [...] "Well, we were here, <b>first-generation</b> Americans, our <b>{{language}}</b> was English and {{a language}} is a spiritual mansion from which no one can evict us. Malamud in his novels and stories discovered a sort of communicative genius in the impoverished, harsh jargon of immigrant New York. He was a myth maker, a fabulist, a writer of exquisite parables. The English novelist Anthony Burgess said of him that he 'never forgets {{that he is an}} American Jew, and he is at his best when posing the situation of a Jew in urban American society.' 'A remarkably consistent writer,' he goes on, 'who has never produced a mediocre novel .... He is devoid of either conventional piety or sentimentality ... always profoundly convincing.' Let me add on my own behalf that the accent of hard-won and individual emotional truth is always heard in Malamud's words. He is a rich original of the first rank."Bellow's eulogy to Malamud, 1986 ...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} {{size and}} complexity of software, coupled with concurrency and distributed systems, has made apparent the ineffectiveness of using only handcrafted tests. The misuse of code coverage and avoidance of random testing has exacerbated the problem. We must start again, beginning with good design (including dependency analysis), good static checking (including model property checking), and good unit testing (including good input selection). Code coverage can help select and prioritize tests to make you more efficient, as can the all-pairs technique for controlling the number of configurations. Finally, testers can use models to generate test coverage and good stochastic tests, and to act as test oracles. HANDCRAFTED TESTS OUTPACED BY HARDWARE AND SOFTWARE Hardware advances have followed Moore’s law for years, giving the capability for running ever-more complex software on the same cost platform. Developers {{have taken advantage of}} this by raising their level of abstraction from assembly to <b>first-generation</b> compiled <b>languages</b> to managed code such as C # and Java, and rapid application development environments such as Visual Basic. Although the number of lines of code per day per programmer appears to remain relatively fixed, the power of each line of code has increased, allowing complex systems to be built. Moore’s law provides double the computing power every 18 months and software code size tends to double every seven years, but software testing {{does not appear to be}} keeping pace. TOO DARNED Testing large systems is a daunting task, but there are steps we can take to ease the pain...|$|R
25|$|A {{study of}} the longest spaceflight {{concluded}} that {{the first three weeks}} are a critical period where attention is adversely affected because of the demand to adjust to the extreme change of environment. Skylab three crews remained one, two, and three months respectively, long term crews on Salyut6, Salyut7, and the ISS last about five to six months and Mir expeditions often lasted longer. The ISS working environment includes further stress caused by living and working in cramped conditions with people from very different cultures who speak a different <b>language.</b> <b>First-generation</b> space stations had crews who spoke a single language; second and third-generation stations have crew from many cultures who speak many languages. The ISS is unique because visitors are not classed automatically into 'host' or 'guest' categories as with previous stations and spacecraft, and may not suffer from feelings of isolation in the same way. Crew members with a military pilot background and those with an academic science background or teachers and politicians may have problems understanding each other's jargon and worldview.|$|R
