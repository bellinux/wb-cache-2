5|$|On 3 April 2009, the Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> for Human Rights {{announced}} that mass graves containing {{the remains of}} approximately 4,500 members of the division had been discovered near Zaprešić. Locals indicated that the Partisan 21st Serbian Division {{was responsible for the}} massacre.|$|E
5|$|After the war, Yugoslavia's new {{communist}} government announced that Sajmište had held {{a total of}} 100,000 prisoners during the war, half of whom were killed. The Yugoslav State War Crimes Commission later estimated {{that as many as}} 40,000 may {{have been killed in the}} camp, including 7,000 Jews. According to the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> for Human Rights in Serbia, the overall death toll was greatly exaggerated by the communists for political purposes, and the real number of inmates was about 50,000, with 20,000 killed. It is estimated that half of all Serbian Jews were killed at Sajmište. The Staro Sajmište memorial estimates that 23,000 people perished in the camp, of whom 10,000 were Jews.|$|E
5|$|The {{number of}} {{civilian}} casualties in Operation Storm is disputed. The State Attorney's Office of the Republic of Croatia claims that 214 civilians were killed156 in 24 instances of war crimes and another 47 as victims of murderduring the battle and in its immediate aftermath. The Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> disputes the claim and reports that 677 civilians were killed during the same period. When submitted as evidence, their report {{was rejected by the}} ICTY due to unsourced statements and double entries contained within. Serbian sources quote 1,192 civilians dead or missing. ICTY prosecutors set the number of civilian deaths at 324. Croatian government officials estimate that 42 Croatian civilians were killed during the operation.|$|E
50|$|The {{original}} {{members were}} the independent <b>Helsinki</b> <b>committees</b> of Austria, Belgium, Canada, France, Netherlands, Norway, Sweden and the United States; an international secretariat {{was established in}} Vienna. The secretariat supported and provided liaison member <b>Helsinki</b> <b>committees</b> and associated human rights groups, and represented them at the international political level. At the time IHF was dissolved, it had forty-four member committees.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committees</b> {{began as}} <b>Helsinki</b> Watch groups. The {{first one was}} founded in the Soviet Union in 1976, the second in 1977 in Czechoslovakia, the third in 1979 in Poland, etc.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committees</b> for Human Rights {{exist in}} many European {{countries}} (the OSCE region) as volunteer, non-profit organizations devoted {{to human rights}} and presumably named after the Helsinki Accords.

50|$|The IHF {{also had}} direct links with {{individuals}} and groups supporting human rights in countries where no <b>Helsinki</b> <b>committees</b> exist. In addition to gathering and analyzing information on human rights conditions in OSCE countries, the IHF acted as a clearing house for this information, disseminating it to governments, inter-governmental organizations, {{the press and the}} public at large.|$|R
5000|$|It {{was founded}} in 1982, {{inspired}} in part by an appeal from Dr. Andrei Sakharov {{for the creation of}} a [...] "unified international committee to defend all Helsinki Watch Group members", and also to co-ordinate their work. The IHF {{was founded in}} response, both to provide an organization which the various independent <b>Helsinki</b> <b>committees</b> could use to support each another, as well as provide an international body to strengthen their work.|$|R

50|$|In 1982, {{after an}} appeal by Dr. Andrei Sakharov, in his 1978 book Alarm and Hope, for “a unified {{international}} committee to defend all Helsinki Watch Group members”, {{a number of}} <b>Helsinki</b> <b>committees</b> held an International Citizens Helsinki Watch Conference in Lake Como, Italy. Ironically, as these groups were meeting and creating a new organization, the Moscow Helsinki Group was forced to disband and almost all its members were arrested. The year before the conference, the U.S. Helsinki Watch Committee—later Human Rights Watch—traveled throughout Eastern and Western Europe seeking out groups and individuals interested in forming an International Helsinki Federation.|$|R

25|$|Lezgins are {{the largest}} ethnic {{minority}} in Azerbaijan. The UNHCR states that Lezgins make up 40% of the populations of the Qusar and Khachmaz regions and that Greater Baku is 1.8% Lezgin. Official Azerbaijani government statistics state that the Lezgin population is only 2% {{of the total population}} of the country, bringing the number to 178,000, however, this figure could be up to double. Arif Yunus suggests that the figure is closer to 250,000-260,000, while some Lezgin nationalists claim that they number more than 700,000. Qusar town is approximately 90 to 95% Lezgin according to the local NGO <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> office.|$|E
25|$|In January 2004, {{prosecutors}} in the trial against Stanislav Galić, a Bosnian Serb general, Sarajevo-Romanija Corps commander in the siege of Sarajevo, introduced into evidence a report including the testimony of ammunition expert Berko Zečević. Working with two colleagues, Zečević's investigation revealed {{a total of six}} possible locations from which the shell in the first Markale massacre could have been fired, of which five were under VRS and one under ARBiH control. The ARBiH site in question was visible to UNPROFOR observers at the time, who reported that no shell was fired from that position. Zečević further reported that certain components of the projectile could only have been fired from one of two places, both of which were {{under the control of the}} Army of Republika Srpska. The court would eventually find Galić guilty beyond reasonable doubt of all five shellings prosecutors had charged him with, including Markale. Although widely reported by the international media, the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> for Human Rights noted that the verdict was ignored in Serbia itself.|$|E
25|$|Another {{consequence}} of Operation Flash was {{the displacement of}} the Serb population from the areaestimated at 13,000 to 14,000 prior to 1 May 1995. Two-thirds of that population fled the region during or immediately after the Croatian offensive. Furthermore, 2,000 were evacuated to Serb-held areas of Bosnia and Herzegovina on their own request within a month of Operation Flash. It was estimated that no more than 1,500 Serbs remained living in the area {{by the end of}} June. Serbian sources claim that 283 Serbs were killed and that between 15,000 and 30,000 were made refugees, while asserting that the population of the region was 15,000 prior to the offensive. Other Serbian and Russian sources claim the population size as high as 29,000. The Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> reported a total of 83 civilians killed, including 30 who were killed near Novi Varoš where Serb civilians and the RSK military were intermingled as they fled south towards the Republika Srpska. A portion of the 30 killed in the retreating column were casualties of HV attacks, while others were killed by RSK troops to speed up the retreat.|$|E

500|$|Bosnian {{courts have}} not filed any war crimes indictments for the massacre. In 2008, Branko Todorović, the President of the <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> for Human Rights in Bijeljina, criticized the [...] "lethargic" [...] and [...] "unacceptable behavior" [...] of the Republika Srpska judiciary. However, since 2003, the {{prosecution}} of war crimes has mostly been {{under the jurisdiction of}} the Court of Bosnia and Herzegovina. In 2000, the International Crisis Group named three individuals from Bijeljina as [...] "potentially indictable for war crimes": ...|$|E
500|$|The ICTY indicted Croatian {{officers}} Janko Bobetko, Rahim Ademi and Mirko Norac, {{for crimes}} committed during Operation Medak Pocket, but that case was also transferred to Croatian courts. Norac {{was found guilty}} and jailed for 7 years; Ademi was acquitted. Bobetko was declared unfit to stand trial due to poor health. The ICTY's indictment against General Ante Gotovina cited at least 150 Serb civilians killed {{in the aftermath of}} Operation Storm. The Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee</b> registered 677 Serb civilians killed in the operation. Louise Arbour, a prosecutor of the ICTY, stated that the legality and legitimacy of the Operation itself was not the issue, but that the ICTY was required to investigate whether crimes were committed during the campaign. The Trial Chamber reiterated that the legality of Operation Storm is [...] "irrelevant" [...] for the case at hand, since the ICTY's remit is processing war crimes. In 2011, Gotovina was sentenced to 24 and Markač to 18 years in prison. In 2012, their convictions were overturned and both were immediately released. Čermak was acquitted of all charges.|$|E

2500|$|Artuković died {{of natural}} causes in prison {{hospital}} in Zagreb on 16 January 1988. His son, Radoslav, requested information about his father's burial from the Yugoslav authorities. A special law was passed in Yugoslavia that the remains of those convicted and sentenced to death but who escaped execution, were to be disposed of as those of executed persons. It is unclear what happened to his remains. In 2010—at the request of one of Artuković's sons, [...] Radoslav, a California native—the president of the Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee,</b> Ivan Zvonimir Čičak, called for authorities to investigate what happened to the remains.|$|E
2500|$|Forty-two HV {{soldiers}} and Croatian policemen {{were killed in}} the attack and 162 wounded. RSK casualties are disputedCroatian authorities cited the deaths of 188 Serb {{soldiers and}} civilians with an estimated 1,0001,200 wounded. Serbian sources, on the other hand, claimed that 283 Serb civilians were killed, contrary to the 83 reported by the Croatian <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committee.</b> It is estimated that out of 14,000 Serbs living in the region, two-thirds fled immediately with more following in subsequent weeks. By the end of June, it is estimated that only 1,500 Serbs remained. Subsequently, the personal representative of the Secretary-General of the United Nations Yasushi Akashi criticised Croatia for [...] "mass violations" [...] of human rights, but his statements were refuted by the Human Rights Watch and to some extent by the United Nations Commission on Human Rights rapporteur Tadeusz Mazowiecki.|$|E

40|$|Background. The {{issue of}} medical {{research}} among mentally ill individuals is complicated. On the one hand, {{there is a}} need for research to improve treatment for mental disorders. On the other hand, there is constant concern about the ability of mentally ill individuals to astutely participate in such research. The aims of this study were to examine the positions of the chairpersons of <b>Helsinki</b> <b>Committees</b> (ethics committees – “ECs”) in Israel regarding placebo-controlled trials among hospitalized mentally ill individuals. Methods. We sent a questionnaire to the chairpersons of ECs in all hospitals that have psychiatric departments in Israel. The questionnaire included questions regarding placebocontrolled pharmaceutical studies of schizophrenia patients. Results. Fourteen completed questionnaires were returned (64 % response rate). Seventyone percent of responders stated that placebo-controlled drug trials are appropriate with schizophrenia patients. Thirty-six percent noted that their EC had approved at least one placebo-controlled schizophrenia drug trial in the previous three years. Seventy percent of responders stated that, in theory, they would approve placebo-controlled schizophrenia drug trials. Thirty percent of responders stated that they would not approve them...|$|R
50|$|In 1979, the US <b>Helsinki</b> Watch <b>Committee</b> was established, {{funded by}} the Ford Foundation.
