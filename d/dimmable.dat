25|$|Some CFLs {{may not be}} {{compatible}} with existing dimming circuits such as those using TRIACs, although more <b>dimmable</b> CFLs are expected to become available as the phase-outs continue. Mains voltage halogen bulbs provide a more efficient <b>dimmable</b> alternative to common incandescent bulbs and are readily available.|$|E
25|$|<b>Dimmable</b> LED lamps are {{available}} from several vendors, although not all LED lamps are compatible with dimmers and their color temperature may not lower, as it does with incandescents.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two types}} of CFLs: {{integrated}} and non-integrated lamps. Integrated lamps combine the tube and ballast in a single unit. These lamps allow consumers to replace incandescent lamps easily with CFLs. Integrated CFLs work well in many standard incandescent light fixtures, reducing the cost of converting to fluorescent. 3-way lamps and <b>dimmable</b> models with standard bases are available.|$|E
25|$|ETC also {{manufactures}} a high-intensity discharge (HID) Source Four {{body with}} a metal-halide lamp. The fixture has a small box attached to the yoke of the fixture which contains the ballast and other additional control gear required to strike and operate an HID lamp. HID lamps are not <b>dimmable.</b> The HID fixture uses less energy than the standard HPL lamp.|$|E
25|$|Objections to {{replacement}} of incandescent lamps for general lighting mainly include the higher purchasing cost of alternative light bulbs. To mitigate {{the effects of}} these concerns, various programs have been put in place ranging from subsidies for lamps to improved standards for measurement of performance and for labelling products. Manufacturers develop fluorescent lamps with reduced mercury content compared to original designs, and recycling programs are intended to prevent mercury release. New lamp types offer improved starting characteristics, and <b>dimmable</b> types are available.|$|E
500|$|Stern lit scenes filmed at the Park Plaza Hotel using <b>dimmable</b> HMI and {{tungsten}} lights rigged within balloon lights. This setup {{allowed him}} to [...] "dial in" [...] the color he wanted, as the blend of tones from the tungsten fixtures, wooden walls and natural daylight {{made it difficult to}} illuminate the scenes using HMIs or daylight exclusively. Stern said the period setting had little effect overall on his lighting choices because the look was mostly applied in the production design and during digital intermediate (DI), the post-production digital manipulation of color and lighting. Technicolor Digital Intermediates carried out the DI. Stern supervised most of the work via e-mailed reference images as he was in Russia shooting another film at the time. He was present at the laboratory for the application of the finishing touches.|$|E
2500|$|Only some CFLs {{are labeled}} for dimming control. Using a dimmer with a {{standard}} CFL is ineffective and can shorten bulb life and void the warranty. <b>Dimmable</b> CFLs are available. The dimmer switch {{used in conjunction with}} a <b>dimmable</b> CFL must be matched to its power consumption range; many dimmers installed for use with incandescent bulbs do not function acceptably below 40W, whereas CFL applications commonly draw power in the range 7–20W. <b>Dimmable</b> CFLs have been marketed before suitable dimmers are available. The dimming range of CFLs is usually between 20% and 90%, but many modern CFLs have a <b>dimmable</b> range of 2% to 100%, more akin to that of incandescent lights. There are two types of <b>dimmable</b> CFL on the market: Standard <b>dimmable</b> CFLs, and [...] "switch-dimmable" [...] CFLs. The latter use a standard light switch, and the on-board electronics chooses the light output level {{based on the number of}} times the switch is turned on and off quickly. <b>Dimmable</b> CFLs are not a 100% replacement for incandescent fixtures that are dimmed for [...] "mood scenes" [...] such as wall sconces in a dining area. Below the 20% limit, the lamp may remain at 20% or flicker or the starter circuitry may stop and restart. Above 80%, the bulb may operate at 100%. However, recent products have solved these problems so that they perform more like incandescent lamps. <b>Dimmable</b> CFLs are more expensive than standard CFLs due to the additional circuitry.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Dimmable</b> white LED bulbs are available. Some {{of these}} offer a warmer dimmed light by {{including}} diodes {{that are of}} a lower colour temperature than the main diodes.

2500|$|A <b>dimmable</b> ballast is {{very similar}} to a rapid start ballast, but usually has a {{capacitor}} incorporated to give a power factor nearer to unity than a standard rapid start ballast. [...] A quadrac type light dimmer can be used with a dimming ballast, which maintains the heating current while allowing lamp current to be controlled. [...] A resistor of about 10kΩ is required to be connected in parallel with the fluorescent tube to allow reliable firing of the quadrac at low light levels.|$|E
2500|$|Nissan {{sought to}} elevate {{the status of the}} DR30 Skyline as their new {{flagship}} model in light of this success, and it received a generous amount of changes to distinguish it from lesser Skyline models in August 1983. Interior equipment was significantly upgraded to now include electric windows, air conditioning and power steering as standard in the new RS-X model (for Extra) with an increased curb weight of around [...] it also included a driver's seat with multi-way power lumbar adjustment, anti-skid control, fog lamps, rear deck spoiler and other features such as <b>dimmable</b> instrument cluster lighting; gone were the days of the spartan, stripped-out race interior, although this could still be specified at time of purchase. But by far the most striking change to the RS was the new unique front end treatment, nicknamed Tekkamen (...) or Iron Mask by fans for its distinctive look. The headlights were considerably slimmer, and instead of a conventional grille the bonnet now sloped down to two narrow slits above a facelifted front bumper and airdam.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the removal}} of the scene {{construction}} shop in 2014 to the new Production Building (see above), a thirteen-month transformation began of the building into the Hay-Patton Rehearsal Center by demolishing everything except the masonry exterior and the steel framework and raising the second floor three feet. Following a plan developed by Ogden Roemer Wilkerson Architecture carried out by Adroit Construction at a cost of $4.4 million, it hosted its first rehearsal on 29 December 2015. The building is equipped with a sophisticated sound system and has six rehearsal halls, three of them some 3000 square feet sufficient to fully stage a play for all three of the Festival’s theatres and one which matches the size of the Thomas Theatre stage. All six include fully sprung floors to protect actors’ joints when dancing, engaging in stage combat, or similar physical activities. The LED lighting system is zoned and <b>dimmable,</b> the ceilings have steel tracks which allow for suspension of scenery, lights, loudspeakers and even people. [...] Some have special features such as small conversation areas and dance-style mirrors. Other features include a stage management office, a recording studio, a movement studio focused on the Feldenkrais Method, a voice studio for work on vocal technique, stamina, and dialect; a loading dock, a conference room, showers, two studios designed warmup spaces that double as small meeting rooms, two green rooms (the theatrical term for a break room), in these cases equipped with refrigerator, sink, dishwasher, and tables (custom-made by the prop shop) and chairs.|$|E

50|$|Some X10 {{controllers}} with triac solid-state outputs may {{not work}} well or at all with low power devices (below 50 watts) or devices like fluorescent bulbs that do not present resistive loads, due to the small leakage current of the device and any protective filtering around the triac. Use of an appliance module, which has a relay with metallic contacts, rather than a lamp module, may resolve this problem.Not all devices {{can be used on}} a dimmer. Fluorescent lamps are not <b>dimmable</b> with incandescent lamp dimmers; certain models of compact fluorescent lamps are <b>dimmable</b> but cost more. Motorized appliances such as fans, etc. generally will not operate as expected on a dimmer.|$|E
