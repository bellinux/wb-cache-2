5000|$|In earlier {{communications}} methods, an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> ("EOM") sequence <b>of</b> <b>characters</b> {{indicated to}} a receiving device or operator {{that the current}} message has ended. In teleprinter systems, the sequence [...] "NNNN", on a line by itself, is an <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> indicator. In several Morse code conventions, including amateur radio, the prosign AR (dit dah dit dah dit) means <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The message {{ends with}} three bursts of the AFSK [...] "EOM", or <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Message,</b> {{which is the}} text NNNN, preceded each time by the binary 10101011 calibration.|$|R
5000|$|Technical {{requirements}} for sending <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> containing non-ASCII <b>characters</b> by email include ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You are marvellously {{like your}} brother," [...] Anna said, beaming upon him. [...] "I have a letter for you, and no <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages.</b> Where can {{we sit down}} and talk?" ...|$|R
5000|$|The control codes felt {{essential}} for data transmission were the start <b>of</b> <b>message</b> (SOM), <b>end</b> <b>of</b> address (EOA), <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> (EOM), <b>end</b> <b>of</b> transmission (EOT), [...] "who are you?" [...] (WRU), [...] "are you?" [...] (RU), a reserved device control (DC0), synchronous idle (SYNC), and acknowledge (ACK). These were positioned {{to maximize the}} Hamming distance between their bit patterns.|$|R
6000|$|... "That's one of 'em {{complaining}} now. Listen: 'Disheartening--most disheartening.' It's quite pathetic. Have {{you ever}} seen a spiritualistic seance? It reminds me of that sometimes--odds and <b>ends</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> coming out <b>of</b> nowhere--a word here and there--no good at all." ...|$|R
50|$|Segment {{terminator}} {{indicates the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> segment.|$|R
50|$|An RWT is not {{required}} during a calendar week in which an RMT is scheduled. No testing {{has to be done}} during a calendar week in which all parts of the EAS (header burst, attention signal, audio <b>message,</b> and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> burst) have been legitimately activated.|$|R
50|$|EAN {{messages}} are treated similarly to other EAS messages. When a message is received, the receiver {{is to open}} an audio channel to the originating source until the <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Message</b> (EOM) tones are received. After the EOM is received, the station is then allowed to resume normal programming.|$|R
30|$|Condition 4 : Add a {{space to}} the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> is {{asserted}} {{when the}} characters [...] "NNNN" [...] are received.|$|R
50|$|The same {{procedure}} will be continued with different key letters through the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b>|$|R
50|$|Mail sent through NHS.net {{may have}} a 15-line tag essay {{appended}} to the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b>|$|R
50|$|A DS-Link {{implements}} {{transfer of}} data on the wires using a token protocol. A token can either carry one byte of data or a control message, such as flow control, <b>end</b> <b>of</b> packet, <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message.</b> A single bit distinguishes the token type and an additional parity is used for error detection. A byte is therefore encoded in 10 bits and a control token is encoded in 4 bits.|$|R
50|$|The same {{procedure}} will be {{continued through the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> using the four numbers to designate the alphabet shifts.|$|R
5000|$|... as {{the user}} vainly {{tries to find}} the right exit sequence, with the {{incorrect}} tries piling up at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b>|$|R
5000|$|... "L3" [...] in text speech means [...] "Live, Love, Laugh." [...] People use {{it usually}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> their <b>message</b> as part <b>of</b> their signature.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>Ending</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> is {{indicated}} by NNNN which is the End-of-Message Signal that also has a character pattern that is not found in standard text.|$|R
50|$|According to the FCC, 18% of {{stations}} failed to either receive or retransmit the alert. The message, according to some, also lacked the alert code {{which would allow}} the President to speak. Due to a feedback loop in the PEP system, the test could be heard {{several times in the}} background, and the EOM (<b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message)</b> code was sent twice, violating EAS rules. The test was cut down to 30 seconds rather than the proposed three minutes.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message</b> is {{indicated}} by hitting ctrl+d (and/or, dependent on the configuration settings, by writing a line consisting of a single '.'), causing the message to be passed asynchronously to the Mail transport agent. In order to send messages synchronously the [...] internal, POSIX-standardized variable sendwait has to be set, usually in the system-wide initialization file (usually /etc/mail.rc); dependent on the used [...] variant the (nonstandard) command-line option [...] can also be used, e.g., [...]|$|R
5000|$|Hey Joe, Paris is in France, not England. --Mary [...] --- {{original}} message --- You {{just had}} a call from England, from Paris I think. --Joe --- <b>end</b> <b>of</b> original <b>message</b> --- ...|$|R
50|$|The SAME EOM (<b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>message)</b> {{tone was}} {{heard in the}} movie trailer for Knowing and in the series Jericho where its {{familiar}} emergency use and its increasing cadence {{create a sense of}} foreboding. It was used in the movie trailer for Olympus Has Fallen and The Purge. These uses have since been heavily discouraged on-air by the FCC (outside of public service announcements demonstrating SAME and EAS technology), and stations and networks using them (for instance, TBS and WNKY-TV in Bowling Green, Kentucky) in advertising or promotions have been fined for doing so.|$|R
50|$|If {{severe weather}} is detected, alerts (mainly a severe {{thunderstorm}} or tornado warning) are {{issued by the}} National Weather Service (effectively replacing a significant weather advisory), and the Emergency Alert System may activate and broadcast the alert. EAS alerts begin with a SAME header, which sounds as three digital bursts and automatically activates the EAS, a 1050 Hz attention signal, the alert as processed by text-to-speech software, then the SAME <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Message</b> tone to <b>end</b> the alert broadcast. Also, sirens may be activated to warn the public who are not listening to media to take cover.|$|R
5000|$|At the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> {{the caller}} can either leave a voice mail, {{transfer}} {{directly to the}} agent, request an automatic fax of specs for the home, enter another extension to listen about another home, or simply hang up.|$|R
5000|$|Unlike other messages, the EAN was not {{the alert}} itself, but rather a notice that the {{activation}} is beginning. [...] After the <b>End</b> <b>of</b> <b>Message</b> (EOM) tones were sent, normal programming did not resume. Instead, most stations were to broadcast emergency information in a specific priority order. Messages from the President are always broadcast first. Next comes local messages, statewide and regional messages, and finally national messages not originating from the President. When an EAN was initially received, and during any time a new message was not available, an FCC mandated standby script was used (and repeated). [...] Other stations, which held special permission from the FCC, would sign off until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the EAN.|$|R
25|$|SSL 2.0 {{uses the}} TCP {{connection}} close {{to indicate the}} <b>end</b> <b>of</b> data. This means that truncation attacks are possible: the attacker simply forges a TCP FIN, leaving the recipient unaware <b>of</b> an illegitimate <b>end</b> <b>of</b> data <b>message</b> (SSL 3.0 fixes this problem by having an explicit closure alert).|$|R
50|$|A similar {{solution}} can {{be applied}} at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> inverting the CRC register before it is appended to the message. Again, any non-zero change will do; inverting all the bits (XORing with an all-ones pattern) is simply the most common.|$|R
50|$|Voice drop is same as Power IVR, {{except it}} will not wait for the touch tone key {{responses}} or speech command at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> after playing the message, call is dropped, mostly this is used for payment reminders and similar.|$|R
5000|$|The Guide Channel {{consists}} of the first 2 non-Framing control Slots in each Superframe. This [...] "guide byte" [...] is normally 0, but if a control message straddles a Superframe boundary, it indicates the number of bytes until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> that <b>message.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The Murray code also {{introduced}} {{what became known}} as [...] "format effectors" [...] or [...] "control characters" [...] the CR (Carriage Return) and LF (Line Feed) codes. A few of Baudot's codes moved to the positions where they have stayed ever since: the NULL or BLANK and the DEL code. NULL/BLANK was used as an idle code for when no messages were being sent, but the same code was used to encode the space separation between words. Sequences of DEL codes (fully punched columns) were used at start or <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>messages</b> or between them, allowing easy separation <b>of</b> distinct <b>messages</b> (BELL codes could be inserted in those sequences to signal to the remote operator that a new message was coming or that transmission <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> was terminated).|$|R
50|$|The {{most useful}} special device was the {{so-called}} automaton, a rapid deciphering machine developed {{for use on}} the American Diplomatic Strip Cypher Another machine developed, a type of comparator (Spezialvergleicher), to solve Japanese transposition ciphers by dragging the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> through the cipher text.|$|R
50|$|An OP NOTE may be {{inserted}} after the SIGNATURE, before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message,</b> relating to reply and/or servicing matters. The words “OP NOTE” {{are used to}} introduce this information when transmitting the message. OP NOTES are optional, and are generally not considered part <b>of</b> the <b>message</b> to be delivered to the addressee. They are primarily {{for use by the}} handling operators.|$|R
5000|$|In {{telecommunication}} networks, {{the transmission}} time, {{is the amount}} of time from the beginning until the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> transmission. In the case <b>of</b> a digital <b>message,</b> it is the time from the first bit until the last bit <b>of</b> a <b>message</b> has left the transmitting node. The packet transmission time in seconds can be obtained from the packet size in bit and the bit rate in bit/s as: ...|$|R
5000|$|Piggybacking flag: If {{this bit}} {{is set to}} 1 then another GTP-C message with its own header shall be present at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the current <b>message.</b> There are {{restrictions}} as to what type <b>of</b> <b>message</b> can be piggybacked depending on what the toplevel GTP-C message is.|$|R
50|$|A second {{transposition}} {{is needed}} to obscure the letters. Following the chess analogy, the route taken might be the knight’s move. Or some other path can be agreed upon, such as a reverse spiral, together with a specific number of nulls to pad the start and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> a <b>message.</b>|$|R
50|$|Each {{message is}} encoded into a {{sequence}} of bytes. These bytes are transferred using a binary chunked encoding, where each chunk is preceded by an unsigned, big-endian 16-bit integer denoting the number of bytes that immediately follow. A length of 0 is used to denote the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> the <b>message.</b>|$|R
