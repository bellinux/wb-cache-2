500|$|John's Gospel {{presents}} {{the teachings of}} Jesus not merely as his own preaching, but as divine revelation. John the Baptist, for example, states in : [...] "He whom God has sent speaks the words of God, for he gives the Spirit without measure." [...] In [...] Jesus says, [...] "My teaching is not mine but his who sent me." [...] He asserts {{the same thing in}} : [...] "Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in me? The words that <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you</b> I do not speak on my own; but the Father who dwells in me does his works." ...|$|E

[...] " [...] (Truly, truly <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> {{whatever}} you ask of the Father in My name, so {{will it be}} given to you.), {{is given to the}} bass as the vox Christi, the voice of Jesus. The instruments, strings probably doubled by oboe d'amore, introduce vocal motifs which the voice picks up. The bass sings the text three times, while the instruments continue playing the same motifs. Julian Mincham observes: [...] "The richness of the text, the unobtrusive nature of the melodic ideas and the gently flowing rhythms combine to create an appropriate atmosphere of dignified restraint".|$|E
500|$|I think that's bullshit. The word {{police can}} fuck off. I don't {{want to be}} policed! I'm not {{interested}} in political correctness. The word [...] "bitch" [...] means {{a lot of different}} things. Everything is about context. When I first moved to England and heard the word [...] "cunt", I was horrified. People were calling each other cunts! And then I realized that, in that culture, it was different—they slapped each other on the back and said, [...] "Who's the cunt, right, you're my best mate!" [...] The word [...] "fuck" [...] doesn't just mean sexual intercourse. I mean, [...] "You're a stupid fuck," [...] "Are you going to fuck with me?" [...] "Fuck off!"... Sex {{has nothing to do with}} any of those expressions, and the same goes for [...] "bitch". If <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> [...] "I'm a badass bitch," [...] I'm owning myself, I'm saying, [...] "I'm strong, I'm tough, and don't mess with me."

2500|$|In the gospels, Jesus {{affirmed the}} commandment against {{adultery}} {{and seemed to}} extend it, saying, “But <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> anyone who looks on a woman to lust after her has committed adultery with her already in his heart.” However, some commentators, including St. Thomas Aquinas, say that Jesus was making the connection with the commandment, “You shall not covet your neighbor’s wife.” [...] He taught his audience that the outward act of adultery does not happen apart from sins of the heart: [...] "From within people, from their hearts, come evil thoughts, unchastity, theft, murder, adultery, greed, malice, deceit, licentiousness, envy, blasphemy, arrogance, folly. All these evils come from within and they defile.” ...|$|E

2500|$|Both Millerite {{leaders and}} {{followers}} were left generally bewildered and disillusioned. Responses varied: some {{continued to look}} daily for Christ's return, while others predicted different dates—among them April, July, and October 1845. Some theorized that the world had entered the seventh millennium—the [...] "Great Sabbath", and that therefore, the saved should not work. Others acted as children, basing their belief on Jesus' words in : [...] "Truly, <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> whoever does not receive the kingdom of God like a child shall not enter it." [...] Millerite O. J. D. Pickands used [...] to teach that Christ was now sitting on a white cloud and must be prayed down.

But <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>to</b> <b>you,</b> that whosoever shall look on a woman to lust after her, hath already committed adultery with her in his heart.Jesus also makes reference to the passages from Genesis in his teachings on marriage in Matthew:Have ye not read, that he who made man from the beginning, Made them male and female? And he said: For this cause shall a man leave father and mother, and shall cleave to his wife, and they two shall be in one flesh. Therefore now they are not two, but one flesh. What therefore God hath joined together, let no man put asunder. They [...] say to him: Why then did Moses command to give a bill of divorce, and to put away?
