5|$|<b>Exploration</b> of salt domes {{across the}} plains of the Texas Gulf Coast took off with major oil fields opening at Sour Lake in 1902, Batson in 1903, Humble in 1905, and Goose Creek (modern Baytown) in 1908.

5|$|In {{the early}} 15th century, the {{countries}} of the Iberian peninsula began to sponsor <b>exploration</b> beyond the boundaries of Europe. Prince Henry the Navigator of Portugal (d. 1460) sent expeditions that discovered the Canary Islands, the Azores, and Cape Verde during his lifetime. After his death, <b>exploration</b> continued; Bartolomeu Dias (d. 1500) went around the Cape of Good Hope in 1486 and Vasco da Gama (d. 1524) sailed around Africa to India in 1498. The combined Spanish monarchies of Castile and Aragon sponsored the voyage of <b>exploration</b> by Christopher Columbus (d. 1506) in 1492 that discovered the Americas.

5|$|Initially, oil {{production}} {{was conducted by}} many small producers. The early <b>exploration</b> and production frenzy produced an unstable supply of oil, which often resulted in overproduction. In the early years, a few major finds led to easy availability and major drops in prices, but were followed by limited <b>exploration</b> and a sudden spike in prices as production dwindled. The situation led <b>exploration</b> to spread into the neighboring states of Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas, who competed with Texas for dominance in {{oil production}}. The strike at Glenn Pool near Tulsa, Oklahoma in 1905 established Tulsa as the leading U.S. oil production center until the 1930s. Though Texas soon lagged behind Oklahoma and California, {{it was still a}} major producer.|$|E
5|$|It is {{estimated}} that 5.5 million tonnes of uranium exists in ore reserves that are economically viable at US$59 per lb of uranium, while 35 million tonnes are classed as mineral resources (reasonable prospects for eventual economic extraction). Prices went from about $10/lb in May 2003 to $138/lb in July 2007. This has caused a big increase in spending on <b>exploration,</b> with US$200 million being spent worldwide in 2005, a 54% increase on the previous year. This trend continued through 2006, when expenditure on <b>exploration</b> rocketed to over $774 million, an increase of over 250% compared to 2004. The OECD Nuclear Energy Agency said <b>exploration</b> figures for 2007 would likely match those for 2006.|$|E
