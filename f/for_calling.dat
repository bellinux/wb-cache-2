40|$|Abstract—Call {{admission}} control (CAC) plays {{a significant role}} in providing the desired quality of service in wireless networks. Many CAC schemes have been proposed. Analytical results for some performance metrics such as call blocking probabilities are obtained under some specific assumptions. It is observed, however, that due to the mobility, some assumptions may not be valid, which is the case when the average values of channel holding times <b>for</b> new <b>calls</b> and handoff calls are not equal. In this paper, we reex-amine some of the analytical results <b>for</b> <b>call</b> blocking probabilities <b>for</b> some <b>call</b> {{admission control}} schemes under more general as-sumptions and provide some easier-to-compute approximate for-mulas. Index Terms—Blocking probability, call admission control (CAC), mobile computing, resource allocation, wireless networks. NOMENCLATURE Number of channels in a cell. Threshold <b>for</b> new <b>call</b> bounding scheme. Threshold for the cutoff priority scheme.

5|$|Between Acton Town and Hammersmith, District line trains serve all stations, but Piccadilly line trains run {{non-stop}} to Hammersmith except <b>for</b> <b>calling</b> at Turnham Green at {{the start}} {{and end of the}} day. The run between Acton Town and Hammersmith spans nearly three miles – the longest distance between stops on the Piccadilly line. West of Acton Town, District line trains go via Ealing Common to Ealing Broadway and Piccadilly line trains run either via South Ealing to Heathrow, or via Ealing Common to Uxbridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{main reason}} <b>for</b> <b>calling</b> {{is to allow}} male frogs to attract a mate. Males may call {{individually}} or {{there may be a}} chorus of sound where numerous males have converged on breeding sites. Females of many frog species, such as the common tree frog (Polypedates leucomystax), reply to the male calls, which acts to reinforce reproductive activity in a breeding colony. Female frogs prefer males that produce sounds of greater intensity and lower frequency, attributes that stand out in a crowd. The rationale for this is thought to be that by demonstrating his prowess, the male shows his fitness to produce superior offspring.|$|E
5|$|Back in the present, Chandler apologizes to Monica. Rachel reveals that's not {{the story}} she was {{referring}} to. The flashbacks continue to 1988; Ross and Chandler arrive for dinner {{to find that}} Monica has slimmed down, and Chandler now finds her attractive. Monica tells Rachel {{that she wants to}} humiliate Chandler <b>for</b> <b>calling</b> her fat, so Rachel suggests tricking him into taking off his clothes. Monica tries to seduce Chandler by rubbing various objects, including a knife, against her skin. She drops the knife and severs his toe. He is rushed to hospital to have it reattached but, in the commotion, Monica mixes up the digit with a carrot. In the present, Chandler becomes upset after learning that he had lost his toe because he called Monica fat, and angrily leaves. When Monica comes by his apartment seeking his forgiveness by putting a turkey on her head, he inadvertently tells her he loves {{her for the first time}} in their relationship. A tag scene shows another of Phoebe's past life memories as she serves in a World War I field hospital and again lost an arm.|$|E

30|$|It {{can thus}} be assumed that after the {{introduction}} of priorities, the amount of resources available <b>for</b> <b>calls</b> of classes with higher priorities increases and, this way, the amount of resources <b>for</b> <b>calls</b> with lower priorities decreases.

50|$|By {{the end of}} the 1990s, {{very few}} {{companies}} still had need of the Other Place Point codes, and other rating arrangements were made.

5|$|Randy Orton began a {{feud with}} Ric Flair, after Flair {{was the one}} {{responsible}} for making Orton lose the match against Batista.

Flair retaliated to Orton's comments, stating that individuals like Shawn Michaels and Mick Foley, who Orton had previously feuded with, were not legends, therefore Orton was not a Legend Killer. Flair also stated that he and Orton would have a match at Taboo Tuesday and the fans would {{have the opportunity to}} choose what type of match they face in. At Taboo Tuesday, Orton and Flair met in a Steel Cage match, which was the fans selection. Orton won the match after delivering an RKO to Flair. After the match, Flair shook Orton's hand.|$|E
