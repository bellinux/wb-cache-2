5|$|Meanwhile, sugar {{shortages}} during World War <b>I</b> <b>hurt</b> {{sales of}} Archibald Query's Marshmallow Creme, so Query sold his recipe in 1920 to two men from Swampscott, Massachusetts, H. Allen Durkee and Fred L. Mower, who began distributing the product through their company, Durkee-Mower Inc. The pair renamed the product Toot Sweet Marshmallow Fluff, and Durkee-Mower continues {{to sell the}} product under the name Marshmallow Fluff. The sandwich made with peanut butter and marshmallow fluff continued to be eaten, but was not called a Fluffernutter until 1960, when an advertising firm Durkee-Mower hired created the term as a more effective way to market the sandwich. Fluffernutter is a registered trademark of Durkee-Mower, although the company's U.S. trademark registrations for the term cover only ice cream and printed recipes. In 2006, Durkee-Mower sued Williams-Sonoma Inc. in the United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts, alleging that Williams-Sonoma infringed on its trademark by selling a marshmallow and peanut butter chocolate-covered candy under the Fluffernutter name.|$|E

The new owner was Thomas Lamont, a senior partner in the Wall Street firm of J.P. Morgan & Co.. Unable to stem the paper's financial losses, he sold it to a consortium of 34 financial and reform political leaders, headed by Edwin Francis Gay, dean of the Harvard Business School, whose members included Franklin Delano Roosevelt. Conservative Cyrus H. K. Curtis—publisher of the Ladies Home Journal—purchased New-York Evening Post in 1924 and briefly {{turned it into a}} non-sensational tabloid in 1933.|$|E
25|$|If {{you read}} my book, {{you find a}} certain ambivalence there. Journalistically, I {{thought it was an}} {{important}} story because it explained why the CIA would send Joe Wilson – a former Clinton White House aide with no track record in intelligence and no experience in Niger – on a fact-finding mission to Africa. From a personal point of view, I said in the book I probably should have ignored what I'd been told about Mrs. Wilson. Now I'm much less ambivalent. I'd go full speed ahead because of the hateful and beastly way in which my left-wing critics in the press and Congress tried to make a political affair out of it and tried to ruin me. My response now is this: The hell with you. They didn't ruin me. I have my faith, my family, and a good life. A lot of people love me – or like me. So they failed. I would do the same thing over again because I don't think <b>I</b> <b>hurt</b> Valerie Plame whatsoever.|$|E

Charleston Daily Mail contributor Kevin McDonough wrote that in the season premiere episode [...] "FYI: <b>I</b> <b>Hurt,</b> Too" [...] of season seven, singer Jennifer Lopez appeared [...] "in a farfetched and laugh-free guest appearance.

[...] In her annual countdown of the best quotes of 2004, Amy Amatangelo of Knight Ridder included Will Arnett's line [...] "Like a Sicilian woman's eyebrows, we could not be kept apart".

500|$|... "Blank Page" [...] is {{a simplistic}} piano {{arranged}} ballad, which lasts for a duration of [...] (four minutes and four seconds). Her vocal range spans from F3 to G5. Lyrically, {{the song is}} about how Aguilera wishes to [...] "wipe the slate clean" [...] with a former lover and [...] "reconcile an old romance". She knows that she has wronged him, but is asking {{to be given a}} second chance. Andrew Hampp for Billboard noted that this sentiment is revealed by Aguilera in the lyrics [...] "If I could do undo that <b>I</b> <b>hurt</b> you/ I would do anything for us to make it through". The song begins with the chords of a piano as Aguilera sings [...] "I know there's hurt/ I know there's pain/ But people change/ Lord, knows I've been no saint/ In my own way/ Regret choices I've made/ How I do I say I'm sorry?/ How do I say I'm sorry?." [...] On the chorus, the lyrics are hopeful that she can right any wrongs she may have committed: [...] "Draw me a smile, and save me tonight/ I'll be your blank page waiting for you to bring me to life/ Paint me a heart, let me be your art/ I am a blank page waiting for life to start/ Let our hearts start and beat as one together/ Let our hearts start and beat as one forever". The arrangement of the minimalist piano composition is [...] "fiery" [...] yet [...] "spare".

2500|$|Following the {{production}} of Rabies, a [...] "glacial coldness" [...] grew between the group members, with Key and Goettel often siding against Ogre, feeling he {{was more interested in}} solo work. The group had expressed their ultimate disappointment in Rabies, with Goettel stating that the completed product was [...] "less within the Skinny Puppy vision", and Key being displeased with Jourgensen's involvement. Ogre also expressed his disapproval for the album stating that he had [...] "flopped"; Ogre continued on that [...] "the work and artistic environment really weren't there at all either. It was completely negative". Key and Goettel used this time to complete work on some of their side projects such a Hilt, releasing their first effort Call the Ambulance (Before <b>I</b> <b>Hurt</b> Myself) which was produced by Rave. Key also reunited with Bill Leeb to form the project known as Cyberaktif; Goettel acted as an assistant producer and provided some instrumentation.|$|E
2500|$|In 2000, O'Donnell {{partnered with}} the {{publishers}} of McCall's {{to revamp the}} magazine as Rosie's McCall's (or, more commonly, Rosie). The magazine was launched as a competitor to fellow talk show hostess Oprah Winfrey's monthly magazine O. Rosie covered issues including breast cancer, foster care and other matters of concern to O'Donnell. In the September 2000 issue, she shared that [...] "she has struggled with depression her entire life" [...] and decided to start medications when she realized her fears were affecting her family. With a strong start and a circulation close to 3.5 million, things looked promising but the magazine stumbled as conflicts emerged between O'Donnell and the editors. The contract gave O'Donnell control over editorial process and editorial staff but veto power remained with publisher Gruner+Jahr USA. O'Donnell quit the magazine in September 2002, following a dispute over editorial control. [...] "If I'm {{going to have my}} name and my brand on the corner of a magazine, it has to be my vision" [...] she told People. Rosie magazine folded in 2003. In late 2003, O'Donnell and the publishers each sued the other for breach of contract. The publishers claimed that, by removing herself from the magazine's publication, she was in breach of contract. The trial received considerable press coverage. O'Donnell would often give brief press interviews outside of the courtroom responding to various allegations. Of note was a former magazine colleague and breast cancer survivor who testified that O'Donnell said to her on the phone that people who lie [...] "get sick and they get cancer. If they keep lying, they get it again". O'Donnell apologized the next day and stated [...] "I'm sorry <b>I</b> <b>hurt</b> her the way I did, that was not my intention." [...] The judge dismissed the case, ruling that neither side should receive damages.|$|E
