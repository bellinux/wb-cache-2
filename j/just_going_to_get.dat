2500|$|Late in April 2008, Smith {{suffered}} a thigh injury which {{prevented him from}} playing for seven weeks. In late June 2008, Smith {{signed a contract with}} Leicestershire– who were in the second division of the County Championship– to play on loan from Lancashire for a month. Lancashire had a full strength bowling attack– including Andrew Flintoff and James Anderson who had returned from England duty– and Smith was unable to break into the side. Smith explained that [...] "I am Lancashire born and bred and I want to play for Lancashire for all of my career. I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> some cricket and make sure I am ticking over well". He was immediately drafted into the Leicestershire side.|$|E

5000|$|Badgley {{was cast}} after {{he sent a}} tape of him singing. The {{audition}} tape that he sent included {{an interpretation of the}} Led Zeppelin III album, which also appears in the film. For the role, Badgley lost some weight: [...] "I remember in my head thinking, 'I'm never <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as thin as him, so I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop working out. I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> stop <b>getting</b> in the sun. I'm <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> try <b>to</b> <b>get</b> as thin and pale as possible'." [...] He also took guitar and vocal lessons. The vocal coach taught him how to warm up and warm down his voice and the guitar teacher taught him scales and progressions. Serving as a consultant, songwriter and former collaborator of Jeff Buckley, Gary Lucas played and rehearsed with Badgley. Badgley performed all his singing scenes live.|$|R

5000|$|One of {{the largest}} issues {{expected}} to face Governor Bush was the unpopular image of his brother, President George W.

5000|$|In 1976, Armistead became {{director}} of the Organized Crime Strike Force in New Orleans, Louisiana. In an interview, he characterized the Dixie mafia as more ruthless than Cosa Nostra: [...] "There wasn't a well from Mississippi to West Texas that didn't have a dead body floating in it. The big difference {{was the lack of}} ceremony. It was <b>just</b> 'I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> rid of Ambrose today; I don't need permission; and I go out and do it.' As simple as that.

[...] And his sole prop in this world of strangers departed, leaving him to find his way for himself.|$|E
30|$|Many {{participants}} {{discussed how}} {{their participation in}} CrossFit prompted changes in how they regarded the relationship between food and fitness. Most frequently, participants remarked that their participation in CrossFit had underscored for them the notion that what they ate impacted their athletic performance. Accordingly, participants discussed the notion of “eating to perform,” which frequently entailed the need to increase their food consumption to “to fuel for a workout” (Rachel, 28  years): “[I’ve experienced a] shift from thinking about calories to thinking about…[food as]…fuel, if I don’t eat enough I’m <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> never <b>get</b> better, because my muscles are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be super tired all the time” (Emma, 26  years).|$|R

2500|$|On January 2, 2007, two {{employees}} of Cheli's in Detroit were fatally stabbed. Megan Soroka, 49, was {{a manager at}} the restaurant and Mark Barnard, 52, was a chef. Police arrested Justin Blackshere, 17, who confessed to the crime. He was a busboy at the restaurant and was fired in November 2006. Blackshere's pregnant girlfriend had also been fired from {{her job as a}} dishwasher. Blackshere was found guilty of {{murder in the first degree}} on August 22, 2007. He was sentenced to life in prison without parole on September 7, 2007. Chelios took a leave of absence from the Detroit Red Wings to help the families of his murdered employees.

60|$|They {{lay down}} among {{a clump of}} bushes a short {{distance}} from the lake, {{and as soon as the}} sun had set went back to the boat again. They had already made another meal, and had finished their maize and water. They stood by the boat waiting until it should become perfectly dark, and looking across the tranquil sheet of water at the distant town, over which the smoke still hung heavily, and as the sky darkened flashes of fire could be seen. They were at last <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on board when they heard an exclamation of surprise behind them. Looking round they saw two natives, who had evidently come down with the intention of going out in their boat.|$|E

[...] "I don't believe she'll ever forget you; I reckon she won't if I have any say in it. Me and Joey talks about you every night when we're gettin' her to sleep." [...] She gurgled out a half-sob, half-laugh, as the little one pulled and pushed at his face, which he twisted this way and that, to get {{her hand in his}} mouth. [...] "She always cared more for you than she did for me.

60|$|He {{meant to}} rest awhile, {{and then get}} up and {{spend the night in}} {{receiving}} impressions. He could not think of any one who had done the facts of the eve of sailing on an Atlantic liner. He thought he would use the material first {{in a letter to the}} paper and afterwards in a poem; but he found himself unable to grasp the notion of its essential relation to the choice between chicken croquettes and sweetbreads as entrees of the restaurant dinner where he had been offered neither; he knew that he had begun to dream, and that he must get up. He was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> up, when he woke to a sense of freshness in the air, penetrating from the new day outside. He looked at his watch and found it was quarter past six; he glanced round the state-room and saw that he had passed the night alone in it. Then he splashed himself hastily at the basin next his berth, and jumped into his clothes, and went on deck, anxious to lose no feature or emotion of the ship's departure.|$|E

5000|$|On casting white {{actors to}} {{maximize}} profits, David White, National Executive Director of the actors' union SAG-AFTRA said popular black actors such as Will Smith, Denzel Washington, and David Oyelowo refuted the casting rationale. Assistant professor of telecommunications Andrew J. Weaver said, [...] "There is an assumption in Hollywood that whites would avoid movies with majority black casts, or any race cast for that matter. You see this whitewashing of films - even films that have minority characters written into them are being cast with whites." [...] Film professor Mitchell W. Block said studios adhered to casting norms {{as a matter}} of practicing business to appeal to investors and producers. Director Ridley Scott said without the casting of big-name actors, his 2014 biblical epic film Exodus: Gods and Kings would never have been made, saying, [...] "I can't mount a film of this budget... and say that my lead actor is Mohammad so-and-so from such-and-such... I'm <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> financed." [...] USA Today noted with films like Breakfast at Tiffany's (1961), A Mighty Heart (2007), and Pan (2015), [...] "White actors continue to be top of mind for plum roles, despite the under-representation of people of color at the acting, directing and producing levels." ...|$|R
60|$|In short, {{they who}} have not {{attended}} particularly to this subject are but little aware to what an extent quadrupeds and birds are employed, especially in the fall, in collecting, and so disseminating and planting the seeds of trees. It is the almost constant employment of the squirrels at that season and you rarely meet with one that has not a nut in its mouth, or is not <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> one. One squirrel-hunter of this town {{told me that he}} knew of a walnut-tree which bore particularly good nuts, but that on going to gather them one fall, he found that he had been anticipated by a family of a dozen red squirrels. He took out of the tree, which was hollow, one bushel and three pecks by measurement, without the husks, and they supplied him and his family for the winter. It would be easy to multiply instances of this kind. How commonly in the fall you see the cheek-pouches of the striped squirrel distended by a quantity of nuts! This species gets its scientific name Tamias, or the steward, from its habit of storing up nuts and other seeds. Look under a nut-tree a month after the nuts have fallen, and see what proportion of sound nuts to the abortive ones and shells you will find ordinarily. They have been already eaten, or dispersed far and wide. The ground looks like a platform before a grocery, where the gossips of the village sit to crack nuts and less savory jokes. You have come, you would say, after the feast was over, and are presented with the shells only.|$|E
60|$|The {{three weeks}} which the {{appointment}} lasted drew to an end. Philip had attended sixty-two cases, {{and he was}} tired out. When he came home about ten o'clock on his last night he hoped with all his heart {{that he would not}} be called out again. He had not had a whole night's rest for ten days. The case which he had just come from was horrible. He had been fetched by a huge, burly man, the worse for liquor, and taken to a room in an evil-smelling court, which was filthier than any he had seen: it was a tiny attic; most of the space was taken up by a wooden bed, with a canopy of dirty red hangings, and the ceiling was so low that Philip could touch it with the tips of his fingers; with the solitary candle that afforded what light there was he went over it, frizzling up the bugs that crawled upon it. The woman was a blowsy creature of middle age, who had had a long succession of still-born children. It was a story that Philip was not unaccustomed to: the husband had been a soldier in India; the legislation forced upon that country by the prudery of the English public had given a free run to the most distressing of all diseases; the innocent suffered. Yawning, Philip undressed and took a bath, then shook his clothes over the water and watched the animals that fell out wriggling. He was <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> into bed when there was a knock at the door, and the hospital porter brought him a card.|$|E

The regular Night Watchman at the Deadhouse is ill in bed, and they're obliged to find somebody to take his place till he gets well again. I'm the Somebody. They tried two other men--but the Deadhouse gave them the horrors. My respectable sister spoke for me, you know.

5000|$|Terry recounted {{once that}} he rode Bodacious for a {{qualified}} ride twice {{and that he}} was bucked off twice in his career. One of the times he got bucked off Bodacious he was sent to the hospital. The 5' 8", 140 lb. West, who is the first and last rider <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a qualified ride, has gotten aboard Bodacious four times. He has scored a ride twice and been bucked off twice. In 1991, when West scored the first ever qualified ride on Bodacious, who was not well known yet, the prize money bore that out, only $181. They met again in 1993, and Bodacious got his revenge, bucking him off and bruising his ribs. Their third meeting was a disaster for West, and Bodacious almost ended him. It was in 1994 at an event in Houston, TX. During the ride, he was not wearing a protective vest. Bodacious exploded off his front feet and more damage was done than a head bashing. Terry received broken ribs, a broken wrist, and a punctured lung. [...] "He didn't want <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on him that night," [...] said West's wife, Michelle, a former barrel rider. [...] "He was saying 'I'm <b>just</b> not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> on him.' And I said 'Big deal. What's the worst thing that can happen <b>to</b> you? You'll <b>get</b> bucked off?' [...] "Then when he was lying out there, gasping for air, about to pass on, I said to myself 'That's real smart, Michelle. I decided never to put my two cents in from then on.'" [...] However, West did not let his injuries stop him taking on Bodacious again. In 1995, and wearing a protective vest this time, he rode him through to a qualified ride to score 87 points. He earned a much larger amount of $10,000. The score between them was 2-2.|$|R

5000|$|In 2007, Dylan {{appeared}} on several tribute albums, including Endless Highway: The Music of The Band and Instant Karma: The Amnesty International Campaign to Save Darfur, a charity album consisting of covers of John Lennon songs. On Endless Highway, Dylan performed {{a cover of}} The Band's [...] "Whispering Pines." [...] For Instant Karma, Dylan performed a cover of Lennon's [...] "Gimme Some Truth," [...] with Dhani Harrison contributing backing vocals on the song.In September 2007, it was reported by The New York Times that Dylan was recording his first solo album at producer, Rick Rubin's home in the Hollywood Hills. [...] Regarding its sparse instrumentation and production, Dylan described {{the differences in the}} writing process for Seeing Things, compared to writing for the Wallflowers: [...] A lot of times when you write songs, you’re aware that this line is <b>just</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> help you <b>get</b> <b>to</b> the next line and someone's probably <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do an organ fill right there anyway - you can let those go. But with something like this, it was just three instruments, really; vocals being one of the instruments, which then makes the lyrics being one of the instruments. You’re more aware that things are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be more exposed and you can’t really let anything go unless you’re confident that this is what you want to say. Following the completion of recording in 2007, Seeing Things was released on June 10, 2008. [...] The album received generally favorable reviews and peaked at No.24 in the U.S. on the Billboard 200. [...] Following the release of Seeing Things, Dylan made several television appearances to promote the album and toured with a backing band called The Gold Mountain Rebels, which consisted of Wallflowers drummer Fred Eltringham, guitarist Audley Freed and bassist George Reif. In the summer and fall of 2008, Dylan and the Gold Mountain Rebels played a combination of theaters and festivals in the U.S., Europe, and Japan, including Farm Aid in Mansfield, Massachusetts and the Newport Folk Festival. In addition to touring with the Gold Mountain Rebels, Dylan and Eltringham also performed several shows with the Wallflowers in 2008.|$|R
