40|$|Current <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{level of}} the total {{fertility}} rate (TFR) between Dutch municipalities are smaller than they were <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1970 s and 1980 s. Nevertheless, there are still considerable differences. Small municipalities have higher TFRs than large cities. This article aims {{to answer the question}} whether these differences will decline further until differences between large and small cities disappear. For that purpose we develop a regression model of regional <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TFR including demographic, socioeconomic, and cultural variables. Using the estimation results we decompose <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> fertility between large and small cities into <b>the</b> contribution of <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> levels of <b>the</b> determinants versus <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> relationships between the determinants and fertility. The results show that <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> cultural variables have a larger effect on <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TFR than the demographic and socioeconomic variables. As cultural differences do not tend to change quickly, they will not lead to quick changes <b>in</b> regional <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TFR. Demographic <b>differences</b> are not expected to lead to strong changes either, as the two demographic variables (household structure and ethnic structure) have opposite effects. As the effect of the socioeconomic variable is caused by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magnitude of the regression coefficient rather than by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> value of this variable, even if <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> this variable disappeared, this would still not lead to convergence of the TFR. Thus the article concludes that <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> TFR between large and small cities are not likely to diminish quickly. ...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} I present a {{methodology}} that uses matching comparisons to explain gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> wages. <b>The</b> approach emphasizes gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supports of the distributions of observable characteristics and provides useful insights about {{the distribution of}} <b>the</b> unexplained gender <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> pay. <b>The</b> proposed methodology, a non-parametric alternative to the Blinder-Oaxaca (BO) wage gap decomposition, {{does not require the}} estimation of earnings equations. It breaks down the gap into four additive elements, two of which are analogous to the elements of the BO decomposition (but computed only over the common support of the distributions of characteristics), while the other two account for <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supports. Using data for Peru <b>in</b> <b>the</b> period 1986 - 2000, I found that this problem of non-comparability accounts for 23 % and 30 % of the male and female working populations respectively. The matching methodology allows us to quantify the effect of explicitly recognizing these <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supports. <b>In</b> this way, <b>the</b> 45 % gender wage gap in Peru is decomposed as: 11 % explained by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> supports, 6 % explained by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> distributions of individual characteristics and the remaining 28 % cannot be explained by <b>differences</b> <b>in</b> observable individuals? characteristics.
