It is also a major consumer of synthetic gypsum, a byproduct of flue-gas desulfurization.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{asbestos}} became increasingly widespread {{towards the end of}} the 19th century, when its diverse applications included fire retardant coatings, concrete, bricks, pipes and fireplace cement, heat, fire, and acid resistant gaskets, pipe insulation, ceiling insulation, fireproof drywall, flooring, roofing, lawn furniture, and drywall <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> In 2011 it was reported that over 50% of UK houses still contained asbestos, despite a ban on asbestos products some years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> and some plasters. Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E

50|$|Knockdown Texture is a drywall {{finishing}} style. It is a mottled texture, {{more intense}} than a simple flat finish, but less intense than orange peel, or popcorn, texture.Knockdown texture is created by watering down <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> to a soupy consistency. A trowel is then used to apply the <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> The <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> will begin to form stalactites as it dries. The trowel is then run {{over the surface of}} the drywall, knocking off the stalactites and leaving the mottled finish.|$|E
50|$|Ready-mixed <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is most {{commonly}} used in hanging drywall for new or remodeled homes. Application is simple and easy, usually never taking more than three or four coats. When used for new walls, <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> effectively eliminates all blemishes {{from the surface of}} the drywall, such as fasteners, damage, or drywall tape. <b>Joint</b> <b>compound</b> is used to finish gypsum panel joints, corner bead, trim and fasteners, as well as skim coating. In addition, it is also very handy for fixing minor blemishes or damages to walls. It easily patches up holes, bumps, tears, and other minor damage.|$|E

40|$|An ongoing {{research}} effort {{designed to}} reconstruct the character of historical exposures associated with use of chrysotile-containing <b>joint</b> <b>compounds</b> naturally raised questions concerning how the character (e. g. particle size distributions) of dusts generated from use of recreated materials com-pares to dusts from similar materials manufactured historically. This also provided an opportu-nity to further explore the relative degree that the characteristics of dusts generated from a bulk material are mediated by {{the properties of the}} bulk material versus the mechanical pro-cesses applied to the bulk material by which the dust is generated. In the current study, the char-acteristics of dusts generated from a recreated readymix and recreated drymix were compared to each other, to dusts from a historical dry mix, and to dusts from the commercial chrysotile fiber (JM 7 RF 3) used in the recreated materials. The effect of sanding on the character of dusts gen-erated from these materials was also explored. Dusts from the dry materials studied were gener-ated and captured for analysis in a dust generator-elutriator. The recreated and historical <b>joint</b> <b>compounds</b> were also prepared, applied to drywall, and sanded inside sealed bags so that the par-ticles produced from sanding could be introduced into the elutriator and captured for analysis.

There are also asbestos and Mold health issues in removing old drywall, as well as lead paint on drywall first painted several decades ago. For all of these reasons, constant use of a respirator is widely recommended, and even required by some labor authorities. Potential falls from elevated work platforms or ladders are another risk.|$|R
50|$|Ready-mix {{lightweight}} <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is a pre-made form of <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> {{designed for}} fast application and easy maintenance. The compound {{is a complex}} combination often including water, limestone, expanded perlite, ethylene-vinyl acetate polymer, attapulgite, and other ingredients. The delicate mixture of compounds gives it a creamy texture that spreads easily onto drywall surfaces and then hardens as the moisture evaporates. Drying type compound {{takes a long time}} to dry out and is used to fill holes or gaps and shrinks as it drys, possibly producing cracks in thick applications. Ready-mix <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is usually more forgiving than the setting type of <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> It can be used for as long a period of time as needed, and does not dry up unless left unattended for a long period of time, but must be kept from freezing. This type of compounds should be used at temperatures above 55 F and all of the materials should be a similar temperature.|$|E

This decision was designed to save weight, reducing the draft of the ship and lowering the fuel consumption, but it also posed the possibility of corrosion problems that can occur with joining the dissimilar metals together, so a <b>jointing</b> <b>compound</b> was coated between the steel and aluminium surfaces to prevent this happening. The low melting point of aluminium caused concern when QE2 was serving as a troop ship during the Falklands War: some feared that if the ship were struck by a missile, as was , her upper decks would collapse quickly due to fire, thereby causing greater casualties.|$|R

50|$|Drywall {{finishers}} use {{the mesh}} frequently. In fact, {{it is common}} to replace the paper tape used to float the joint between two pieces of drywall. The mesh that drywall finishers use comes on a roll just like paper drywall tape. The added benefit for the drywall finisher is to roll out the mesh over a great distance before having to apply the first coat of <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> Not only does it help them in this manner, but it also causes a stronger bond between the <b>joint</b> <b>compound,</b> the tape and the wall.|$|E
5000|$|Often {{referred}} to as drywall taping mud, <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> is the primary material used in the drywall industry by a tradesperson, or applicator, called a [...] "drywall mechanic," [...] "taper," [...] or [...] "drywall taper." [...] A similar compound is used in various ways as a sprayed-on textural finishing for gypsum panel walls and ceilings that have been pre-sealed and coated with <b>joint</b> <b>compound.</b> The flexibility and plastic qualities of <b>joint</b> <b>compound</b> make it a very versatile material both as sealer or finishing coat for wall surfaces, and also in decorative applications that range from machine sprayed texturing to hand-trowelled or even hand-crafted and sculptural finishes.

40|$|With the {{increasing}} concern over asbestos, more companies are considering {{the possibility of}} changing to asbestos-free, non-metallic gaskets. However, caution should be exercised when adopting alternative materials because their applicational requirements are sig@-cantly different. Specifically, when compared with premium quality compressed asbestos jibre grades, the calendered asbestos-free grades generally have: lower temperature and pressure ratings, temperature and pressure ratings which do not co-exist (that is as the temperature increases, the maximum internal pressure sealable decreases), higher minimum surface stress requirements, lower maximum surface stress values, lower creep resistance, diflerent chemical resistance, poorer performance in steam and less tolerance to the deleterious effects of <b>jointing</b> <b>compounds.</b> This paper attempts to demonstrate why this new group of materials {{should not be considered}} as a direct replacement for compressed asbestos fibre but rather as a limited substitute. It also offers some hope for the future with the prediction of the development of a calendered asbestos-free grade with similar properties to the best traditional asbestos-based grades but without the large cost penalty involved in selecting exfoliated graphite. ...|$|R
