40|$|South Korea has {{the most}} {{supported}} agricultural sector among member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). Public intervention mainly consists of high production prices supported by government purchases, together with high tariffs that protect domestic producers from foreign competition and implicitly tax consumers. Trade liberalization recently took place in particular sectors, and Korea is now a major importer of oilseeds and coarse grains. However, Korea only reluctantly exposed its agricultural sector to {{the provisions of the}} Uruguay Round Agreement on Agriculture (URAA) of the World Trade Organization (WTO). It has kept nearly prohibitive tariffs in the rice, meat, and dairy sectors; high production subsidies in most other sectors; and significant non-tariff trade barriers on many commodities, including administrative barriers (<b>import</b> <b>monopolies)</b> and sanitary restrictions...|$|R
50|$|Neste was {{established}} in 1948 as the state petrol company of Finland, to ensure the availability of refined fuels. This entailed the building of refineries and developing the necessary technology. The refineries were built using American technology, which the U.S. government was first reluctant to provide, because many American oil companies would be competitors. After lobbying by the contractor Lummus, they relented, mainly due {{to the threat of}} the contract being handed to the Soviet Union. In practice, much of the oil refined was of Soviet origin, although {{after the collapse of the}} Soviet Union, North Sea oil was used. Thanks to Neste, the oil crisis of 1973 had little effect in Finland. It held a legal <b>import</b> <b>monopoly</b> until the market liberalisation in the 1990s. The oil transport infrastructure in Finland was built and is owned by Neste, and thus petrol stations usually obtain fuels from Neste, although the monopoly is no longer government-sanctioned. In the 1970s, Neste introduced petrochemical and plastics production and natural gas to Finland. In 1994, Gasum {{was established}} with Gazprom as the minor (25%) shareholder. In 1994, polyolefin production was separated into Borealis, a joint venture with the Norwegian Statoil. In 1998, Neste's 50% stake in Borealis was sold to OMV and IPIC.|$|E

In the early 1990 s, Jamaica {{carried out a}} number of important structural reforms that had a favorable effect on the public finances, resulting in overall public sector surpluses averaging 3 percent of GDP in FY 1993 – 95. These steps included the elimination of general price subsidies and the decontrol of prices, the elimination of the <b>import</b> <b>monopoly</b> of the Jamaica Commodity Trading Corporation, and the institution of cost pass-through mechanisms for public enterprises. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the performance of}} the National Food Authority (NFA) with respect to its function of price stability and implications for public finances, and recommends policy reforms where warranted. It finds that NFA has been unsuccessful in stabilizing producer prices, but relatively successful in stabilizing retail prices, largely through exercise of its <b>import</b> <b>monopoly.</b> However, it does so at high cost, partly due to operational inefficiency, but largely owing to its fundamental policy mandate. The study recommends relinquishing this mandate, and leaving a greater role for the private sector in stabilizing rice prices, with NFA function and price policy limited to maintaining strategic reserves a variable import levy...|$|E

50|$|GSFMO {{implemented}} the official procurement program, purchasing locally produced wheat and barley at guaranteed prices for domestic sales and exports. The procurement price was steadily reduced during the 1980s because of massive overproduction and for budgetary reasons, {{but it was}} substantially higher than international prices. By the late 1980s, the procurement price for wheat, for example, was three times the international price. Although quantity restrictions were implemented to limit procurement, pressures from a growing farm lobby led to ceiling-price waivers. Moreover, the government encountered considerable fraud with imports being passed off as domestic production. To control this situation, the government has granted <b>import</b> <b>monopolies</b> for some agricultural products to the GSFMO, while procurement and import subsidies on certain crops have been shifted to encourage a more diversified production program. Finally, agricultural and water authorities provided massive subsidies {{in the form of}} low-cost desalinated water, and electric companies were required to supply power at reduced charges.|$|R
5000|$|The {{term was}} {{subsequently}} borrowed by François-Xavier Verschave {{as the title}} of his 1999 criticism of French policies in Africa: La Françafrique, le plus long scandale de la République (...) [...] Verschave and the association Survie, of which he was president until his death in 2005, re-used the expression of Houphouët-Boigny to name and denounce the many concealed bonds between France and Africa. He later defined Françafrique as [...] "the secret criminality in the upper echelons of French politics and economy, where a kind of underground Republic is hidden from view". He said that it also means [...] "France à fric" [...] (fric is a slang word for [...] "cash"), and that [...] "Over the course of four decades, hundreds of thousands of euros misappropriated from debt, aid, oil, and cocoa or drained through French <b>importing</b> <b>monopolies,</b> have financed French political-business networks (all of them offshoots of the main neo-Gaullist network), shareholders' dividends, the secret services' major operations and mercenary expeditions." ...|$|R
40|$|If {{one takes}} the {{pair-wise}} definition of equivalence, that a quota will {{give rise to}} an implicit tariff rate which, if alternatively set as a tariff, will generate {{the same level of}} imports as the quota, it is unambiguously clear that equivalence breaks down when there is monopoly import under both tariff and quota. An explicit tariff will not lead to an import level which, if set alternatively as a quota, will generate an implicit tariff equal to the explicit tariff; nor will a quota lead to an implicit tariff which, if set alternatively as an explicit tariff, will generate the same level of imports. In the case when foreign supply is monopolistic, the implicit tariff rate is zero under the quota but setting the actual tariff rate at zero and removing the quota restriction will not yield the same level of imports and domestic production; the truly equivalent tariff rate is higher. Similarly, in the case where there is domestic, <b>import</b> <b>monopoly</b> instead, the truly equivalent tariff is lower than the implicit tariff rate in the quota alternative...|$|E
5000|$|Upon {{laying out}} the street in 1810, Governor Macquarie also carved out land from the Domain for the {{building}} of Sydney Hospital, with its frontage on Macquarie Street. Due to the reluctance of the British government to provide funding, the building contract for the hospital provided {{for the government to}} provide convict labour, and for part of the project costs to be paid in the form of rum <b>import</b> <b>monopolies,</b> leading to the name the [...] "Rum Hospital". The hospital buildings were completed in 1816. Although called [...] "elegant and commodious" [...] by some commentators, architect Francis Greenway criticised both the design and construction. As the only major hospital in the colony at the time, the hospital took up almost the entire eastern frontage of the southern half of Macquarie Street. However, the hospital's capacity exceeded the needs of Sydney at the time, and almost from the start space in its two wing buildings began to be occupied by various government institutions. The northern wing building was occupied by the Legislative Council and Executive Council, and was eventually expanded to become the Parliament House for New South Wales. The southern wing building became the Sydney Mint, among other functions.|$|R

40|$|Government {{interventions}} in foodgrain markets have existed in India {{in one form}} or another for about four decades, starting during the Second World War. Because supplies from Burma were cut off during the war, price controls and movement restrictions were introduced by the government; subsequently, other measures were added with a view to providing a minimum supply at subsidized prices. The major components of the government's food management policy over time have included procurement from domestic producers, <b>monopoly</b> <b>imports,</b> trade regulations, price controls, food distribution through fair-price shops, and buffer-stock operations (Chopra, 1981; Gupta, 1977; H.

50|$|Salomon {{was born}} in 1815 in Les Cayes. His family was {{influential}} in the tiny black elite of the south. Prominent and educated, his family often clashed with the relatively more powerful mulatto elite of south Haiti. During the regime of Charles Rivière-Hérard, the Salomons were wanted for arrest after a heated battle with the mulattoes and exiled to Neyba. As Faustin Soulouque came into power, Salomon returned along with other powerful black leaders to serve the new government. Salomon became the minister of finance under Faustin and began to monopolize export transactions in coffee and cotton, run foreign <b>imports</b> through state <b>monopolies,</b> and impose levies on capital. As a result, smuggling and piracy exploded during Soulouque's reign. After the fall of Soulouque, Salomon was exiled to Paris and London, where he read and traveled widely.|$|R

40|$|Many {{countries}} are establishing hydropower projects, often times {{without the consent}} of the communities directly affected by the dams. Water supply downstream is altered, communities are displaced and livelihoods can be uprooted due to a dam. My project objectives included studying Costa Rica?s hydropower industry, environmental flow methods, governance and decisions involving dams, and socioeconomic implications of hydroelectric projects on indigenous populations. As a case study, I investigated the Boruca Dam, proposed to be built in southern Costa Rica, which would displace local indigenous groups. Over two months, I interviewed twenty individuals from all social sectors and I attended two international water conferences. My results include an analysis of the use of hydropower produced by Costa Rica?s national electrical utility, plans to increase dependency on hydroelectric projects for the future, and reduce dependency on <b>imported</b> oil, and <b>monopoly</b> of information and resources. Hydropower currently produces 82 % of the country?s energy. These hydroelectric projects produce large environmental and social costs for society. Interviews with members of indigenous communities make clear the younger generation supports development while the elder generation fears development is replacing their cultural identity. Overall, the reforms needed for water use include transparency in the decision making process and the application of water use decisions, equality in the participation elements of decisions, create a vision of development, training for environmental flow science, implementation of a new water law, and enforcement to protect water and its shareholders...|$|R
40|$|The thesis fills {{a gap in}} the {{literature}} about Import-substituting Industrialisation (ISI) by analysing non-tariff trade controls – mainly import licenses. The principal focus is on Mexico, a case that has not been analysed in detail. The core questions addressed include: which specific pattern licensing followed; what was the economic rationale behind such pattern; is there evidence that non-tariff controls were ‘captured’ that is, facilitating rent-seeking? In order to answer these questions, the project takes a qualitative and quantitative approach, using primary evidence gathered in archives as well as statistics from secondary sources, which are combined in novel ways. Chapter I reviews {{the literature}} on rent-seeking and on Mexican trade and industrial policies. Chapter II provides an overview of the macroeconomic context of ISI in Mexico. Chapter III presents the qualitative evidence, exploring the allocation of import licenses in nine industries, and shows how politically connected firms either obtained licenses (which gave them an advantage via cheaper inputs) or manage to block competing <b>imports</b> (thus earning <b>monopoly</b> rents). Chapter IV provides descriptive statistics of the licensing system, and demonstrates that the policy lacked internal consistency - the overwhelming majority of products were protected for far longer than officially specified, and that illegal source of rents from trade –smuggling and “free perimeters”- were significant. The main findings, which shed light on larger debates about ISI are that excessive protectionism was neither effective nor sustainable and that cronyism characterised the post-Second World War process of industrialisation in Mexico...|$|R
40|$|News on Pakistan’s trade {{performance}} is rarely found side by side, or even associated with, headlines on gender equality. Yet both are burning issues for Pakistani society. This article aims at highlighting their connections. Put differently, {{it shows how}} the world market is tied to Pakistani stoves. Trade is important for Pakistan’s economy due to the country’s comparative openness. The country—like {{most parts of the}} subcontinent—is a late globalizer, as compared to, for example, East Asia or Latin America. Structural adjustment programs implemented since 1988 {{under the aegis of the}} World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have been one catalyst for trade liberalization. Trade tariffs were reduced significantly, resulting in rising trade to gross domestic product (GDP) ratios. Today, the value of exports from Pakistan surpasses 21 billion U. S. dollars. Besides textile manufactures such as cotton cloth, bed wear, and knitwear, key exports include rice as well as leather manufactures, indicating the special role of the agricultural and manufacturing sectors for Pakistan’s trade. The main export destinations include the northern markets of the United States and European countries—such as the United Kingdom and Germany—as well as the Gulf states and Hong Kong (China). Trade is more than an aggregate statistic on flows of goods and services. It means employment in export garment manufacturing for some, and job losses caused by cheaper Chinese imports for others. It may provide some consumers with access to affordable generic medicines that were previously unavailable, supply others with cheaper prices due to intensified competition, and present a third group with less choice as cheap <b>imports</b> gain a <b>monopoly</b> in the market...|$|R
