For training and testing of the ANN model, a number of experiments have been carried out using Taguchi’s orthogonal array in the design of experiments (DOE). The cutting parameters used are nose radius, cutting speed, cutting feed, axial depth of cut and radial depth of cut. The ANN model was developed using multilayer perceptron (MLP) network for nonlinear mapping between the input and the output parameters. The adequacy of the developed model is verified using coefficient of determination (R). It was found that the R 2 value is 1 for surface roughness.

Welding tool steels moulds is also extremely demanding regarding the mechanical/metallurgical know how and the welder’s skills.

Acellular slime <b>mould</b> <b>P.</b> polycephalum is originally famous as a computing biological substrate due to its alleged ability to approximate shortest path from its inoculation site to a source of nutrients. Several algorithms were designed based on properties of the slime mould. Many of the Physarum-inspired algorithms suffer from a low converge speed. To accelerate the search of a solution and reduce a number of iterations we combined an original model of Physarum-inspired path solver with a new a parameter, called energy. We undertook a series of computational experiments on approximating shortest paths in networks with different topologies, and number of nodes varying from 15 to 2000.

Although the thresholds of pathogenicity have not yet been established, the toxic, allergic and infectious risk of indoor moulds is better understood today. A study on indoor fungi contamination for 128 dwellings was done between October and May in France. It concerned 69 dwellings, the occupants of which either complained to the sanitary authorities about problems of moulds and humidity or consulted a doctor who related their symptoms to housing conditions. Fifty-nine other dwellings, the occupants of which were healthy, constituted the control group. We present the statistical analysis of questionnaires, which aimed to clarify characteristics of dwellings associated with high concentrations of airborne moulds. Air samples were taken with an impactor in 500 rooms. On visiting dwellings, investigators obtained answers to 25 questions concerning characteristics of inhabitants and living space, as well as the presence of mould indicators. Indoor and outdoor temperature and indoor relative humidity of air measurements were taken. The total concentration of fungi in the air was significantly higher in ground floor apartments versus those on other floors (p = 0. 047), in small and highly occupied dwellings (p = 0. 03 and 0. 003), in dwellings with electric heating (p = 0. 04), without a ventilation system (p = 0. 003), with water damage (p = 0. 003), and finally, in those where the investigator noted an odour of moisture or visible <b>moulds</b> (<b>p</b> < 0. 001).

40|$|Metal cutting {{has been}} shown by other researchers, as well as within this work, to be a {{stochastic}} process with many complex behaviours and sources of variance which detrimentally affects the scatter in tool life results. Empirical testing is still the preferable method for cutting tool development especially in an industrial environment, as models are currently unable to replicate the complex interaction between cutting tool and workpiece as tool wear {{is the result of}} several mechanisms working simultaneously. The need to quantify differences in sample groups and make sound statistical inferences about their populations is crucial for any tooling manufacturer to manage the level of quality, as well as to continually improve their products. This is highlighted in the cutting tool market as end users are continually demanding longer tool lives, low variance and no early tool life failures, as large amounts of overhead costs are incurred in partially manufactured components, with sudden tool failure resulting in substantial costs to a business. Therefore, the objective of this research was to design and develop a destructive accelerated drill test which is robust, sensitive, rapid and low cost. It was found, that although sources of machining complexity and variance which affects the scatter in tool life data have been identified within the literature, a solution to deal with it has not yet been provided. Using a systems approach facilitated the management of the complex behaviours so a machining regime could be identified which offered a repeatable and mono-modal tool failure, a robust test, as well as, where possible, to minimise and empirically model the effect of machining variance on tool life scatter, a sensitive test. Annealed D 2 cold work tool steel was able to offer a low tool life standard deviation and a mono-modal tool failure mode. In stark contrast <b>P</b> 20 plastic <b>mould</b> steel showed a larger standard deviation and a bi-modal failure mode. This work also showed that for accelerated testing of HSS cutting tools, which are thermally sensitive, an abrasive wear test is preferable over a thermo-chemical wear type. Pre inspection of drill geometries for the rejection of Jobber drills outside of tolerance was found to be insignificant when distinguishing the difference between sample means. It was assumed that the drills outside of tolerance would be randomly distributed, along with their effect on tool life. It was important however to determine, that the drills outside of tolerance, would have a small effect on the standard deviation in tool life, relative to the sample size and relative to the sample means so statistically significant results could be determined. An extended Taylor&rsquo;s tool life model was generated which modelled the effect of plate hardness between the range of 467 HLD to 511 HLD for annealed D 2. This work showed that the life of uncoated M 2 HSS 6. 35 mm Jobber drills is sensitive to small changes in plate hardness. At a cutting speed of 25 m/min an increase in plate hardness from 467 HLD to 492 HLD, an increase of 5. 3 %, decreased drill life by 70. 9 %...|$|R
