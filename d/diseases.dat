Pathogenic bacteria cause <b>diseases</b> such as plague, tuberculosis and anthrax. Protozoa cause <b>diseases</b> including malaria, sleeping sickness, dysentery and toxoplasmosis.

5|$|Damage and {{subsequent}} dysfunction in mitochondria {{is an important}} factor in a range of human <b>diseases</b> due to their influence in cell metabolism. Mitochondrial disorders often present themselves as neurological disorders, including autism.

In the vast majority of cases, these <b>diseases</b> are transmitted by a female to her children, as the zygote derives its mitochondria and hence its mtDNA from the ovum. <b>Diseases</b> such as Kearns-Sayre syndrome, Pearson syndrome, and progressive external ophthalmoplegia are thought to be due to large-scale mtDNA rearrangements, whereas other <b>diseases</b> such as MELAS syndrome, Leber's hereditary optic neuropathy, myoclonic epilepsy with ragged red fibers (MERRF), and others are due to point mutations in mtDNA.|$|E
40|$|Background and objectives: Chronic kidney <b>disease</b> (estimated glomerular {{filtration}} rate < 60 ml/min per 1. 73 m 2) and peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> (ankle-brachial index < 0. 9) independently predict mortality. It {{was hypothesized that}} the risk for death is higher in patients with both chronic kidney <b>disease</b> and peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> compared with those with chronic kidney <b>disease</b> or peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> alone. Design, setting, participants, & measurements: A total of 1079 patients who had an ankle-brachial index and serum creatinine recorded within 90 d {{of each other in}} 1999 were studied retrospectively. Glomerular {{filtration rate}} was estimated using the Modification of Diet in Renal <b>Disease</b> equation. Patients were categorized into four groups: Chronic kidney <b>disease</b> and peripheral arterial <b>disease,</b> chronic kidney <b>disease</b> alone, peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> alone, or no chronic kidney <b>disease</b> or peripheral arterial <b>disease.</b> Results: The overall 6 -yr mortality rate was 28 % (n 284). Patients with both chronic kidney <b>disease</b> and peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> had the highest mortality rate (45 %) compared with patients with chronic kidney <b>disease</b> alone (28 %), peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> alone (26 %), and neither condition (18 %). After adjustment for clinical and demographic variables, the chronic kidney <b>disease</b> and peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> group had an increased odds for death when compared with the no chronic kidney <b>disease</b> or peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> group or the single <b>disease</b> groups. Conclusions: These findings indicate that patients with both chronic kidney <b>disease</b> and peripheral arterial <b>disease</b> have a significantly higher risk for death than patients with either <b>disease</b> alone.

5|$|<b>Diseases</b> {{introduced}} to the Americas by the conquistadors had a great impact upon indigenous populations. As the Spanish were occupied with the conquest of Mexico, these <b>diseases</b> ran ahead of them from 1519 onwards. A smallpox epidemic swept through Guatemala in 1520–1521, and {{is also likely to}} have spread throughout the Pipil region of El Salvador. By the time the Spanish arrived in the area in 1524, it is estimated that up to 50% of the native population of El Salvador had already been eliminated by the new <b>diseases,</b> against which they had no immunity. It is likely that disease had significantly weakened the Pipil by the time they fielded large armies against the Spanish at Acajutla and Tacuzcalco. Further waves of epidemic <b>diseases</b> spread across Mesoamerica in 1545–1548, and again in 1576–1581, reducing indigenous populations to just 10% of their pre-contact levels, making successful resistance against the European colonisers extremely difficult. The deadliest of the newly introduced <b>diseases</b> were smallpox, malaria, measles, typhus, and yellow fever. Their introduction was catastrophic in the Americas; it is estimated that 90% of the indigenous population had been eliminated by disease within the first century of European contact.|$|E
5|$|Disorders of {{the immune}} system can result in {{autoimmune}} <b>diseases,</b> inflammatory <b>diseases</b> and cancer. Immunodeficiency occurs when the immune system is less active than normal, resulting in recurring and life-threatening infections. In humans, immunodeficiency can either be the result of a genetic disease such as severe combined immunodeficiency, acquired conditions such as HIV/AIDS, or the use of immunosuppressive medication. In contrast, autoimmunity results from a hyperactive immune system attacking normal tissues as if they were foreign organisms. Common autoimmune <b>diseases</b> include Hashimoto's thyroiditis, rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes mellitus type 1, and systemic lupus erythematosus. Immunology covers the study of all aspects {{of the immune}} system.|$|E
50|$|Kidney <b>disease,</b> {{also known}} as {{nephropathy}} or renal <b>disease,</b> is damage to or <b>disease</b> of a kidney.
