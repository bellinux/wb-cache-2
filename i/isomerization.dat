5|$|AlCl3 is also {{widely used}} for {{polymerization}} and <b>isomerization</b> reactions of hydrocarbons. Important {{examples include the}} manufacture of ethylbenzene, which used to make styrene and thus polystyrene, and also production of dodecylbenzene, which is used for making detergents.|$|E
5|$|AlCl3 is {{probably}} the most commonly used Lewis acid and {{also one of the most}} powerful. It finds application in the chemical industry as a catalyst for Friedel–Crafts reactions, both acylations and alkylations. Important products are detergents and ethylbenzene. It also finds use in polymerization and <b>isomerization</b> reactions of hydrocarbons.|$|E
5|$|Research {{involving}} {{the reaction was}} relatively quiet in subsequent years, until in the mid-1980s when several syntheses employing the Nazarov cyclization were published. Shown below are key steps in the syntheses of Trichodiene and Nor-Sterepolide, the latter of which is thought to proceed via an unusual alkyne-allene <b>isomerization</b> that generates the divinyl ketone.|$|E

40|$|Much {{information}} {{bearing on}} the mechanism of the Diels-Alder reaction has been obtained from studies of <b>isomerizations</b> of various adducts of cyclopentadiene.

50|$|Many {{catalytic}} cycles operate via complexes that {{alternate between}} 18-electron and square-planar 16-electron configurations. Examples include Monsanto acetic acid synthesis, hydrogenations, hydroformylations, olefin <b>isomerizations,</b> and some alkene polymerizations.|$|R
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans <b>isomerization</b> that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of photochemistry.|$|E
5|$|Acetic acid is {{produced}} industrially both synthetically and by bacterial fermentation. About 75% of acetic acid made {{for use in}} the chemical industry is made by the carbonylation of methanol, explained below. The biological route accounts for only about 10% of world production, but it remains important for the production of vinegar because many food purity laws require vinegar used in foods to be of biological origin. Other processes are methyl formate <b>isomerization,</b> conversion of syngas to acetic acid, and gas phase oxidation of ethylene and ethanol. Acetic acid is often a side product of different reactions, i.e. during heterogeneous catalytic acrylic acid synthesis or fermentative lactic acid production. As of 2003–2005, total worldwide production of virgin acetic acid was estimated at 5Mt/a (million tonnes per year), approximately half of which was produced in the United States. European production was approximately 1Mt/a and declining, while Japanese production was 0.7Mt/a. Another 1.5Mt were recycled each year, bringing the total world market to 6.5Mt/a. Since then the global production has increased to 10.7 Mt/a (in 2010), and further; however, a slowing in this increase in production is predicted. The two biggest producers of virgin acetic acid are Celanese and BP Chemicals. Other major producers include Millennium Chemicals, Sterling Chemicals, Samsung, Eastman, and Svensk Etanolkemi.|$|E

25|$|The dithienylethenes {{are also}} of {{interest}} {{for the fact that}} their <b>isomerization</b> requires very little change of shape.

In the case of some analogs, photochromic behavior can even be carried out in single crystals without disrupting the crystal structure.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} elementary reactions are unimolecular and bimolecular reactions. Only one molecule {{is involved in}} a unimolecular reaction; it is transformed by an <b>isomerization</b> or a dissociation into one or more other molecules. Such reactions require the addition of energy in the form of heat or light. A typical example of a unimolecular reaction is the cis–trans <b>isomerization,</b> in which the cis-form of a compound converts to the trans-form or vice versa.|$|E

25|$|One of {{the most}} {{intriguing}} properties of azobenzene (and derivatives) is the photoisomerization of trans and cis isomers. The two isomers can be switched with particular wavelengths of light: ultraviolet light, which corresponds to the energy gap of the π-π* (S2 state) transition, for trans-to-cis conversion, and blue light, which is equivalent to that of the n-π* (S1 state) transition, for cis-to-trans <b>isomerization.</b> For a variety of reasons, the cis isomer is less stable than the trans (for instance, it has a distorted configuration and is less delocalized than the trans configuration). The trans isomer is more stable by approximately 50 kJ/mol, and the barrier to <b>isomerization</b> in the ground state is approximately 100 kJ/mol.|$|E
50|$|The {{alkyl group}} migrates {{in the order}} of thermodynamical {{stability}} methyl < primary alkyl < secondary alkyl < tertiary alkyl in this is line with the radical mechanism.

25|$|Either the trans-2-decenoyl {{intermediate}} can be shunted to {{the normal}} saturated fatty acid synthesis pathway by FabB, where the double bond will be hydrolyzed and the final product will be a saturated fatty acid, or FabA will catalyze the <b>isomerization</b> into the cis-3-decenoyl intermediate.|$|E
25|$|Dithienylethene {{derivatives}} {{have shown}} {{different types of}} photochemical side reactions, e.g., oxidation or elimination reactions of the ring-closed isomer and formation of an annulated ring isomer as a byproduct of the photochromic reaction. In order to overcome the first, the 2-position of the thiophenes is substituted with a methyl group, preventing oxidation of the ring closed form. Also often the two free α-positions on the double bond are connected in a 5 or 6-membered ring in order to lock the double bond into the cis-form. This makes the dithienylethene undergo only open-closed ring <b>isomerization,</b> unconfused by E-Z <b>isomerization.</b> More recently, based on recent findings showing that by-product formation most likely occurs exclusively from the lowest singlet excited state, a superior fatigue resistance of dithienylethenes upon visible-light excitation has been achieved by attaching small triplet-sensitizing moieties to the diarylethene core via a -conjugated linkage.|$|E

25|$|Limonene occurs {{commonly}} as the d or (R)-enantiomer, but racemizes to dipentene at 300°C. When warmed with mineral acid, limonene isomerizes to the conjugated diene α-terpinene (which {{can also}} easily {{be converted to}} p-cymene).
