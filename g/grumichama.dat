50|$|Eugenia brasiliensis, {{with common}} names Brazil cherry and <b>grumichama,</b> is {{medium-sized}} tree (maximum 20 meters height) endemic to Brazil which bears small fruits that are purple to black in color, {{and have a}} sweet cherry-like flavor. Its wood is used in carpentry, woodworking and turnery. Its small size favors its use in urban landscaping. Its slow growth and low rate of dispersal make it rare, and it is generally considered as an endangered species.|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Brazil cherry or <b>grumichama</b> is a little-known, underutilized fruit {{species of}} the Myrtaceae family; this tree forms part of CATIE's field {{collection}} of tropical fruits. It is native to southern Brazil and cultivated {{on a small scale}} in Brazil, Paraguay, Florida and Hawaii. Materials and methods. Fruit traits were assessed among 12 seedling trees of the same source of origin, and the potential of fresh fruit and derived products was surveyed among employees and students. Results and discussion. Fruit traits (total soluble solids, fruit weight, fruit diameter, flesh weight, seed weight and number of seeds per fruit) differed significantly among the 12 trees. Survey respondents rated derived products such as yellow jam, (red <b>grumichama</b> + citrus) jam and (red <b>grumichama</b> + mocha) jam higher than fresh fruit, red jam, <b>grumichama</b> wine and juice. Conclusion. Grown in home gardens as an ornamental or as a fruit-bearing tree, or planted as a living fence or windbreak, this fruit crop merits a place in tropical and subtropical settings due to the attractiveness of the tree, its foliage and bloom, its tasty fruit, its contribution to agricultural biodiversity, and the possibility of generating value-added products at the farm, household or community level. For fruit production, vegetative propagation is recommended to retain high quality traits. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
