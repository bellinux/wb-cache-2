Realizing that her son {{would be better off}} in a more stable family environment, Gloria allowed him to move in with the family of Frank Walker, a local youth football coach, who introduced James to basketball when he was nine years old.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Some {{propose that}} the {{question}} of how you know that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry can be adequately answered with the claim that you see that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry. Call this the Perceptual Hypothesis. Here, I examine that hypothesis. I argue that there are two different ways in which the Perceptual Hypothesis could be made true. You might see that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry by seeing his bodily features. Alternatively, you might see that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry by seeing his anger. If you see that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry in the first way, your knowledge is inferential. If you see that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry in the second way, your knowledge is not inferential. These are different ways of knowing that <b>James</b> <b>is</b> angry. So the Perceptual Hypothesis alone does not adequately answer the question of how you know that fact. To ascertain how you know it, we need {{to decide whether or not}} you saw his anger. This is an epistemological argument. But it has consequences for a theory of perception. It implies that there is a determinate fact about which features of an object you see. This fact is made true independently of what you come to know by seeing. In the final section of the paper, I seek to undermine various ways in which the claim that you see James' anger may be thought implausibl...|$|R
5|$|A further {{source of}} {{difference}} between Anne and <b>James</b> <b>was</b> the issue of religion; for example, she abstained from the Anglican communion at her English coronation.

5|$|Anne {{was born}} in the reign of her uncle Charles II, who had no {{legitimate}} children. Her father, <b>James,</b> <b>was</b> thus heir presumptive to the throne. His suspected Roman Catholicism was unpopular in England, and on Charles's instructions Anne and her elder sister, Mary, were raised as Anglicans. Three years after he succeeded Charles, <b>James</b> <b>was</b> deposed in the Glorious Revolution of 1688. Anne's sister and Dutch Protestant brother-in-law and cousin William III of Orange became joint monarchs. Although the sisters had been close, disagreements over Anne's finances, status and choice of acquaintances arose shortly after Mary's accession and they became estranged. William and Mary had no children. After Mary's death in 1694, William reigned alone until his own death in 1702, when Anne succeeded him.|$|E

Rosecrans (his West Point roommate), John Pope, D. H. Hill, Lafayette McLaws, George Pickett, and Ulysses S. Grant, who was of the Class of 1843.
