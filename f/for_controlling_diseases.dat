40|$|Disease {{control by}} {{managers}} {{is a crucial}} response to emerging wildlife epidemics, yet the means of control may be limited by the method of disease transmission. In particular, it is widely held that population reduction, while effective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> that are subject to density-dependent (DD) transmission, is ineffective <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> that are subject to frequency-dependent (FD) transmission. We investigate control for horizontally transmitted diseases with FD transmission where the control is via culling or harvest that is non-selective with respect to infection and the population can compensate through DD recruitment or survival. Using a mathematical model, we show that culling or harvesting can eradicate the disease, even when transmission dynamics are FD. Eradication can be achieved under FD transmission when DD birth or recruitment induces compensatory growth of new, healthy individuals, which has {{the net effect of}} reducing disease prevalence by dilution. We also show that if harvest is used simultaneously with vaccination, and there is high enough transmission coefficient, application of both controls may be less efficient than vaccination alone. We illustrate the effects of these control approaches on disease prevalence for chronic wasting disease in deer where the disease is transmitted directly among deer and through the environment...|$|E

40|$|The {{most common}} {{strategy}} <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by Pseudomonas syringae is, {{as it has}} been for more than 5 decades, to spray bactericides. These mainly include a variety of copper compounds or other heavy metals, with or without various combinations of fungicides or other pest-control chemicals. Spraying with antibiotics or other organic bactericides have also been used, but to a lesser extent. Unfortunately, these strategies have never been satisfactory, resulting in heavy crop losses during severe epidemics. Over the last years, pathogenic strains that are resistant to copper spraying have been detected globally and are threatening the continuation of this strategy. Three different strategies are slowly being introduced into the field, (i) seed disinfection by heat or a combination of heat and bactericides, (ii) biological control by antagonistic microorganisms, and (iii) soil solarization especially against pathogens that spend part of their life cycle in the soil. Additional minor strategies include: (i) spraying infested plants with natural-occuring antibacterial compounds, and (ii) various techniques of sustainable agriculture without the use of chemicals (organic farming) ...|$|E
40|$|Over the years, {{aquaculture}} {{has shown}} increasing development {{in terms of}} production. However, due to intensive farming practices, infectious diseases represent the main problem in fish farms, causing heavy economic losses. The use of antibiotics <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> is widely criticized for its negative impact, including selection of antibioticresistant bacterial strains, immunosuppression, environmental pollution and accumulation of chemical residues in fish tissues. On the other hand, though vaccination {{is the most effective}} prophylactic method of preventing disease outbreaks, the development of effective formulations is often hindered by high production costs and the antigenic heterogeneity of the microbial strains. Recently, there has been increased interest in the possibility of using medicinal herbs as immunostimulants, capable of enhancing immune responses and disease resistance of cultured fish.

30|$|Antimicrobials play a {{significant}} role in the world of medical health and have revolutionized it in different ways. For the past 50  years, antimicrobial drugs have saved countless lives from life-threatening diseases and have eased patients’ suffering. In the present era, the treatment of infections is once again becoming increasingly convoluted because microorganisms are gaining resistance to these “wonder drugs” worldwide (Cantas et al. 2013; Davies and Davies 2010). Therefore, there is an urgent need to search novel bioactive molecules, their chemical characterization and understand the mechanism of action so as to minimize the use of such antibiotics for prophylactic and therapeutic purposes (Savoia 2012). Moreover, for fungi and protozoa, the current chemotherapeutic options are very limited and far from ideal, especially owing to their undesirable side effects or toxicity. This medical crisis has drawn the attention of the scientific community towards studies on the potential of plant-derived substances, an untapped resource of antimicrobial chemotypes, which have long historical usage in traditional pharmacopoeia used in different countries. Plants are rich in several secondary metabolites and are major source of chemical diversity; therefore, they are a potential source of new drugs (Savoia 2012). Medicinal plants have played a critical role in the health and well-being of humans both prophylactically and therapeutically <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> (Upadhyay et al. 2014). Their potential has been well documented in the literature (Ferreira et al. 2006; Arora and Kaur 2007; Onsare et al. 2013; Teiten et al. 2013; Aumeeruddy-Elalfi et al. 2016).|$|E
40|$|Evidence {{indicates}} that the atmospheric and oceanic processes that occur in response to increased greenhouse gases in the broad-scale climate system may already be changing the ecology of infectious diseases. Recent {{studies have shown that}} climate also influences the abundance and ecology of pathogens, and the links between pathogens and changing ocean conditions, including human diseases such as cholera. Vibrio cholerae is well recognized as being responsible for significant mortality and economic loss in developing countries, most often centered in tropical areas of the world. Within the marine environment, V. cholerae is found attached to surfaces provided by plants, filamentous green algae, copepods, crustaceans, and insects. The specific environmental changes that amplified plankton and associated bacterial proliferation and govern the location and timing of plankton blooms have been elucidated. Several studies have demonstrated that environmental non-O 1 and non-O 139 V. cholerae strains and V. cholerae O 1 El Tor and O 139 are able to form a three-dimensional biofilm on surfaces which provides a microenvironment, facilitating environmental persistence within natural aquatic habitats during interepidemic periods. Revealing the influence of climatic/environmental factors in seasonal patterns is critical to understanding temporal variability of cholera at longer time scales to improve disease forecasting. From an applied perspective, clarifying the mechanisms that link seasonal environmental changes to diseases’ dynamics will aid in developing strategies <b>for</b> <b>controlling</b> <b>diseases</b> across a range of human and natural systems...|$|E
