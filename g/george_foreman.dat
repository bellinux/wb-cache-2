25|$|Frazier's {{style was}} often {{compared}} to that of Henry Armstrong and occasionally Rocky Marciano, dependent on bobbing, weaving and relentless pressure to wear down his opponents. His best known punch was a powerful left hook, which accounted for most of his knockouts. In his career he lost to only two fighters, both former Olympic and world heavyweight champions: twice to Muhammad Ali, and twice to <b>George</b> <b>Foreman.</b>|$|E

With a shaved head for a new image Frazier fought well enough, {{somewhat}} more restrained than usual, avoiding walking onto the big shots which he had done in their first match. However, Foreman awaited his moment and then lobbed in a tremendous left hook that lifted Frazier off his feet. After a second knock down it was stopped in the fifth. Shortly after the fight, Frazier announced his retirement.|$|E

25|$|After {{the loss}} to Frazier, Ali fought Jerry Quarry, had a second bout with Floyd Patterson and faced Bob Foster in 1972, winning {{a total of six}} fights that year. In 1973, Ken Norton broke Ali's jaw while giving him the second loss of his career. After {{initially}} considering retirement, Ali won a controversial decision against Norton in their second bout. This led to a rematch with Joe Frazier at Madison Square Garden on January 28, 1974; Frazier had recently lost his title to <b>George</b> <b>Foreman.</b>|$|E
25|$|Norton next beat {{polished}} {{number two}} contender Jimmy Young (who himself had beaten <b>George</b> <b>Foreman</b> and Ron Lyle) via 15-round split decision in a WBC title-elimination bout, with the winner to face reigning WBC champion Ali.

Both boxers fought a smart fight, with Norton using a heavy body attack whilst Young moved well and countered. The decision was controversial, with many observers thinking Young had done enough to win.|$|E

He is also the only boxer to represent Canada at the Summer Olympics and subsequently win a professional world title. Lewis is the only British heavyweight to have won both a Lonsdale belt outright and the world title.|$|E
