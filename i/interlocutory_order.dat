Although these critiques are well-founded, this Article reveals that, as applied in practice, federal courts have drawn sensible lines between <b>interlocutory</b> <b>orders</b> that are immediately appealable {{and those that are}} not.

The court had no jurisdiction to review an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>order</b> granting the employee's motion to strike the affirmative defense under the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C.S. §§ 1-16. The court affirmed the denial of the employer's motion to stay and to compel arbitration. Enforcement of the arbitration policy was not appropriate because the e-mail did not provide minimally sufficient notice to a reasonably prudent employee of the contractual nature of the e-mailed policy and the concomitant waiver of the employee's right to access a judicial forum. The court held that the mass e-mail, which did not require an affirmative response but requested the recipient to review the materials, was not a traditional means for conveying contractually binding terms of employment and did not state directly that the policy contained a mandatory arbitration agreement that would become the employee's exclusive remedy for all claims.|$|E
50|$|Under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 & 2005 if the CAB can {{satisfy the}} High Court {{on the balance}} of probabilities that speciﬁed {{property}} is the proceeds of crime, the court will make an interim order over the property preventing anybody from dealing with it. This order stays in place for 21 days, following which an application is made for an interlocutory hearing, on notice to any person who {{has an interest in}} that property. If it appears to the court that such property is the proceeds of crime, despite anything said by any respondent, an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>order</b> is put in place for a period of seven years. In the course of that time any person who can satisfy the court that the property is not the proceeds of crime can move to have the order lifted. If no such order has been granted during those seven years, the CAB can seek a disposal order effectively extinguishing anybody’s rights to the properties and transferring it to the central exchequer. In April 2014, Deputy Eamonn Maloney sponsored a private members Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Acts. Section 1 of the Bill seeks to reduce the seven-year period to two years. This Bill was listed before the Dáil on Friday 8 May 2015 and is viewed as a move by the Government to toughen the laws on confiscating criminals' assets and similarly is expected to yield a multi-million euro windfall for the taxpayer. As the Bill is a Private Members' Bill, its referral to Select Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality was required pursuant to the Standing Orders 82A and 118.|$|E

Furthermore, Paramupilla, Gopalan's father, who was initially against the CPI, joins Mala and the members of the same party. The drama ends with Paramupilla taking the red flag from Mala symbolizing his change of heart.The counter-drama also contains the same characters and 9 scenes as opposed to 14 in the original drama. The opening scene shows the red flag and deals with the failure of the war waged by Mala and the other members. This introductory scene ends with the entry to a character playing Thoppil Bhasi who says that he has come to see the real condition of Mala. The counter-drama then continues and contains many scenes that have been copied from the drama. However, all of these scenes were followed by commentary criticizing the play and had been authored by Defendant no. 1. Furthermore, the stage was divided into two parts- the upper platform and the lower platform. The scenes copied from the drama were enacted on the upper platform, whereas he criticism of it was enacted on the lower platform.The plaintiffs alleged that the counter-drama had infringed upon their copyright in the drama and filed a suit against the defendants. They also prayed for an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>order</b> restraining the staging of the counter-drama. The Additional District Judge who was hearing the suit granted the interlocutory injunction in favour of the plaintiff. The defendants then appealed to the Kerala High Court and beseeched it to set aside the order restraining them from staging the play.

5000|$|In North Carolina, {{the trial}} court judge may certify an <b>interlocutory</b> <b>order</b> for an appeal. Notably, such {{certification}} is not binding on the North Carolina Court of Appeals, meaning that the North Carolina Court of appeals is free to refuse to review an interlocutory appeal even though {{the trial court}} had certified it. On the other hand, even when the trial court does not certify on order for immediate appeal, the North Carolina Court of Appeals may grant a writ of certiorari to review an interlocutory appeal {{on the basis of}} the so-called [...] "substantial right." [...] Whether the North Carolina Court of Appeals concludes that a substantial right is affected and decides to grant of a writ is not always easily predictable. The North Carolina has adopted a two-part test for the appropriateness of an appeal of an interlocutory order: Whether a substantial right is affected by the challenged order and whether this substantial right might be lost, prejudiced, or inadequately preserved in the absence of an immediate appeal. As the North Carolina Court of Appeals itself said on many occasions, [...] "the substantial right test is more easily stated than applied." [...] Some rights that the North Carolina Court of Appeals has recently found to be substantial are: the right to conduct business and get paid.A notable exception to the rule that all orders are interlocutory until the final issue is resolved is the issue of unresolved attorney's fees. In 2013, the Supreme Court of North Carolina clarified that all appeals can and must be taken from the trial courts' orders even if the attorney's fees were still unresolved. In 2013 the North Carolina lawmaking body substantially liberalized the appeals from the decisions of North Carolina family law courts (i.e., the divorce courts, applying N.C. Gen. Stat. §50). Until 2013, the litigants had to wait until the trial court resolved all divorce related issues until they could appeal any of the trial court's orders. For instance, an order resolving alimony could not be appealed until the court also resolved child support, division of property, and child custody. [...] The new law N.C. Gen. Stat. 50-19.1 allows divorcing spouses to appeal each of these unrelated orders as soon as they are entered.|$|E
