25|$|A {{liquid ring}} pump is a {{rotating}} positive displacement pump that is powered by an induction motor and is typically used as a vacuum pump or as a <b>gas</b> <b>compressor.</b> The {{liquid ring pump}} was invented in 1905 by Lewis H. Nash. Production soon began thereafter at the Nash Engineering Company. Nash filed U.S. patent #1,091,529 on February 24, 1910 and was issued to him on March 31, 1914.|$|E
25|$|LaGuardia Depot {{is located}} on a two-block long {{structure}} (85-01 24th Avenue) bound by 85th and 87th Street, and 23rd and 24th Avenues in the East Elmhurst & Jackson Heights neighborhoods of Queens, New York near LaGuardia Airport. The depot was opened on January 15, 1954, is owned by GTJ Reit Inc, and was operated by Triboro Coach Corporation before being leased to the City of New York and operated by MTA Bus Company on February 20, 2006 {{for a period of}} 21 years. In 1989, a methanol fuel station was installed at the facility for six General Motors-built RTS methanol buses. It was later used in the early 1990s to fuel an NYCT demonstration bus from the Casey Stengel Depot and three new Triboro-operated RTS buses fitted with special Detroit Diesel Series 92 engines. Beginning in 1994, the facility dispatched compressed natural gas (CNG) buses in addition to its diesel fleet. The depot was decommissioned from CNG operations in 2006 due to not meeting the MTA's safety and environmental standards. On April 10, 2006, while workers from KeySpan were removing CNG from tanks and a private contractor was conducting construction near the depot, a <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> station exploded leading to a large fire at the depot. One bus was destroyed and 12 were damaged. Also, work to modify this depot to accommodate articulated-buses is almost completed.|$|E

2500|$|One {{observation}} {{is that while}} current [...] "best practice" [...] heat pumps (ground source system, operating between 0°C and 35°C) have a typical COP around 4, no better than 5, the maximum achievable is 8.8 because of fundamental Carnot cycle limits. This means that in the coming decades, the energy efficiency of top-end heat pumps could roughly double. Cranking up efficiency requires {{the development of a}} better <b>gas</b> <b>compressor,</b> fitting HVAC machines with larger heat exchangers with slower gas flows, and solving internal lubrication problems resulting from slower gas flow.|$|E

2500|$|Since {{ethylene}} {{production is}} energy intensive, much {{effort has been}} dedicated to recovering heat from the gas leaving the furnaces. Most of the energy recovered from the cracked gas is used to make high pressure (1200 psig) steam. This steam is in turn used to drive the turbines for compressing cracked gas, the propylene refrigeration compressor, and the ethylene refrigeration compressor. An ethylene plant, once running, {{does not need to}} import steam to drive its steam turbines. A typical world scale ethylene plant (about 1.5 billion pounds of ethylene per year) uses a [...] cracked <b>gas</b> <b>compressor,</b> a [...] propylene compressor, and a [...] ethylene compressor.|$|E
2500|$|The {{mayor of}} Dish, Texas complained that air {{pollution}} from a natural <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> station was sickening his family. However, in May 2010, The Texas Department of State Health Services released air quality results for DISH, including tests {{of blood and}} urine samples from 28 DISH residents that were tested for volatile organic compounds (VOCs). The agency concluded: “The information obtained from this investigation did not indicate that community-wide exposures from gas wells or compressor stations were occurring in the sample population. This conclusion {{was based on the}} pattern of VOC values found in the samples. Other sources of exposure such as cigarette smoking, the presence of disinfectant by-products in drinking water, and consumer or occupational/hobby related products could explain many of the findings.” ...|$|E
2500|$|With trimix, {{measured}} {{pressures of}} oxygen and helium are decanted into a cylinder, which is [...] "topped up" [...] with {{air from the}} diving <b>gas</b> <b>compressor,</b> resulting in a three gas mix of oxygen, helium and nitrogen.

Both NAUI and TDI offer courses using a trimix that they call [...] "helitrox", blended by the latter method, which limit the fraction of helium to about 17–20%. Mixtures made by blending helium with nitrox containing around one-third oxygen such as EAN32 (a common premixed nitrox) have the desirable property that at their maximum operating depth for a partial pressure of oxygen of 1.4 bar, their equivalent narcotic depth is always approximately , a safe limit.|$|E

50|$|In some cases, a {{so-called}} bypass valve {{acts as a}} relief valve by being used to return {{all or part of}} the fluid discharged by a pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> back to either a storage reservoir or the inlet of the pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor.</b> This is done to protect the pump or <b>gas</b> <b>compressor</b> and any associated equipment from excessive pressure. The bypass valve and bypass path can be internal (an integral part of the pump or compressor) or external (installed as a component in the fluid path). Many fire engines have such relief valves to prevent the overpressurization of fire hoses.|$|E
