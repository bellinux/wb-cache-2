50|$|A {{film crew}} {{is a group}} of people, hired by a {{production}} company, for the purpose of producing a film or motion picture. The crew is distinguished from the cast as the cast are understood to be the actors who appear {{in front of the camera}} or provide voices for characters in the film. The crew is also separate from the producers as the producers are the ones who own a portion of either the film company or the film's intellectual property rights. A film crew is divided into different departments, each of which specializes in a specific aspect of the production. Film crew positions have evolved over the years, spurred by technological change, but many traditional <b>jobs</b> <b>date</b> from the early 20th century and are common across jurisdictions and film-making cultures.|$|R

40|$|A resume is an {{easy and}} {{organized}} way to present yourself to an employer. It tells the employer how to contact you, what prior jobs you have had, what special skills you have, volunteer and work experiences you’ve had and about your education. Basically, a resume provides insight into {{who you are and}} what type of employee you might be. Another reason to have a resume is that when you are filling out applications for jobs, often you will need to have the full title of your former <b>jobs,</b> <b>dates</b> of employments, and names of former supervisors. If you bring a resume when you are searching for a job, it will make it much easier to fill out an application.
