25|$|Both Heirens and {{his parents}} signed a confession. The parties agreed to a date of July 30 for Heirens to make his {{official}} confession. On that date the defense went to Tuohy's office, where several reporters were assembled to ask Heirens questions and where Tuohy himself made a speech. Heirens appeared bewildered and gave noncommittal answers to reporters' questions, which he years later blamed on Tuohy:It was Tuohy himself. After assembling all the officials, including attorneys and policemen, he began a preamble about how long everyone had waited to get a confession from me, but, at last, the truth {{was going to be}} told. He kept emphasizing the word 'truth' and I asked him if he really wanted the truth. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> that he did...Now Tuohy made a big deal about hearing the truth. Now, when I was being forced to lie to save myself. It made me angry...so I told them the truth, and everyone got very upset.|$|E

According to NFL Spokesman Steve Alic, [...] "I can tell you absolutely that the score that has been reported on the Internet is inaccurate. I spoke {{to the person who}} graded the test, and <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> that that number was not correct." [...] The next day, the test was readministered and Young allegedly scored a 16.|$|E
2500|$|The {{black-and-white}} photos dated back to {{the summer}} of 1982 (after her freshman year at Syracuse University) when she worked as an assistant and makeup artist for Mount Kisco, New York photographer Tom Chiapel. Williams stated {{at the time that}} Chiapel said that [...] "he had a concept of having two models pose nude for silhouettes. Basically to make different shapes and forms. The light would be behind the models. I was reluctant, but since <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> that I would be the only one to see them and I would not be identifiable in the photographs, I agreed. He had also gotten another model to agree to this." [...] In a 2012 interview with NPR, Williams discussed these events stating that her mother: ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have been}} to see Foudroye, the great oculist. He has {{examined}} my eyes carefully, and <b>he</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> positively that my eyesight is completely sound. In two months' time I shall see {{as well as any}} one!" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "To no extent at all," [...] <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "By the by, {{as regards}} that packet; {{would you mind}} just {{slipping}} it under this newspaper?" ...|$|E
6000|$|The Chevalier {{shrugged his}} shoulders. 'What know I?' he said. 'For {{those who have}} a fine nose for {{brimstone}} there may be, but <b>he</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> it is but the white magic practiced in Egypt, and the boy is Christian!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why," [...] pursued my friend, [...] "there is Mr. B., my next-door neighbor--'tis {{enough to}} make one sick {{of life in the}} city to spend a week out on his farm. Such princely living as one gets! And <b>he</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> that it costs him very little--scarce {{anything}} perceptible, in fact." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not so, noble admiral," [...] put in Vicente Yañez, {{to sustain}} his brother.

60|$|But trying my best {{to chase}} away these misgivings, he at last gave them over. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> I might count upon him to his uttermost keel.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{can feel}} quite safe on that point," [...] <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I was her counsel--that is, {{if it is}} the same woman. How was she dressed?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... “You’ll be {{all right}} in half-an-hour,” <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> “And I promise I won’t use any more {{physical}} demonstrations. Get up now. You can sit on a chair.” ...|$|E

60|$|The {{heart is}} a little relieved, when vexation {{converts}} itself into anger. But from this privilege I am utterly precluded by my own epistolary sins and negligences. Yet in very troth thou must be a hard-hearted fellow to let me trot for four weeks together every Thursday to the Bear Inn--to receive no letter. I have sometimes thought that Milton the carrier did not deliver my last parcel, but <b>he</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> <b>he</b> did.|$|R
6000|$|... 'He never {{talks to}} me much of himself. We were {{speaking}} of my new book,--my novel. <b>He</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> most positively that he had nothing further {{to do with the}} paper.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... "So my late brother, Baron Wychecombe, always treated it, Sir Gervaise. <b>He</b> once <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> {{that the}} twelve judges were clearly against the claim, {{and that the}} Stuarts had nothing to expect from them." ...|$|R

60|$|Before I could exclaim, <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> that he {{had taken}} no liberty, {{that he had}} not intruded. He was called in. Otherwise he would not have dreamed of {{breaking}} in upon Heyst's privacy.|$|E
60|$|Certainly he had, <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> I {{told him}} about the date and his head and {{shoulders}} disappeared into a cupboard. In a few minutes he withdrew them and called out sharply for his assistant.|$|E
5000|$|In April 2015, Grealish {{was warned}} by Aston Villa manager Tim Sherwood after The Sun {{published}} images showing him allegedly inhaling nitrous oxide for recreational purposes.

But, as I said about Raheem last week, he's a young man, he was even younger a year earlier when the picture was taken." ...|$|R
40|$|Last autumn {{marked the}} 25 th anni-versary of the {{discovery}} of “Lucy. ” While that certainly was a momentous event in paleoanthropology, it had no less profound an effect on my aca-demic life, for it presaged my eventual seduction into the arena of hominid fossil interpretation. My friend John Fleagle, editor of Evolutionary An-thropology, says I may introduce this paper with a history of that experi-ence. <b>He</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> this is appropri-ate because I have now reached the age when young people in the field have no idea who I am...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have already}} spoken to your father, and I have his permission. I may say more. <b>He</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> that <b>he</b> hopes I may succeed." [...] He paused a moment, but she {{remained}} quite tranquil. He watched her, {{and could see}} that the delicate pink on her cheek was a little heightened, and that a streak of colour showed itself on her fair brow; but there was nothing in her manner to give him either promise of success or assurance of failure. [...] "You will know what I mean?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am sorry," [...] he said, [...] "that my {{interest}} in the child has annoyed you. At any rate, it is over now. The parson was mysterious, but <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me</b> that she was provided for." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{realize the}} {{position}} entirely, my dear fellow," [...] <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "I am glad you {{have opened the}} subject up. I have been bursting to {{tell you all about}} it; but I have hesitated for fear of being misunderstood." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have people}} of every class, monsieur," [...] <b>he</b> <b>assured</b> <b>me.</b> [...] "One comes and tells his friends, and they come, and so on. I {{believe that there}} was a Chinese gentleman here to-night. One does not notice. We were busy." ...|$|E
60|$|P.S.--The {{worst of}} it {{is that there is no}} mystery; that was the {{invention}} of Jack Raynor, to arouse my curiosity. James is not a Thug. <b>He</b> solemnly <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> that in all his wanderings he has never set foot in Sepoy.|$|R

60|$|SIR:--Yours of the 31st ult. was {{received}} yesterday about noon, {{and since then}} I have been giving most earnest attention to the subject-matter of it. At my call General Schenck has attended, and <b>he</b> <b>assures</b> <b>me</b> it is almost certain that violence will be used {{at some of the}} voting places on election day unless prevented by his provost-guards. He says that at some of those places Union voters will not attend at all, or run a ticket, unless they have some assurance of protection. This makes the Missouri case, of my action in regard to which you express your approval.|$|R
