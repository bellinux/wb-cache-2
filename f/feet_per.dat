5|$|Nanticoke Creek loses {{water to}} mines and also {{receives}} abandoned mine drainage discharges from them. The Truesdale Mine Discharge, {{which is also}} known as the Dundee Outfall, discharges into the creek. In low-flow conditions, its flow ranges from 0 to 38 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> second. A smaller abandoned mine drainage discharge with a discharge of 0.01 to 0.06 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> second also discharges into the creek.

5|$|Some {{water from}} the Shamokin Creek {{watershed}} enters the Mahanoy Creek watershed via various mine tunnels, mainly the Doutyville, Helfenstein, the Locust Gap, and the Centralia Mine discharges. Water from Mahanoy Creek also flows through mine tunnels into Shamokin Creek. The discharge of the creek at various locations ranges from 0 to 320 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> second. The discharge of acid mine drainage in the creek ranges from 0 to 17.2 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> second. In 2001, the discharge was typically found to be higher in March than in August.|$|E

5|$|The {{discharge}} of Kettle Creek at the USGS gauge at Westport ranged from 4 to 6280 cubic <b>feet</b> <b>per</b> second between 1970 and 2006.

The pH of the watershed ranges from 5.5 to 8.6. The alkalinity concentration of {{the waters of the}} creek ranged from 20 to 25 milligrams per liter in the 1950s and 1960s, but decreased to 11 to 15 milligrams per liter by 1993.
