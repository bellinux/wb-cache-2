40|$|International audienceIstradefylline (KW- 6002), an {{adenosine}} A 2 A receptor antagonist, is used adjunct with optimal {{doses of}} L- 3, 4 -dihydroxyphenylalanine (l-DOPA) to extend on-time in Parkinson's disease (PD) patients experiencing motor fluctuations. Clinical application of <b>istradefylline</b> {{for the management}} of other l-DOPA-induced complications, both motor and non-motor related (i. e. dyskinesia and cognitive impairments), remains to be determined. In this study, acute effects of <b>istradefylline</b> (60 - 100 mg/kg) alone, or with optimal and sub-optimal doses of l-DOPA, were evaluated in two monkey models of PD (i) the gold-standard 1 -methyl- 4 -phenyl- 1, 2, 3, 6 -tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) -treated macaque model of parkinsonian and dyskinetic motor symptoms and (ii) the chronic low dose (CLD) MPTP-treated macaque model of cognitive (working memory and attentional) deficits. Behavioural analyses in l-DOPA-primed MPTP-treated macaques showed that <b>istradefylline</b> alone specifically alleviated postural deficits. When combined with an optimal l-DOPA treatment dose, <b>istradefylline</b> increased on-time, enhanced therapeutic effects on bradykinesia and locomotion, but exacerbated dyskinesia. <b>Istradefylline</b> treatment at specific doses with a sub-optimal l-DOPA specifically alleviated bradykinesia. Cognitive assessments in CLD MPTP-treated macaques showed that the attentional and working memory deficits caused by l-DOPA were lowered after <b>istradefylline</b> administration. Taken together, these data support a broader clinical use of <b>istradefylline</b> as an adjunct treatment in PD, where specific treatment combinations can be utilised to manage various l-DOPA-induced complications, which importantly, maintain a desired anti-parkinsonian response...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBackground: Studies of <b>istradefylline</b> (KW 6002), an {{adenosine}} A 2 A-receptor antagonist, {{have provided}} evidence of its efficacy as a nondopaminergic antiparkinsonian drug. Antiparkinsonian drugs {{have also had}} efficacy in treating restless legs syndrome (RLS). Objectives: The aims {{of this study were}} to assess the effectiveness and tolerability of <b>istradefylline</b> in the treatment of RLS. Methods: This was a single-center, multiparametric, prospective trial of <b>istradefylline</b> as a treatment for moderate to severe idiopathic RLS. It was conducted at the Shands/Jacksonville Sleep Disorders Center, University of Florida, Jacksonville, Florida, from March 2003 to October 2003. Patients received a single PO 80 -mg dose QD of <b>istradefylline</b> in the late afternoon or early evening for 6 weeks. Appropriate tolerability evaluations (ie, vital assessments, physical examination, clinical laboratory tests, and electrocardiogram) were performed at screening, while on study drug, and after withdrawal of study drug. Results: Fifteen participants (mean [SD] age, 61 [7. 1] years; range, 50 - 69 years) were screened for enrollment. The mean duration of RLS was 18 years. Of the 15 potential patients, 6 did not meet entry criteria, 2 withdrew consent, 1 had not completed baseline procedures at the time of study suspension, and 1 was excluded for administrative reasons. Therefore, a total of 5 patients received the study drug. Of these, 3 (60 %) patients responded favorably to <b>istradefylline</b> treatment. Improvement in the periodic limb movement index was observed in 3 patients compared with baseline (patients 2, 4, and 5 [index score: 6, 4, 9 vs 50, 35, 18, respectively]). Improvement in the International RLS Rating Scale scores was observed in 3 patients compared with baseline (patients 2, 4, and 5 [index score: 7, 23, 9 vs 35, 25, 20, respectively]). There was a return to baseline severity in 2 of the 3 patients after withdrawal of study drug. Improvement in RLS symptoms was observed in 3 patients treated with <b>istradefylline</b> for 6 weeks. A clinical worsening of baseline insomnia was observed in 2 patients. Conclusions: Although we could not definitively conclude a beneficial effect based on this small exploratory trial, we found the data to be encouraging. The study drug was well tolerated. Further study of this compound in the treatment of RLS is justified...|$|E

40|$|Latest {{results on}} the action of {{adenosine}} A 2 A receptor antagonists indicate their potential therapeutic usefulness {{in the treatment of}} Parkinson’s disease. Basal ganglia possess high levels of adenosine A 2 A receptors, mainly on the external surfaces of neurons located at the indirect tracts between the striatum, globus pallidus, and substantia nigra. Experiments with animal models of Parkinson’s disease indicate that adenosine A 2 A receptors are strongly involved in the regulation of the central nervous system. Co-localization of adenosine A 2 A and dopaminergic D 2 receptors in striatum creates a milieu for antagonistic interaction between adenosine and dopamine. The experimental data prove that the best improvement of mobility in patients with Parkinson’s disease could be achieved with simultaneous activation of dopaminergic D 2 receptors and inhibition of adenosine A 2 A receptors. In animal models of Parkinson’s disease, the use of selective antagonists of adenosine A 2 A receptors, such as <b>istradefylline,</b> led to the reversibility of movement dysfunction. These compounds might improve mobility during both monotherapy and co-administration with L-DOPA and dopamine receptor agonists. The use of adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists in combination therapy enables the reduction of the L-DOPA doses, as well as a reduction of side effects. In combination therapy, the adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists might be used in both moderate and advanced stages of Parkinson’s disease. The long-lasting administration of adenosine A 2 A receptor antagonists does not decrease the patient response and does not cause side effects typical of L-DOPA therapy. It was demonstrated in various animal models that inhibition of adenosine A 2 A receptors not only decreases the movement disturbance, but also reveals a neuroprotective activity, which might impede or stop the progression of the disease. Recently, clinical trials were completed on the use of <b>istradefylline</b> (KW- 6002), an inhibitor of adenosine A 2 A receptors, as an anti-Parkinson drug...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Poly-substituted {{xanthine}} derivatives are {{an important}} class of compounds in medicinal chemistry. Substitution at the 8 -position of the purine ring is generally accessible by ring closure of a carboxamido-substituted uracil precursor. Although several procedures to accomplish this synthetic step have been suggested, it still remains difficult in many cases. Results Ring closure reaction with hexamethyldisilazane was studied under microwave conditions. Reaction times were dramatically reduced by the application of microwaves in the syntheses of the 8 -styrylxanthine derivative <b>istradefylline,</b> and {{in the preparation of}} 2 -substituted pyrimido [1, 2, 3 - cd]purines. Furthermore, the new procedure allowed the preparation of a previously unaccessible diazepino [1, 2, 3 - cd]purine. Yields were generally improved by the new method. The addition of THF as a co-solvent proved to be crucial. Conclusion A new, fast, and efficient ring closure method for the imidazole ring of xanthine derivatives and related tricyclic compounds has been developed. Apart from improving the syntheses of known compounds, some of which are important pharmacological tools or in development as novel drugs, it allows the preparation of 2 -substituted diazepino [1, 2, 3 - cd]purines – a new class of tricyclic purine derivatives. </p...|$|E
40|$|Adenosine {{derived from}} the {{degradation}} of ATP/AMP functions as a signalling molecule in the nervous system through the occupation of A 1, A 2, and A 3 adenosine receptors. Adenosine A 2 A receptors have a selective localization to the basal ganglia and specifically to the indirect output pathway, {{and as a consequence}} offer a unique opportunity to modulate the output from the striatum that is believed critical to the occurrence of motor components of PD. Indeed, the ability of A 2 A antagonists to modulate basal ganglia neurotransmission {{has been shown to be}} associated with improved motor function in experimental models of PD. This suggests that A 2 A antagonists would be effective as a symptomatic treatment in humans without provoking marked dyskinesia. Indeed, the A 2 A antagonist <b>istradefylline</b> reduces OFF time in moderate- to late-stage patients with PD already receiving dopaminergic therapy, with an increase in non-troublesome dyskinesia. Adenosine and adenosine receptors also exert actions relevant to pathogenesis in PD, raising the possibility of their use as neuroprotective agents. Both epidemiologic evidence and the current preclinical data strongly support a role for A 2 A antagonists in protecting dopaminergic neurons and influencing the onset and progression of P...|$|E

40|$|Objective: The aim of {{this study}} was to {{summarize}} recent studies on nondopaminergic options for the treatment of motor symptoms in Parkinson's disease (PD). Data Sources: Papers in English published in PubMed, Cochrane, and Ovid Nursing databases between January 1988 and November 2016 were searched using the following keywords: PD, nondopaminergic therapy, adenosine, glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminic, and iron chelator. We also reviewed the ongoing clinical trials in the website of clinicaltrials. gov. Study Selection: Articles related to the nondopaminergic treatment of motor symptoms in PD were selected for this review. Results: PD is conventionally treated with dopamine replacement strategies, which are effective in the early stages of PD. Long-term use of levodopa could result in motor complications. Recent studies revealed that nondopaminergic systems such as adenosine, glutamatergic, adrenergic, serotoninergic, histaminic, and iron chelator pathways could include potential therapeutic targets for motor symptoms, including motor fluctuations, levodopa-induced dyskinesia, and gait disorders. Some nondopaminergic drugs, such as <b>istradefylline</b> and amantadine, are currently used clinically, while most such drugs are in preclinical testing stages. Transitioning of these agents into clinically beneficial strategies requires reliable evaluation since several agents have failed to show consistent results despite positive findings at the preclinical level. Conclusions: Targeting nondopaminergic transmission could improve some motor symptoms in PD, especially the discomfort of dyskinesia. Although nondopaminergic treatments show great potential in PD treatment as an adjunct therapy to levodopa, further investigation is required to ensure their success...|$|E
40|$|The drug {{treatment}} of Parkinson’s disease (PD) {{is accompanied by}} a loss of drug efficacy, the onset of motor complications, lack of effect on non-motor symptoms, and a failure to modify disease progression. As a consequence, novel approaches to therapy are sought, and adenosine A 2 A receptors (A 2 AARs) provide a viable target. A 2 AARs are highly localized to the basal ganglia and specifically to the indirect output pathway, which is highly important in the control of voluntary movement. A 2 AAR antagonists can modulate γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) and glutamate release in basal ganglia and other key neurotransmitters that modulate motor activity. In both rodent and primate models of PD, A 2 AAR antagonists produce alterations in motor behavior, either alone or in combination with dopaminergic drugs, which suggest that they will be effective in the symptomatic treatment of PD. In clinical trials, the A 2 AAR antagonist <b>istradefylline</b> reduces “off” time in patients with PD receiving optimal dopaminergic therapy. However, these effects have proven difficult to demonstrate on a consistent basis, and further clinical trials are required to establish the clinical utility of this drug class. Based on preclinical studies, A 2 AAR antagonists may also be neuroprotective and have utility in the treatment of neuropsychiatric disorders. We are only now starting to explore the range of potential uses of A 2 AAR antagonists in central nervous system disorders, and their full utility is still to be uncovered...|$|E

Additional post hoc analyses were conducted to compare the effect of the combination with the effect of the drugs alone. Motor activity improved significantly and was sustained for longer when the drugs were given in combination than when administered separately at the same dose. Similarly, when tested as add-on treatment to L-Dopa, the combinations resulted in higher levels of contralateral rotation in comparison to the single drugs. Of special interest, the activity observed with some combinations could not be described by a simplistic additive effect and involved more subtle synergistic pharmacological interactions. The combined administration of A 2 A/NR 2 B-receptor antagonists improved motor behaviour in 6 -OHDA rats.

40|$|Parkinson’s disease (PD) is a chronic, {{progressive}} {{disease of the}} central nervous system (CNS),characterized by a slow loss of dopaminergic neurons in the substantia nigra, leading to significantdecrease in dopamine (DA) levels in the striatum. Currently used drugs, such as levodopa(L-DOPA), amantadine, dopamine agonists (D) or anticholinergic drugs, are not effective enough,and do not eliminate the causes of disease. Many research centers are conducting researchon new forms of currently used drugs (e. g. Duodopa, XP 21279, IPX 066), new drugs of alreadyknown groups (e. g. safinamide), medicines that suppress side effects of L-DOPA (e. g. AFQ 056,fipamezole), and, finally, compounds with a novel mechanism of action (e. g. PMY 50028, A 2 Areceptor antagonists). A lot of scientific reports indicate an important role of A 2 A receptorsin the regulation of the central movement system, so a new group of compounds – selectiveantagonists of A 2 A receptors (e. g. <b>istradefylline,</b> preladenant, SYN 115) – has been developed and their potential use in PD has been examined. Clinical studies of A 2 A receptor antagonistshave shown that this group of compounds can shorten off periods {{and at the same time}} theydo not worsen dyskinesias in patients with PD. Moreover, there is ongoing research on newforms of treatment, such as gene therapy. Attempts to apply the viral vector AAV- 2, whichwill be able to infect neurons with a variety of genes, including the gene of glutamate decarboxylase(GAD), neurturin (NTN), or aromatic L-amino acid decarboxylase, are currently beingcarried out.

40|$|Over {{a period}} of more than 50 years, the {{symptomatic}} treatment of the motor symptoms of Parkinson disease (PD) has been optimized using pharmacotherapy, deep brain stimulation, and physiotherapy. The arsenal of pharmacotherapies includes L-Dopa, several dopamine agonists, inhibitors of monoamine oxidase (MAO) -B and catechol-o-methyltransferase (COMT), and amantadine. In the later course of the disease, motor complications occur, at which stage different oral formulations of L-Dopa or dopamine agonists with long half-life, a transdermal application or parenteral pumps for continuous drug supply can be subscribed. Alternatively, the patient is offered deep brain stimulation of the subthalamic nucleus (STN) or the internal part of the globus pallidus (GPi). For a more efficacious treatment of motor complications, new formulations of L-Dopa, dopamine agonists, and amantadine {{as well as new}} MAO-B and COMT inhibitors are currently tested in clinical trials, and some of them already yielding positive results in phase 3 trials. In addition, non-dopaminergic agents have been tested in the early clinical phase for the treatment of motor fluctuations and dyskinesia, including adenosine A 2 A antagonists (<b>istradefylline,</b> preladenant, and tozadenant) and modulators of the metabolic glutamate receptor 5 (mGluR 5 - mavoglurant) and serotonin (eltoprazine) receptors. Recent clinical trials testing coenzyme Q 10, the dopamine agonist pramipexole, creatine monohydrate, pioglitazone, or AAV-mediated gene therapy aimed at increasing expression of neurturin, did not prove efficacious. Treatment with nicotine, caffeine, inosine (a precursor of urate), and isradipine (a dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker), as well as active and passive immunization against α-synuclein and inhibitors or modulators of α-synuclein-aggregation are currently studied in clinical trials. However, to date, no disease-modifying treatment is available. We here review the current status of treatment options for motor and non-motor symptoms, and discuss current investigative strategies for disease modification. This review provides basic insights, mainly addressing basic scientists and non-specialists. It stresses the need to intensify therapeutic PD research and points out reasons why the translation of basic research to disease-modifying therapies has been unsuccessful so far...|$|E
