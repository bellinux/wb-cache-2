Although traditional osteointegrated implants provide good anchorage (Ödman et al., 1988; Roberts et al., 1989; Wehrbein and Merz, 1998), they are too bulky for some applications, and therefore, miniscrews [microscrews or temporary anchorage devices (TADs) ] are often preferred (Kanomi, 1997; Ohmae et al., 2001; Miyawaki et al., 2003).

40|$|A {{particularly}} interesting {{point is the}} effect of an-nealing the completed <b>evices,</b> i. e., with A 1 metall iza-tion in place, at 230 ~ in air for from 2 to 60 hr (re-ferred to as A 1 BAKE). This treatment brings the C 77 oK/C 300 oK ratio to 1. 000 __+ 0. 003, which is as close to unity as we can measure. The reduction of the tem-perature sensitivity is attributed to the removal of water or of the water-SiO 2 reaction product and is demonstrated ven more clearly in the case where the oxide has previously been exposed to T&H. The A 1 presumably reacts with the water or water-SiO 2 reac-tion product to form A 1203 and some form of hydro-gen. This picture is supported by the fact that in a similar experiment (not shown in Fig. 4) on HT SlOe in which gold, a nonreactive metal, was used in place of A 1, there was no change in C 77 oK/C 300 oK. Since pre-viously Hu and Young (7) and Burkhardt (8) have found no reaction between A 1 and thermal SiO 2 below 400 ~ we believe that the present results associated with A 1 BAKE are totally attributable to an A 1 -H 20 reaction. If the A 1 is removed by wet chemical etching after the A 1 bake and a fresh A 1 metallization is applied, the C 77 oK/C 3 oooK ratio reverts to the pre-A 1 BAKE value of 0. 99 (see A 1 REMOVE in Fig. 4). It is, there-fore, thought hat the last 1 % difference is due directly or indirectly to H 20 retained in just the surface layers of the SIO 2. It {{is interesting to note that}} Balk (9), Deal et al. (10), and Sedgwick and Krongelb (11) have all postu-lated that A 1 reacts with residual H 20 in SiO 2 to pro-duce atomic hydrogen. The atomic hydrogen is thought to be responsible for the removal of surface states on Si surfaces or for the induced effective negative charge on Ge surfaces. The present work supports this hy-pothesis by showing that under certain conditions A 1 does interact with SiO 2 films resulting in a decrease in temperature sensitivity of the capacitance. This fact is most readily accounted for postulating that the A 1 reacts to remove some form of H 20 in the SiO 2 films. The capacitance hange with temperature effect re-ported on above would seem to be a relatively easy nondestructive t chnique for the determination f H 20 or water produced reaction products in SiO 2 films on completed <b>evices...</b>|$|R
40|$|International audienceResistive {{switching}} {{offers a}} promising route to universal electronic memory, potentially replacing current {{technologies that are}} approaching their fundamental limits. In many cases switching originates from the reversible formation and dissolution of nanometre-scale conductive filaments, which constrain the motion of electrons, leading to the quantisation of device conductance into multiples of the fundamental unit of conductance, G 0. Such quantum effects appear when the constriction diameter approaches the Fermi wavelength of the electron in the medium – typically several nanometres. Here {{we find that the}} conductance of silicon-rich silica (SiO x) resistive switches is quantised in half-integer multiples of G 0. In contrast to other resistive switching systems this quantisation is intrinsic to SiO x, and is not due to drift of metallic ions. Half-integer quantisation is explained in terms of the filament structure and formation mechanism, which allows us to distinguish between systems that exhibit integer and half-integer quantisation.

The optimum treatment con-sists of exposing the base materials to a nitrogen plasma for 1 min while maintaining the base materials at 250 ~ Films deposited on thermal oxide base materials which have first been treated by this new method were found to have the same deposition rate, aqueous HF etch rate, and surface morphology as those films deposited on untreated bare silicon. In addi-tion to a nitrogen plasma, oxygen and argon plasmas were studied and found to produce similar esults when the base ma-terial temperature was raised to 350 ~ The elimination of base material dependence through the use of this new plasma treatment technique has resulted in higher integrity TEOS/O 3 oxides and has also expanded the range of applications for this unique planarizing technology for very large scale integrated <b>evice</b> fabrication. Tetraethoxysilane (TEOS) is increasingly being used as a silicon (oxide) source material for atmospheric pressure...|$|E
40|$|Fig. 1. DTA curves for ZnO-B 203 -PbO-Si 02 {{passivation}} glasses {{using the}} Rigaku DTA system, {{are given in}} Fig. 1, where % is glass transition point (log V = 13. 3), M e is deforma-tion point (log V = 11. 0), T ~ is softening point (log V = 7. 6), Tsi,t is sintering point (log V = 6. 0), and Tr is flow point (log V = 5. 0). The heating rate for measuring DTA curves was 10 ~ As listed in Table II, Tg, Tf, and the other points are raised {{with an increase in}} SiO 2 and a decrease in B 203, regardless of the amount of ZnO and PbO. As the Al~O 3, P 20 ~, and ZnF 2 contents are small, it seems likely that they do not affect the variations in glass viscosity points. Typical infrared absorption spectra are repre-sented in Fig. 2, which exhibit sharp absorption bands nearly at 2. 7 nm, caused by OH stretching vibration. Com-pared with the spectrum for an untreated glass without fluoride, the OH absorption band removal was carried out completely by dry air bubbling treatment for a fluoride containing molten glass. Low flow point and OH-free glasses are suitable for semiconductor device passivations, because they are not harmful to the reliabil-ity and I-V curves of passivated <b>evices...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{modeling}} of heat transfer inside a vacuum packaged MEMS 4 <b>evices</b> has been performed by several researchers mostly through ijdonte Carlo simulations. In this work, we employ an analytical approach {{to study the}} heat transport of gas inside a high vacuum enclosure. In this pressure range, the interaction between gas molecules is negligible compared to their interaction with the walls, qnd hence the gas is treated as the free-molecule gas. The heated cantilever is modeled as a uniform beam with a rectangular cross Section located at a certain distance away from the bottom wall which Could represent a substrate in the real device. To account for various Situations, the temperatures of the surrounding walls are allowed {{to be different from}} each other and {{different from that of the}} beam and the Substrate. The temperature contour and the heat flux are obtained from fie analytical approach. A molecular simulation code based on the direct simulation Monte Carlo (DSMC) has been developed and employed to validate the analytical results and excellent agreements have been obtained. The effects of incomplete thermal accommodation are also investigated. It is anticipated that the developed analytical Solutions would be very valuable to the design of Pirani sensors and 0 ther MEMS devices utilizing micro heaters, for example, the thermal sensing atomic force microscope.

40|$|Surface {{damage on}} GaAs induced by etching using an {{electron}} cyclotron resonance (ECR) source has been studied {{as a function of}} pressure, microwave power, sample distance from the ECR source, RF power, and gas composition. Damage was evaluated by measuring the current-voltage (I-V) and capacitance-voltage (C-V) characteristics on Schottky diodes fabricated on the etched surface. Etch-induced damage is found to depend mainly on the ion energy and the concentration of reactive species. The diode characteristics are improved when the samples are etched at lower pressure, higher mi-crowave power, and closer distance to the ECR source. The diodes become more leaky and the intercept voltage xtracted from the C-V measurements increased at higher RF power, which suggests the formation of a heavily damaged layer at higher ion energy. It is also found that an Ar plasma introduces more damage than a N 2 plasma as observed by a higher ideality factor and a lower barrier height on the samples tched by Ar sputtering. Addition of C 12, as little as 10 %, results in diode characteristics lose to that of the unetched sample. The damage observed can be classified into major and minor degrees of damage. In this study, most of the samples have only minor damage. Major damage was observed only on samples that were etched at high RF power or with a low concentration f reactive species. Dry etching has become increasingly important in the fabrication of many advanced <b>evices</b> because of the favor...|$|R
