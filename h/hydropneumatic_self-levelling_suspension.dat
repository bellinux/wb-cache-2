5000|$|The Citroën DS (...) is a front-engine, {{front-wheel-drive}} executive car manufactured {{and marketed}} by the French company Citroën from 1955 to 1975 in sedan, wagon/estate and convertible body configurations. Italian sculptor and industrial designer Flaminio Bertoni and the French aeronautical engineer André Lefèbvre styled and engineered the car. Paul Magès developed the <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|E
50|$|In 1954 it had {{produced}} the world's first <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> system then, in 1955, the revolutionary DS, the first mass production car with modern disc brakes and, in 1967, it introduced {{in several of}} its models, swiveling headlights that allowed for greater visibility on winding roads; these automobiles have received various international and national level awards, including three European Car of the Year.|$|E

50|$|A {{significant}} {{addition to}} the 156 range came in 2000 {{with the introduction of}} the Sportwagon Station wagon or estate car, a first attempt at this configuration and size for the company. The Sportwagon was also available with Boge-Nivomat <b>self-levelling</b> <b>hydropneumatic</b> rear <b>suspension.</b> The Sportwagon was marketed as lifestyle estatewithout large carrying capacity. The Sportwagon bodystyle filled a gap in the market that Alfa Romeo had distanced themselves from since the 33 SportWagon of the 1980s.|$|R
5000|$|The CX saloon {{was finally}} {{replaced}} by the XM in May 1989. This vehicle {{was based on the}} same chassis as the Peugeot 605. It was styled in a distinctive, angular fashion, and fitted with <b>self-levelling</b> <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>suspension,</b> and featured new electronic controls and branded Hydractive suspension. It also featured a hatchback and a conventional interior rather than the [...] "spaceship" [...] instrument panel of the CX. The XM was clearly related to the BX in layout and construction, but incorporated little design and technology from the CX. The estate remained in production until July 1991, when an estate version of the XM was finally launched.|$|R
50|$|The angular {{hatchback}} {{was designed}} by Marcello Gandini of Bertone, based on his unused design for the British 1977 Reliant FW11 concept and his 1979 Volvo Tundra concept car. It was the second car {{to benefit from the}} merger of Peugeot and Citroën in 1976, the first being the Citroën Visa launched in 1978. The BX shared its platform with the more conventional 405 that appeared in 1987, except the rear suspension which is from a Peugeot 305 Break. Among the features that set the car apart from the competition was the traditional Citroën <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension,</b> extensive use of plastic body panels (bonnet, tailgate, bumpers), and front and rear disc brakes.|$|E
5000|$|... 1955 saw the {{introduction}} of the DS, the first full usage of Citroën's now legendary <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> system, tested on the rear suspension of the Traction in 1954, which was also the first production car with modern disc brakes.A single high-pressure hydraulic system was used to activate the power steering, the suspension and brakes, the brakes were power assisted to multiply the force applied by the driver.On the [...] "Citromatic" [...] (semi-automatic transmission) version, the system also operated the clutch, through a system of pistons in the gearbox cover to shift the gears in the transmission.From 1968, the DS also introduced directional headlights, that moved with the steering, improving visibility at night.The streamlined car was remarkable for its era and had a remarkable sounding name - in French, DS is pronounced , which sounds the same as , which means Goddess. It placed third in the 1999 Car of the Century competition.|$|E
5000|$|The 6.9 was {{the first}} Mercedes-Benz to be fitted with the <b>hydropneumatic</b> <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> system {{introduced}} by Citroën in 1954, unlike the 600 and 6.3 which employed air suspensions. Using a combination of fluid-filled struts and nitrogen-filled pressure vessels or [...] "accumulators" [...] in lieu of conventional shock absorbers and springs, the system was pressurized by a hydraulic pump driven by the engine's timing chain. Compared to the new Mercedes-Benz system, Citroën's was belt-driven, exactly like a conventional power steering pump; failure of the Citroën system thus might result in loss of suspension. Conversely, every unit of the 6.9 was shipped with hard rubber emergency dampers that served as temporary springs and allowed the car to be driven {{in the event of}} a hydraulic failure. The special hydraulic fluid required by the system was stored in a tank inside the engine compartment. Not only was the system totally self-adjusting, ride height could be altered by a dash-mounted push-pull knob under the speedometer that raised the car an additional two inches (50 mm) for increased ground clearance.|$|E

50|$|The {{suspension}} on 16-valve {{models is}} very different from the standard 190 (W201). As well as being lower and stiffer, it has quicker dampers, larger anti-roll bars, harder bushings and hydraulic <b>Self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> (SLS) on the rear. This allows the rear ride height to remain constant even when the car is fully loaded.|$|R
5000|$|The 'estate ("Safari" [...] in the United Kingdom;Break in France), {{produced}} from 1975 until 1991, was a 10 in longer car.

Included was air conditioning, headlamp washers, a six-speaker sound system, rear <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> (SLS), anti-lock braking system, and inlaid burl walnut wood trim (pre-MY1991).

2500|$|In 1957, Cadillac {{attempted}} to move upmarket, creating the hand-built Series 70 Eldorado Brougham. It featured <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension,</b> [...] "memory seat" [...] function, and an all-transistor signal-seeking car radio that {{was produced by}} GM's Delco Radio and which was available as standard equipment for the 1957 Eldorado Brougham models.

50|$|Automobiles can {{be heavily}} laden with luggage, passengers, and trailers. This loading {{will cause a}} vehicle's tail to sink downwards.

5000|$|In 1954, Frenchman Paul Magès {{developed}} a functioning air/oil hydropneumatic suspension, incorporating {{the advantages of}} earlier air suspension concepts. [...] Citroën replaced the conventional steel springs on the rear axle of their top-of-range model, the Traction Avant 15 Hydraulique. In 1955, the Citroën DS incorporated four wheel hydropneumatic suspension. This combined a very soft, comfortable suspension, with controlled movements, for sharp handling, together with a <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension.</b>|$|R
50|$|The car's most {{innovative}} feature was a high-pressure hydraulic system licensed from Citroën, with dual-circuit braking and hydraulic <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension.</b> At first, both {{the front and}} rear of the car were controlled by the leveling system; the front levelling was deleted in 1969 as it had been determined that the rear levelling did almost all the work. Rolls-Royce achieved a high degree of ride quality with this arrangement.|$|R
50|$|The ABC {{system also}} allows <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension,</b> which raises or lowers the vehicle in {{response}} to changing load (i.e. the loading or unloading of passengers or cargo). Each vehicle equipped with ABC has an “ABC Sport” button that allows the driver to adjust the suspension range for different driving style preferences. This feature allows the driver to adjust the suspension to maintain a more level ride in more demanding driving conditions.|$|R
5000|$|Twenty-six ETR211 [...] "Metrocar" [...] three-car {{articulated}} {{units were}} introduced between November 2008 and September 2009. Manufactured by {{a consortium of}} Firema and AnsaldoBreda, these trains are capable of carrying 450 passengers and are styled by Pininfarina. As well as being {{more powerful than the}} FE220 units, they have computer driving aids, <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension.</b> These units are mostly used to provide the express service whilst the FE220 provide cheaper , stopping services which tend to be far more crowded.|$|R
50|$|A {{small number}} of Discovery II Commercial models were {{produced}} by Land Rover Special Vehicles, this time based on the five-door bodyshell but with the windows rendered opaque to give van-like appearance and security. Normal vehicles were exported to Republic of Ireland, where the rear side windows were smashed and rear seats were destroyed {{in the presence of}} a Revenue official, to offer a model that avoided the Vehicle Registration Tax (saving approximately 40%). The Commercials came with rear <b>self-levelling</b> <b>suspension</b> as standard.|$|R
