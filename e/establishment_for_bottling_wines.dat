50|$|The process <b>for</b> <b>bottling</b> <b>wine</b> {{is largely}} {{similar to that}} <b>for</b> <b>bottling</b> beer, except <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> differ in volumes and shapes. Traditionally, a cork is used to provide closure to <b>wine</b> <b>bottles.</b> After filling, a bottle travels to a corking machine (corker) where a cork is {{compressed}} and pushed into {{the neck of the}} bottle. Whilst this is happening, the corker vacuums the air out of the bottle to form a negative pressure headspace. This removes any oxygen from the headspace, which is useful as latent oxygen can ruin the quality of the product via oxidation. A negative pressure headspace will also counteract pressure caused by the thermal expansion of the wine, preventing the cork from being forced from the bottle. Champagnes and sparkling wines may further be sealed with a muselet, which ensures the cork will not explode off in transit. Alternative wine closures such as screw caps are available.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis study {{analyses}} the intra-EU {{trade of}} the world׳s chief wine exporters, namely Italy, France and Spain. Using an augmented {{version of the}} gravity model we empirically assess which of the three countries have experienced growth in intra-EU market trade. Effects of transportation costs, as well as demand and supply gaps between origin and destination countries, {{on the size of}} bilateral trade flows were specifically taken into account. Estimation results highlight the differences between bulk and <b>bottled</b> <b>wine,</b> providing useful information for European producers and policy-makers involved on regulation of wine sector. As concern bulk wine, Italy and Spain show no element of growth in competitiveness, while France shows a statistically significant annual decrease. In contrast, estimates <b>for</b> <b>bottled</b> <b>wine</b> all show a growth tendency, albeit with a different magnitude of coefficients. Italy is the country with the highest trend, followed by Spain and France which instead has a decidedly modest growth in export values. However, analysis of pricing policies shows that France does not appear to target an increase in export volumes so much as an increase in average unit price, while Italy, and especially Spain, have a tendency to increase export volumes, also to the detriment of prices...|$|R

40|$|Issue: A {{successful}} {{program for}} re-washing recycled glass containers {{for use in}} applications such as <b>wine</b> <b>bottling</b> depends on overcoming a number of challenges, including developing collection infrastructure, sorting diverse bottle streams, achieving efficient washing, and market penetration. Bottle washing programs may focus {{on a variety of}} bottle types, including beer <b>bottles,</b> <b>wine</b> <b>bottles,</b> or juice bottles. This Best Practice focuses on the key elements of a wine bottle-washing program, although many of the concepts are applicable to other containers. A successful bottle-washing program requires the integration of collection and supply infrastructure, sorting protocols, and equipment selection. Best Practice: Historically, bottles were manufactured to heavy specifications as returnables. Today, most glass containers are manufactured as one-way containers, not intended to withstand the rigors of multiple re-washings. <b>Wine</b> <b>bottles</b> remain an exception. <b>Wine</b> <b>bottles</b> manufactured in the United States generally have the same weight as those manufactured in Europe, where washing <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> is a common procedure. Because it contains a non-pressurized liquid, a <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> does not have the same potential to break from pressure, as does a defective container of beer or soda. However, the development of coated glass bottles may lead to lighter weight <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> as well. In addition, only regions with an adequate wine production industry are potential locations <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> washing facilities. Finally, <b>wine</b> <b>bottles</b> wholesale <b>for</b> 35 ¢- 40 ¢each, while beer bottles cost only about 10 ¢, so washing may be more economically feasible <b>for</b> <b>wine</b> <b>bottles.</b> The collection of bottles must be structured to maximize the recovery of usable containers.

40|$|Two {{experiments}} {{were conducted in}} a virtual reality (VR) environment in order to investigate participants’ in-store visual search <b>for</b> <b>bottles</b> of <b>wines</b> displaying a prominent triangular shape on their label. The experimental task involved virtually moving along a wine aisle in a virtual supermarket while searching <b>for</b> the <b>wine</b> <b>bottle</b> on the shelf that had a different triangle on its label from the other bottles. The results of Experiment 1 revealed that the participants identified the bottle with a downward-pointing triangle on its label more rapidly than when looking for an upward-pointing triangle on the label instead. This finding replicates the downward-pointing triangle superiority (DPTS) effect, though {{the magnitude of this}} effect was more pronounced in the first as compared to {{the second half of the}} experiment, suggesting a modulating role of practice. The results of Experiment 2 revealed that the DPTS effect was also modulated by the location of the target on the shelf. Interestingly, however, the results of a follow-up survey demonstrate that the orientation of the triangle did not influence the participants’ evaluation of the <b>wine</b> <b>bottles.</b> Taken together, these findings reveal how in-store the attention of consumers might be influenced by the design elements in product packaging. These results therefore suggest that shopping in a virtual supermarket might offer a practical means of assessing the shelf standout of product packaging, which has important implications for food marketing...|$|R
