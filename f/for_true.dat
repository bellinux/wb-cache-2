5|$|One day Narendra {{requested}} Ramakrishna to pray to goddess Kali {{for their}} family's financial welfare. Ramakrishna suggested {{him to go}} to the temple himself and pray. Following Ramakrishna's suggestion, he went to the temple thrice, but failed to pray for any kind of worldly necessities and ultimately prayed <b>for</b> <b>true</b> knowledge and devotion from the goddess. Narendra gradually grew ready to renounce everything for the sake of realising God, and accepted Ramakrishna as his Guru.|$|E

5|$|The American artist Miriam C. Rice pioneered {{research}} into using various mushrooms for natural dyes. Starting {{in the late}} 1960s, she discovered mushroom dyes for a complete rainbow palette. Swedish and American mycologists, building upon Rice's research, have discovered sources <b>for</b> <b>true</b> blues (Sarcodon squamosus) and mossy greens (Hydnellum geogenium). Hypholoma fasciculare provides a yellow dye, and fungi such as Phaeolus schweinitzii and Pisolithus tinctorius are used in dyeing textiles and paper.|$|E

5000|$|Sophists are {{considered}} the founding fathers of relativism in the Western World. Elements of relativism emerged among the Sophists in the 5th century BC. Notably, it was Protagoras who coined the phrase, [...] "Man is the measure of all things: of things which are, that they are, and of things which are not, that they are not." [...] The thinking of the Sophists is mainly known through their opponents, Plato and Socrates. In a well known paraphrased dialogue with Socrates, Protagoras said: [...] "What is <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you is <b>true</b> <b>for</b> you, and what is <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me is <b>true</b> <b>for</b> me." ...|$|R
50|$|In model theory, a {{transfer}} principle states that all statements of some language that are <b>true</b> <b>for</b> some structure are <b>true</b> <b>for</b> another structure. One {{of the first}} examples was the Lefschetz principle, which states that any sentence in the first-order language of fields <b>true</b> <b>for</b> the complex numbers is also <b>true</b> <b>for</b> any algebraically closed field of characteristic 0.|$|R
5|$|Many fungi {{can serve}} as source of food for insect larvae, whereas most insects eat fungi only occasionally. Still, {{a whole range of}} insect species {{specialize}} on fungi. These animals are mainly beetle larvae, especially hairy fungus beetles (Mycetophagidae), rove beetles (Staphylinidae), and true flies (Diptera). Milk caps are especially attractive <b>for</b> <b>true</b> flies, while beetle larvae are comparatively rarer. The most common insects found on the fungus are Mycetophilidae and Phoridae larvae, which populate even the youngest fruit bodies. Also relatively common on mature or overaged fruit bodies are Drosophilidae and Psychodidae. Species from the section Deliciosi are often infested by Diptera larvae.|$|E
5|$|Feathers {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{recognizable}} characteristics of modern birds, and a trait that was shared by all other dinosaur groups. Based on the current distribution of fossil evidence, it appears that feathers were an ancestral dinosaurian trait, though one that may have been selectively lost in some species. Direct fossil evidence of feathers or feather-like structures has been discovered in a diverse array of species in many non-avian dinosaur groups, both among saurischians and ornithischians. Simple, branched, feather-like structures are known from heterodontosaurids, primitive neornithischians and theropods, and primitive ceratopsians. Evidence <b>for</b> <b>true,</b> vaned feathers similar to the flight feathers of modern birds has been found only in the theropod subgroup Maniraptora, which includes oviraptorosaurs, troodontids, dromaeosaurids, and birds. Feather-like structures known as pycnofibres have also been found in pterosaurs, suggesting the possibility that feather-like filaments may have been common in the bird lineage and evolved before the appearance of dinosaurs themselves. Research into the genetics of American alligators has also revealed that crocodylian scutes do possess feather-keratins during embryonic development, but these keratins are not expressed by the animals before hatching.|$|E
5|$|Intended to be Galveston follow-up, Pizzolatto felt True Detective {{was more}} {{suitable}} on-screen once the project took definite form. Pizzolatto shopped the novel to two TV executives, and, once he secured {{a deal in}} May 2010, drafted six screenplays, including the pilot episode script <b>for</b> <b>True</b> Detective, which ran 90 pages. He devoted another script for the series shortly after his departure from The Killings writing staff in 2011, thanks to the support of Anonymous Content. The final copy, amounting to 500 pages, was written {{without the aid of}} a writing staff. By this time, Pizzolatto secured a development deal with HBO, and by April 2012, the network commissioned True Detective on an order of eight episodes. Set up as an anthology series, each season will feature a different cast of characters and self-contained narratives in various time periods and locations.|$|E
5000|$|The {{theory of}} PA cannot define the {{standard}} {{part of a}} nonstandard model. This is because the standard part of a nonstandard model is closed under the successor operation, so a first-order formula that were <b>true</b> <b>for</b> exactly the standard numbers would satisfy the premises of the induction schema (<b>true</b> <b>for</b> 0 and <b>true</b> <b>for</b> every successor of an element it is <b>true</b> <b>for)</b> without satisfying the conclusion (true everywhere). This is {{the origin of the}} overspill principle: if some formula is <b>true</b> <b>for</b> all the standard elements of the model it must be <b>true</b> <b>for</b> a nonstandard element as well. Any infinite part of the model defined by a first-order formula must [...] "spill over" [...] from the standard part into the nonstandard part; otherwise the formula would define the standard part of the model.|$|R
