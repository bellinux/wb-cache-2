500|$|Although {{plans for}} the statue had not been finalized, Bartholdi moved forward with {{fabrication}} of the right arm, bearing the torch, and the <b>head.</b> <b>Work</b> began at the Gaget, Gauthier & Co. workshop. In May 1876, Bartholdi traveled to the United States {{as a member of}} a French delegation to the Centennial Exhibition, and arranged for a huge painting of the statue to be shown in New York as part of the Centennial festivities. The arm did not arrive in Philadelphia until August; because of its late arrival, it was not listed in the exhibition catalogue, and while some reports correctly identified the work, others called it the [...] "Colossal Arm" [...] or [...] "Bartholdi Electric Light". The exhibition grounds contained a number of monumental artworks to compete for fairgoers' interest, including an outsized fountain designed by Bartholdi. Nevertheless, the arm proved popular in the exhibition's waning days, and visitors would climb up to the balcony of the torch to view the fairgrounds. After the exhibition closed, the arm was transported to New York, where it remained on display in Madison Square Park for several years before it was returned to France to join the rest of the statue.|$|E
2500|$|He {{sufficiently}} impressed in British Guiana to {{be selected}} for the 1900 tour to England {{even though he had}} not played a single important match. He was described before the tour as [...] "Probably the best bowler in the West Indies, using his head to great advantage. Hard hitting, run-getting bat". On the tour he was second in the bowling averages marginally behind Float Woods and leading wicket taker with 78. He had one good innings of 64* against the Gentlemen of the M.C.C. but otherwise his batting was disappointing. Compared to Woods he was [...] "generally thought in England to be the better bowler of the two. His length was always excellent, and he possessed more finesse and <b>head</b> <b>work</b> than the Trinidad bowler. He sent down a good yorker, and it was with this ball that he twice had the honour of bowling W.G. Though Woods headed him by the merest fraction in the bowling analyses, it was pretty generally admitted that Burton on the whole accomplished the best work".|$|E

60|$|He {{was missing}} no signs, no indications, no probabilities, no possibilities. But {{he was in}} doubt. Like a hawk he was {{watching}} the Rube, and, as well, the crafty batters. The inning might not tell the truth as to the Rube's luck, though it would test his control. The Rube's speed and curves, without any <b>head</b> <b>work,</b> would have made him a pitcher of no mean ability, but was this remarkable placing of balls just accident? That was the question.|$|E
60|$|Every pitch lessened the Rube's {{strength}} and these wise opponents knew it. Likewise the Rube himself knew, {{and never had}} he shown better <b>head</b> <b>work</b> than in this inning. If he were to win, he must be quick. So he wasted not a ball. The first pitch and the second, delivered breast high and fairly over the plate, beautiful balls to hit, Shultz watched speed by. He swung hard on the third and the crippled Ashwell dove for it {{in a cloud of}} dust, got a hand in front of it, but uselessly, for the hit was safe. The crowd cheered that splendid effort.|$|E

"Their fathers cannot {{generally}} {{give them}} {{enough to support}} them," [...] said Jonas, [...] "even if they are disposed to do it; because, you see, {{they have their own}} families still to support. Besides, if they were to divide their property at once among all their children, it would only be a small portion for each one. It wouldn't be enough for the boys to live as expensively as they have been living while at home.

Well, my good working friends, these questions will take a little time to answer yet. They must be answered: all good men are occupied with them, and all honest thinkers. There's grand <b>head</b> <b>work</b> doing about them; but much must be discovered, and much attempted in vain, before anything decisive can be told you.

So, {{when he saw}} that conversation was irksome to his master, he held his peace and meditated upon what he called his [...] "day-thought." [...] It was his practice to choose every morning some tough food for reflection, and to chew the cud of it in his mind at times when, without such employment, his wits would have gone wool-gathering. You may imagine, Raja Vikram, that with a few years of this <b>head</b> <b>work,</b> the minister's son became a very crafty young person.|$|E

6000|$|In {{philosophy}} {{she was a}} Platonist, {{in politics}} an Opportunist. She attached herself to no particular party. She loved the people when they were king-like, and kings when they showed themselves to be men. Of the real value and motive of poetry she had a most exalted idea. ‘Poetry,’ she says, in the preface {{of one of her}} volumes, ‘has been as serious a thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing. There has been no playing at skittles for me in either. I never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry, nor leisure for the hour of the poet. I have done my work so far, not as mere hand and <b>head</b> <b>work</b> apart from the personal being, but as the completest expression of that being to which I could attain.’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Since my [...] "Seraphim" [...] was {{received}} by the public with more kindness than its writer had counted on, I dare not rely on having put away the faults with which that volume abounded and was mildly reproached. Something indeed I may hope to have retrieved, because some progress in mind and in art every active thinker and honest writer must consciously or unconsciously make, with the progress of existence and experience: and, in some sort--since [...] "we learn in suffering what we teach in song,"--my songs may be fitter to teach. But {{if it were not}} presumptuous language on the lips of one to whom life is more than usually uncertain, my favourite wish for this work would be, that it be {{received by the}} public as {{a step in the right}} track, towards a future indication of more value and acceptability. I would fain do better,--and I feel as if I might do better: I aspire to do better. It is no new form of the nympholepsy of poetry, that my ideal should fly before me:--and if I cry out too hopefully at sight of the white vesture receding between the cypresses, let me be blamed gently if justly. In any case, while my poems are full of faults,--as I go forward to my critics and confess,--they have my heart and life in them,--they are not empty shells. If it must be said of me that I have contributed immemorable verses to the many rejected by the age, it cannot at least be said that I have done so in a light and irresponsible spirit. Poetry has been as serious a thing to me as life itself; and life has been a very serious thing: there has been no playing at skittles for me in either. I never mistook pleasure for the final cause of poetry; nor leisure, for the hour of the poet. I have done my work, so far, as work,--not as mere hand and <b>head</b> <b>work,</b> apart from the personal being,--but as the completest expression of that being to which I could attain,--and as work I offer it to the public,--feeling its shortcomings more deeply than any of my readers, because measured from the height of my aspiration,--but feeling also that the reverence and sincerity with which the work was done should give it some protection with the reverent and sincere.|$|E
60|$|Supposing, then, {{we have it}} {{determined}} {{with appropriate}} justice, who is to do the hand work, the next questions must be how the hand-workers are to be paid, {{and how they are}} to be refreshed, and what play they are to have. Now, the possible quantity of play depends on the possible quantity of pay; and the quantity of pay is not a matter for consideration to hand-workers only, but to all workers. Generally, good, useful work, whether of the hand or head, is either ill-paid, or not paid at all. I don't say it should be so, but it always is so. People, as a rule, only pay for being amused or being cheated, not for being served. Five thousand a year to your talker, and a shilling a day to your fighter, digger, and thinker, is the rule. None of the best <b>head</b> <b>work</b> in art, literature, or science, is ever paid for. How much do you think Homer got for his Iliad? or Dante for his Paradise? only bitter bread and salt, and going up and down other people's stairs. In science, the man who discovered the telescope, and first saw heaven, was paid with a dungeon; the man who invented the microscope, and first saw earth, died of starvation, driven from his home: it is indeed very clear that God means all thoroughly good work and talk to be done for nothing. Baruch, the scribe, did not get a penny a line for writing Jeremiah's second roll for him, I fancy; and St. Stephen did not get bishop's pay for that long sermon of his to the Pharisees; nothing but stones. For indeed that is the world-father's proper payment. So surely as any of the world's children work for the world's good, honestly, with head and heart; and come to it, saying, 'Give us a little bread, just to keep the life in us,' the world-father answers them, 'No, my children, not bread; a stone, if you like, or as many as you need, to keep you quiet.' But the hand-workers are not so ill off as all this comes to. The worst that can happen to you is to break stones; not be broken by them. And for you there will come a time for better payment; some day, assuredly, more pence will be paid to Peter the Fisherman, and fewer to Peter the Pope; we shall pay people not quite so much for talking in Parliament and doing nothing, as for holding their tongues out of it and doing something; we shall pay our ploughman a little more and our lawyer a little less, and so on: but, at least, we may even now take care that whatever work is done shall be fully paid for; and the man who does it paid for it, not somebody else; and that it shall be done in an orderly, soldierly, well-guided, wholesome way, under good captains and lieutenants of labour; and that it shall have its appointed times of rest, and enough of them; and that in those times the play shall be wholesome play, not in theatrical gardens, with tin flowers and gas sunshine, and girls dancing because of their misery; but in true gardens, with real flowers, and real sunshine, and children dancing because of their gladness; so that truly the streets shall be full (the 'streets,' mind you, not the gutters) of children, playing in the midst thereof. We may take care that working-men shall have at least as good books to read as anybody else, when they've time to read them; and as comfortable fire-sides to sit at as anybody else, when they've time to sit at them. This, I think, can be managed for you, my working friends, in the good time.|$|E
