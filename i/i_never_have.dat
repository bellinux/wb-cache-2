Both were named finalists for the Norris Trophy, but lost to Detroit's Nicklas Lidström. Individually, Niedermayer played his 1,000th career game, against the Edmonton Oilers on November 28, 2006. He set career highs of 15 goals, 54 assists and 69 points {{during the regular}} season and was named a First Team All-Star. He added 11 points in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs, and was named recipient of the Conn Smythe Memorial Trophy as the most valuable player of the post-season after leading Anaheim to the franchise's first championship in a five-game series victory over the Ottawa Senators in the final. As team captain, Niedermayer was the first player given the chance to hoist the Stanley Cup. He passed the trophy to his brother; it was Rob's first championship victory. Of the moment, Scott stated: [...] "You don't really dream of passing it to your brother. <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have.</b> To {{be able to do that}} is definitely a highlight of my career." ...|$|E

500|$|Following {{the first}} {{minutes of the}} drama, {{reactions}} on Twitter were mixed. Nicole Golden from TV Fanatic gave the episode 4.5 stars out of 5.0. She found that [...] "overall, the concept worked since music really has always played {{a big part in}} the show. Some songs were more appropriate and/or better performed than others, though." [...] She also wrote the concept worked in part because it was new but noted [...] "the format would probably not have the same effect if used in future episodes." [...] Even though Boston Heralds critic Mark Perigard was not a fan of the concept, saying [...] "the Grey's Anatomy event proved how tricky it is for an established show, especially a drama, to pull off a musical episode," [...] he did like several actors's performances. He wrote: [...] "Chandra Wilson and Chyler Leigh (whom <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>have</b> anything good to say about) delivered some impressive vocal work. Eric Dane did some of his best acting of his career last night as an anxious father-to-be terrified he would lose his best friend." [...] Lyneka Little of The Wall Street Journal wrote, [...] "If Glee and ER had a baby it would be tonight’s episode of the medical drama Grey’s Anatomy titled “Song Beneath the Song.”" [...] In his review of the episode Alan Sepinwall of HitFix wrote [...] "Like Grey's Anatomy as a whole, some parts were unintentionally silly, others were surprisingly powerful, and it was rarely dull, at least." ...|$|E

2500|$|It {{was during}} his naval stint in Honolulu that Granger {{had his first}} sexual experiences, one with a hostess at a private club {{and the other with}} a Navy officer visiting the same venue, both on the same night.

2500|$|All That You Can't Leave Behind {{received}} favorable {{reviews from}} critics; at Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 79, based on 17 reviews. Many critics, such as Rolling Stone magazine, declared it as [...] "U2's third masterpiece", alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby. Steve Morse of The Boston Globe said the record [...] "has great songs that tie together beautifully—a welcome {{change from the}} disjointed nature of U2 discs such as 1993's Zooropa and 1997's Pop". He believed that Bono took extra care in crafting the lyrics, resulting in the [...] "most thoughtful, personal, and tender U2 songs in memory". In his review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau felt that the album eschewed the artsier tendencies of U2's previous work in favor of hooky pop songs and stated, [...] "The feat's offhandedness is its most salient charm and nagging limitation.

2500|$|Madonna instead used {{social media}} to promote MDNA, like posting minute-long snippets of several album tracks, behind-the-scenes {{pictures}} of tour rehearsals, and online polls asking her fans regarding set list {{choice for the}} tour. On March 24 she participated in a livestream chat on Facebook, which was hosted by Jimmy Fallon. In order to boost up the album streams, Madonna partnered with Spotify, and launched an opportunity for its listeners to win two tickets for The MDNA Tour. For eligibility, users had to stream the album in full thrice on Spotify, within two weeks since release. She later made a brief appearance on Ultra Music Festival in Miami a few days later, where she introduced Swedish DJ Avicii. During her appearance he played his own remix of [...] "Girl Gone Wild". At one point the singer asked the audience, [...] "How {{many people in this}} crowd have seen Molly?" [...] It was met with negative reception, with producer Deadmau5 condemning her use of the word molly, which is a slang for MDMA. Madonna responded on Twitter by posting a 1989 picture of herself, wearing Minnie Mouse ears, and a comment: [...] "From one mouse to another.
