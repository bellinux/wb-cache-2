500|$|The track {{included}} the highly compressed drums that the Beatles currently favoured, with reverse cymbals, reverse guitar, processed vocals, looped tape effects, a sitar and a tambura drone. The {{use of these}} ¼-inch audio tape loops resulted primarily from McCartney's admiration for Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge. By disabling the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The tape could also be induced to go faster and slower. McCartney encouraged the other Beatles {{to use the same}} effects and create their own loops. After experimentation on their own, the various Beatles supplied a total of [...] "30 or so" [...] tape loops to Martin, who selected 16 for use on the song. Each loop was about six seconds long.|$|E
2500|$|... "Tomorrow Never Knows" [...] is {{the final}} track of The Beatles' 1966 studio album Revolver; {{credited}} as a Lennon–McCartney song, it was written primarily by John Lennon with major contributions to the arrangement by Paul McCartney. The track included looped tape effects. For the track, McCartney supplied a bag of -inch audio tape loops he had made at home after listening to Stockhausen's Gesang der Jünglinge. By disabling the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> of a tape recorder and then spooling a continuous loop of tape through the machine while recording, the tape would constantly overdub itself, creating a saturation effect, a technique also used in musique concrète. The Beatles would continue these efforts with [...] "Revolution 9", a track produced in 1968 for The White Album. It made sole use of sound collage, credited to Lennon–McCartney, but created primarily by John Lennon with assistance from George Harrison and Yoko Ono.|$|E
2500|$|Many delay {{processors}} {{based on}} analog tape recording, such as Ray Butts' EchoSonic (1952), Mike Battle's Echoplex (1959), or the Roland Space Echo (1973), used magnetic tape as their {{recording and playback}} medium. Electric motors guided a tape loop through a device {{with a variety of}} mechanisms allowing modification of the effect's parameters. In the case of the popular Echoplex EP-2, the [...] play head was fixed, while a combination record and <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> was mounted on a slide, thus the delay time of the echo was adjusted by changing the distance between the record and play heads. In the Space Echo, all of the heads are fixed, but the speed of the tape could be adjusted, changing the delay time. Thin magnetic tape was not entirely suited for continuous operation, however, so the tape loop had to be replaced {{from time to time to}} maintain the audio fidelity of the processed sounds.|$|E
50|$|Normally, {{the tape}} is passed {{longitudinally}} through two fixed <b>erase</b> <b>heads,</b> one located just before the tape moves to the video head drum and the other {{right next to the}} audio/control head stack. Upon recording, the <b>erase</b> <b>heads</b> <b>erase</b> any old recording contained on the tape to prevent anything already recorded on it from interfering with what is being recorded.|$|R
50|$|Erasing {{the data}} tracks without {{destroying}} the servo tracks requires special equipment. The <b>erasing</b> <b>head</b> {{used in these}} erasers has four magnetic poles that match the width {{and the location of}} the data bands.|$|R
50|$|The term erased is {{most often}} used of an animal's head, when the neck is {{depicted}} with a ragged edge as if forcibly torn from the body. <b>Erased</b> <b>heads</b> are distinct from those couped, in that the former are cut off along a jagged line while the latter are cut off along a straight line.|$|R
50|$|The flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is {{so-called}} {{because an}} <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> {{is mounted on}} the video head drum and rotates around {{in the same manner}} as the video heads. In the record mode, the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is active and erases the video precisely down to the recorded video fields. The flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> runs over the tape and the video heads record the signal virtually instantly after the flying <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> has passed.|$|E
50|$|An <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is {{constructed}} {{in a similar}} manner to a record or replay head, but has a much larger gap, or more frequently, two large gaps. The <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is powered during recording from a high frequency source (usually the same oscillator that provides the AC bias). In some inexpensive cassette recorder designs, the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is a permanent magnet that is mechanically moved into contact with the moving tape only during recording. Permanent magnet erase heads are also sometimes used in machines that are equipped with DC bias.|$|E
50|$|However, {{when trying}} to edit footage deck to deck, {{portions}} of the old recording's video may be between the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> and video recording heads. This results in a faint rainbow-like noise at and briefly after {{the point of the}} cut as the old video recording missed by the fixed <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is never completely erased as the new recording is printed.|$|E

50|$|The <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> is fed {{by a high}} level, high {{frequency}} AC signal that overwrites any previous recording on the tape. Without this step, the new recording cannot be guaranteed to completely replace any old recording {{that might have been}} on the tape.|$|E

5000|$|Use of {{separate}} heads for recording vs. playback (three heads total, counting the <b>erase</b> <b>head)</b> enabled {{monitoring of the}} recorded signal {{a fraction of a}} second after recording. Mixing the playback signal back into the record input also created a primitive echo generator.|$|E
5000|$|In later years, an [...] "auto reverse" [...] feature {{appeared}} {{that allowed the}} deck to play (and, in some decks, record) {{on both sides of}} the cassette without the operator having to manually remove, flip, and re-insert the cassette. Most auto-reverse machines use a four channel head (similar to those on multitrack recorders), with only two channels connected to the electronics at one time, one pair for each direction. Auto-reverse decks employ a capstan and pinch roller for each side. Since these use the same opening in the cassette shell normally used for the <b>erase</b> <b>head,</b> such decks must fit the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> (or two, one for each direction) into the center opening in the shell along with the record/play head.|$|E
50|$|Multi-track {{recording}} {{differs from}} overdubbing and sound on sound because it records separate signals to individual tracks. Sound on sound which Les Paul invented adds a new performance to an existing recording {{by placing a}} second playback head {{in front of the}} <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> to play back the existing track before erasing it and re-recording a new track.|$|E

50|$|Superimposition (SI) during sound {{recording}} and reproduction (commonly called overdubbing) {{is the process}} of adding new sounds over existing without completely erasing or masking the existing sound. Some reel-to-reel tape recorders of the mid 20th century provided crude superimposition facilities that were implemented by killing the high-frequency AC feed to the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> while recording as normal via the read-write head.|$|E
50|$|Since the <b>erase</b> <b>head</b> erases the old signal {{right before}} the video heads write onto the tape, there is no remnant of the old signal to cause visible {{distortion}} at and after the moment a cut is made, resulting in a clean edit. In addition, the ability of flying erase heads to erase old video off the tape right before recording new video on it allows the ability to perform insert editing, where new footage can be placed within an existing recording with clean cuts {{at the beginning and}} end of the edit.|$|E

[...] Beginning in the late 1950s the BBC Radiophonic Workshop began using tape loops to add special effects to some BBC programming. [...] Several different configurations of tape loops were employed {{in the early years}} of the WDR Studio in Cologne.

50|$|Sel-sync {{along with}} the {{multi-track}} head was invented by Ross Snyder at Ampex in 1955. Three problems had to be solved: mechanical alignment, switching of the record track to playback mode and multitrack <b>erase</b> <b>head.</b> The hard problem was the switching of a track between record and playback mode, as the impedance of record heads are {{quite different from the}} impedance of play back heads. Prior to Sel-Sync record heads were directly wired to the record electronics and playback heads were directly wired to the playback electronics. Also the designs of the two heads were very different. The problem of switching very low-level/high-impedance circuitry without introducing hum or noise had to be solved. Mort Fujii in the Ampex special projects lab was responsible for the actual design.|$|E
