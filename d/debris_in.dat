5|$|Like most of {{the species}} of the order Phallales, Clathrus ruber is saprobic—a {{decomposer}} of wood and plant organic matter—and is commonly found fruiting in mulch beds. The fungus grows alone or clustered together near woody <b>debris,</b> <b>in</b> lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil.|$|E
5|$|Our {{understanding}} of herbivory in geological time comes from three sources: fossilized plants, which may preserve evidence of defense (such as spines), or herbivory-related damage; {{the observation of}} plant <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> fossilised animal faeces; {{and the construction of}} herbivore mouthparts.|$|E
50|$|By December 2011, {{many pieces}} of <b>debris</b> were <b>in</b> a steady orbital decay towards Earth, and {{expected}} to burn up in the atmosphere within one or two years. By January 2014, 24% of the known <b>debris</b> had decayed. <b>In</b> 2016, Space News listed the collision as the fourth biggest fragmentation event in history, with Iridium 33 producing 628 pieces of cataloged debris, of which 364 pieces of tracked <b>debris</b> remain <b>in</b> orbit as of January 2016.|$|R

5|$|Comet Shoemaker–Levy9 (formally {{designated}} D/1993F2) was a comet {{that broke}} apart in July 1992 and collided with Jupiter in July 1994, providing the first direct observation of an extraterrestrial collision of Solar System objects. This generated {{a large amount}} of coverage in the popular media, and the comet was closely observed by astronomers worldwide. The collision provided new information about Jupiter and highlighted its possible role in reducing space <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> the inner Solar System.|$|E
5|$|Following the storm, 2,100police and firemen dug furiously through mud and <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> {{search of}} the missing. The name Bess was {{previously}} retired in 1974 and replaced with Bonnie. However, when the list of typhoon names was changed to incorporate male names in 1979, the name was re-introduced to the roster. After this usage of the name Bess, it was retired {{for the second time}} and was replaced with Brenda. This marked the only occasion where a single name was removed twice in the same basin.|$|E
40|$|The {{rate that}} earth-orbiting debris {{is removed from}} the {{environment}} is dependent on a number of factors which include orbital altitude and solar activity. It is generally believed that at lower altitudes and especially during periods of high solar activity, <b>debris</b> generated <b>in</b> the past will be eliminated from the environment. While some debris is eliminated, most is replaced by old debris from higher altitudes or new debris from recent launches. Some low altitude debris, which would reenter if the <b>debris</b> were <b>in</b> circular orbits, does not reenter because the <b>debris</b> is <b>in</b> higher-energy elliptical orbits...|$|R

5|$|The Chronister dig site {{is located}} atop the Ripley Formation. The land around the Chronister home and dig site sits atop {{sandstone}} from the Lower Ordovician Period or Canadian Epoch. It {{is located in}} a section of the Ozarks affected by erosion and filled with chert and sandstone <b>debris.</b> <b>In</b> addition, the region has been impacted by frequent faulting, leading to the combination of rocks from different geologic periods. As a result, it is difficult to create an accurate geologic map of the area.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} Mycena vitilis are found growing {{scattered}} or in groups on <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> hardwood or mixed conifer and hardwood forests. Along the Pacific Coast {{it is sometimes}} abundant in Red alder slashes. In eastern North America it is quite commonly found growing in the autumn months of October and November with M.semivestipes and M.pullata. The fungus is widely distributed in Europe (for example, Britain, Germany, Italy, Norway, Poland, Portugal).|$|E
5|$|Utricularia purpurea, a bladderwort, {{comes from}} another genus of {{carnivorous}} plants {{and may have}} lost its appetite for carnivory, at least in part. This species can still trap and digest arthropod prey in its specialized bladder traps, but does so sparingly. Instead, it harbors a community of algae, zooplankton, and <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> the bladders, giving rise to {{the hypothesis that the}} bladders of U. purpurea favor a mutualistic interaction in place of a predator-prey relationship.|$|E

5|$|Collybia cookei is {{most likely}} to be {{confused}} with the two other members of Collybia, both of which are outwardly similar in appearance; distinguishing between the three typically requires excavating the stem base away from the moss or <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> which the stem is embedded. In the field, C.tuberosa may be distinguished from C.cookei by its dark brown sclerotia that somewhat resembles an appleseed. Using a microscope provides a more definitive way of distinguishing the two: the hyphae in the sclerotia of C.cookei are rounded, while those of C.tuberosa are elongated; this diagnostic character is apparent with both fresh and dried material of the two species. C.cirrhata does not produce sclerotia.|$|E
5|$|Dr. Ryan Stone (Bullock), a {{biomedical}} engineer from Lake Zurich, Illinois, is {{aboard the}} NASA Space Shuttle Explorer {{for her first}} space mission, STS-157.

During a spacewalk to service the Hubble Space Telescope, Mission Control in Houston warns the team about a Russian missile strike on a defunct satellite, which has inadvertently caused a chain reaction forming a cloud of <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> space. Mission Control orders that the mission be aborted and the crew begin re-entry immediately because the debris is speeding towards the Shuttle. Communication with Mission Control is lost shortly thereafter.|$|E
5|$|In Tokelau, many of {{the local}} {{officials}} feared about contamination since the cyclone had scattered human waste, trash, and other <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> the ocean and across the island. There was also an increase of mosquitoes and other insects, increasing {{the threat of a}} dengue fever outbreak. In addition, the storm damaged {{many of the}} hospitals, making treatment of the injured or displaced difficult. Criticism of government preparedness followed after Percy as emergency plans were not easily understood by the local population. In Nukunonu, the school, which was destroyed by Percy, was poorly built and vulnerable, and there was no early warning system. Also, many of the population had little time to prepare for the storm because of a social event held hours earlier.|$|E

40|$|Typhoon Mindulle was {{the most}} severe typhoon across the Tachia River {{watershed}} following the 921 Chi-Chi earthquake, and resulted in extremely high precipitation of 1431 mm that induced many landslides, debris flows, and <b>debris</b> floods <b>in</b> affected areas. This paper analyzes the <b>debris</b> flows <b>in</b> the Songhe area induced by Typhoon Mindulle by employing a numerical model for debris flow simulation. The FLO- 2 D numerical program was adopted to simulate the flow conditions of <b>debris</b> flows <b>in</b> the Songhe area, including flow depths, flow velocities, and sediment depositions.

5|$|Like all Phallaceae species, C.columnatus is saprobic, {{and uses}} {{extracellular}} digestion to acquire nutrients from dead and decaying organic matter, like wood. As {{a consequence of}} its predilection for dead wood, the fungus {{is often associated with}} disturbed habitats. It can often be found growing in and around gardens and residences where areas of cultivation or landscaping have resulted in accumulations of mulch, wood chips or other cellulose-rich materials. The mycelial cords can be traced to buried roots, stumps, and other woody material. The species grows in sandy soil, near woody <b>debris,</b> <b>in</b> lawns, gardens, and cultivated soil. Fruit bodies appear singly, or scattered, and can arise in the summer, autumn, and early winter, especially after wet weather.|$|E
5|$|Like other theridiid spiders, the web is a disorganised, {{irregular}} {{tangle of}} fine textured silk. It is hammock-shaped and {{is made up}} of opaque yellowish-white silk. The web consists of a broad base with many supporting threads above and below, including a number of sticky guy lines anchored to <b>debris</b> <b>in</b> the sand. A cone-shaped retreat is built in {{the lower part of the}} web, although the katipo can normally be found near the main body of the web. The plants it builds its web in provide support and shelter for the nest.|$|E
5|$|Most earwigs are nocturnal and inhabit small crevices, {{living in}} small amounts of <b>debris,</b> <b>in</b> various forms such as bark and fallen logs. Species {{have been found to}} be blind and living in caves, or cavernicolous; {{reported}} to be found on the island of Hawaii and in South Africa. Food typically consist of a wide array of living and dead plant and animal matter. For protection from predators, the species Doru taeniatum of earwigs can squirt foul-smelling yellow liquid in the form of jets from scent glands on the dorsal side of the third and fourth abdominal segment. It aims the discharges by revolving the abdomen, a maneuver that enables it simultaneously to use its pincers in defense.|$|E
