40|$|Periodically {{appearing}} amorphous aggregates, 'marine snow', {{are formed}} in the sea and if settled as mats on the sea bottom cause death of benthic metazoans. Especially those animals are killed which are sessile filter feeders, e. g. sponges, mussels, or Anthozoa. The etiology of the toxic principle(s) is not yet well understood. Gel-like marine snow aggregates occurred in the Northern Adriatic during summer 1997. Samples of these aggregates were collected during the period July to September and the outer {{as well as the}} inner zones were analyzed for (i) cell toxicity, and (ii) chemosensitizing activity of the multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) mechanism. Organic extracts were prepared and cell toxicity was determined using mouse lymphoma cells. The experiments revealed that the major activity is seen {{in the center of the}} mats of the gel-like aggregates; a growth inhibitory activity of up to 54 % (correlated to 5 ml of snow sample) was determined. The same extracts were used to determine the inhibition of the P-glycoprotein (Pgp) <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> which confers the multixenobiotic resistance. The analyses were performed with cells from the sponge Suberites domuncula and with gills from the clam Corbicula fluminea in situ. Both systems have been shown to express the Pgp <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump.</b> The data show that extracts from the outer zone of the gel-like aggregate samples display pronounced inhibitory activity on the MXR <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> and hence act as chemosensitizers by reversing the MXP property. These findings indicate that gel-like aggregates contain compounds in the outer zone, chemosensitizer of the Pgp <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump,</b> which lower the level of protection of metazoan animals towards dissolved compounds in their surrounding milieu, and in the center toxic compounds which are [...] very likely [...] even in the absence of chemosensitizers hazardous for the invertebrates...|$|E

The genetic basis for the strongly enhanced benzene tolerance was investigated by proteome and transcriptome analysis. Indications were found that the highly benzene-tolerant phenotype is the resultant of multilevel systemic changes. The solvent <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> SrpABC was constitutively expressed in P. putida S 12. 49, which {{could be attributed to}} the disruption of the srpS regulator gene by the indigenous mutator element ISS 12. The occurrence of this and two additional transposition events was in good agreement with the increased transcriptional activity of transposase-encoding genes in strain S 12. 49. These observations suggested that transposition events are an important force driving the generation of the genetic diversity apparently required to obtain highly solvent-tolerant phenotypes. In addition, various expression responses relating to energy generation indicated system changes that accommodated the energy demand associated with the high-level expression of the proton-driven solvent <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump.</b> The relatively modest effect of a respiratory chain uncoupler on benzene tolerance in P. putida S 12. 49 indicated the involvement of an alternative, non-respiratory mechanism to maintain the proton gradient. © 2010 Society for Applied Microbiology and Blackwell Publishing Ltd...|$|E

40|$|In {{the present}} study we have {{exploited}} isogenic erg mutants of Saccharomyces cerevisiae to examine the contribution of an altered lipid environment on drug susceptibilities of yeast cells. It is observed that erg mutants, which possess high levels of membrane fluidity, were hypersensitive to the drugs tested, i. e., cycloheximide (CYH), o-phenanthroline, sulfomethuron methyl, 4 -nitroquinoline oxide, and methotrexate. Most of the erg mutants except mutant erg 4 were, however, resistant to fluconazole (FLC). By using the fluorophore rhodamine- 6 G and radiolabeled FLC to monitor the passive diffusion, {{it was observed that}} erg mutant cells elicited enhanced diffusion. The addition of a membrane fluidizer, benzyl alcohol (BA), to S. cerevisiae wild-type cells led to enhanced membrane fluidity. However, a 10 to 12 % increase in BA-induced membrane fluidity did not alter the drug susceptibilities of the S. cerevisiae wild-type cells. The enhanced diffusion observed in erg mutants {{did not seem to be}} solely responsible for the observed hypersensitivity of erg mutants. In order to ascertain the functioning of drug <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps</b> encoding the genes CDR 1 (ATP-binding cassette family) and CaMDR 1 (MFS family) of Candida albicans in a different lipid environment, they were independently expressed in an S. cerevisiae erg mutant background. While the fold change in drug resistance mediated by CaMDR 1 remained the same or increased in erg mutants, susceptibility to FLC and CYH mediated by CDR 1 was increased (decrease in fold resistance). Our results demonstrate that between the two drug <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> Cdr 1 p appeared to be more adversely affected by the fluctuations in the membrane lipid environment (particularly to ergosterol). By using 6 -[(7 -nitrobenz- 2 -oxa- 1, 3 -diazol- 4 -yl) amino-hexanoyl] sphingosyl phosphocholine (a fluorescent analogue of sphingomyelin), a close interaction between membrane ergosterol and sphingomyelin which appears to be disrupted in erg mutants is demonstrated. Taken together it appears that multidrug resistance in yeast is closely linked to the status of membrane lipids, wherein the overall drug susceptibility phenotype of a cell appears to be an interplay among drug diffusion, <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps,</b> and the membrane lipid environment...|$|R
40|$|Kiteplatin, the {{neglected}} drug analogous of cisplatin but containing cis- 1, 4 -DACH {{in place}} of the two ammines, has been recently reevaluated for its activity against cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-resistant tumors, in particular colo-rectal cancer. With the aim of further improving the pharmacological activity of this drug, Pt(IV) prodrugs were derived by addition of two, differently substituted, benzoate groups in axial positions (X-ray structure). The cytotoxic activity of both compounds resulted markedly potentiated reaching nanomolar concentration against a wide panel of human cancer cells. The ability of benzoate ligands to enhance the activity of kiteplatin most likely originates from their lipophilicity promoting a higher drug accumulation in cancer cells; however, it is to be noted that the increase in pharmacological effect is far greater than the increase in cellular uptake. Overcoming cisplatin- and oxaliplatin-resistance by kiteplatin derivatives appears to relate to the inability of membrane <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps</b> to remove active Pt species from tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|The plasma {{membrane}} calcium ATPases (PMCA) are {{a family of}} genes which extrude Ca(2 +) from the cell and {{are involved in the}} maintenance of intracellular free calcium levels and/or with Ca(2 +) signalling, depending on the cell type.

A complex array of mechanisms regulate intracellular free calcium levels in the heart and vasculature and a failure in these systems to maintain normal Ca(2 +) homeostasis has been linked to both heart failure and hypertension. This article focuses on the functions of PMCA, in particular isoform 4 (PMCA 4), in the heart and vasculature and the reported links between PMCAs and contractile function, cardiac hypertrophy, cardiac rhythm and sudden cardiac death, and blood pressure control and hypertension.

Hal 8 p and Hal 9 p are putative zinc fingers and their gene disruptions decreased both salt tolerance and ENA 1 expression.

40|$|RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) {{represents a}} high effective mechanism for specific inhibition of mRNA expression. Besides its {{potential as a}} powerful laboratory tool, the RNAi pathway appears to be promising for therapeutic utilization. For development of RNA interference (RNAi) -based therapies, delivery of RNAi-mediating agents to target cells {{is one of the}} major obstacles. A novel strategy to overcome this hurdle is transkingdom RNAi (tkRNAi). This technology uses non-pathogenic bacteria, e. g. Escherichia coli, to produce and deliver therapeutic short hairpin RNA (shRNA) into target cells to induce RNAi. A first-generation tkRNAi-mediating vector, TRIP, contains the bacteriophage T 7 promoter for expression regulation of a therapeutic shRNA of interest. Furthermore, TRIP has the Inv locus from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis that encodes invasin, which permits natural noninvasive bacteria to enter β 1 -integrin-positive mammalian cells and the HlyA gene from Listeria monocytogenes, which produces listeriolysin O. This enzyme allows the therapeutic shRNA to escape from entry vesicles within the cytoplasm of the target cell. TRIP constructs are introduced into a competent non-pathogenic Escherichia coli strain, which encodes T 7 RNA polymerase necessary for the T 7 promoter-driven synthesis of shRNAs. A well-characterized cancer-associated target molecule for different RNAi strategies is ABCB 1 (MDR 1 /P-glycoprotein, MDR 1 /P-gp). This ABC-transporter acts as a drug <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> and mediates the "classical" ABCB 1 -mediated multidrug resistance (MDR) phenotype of human cancer cells which is characterized by a specific cross resistance pattern. Different ABCB 1 -expressing MDR cancer cells were treated with anti-ABCB 1 shRNA expression vector bearing E. coli. This procedure resulted in activation of the RNAi pathways within the cancer cells and a considerable down regulation of the ABCB 1 encoding mRNA as well as the corresponding drug <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump.</b> Accordingly, drug accumulation was enhanced in the pristine drug-resistant cancer cells and the MDR phenotype was reversed. By means of this model the data provide the proof-of-concept that tkRNAi is suitable for modulation of cancer-associated factors, e. g. ABCB 1, in human cancer cells...|$|E

In this work, the diS-C 3 (3) assay was used to determine the contribution of three main potassium transporters of S. cerevisiae cells (Trk 1 p, Trk 2 p and Tok 1 p) to the membrane potential changes in three different growth phases. It was shown that deletions of these transporters cause hyperpolarisation of the cell membrane in exponential and early diauxic growth phases; no difference was detected in post-diauxic cells. Another contribution of this work is in a deeper study of the activity of ABC pumps which are crucial in multidrug resistance. It was proved that apart from Pdr 5 p and Snq 2 p pumps, there are also other active <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps</b> (most likely Pdr 10 p and Pdr 15 p). It was also showed that pdr 1, pdr 3 mutant strain is not an equivalent of strain lacking the multidrug pumps Pdr 5 p, Snq 2 p and Yor 1 p. The results in this work indicate that dis-C 3 (3) probe is probably a substrate of other pumps such as Pdr 15 p. Study of these transporters with our method is thus very suitable and could provide detailed information about their kinetics and help in finding their inhibitors.

Lesional, perilesional, {{as well as}} normal brain regions were examined {{for the expression of}} the multidrug resistance gene 1 encoded P-glycoprotein (P-gp) and the multidrug resistance-associated protein 1 (MRP 1) by immunocytochemistry. In normal brain MRP 1 expression was below detection, whereas P-gp staining was present only in blood vessels. MRP 1 and P-gp immunoreactivity was observed in dysplastic neurons of 11 / 15 cases of focal cortical dysplasia, {{as well as in the}} neuronal component of 14 / 15 ganglioglioma. Glial cells with astrocytic morphology within the lesion showed multidrug-resistant protein immunoreactivity (P-gp>MRP 1). Moderate to strong MRP 1 and P-gp immunoreactivity was observed in a population of large ballooned neuroglial cells. P-gp appeared to be most frequently expressed in glial fibrillary acidic protein-positive balloon cells (glial type), whereas MRP 1 was more frequently expressed in microtubule-associated protein 2 -positive balloon cells (neuronal type). In both types of lesions strong P-gp immunoreactivity was found in lesional vessels. Perilesional regions did not show increased staining in vessels or in neuronal cells compared with normal cortex. The predominant intralesional cell-specific {{distribution of}} multidrug transporter proteins supports the hypothesis of a constitutive overexpression as common mechanism underlying the intrinsic pharmaco-resistance to antiepileptic drugs of both malformative and neoplastic glioneuronal developmental lesions.

To understand {{the basis of}} this differential resistance, we performed a functional screen for C. albicans genes involved in copper detoxification. Here, we report the isolation of two such genes: a metallothionein, CaCUP 1, and a copper-transporting P-type ATPase, CaCRP 1. Both genes are induced by extracellular copper. Gene disruptions indicated that the copper <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> is responsible for the unusual resistance of C. albicans to copper, whereas the metallothionein is responsible for the residual copper resistance of the Cacrp 1 Δ mutant. We show further that under acidic and anaerobic conditions, such as prevail in the natural niche of C. albicans, the digestive tract of animals, CaCRP 1 function becomes essential for survival in the presence of even very low copper concentrations. These observations suggest that copper in the gastrointestinal tract may present a toxic challenge to which enteric organisms had to adapt...|$|E

The present investigation {{has studied the}} influence of A 23187 on blood platelet aggregation and secretion. A 23187 added to stirred C-PRP produced concentration-dependent aggregation and release of 14 C-serotonin. Calcium ions potentiated the response of platelets in washed suspensions to A 23187, {{but they were not}} required for ionophore-induced aggregation or release. N-ethylmaleimide and agents which increase the level of cyclic 3 ′, 5 ′-adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) in platelets were effective inhibitors of A 23187 -induced aggregation and secretion. Platelets incubated with 45 Ca++ before addition of A 23187 increased their content of isotope by 50 % within 45 seconds after exposure to the ionophore. The results indicate that an increase in the cytoplasmic concentration of calcium ions from intracellular sources may be the critical event in triggering platelet contraction and the release reaction. Increased concentrations of cAMP may inhibit the platelet response to A 23187 and other aggregating agents by stimulating a calcium <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump...</b>|$|E
40|$|A reaction-diffusion {{model is}} {{presented}} to encapsulate calcium-induced calcium release (CICR) as a potential mechanism for somatofugal bias of dendritic calcium movement in starburst amacrine cells. Calcium dynamics involves a simple calcium <b>extrusion</b> (<b>pump)</b> and a buffering mechanism of calcium binding proteins homogeneously distributed over the plasma membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum within starburst amacrine cells. The system of reaction-diffusion equations in the excess buffer (or low calcium concentration) approximation are reformulated as a nonlinear Volterra integral equation which is solved analytically via a regular perturbation series expansion in response to calcium feedback from a continuously and uniformly distributed calcium sources. Calculation of luminal calcium diffusion {{in the absence of}} buffering enables a wave to travel at distances of 120 mu m from the soma to distal tips of a starburst amacrine cell dendrite in 100 msec, yet in the presence of discretely distributed calcium-binding proteins it is unknown whether the propagating calcium wave-front in the somatofugal direction is further impeded by endogenous buffers. If so, this would indicate CICR to be an unlikely mechanism of retinal direction selectivity in starburst amacrine cells...|$|E

40|$|Angiogenesis is the {{formation}} of new blood vessels from pre-existing ones. Unregulated angiogenesis is associated with several diseases such as diabetic retinopathy and tumour growth. Many signal transduction pathways have been implicated in the regulation of angiogenesis such as p 38 mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK), phosphatidylinositol- 3 kinase (PI 3 K), extracellular signal-related kinase 1 / 2 (Erk 1 / 2) and of particular interest the calcineurin/nuclear factor of activated T-cell (NFAT) pathway. Inhibition of calcineurin activity by the drug cyclopsorin A (CsA) {{has been shown to}} inhibit processes required for successful angiogenesis such as in vitro cell migration, tube formation and additionally attenuates corneal angiogenesis in vivo. CsA is associated with severe side effects and therefore the identification of an endogenous regulator of this pathway would be beneficial. One possibility is the plasma membrane calcium ATPases (PMCAs). These high affinity calcium <b>extrusion</b> <b>pumps</b> have been shown to interact with calcineurin in mammalian cells and cardiomyocytes and down-regulate the calcineurin/NFAT pathway. This is hypothesised to be due to the interaction between the two proteins which maintains calcineurin in a low calcium micro-environment generated by the calcium removal function of the pump. Interestingly, PMCA 4 has been shown to interact with calcineurin in endothelial cells. The aim of our study was to further our understanding of PMCA 4 s regulation of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway specifically in endothelial cells and establish if PMCA 4 has a role in the regulation of angiogenesis. ‘Gain of function’ by adenoviral over-expression of PMCA 4 and ‘loss of function’ by either si-RNA mediated knockdown of PMCA 4 or isolation of PMCA 4 -/- MLEC were used as models. Over-expression of PMCA 4 in HUVEC resulted in inhibition of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway with the opposite result occurring {{in the case of the}} knockout of PMCA 4, identifying PMCA 4 as a negative-regulator of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in endothelial cells. Over-expression of PMCA 4 significantly attenuated VEGF-induced protein and mRNA expression of the pro-angiogenic proteins RCAN 1. 4 and Cox- 2, endothelial cell migration and in vitro and in vivo tube formation with the opposite result occurring in knockdown or knockout studies, confirming PMCA 4 as a down-regulator of angiogenesis. Interestingly, over-expression or knockdown of PMCA 4 had no effect on VEGF-induced HUVEC proliferation or Erk 1 / 2 phopshorylation proposing PMCA 4 may be a potential inhibitor of angiogenesis without compromising cell survival. Disruption of the interaction between PMCA 4 and calcineurin by generation and ectopic expression of an adenovirus encoding the region of PMCA 4 that interacts with calcineurin (428 - 651) (Ad-ID 4) resulted in an increase in NFAT activity, RCAN 1. 4 protein expression and in vitro tube formation. These results identify the mechanism of PMCA 4 s inhibitory effect of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway and consequently angiogenesis is a result of the interaction between the two proteins. The novel findings of this study establish PMCA 4 as a negative-regulator of the calcineurin/NFAT pathway in endothelial cells and angiogenesis. These results are far reaching and highlight a potential role for PMCA 4 as a therapeutic target in a variety of diseases that are associated with pathological angiogenesis...|$|R

At the onset of active glycine uptake the component of Δψ which depended on metabolism was decreased. The depolarized membrane repolarized in the presence of glycine. This glycine-induced depolarization followed a saturation curve with increasing glycine concentration which corresponded to carrier-mediated glycine influx kinetics. The transport of glycine was correlated with the metabolically dependent component of Δψ. It is suggested (a) that the transient change in Δψ reflects the operation of an H+-glycine cotransport system driven by an electrochemical H+ gradient; and (b) that this system is energized by an active H+ extrusion.

Steady-state levels of calcium accumulation are attained in 40 – 60 min. Calcium uptake requires adenosine triphosphate (ATP), is enhanced by oxalate, and is accompanied by the release of inorganic phosphate. Calcium accumulation and phosphate release require magnesium and are inhibited by Salyrgan (10 µM) and adenosine diphosphate (ADP) (1 mM), but not by ouabain (0. 1 mM). The ATPase activity is stimulated by low concentrations of calcium (5 – 10 µM) and is inhibited by 2 mM EGTA. Electron microscopic histochemistry using lead nitrate to precipitate released phosphate results in lead precipitates localized primarily at the inner surface of membrane vesicles.

Abstract To define the time course and potential effects of electrical stimulation on permanently denervated muscle, we evaluated excitation-contraction coupling (ECC) of rat leg muscles during progression to long-term denervation by ultrastructural analysis, specific binding to dihydropyridine receptors, ryanodine receptor 1 (RYR- 1), Ca channels and <b>extrusion</b> Ca <b>pumps,</b> gene transcription and translation of Ca-handling proteins, and in vitro mechanical properties and electrophysiological analyses of sarcolemmal passive properties and L-type Ca current (ICa) parameters. We {{found that in}} response to long-term denervation: 1) isolated muscle that is unable to twitch in vitro by electrical stimulation has very small myofibers but may show a slow caffeine contracture; 2) only roughly half of the muscle fibers with "voltage-dependent Ca channel activity" are able to contract; 3) the ECC mechanisms are still present and, in part, functional; 4) ECC-related gene expression is upregulated; and 5) at any time point, there are muscle fibers that are more resistant than others to denervation atrophy and disorganization of the ECC apparatus. These results {{support the hypothesis that}} prolonged "resting" [Ca] may drive progression of muscle atrophy to degeneration and that electrical stimulation-induced [Ca] modulation may mimic the lost nerve influence, playing a key role in modifying the gene expression of denervated muscle. Hence, these data provide a potential molecular explanation for the muscle recovery that occurs in response to rehabilitation strategies developed based on empirical clinical observations.

H 1 entry into everted vesicle was strongly inhibited by SCH 28080 (IC 50 5; 40 mM) and by omeprazole (IC 50 5; 50 mM), both of which are characteristic inhibitors of mammalian gastric H 1,K 1 -ATPase. H 1 influx was completely insensitive to ouabain (250 mM), the typical inhibitor of Na 1,K 1 -ATPase. Mg 21 - ATPase activity could be partially stimulated with K 1 (20 mM) that was inhibitable (> 85...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{overview}} is to introduce the property of {{a new class of}} hazardous chemicals-the inhibitors of multixenobiotic resistance (MXR) in aquatic organisms, referred to as chemosensitizers. Aquatic organisms possess MXR, a mechanism similar to the well-known P-glycoprotein <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> in multidrug resistant (MDR) tumor cells. MXR in aquatic organism moves from cells and organisms both endogenous chemicals and xenobiotics, including also some man-made chemicals. MXR in aquatic organisms represents a general biological first-line defense mechanism for protection against environmental toxins. Many chemical agents, the chemosensitizers, may after the function of this fragile mechanism. It is this new, MXR-inhibiting property, unrecognized as yet, that classifies these chemicals among top-rank hazardous water pollutants. The knowledge that the presence of one xenobiotic may block the pumping out of other xenobiotic(s), and hence accelerate their accumulation, may have important implications on environmental parameters like exposure, uptake, bioaccumulation, and toxicity. In this overview we present the evidence for the expression of MXR-phenotype in aquatic organisms, the demonstration of toxic consequences caused by MXR inhibitors, and the description of methods for measurement of concentration of MXR inhibitors in environmental samples...|$|E
40|$|Missense {{mutations}} in ATP 2 A 1 gene, encoding SERCA 1 protein, cause a muscle disorder designed as congenital pseudomyotonia (PMT) in Chianina and Romagnola cattle or congenital muscular dystonia 1 (CMD 1) in Belgian Blue cattle. Although PMT is not life-threatening, CMD 1 affected calves usually die {{within a few}} weeks of age as a result of respiratory complication. We have recently described a muscular disorder in a double muscle Dutch Improved Red and White cross-breed calf. Mutation analysis revealed an ATP 2 A 1 mutation identical to that described in CMD 1, even though clinical phenotype was quite similar to that of PMT. Here, we provide evidence for a deficiency of mutated SERCA 1 in PMT affected muscles of Dutch Improved Red and White calf, but not of its mRNA. The reduced expression of SERCA 1 is selective and not compensated by the SERCA 2 isoform. By contrast, pathological muscles are characterized by a broad distribution of mitochondrial markers in all fiber types, not related to intrinsic features of double muscle phenotype and by an increased expression of sarcolemmal calcium <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump.</b> Calcium removal mechanisms, operating in muscle fibers as compensatory response aimed at lowering excessive cytoplasmic calcium concentration caused by SERCA 1 deficiency, could explain the difference in severity of clinical signs...|$|E
40|$|Ca(2 +) in neurons {{is vital}} to {{processes}} such as neurotransmission, neurotoxicity, synaptic development, and gene expression. Disruption of Ca(2 +) homeostasis occurs in brain aging and in neurodegenerative disorders. Membrane transporters, among them the calmodulin (CaM) -activated plasma membrane Ca(2 +) ATPases (PMCAs) that extrude Ca(2 +) from the cell, {{play a key role}} in neuronal Ca(2 +) homeostasis. Using X-exome sequencing we have identified a missense mutation (G 1107 D) in the CaM-binding domain of isoform 3 of the PMCAs in a family with X-linked congenital cerebellar ataxia. PMCA 3 is highly expressed in the cerebellum, particularly in the presynaptic terminals of parallel fibers-Purkinje neurons. To study the effects of the mutation on Ca(2 +) <b>extrusion</b> by the <b>pump,</b> model cells (HeLa) were cotransfected with expression plasmids encoding its mutant or wild-type (wt) variants and with the Ca(2 +) -sensing probe aequorin. The mutation reduced the ability of the PMCA 3 pump to control the cellular homeostasis of Ca(2 +). It significantly slowed the return to baseline of the Ca(2 +) transient induced by an inositol-trisphosphate (InsP(3)) -linked plasma membrane agonist. It also compromised the ability of the pump to oppose the influx of Ca(2 +) through the plasma membrane capacitative channels...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: Many {{isolates}} of Serratia marcescens, {{a well-known}} opportunistic pathogen, can be multidrug resistant. Fluoroquinolones {{are among the}} most important groups of antibiotics used for treatment of these organisms. However, fluoroquinolone resistance among S. marcescens isolates is fast increasing. Drug <b>extrusion</b> through efflux <b>pumps</b> like SdeAB/ HasF {{is one of the major}} mechanisms of resistance to fluoroquinolones. This study was carried out to analyze, through gene expression analysis of sdeB, the relative contribution of this mechanism toward fluoroquinolone resistance in clinical isolates of Serratia. Materials and Methods: Total RNA from 45 clinical isolates of S. marcescens was isolated. Quantitative real-time RT PCR was performed on the extracted RNA to study the gene expression of sdeB and was normalized to the sdeB expression in the standard strain of S. marcescens. Results: Of the 45 isolates analyzed, sdeB expression was found to be elevated in 20 isolates (44 %). Of these 20 isolates, eight (40 %) were fully resistant to at least one of the fluoroquinolones studied. Conversely, of the 20 isolates that over-expressed sdeB, 12 (60 %) were fully sensitive to all fluoroquinolones tested. Conclusions: Drug efflux pumps are an important means of fluoroquinolone resistance among clinically important species ofSerratia. The expression of these pumps can be up-regulated in the presence of antibiotics and have the potential for changing the phenotype from sensitive to resistant, thus contributing to therapeutic failures...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Combined ion flux and {{electrophysiological}} measurements {{have been}} used to characterize active transport of potassium by cells of Neurospora crassa that have been moderately starved of K+ and then maintained in the presence of millimolar free calcium ions. These conditions elicit a high-affinity (K,, = 1 - 10 /aM) potassium uptake system that is strongly depolarizing. Currentvoltage measurements have demonstrated a K+-associated inward current exceeding (at saturation) half the total current normally driven outward through the plasma membrane proton pump. Potassium activity ratios and fluxes have been compared quantitatively with electrophysiological parameters, by using small (^- 15 um diam) spherical cells ofNeurospora grown in ethylene glycol. All data are consistent with a transport mechanism that carries K ions inward by cotransport with H ions, which move down the electrochemical gradient created by the primary proton pump. The stoichiometry of entry is 1 K ion with 1 H ion; overall charge balance is maintained by <b>pumped</b> <b>extrusion</b> of two protons, to yield a net flux stoichiometry of 1 K + exchanging for 1 H+. The mechanism is competent to sustain the largest stable K+ gradients that have been measured in Neurospora, with no direct contribution from phosphate hydrolysis or redox processes. Such a potassium-proton symport mechanism could account for many observations reported on K+ movement in other fungi, in algae, and in higher plants...|$|R
40|$|Purkinje {{cells are}} the {{principal}} neurons of the cerebellar cortex and have an extensive and elaborate dendritic tree. Chronic activation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors inhibits Purkinje cell dendritic growth in organotypic cerebellar slice cultures. This effect is mediated by calcium influx through P/Q-type and T-type Ca 2 + channels. We have now studied {{the role of the}} plasma membrane Ca 2 +-ATPase 2 (PMCA 2), a major calcium <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump,</b> for Purkinje cell dendritic development. We found that PMCA 2 is strongly expressed in the plasma membrane and dendritic spines of Purkinje cells in organotypic slice cultures compatible with a role for controlling the local dendritic calcium equilibrium. Inhibition of PMCA 2 activity by carboxyeosin resulted in a moderate reduction of Purkinje cell dendritic tree size indicating that the extrusion of calcium by PMCA 2 is important for maintaining the dendritic calcium concentration and controlling dendritic growth. When inhibition of PMCA 2 was combined with stimulation of type I metabotropic glutamate receptors, it partially rescued dendritic morphology. This protection can be explained by a compensatory inactivation of voltage-gated calcium channels in Purkinje cells after PMCA 2 inhibition. Our results demonstrate that PMCA 2 activity is an important regulator of the dendritic calcium equilibrium controlling Purkinje cell dendritic growth...|$|E

40|$|CK 2 is a {{pleiotropic}} protein kinase, which phosphorylates many substrates and has {{a global}} role in promoting cell survival and preventing apoptosis. In this study, we investigated its involvement in {{the phenomenon of the}} drug resistance, by which tumor cells frequently become unresponsive to chemical apoptosis. By comparing the expression of CK 2 subunits in four different pairs of sensitive (S) and resistant (R) cancer cell lines, we found that in three cases the resistant phenotype is accompanied by the overexpression of the CK 2 catalytic alpha subunit, either alone or in combination with the regulatory beta subunit. The degree of CK 2 expression correlates with the CK 2 catalytic activity, when measured toward endogenous protein substrates. All the tested R cell lines, including the one with no CK 2 overexpression, can be induced to undergo death by treatment with CK 2 inhibitors. We therefore conclude that, although CK 2 overexpression is not an absolute requirement for the resistant phenotype, its activity is essential for cell survival and contributes to a high degree of resistance. We also found that CK 2 inhibition increases the accumulation of cytotoxic drugs inside the R cells, presumably by impairing the functionality of the <b>extrusion</b> <b>pump</b> P-gp. We therefore propose that CK 2 should be considered a target to counteract the pharmaco-resistant phenotype...|$|E
40|$|Elevated [Ca 2 +]i in deoxygenated {{sickle cell}} anemia (SS) red cells (RBCs) could trigger a major {{dehydration}} pathway via the Ca(2 +) -sensitive K+ channel. But apart from an increase in calcium permeability, the effects of deoxygenation on the Ca 2 + metabolism of sickle cells have not been previously documented. With the application of 45 Ca(2 +) -tracer flux methods and the combined use of the ionophore A 23187, Co 2 + ions, and intracellular incorporation of the Ca 2 + chelator benz- 2, in density-fractionated SS RBCs, we show {{here for the first}} time that upon deoxygenation, the mean [Ca 2 +]i level of SS discocytes was significantly increased, two- to threefold, from a normal range of 9. 4 to 11. 4 nM in the oxygenated cells, to a range of 21. 8 to 31. 7 nM in the deoxygenated cells, closer to K+ channel activatory levels. Unlike normal RBCs, deoxygenated SS RBCs showed a two- to fourfold increase in pump-leak Ca 2 + turnover. Deoxygenation of the SS RBCs reduced their Ca 2 + pump Vmax, more so in reticulocyte- and discocyte-rich than in dense cell fractions, and decreased their cytoplasmic Ca 2 + buffering. Analysis of these results suggests that both increased Ca 2 + influx and reduced Ca 2 + <b>pump</b> <b>extrusion</b> contribute to the [Ca 2 +]i elevation...|$|R
40|$|Understanding {{the genetic}} {{pathways}} that regulate how pathogenic fungi {{respond to their}} environment is paramount to developing effective mitigation strategies against disease. Carbon catabolite repression (CCR) is a global regulatory mechanism found {{in a wide range}} of microbial organisms that ensures the preferential utilization of glucose over less favourable carbon sources, but little is known about the components of CCR in filamentous fungi. Here we report three new mediators of CCR in the devastating rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae: the sugar sensor Tps 1, the Nmr 1 - 3 inhibitor proteins, and the multidrug and toxin <b>extrusion</b> (MATE) –family <b>pump,</b> Mdt 1. Using simple plate tests coupled with transcriptional analysis, we show that Tps 1, in response to glucose- 6 -phosphate sensing, triggers CCR via the inactivation of Nmr 1 - 3. In addition, by dissecting the CCR pathway using Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated mutagenesis, we also show that Mdt 1 is an additional and previously unknown regulator of glucose metabolism. Mdt 1 regulates glucose assimilation downstream of Tps 1 and is necessary for nutrient utilization, sporulation, and pathogenicity. This is the first functional characterization of a MATE–family protein in filamentous fungi and the first description of a MATE protein in genetic regulation or plant pathogenicity. Perturbing CCR in Dtps 1 and MDT 1 disruption strains thus results in physiological defects that impact pathogenesis, possibly through the early expression of cell wall–degrading enzymes. Taken together, the importance of discovering three new regulators of carbon metabolism lies in understanding how M. oryzae and othe...|$|R
40|$|High-affinity {{potassium}} uptake in Neurospora occurs by symport with protons [Km (apparent) = 15 microM at pH 5. 8], {{for which}} a large inward gradient (approximately 400 mV) is generated by the H+-extruding ATPase of the plasma membrane. Operating in parallel, the two transport systems yield a net 1 : 1 exchange of K+ for cytoplasmic H+. Since this exchange could {{play a role in}} cytoplasmic pH (pHi) regulation, the coordinated functioning of the K+-H+ symport and H+ pump has been examined during acid stress. Cytoplasmic acid loads were imposed by injection and by exposure to extracellular permeant weak acid. Multibarrelled microelectrodes were used to monitor membrane potential (Vm), pHi, and the current-voltage (I-V) characteristics of the cells. The behaviors of the H+ pump and K+-H+ symport were resolved, respectively, by fitting whole membrane I-V curves to an explicit kinetic model of the Neurospora membrane and by subtracting I-V curves obtained in the absence from those obtained in the presence of 5 - 200 microM K+ outside. Proton pumping accelerates nearly in proportion with the cytoplasmic H+ concentration, but pHi recovery from imposed acid loads is dependent on micromolar K+ outside. Potassium import via the symport leads to a measurable alkalinization of the cytoplasm in accordance with stoichiometric (1 : 1) K+/H+ exchange. Potassium transport is accelerated at low pHi, but {{in a manner consistent with}} its inherent voltage sensitivity and changes in Vm resulting from an increased rate of H+ <b>extrusion</b> by the <b>pump.</b> The primary response to acid stress thus rests with the H+ pump, but K+ transport introduces an essential kinetic "valve" that can regulate net H+ export...|$|R
