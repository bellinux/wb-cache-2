Several explanations can be considered, but this work focuses {{on the effect of}} additives contained in the lubricant. Rolling contact fatigue tests were performed on a twin-disc machine. Artificial dents generated by a Rockwell penetrator were made on the faster surface in order to accelerate the fatigue phenomena. Then, pure rolling and 6. 7 per cent slip (slide-to-roll ratio (SRR)) tests were performed with different lubricants (pure base oil, fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil,</b> and base oil with detergent and anti-foam). Fatigue life results and spalling morphologies are compared. For the sample obtained with the fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> and 6. 7 per cent of SRR, crack analysis was performed. Using focus-ion-beam technique, a spalled sample was milled to reveal a cross-section of a crack. Secondary electron microscopy (SEM) images were taken and energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDX) analyses along the crack were performed. Additive elements are detected up to the crack tip. Auger electron spectroscopy depth profiling was also performed in the tribofilm generated on the disc surface. The role of additives in rolling contact fatigue is discussed in the light of these results...|$|E

The candidate lubricants were a formulated engine lubricant, (CD SAE 15 W- 40) and a base oil (150 SN). Soot particle contamination was simulated using carbon black with friction and wear measured using a four-ball tribometer. The results show that the antiwear and antifriction properties of the CD SAE 15 W- 40 <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> with varying carbon black contents were better than those of 150 SN base oil. The antifriction properties of the SAE 15 W‐ 40 <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> with the addition of 2 wt% carbon black were strengthened. This was ascribed to uniformly dispersed carbon black and the additives in the CD SAE 15 W- 40. The antifriction properties of the 150 SN base oil with 2, 4 wt% carbon black content were upgraded via the addition of 2 wt% dispersant polyisobutylene succinimide. The tribological effect of the carbon black in the lubricants was attributed to absorption and agglomerate effects...|$|E

The objectives of this work are (1) to evaluate the compatibility of lubricant with DLC in the boundary lubrication regime by laboratory tribo-test (2) to investigate lubrication mechanism using instrumental analysis. The coatings tested are hydrogen-free/sp 3 -rich/amorphous carbon with/without after treatment, hydrogenated amorphous carbon with WC-doping, Cr-doped DLC with hydrogenated amorphous carbon top layer. The base oil was a poly-alpha olefin containing model friction modifier additives: glycerol mono-oleate, oleylamine and oleylamide. The concentration of additive was 1 mass %. Commercially available fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> was employed as a reference. The tribological properties were evaluated according to ASTM D 6425. A contact stress of 0. 1 GPa, a frequency of 50 Hz, a stroke of 1 mm were applied in the tribo-test. The resultant worn surfaces were studied by an SEM-EDX and a 3 D-profilometer.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The introduction of overhead camshaft valve train systems some 25 years ago has resulted in improved engine performance and efficiency, this in turn however, has caused increased wear problems. In {{order to understand the}} tribological behaviour of overhead camshaft systems, test engines and dynameter test methods have been extensively used. These are however, time consuming and expensive, a cheaper and quicker method of camshaft material and lubricant appraisal is therefore required and this has resulted in the design and construction of a simulative overhead camshaft test rig. A range of commercially available camshaft and follower materials have been tested using both a fully formulated and a -mineral base -equivalent. The most commonly encountered cam and follower wear failures of scuffing, pitting and polishing were reproduced. Results showed scuffing wear to be associated with all of the camshaft materials using the mineral base oil under high load, boundary lubrication conditions. Scuffing also occurred under low load, mixed lubrication conditions using the case-hardened steel cam and chilled white iron follower combinations. The remaining cam materials, carbonitrided and induction hardened grey flake iron did not fail under similar test conditions due to the presence of free graphite in the icrostructure. The fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> generally suppressed the onset of scuffing under all test conditions due to the presence of the zinc-dialkyldithiophosphate (Z. D. D. P) anti-wear additive in the oil. Pitting failure was associated with the chilled white iron follower using the fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> under high load conditions. This failure could have been initiated by either a surface, sub-surface or stress - corrosion mechanism. Analysis of this type of failure is complicated by the difference in both chill depth and hardness and also the presence. of cracks within, samples prior to examination and testing. Standardisation of chilled white irons therefore needs to be carried out in order to understand fully the wear behaviour of such materials. Polishing wear was associated with the fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> at low loads, and appeared to occur by a chemical reaction between the contacting surfaces and the additives present in the oil. The use of the acetate replica technique proved a satisfactory method of analysing the change in surface topography of cam surfaces. Using the fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> the cam surface 'ran in' satisfactorily, by a process of plastic deformation and fracture, whilst the mineral base oil caused instanteous scuffing of the cam surface. Once the surfaces had 'run in' satisfactorily by using either the additives in the oil or by a diamond lapping operation, the cams continued to run without scuffing in the mineral base oil under continuous, non stop test conditions. An intermittent, stop/start operating cycle however results in eventual scuffing due to additive film depletion and repeated surface interaction under boundary lubrication conditions. From a range of 'new' materials tested for follower application the ceramics, {{with the exception of the}} toughened zirconia, exhibited the best wear characteristics using a case hardened steel cam as a standard and tested under mineral base oil conditions. The silicon carbide and sialon ceramics both exhibited a low frictional resistance and wear rate, whilst the metallic follower materials of cobalt and nickel base hard facing alloys and a ceramic fibre reinforced aluminium/silicon alloy all suffered some form of material.

40|$|International audienceRolling contact fatigue {{has become}} a surface {{initiated}} problem. This phenomenon {{is due to the}} initiation and propagation of cracks from the surface to the volume of mechanical pieces. A great amount of research has been done since the 1970 s to understand its origin, but many aspects remain unclear. Many authors found that the lubricant composition and especially certain additives can either improve or reduce fatigue life, depending on the operating conditions. It is now admitted that additives form a tribofilm in the rubbing track, especially under pure sliding conditions, but no direct relation to rolling contact fatigue has been drawn to this moment.

40|$|The {{reduction}} of friction and wear losses in boundary lubrication regime of a piston ring-cylinder liner tribo-system {{has always been}} a challenge for engine and lubricant manufacturers. One way is to use lubricant additives, which can form boundary film quickly and reduce the direct contact between asperities. This article focuses on the assessment of boundary film forming behavior of two phosphonium-based ionic liquids (ILs) as additives in engine-aged lubricant to further improve its film forming capabilities and hence reduce friction and wear of contacting surfaces. A reciprocating piston ring segment-on-flat coupon under fully flooded lubrication conditions at room temperature (approx. 25 °C) was employed. The trihexyltetradecyl phosphonium bis(2 -ethylhexyl) phosphate and trihexyltetradecyl phosphonium bis(2, 4, 4 -tri-methylpentyl) phosphinate ionic liquids were used as additives in 6 vol. % quantity. Benchmark tests were conducted using fully formulated new lubricant of same grade (with and without ILs). Results revealed that the addition of phosphonium ILs to engine-aged lubricant led to quicker initiation of boundary film forming process.

40|$|Diamond-like carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} are recognised as {{a promising}} {{way to reduce}} friction and improve wear performance of automotive engine components. DLC coatings provide new possibilities in {{the improvement of the}} tribological performance of automotive components beyond what can be achieved with lubricant design alone. Lubricants are currently designed for metallic surfaces, the tribology of which is well defined and documented. DLC does not share this depth of tribological knowledge; thus, its practical implementation is stymied. In this work, three DLC coatings are tested: an amorphous hydrogenated DLC, a silicone-doped amorphous hydrogenated DLC and a tungsten-doped amorphous hydrogenated DLC. The three coatings are tested tribologically on a pin-on-reciprocating plate tribometer against a cast iron pin in a group III base oil, and a fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> that consists of a group III base oil and contains ZDDP, at 100 °C for 6 h and for 20 h in order to determine whether a phosphor-based tribofilm is formed at the contact.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerning}} about hydrodynamic lubrication in journal bearing. The research covers three primary areas: {{the formulation of}} an alternative biodegradable biolubricant using renewable resources; the performance evaluation of the <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> through a true-scale versatile journal bearing test rig; and the modeling and prediction the behavior of bio-lubricant around the bearing circumference. The {{first part of the}} research is focused upon the formulation of an environmentally-friendly lubricant using vegetable oil with various composition of petroleum base stock. The physico-chemical and tribo-chemical properties of the <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> have been analyzed using multiple standards apparatuses. This study provides valuable data to conform an ISO VG 68 hydraulic industrial lubricant by blending 52. 70 % (wt) soybean oil, 40. 55 % (wt) mineral oil, and 6. 75 (%) additive packages. The experimental results clearly demonstrated that the formulated green lubricant was far more efficient than the synthetic lubricant in terms of friction coefficient, wear rates, wear volume loss and worn surface morphologies. However, the green lubricant failed to outperform conventional lubricant with respect to degradation test and wear scar diameter performance. From this study, the use of bio-lubricants as ‘green’ alternatives for machine lubrications will be significant in the reduction of environmental pollution and depletion of natural resources. The second part is about evaluating the performance of this novel bio-lubricant under practical application conditions and also to design a new eco-friendly lubricant-bearing combination in which the end goal was to maximize friction coefficient reduction and safeguard the environment. Two different bearings made of conventional steel and green lead-free materials were tested at various operating conditions. The formulated blend proved its viability as a promising alternate for base oil lubricants for industrial use due to its better performance, lower friction, lower operating temperature and on top of all, its bio-degradability and environment friendliness. This can contribute to reduce the global demand of petroleum-based lubricant substantially. The established lubricant-bearing duo is capable of replacing typical lubricants and bearing materials that include lead with regards to its higher availability and superb performance. The third part of this research is the first attempt to develop high-fidelity mathematical models based on Response Surface Methodology (RSM), which can be used to predict the hydrodynamic lubrication behavior of the bio-oil around the journal bearing circumference. The study employed the response surface methodology (RSM) with Box-Behnken experimental Design technique (BBD) for performing statistical predictions and appraising the influence of the three-level-three-independent variables (i. e. rotational speed, bearing load and oil-feed pressure) on the oil-film key characteristics (i. e. maximum pressure, temperature and bearing friction). Another exceptional aspect of this research was the examination of the embedded interactions among the three key parameters. This facilitated the acquirement of deeper knowledge regarding the significance of every parameter. Finally, a comparative study was conducted between the estimated data generated through RSM based models and the outcomes developed through fiizzy logic technique.

40|$|It is {{well known}} that thin {{coatings}} can provide increased lifetime and reduced energy consumption for tools and components. During use, e. g. in sliding contact, mechanical and chemical reactions often lead to the formation of new surface layers, tribofilms, possessing different properties compared to the original surface, hence affecting the overall performance. In this work, analytical electron microscopy was applied to investigate the structure and composition of tribofilms. Concerning coatings, deposition parameter dependencies, stability and tribology were investigated. The carbon content of hydrogen-free TiCx coatings was shown to significantly influence the morphology. Low carbon content resulted in columnar grains with a strong texture while high carbon content {{led to the formation of}} randomly ordered TiCx crystals. The application of positive bias to the substrate as opposed to the normally used negative bias gave a fibrous structure of sputtered TiB 2 and low residual stress with maintained hardness. Further, oxidation stability was examined on a (Ta,Al) C:C coating where oxidation led to partial oxidation and formation of AlTaO 4 with an 8 nm interface. A focused ion beam instrument was used to extract samples from certain areas of worn specimens. Tribological contact was observed to result in phase changes and intermixing of materials present in the contact. Sliding contact involving a Co-alloy led to a phase change from fcc to hcp.

40|$|Diamondlike-carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} {{have received}} a lot of research attention by physicists and engineers, especially in the past 25 years. Attempts to use such materials in tribological applications have achieved variable success. The rationale for this work was to investigate the wear durability of three types of DLC coatings applied to hardened and tempered bearing steel and subject them to realistic high pressure cyclic loading under oil lubricated conditions for long duration. A thrust bearing design was deployed for this purpose. The wear and friction behavior of the DLC coated materials relative to uncoated materials was compared when using base (additive free) oils and typical autoengine formulated oils. The type of oil used made no difference to the dynamic friction and oil temperature for all the material and oil combinations used. Durability of the coated and uncoated roller bearings was determined by the type of material. For the uncoated bearings, life was limited after very many test cycles (approaching a billion) via classical rolling contact fatigue pitting. For all the DLC coated rollers life was governed by wear of their coatings. In the case of the tungsten doped DLCs (a-C:H:W), these were worn progressively and uniformly via microabrasion, whereas the nondoped ta-C and a-C DLC coatings were principally worn via delamination and tearing. The latter effect was relatively rapid and was considered to be initiated by blistering of the coating, a process that was probably driven by the high elastic energy/internal stress within the nondoped coating materials. The durability to delamination and tearing of the ta-C coatings was slightly lowered in <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> compared to tests made in base oil. Overall, for the test conditions used here, there was no apparent benefit in using DLC coatings...|$|E

Also, conidial germination on tick cuticle was delayed in comparison to germination on artificial culture medium; for example, germination was 13 % on tick cuticle 72 h after inoculation, in contrast to 61. 5 % on PDAY medium. Unheated (27 °C) conidia suspended in either water or oil and applied to tick cuticle developed appressoria 36 h after treatment; whereas only heat-stressed conidia <b>formulated</b> in <b>oil</b> developed appressoria on tick cuticle.

40|$|An {{experiment}} using a purpose-built {{test rig}} {{to examine the}} effect of oil chemistry on the charging ability of various oils revealed that the charge produced depends on two extrinsic properties; the electric field (used to charge the droplet) and the droplet radius. A normalization parameter was developed from these dependencies and used to compare the results from the tests described herein. Four classes of liquids were tested. These were pure hydrocarbon liquids (hexadecane, decane, and squalane), base oils (both mineral and synthetic stocks), <b>formulated</b> <b>oils</b> (mineral base oil with additives), and commercial <b>oils</b> (fully <b>formulated</b> mineral and synthetic oils, available over-the-counter). The charging for both pure hydrocarbons and base oils indicates that the charged species have a low mobility and thus are likely to be large, bulky molecules. For this reason, the charging of the base oils is noticeably time dependent and the charge imparted on the oil did not always reach saturation. The charging (rate) of base oils appears to follow the level of impurities (particularly sulfur). Generally, both pure hydrocarbons and base oils tend to charge more when a positive field is applied. Conductivity values help to explain the measured charge levels. This would be expected as conductivity is related to the ionic species (charge carriers) present. The majority of the <b>formulated</b> and commercial <b>oils</b> tested reached charge saturation for all conditions tested, resulting in a normalized value of around 0. 1 pC mm? 1 V? 1, comparable with a theoretical calculated value. The <b>formulated</b> and commercial <b>oils</b> that did not reach saturation have conductivities comparable with base oils and therefore behave in a fashion similar to the base oils...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{effects of}} a TiF 3 {{catalyst}} on the tribological behaviour of carbon black-contaminated liquid paraffin and a fully <b>formulated</b> engine lubricating <b>oil</b> (CD SAE 15 W- 40) were investigated using a four-ball tribological test. Scanning electronic microscopy with energy-dispersive spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, surface roughness, and thermogravimetric analyses were used to investigate the surface element content, chemical valence state, surface roughness, and initial decomposition temperature of the oil samples, respectively. Results showed that the average wear scar diameter (AWSD) and friction coefficient of the two kinds of carbon black-contaminated lubricants decreased {{in the presence of}} 0. 5 wt% TiF 3. The variation rates of the carbon black-contaminated liquid paraffin and fully <b>formulated</b> engine lubricating <b>oil</b> were 29. 45 % and 11. 54 %, respectively, and their initial decomposition temperatures decreased. These phenomena were ascribed to the decomposition of TiF 3 catalyst into TiO 2 and fluoride that resulted in the formation of improved boundary lubrication films. Moreover, for the fully <b>formulated</b> engine <b>oil,</b> the lubrication additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate was catalyzed by TiF 3, decomposing into polyphosphate, which aided the formation of mixture boundary lubrication films...|$|R
40|$|The {{application}} of Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings for automotive components {{is becoming a}} promising strategy {{to cope with the}} new challenges faced by automotive industries. DLC coatings simultaneously provide low friction and excellent wear resistance which could potentially improve fuel economy and durability of the engine components in contact. The mechanisms by which a non-ferrous material interacts with a variety of lubricant additives is becoming better understood as the research effort in this area increases however there are still significant gaps in the understanding. A better understanding of DLC wear may lead to lubricant additive solutions being tailored for DLC surfaces to provide excellent durability (wear) as well as similar or increased fuel economy (low friction). In this work, the wear and friction properties of DLC coating under boundary lubrication conditions have been investigated. A pin-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using HSS steel plates coated with 15 at% hydrogenated DLC (a-C: 15 H) sliding against cast iron pins. One type of fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> with and without ZDDP and two levels of a MoDTC type friction modifier (Mo-FM) was used in this study. The friction and wear response of the fully formulated oils is discussed in detail. Furthermore, Optical Microscope and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) were used to observe the wear scar and obtain wear mechanisms. Energy-Dispersive X-ray analysis (EDX) and X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis were performed on the tribofilms to understand the tribochemical interactions between oil additives and the DLC coating. A nano-indentation study was conducted to observe the changes {{in the structure of the}} coating, which can provide a better insight into the wear mode and failure mechanism of such hard coatings. In the light of the physical observations and tribochemical analysis of the wear scar, the wear behaviour of a hydrogenated DLC (a-C: 15 H) coating was found to depend on the concentration of the MoDTC friction modifier and the wear performance is much better when ZDDP is present in the oil. The tribochemical mechanisms, which contribute to this behaviour, are discussed in this paper...|$|E
40|$|Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) {{coatings}} {{are well}} known for offering excellent tribological properties. They {{have been shown to}} offer low friction and outstanding wear performance in both dry and lubricated conditions. Application of these coatings for automotive components is considered as a promising strategy to cope with the emerging requirements regarding fuel economy and durability. Commercially available oils are generally optimised to work on conventional ferrous surfaces and are not necessarily effective in lubricating non-ferrous surfaces. Recently, the adverse effect of the Molybdenum DialkyldithioCarbamate (MoDTC) friction modifier additive on the wear performance of the hydrogenated DLC has been reported. However, the mechanisms by which MoDTC imposes this high wear to DLC are not yet well understood. A better understanding of DLC wear may potentially lead to better compatibility between DLC surfaces and current additive technology being achieved. In this work, the wear properties of DLC coatings in the DLC/cast iron (CI) system under boundary lubrication conditions have been investigated to try to understand {{what appears to be a}} tribocorrosion-type process. A pin-on-plate tribotester was used to run the experiments using High Speed Steel (HSS) plates coated with 15 at. % hydrogenated DLC (a-C: 15 H) sliding against CI pins or ceramic balls. The lubricants used in this study are typical examples of the same fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> with and without ZDDP. The friction and wear responses of the fully formulated oils are discussed in detail. Furthermore, Optical Microscopy (OM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-Dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), Focused Ion Beam (FIB) and Transmission Electron Microscopy (TEM) were used to observe the wear scar and propose wear mechanisms. The X-ray Photoelectron Spectroscopy (XPS) analysis was performed on the tribofilms to understand the tribochemical interactions between oil additives and the DLC coating. Nano-indentation analysis was conducted to assess potential structural modifications of the DLC coating. Coating hardness data could provide a better insight into the wear mode and failure mechanism of such hard coatings. Given the obtained results, the wear behaviour of the hydrogenated DLC coating was found to depend not only on the presence of ZDDP in the oil formulation but also on the counterpart type. This study revealed that the steel counterpart is a critical component of the tribocouple leading to MoDTC-induced wear of the hydrogenated DLC...|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{economy and}} {{environmental}} protection have become increasingly important {{over the last few}} decades and this has led to the demand for higher efficiency within the automotive sector. Non-ferrous coatings with excellent and unique tribological properties, intended to increase efficiency by lowering friction and wear internally within the car engine are becoming increasingly more prevalent within this sector. Since current lubrication practices are geared towards ferrous materials, it is important to determine the effect that lubricants have on non-traditional coatings. In this study, three Diamond-Like Carbon (DLC) coatings are assessed for their viability within this application, more specifically for the cam-follower interface. The coatings are an amorphous hydrogenated Diamond-Like Carbon and a silicon doped amorphous hydrogenated Diamond-Like Carbon, both produced at the University of Leeds, using a Hauzer Flexicoat 850 deposition system, and a tungsten doped Diamond-Like Carbon coating from Oerlikon Balzers, type Balanit C*. The coatings are characterised to quantify their hardness, thickness, elastic modulus and sp 2 content before being tribologically tested in group III base oil and fully <b>formulated</b> <b>oil</b> containing the anti-wear additive zinc dialkyldithiophosphate on a pin-on-reciprocating plate tribometer. The three DLCs are tested against a cast iron counter-body and analysed for wear and the presence of a phosphate tribo-film. The nature of growth of the tribo-film is commonly known for ferrous contacts but much uncertainty still remains for DLC lubricated contacts. The Hauzer Flexicoat 850 system houses within it two microwave sources which aid in the Plasma Enhanced Chemical Vapour Deposition (PECVD) of DLC. This new technology offers potentially improved coatings for tribological coatings and the ability to tailor the coating for a particular lubricant. In this study the microwave PECVD process is tested to determine its viability within a commercial setting, and to discover the effect of different processing parameters on the mechanical properties of the coatings. The parameters of particular interest are the bias voltage, gas ratio and power of the microwave sources. Preliminary tests were undertaken {{in order to determine the}} optimum position and other fundamental deposition properties before the full scale tests began. This study has shown that a-C:H DLC is the most suitable coating of those tested here for implementation into this application. The Si-DLC and W-DLC were not compatible with the lubricants or the system as will be shown. The lubricant additive ZDDP is important in ferrous systems, and it is shown here to be useful within a DLC environment The microwave DLC coatings have demonstrated good mechanical properties, in particular a high hardness. They have proven to be very promising, and with a substantial reduction in deposition time, demonstrate their potential commercial viability for tribological applications...|$|E
