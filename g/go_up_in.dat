5|$|Fighters Uncaged is a {{fighting}} video {{game for the}} Xbox 360 Kinect system. It was developed by AMA Studios and published by Ubisoft in November 2010. Fighters Uncaged {{was one of the}} first twelve games released for the Kinect. The game has the player control Simon, a man who is attempting to win an illegal fighting tournament to help get his father out of trouble with a crime lord. It has one game mode and features many different fighting moves and different settings and opponents. Simon is able to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> leagues by obtaining certain numbers of points, which in turn unlock more scenarios and opponents. Following its release, Zuffa filed a lawsuit against Ubisoft for the usage of a trademarked term. Fighters Uncaged received poor reviews from critics, with many criticizing the tutorial and visuals, and citing its motion control system as the biggest issue they had with the game, which many considered to be broken.|$|E

The US – an important export country for food stocks – converted approximately 18% of its grain output to ethanol in 2008. Across the US, 25% of the whole corn crop went to ethanol in 2007. The percentage of corn going to biofuel is expected to <b>go</b> <b>up.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, U.S. Senators introduced the BioFuels Security Act.|$|E

25|$|In 1924, the {{architect}} Eliel Saarinen {{was commissioned by}} the AIA of Michigan to compose a waterfront civic center design. However, World War II {{got in the way}} of its development, and it wasn't until the late 1940s that things got under way. The first parts to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> the area were the buildings, including a veteran's hall, an auditorium, and the city-county building.|$|E
25|$|Designed with a ductile steel frame, the {{building}} was to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> record time. Construction commenced in 1974 but was held up for around nine years {{as a result of}} a political standoff between the Muldoon government and the Boilermakers Union. Ongoing strikes and go-slows eventually led to the union’s deregistration and to steel construction going out of favour in New Zealand for many years. The building was eventually completed in 1984 and now stands as a striking landmark on the Wellington CBD skyline.|$|E
25|$|Mr. Dole's {{interests}} changed {{throughout the}} years. He {{laid out a}} half-mile racetrack on his property and purchased the finest horses that money could buy, soon accumulating a string of horses that was the envy of northern Illinois. It is said that Dole loved to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> his tower (currently closed off) and watch his horses run. When tired of the fad of his stable, he disposed of his beautiful and valuable horses by holding an elaborate sale. The Doles lived in the mansion until the late 1890s when the property was sold to his son in law for $1.00.|$|E

25|$|Slave {{characters}} in general {{came to be}} low-comedy types with names that matched the instruments they played: Brudder Tambo (or simply Tambo) for the tambourine and Brudder Bones (or Bones) for the bone castanets or bones. These endmen (for {{their position in the}} minstrel semicircle) were ignorant and poorly spoken, being conned, electrocuted, or run over in various sketches. They happily shared their stupidity; one slave character said that to get to China, one had only to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> a balloon and wait for the world to rotate below. Highly musical and unable to sit still, they constantly contorted their bodies wildly while singing.|$|E
25|$|In 1629, a moment's {{carelessness}} by two workmen caused much of {{the castle}} to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames in the night between the 24 and 25 September. Only the Chapel was spared by {{the strength of its}} arches. King Christian IV put great efforts into restoring the castle. Already in 1631, the work was underway, led by the architect Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger. By 1639 the exterior— which in keeping with the king's wish was reconstructed without major changes— was once again magnificent, but the interior never fully regained its former glory. Furthermore, certain modernizations were made, and portals, chimneypieces, ceiling paintings and other decorations were renewed in Baroque style.|$|E
25|$|Michele Alboreto saw his World Championship dream <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames on lap 13 of the 1985 European Grand Prix at Brands Hatch. After {{stopping}} {{to replace a}} flat-spotted tyre on lap 11, his Ferrari blew its turbo halfway through lap 13. Alboreto, frustrated that Ferrari's late season reliability had cost him the World Championship (he led the points table until Round 11 at Zandvoort) drove the car back to the pits with {{the rear of the}} car on fire. He (dangerously) drove the on-fire car into the pits and straight to his Ferrari pit. Many observers saw this as Alboreto's way of showing that the Ferrari's unreliability had cost him the World Championship, which Prost won by finishing 4th in the race.|$|E

Early schools were shacks at best. A two-room school <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1910, but a larger school was quickly needed. Tahoma High School, a three-story brick building, <b>went</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> 1920. Students {{made up the}} name by {{combining}} the first two letters in the town names Taylor, Hobart and Maple Valley. The school still serves the Tahoma School District as an elementary school.|$|R
25|$|Santos then vacated the WBO {{title to}} <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> weight and pursue the WBO Light Middleweight Championship and Margarito was {{assigned}} to fight Antonio Díaz for the vacant title {{in front of an}} HBO Boxing audience. On March 16, 2002, Margarito crowned himself world champion, beating Diaz by knockout in round ten. He defended that crown with a decision in twelve over Danny Perez Ramírez and a knockout in two over former WBA title holder Andrew Lewis. Lewis was a southpaw and a hard puncher, but had been exposed as having a weak chin, while Margarito proved that he has a world class chin. He publicly asked for a unification bout with then WBC and WBA Champion Ricardo Mayorga.|$|E
25|$|As part of {{an effort}} to crack down on {{corruption}} by the eunuchs inspired by Johnston, Puyi ordered an inventory of the treasures in the Forbidden City, which caused the Hall of Supreme Harmony to <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames in a case of arson on the night of 26 June 1923 as the eunuchs tried to cover up the extent of their theft. Johnston reported on the next day he “found the Emperor and Empress standing on a heap of charred wood, sadly contemplating the spectacle”. The treasures reported lost in the fire include 2,685golden statues of Lord Buddha, 1,675golden altar ornaments, 435porcelain antiques, and 31boxes of sable furs, though it is likely that most if not all of these treasures were sold on the black market before the building was set afire.|$|E
25|$|In August 1932, {{the island}} landing party scene {{and the gas}} bomb scene were filmed south of Los Angeles on a beach at San Pedro, California. All of the native village scenes were then filmed on the RKO-Pathé lot in Culver City with the native huts {{recycled}} from Bird of Paradise (1932). The great wall in the island scenes was a hand-me-down from DeMille's The King of Kings (1927) and dressed up with massive gates, a gong, and primitive carvings. The scene of Ann being led through the gates to the sacrificial altar was filmed at night with hundreds of extras and 350 lights for illumination. A camera was mounted on a crane to follow Ann to the altar. The Culver City Fire Department was on hand due to concerns that the set might <b>go</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> flames from the many native torches used in the scene. The wall and gate were destroyed in 1939 for Gone With the Winds burning of Atlanta sequence. Hundreds of extras were once again used for Kong's rampage through the native village, and filming was completed with individual vignettes of mayhem and native panic.|$|E

[...] Stone said that [...] "Todd was this close to being offed, but Howarth made that choice laughable. Rampaging through fictional Llanview, he injected ambiguity into the bluntest dialogue, his sneers averting cynicism to reveal depression and humor" [...] and [...] "transformed Todd into a soul-wrenched Lucifer, his rage ripped from abuse and bathed in vengeful glee, his sexiness rising off his instinct for survival and his outlaw impulse to disrupt." [...] She added, [...] "Even the ragged scar he acquired on one cheek only heightened his animal appeal. No soap would jettison such gold and electricity—a figure simultaneously furious, ironic, melancholy, and horny." ...|$|E

Time called the pavilion [...] "dynamic" [...] and recommended it as one of two must-see attractions in the park, while one New York Times writer found herself standing [...] "agog" [...] at what appeared to her to be a [...] "celestial gateway to another universe" [...] and a frame for the sky. Lonely Planet travel guide called the pavilion the anchor of the park, and the 2004 Year in Review issue of Time described it as the park's crown jewel.
