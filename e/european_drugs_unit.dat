The report warns, however, that an increase in production {{in most of the}} countries supplying Europe with heroin could result in more of the drug becoming available in <b>European</b> <b>drug</b> markets. Other changes in market dynamics, including processing of heroin inside Europe, the emergence of alternative trafficking routes and diversification of products from opioid-producing countries in Asia, need to be monitored carefully. As the age profile of heroin users increases, providing appropriate treatment and care to long-term users is a growing challenge for drug treatment and social services. Cannabis continues to dominate reports on all drug law offences. Around 80...|$|R
40|$|The <b>European</b> Union <b>Drug</b> Strategy for {{the period}} 2009 – 12 sets the goal to yield {{concrete}} and identifiable improvements concerning the knowledge of drugs trafficking. In addition, the EU Drugs Action Plan for 2009 – 12 defines among others the objectives to develop key-indicators of policy-relevant data on drug markets, {{as well as a}} strategy to collect them. This Pilot study on wholesale drug markets aims to contribute to this process, starting by discussing the utility of collecting wholesale drug prices in Europe. In order to assess the feasibility of this collection process, this study provides an overview of the procedures implemented nationally and of the information available in European countries on wholesale drug prices.

40|$|Background: The current <b>European</b> <b>Drug</b> Strategy (EDS) and {{attendant}} Action Plan {{come to an}} {{end this}} year signalling a period of evaluation of and reflection on whether they have achieved their aims and objectives. Methodology: This opinion based article seeks to add a critical and academic evaluation to the mix, which is focused on determining {{the extent to which the}} <b>European</b> <b>drug</b> policy has brought added value to drug policy that is formulated at the national level, in accordance with the principle of subsidiarity. The analysis presented here examines the five key areas defined by the EDS: coordination, demand reduction, supply reduction, international cooperation and information, research and evaluation. Results: It suggests that, while clear benefits have been brought in the realm of information, research and evaluation and the development of harm reduction measures, there is still significant progress yet to be made. Conclusion: It finds that neither the Commission's dedication to increasing focus on law-enforcement methods, nor the Council's prescription for 'more of the same' are particularly beneficial to the development of <b>European</b> <b>drug</b> policy. Instead, the priorities should be building on areas where added value has been engendered and on allowing diversity in policy to flourish...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: In {{a recent}} article in the pages of this journal, the author {{outlined}} the hypothesis that, although there have been recent evolutions in European governance effected by the Lisbon treaty, these changes have not brought about any convergence in the national <b>drug</b> policies of <b>European</b> member states. The original article focused on developments in the national drug policies of key member states and based the assessment on their maintenance of key, and significantly different, national policy aims. Standring, in this edition, has offered a critique of that article suggesting that the author has been overly pessimistic in her {{understanding of the nature of}} drug policy integration at the European level and that soft integration tools have allowed a high degree of policy convergence in this controversial area. This paper aims to strengthen and confirm the author's position by examining the tools of <b>European</b> <b>drug</b> policy integration. Design/methodology/approach: Key policy strategies (for example, the <b>European</b> <b>Drug</b> Strategy and Action Plans, European level anti-drug trafficking frameworks and recent implementations on newly developed psychoactive substances at the European level) are examined here for indications of success or otherwise in the harmonisation (or convergence) of <b>European</b> national <b>drug</b> policies. Findings: Ultimately, even under these new terms of reference, the paper finds that attempts to either harmonise or converge <b>European</b> national <b>drug</b> policies have done little more than scratch the surface. Originality/value: The paper suggests that neither the top-down regulation, here described, nor the soft convergence that Standring envisages are desirable for <b>European</b> <b>drug</b> policy making where they are implemented with the aim of making national drug policies more similar...|$|R

The findings indicate that county-level agencies, those with other formalized drug control efforts, high levels of violent crime, high degrees of task specialization and formalization, and high proportions of the resident population accounted for by renters {{were more likely to}} operate <b>drug</b> <b>units,</b> participate in multi-agency drug task forces, and allocate more officers per capita to these efforts...|$|R
