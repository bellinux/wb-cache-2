25|$|Chuck's {{philosophy}} was to convince <b>every</b> <b>guy</b> {{on the team}} that his role was important. If you came in {{as a free agent}} and were just a gunner on the punt team or the third safety, you were doing something the team needed to win...It was his way of emphasizing that no one is irreplaceable. You have to coach everybody the same way. If Joe Greene goes out, Steve Furness goes in and we're not going to change anything. Chuck never panicked when someone got hurt or held out. We can still function. That made a big impression on me.|$|E
500|$|Durant {{entered the}} 2009 {{season as the}} club's {{starting}} quarterback, but head coach Ken Miller gave backup Jyles significant playing time as well. Durant {{made the most of}} his opportunity, becoming the first Roughrider quarterback to start all 18 games since Kent Austin, who last played for the club in 1993. Durant's consistency on the field {{was one of the reasons}} he earned the Roughriders' starting quarterback position, along with his ability to run for yards when his pass protection breaks down. Durant was named the Roughriders nominee for CFL Most Outstanding Player, and was selected a West Division All-Star at quarterback. He was also named the Roughriders' Wireless Age Most Popular Player. Durant led the Roughriders to the Grey Cup, where they were defeated by the Montreal Alouettes on a last second field goal. He finished the 2009 season with 4,348 passing yards and 501 rushing yards. Durant threw 24 touchdown passes during the season and also had 21 interceptions, leading the CFL. Heading into the 2010 season, Durant wanted to cut down on his interceptions, although he tried to be optimistic, [...] "I throw 21 picks last year and I guarantee <b>every</b> <b>guy</b> with better stats than me wishes they were in the Grey Cup." ...|$|E

5000|$|Writer/director Don Coscarelli {{wrote the}} {{character}} for Reggie Bannister and based {{it on their}} friendship. They then pushed the character into new directions, divergent from Bannister's personality. Bannister describes the character as an everyman. [...] According to Coscarelli, everyman characters like Reggie are important, because they ground the film and allow humor to unfold. [...] Bannister further described the character as written to be extremely loyal; Bannister says that Coscarelli [...] "wrote this character to be <b>every</b> <b>guy's</b> <b>guy,</b> <b>every</b> man's friend, the guy that would throw himself on the flames {{to the door of}} hell to save a friend." [...] The character was named after Bannister himself, as Coscarelli liked to draw characters from his own experiences. Instead of struggling to find a unique name, Coscarelli named him after the inspiration. [...] Bannister had much input into the character's portrayal, and Coscarelli frequently sought his opinion. [...] Bannister was influenced by the comedy of Harold Lloyd and Charlie Chaplin; he states that Reggie is [...] "a humorless character" [...] who, like the characters of Lloyd and Chaplin, does not recognize the humor of his situations. [...] Nate Yapp describes the character as rising in prominence from a third lead to main protagonist. [...] Bannister states that the character starts as a simple ice cream vendor and progresses into an action hero, and his rise to series protagonist turns him into the Tall Man's nemesis. [...] While working as a musician, Bannister was drafted during the Vietnam War, and he used this experience to guide his characterization of an ice cream vendor forced to confront evil.|$|R
