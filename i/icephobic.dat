50|$|It was {{suggested}} in 2012 that superhydrophobic surfaces capable of repelling water {{can also be}} used to prevent ice accumulation leading to icephobicity. However, not every superhydrophobic surface is <b>icephobic</b> and the method is still under development.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} {{minimize}} ice accretion on the various surfaces of the aircraft, researchers have {{during the course of}} history sought to find <b>icephobic</b> materials for usage in aeronautical applications. Examples of such materials are carbon nanotubes [...] and slippery liquid infused porous surfaces (SLIPS).|$|E
5000|$|The term [...] "icephobicity" [...] {{is similar}} to the term {{hydrophobicity}} and other “-phobicities” in physical chemistry (oleophobicity, lipophobicity, omniphobicity, amphiphobicity, etc.). The icephobicity is different from deicing and anti-icing in that <b>icephobic</b> surfaces, unlike the anti-icing surfaces, do not require special treatment or chemical coatings to prevent ice formation, ...|$|E
50|$|In recent {{publications}} on {{the subject}} there are three approaches to the characterization of surface icephobicity. First, the icephobicity implies low adhesion force between ice and the solid surface. In most cases, the critical shear stress is calculated, although the normal stress {{can be used as}} well. While no explicit quantitative definition for the icephobicty has been suggested so far, the researchers characterized <b>icephobic</b> surfaces as those having the shear strength (maximum stress) less in the region between 150 kPa and 500 kPa and even as low as 15.6 kPa,.|$|E
50|$|These three {{definitions}} {{imply that}} <b>icephobic</b> surfaces should (i) prevent freezing of water condensing {{on the surface}} (ii) prevent freezing of incoming water (iii) if ice formed, it should have weak adhesion strength with the solid, {{so that it can}} be easily removed. Anti-icing properties may depend on such circumstances as whether the solid surface is colder than the air/vapor, how big is the temperature gradient, and whether a thin film of water tends to form on the solid surface due to capillary effects, disjoining pressure, etc. Mechanical properties of ice and the substrate also of great importance since ice shedding occurs as fracture, either in the Mode I (normal) or Mode II (shear) cracking, so that crack concentrators are major contributors to the reduced strength,.|$|E
50|$|Note that {{thermodynamically}} {{both the}} hydrophobic interactions and ice formation {{are driven by}} the minimization of the surface Gibbs energy, ΔG = ΔH − TΔS, where H, T, and S are the enthalpy, temperature, and entropy, respectively. This is because in the hydrophobic interactions large positive value of TΔS prevails over a small positive value of ΔH making spontaneous hydrophobic interaction energetically profitable. The so-called surface roughening transition governs the direction of ice crystal growth and occurs at the critical temperature, above which the entropic contribution into the Gibbs energy, TΔS, prevails over the enthalpic contribution, ΔH, thus making it more energetically profitable for the ice crystal to be rough rather than smooth. This suggests that thermodynamically both the <b>icephobic</b> and hydrophobic behaviors {{can be viewed as}} entropic effects.|$|E
5000|$|It {{has been}} also {{suggested}} that the superhydrophobic surfaces can also repel ice or prevent ice accumulation leading to the phenomenon of icephobicity. However, not every superhydrophobic surface is <b>icephobic</b> [...] and the approach is still under development [...] In particular, the frost formation over the entire surface is inevitable {{as a result of}} undesired inter-droplet freezing wave propagation initiated by the sample edges. Moreover, the frost formation directly results in an increased frost adhesion, posing severe challenges for the subsequent defrosting process. By creating hierarchical surface, the interdroplet freezing wave propagation can be suppressed whereas the ice/frost removal can be promoted. The enhanced performances are mainly owing to the activation of the microscale edge effect in the hierarchical surface, which increases the energy barrier for ice bridging as well as engendering the liquid lubrication during the deicing/defrosting process.|$|E

Although superhydrophobic surfaces are not always <b>icephobic,</b> the theoretical mechanisms behind icephobicity {{are similar to the}} entropically driven hydrophobic interactions. The growth of ice crystals in saturated vapor is partially governed by entropically driven diffusion of water molecules to definite locations similarly to hydrophobic interactions.

To investigate the <b>icephobic</b> properties of different coatings, ice adhesion measurements were performed with a 0 ° cone test to determine ice adhesion strengths between coating and ice. Various coatings with different <b>icephobic</b> properties were investigated, e. g., hydrophilic and hydrophobic coatings, sol–gel based coatings containing fluorinated compounds and viscoelastic rubbers, as well as commercially available <b>icephobic</b> products. The coatings currently used on {{wind turbines}} showed an adhesion to ice that is comparable to that of bare aluminium; meaning a quite high adhesion to ice. Very low adhesion values were obtained in the case of coatings consisting of viscoelastic elastomers. Additionally, the influence of surface roughness on ice adhesion has been examined. Aluminium pins were chemically and mechanically roughened and their ice adhesion was determined. These pins were further coated with a fluorine-containing coating in order to study the influence of minimized surface energies. Shear stress of those coated pins was considerably reduced, however, rough surfaces showed higher ice adhesion than smooth ones...|$|E
40|$|Using both {{artificial}} {{and natural}} templates, biomimetic micro-structures {{are fabricated on}} conventional coating materials (epoxy and silicone elastomers) to mimic both artificial and natural templates through effective pattern transfer processes. The pattern transfer processes use a soft-polymer negative stamp, where {{the flexibility of the}} stamp allows for easy conformation to both flat and curved surfaces. Patterns have been successfully transferred as a rigid epoxy to complex surfaces or as a soft elastomer replica of a hydrophobic Trembling Aspen leaf. The hydrophobicity and friction behaviour of the resulting micro-patterned surfaces are systematically investigated, showing that surface patterning can be used as an effective way to improve hydrophobicity while reducing the surface adhesion and friction without a loss of the structural integrity or rigidity typical of epoxy coatings. The relative strength of the micro-pattern was determined through indentation testing in order to support the claim of a robust pattern on the micro-scale that is able to withstand the harsh environment of industrial application or weather exposure. With the well characterized patterned epoxy material fabricated and able to be transferred to many different surfaces, the potential for the patterned surface to act as an <b>icephobic</b> coating was pursued. The robustness of the epoxy material with the unique ability to coat surfaces that are typically unable to possess a micro-structure makes this coating an ideal candidate for large-scale <b>icephobic</b> application. The potential use of a micro-patterned epoxy coating is investigated against comparable surface coatings within an innovative experimental set-up to measure the relative ice-adhesion strength of different substrates. In characterizing the relative shear-force required to remove frozen water droplets from the coating surface at the interface, several variables and factors were explored. The addition of a surface pattern was found to impact the <b>icephobic</b> ability of several materials, where different materials with the same pattern were compared to identify that the surface energy of the substrate influences the <b>icephobic</b> nature of a surface. Moreover, previous studies that relate the water contact angle or hysteresis to ice-adhesion strength are questioned through a preliminary qualitative analysis of ice adhesion strength data.

Ideally, an <b>icephobic</b> material should be the least expensive anti-icing solution, inasmuch as the anti-icing effect is not destroyed by inclement environmental conditions.

In the first step, ice adhesion was measured in Centrifuge Adhesion Tests (CAT) on eight promising coatings. The ice adhesion τadh of the candidate coatings was found to vary from 0. 001 MPa to 0. 16 MPa. In the second step, in order to analyze ice accretion and ice shedding, four favorable coatings were evaluated in a wind tunnel on scaled-down rotor (SRB) set-ups, which were iced and rotated until shedding occurred.

The first method, the ice Centrifuge Adhesion Test (CAT), measures the force required to separate the accreted ice from the coating (e. g. adhesive failure). The test involves simultaneously icing, under supercooled precipitation, the extremity of bare reference and freshly coated aluminum samples. The ice adhesion shear stress is calculated from the ice detachment rotation speed. The results are reported as Adhesion Reduction Factor (ARF), which is the ice adhesion stress on the bare aluminum reference samples divided by the ice adhesion stress on the coated samples. The second method is the Static ice Accumulation Test (SAT), by which the amount of ice accumulated on coated substrates set up at incidence angles of 45 ° and 80 ° is compared to uncoated Al surfaces inclined at the same angles. The results are reported in terms of Accumulation Reduction Factor (ACCRF), which is the ice mass on the bare aluminum samples divided by that accumulated on the coated samples. Overall, the performance of tested coatings over the years remains similar {{with a wide range}} of ARF values, 0. 5 to 1000, corresponding to stresses between 0. 8 MPa and 0. 0005 MPa, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Adhesion of ice to {{surfaces}} creates {{problems for}} many industries, including hydropower and navigation. At present, ice removal techniques are costly, hazardous, and time-consuming. Andersson and Andersson (1992) reported that one hydro-power station in Sweden had ice-related costs averaging $ 0. 2 {{million per year}} over a 10 -year period. Annual maintenance costs incurred at Corps of Engineer projects {{as a result of}} ice problems were estimated to be $ 33 million in 1992 (Haynes et al. 1993). Numerous commercially available materials, coatings, and paints are advertised to have low friction or non-stick properties. Some of these coatings are also marketed as <b>icephobic</b> (i. e., significantly lowering the adhesion strength of ice). We have measured the ice adhesion strength for many of these coatings and materials in the laboratory to rank their relative performance (e. g., Haehnel and Mulherin 1998). Our most recent study focused on the suitability of these materials and coatings for controlling icing at hydraulic structures. We measured the ice adhesion strength of common paints used by the Corps of Engineers to protect steel members on hydraulic structures and compared their performance to the low-adhesion coatings. Both vinyl-based paints (used at fresh-water projects) and epoxy paints (mainly salt/brackish water applications) were evaluated. Because the paints used by the Corps have been primarily developed for their high durability, it was considered unlikely that the low-adhesion coatings would replace them, but, instead, would be applied over the Corps paints to reduce ice adhesion to the surface.

40|$|The {{accretion}} of ice on {{the surfaces}} of power network systems, aircraft, communication networks, etc., is known to cause serious problems that often lead to costly safety issues. An ideal solution would be to prevent ice from accumulating in the first place, rather than waiting for ice to accrete and then to de-ice which is both time-consuming and expensive. This may be accomplished by depositing coating materials that are <b>icephobic.</b> A low dielectric constant surface is expected to reduce the adhesion of ice due to the screening of mirror charges, thereby eliminating {{one of the strongest}} interaction forces—the electrostatic force of attraction—at the ice–surface interface. Superhydrophobic surfaces, which demonstrate high water-repellency due to the negligible contact area of water with these surfaces, are also expected to minimize the contact area of ice. In the present research work, both concepts were studied by producing superhydrophobic nanorough low-ε (dielectric) surfaces on aluminum. Superhydrophobic properties were achieved on surfaces of aluminum by creating a certain nanoroughness using a chemical etch followed by ‘passivation’ of the surface by a low surface energy coating of rf-sputtered Teflon, providing a water contact angle greater than 160 ◦. The same behavior is reported even when the nanorough substrates were coated with dielectric thin films of ZnO (lower ε) or TiO 2 (higher ε) prior to passivation. It is found that the superhydrophobic nanorough low energy surfaces are also <b>icephobic</b> and the presence of a low dielectric constant surface coating of Teflon (ε = 2) allows a considerable reduction of the ice adhesion strength.

40|$|Ice {{accumulation}} {{is a human}} {{safety risk}} and a cause of important material damages in maritime, ground and air transportation, on ground and maritime energy exploitation and in telecommunication and electric networks. Many ice protection systems {{have been developed to}} prevent ice formation, but they are expensive to use due to their energy consumption. Passive systems, such as <b>icephobic</b> coatings applied on exposed surfaces, appear to be an interesting solution to prevent ice accumulation by reducing its adherence; but coating icephobicity is difficult to quantify. To measure icephobicity, the Anti-icing Material International Laboratory (AMIL) developed the Centrifuge Adhesion Test (CAT) in 2006. The test involves icing the extremity of small beams under freezing drizzle in a climatic chamber. Following icing, the beams are balanced in a centrifuge and rotated at an accelerating speed until the ice detaches and the corresponding rotation speed is measured. The adhesion shear stress is calculated from the centrifugal force evaluated at the detachment rotation speed, and the ice contact surface. The results are then reported as an Adhesion Reduction Factor (ARF) which is the ratio of the adhesion shear stress of the beams with a candidate coating with respect to uncoated beams. The higher the ARF, the more <b>icephobic</b> the coating; values below one indicate an increase in adhesion. For coatings with high icephobicity, the CAT apparatus sensitivity proved to be insufficient to evaluate the ARF. To remedy this, in 2009, AMIL modified the CAT apparatus to increase its sensitivity. The new CAT, called CAT-NG, can measure ARF in a range of 0. 6 to 1 000 inexpensively and timely. To ensure reliable ARF factor with confidence level of 95 %, the beam area exposed to icing is polished after 5 tests, or every month, to reduce the ice erosion effect on aluminum surface.

Here we carried out an experimental study to explore the relationships between low ice adhesion strength and room temperature surface properties. A variety of room temperature properties of 22 polymer-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic samples consisting of both low and high ice adhesion surfaces were analysed. The properties investigated include water adhesion force, water wettability, roughness, elastic modulus and hardness. Our results show that low ice adhesion strength does not correlate well with water contact angle and its variants, surface roughness and hardness. Low elastic modulus does not guarantee low ice adhesion, however, surfaces with low ice adhesion always show low elastic modulus. Low ice adhesion (below 60 kPa) of tested surfaces may be determinative of small water adhesion force (from 180 to 270 [*]μN).

Here we discuss key aspects and findings related to the physics of ice formation on surfaces and show how such knowledge could be employed to rationally develop surfaces with extreme resistance to icing (extraordinary icephobicity). Although superhydrophobic surfaces with micro-, nano-, or (often biomimetic) hierarchical roughnesses have shown in laboratory settings (under certain conditions) excellent repellency and low adhesion to water down to temperatures near or below the freezing point, extreme icephobicity necessitates additional important functionalities. Other approaches, such as lubricant-impregnated surfaces, exhibit both advantages and serious limitations with respect to icing. In all, a clear path toward passive surfaces with extreme resistance to ice formation remains a challenge, {{but it is one}} well worth undertaking. Equally important to potential applications is scalable surface manufacturing and the ability of <b>icephobic</b> surfaces to perform reliably and sustainably outside the laboratory under adverse conditions. Surfaces should possess mechanical and chemical stability, and they should be thermally resilient. Such issues and related research directions are also addressed in this article. 1...|$|E
40|$|This {{paper is}} in closed access until 8 th Dec 2018. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd Ice {{accretion}} and accumulation pose serious challenges {{for maintaining the}} operation and performance of outdoor facilities in cold climate. Epoxy resin, {{with a wide range}} of formulation possibilities, is widely used as protective coatings for outdoor facilities. However, bisphenol A (BPA), a key ingredient of conventional epoxy, is known to interfere with human's natural hormones and cause various disorders in the body system. Reduction or complete elimination of the usage of BPA is therefore high in the agenda of the coatings industries. In this study, a transparent, anti-icing, bio-based ep oxy coating was developed for room-temperature processing. As a result of hydrophobic treatment with addition of silanes, the glass-transition temperature and anti-icing performance of bio-based epoxy resin increased significantly. The optimum coating exhibited good water repellency and ice-adhesion strength as low as 50 kPa at − 20 °, which was half of the widely accepted threshold value of 100 kPa for <b>icephobic</b> coatings. The icing delay time was much delayed compared with that of an uncoated glass substrate. To further demonstrate the anti-icing performance of the optimized coating, supercooled-water dripping on coated wooden outdoor floors and wooded boards was conducted at − 15 °C, superior anti-icing performance was observed on the coated substrates...|$|E
40|$|The global {{photovoltaic}} {{industry is}} a rapidly growing and highly competitive, innovation-based sector. Norway s interest in photovoltaics has been behind other countries for a long time; however a recent impulse in the solar industry has developed, driven by the necessity of reducing buildings impact on environment. As {{a matter of fact}} Norwegian interest in photovoltaics leads {{to the study of the}} influence of snow on PV devices. As a consequence, different studies have been conducted to find an adequate solution to the problem. First of all the snow condition is described through statistical data and graphs in the most populated cities of Norway: Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim. In addition the will of Norwegian industry and research to address to renewable resources is underlined. As a consequence, the motivation and the interest in this thesis topic appear clear. The second part of the thesis gives some guidelines about the geometric design of a PV-plant taking in consideration the accumulation of snow on the panels. Different answers are given for different plan conditions. When the modules are all located on the same shed, a high tilt angle can be more convenient than a low one, because it increases the sliding of snow. On the contrary, when panels are located on different sheds, the shading problems leads to the conclusion that a medium tilt angle is the best solution. Other indications are given regarding the division of the system electrically, through string diodes and module by-pass diodes. In conclusion this part is addresses to who is approaching in designing a new PV-plant. The third part focuses on computation of snow loss; therefore it is applicable to existing PV systems. An application of Marion s algorithm and the PVsyst software on the ZEB Living Lab PV-plant supposed in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim gives interesting results about the snow loss values. They are strongly related to the snow depth, solar radiation and air temperature, therefore a deep connection to the location weather data is present. The monthly snow loss percentage reaches values till 70 % in Oslo, while lower percentages characterize the other sites. However the annual loss is around 3 % in Oslo and Trondheim and around 1 % in Bergen. Possible solutions to avoid or reduce snow accumulation on the PV panels are investigated in the fourth chapter. Then a focus on the <b>icephobic</b> coatings was presented. Their characteristics, their design, their properties were studied to know how useful these elements can be to our case. Finally a spotlight on the state-of-art showed the possibilities that are nowadays offered by the market. The fifth chapter copes with a hypothesis of simulation of <b>icephobic</b> coatings on the PV modules, to have an idea of their contribute in term of energy save. Moreover the fact that soiling loss is reduced as well should be taken in consideration. The simulations were conducted for the same PV-plant supposed in Oslo, Bergen and Trondheim in the third part, so that differences between the two cases were highlighted...|$|E
