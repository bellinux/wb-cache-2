25|$|Fishing {{techniques}} may {{be altered}} to minimize bycatch and reduce impacts on marine habitats. These techniques include using varied <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> depending on target species and habitat type. For example, a net with larger holes will allow undersized fish to avoid capture.

Avoiding fishing in spawning grounds may allow fish stocks to rebuild by giving adults a chance to reproduce.|$|E
25|$|The {{early history}} of the {{recreational}} blue crab fishery in the Gulf of Mexico is not well known. Commercial crabbing was first reported in the Gulf of Mexico in the 1880s. Early crab fishermen used long-handled dip nets and drop nets among other simple fishing <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> to trap crabs at night. Blue crab spoiled quickly, which limited distribution and hindered {{the growth of the}} fishery for several decades. The first commercial processing plant in Louisiana opened in Morgan City in 1924. Other plants opened soon after, although commercial processing of hard blue crabs was not widespread until World War II.|$|E
25|$|Many {{types of}} gear {{have been used}} to catch blue crabs along the Atlantic and Gulf Coasts. Initially people used very simple {{techniques}} and gear, which included hand lines, dip nets, and push nets among a variety of other <b>gear</b> <b>types.</b> The trotline, a long baited twine set in waters 5–15 feet deep, was the first major gear type used commercially to target hard crabs. Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Motorcycle is invented so {{far more}} than 100 years. Because of having the {{advantages}} of light weight, cheap and fast-moving, motorcycle becomes the most popular traffic vehicle. Traditionally, the power systems of motorcycles are internal combustion engines. Recently, due to the reason of energy-saving, and carbon reduction, the engine in motorcycle is substituted by electric motor. Hence, due to the reason of pollution-free, electric motorcycle {{become more and more}} popular in city traffic. Planetary gear trains can be used as the transmission systems for electric motorcycles. The purpose of this work is to do the kinematic design of three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions for electric motorcycles. First, according to the train value equation of planetary gear train, The reduction ratio equations of planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions can be derived. Then, based on these reduction ratio equations, the kinematic design of three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmission is accomplished. Based on the proposed methodology, all three-speed planetary <b>gear</b> <b>type</b> automatic transmissions can be synthesized...|$|R

500|$|The western North Atlantic {{porbeagle}} {{population has}} a more positive prospect than in the eastern North Atlantic. Fishing in Canadian waters was originally regulated by the 1995 Fisheries Management Plan for pelagic sharks in Atlantic Canada, which established an annual quota of 1,500 tons, restricted the time, place, and <b>gear</b> <b>types</b> allowed for commercial fishing, and set limits for bycatch and recreational fishing. In 2000–2001, Fisheries and Oceans Canada (DFO) prepared a detailed population model and concluded that a quota of 200–250 tons would allow for population growth, resulting in a quota of 250 tons being adopted {{for the period of}} 2002–2007. The mating ground off of Newfoundland was also closed to shark fishing. [...] In 2004, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada (COSEWIC) listed the porbeagle as Endangered, largely {{on the basis of the}} low population abundance (<25% of original numbers). Canada decided not to list the species under its Species At Risk Act, but further reduced the total fishing quota to 185 tons. [...] In US waters, the 1993 Fishery Management Plan for Sharks of the Atlantic Ocean sets an annual quota of 92 tons (post-processing) for the porbeagle. In 2006, this species was listed as a Species of Concern by the National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS), meaning that it merits conservation concern but there is insufficient data for inclusion on the US Endangered Species Act.|$|E

50|$|Until the {{beginning}} of the 1960s, tractors had a single register of gears, hence one gear stick, often with three to five forward gears and 1 reverse. Then, group gears were introduced, and another gear stick was added. Later, control of the forward-reverse direction was moved to a special stick attached {{at the side of the}} steering wheel, which allowed forward or reverse travel in any gear. Nowadays, with CVTs or other clutch-free <b>gear</b> <b>types,</b> fewer sticks control the transmission, and some are replaced with electrical switches or are totally computer-controlled.|$|E
