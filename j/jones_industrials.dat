50|$|The Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&I) {{was a large}} steel concentration. By 1903, it {{was largely}} owned and {{controlled}} by John D. Rockefeller and Jay Gould's financial heirs. While it came to control many plants throughout the country, its main plant was a steel mill {{on the south side}} of Pueblo, Colorado and was the city's main industry for most of its history. From 1901 to 1912, Colorado Fuel and Iron was one of the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials.</b> The steel-market crash of 1982 lead to the decline of the company. After going through several bankruptcies, the company was acquired by Oregon Steel Mills in 1993, and changed its name to Rocky Mountain Steel Mills. In January 2007, along with the rest of Oregon Steel's holdings, was acquired by Evraz Group, a Russian steel corporation, for $2.3 billion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{features}} {{an analysis of}} the relationship between the DOW <b>JONES</b> <b>Industrial</b> Average Index (DJIA) and a sentiment news series using daily data obtained from the Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) 1 provided by SIRCA (The Securities Industry Research Centre of the Asia Pacic). The recent growth in the availability of on-line financial news sources such as internet news and social media sources provides instantaneous access to financial news. Various commercial agencies have started developing their own filtered financial news feeds which are used by investors and traders to support their algorithmic trading strategies. Thomson Reuters News Analytics (TRNA) 2 is one such data set. In this study we use the TRNA data set to construct a series of daily sentiment scores for Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) stock index component companies. We use these daily DJIA market sentiment scores to study the relationship between financial news sentiment scores and the stock prices of these companies using entropy measures. The entropy and Mutual Information (MI) statistics permit {{an analysis of the}} amount of information within the sentiment series, its relationship to the DJIA and an indication of how the relationship changes over time...|$|R
5000|$|The {{crash on}} October 19, 1987, a date {{that is also}} known as Black Monday, was the climactic {{culmination}} of a market decline that had begun five days before on October 14. The DJIA fell 3.81 percent on October 14, followed by another 4.60 percent drop on Friday, October 16. On Black Monday, the Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials</b> Average plummeted 508 points, losing 22.6% of its value in one day. The S&P 500 dropped 20.4%, falling from 282.7 to 225.06. The NASDAQ Composite lost only 11.3%, not because of restraint on the part of sellers, but because the NASDAQ market system failed. Deluged with sell orders, many stocks on the NYSE faced trading halts and delays. Of the 2,257 NYSE-listed stocks, there were 195 trading delays and halts during the day. The NASDAQ market fared much worse. Because of its reliance on a [...] "market making" [...] system that allowed market makers to withdraw from trading, liquidity in NASDAQ stocks dried up. Trading in many stocks encountered a pathological condition where the bid price for a stock exceeded the ask price. These [...] "locked" [...] conditions severely curtailed trading. On October 19, trading in Microsoft shares on the NASDAQ lasted a total of 54 minutes.|$|E
5000|$|On September 5, 2008, the United States Department of Labor {{issued a}} report that its {{unemployment}} rate rose to 6.1%, the highest in five years and the Congressional Budget Office forecast that the unemployment rate could reach as high as 9% during 2010. The news report cited Department of Labor reports and interviewed Jared Bernstein, an economist:The unemployment rate jumped to 6.1 percent in August, its highest level in five years, as {{the erosion of the}} job market accelerated over the summer. Employers cut 84,000 jobs last month, more than economists had expected, and the Labor Department said that more jobs were lost in June and July than previously thought. So far, 605,000 jobs have disappeared since January. The unemployment rate, which rose from 5.7 percent in July, is now at its highest level since September 2003. Jared Bernstein, economist at the Economics Policy Institute in Washington, said eight months of consecutive job losses had historically signaled that the economy was in a recession. [...] "If anyone is still scratching their head over that one, they can stop," [...] Mr. Bernstein said.

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model for the {{estimation}} of time series returns of illiquid asset portfolios. The model has four major advantages. First, the estimators are arithmetic averages of individual asset returns (or their proxies), so they strictly correspond to the portfolio returns. Second, the model is able to estimate returns of arbitrary-weighted portfolios, including equalweighted, price-weighted, and value-weighted portfolios. Third, the model is very general and accommodates methods proposed in previous research. Fourth, the model is able to use both price data and data of asset characteristics to improve efficiency of estimators. It is also able to correct for the sample bias problem that transactions may take place more likely on over-valued assets. Simulations with actual data of Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials</b> show that this model supplies superior estimators than a simple benchmark method...|$|E

Our conclusion validates the use of prediction techniques in those stock markets. It’s remarkable the result of the Hurst Coefficient Technique, that in average was of 0, 75 for the indexes of this study which would justify the use of ARFIMA models among others for the prediction of such series. ...|$|E

40|$|Prompted by the {{inflation}}-adjusted Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials</b> Average setting {{its first}} record high in {{almost thirty years}} in 1995, this paper studies the impact of inflation on nominal and real stock prices from a theoretical, historical, and empirical perspective. While stocks are an excellent longterm hedge against inflation, nominal stock prices stagnate and real stock prices fall {{during a period of}} rapid inflation. Both nominal and real stockprices then go through a catch-up phase during the subsequent disinflation period. The history for this century is consistent with this pattern. Regression analysis between real and nominal stock prices as the dependent variables and inflation as the independent variable shows statistically significant evidence that (a) nominal stock returns are positively related to inflation while real stock returns are not; and (b) both nominal and real stock returns are negatively related to accelerations of inflation and positively related to decelerations...|$|E
40|$|Motivated by the {{empirical}} findings that asset returns or volatilities are predictable, this paper studies the pricing of European options {{on the stock}} or volatility, the instantaneous changes of which depend upon an autoregressive moving average (ARMA) process. An ARMA(p, q) process is transformed to an MA(n) process with new MA orders, called n, depended on observed time span under risk-neutral probability measure. The pricing formula of ARMA-type option {{is similar to that}} of Black and Scholes except for the volatility depended upon the AR and MA parameters. Based on the result of numerical analyses, the option values are increasing function of the level of AR or MA parameters for all moneyness level. Specifically, the AR effect is more significant than the MA effect. 2 Introduction There is now a substantial body of evidence that documents the predictability of financial asset returns. For example, Fama (1965) finds that the first-order autocorrelations of daily returns are positive for 23 of the 30 Dow <b>Jones</b> <b>Industrials.</b> Fisher (1966) suggests that the autocorrelations of monthly returns on diversified portfolios are positive and larger than those for individual stocks.
