40|$|Neck pain is {{a common}} {{musculoskeletal}} complaint in Norway and globally causing a huge economic burden in many countries. Research on possible underlying mechanisms of the chronicity of neck pain are important to develop effective treatments based on objective findings. There is increasing amount of evidence that links the neck flexor muscle endurance with neck pain and motor control problems of the neck. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the relationship between head steadiness in terms of head motion velocity and endurance of neck muscles in a chronic neck pain group. A three dimensional electromagnetic system was used to measure the position and movements of the head. The head steadiness and time to exhaustion were measured in a cross-sectional studyduring a high- and low load isometric neck flexion tests in 21 healthy individuals with no neck pain and 15 individuals with chronic neck painT-test and Mann-Whitney test were used to analyze the mean differences between the groups. The results showed a decreased head steadiness in the low load test and decrased time to exhaustion in the neck pain group in the <b>high</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> compared to healthy controls. Head steadiness in the <b>high</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> did not show any group difference. The results must be interpreted with caution because of the relatively small sample size but show some features that can lead to more research...|$|E

The methodology specified by the Brazilian Standard presents methodological issues that brings distortions in obtaining the stress-strain curve, {{as the use of}} a very limited number of sampling points and by inducing micro cracks and fluency in the elastic behavior of the material due to the use of steady stress levels in the test.

40|$|Objective: While {{sensorimotor}} alterations {{have been}} observed in patients with neck pain, it is uncertain whether such changes distinguish whiplash-associated disorders from chronic neck pain without trauma. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate head steadiness during isometric neck flexion in subjects with chronic whiplash-associated disorders (WAD), those with chronic non-traumatic neck pain and healthy subjects. Associations with fatigue and effects of pain and dizziness were also investigated. Methods: Head steadiness in terms of head motion velocity was compared in subjects with whiplash (n= 59), non-traumatic neck pain (n= 57) and healthy controls (n= 57) during 2 40 -s isometric neck flexion tests; a <b>high</b> <b>load</b> <b>test</b> and a low load test. Increased velocity was expected to reflect decreased head steadiness. Results: The whiplash group showed significantly decreased head steadiness in the low load task compared with the other 2 groups. The difference was explained largely by severe levels of neck pain and dizziness. No group differences in head steadiness were found in the high load task. Conclusion: Reduced head steadiness during an isometric holding test was observed in a group of patients with whiplash-associated disorders. Decreased head steadiness was related to severe pain and dizziness...|$|E

Several analysis techniques, both quantitative and qualitative, were used to obtain as much information as possible about the amount and nature of cartilage wear in the cartilage on stainless steel system.

Additionally, the effect of varied injection timing and EGR rates were studied to examine how the engine can be optimized for FT fuel. The test fuels included two standard diesel fuels, one with 400 PPM sulfur content and the other 15 PPM sulfur.

Furthermore, there are no experimental works, to the authors’ knowledge, that compare the performance of single and twin axial groove bearings with the same geometry. An experimental assessment of a journal bearing with either two axial grooves located at +/- 90 º or just one single groove at + 90 º to the load line was performed. The comparison was made by using the same bearing for both groove configurations but the oil feeding to the - 90 º groove was shut with a valve in one of the cases in order to emulate a single groove bearing. Measurements of total and partial lubricant flow rate through each groove, shaft locus, inner bush surface temperature, oil outlet temperature and electrical motor consumption were performed. For the range of applied <b>loads</b> <b>tested</b> the twin groove journal bearing displayed a lower maximum temperature but a higher outlet temperature and eccentricity than the single groove journal bearing. Also the measured total flow rate in the bearing was approximately the same for the single and the twin groove arrangements. For the twin groove bearing, the partial flow rate through each groove varied dramatically with increasing load: At high eccentricities the flow being supplied to the active land of the bearing through the + 90 º groove was much lower than that supplied to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove. Actually, the measured flow rate at the + 90 º groove was almost zero for the <b>highest</b> <b>load</b> <b>tested,</b> with nearly all the lubricant being fed to the non-active land of the bearing through the - 90 º groove.

However, it is known to be relatively unstable.

This study investigated digester behaviour under <b>high</b> <b>loading</b> rates, <b>testing</b> the usefulness of stoichiometric methane conversion efficiency as a digester control parameter at <b>high</b> <b>loading</b> rates. Our results show that, in general, the CH(4) production rate was proportional to the feed rate (loading rate).

Consequently, VFA accumulated and the H(2) partial pressure increased. The proportionality of the loading rate and gas production rate is stoichiometrically expressed as the conversion efficiency. We found that conversion efficiency was a useful indicator as an early warning of digester imbalance. The digester remained stable at conversion efficiencies above 75 %. Dropping below 70 % signified the onset of digester failure.

The hardness of the films reaches 15. 8 GPa for a Cr/CrN multilayered coating sputtered at a bias voltage of - 900 V. <b>High</b> peak <b>load</b> <b>tests</b> were used to estimate the film adhesion on steel substrates; critical loads (Lc 2) of 11 N showed weak adhesion properties of the film. Moreover, an inventory of the major scratch-tests failure modes was established, which were classified into plastic deformation and different forms of cracking, spallation and coating perforation events. No evidence of interfacial failure(s) of the sub-layers was observed after the adhesion and nanoindentation tests...|$|R
40|$|The force-velocity {{relation}} of single frog fibers was measured at sarcomere lengths of 2. 15, 2. 65, and 3. 15 microns. Sarcomere length was obtained on-line {{with a system}} that measures the distance between two markers attached {{to the surface of}} the fiber, approximately 800 microns apart. Maximal shortening velocity, determined by extrapolating the Hill equation, was similar at the three sarcomere lengths: 6. 5, 6. 0, and 5. 7 microns/s at sarcomere lengths of 2. 15, 2. 65, and 3. 15 microns, respectively. For loads not close to zero the shortening velocity decreased with increasing sarcomere length. This was the case when force was expressed as a percentage of the maximal force at optimal fiber length or as a percentage of the sarcomere-isometric force at the respective sarcomere lengths. The force-velocity relation was discontinuous around zero velocity: load clamps above the level that kept sarcomeres isometric resulted in stretch that was much slower than when the load was decreased below isometric by a similar amount. We fitted the force-velocity relation for slow shortening (less than 600 nm/s) and for slow stretch (less than 200 nm/s) with linear regression lines. At a sarcomere length of 2. 15 microns the slopes of these lines was 8. 6 times higher for shortening than for stretch. At 2. 65 and 3. 15 microns the values were 21. 8 and 14. 1, respectively. At a sarcomere length of 2. 15 microm, the velocity of stretch abruptly increased at loads that were 160 – 170 % of the sarcomere isometric load, i. e., the muscle yielded. However, at a sarcomere length of 2. 65 and 3. 15 microm yield was absent at such <b>loads.</b> Even the <b>highest</b> <b>loads</b> <b>tested</b> (260 %) resulted in only slow stretch.

40|$|The {{need for}} dynamic tests of full size {{structures}} has been realized for many years. The only {{way in which}} the parameters of major interest in structural dynamics problems, such as effective dynamic spring constants, energy dissipation characteristics, etc., can be determined, is by tests of actual structures under relatively <b>high</b> <b>loading</b> conditions. Such <b>tests</b> have very seldom been possible because of (1) the difficulty of applying dynamic loads of the required type and magnitude; (2) the difficulty of making the required measurements of dynamic structural responses; and (3) the unavailability of suitable test structures which could be loaded to the point of significant damage...|$|R
