40|$|Context Acute {{pancreatitis}} {{is often}} caused by acute alcoholic intoxication or biliary stone migration. Other etiologies are less frequent. Case report We report an exceptional case of <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcer</b> {{as the cause}} of an acute pancreatitis due to the perforation of the posterior ulcus into the pancreas. More remarkable is the association of a left portal branch thrombosis and a portal biliopathy. Conclusion We describe a case of acute pancreatitis of unusual origin, associated with an equally uncommon pathology which is portal cavernoma. A literature review is then exposed to try to ascertain if there is a connection between these two entities...|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the healing}} effects of Centella asiatica water extract (CE) and asiaticoside (AC), an active {{constituent}} of CE, on acetic acid induced gastric <b>ulcers</b> (<b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers)</b> in rats were examined. CE was prepared from Centella asiatica dry plant and {{the concentration of}} AC in CE was quantitatively determined {{with the use of}} high performance liquid chromatography analysis. Different concentrations of CE and AC were orally administered to rats with <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers.</b> They were found {{to reduce the size of}} the ulcers at day 3 and 7 in a dose-dependent manner, with a concomitant attenuation of myeloperoxidase activity at the ulcer tissues. Epithelial cell proliferation and angiogenesis were on the other hand promoted. The expression of basic fibroblast growth factor, an important angiogenic factor, was also upregulated in the ulcer tissues in rats treated with CE or AC. These results further suggest the potential use of Centella asiatica and its active ingredient as anti-gastric ulcers drugs. © 2004 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|MATERIAL 66 {{cases of}} {{multiple}} ulcers {{of the stomach}} which were examined with X-ray and endoscopy in The First Department of Internal Medicine, Chiba University, and were resected in The First and The Second Surgical Departments, Chiba University, during 6 years, 1960 - 1965, were studied. RESULTS 1) Incidence of Multiple Ulcers The incidence of multiple ulcers cases is 33. 1 % of the gastric ulcer cases resected {{during the same period}} of time. The cases with <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers</b> are 9 cases, and the incidence of the <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers</b> cases in the multiple ulcers cases is 13. 6 %. 2) Ratio of Active Ulcers and Scarred Ulcers 169 lesions of the 66 cases of multiple ulcers were consisted of 88 lesions of active ulcer and 81 lesions of scarred ulcer. The active ulcers are slightly larger in number than the scarred ulcers. 3) Location of Ulcer 61 % of the lesions including both active and scarred ulcers were found in the gastric body, 27. 2 % in the region of incisula angularis and 11. 8 % in the antrum the majority of the ulcers are found in the gastric body. 23. 2 % of the ulcers were found on the anterior wall, 40. 8 % on the lesser curvature, 32. 5 % on the posterior wall and 3. 5 % on the greater curvature. Ulcers occur first on the lesser curvature and second on the posterior wall. 4) Arrangement and Number of Ulcers 54. 5 % of the multiple ulcers were arranged on a line parpendicular to the lesser curvature. This type of arrangement is most frequent. 33. 4 % of the ulcers were arranged with no uniformity on the resected specimen. 59. 1 % of the cases were consisted of two ulcers. As the numbers of ulcer become more, so the cases decrease in number. 5) Age of Cases The majority of the cases with <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers</b> were rather at an advanced age, and other multiple <b>ulcers</b> than <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers</b> were found relatively in the young. 6) Sex Incidence The ratio of occurrence of the multiple ulcers of male to female is 2. 9 : 1. 7) Subjective Complaints Hematemesis and melena occurred in slightly high frequency in cases with multiple ulcers, and pain in the epigastrium highly occurred in cases with multiple ulcers in comparison with single ulcer cases. 8) Detective Ability 35 cases, 53. 0 %, out of the 66 cases could be correctly diagnosed even the numbers of ulcers in the cases. 15 cases of the 66 cases could be diagnosed as multiple ulcers, but numbers of the ulcers could not be correctly diagnosed in these 15 cases. In total, 50 cases, 75. 8 %, of the 66 cases could be diagnoses as multiple ulcers. As to the numbers of the ulcers, 122 lesions, 72. 2 %, out of the 169 ulcers could be diagnosed. 9) X-ray Diagnosis and Endoscopic Diagnosis in Comparison 76. 4 % of the multiple ulcers cases can be diagnosed by X-ray examination, and 81. 9 % of the multiple ulcers cases can be diagnosed by endoscopic examination. 11 cases, 84. 6 %, out of 13 cases which were diagnosed as single ulcer by X-ray examination could be confirmed as multiple ulcers by endoscopic examination. On the contrary, 7 cases, 70. 0 %, out of 10 cases which were diagnosed as single ulcer or were impossible to diagnose by endoscopic examination could be correctly diagnosed as multiple ulcers by X-ray examination...|$|R
40|$|Aim: To {{explore the}} roles of nitric oxide synthase (NOS), heme oxygenase (HO) and {{cyclooxygenase}} (COX) in gastric ulceration and to investigate the relationships of the expression and activities of these enzymes {{at different stages of}} gastric ulceration. Methods: Gastric <b>ulcers</b> (<b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers)</b> were induced by luminal application of acetic acid. Gastric tissue samples were obtained from the ulcer base, ulcer margin, and non-ulcerated area around the ulcer margin at different time intervals after ulcer induction. The mRNA expression and protein levels of inducible and constitutive isoforms of NOS, HO and COX were analyzed with RT-PCR and Western blotting methods. The activities of the total NOS, inducible NOS (iNOS), HO, and COX were also determined. Results: Differential expression of inducible iNOS, HO- 1 and COX- 2 and enzyme activities of NOS, HO and COX were found in the gastric ulcer base. High iNOS expression and activity were observed on day 1 to day 3 in severely inflamed ulcer tissues. Maximum expressions of HO- 1 and COX- 2 and enzyme activities of HO and COX lagged behind that of iNOS, and remained at high levels during the healing phase. Conclusion: The expression and activities of inducible NOS, HO- 1 and COX- 2 are found to be correlated to different stages of gastric ulceration. Inducible NOS may contribute to ulcer formation while HO- 1 and COX- 2 may promote ulcer healing. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|Probiotics {{are widely}} used as {{functional}} foods which have been advocated {{for the maintenance of}} gastrointestinal microflora equilibrium and treatment of gastrointestinal disorders. However, studying the role of probiotics in peptic ulcer disease is limited. The aim of the present study is to investigate the effect of a probiotic strain Lactobacillus rhamnosus GG on gastric ulcer and to elucidate the mechanisms involved. Gastric <b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers</b> were induced in rats by acetic acid (60 % v/v). L. rhamnosus GG was given intragastrically at 10 8  cfu/day or 10 9  cfu/day for three consecutive days after ulcer induction. L. rhamnosus GG successfully colonized in the gastric mucosa especially at the ulcer margin. It also significantly and dose-dependently reduced gastric ulcer area. Cell apoptosis to cell proliferation ratio was strongly decreased and accompanied by significant up-regulation of ornithine decarboxylase (ODC) and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl- 2) protein expression at the ulcer margin. Angiogenesis was also significantly stimulated together with the induction of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) expression. Furthermore, L. rhamnosus GG up-regulated the phosphorylation level of epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF receptor) without altering the total EGF receptor expression. These findings suggested that L. rhamnosus GG enhanced gastric ulcer healing via the attenuation of cell apoptosis to cell proliferation ratio and increase in angiogenesis. Regulators of these processes such as ODC, Bcl- 2, VEGF and EGF receptor are likely {{to be involved in the}} healing action of L. rhamnosus GG for gastric ulcer. © 2007 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Background: Heat shock {{proteins}} are induced when {{cells are}} subjected to noxious stimuli. They afford cytoprotection and increase {{the resistance of the}} tissue to damage. However, their roles in the healing of gastric ulcers have not been well established. In this study, the expression and immunolocalization of three heat shock proteins (HSPs); namely inducible HSP 70 (iHSP 70), HSP 47, and HSP 32 during ulcer healing were investigated in rats with gastric ulcer. Methods: Gastric <b>ulcers</b> (<b>kissing</b> <b>ulcers)</b> were induced by luminal application of acetic acid solution. Gastric tissue samples were obtained from the ulcer base, ulcer margin, and non-ulcerated area around the ulcer margin at different time intervals after ulcer induction. The protein levels and distributions of HSPs were analyzed with Western blotting and immunohistochemical methods, respectively. Results: It was found that all HSPs were expressed in normal, non-ulcerated, and gastric ulcer tissues. HSP 32 was elevated during inflammation (1 - 8 days after ulcer induction), while HSP 47 expression was exacerbated at the ulcer base and margin during ulcer healing (3 - 12 days). Decreased expression of iHSP 70 was observed at the ulcer base immediately after ulcer induction, but returned to normal level {{by the end of the}} healing stage (8 - 12 days). Inducible HSP 70 was found distributed in the gastric glands and injured tissues in the inflamed areas. Wide distribution of HSP 47 was detected in granulation tissues and collagen producing cells, while HSP 32 was localized in the gastric glands and inflammatory cells. Conclusions: The findings indicate that iHSP 70, HSP 47, and HSP 32 play different roles during ulcer healing. HSP 32 seems to act as an inflammatory defensive factor, and HSP 47 as a collagen-specific molecular chaperon contributing significantly to gastric ulcer healing. However, the role of iHSP 70 in the ulcer healing process is still undefined. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
