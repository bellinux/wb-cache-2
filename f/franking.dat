25|$|Australia and New Zealand have a {{dividend}} imputation system, wherein companies can attach <b>franking</b> credits or imputation credits to dividends. These <b>franking</b> credits represent the tax {{paid by the}} company upon its pre-tax profits. One dollar of company tax paid generates one <b>franking</b> credit. Companies can attach any proportion of <b>franking</b> up to a maximum amount that is calculated from the prevailing company tax rate: for each dollar of dividend paid, the maximum level of <b>franking</b> is the company tax rate divided by (1 - company tax rate). At the current 30% rate, this works out at 0.30 of a credit per 70 cents of dividend, or 42.857 cents per dollar of dividend. The shareholders {{who are able to}} use them, apply these credits against their income tax bills at a rate of a dollar per credit, thereby effectively eliminating the double taxation of company profits.|$|E
25|$|In 1955, Israel's first mobile {{post office}} {{began in the}} Negev. By 1990, Israel ran 53 routes for 1,058 locations, {{including}} Israeli settlements in the West Bank and Gaza. Due to hyperinflation, in 1982 and 1984 Israel issued non-denominated stamps. During the 1990s, Israel experimented with vending machines for postal labels (<b>franking</b> labels).|$|E
25|$|The <b>franking</b> {{privilege}} allows {{members of}} Congress to send official mail to constituents at government expense. Though {{they are not}} permitted to send election materials, borderline material is often sent, especially in the run-up to an election by those in close races.

25|$|Worldwide, {{the most}} common method of prepaying postage is by buying an {{adhesive}} postage stamp {{to be applied to}} the envelope before mailing; a much less common method is to use a postage-prepaid envelope. <b>Franking</b> is a method of creating postage-prepaid envelopes under licence using a special machine. They are used by companies with large mail programs, such as banks and direct mail companies.|$|E
25|$|The Royal Mail runs, {{alongside}} its {{stamped mail}} services, another sector of post called business mail. The {{large majority of}} Royal Mail's business mail service is for PPI or franked mail, where the sender prints their own 'stamp'. For PPI mail this involves either a simple rubber stamp and an ink pad, or a printed label. For franked mail, a dedicated <b>franking</b> machine is used.|$|E
25|$|Unlike most {{political}} appointees, Montgomery Blair took personal {{charge of the}} department, organizing an efficient system for the army and navy and abolishing the <b>franking</b> privilege for postmasters. He originated the new practices of free mail delivery and the sorting of mail on railway cars. He developed the return-receipt system for accountability, and innovated the money order system for soldiers to send and receive money from the field. Blair sponsored the first International Postal Congress in Paris in 1863.|$|E

25|$|As {{with so many}} of {{its major}} journeys, the Europe-Pan American flight was largely funded by {{souvenir}} mail franked with special stamps issued by Spain, Brazil, and the United States good only for <b>franking</b> mail carried on one or more legs of the trip. The U.S. issued stamps in three denominations: 65¢ (C-13: 1,135,000 printed; approx 20,000 sold/distributed), $1.30 (C-14: 1,005,000; 30,000), and $2.60 (C-14: 1.070.000; 5,000) all three of which were issued on 19 April 1930.|$|E

25|$|A {{postage meter}} is a {{mechanical}} device {{used to create}} and apply physical evidence of postage, or <b>franking,</b> to mailed matter. Postage meters are regulated by a country's postal authority; for example, in the United States, the United States Postal Service specifies the rules for the creation, support, and use of postage meters. A postage meter imprints an amount of postage, functioning as a postage stamp, a cancellation and a dated postmark all in one. The postage meter was invented by Chicago inventor Arthur Pitney, receiving a patent for the invention on October 14, 1902.|$|E
25|$|Under the Former Presidents Act, {{all living}} former presidents are granted a pension, an office, and a staff. The pension has {{increased}} numerous times with Congressional approval. Retired presidents now receive a pension {{based on the}} salary of the current administration's cabinet secretaries, which was $199,700 each year in 2012. Former presidents who served in Congress may also collect congressional pensions. The act also provides former presidents with travel funds and <b>franking</b> privileges. Prior to 1997, all former presidents, their spouses, and their children until age 16 were protected by the Secret Service until the president's death. In 1997, Congress passed legislation limiting secret service protection {{to no more than}} 10 years from the date a president leaves office. On January 10, 2013, President Obama signed legislation reinstating lifetime secret service protection for him, George W. Bush, and all subsequent presidents. A spouse who remarries is no longer eligible for secret service protection.|$|E
500|$|Although {{passage in}} the House was less {{controversial}} {{than it was in}} the Senate because the constitutional issues did not dominate consideration, the bill met with other procedural obstacles. At the time, Congress was under siege for what was widely perceived as abuse of members' <b>franking</b> privileges. In April, the House had approved H.R. 3180 to clarify what was and was not proper use of <b>franking,</b> and the Senate amended the bill on October 11. The House requested a conference, but the Senate delayed. Supposedly, Senate Post Office and Civil Service Committee Chairman Gale McGee was delaying the <b>franking</b> bill until the Senate-passed post card voter registration bill (...) was put to a House vote. Thus, at first the House inserted <b>franking</b> language in its Saxbe fix bill. On December 3, it suspended its rules to pass the bill 261–129. The Senate then passed the Saxbe fix bill (...) on December 6 without the <b>franking</b> language. The House agreed to the amended bill on December 7. On December 10, Nixon officially submitted the Saxbe nomination. The Judiciary Committee approved Saxbe on December 13 and the full senate confirmed him on December 17 by a 75–10 vote. Ten Democratic senators cited constitutional concerns in opposing this move. Senator Robert C. Byrd, who felt the bar was not avoidable by legislation, explained his position at the time: [...] " [...] so clear that it can't be waived…. We should not delude the American people into thinking a way can be found around the constitutional obstacle." [...] Saxbe did not resign his Senate seat until January 4, 1974, when his wife became eligible for survivor benefits after the completion of his fifth year of service. This delayed his transition to the Cabinet because the Clause expressly prohibits dual service. Saxbe later wrote that although he needed the additional salary he lost (he was earning $42,500 per year as a senator), he was still willing to serve as Attorney General and would get by financially. His biggest fear was that the fix would be ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court several months after he had been in office, and he would have to repay salary already spent.|$|E

500|$|McEwen {{was caught}} up in the House banking scandal, which had been seized upon by Newt Gingrich, a like-minded {{conservative}} House Republican, {{as an example of the}} corruption of Congress; members of the House had been allowed to write checks on their accounts, which were paid despite insufficient funds and without penalty. Martin Gottlieb of the Dayton Daily News said [...] "McEwen was collateral damage" [...] to Gingrich's crusade. McEwen initially denied bouncing any checks. Later, he admitted he had bounced a few. Then when the full totals were released by Ethics Committee investigators, the number was revealed to have been 166 over thirty-nine months. McEwen said that he always had funds available to cover the alleged overdrafts, pointing to the policy of the House sergeant at arms, who ran the House bank, paying checks on an overdrawn account if it would not exceed the sum of the Representative's next paycheck. In 1991, McEwen had also been criticized for his use of the <b>franking</b> privilege and his frequent trips overseas at taxpayer expense, but McEwen defended the trips as part of his work on the Intelligence Committee and in building relationships with legislatures overseas.|$|E

However, rather than the ethnic name of the <b>Franks</b> coming from the word <b>frank</b> ("free"), it is more probable that the word <b>frank</b> ("free") comes from the ethnic name of the <b>Franks,</b> the connection being that only the <b>Franks,</b> as the conquering class, had the status of freemen.|$|R
