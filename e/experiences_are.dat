5|$|According to the AACAP Practice Parameter (2005) the {{question}} of whether attachment disorders can reliably be diagnosed in older children and adults has not been resolved. Attachment behaviors used for the diagnosis of RAD change markedly with development and defining analogous behaviors in older children is difficult. There are no substantially validated measures of attachment in middle childhood or early adolescence. Assessments of RAD past school age may not be possible at all as by this time children have developed along individual lines {{to such an extent that}} early attachment <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> only one factor among many that determine emotion and behavior.|$|E

5000|$|PlanetSide {{featured}} an experience/leveling system. Earned <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} three categories: Battle Experience, Support Experience, and Command <b>Experience.</b> Battle <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> gained from elimination of enemy soldiers, the capture of base facilities, and exploring and interacting with the game world. Support <b>Experience</b> <b>is</b> earned through [...] "Assist" [...] kills: after aiding another player, the first player gains a percentage of experience the other player gains through kills. Command <b>Experience</b> <b>was</b> gained from leading a squad or platoon in a successful base capture. Functionally, Battle Experience and Support <b>Experience</b> <b>are</b> identical, both contributing towards Battle Rank, which lead to benefits {{such as the ability}} to use different equipment, implants, or appearance upgrades. Accumulated Command Experience let the player use several team-oriented abilities.|$|R
5|$|After Jesus' death, his {{followers}} said {{he rose from}} the dead, although exact details of their <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> unclear. Some of those {{who claimed to have}} witnessed Jesus' resurrection later died for their belief, which indicates that their beliefs were likely genuine. According to Sanders, the Gospel reports contradict each other, which, according to him, suggests competition among those claiming to have seen him first rather than deliberate fraud. On the other hand, L. Michael White suggests that inconsistencies in the Gospels reflect differences in the agendas of their unknown authors. The followers of Jesus formed a community to wait for his return and the founding of his kingdom.|$|E
5|$|The Didact and his {{makeshift}} crew {{travel to}} an ancient Precursor planet, Charum Hakkor, where humans had once also settled. The Didact is disturbed to find {{that many of the}} Precursor structures on the planet have fallen into ruin; Precursor structures were thought to be completely indestructible. The Didact also discovers that a prisoner, ensconced in both Precursor and human containment methods, has escaped. They travel to the nearby planet of Faun Hakkor, another formerly human-settled world, to find it stripped of all sentient life, its ecosystem in peril. The Didact sponsors Bornstellar's first mutation, a vital part of Forerunner growth, imprinting himself upon Bornstellar. The Didact's memories, tactics and <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> shared with Bornstellar, giving him insight into the context of the Forerunner-human war and the planets the crew had just visited.|$|E
5|$|Waugh's {{health in}} the winter of 1953–54 was indifferent, and he was beset with various {{personal}} anxieties that were stifling his ability to work. He was also consuming alcohol, bromide and chloral in large amounts. In search of a peaceful environment in which he could resume writing, he embarked on a sea voyage to Ceylon, but was driven to the point of madness by imagined voices that assailed him throughout the voyage. These <b>experiences</b> <b>are</b> mirrored in the novel by those of Pinfold, a successful writer in the Waugh mould who, as an antidote to his lassitude and chronic insomnia, is dosing himself with a similar regimen of drugs. This cocktail brings about a series of hallucinatory episodes during a sea voyage taken by Pinfold {{for the sake of his}} health; he hears voices that insult, taunt and threaten him. He leaves the ship, but his unseen tormentors follow him. On his return to England, his wife convinces him that the voices were imaginary, and his doctor diagnoses poisoning from the bromide and chloral mixture. Pinfold, however, also views the episode as a private victory over the forces of evil.|$|E

30|$|Overall, I do {{not find}} {{statistically}} significant evidence that foreign <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> favored overall by employers in Myanmar.

Specifically, software developers and programmers with foreign <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> highly favored, particularly if the <b>experience</b> <b>was</b> accumulated in the Singapore software industry. When selecting on employer type, I find that the effect of Singapore <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> mainly driven by foreign employers in Myanmar. In contrast, I find no significant effects of foreign experience for accountants and engineers. This is true for both the Singapore and Malaysia experiences, as well as for both local and foreign employers.|$|R
40|$|The commonsense view of {{religious}} <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> {{that it is}} a preconceptual, immediate affective event. Work in philosophy and psychology, however, suggest that religious <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> an attributional cognitive phenomenon. Here the neural correlates of a religious <b>experience</b> <b>are</b> investigated using functional neuroimaging. During religious recitation, self-identified religious subjects activated a frontal-parietal circuit, composed of the dorsolateral prefrontal, dorsomedial frontal and medial parietal cortex. Prior studies indicate that these areas play a profound role in sustaining reflexive evaluation of thought. Thus, religious <b>experience</b> may <b>be</b> a cognitive process which, nonetheless, feels immediate...|$|R

5000|$|In phenomenology, empathy {{describes}} {{the experience of}} something from the other's viewpoint, without confusion between self and other. This draws on the sense of agency.

40|$|One {{diagnosis}} {{of what is}} wrong with the Knowledge Argument rests on the Ability Hypothesis.

Nevertheless I deny that knowing phenomenal propositions is part of knowing what an <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> like. I provide a hybrid account of knowing what an <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> like which is the coherent expression of a single idea: knowing what an <b>experience</b> <b>is</b> like is knowing {{what it would be like}} to have the phenomenal content of the experience as the content of an <b>experience</b> one <b>is</b> currently having.
