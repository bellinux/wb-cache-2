2500|$|Absinthe {{has never}} been illegal to import or {{manufacture}} in Australia. [...] Importation requires a permit under the Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation 1956 due to a restriction on importing any product containing [...] "oil of wormwood".

Prohibited and Restricted Plants and Fungi. [...] However, this amendment was found inconsistent with other parts of the preexisting Food Code. The proposed amendment was withdrawn in 2002 during the transition between the two codes, thereby continuing to allow absinthe manufacture and importation through the existing permit-based system. These events were erroneously reported by the media as Australia having reclassified it from a prohibited product to a restricted product. Since this clarification was made, what is claimed to be the first Australian-produced brand of absinthe (Moulin Rooz) was released in 2007.|$|E
