25|$|At trial, all prison {{officers}} {{testified that}} they did not see Hodson carrying anything and {{that they did}} not see Hodson hit Walker. However, two witnesses, Louis Bailey and Keith Dobson, testified that they saw Hodson carrying something like an <b>iron-bar</b> or baton as he was chasing after Walker. Governor Grindlay testified that he did not see a bar near Hodson's body but that he found one after Hodson's body was loaded into an ambulance.|$|E

60|$|A {{few minutes}} later Larry and his Yankee friend were marched off, this time to a stone {{building}} several squares away. Here they were taken inside, thrust into a cell, the <b>iron-barred</b> door was locked upon them, and they were left to their fate.|$|R
60|$|We found {{ourselves}} in a long vaulted corridor, with a stone-flagged floor, and a dim oil lamp burning at the further end. Two <b>iron-barred</b> windows showed that we had come above the earth's surface once more. Down this corridor we passed, and then through several passages and up a short winding stair. At the head of it was an open door, which led into a small but comfortable bedroom.|$|R

5000|$|John Claudius Loudon (1783-1843), {{a famous}} {{gardener}} (or rather [...] "horticultural writer, dendrologist and designer") {{was born in}} Cambuslang to a respectable farming family. He wrote the Encyclopaedia of Gardening in 1822, and invented a flexible <b>iron-bar</b> sash which made possible such monumental greenhouses as the Palm House at Kew Gardens and the Crystal Palace.|$|E

6000|$|... "No," [...] {{said the}} old man, [...] "and doubtless his {{adventure}} is of a nature in line with thy puerile and effeminate teachings. Had he followed my training, without thy accurst priestly interference, he had made an <b>iron-barred</b> nest in Torn {{for many of the}} doves of thy damned English nobility. An' thou leave him not alone, he will soon be seeking service in the household of the King." ...|$|R
5000|$|Rail {{cars have}} been used to {{transport}} livestock since the 1830s. The first shipments in the United States were made via the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad in general purpose, open-topped cars with semi-open sides. Thereafter, and until 1860, the majority of shipments were made in conventional boxcars that had been fitted with open-structured <b>iron-barred</b> doors for ventilation. Some railroads constructed [...] "combination" [...] cars that could be utilized for carrying both live animals as well as conventional freight loads.|$|R
60|$|Pan {{found himself}} ushered {{into a large}} room with small <b>iron-barred</b> windows on the west side. His {{experience}} of frontier jails had been limited, but those he had seen had been bare, empty, squalid cells. This, however, was evidently a luxurious kind of a prison house. There were Indian blankets and rugs on the floor, an open fireplace with cheerful blaze, a table littered with books and papers, a washstand, a comfortable bed upon which reclined a man smoking and reading.|$|R
50|$|The Mukono District {{is known}} for robbery, theft, {{domestic}} violence, defilement, witchcraft, child sacrifice and other crimes. Iron bar crime, which are locally referred to as butayibwa, have led those categories in the recent years. Attacks by <b>iron-bar</b> hit-men have become an epidemic in the Mukono district of Uganda. Justine Nakulima was attacked by iron bar hit men at 5 a.m. {{on her way to}} work and survived. Beside pedestrians cyclists are also attacked. Cyclists hired by people pretending to be customers are hit. Nothing is stolen from these victims in most cases. According to Dr. George Kasirye, who is the Medical Officer at the Mukono Health Centre IV, the hospital receives at least two victims of <b>iron-bar</b> crimes every week and some victims never even seek help from the hospital. The problem has also spread to other parts of Uganda. Districts such as Kampala, Wakiso, Hoima, Mbale and others have seen similar attacks happening there. Many do not know why these attacks keep happening or who is behind the attacks. Susani Borgere, a councilor in the Mukono Central Division, thinks the attacks are a major cause of unemployment, drug abuse, and poor police operation in the country.|$|E
5000|$|A 9 m2 {{rectangular}} <b>iron-bar</b> made {{structure was}} constructed, having four [...] grooves in its four s for holding floats of plastic drums. The whole {{bottom of the}} structure {{was surrounded by a}} rectangular nylon net cage with the dimensions of length-3.66 m × width-2.44 m × depth-1.25 m. Under the four corners and middle points of the net, half-brick weights were hung to ensure that the net retained a rectangular structure under the water. In the middle of both widths of IFCAS, two pits filled with dried pond mud of the same pond are used as medium for vegetable plantation. On the top of the structure, a scaffold was made using split bamboo and net for vegetables to climb on.|$|E
50|$|In 1823, {{during the}} Absolutist Reaction, a French Army (the {{so-called}} Hundred Thousand Sons of St. Louis) invaded Spain to restore absolutism, the liberal regime fell, and Díez fled to Portugal. From there, he asked permission to return without danger of detainment, a request which was granted. But upon his return, {{he was arrested}} near Olmillos de Peñafiel and moved to Nava de Roa (Burgos) where he {{was turned over to}} the mayor, Gregorio González. He was there imprisoned and displayed in an <b>iron-bar</b> cage. Leopoldo O'Donnell, a liberal military leader, learned of Díez's situation and attempted to have Díez's case heard in a tribunal. The magistrate in Roa de Duero, however, had already ordered Díez's execution, which was carried out on August 20, 1825, in the central plaza of the village. Díez died, hanged in lieu of being shot. It is said that in an outburst of desperation and strength, Díez managed to take the sword from the official that accompanied him to the gallows.|$|E
50|$|On 6 April 1681 Blackadder {{was arrested}} in Edinburgh by Major Johnston. He was tried and found guilty, and imprisoned on the Bass Rock. He was {{confined}} in a cell with three small <b>iron-barred</b> windows facing west. His health deteriorated due to the harsh conditions. After he fell ill in prison, the privy council gave permission {{for him to leave}} as long as he remained in Edinburgh, but he was already too ill. He died in prison at the end of 1685, aged sixty-three, and was buried in North Berwick churchyard.|$|R
50|$|The {{place is}} perfect for the purpose, with ample grounds for cricket and football, and plenty of rooms of various sizes ideal for {{classrooms}} and dormitories. Its stables, with their thick walls and <b>iron-barred</b> windows, have been put {{to use as a}} gymnasium, carpenter's shop and general storage area, but also make a handy fortress in event of a siege. It is two miles (3 km) from the village, where the principal watering-hole is the Feathers, the barmaid of which, a Miss Benjafield, is a stately type who disapproves of Americans.|$|R
5000|$|Gold Gulch {{occupied}} the canyon between the 'Casa de Balboa' and 'Pepper Grove,' {{southeast of the}} Spreckles Organ Pavilion. It was composed of a dance hall and a music hall, rustic unpainted shacks, a brick bank with <b>iron-barred</b> windows, a [...] "Chinese restaurant and laundry," [...] and a Hanging tree with 'dummy' hanging. Barkers lured visitors to a [...] "shooting gallery" [...] where a visiting [...] "sharpshooter" [...] hitting the bull's eye put all the lights out in the Gulch. An [...] "Indian Village" [...] was nearby, with trading posts and events.|$|R
50|$|During {{its service}} life, the H-5/HO3S-1 {{was used for}} utility, rescue, and mercy {{missions}} throughout the world, including flights during Operation Highjump in the Antarctic. While the extra power of the H-5 made it significantly more useful than its R-4 and R-6 cousins, the H-5/HO3S-1 suffered, like most early small tandem-seat single-rotor machines, from center of gravity problems. As a matter of routine, the helicopter was equipped with two <b>iron-bar</b> weights - each in a canvas case - one of 25 lb & one of 50 lb. Flying with no passengers, both weights were placed forward alongside the pilot. With three passengers, both weights were normally placed in the baggage compartment. However, in conditions of high ambient temperatures, which reduced lift due to the lowered air density, all weights were jettisoned. If the weights could not be recovered later, pilots on future missions were forced to utilize rocks or other improvised weights next to the pilot after offloading three passengers, or else travel at a very slow 25 kn.|$|E
5000|$|In 2004, the zoo {{was struck}} by {{financial}} problems {{and was forced to}} reduce its collection size temporarily by closing parts of the zoo. [...] The original Main Valley was closed due to its age, being incapable of holding animals comfortably with their older style of <b>iron-barred</b> cages and stone walls, and in addition, the Reptile House which is located some distance away from the main zoo in an adjacent section of the Park was closed. The reptiles, as well as gibbons, tigers, and snow leopards, were sent to other zoos and aquariums.|$|R
60|$|Forrest {{closed the}} door and went on along a passage that was like a tunnel. Narrow, <b>iron-barred</b> openings, like the slits for archers in medieval castles, dimly lighted the way. Another door gave access to a long, low room, beam-ceilinged, with a {{fireplace}} in which an ox could have been roasted. A huge stump, resting on a bed of coals, blazed brightly. Two billiard tables, several card tables, lounging corners, and a miniature bar constituted the major furnishing. Two young men chalked their cues and returned Forrest's greeting.|$|R
2500|$|Although The Starry Night {{was painted}} {{during the day}} in Van Gogh's ground-floor studio, it would be {{inaccurate}} to state that the picture was painted from memory. The view {{has been identified as}} the one from his bedroom window, facing east, a view which Van Gogh painted variations of no fewer than twenty-one times, including The Starry Night. [...] "Through the <b>iron-barred</b> window," [...] he wrote to his brother, Theo, around 23 May 1889, [...] "I can see an enclosed square of wheat [...] [...] [...] above which, in the morning, I watch the sun rise in all its glory." ...|$|R
60|$|An artist, it is true, might often thank his {{stars for}} those old houses, so picturesquely time-stained, {{and with the}} plaster falling in blotches from the ancient brick-work. The prison-like, <b>iron-barred</b> windows, and the wide arched, dismal entrance, admitting on one hand to the stable, on {{the other to the}} kitchen, might impress him as far better worth his pencil than the newly painted pine boxes, in which--if he be an American--his countrymen live and thrive. But there is reason to suspect that a people are waning to decay and ruin the moment that their life becomes {{fascinating}} either in the poet's imagination or the painter's eye.|$|R
60|$|At {{the top of}} {{the first}} flight was a solid door through which they passed, to find {{themselves}} in a large and darksome place. Down the centre of this place ran a passage. On either side of the passage, dimly lighted by high <b>iron-barred</b> windows, were cages built of massive oaken bars, and measuring each of them eight or ten feet square, very dens such as might have served for wild beasts, but filled with human beings charged with offences against the doctrines of the Church. Those who chance to have seen the prison of the Inquisition at The Hague as it still stands to-day, will know what they were like.|$|R
60|$|Once indeed, on {{the lower}} landing-place, the {{sculptor}} fancied {{that there was a}} momentary stir inside the door, as if somebody were listening at the threshold. He hoped, at least, that the small <b>iron-barred</b> aperture would be unclosed, through which Roman housekeepers are wont to take careful cognizance of applicants for admission, from a traditionary dread, perhaps, of letting in a robber or assassin. But it remained shut; neither was the sound repeated; and Kenyon concluded that his excited nerves had played a trick upon his senses, as they are apt to do when we most wish for the clear evidence of the latter.|$|R
50|$|Taking {{advantage}} of the disturbance that spread to Newgate next door and continued into the night, Sheppard escaped yet again in early 16 October. Sheppard had broken the chains, padlocks, and six <b>iron-barred</b> doors. This escape astonished everyone, and Daniel Defoe, working as a journalist, wrote an account. In the early morning on 1 November, Sheppard was found for a fifth and final time by a constable and arrested. This time, Sheppard {{was placed in the}} centre of Newgate, where he could be observed at all times, and loaded with three hundred pounds of iron weights. He was so celebrated that the gaolers charged high society visitors to see him, and James Thornhill painted his portrait.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh {{worked on}} a group of {{paintings}} The Wheat Field based on the field of wheat enclosed by a wall that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital. Beyond the field were the mountains from Arles. During his stay at the asylum he made about twelve paintings of the view of the enclosed wheat field and distant mountains. [...] In May Van Gogh wrote to Theo, [...] "Through the <b>iron-barred</b> window I see a square field of wheat in an enclosure, a perspective like Van Goyen, above which I see the morning sun rising in all its glory." [...] The stone wall, like a picture frame, helped to display the changing colors of the wheat field.|$|R
60|$|Pancrazio {{returned}} with the lantern, and opened the big door. Alvina followed him into a stone-floored, wide passage, where stood farm implements, where a little of straw and beans lay in a corner, and whence rose bare wooden stairs. So much she saw in the glimpse of lantern-light, as Pancrazio pulled the string and entered the kitchen: a dim-walled room with a vaulted roof and a great dark, open hearth, fireless: a bare room, with a little rough dark furniture: an unswept stone floor: <b>iron-barred</b> windows, rather small, in the deep-thickness of the wall, one-half shut with a drab shutter. It was rather like a room on the stage, gloomy, {{not meant to be}} lived in.|$|R
60|$|For me! I am a beast, a reptile, {{and know}} nothing! From the cave of my ignorance, amid the fogs of my dulness, and pestilential fumes of my {{political}} heresies, I {{look up to}} thee, as doth a toad through the <b>iron-barred</b> lucarne of a pestiferous dungeon, to the cloudless glory of a summer sun! Sorely sighing in bitterness of soul, I say, When shall my name be the quotation of the wise, and my countenance be the delight of the godly, like the illustrious lord of Laggan's many hills?[124] As for him, his works are perfect: never did the pen of calumny blur the fair page of his reputation, nor the bolt of hatred fly at his dwelling.|$|R
60|$|This credulity, {{unfortunately}} {{extends to}} ghosts. A rational person fresh {{from his own}} house would have turned on his side and slept. I did not. So surely as I was given up as a bad carcass by the scores {{of things in the}} bed because the bulk of my blood was in my heart, so surely did I hear every stroke of a long game at billiards played in the echoing room behind the <b>iron-barred</b> door. My dominant fear was that the players might want a marker. It was an absurd fear; because creatures who could play in the dark would be above such superfluities. I only know that that was my terror; and it was real.|$|R
5000|$|Van Gogh {{worked on}} a group of {{paintings}} [...] "The Wheat Field" [...] that he could see from his cell at Saint-Paul Hospital.

60|$|That same afternoon, {{the massive}} gray square tower {{of an old}} Cathedral rises before {{the sight of a}} jaded traveller. The bells are going for daily vesper service, and he must needs attend it, one would say, from his haste to reach the open Cathedral door. The choir are getting on their sullied white robes, in a hurry, when he arrives among them, gets on his own robe, and falls into the {{procession}} filing in to service. Then, the Sacristan locks the <b>iron-barred</b> gates that divide the sanctuary from the chancel, and all of the procession having scuttled into their places, hide their faces; and then the intoned words, ‘WHEN THE WICKED MAN—’ rise among groins of arches and beams of roof, awakening muttered thunder.|$|R
60|$|Mounting {{the broad}} {{staircase}} that ascended {{from the entrance}} hall, they traversed the great wilderness of a house, through some obscure passages, {{and came to a}} low, ancient doorway. It admitted them to a narrow turret stair which zigzagged upward, lighted in its progress by loopholes and <b>iron-barred</b> windows. Reaching the top of the first flight, the Count threw open a door of worm-eaten oak, and disclosed a chamber that occupied the whole area of the tower. It was most pitiably forlorn of aspect, with a brick-paved floor, bare holes through the massive walls, grated with iron, instead of windows, and for furniture an old stool, which increased the dreariness of the place tenfold, by suggesting an idea of its having once been tenanted.|$|R

6000|$|The priest, {{during his}} walk from Drumsna, {{had made up}} his mind exactly as to what he would say on seeing Thady; how he would mix pity with condolence; how he would use such words as might {{strengthen}} him in his determination to bear his sufferings with resignation; how he would teach him to forget the present in the thoughts of his future prospects. But when the iron door was opened, and he saw Macdermot seated on the one small stone seat in the wall beneath the high, <b>iron-barred</b> window; when his eye rested on the young man's pale and worn face, he forgot all his studied phrases and premeditated conduct, his acute grief overcame his ideas of duty, and falling on the prisoner's bosom, he sobbed out, [...] "My boy--my boy--my poor murdered boy!" ...|$|R
6000|$|For {{us there}} is only one season, the season of sorrow. The very sun and moon seem taken from us. Outside, the day may be blue and gold, but the light that creeps down through the thickly-muffled glass of the small <b>iron-barred</b> window beneath which one sits is grey and niggard. It is always {{twilight}} in one's cell, as it is always twilight in one's heart. And in the sphere of thought, no less than in the sphere of time, motion is no more. The thing that you personally have long ago forgotten, or can easily forget, is happening to me now, and will happen to me again to- morrow. Remember this, and {{you will be able to}} understand a little of why I am writing, and in this manner writing. [...] .|$|R
