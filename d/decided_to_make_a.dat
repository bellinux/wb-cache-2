5|$|Lucullus had {{initially}} <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> running charge with his infantry, a Roman military tactic that minimized {{the amount of}} time an enemy could utilize its archers and sling infantry prior to close combat engagement. However, he decided against this at the last moment when he realized that the Armenian cataphracts posed the greatest threat to his men, ordering instead a diversionary attack with his Gallic and Thracian cavalry against the cataphracts.|$|E

5|$|After {{releasing}} Clannad, Jun Maeda <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> game {{based on}} Tomoyo's scenario from Clannad. Maeda handled the game's planning and scenario, and Leo Kashida, {{a new member}} of the team, accompanied him. As opposed to Itaru Hinoue who was the character designer and art director for Clannad, Fumio was the art director for Tomoyo After, while Hinoue helped Fumio with the character design. As such, characters who appeared in Clannad such as Tomoya and Tomoyo look similar but visibly different from when in Clannad. Maeda also composed the music for the game along with Key's signature composers Shinji Orito and Magome Togoshi.|$|E
5|$|During {{the filming}} of his directorial debut Vandemataram (1939) at Hampi, Bommireddy Narasimha Reddy visited the Virupaksha Temple to capture {{the beauty of the}} monuments, which {{reflected}} the taste and artistic outlook of Krishnadevaraya, king of the Vijayanagara Empire. At the heart of the temple, Narasimha Reddy felt that he was standing exactly at a place where Krishnadevaraya had once stood and offered prayers to the deity. From that moment, Reddy <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film in which Krishnadevaraya would be the main character, and he began working on the script.|$|E
5|$|In 1980, Australian author Thomas Keneally {{by chance}} visited Pfefferberg's luggage store in Beverly Hills while en route {{home from a}} film festival in Europe. Pfefferberg took the {{opportunity}} to tell Keneally the story of Oskar Schindler. He gave him copies of some materials he had on file, and Keneally soon <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> fictionalised treatment of the story. After extensive research and interviews with surviving Schindlerjuden, his 1982 historical novel Schindler's Ark (published in the United States as Schindler's List) was the result.|$|E

5|$|In November 2004, Ledonne {{discovered}} {{a program called}} RPG Maker, which allows a developer to add images, text, story and objectives to design a game; RPG Maker creates the necessary programming automatically. Ledonne had always conceptualized video games throughout his childhood but never produced one due to his lack of technical knowledge; with RPG Maker {{he was able to}} fulfill his ambition. Ledonne <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> game that would explore why the Columbine shootings occurred, as well as refuting pervasive myths about the shooters and the alleged role video games played in the massacre.|$|E
5|$|In late July 1861, Lowe {{inflated}} {{a balloon}} in Washington with hopes of providing aerial {{coverage for the}} impending Battle of Bull Run, but a violent storm buffeted the inflated balloon and delayed Lowe until word of the Union defeat reached him on the road.

Over the next few days, he repeatedly ascended in the balloon {{in order to make}} maps of the surrounding area and gather intelligence about Confederate troops advancing on Washington.|$|E

The young prince, {{despite the fact that he}} only had a part of his forces, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> quick attack. This completely surprised the defenders and fearing the same fate of soldiers from Strzelce Krajeńskie, they decided to surrender the fortress in exchange for a full pardon. After this, Przemysł II took the fortress in the name of his uncle and triumphantly returned home.|$|E

5|$|The M3 Gun Motor Carriage (GMC) was a United States Army tank {{destroyer}} {{equipped with}} one 75mm gun and {{was produced by}} Autocar. After the fall of France, the U.S. Army <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> self-propelled artillery piece from the M1897A4 gun on the M3 chassis, which was designated the T12. After some improvement, it came into production as the M3 Gun Motor Carriage. However, the supply of M2A3 gun shields was insufficient for production needs, so a new gun shield was used.

5|$|The final scene, {{in which}} Radar informs {{everyone}} {{of the death}} of Henry Blake was unprecedented: {{it was the first time}} in American television history that a main character departing a comedy series was killed off in a tragic way. When Stevenson decided to leave the series part way through the third season, Gene Reynolds and Larry Gelbart, the show's producers, <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> statement regarding the unexpectedness and horror of war, especially with the Vietnam War fresh in people's minds.|$|E
5|$|The wreck is {{generally}} intact although draped with snagged fishing nets. The aft turret, however, has fallen out off the ship. The vertical {{position of the}} wreck has inspired a new theory of her loss by nautical archaeologist Vello Mäss. He believes that Rusalka was taking on water forward, perhaps from a leak or through ventilation hatches and was bow-heavy when her captain <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> turn, possibly to return to Reval, and the ship capsized during the turn with her engines still running. Her forward speed and flooded forward hull meant that she descended vertically and drove her hull into the muddy sea bottom.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 2 is {{the only}} {{spacecraft}} that has visited Neptune. The spacecraft closest approach to the planet occurred on 25 August 1989. Because {{this was the last}} major planet the spacecraft could visit, it was <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> close flyby of the moon Triton, regardless of the consequences to the trajectory, similarly to what was done for Voyager 1s encounter with Saturn and its moon Titan. The images relayed back to Earth from Voyager 2 became the basis of a 1989 PBS all-night program, Neptune All Night.|$|E

5|$|Digging for Fire {{was based}} on a real {{incident}} in which Jake Johnson and his wife dug up a bone and a gun in the garden of a house they had rented. Over a couple of weeks, he and a group of his friends dug up various objects before deciding to bury them again. Johnson described the experience to Joe Swanberg about three years later and they <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> film about it. They wrote a two-and-a-half–page outline that summarized the plot but included no dialogue or detailed character descriptions. Swanberg wanted the actors to improvise the details of each scene and allowed them to make choices about their characters: for instance, Orlando Bloom decided that his character would ride a motorcycle, Chris Messina suggested that his character go swimming naked, and Brie Larson persuaded Johnson and Swanberg that her character would not be sexually attracted to Tim.|$|E
5|$|Eastwood {{was then}} offered {{the role of}} Benjamin L. Willard in Francis Coppola's Apocalypse Now, but {{declined}} as {{he did not want}} to spend weeks on location in the Philippines. He also refused the part of a platoon leader in Ted Post's Vietnam War film, Go Tell the Spartans and instead <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> third Dirty Harry film, The Enforcer. The film had Callahan partnered with a new female officer (Tyne Daly) to face a San Francisco Bay area group resembling the Symbionese Liberation Army. The film, culminating in a shootout on Alcatraz island, was considerably shorter than the previous Dirty Harry films at 95minutes, but was a major commercial success grossing $100million worldwide to become Eastwood's highest-grossing film to date.|$|E
5|$|From Madras, Müller had {{originally}} intended to rendezvous with his colliers off Simalur Island in Indonesia, but instead <b>decided</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> <b>a</b> foray to {{the western side of}} Ceylon. On 25 September, Emden sank a pair of British merchantmen and two days later, captured the collier Buresk, which was carrying a cargo of high-grade coal. A German prize crew went aboard Buresk and she was thereafter used to support Emdens operations. Later that day, the German raider sank two more British vessels. Low on fuel, Emden proceeded to the Maldives to coal. She arrived there on 29 September and remained for a day while her crew replenished her coal stocks. The raider then cruised the routes between Aden and Australia and between Calcutta and Mauritius for two days without success. Emden thereafter steamed to Diego Garcia for engine maintenance and to rest her crew.|$|E
