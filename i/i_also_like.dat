500|$|The film {{features}} a musical score by Aaron Zigman, {{who was hired}} after Alison Krauss {{backed out of the}} job. Zigman mentioned that there are similarities between the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia and the film Flicka in that [...] "...at times there's a bit of a Celtic influence but not much", but he also {{went on to say that}} there was a more modern feel to the music he composed for Bridge to Terabithia. He did so as Csupó requested him to do not compose [...] "your typical Hollywood Score"; he then mixed up orchestral melody with [...] "a bit of a modern flavor." [...] The score he composed for the film is described as [...] "very large" [...] compared to his other work, and Zigman commented that [...] "Aside from the minimalist stuff and coloring that I love to do, <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> big orchestral stuff, and want to do more of that, and this film enabled me to spread my wings out a bit." [...] The official soundtrack for the film was released as Music from and Inspired by Bridge to Terabithia by Hollywood Records on February 13, 2007.|$|E

In 2008, she {{starred in the}} Doctor Who episode [...] "Midnight", playing an intergalactic Hostess alongside David Tennant's Tenth Doctor. In 2009, Ayola starred in the CBBC musical comedy My Almost Famous Family. She stated: [...] "The script made me laugh out loud when I read it. [...] <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> {{the fact that there}} were a lot of correct boxes being ticked, but the writers and producer haven't been restrained by that. [...] "So, instead of bowing to this altar, they've said, 'Okay, we have this family that's half-black, half-white, half-American, half-British. We have a mix of boys and girls, one character who's mixed-raced and deaf – but we're not going to be restrained by any of that. We're not going to tiptoe around Martha's disability or anything.' I liked that. It wasn't some sort of reverential hands-off approach to what we're presenting." [...] She has also been cast in the film Dredd. She will join the cast of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child at the Palace Theatre, London from 24 May 2017, playing the role of Hermione Granger.|$|E

500|$|According to writer Linda Ruth Williams, {{the music}} video {{attracted}} {{attention from the}} press because of [...] "the clash between Spears' wholesome image and Dark's unwholesome back catalogue." [...] A Spears representative spoke to the Sunday Sport and revealed, [...] "as far as I'm aware the director just does music videos. This is a video for young teenage girls and not sexy at all." [...] Dark responded to the negative reviews saying, [...] "I don't deny that I did , it's just that <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> {{people to know that}} I don't currently and haven't in a long time." [...] Billboard reporter Carla Hay also noted, [...] "I don't think people who buy records are too concerned about the background of the video's director." [...] Lucy O'Brien, author of She Bop II: The Definitive History of Women in Rock, Pop and Soul, noted that hiring Dark as the video director implied that Spears was not that innocent. Time journalists Briton Hadden and Henry Robinson Luce said that Spears [...] "may be the queen of pop tartiness, but her new video, 'From the Bottom of My Broken Heart', is an entirely wholesome affair," [...] while Chris Ryan of MTV considered it [...] "a suitably soft-focus affair". The video was also added to MTV's 2000 Yearbook, a list with the [...] "biggest, best, most memorable music videos of every year since the beginning of MTV." ...|$|E

Lotterer planned to compete at Monza but following the decision made by Caterham team principal Colin Kolles to run Formula Renault 3.5 Series driver Roberto Merhi in the first practice session, he opted not to return. He explained to the press that because of his [...] "rookie" [...] driver status, he needed the maximum amount of on-track time he could receive. Kobayashi said he was looking forward to testing updates to the CT05 chassis and {{that he did not have}} any doubts over the team's decision to change drivers: [...] "I always enjoy the Italian GP, not only because of its high-speed nature; <b>I</b> <b>also</b> <b>like</b> the Italian fans, they are always very enthusiastic and a very big part of the Italian GP weekend.

6000|$|Had the Westminster triumph been {{altogether}} {{a triumph}} {{it would have}} become the pleasant duty of some popular Conservative to express to Melmotte the pleasure he would have in introducing his new political ally to the House. In such case Melmotte himself would have been walked up the chamber with a pleasurable ovation and the thing would have been done without trouble to him. But now {{this was not the}} position of affairs. Though the matter was debated at the Carlton, no such popular Conservative offered his services. 'I don't think we ought to throw him over,' Mr Beauclerk said. Sir Orlando Drought, quite a leading Conservative, suggested that as Lord Nidderdale was very intimate with Mr Melmotte he might do it. But Nidderdale was not the man for such a performance. He was a very good fellow and everybody liked him. He belonged to the House because his father had territorial influence in a Scotch county;--but he never did anything there, and his selection for such a duty would be a declaration to the world that nobody else would do it. 'It wouldn't hurt you, Lupton,' said Mr Beauclerk. 'Not at all,' said Lupton; 'but <b>I</b> <b>also,</b> <b>like</b> Nidderdale am a young man and of no use,--and a great deal too bashful.' Melmotte, who knew but little about it, went down to the House at four o'clock, somewhat cowed by want of companionship, but carrying out his resolution that he would be stopped by no phantom fears,--that he would lose nothing by want of personal pluck. He knew that he was a Member, and concluded that if he presented himself {{he would be able to}} make his way in and assume his right. But here again fortune befriended him. The very leader of the party, the very founder of that new doctrine of which it was thought that Melmotte might become an apostle and an expounder,--who, as the reader may remember, had undertaken to be present at the banquet when his colleagues were dismayed and untrue to him, and who kept his promise and sat there almost in solitude,--he happened to be entering the House, as his late host was claiming from the doorkeeper the fruition of his privilege. 'You had better let me accompany you,' said the Conservative leader, with something of chivalry in his heart. And so Mr Melmotte was introduced to the House by the head of his party! When this was seen many men supposed that the rumours had been proved to be altogether false. Was not this a guarantee sufficient to guarantee any man's respectability? ...|$|E
