25|$|Service resumed in South Neebing on March 18, {{after being}} {{cancelled}} in 2004 due to low ridership. The route operated on Tuesday and Thursday, with two {{runs in the}} morning and two runs in the afternoon. The route averaged 1 passenger per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and cost $73 per passenger to operate. The trial cost $19,200, and brought in only $400 in revenue, resulting in a net cost of $18,800. Service to South Neebing ended on November 27.|$|E
25|$|Service resumed in McIntyre on June 4, after a {{telephone}} {{survey conducted by}} the city found some demand for transit service in the area, which had bus service in the 1980s and 1990s.

The route averaged 0.5 passengers per <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> and cost $148 per passenger to operate.

[4] That Mr. Hugh Littlepage {{does not}} feel or express himself too {{strongly}} {{on the state of}} things that has now existed among us for long, long years, the following case, but one that illustrates the melancholy truth among many, will show. At a time when the tenants of an extensive landlord, to whom tens of thousands were owing for rent, were openly resisting the law, and defeating every attempt to distrain, though two ordinary companies of even armed constables would have put them down, the sheriff entered the house of that very landlord, and levied on his furniture for debt. Had that gentleman, on the just and pervading principle that he owed no allegiance to an authority that did not protect him, resisted the sheriff's officer, he would have gone to the State's prison; and there he might have staid until his last <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> was expended.--EDITOR.|$|E

60|$|He {{walked with}} me {{as far as the}} main road to Ambleside. As we passed the little chapel built by Lady Fleming, which has been the occasion, as you remember, of one of his poems, there were persons, {{tourists}} evidently, talking with the sexton at the door. Their inquiries, I fancied, were about Wordsworth, perhaps as to the <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> the next day (Sunday), with the hope of seeing him there. One of them caught sight of the venerable man at the moment, and at once seemed to perceive who it was, for she motioned to the others to look, and they watched him with earnest gaze. I was struck with their looks of delighted admiration. He stopped when we reached the main road, saying that his strength would not allow him to walk further. Giving me his hand, he desired again to be remembered to you and others in America, and wished me a safe return to my friends, and so we parted. I went on my way, happy in the recollection of this, to me, memorable interview. My mind was in a tumult of excitement, for I felt that I had been in the familiar presence of one of the noblest of our race; and this sense of Wordsworth's intellectual greatness had been with me during the whole interview. I may speak, too, of the strong perception of his moral elevation which I had at the same time. No word of unkindness had fallen from him. He seemed to be living as if in the presence of God, by habitual recollection. A strange feeling, almost of awe, had impressed me while I was thus with him. Believing that his memory will be had in honour in all coming time, I could not but be thankful that I had been admitted to intimate intercourse with him then, when he was so near the end of life. To you, my dear friend, I must again say I owe this happiness, and to you it has been denied. You also, of all others of our countrymen, would have most valued such an interview, for to you the great Poet's heart has been in an especial manner opened in private correspondence. No other American has he honoured in the same degree; and by no one else in this country has the knowledge and appreciation of his poetry been so much extended. The love which has so long animated you has been such, that multitudes have been influenced to seek for joy and refreshment from the same pure source.|$|E

50|$|These 2014 {{performance}} measure data depicted above indicate {{a lower cost}} per passenger and cost per revenue <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> for Spokane Transit compared to total fixed route operations in Washington State. In 2005, an average 20.81 unlinked passenger trips took place per revenue hour of fixed route service. By 2014 that figure jump to 28.9 unlinked passenger trips per revenue hour. This dramatic increase in service productivity has minimized growth in the cost per passenger despite growth in fuel costs, health benefits and other inflation factors during that period.|$|E

These credits accumulate- users may keep them for when they become sick or elderly themselves, then use the credits in exchange for services. Alternatively, the users may transfer credits to someone else.|$|E

50|$|In economics, a {{time-based}} {{currency is}} an alternative currency or exchange system where the unit of account/value is the person-hour or some other time unit.Some time-based currencies value everyone’s contributions equally: one hour equals one service credit. In these systems, one person volunteers to work for an hour for another person; thus, they are credited with one hour, which they can redeem for an <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> from another volunteer. Others use time units that might be fractions of an hour (e.g. minutes, ten minutes - 6 units/hour, or 15 minutes - 4 units/hour). While most time-based exchange systems are service exchanges in that most exchange involves the provision of services that {{can be measured in}} a time unit, it is also possible to exchange goods by 'pricing' them in terms of the average national hourly wage rate (e.g. if the average hourly rate is $20/hour, then a commodity valued at $20 in the national currency would be equivalent to 1 hour).|$|E
30|$|Preliminary {{investigation}} {{revealed that}} {{an average of}} ten trains took off from the Iddo terminus every day. These comprised three Diesel Multiple Units (DMUs) and seven Mass Transit Trains (MTTs). Each DMU had three coaches, while each MTT had ten coaches with 72 and 90 coach seating capacities, respectively. Two, two {{and three of the}} seven MTTs, and each of the three DMU trains were scheduled for operation in the morning, afternoon and evening hours of service, respectively. Three MTTs were randomly selected, one for each <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> while all the three DMUs were selected for the three hours of service—one for each service hour. Thus, for each <b>hour</b> <b>of</b> <b>service,</b> one MTT and one DMU were covered by the survey. In each train, 50 % of the coaches were randomly sampled: five MTTs and two DMUs. In each coach, 10 % of the passengers were randomly selected for survey: nine in each MTT coach and eight in each DMU coach. As such, 45 passengers were selected from each MTT coach, while 16 passengers were selected from each DMU. In all, a total of 135 passengers were selected from the MTT, while a total of 48 passengers were selected from the DMU. Eventually, a grand total of 183 law-abiding passengers, who were not involved in rooftop riding, were surveyed in this study. Simple descriptive statistical tools were employed in the analysis of the data collected. The tools were mainly frequency distribution and percentages. In addition, content analysis was used to analyse the responses to interview questions and the open-ended questions in the questionnaires.|$|E
