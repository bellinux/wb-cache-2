5|$|Although {{previous}} {{attempts to}} create a Simpsons film had been made, they failed {{due to the lack}} of a script of appropriate length and production crew members.

They conceived numerous plot ideas, with Groening's being the one developed into a film. The script was re-written over a hundred times, and this rewriting continued after the animation had begun in 2006. Consequently, hours of finished material was cut from the final release, including cameo roles from Erin Brockovich, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher, Kelsey <b>Grammer</b> and Edward Norton. Hanks and Green Day appeared in the final cut as themselves.|$|E
