50|$|The Marine Information for Safety and Law Enforcement (MISLE) is a {{database}} system managed {{and used by}} the United States Coast Guard (USCG). The MISLE is used to store data on marine accidental and <b>deliberate</b> <b>pollution</b> and other shipping and port accidents in US territorial waters. It accounts for vessels and other facilities, like port terminals and shipyards. The system has now been operational for a few years. It was introduced in December 2001 to replace the previous Marine Safety Information System (MSIS).|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a GIS-based real-time system for emergency response {{and management of}} air pollution accidents in an urban area. The system architecture emphasises the integration of meteorological, chemical and GIS data, dispersion modeling, decision-making and geo-spatial visualization. The threat zones, unsafe areas and safe traffic routes are obtained using an improved Gaussian plume model with a decision-making module and then exported to the Google Earth browser via “kml” file format. Several simulation scenarios were conducted and verified for notable industrial sites in Montenegro using recorded meteorological data. The results demonstrate that emergency response authorities can use the proposed methodology and system as a cost effective and accurate support tool in case of industrial or <b>deliberate</b> air <b>pollution</b> incidents...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Deliberate or Intentional {{discharge}} of oil into the High Sea: It analyses the efficacy of laws and techniques used in detecting and combating the problem. It also compromises a comparative study between Norway and Tanzania. The objective {{of this research is}} to show that the high sea is vulnerable to <b>deliberate</b> oil <b>pollution</b> just like coastal waters or territorial waters and therefore it should be equally protected. This research also shows that the laws governing pollution in the high sea are not effective and hence have contributed to the vulnerability of the high sea. Chapter one describes the problem generally while taking into account what other authors or authorities have said about this problem of deliberate oil discharge into the high sea, critical analysis of the legal frame work has been discussed in chapter two, challenges of eradicating the problem of deliberate or intentional oil discharge in the selected countries has been analyzed in chapter three, while conclusion and recommendations of what should be done have been set out in chapter four...|$|R
40|$|Besides {{accidental}} pollution caused by ships in distress, {{different types of}} routine ship operations lead to deliberate discharges {{of oil in the}} sea. Illicit discharges are the greatest source of marine pollution from ships, and the one which poses a long-term threat to the marine and coastal environment. Reliable monitoring methodologies and continuously updated comprehensive information are key elements to create effective contingency planning. Satellite monitoring, in particular using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) observations, may represent an effective tool for complementing traditional aerial surveillance. The capability of SAR in detecting oil slicks over the sea surface is well known and proven since a long time. At the moment, a number of different factors have prevented the use of space-borne SAR as an operational and routine monitoring tool. They include concerns about the reliability, sustainability and cost effectiveness of a similar system. In this paper, the activities of the Joint Research Centre (JRC), devoted at supporting the operational use of space imagery in case of deliberate oil discharges as well as during emergencies due to large accidental oil spills, are presented. Concerning the operational pollution, a specific methodology for processing and interpreting a massive set of satellite images has been implemented with the ultimate goal of performing a systematic mapping of the possible illicit vessel discharges at continental scale. The results are stored and organized in a specific database, which is the starting point for further focused statistical assessment. Along with the presentation of the implemented methodology the achieved results for the East Mediterranean basin, covering the sea area between Egypt, Greece and Turkey are presented. The results collected so far are sufficient to demonstrate how the approach provides an extremely valuable source of information to assess on a solid observational basis the dimension of the operational oil pollution problem. The value of the approach is even higher in the areas, like East Mediterranean basin where a routine patrolling activity by aerial means is not executed. The activity may become a powerful tool for policy makers in order to verify the effectiveness of particular new actions and measures implemented to enhance the protection of the marine ecosystem against <b>deliberate</b> oil <b>pollution.</b> JRC.
