5000|$|Block-level integration: This style assigns entire design {{blocks to}} {{separate}} dies. Design blocks subsume {{most of the}} netlist connectivity and are linked by {{a small number of}} global interconnects. Therefore, block-level integration promises to reduce TSV overhead. Sophisticated 3D systems combining heterogeneous dies require distinct manufacturing processes at different technology nodes for fast and low-power random logic, several memory types, analog and RF circuits, etc. Block-level integration, which allows separate and optimized manufacturing processes, thus appears crucial for 3D integration. Furthermore, this style might facilitate the transition from current 2D design towards 3D IC design. Basically, 3D-aware tools are only needed for partitioning and thermal analysis. Separate dies will be designed using (adapted) 2D tools and 2D blocks. This is motivated by the broad availability of reliable <b>IP</b> <b>blocks.</b> It is more convenient to use available 2D <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> and to place the mandatory TSVs in the unoccupied space between blocks instead of redesigning <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> and embedding TSVs. Design-for-testability structures are a key component of <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> and can therefore be used to facilitate testing for 3D ICs. Also, critical paths can be mostly embedded within 2D blocks, which limits the impact of TSV and inter-die variation on manufacturing yield. Finally, modern chip design often requires last-minute engineering changes. Restricting the impact of such changes to single dies is essential to limit cost.|$|E

5000|$|Gate-level integration: This style {{partitions}} standard cells between multiple dies. It promises wirelength {{reduction and}} great flexibility. However, wirelength reduction may be undermined unless modules of certain minimal size are preserved. On the other hand, its adverse effects include the massive number of necessary TSVs for interconnects. This design style requires 3D place-and-route tools, which are unavailable yet. Also, partitioning a design block across multiple dies implies that it cannot be fully tested before die stacking. After die stacking (post-bond testing), a single failed die can render several good dies unusable, undermining yield.

40|$|Abstract — To {{deal with}} the {{increasing}} design complexity of integrated systems reuse of intellectual property (<b>IP)</b> <b>blocks</b> is promoted. A system architecture then becomes a composition of a heterogeneous set of such <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> together with a network that interconnects these blocks. The main challenge of system design therefore shifts from computation (<b>IP</b> <b>blocks)</b> to communication and storage (interconnect and memories). This means that applications become dynamic compositions of <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> which requires that the network is scalable (in the number of attached <b>IP</b> <b>blocks),</b> programmable and behaves predictably under the traffic offered by those blocks. As the feature size decreases the relative cost of wires increases. We therefore search for an interconnect network that efficiently uses wires through sharing by introducing routers. For a flexible and efficient solution at least two traffic classes must be support by the network, viz., guaranteedthroughput (GT) and best-effort (BE). For GT traffic communication channels are set up to transport data between <b>IP</b> <b>blocks</b> (possibly via memory). Best-effort traffic is never lost, but no latency or through-put guarantees are given. We also address the conflicting requirements of GT and BE traffic [1]. Our router is packet-switched and uses input-queuing with an efficient packet/flit scheduling [2] for BE traffic, whereas efficient time division multiplexing scheme is used is used for GT traffic. The focus {{of this paper is}} on the derivation of a costeffective router and network suitable for on-chip integration. I...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{power consumption}} {{due to the}} high integration rate of VLSI digital CMOS circuits {{has become a major}} concern. In order to reduce the power consumption in integrated circuits, low power techniques have to be applied {{at all levels of the}} design flow. Fast and accurate power estimation is needed early in the design process, since power reduction methods tend to become more visible at higher abstraction levels. Current approaches to power estimation, which concentrate on Register-Transfer-Level (RTL) or lower levels of abstraction, are quite slow. A simulation based System-level power estimation methodology has been developed at Philips [6]. It uses power estimation data obtained from the gate-level description of a predesigned Intellectual Property (<b>IP)</b> <b>block</b> by propagating a set of representative input stimuli to the <b>IP</b> <b>block.</b> This power estimation data is then annotated to the system-level model, which is parameterizable and executable.
