30|$|Additionally, {{in order}} to {{statistically}} analyse the selection process of the additives, one-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>analysis</b> was carried out. In one-way <b>ANOVA</b> <b>analysis</b> for all the groups (p value < 0.01) F is also less than F critical, meaning that the design is significantly different.

BSA was significantly different from all the other groups. SDS differs significantly with BSA and no-additive, but there is no significant difference with heptane.

40|$|ABSTRACT: This article {{discusses}} {{the use of}} Taguchi’s method and Pareto <b>ANOVA</b> <b>analysis</b> for optimizing the cutting parameters in turning glass fiber reinforced plastic (GFRP) composites using a poly crystalline diamond (PCD) tool for minimizing surface roughness. The cutting parameters evaluated are cutting speed, feed rate, and depth of cut. An L 27 orthogonal array, signal to noise ratio, and Pareto <b>ANOVA</b> <b>analysis</b> are {{used to analyze the}} effect of cutting parameters and its interactions. The experimental results suggest that the most significant process parameter is feed rate followed by cutting speed. The study shows that the Taguchi method and Pareto ANOVA are suitable for optimizing the cutting parameters with the minimum number of trials...|$|R
