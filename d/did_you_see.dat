5|$|Both yes–no {{questions}} and wh-questions in English are mostly formed using subject–auxiliary inversion (Am I going tomorrow?, Where can we eat?), which may require do-support (Do you like her?, Where did he go?). In most cases, interrogative words (wh-words; e.g. what, who, where, when, why, how) {{appear in a}} fronted position. For example, in the question What <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see?,</b> the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. (When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: Who saw the cat?.) Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. To whose house did you go last night?. The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.|$|E

500|$|During an {{appearance}} on Top of the Pops, Morrissey appeared waving gladioli. A 2004 BBC Radio 2 feature on the song noted that the performance was most people's introduction to The Smiths and, [...] "therefore, to the weird, wordy world of Morrissey and the music of Johnny Marr". Uncut magazine, commentating on the nationally televised debut, wrote that [...] "Thursday evening when Manchester's feyest first appeared on Top of the Pops would be an unexpected pivotal cultural event {{in the lives of}} a million serious English boys. His very English, camp glumness was a revolt into Sixties kitchen-sink greyness against the gaudiness of the Eighties new wave music, as exemplified by Culture Club and their ilk. The Smiths' subject matter may have been 'squalid' but there was a purity of purpose about them that you messed with at your peril." [...] Noel Gallagher said of the performance: [...] "None of my mates liked them — they were more hooligan types. They came into work and said 'Fuckin' hell, <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> that poof on [...] "Top of the Pops" [...] with the bush in his back pocket?' But I thought it was life-changing." ...|$|E
500|$|Edge of Darkness was {{promoted}} {{on the cover}} of the listings magazine Radio Times and was broadcast on Monday nights on BBC2 at 9:30pm, beginning 4 November 1985. The serial averaged an audience of 4 million viewers over its run. The critical response was generally positive with most commentators concentrating their praise on Peck's performance as Craven and the scale of the programme's political themes. “A good television thriller is very hard to find but Edge of Darkness promises to be one of the best”, wrote Celia Brayfield in The Times, “The central character is played by Bob Peck, who has the gift of looking tragic and intelligent simultaneously. [...] There was humour to lift the gloom and superb characterisation to flesh out the stock situation”. [...] Ruth Baumgarten, in The Listener, praised the serial as “a grandiosely ambitious and compelling piece of fiction”. Speaking on the BBC's review programme <b>Did</b> <b>You</b> <b>See...?,</b> the writer Sarah Dunant said, “this is a very classy piece of television drama, on all levels, I think on the plot level, I think on the level of emotion and I think stylistically [...] it looks absolutely wonderful, it's shot like a feature film”. Not so impressed was Byron Rogers, television critic of The Sunday Times, who initially hailed the series as one that “stayed in the mind and will stay there long [...] because of its portrayal of human grief” but later felt he was “beginning to find Edge of Darkness slightly irritating” and decried the final episode as “an insult to its considerable following”.|$|E
500|$|Brashear {{played in}} 79 games the {{following}} season, registering 19 assists and 28 points. After leading the Canucks in penalty {{minutes for the}} previous four seasons, Brashear was traded 31 games into the 2001–02 season to the Philadelphia Flyers. The Flyers received Brashear and the Canucks' sixth-round draft pick in 2002 in exchange for Jan Hlaváč and the Flyers' third-round pick in the same draft. While splitting time between the two franchises, Brashear set a career-high in points (32) while also amassing 199 PIMs. In 2002–03, he recorded eight goals, 25 points and 161 PIMs. Thanks in part to his strong work ethic, {{he was awarded the}} Pelle Lindbergh Memorial Trophy, an annual award given to the Flyers' most improved player. During the 2003–04 season, he was among the League leaders in PIMs, registering 212, ranking him fifth overall. His PIM total was aided by his role in the most penalized game in NHL history. On March 5, 2004, the Flyers were defeating the Ottawa Senators 5–2, when with 1:45 remaining in the game, Brashear fought Ottawa enforcer Rob Ray. The fight was believed to be in retaliation to Flyers forward Mark Recchi being slashed in the face by the Senators Martin Havlát. Following Brashear's fight, five separate brawls broke out. For his role in starting the fighting, Brashear was assessed 34 PIMs, more than any other Flyer. When asked later why he started the fighting, he responded by saying, [...] "Why wouldn’t I? <b>Did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> the last game?" ...|$|E

500|$|Filmed in Los Angeles, {{the music}} video reunited Carey with Paul Hunter, {{director}} of the video for her 1997 single, [...] "Honey". Since its release, Carey claimed it {{to be one of}} her favorite videos, due to its complex scenery and fun nature. She explained that she had wanted to work with Hunter again for some time, and was happy to be able to film another music video alongside him. In an interview with MTV News, Carey described her feelings regarding the video, as well as sentiments towards the video's director, Hunter: [...] "But I was so happy to work with him again 'cause ever since 'Honey' I've been trying to relive the splendor of that moment. It's more of just a plain beauty piece with sentimental overtones, but it was great to work with Paul again." [...] Following a tale of love and separation, the video alternates between two different time frames. The first of these involves a tearful Carey in the present, while the second invokes memories of a relationship with a former lover (played by Dolce & Gabbana model Christian Monzon). When questioned regarding a possible relationship with Monzon, Carey said [...] "Erm, how do we play this? OK, he’s a very nice guy, he's been in a fabulous Dolce & Gabbana advert - <b>did</b> <b>you</b> <b>see</b> it? And we’ve had some nice conversations and, um, a nice time. OK, I'll say he definitely {{did a very good job}} in the video." [...] Additionally, Carey and Hunter placed several secrets within the video's scenery, that would be intended for the [...] "die-hard fans". Following the video's completion, it premiered on MTV and several other music video channels on November 1, 2005. Aside from the video's script, Carey channeled Marilyn Monroe, one of her icons growing up. During a pool scene, Carey re-enacts a part from Monroe's film Something's Got to Give (1962).
