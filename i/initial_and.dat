5|$|On Her Majesty's Secret Service is {{the tenth}} novel in Ian Fleming's James Bond series, first {{published}} in the UK by Jonathan Cape on 1 April 1963. The <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> secondary print runs sold out, with over 60,000 books sold in the first month. Fleming wrote the book in Jamaica whilst the first film in the Eon Productions series of films, Dr. No, was being filmed nearby.|$|E
5|$|Classical Nahuatl {{and most}} of the modern {{varieties}} have fairly simple phonological systems. They allow only syllables with maximally one <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> one final consonant. Consonant clusters occur only word-medially and over syllable boundaries. Some morphemes have two alternating forms: one with a vowel i to prevent consonant clusters and one without it. For example, the absolutive suffix has the variant forms -tli (used after consonants) and -tl (used after vowels). Some modern varieties, however, have formed complex clusters from vowel loss. Others have contracted syllable sequences, causing accents to shift or vowels to become long.|$|E
5|$|Forest Hill {{was a new}} air base, {{and roads}} and {{buildings}} were still under construction when its first course of flying training commenced with Avro Ansons on 29July 1940. One of the Ansons crashed in August, killing its instructor and a student. Later that month the second flying course began, on CAC Wirraways. The school was then reorganised into <b>Initial</b> <b>and</b> Advanced Squadrons. On 29September, two Ansons collided in mid-air and became locked together. Both navigators bailed out, to be followed shortly afterwards by the injured pilot of the lower aircraft. The pilot of the upper Anson, however, {{found that he was}} able to control the interlocked aircraft using his ailerons and flaps, coupled with the engine power of the Anson underneath. He then managed to make a successful emergency landing in a paddock near the town of Brocklesby.|$|E
50|$|During communism, {{plates of}} trucks would be painted upon {{on the sides}} with {{district}} name <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> a five digit serial number (in 1991 two digits followed with district name <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> three digits). State vehicles bared a white plate with the communist red star, district <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> serial number in black or white. Once private ownership was re-established {{after the fall of}} Communism, a new format with standard size was introduced similar to the post 1993 model but with different font and missing national identification strip.|$|R
40|$|Standard {{particle}} swarm optimization cannot guarantee convergence to {{the global}} optimum in multi-modal search spaces, so multiple swarms can be useful. The multiple swarms all need <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> <b>initial</b> velocities for their particles. Several simple strategies to select <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> <b>initial</b> velocities are presented. A series of experiments isolates {{the effects of these}} selected <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> velocities compared to random <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> velocities. A first set of experiments shows how locust swarms benefit from 'scouting' for <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> the use of initial velocities that 'launch away' from the previous optimum. A second set of experiments show that the performance of WoSP (Waves of Swarm Particles) can be improved by using new search strategies to select the <b>initial</b> positions <b>and</b> <b>initial</b> velocities for the particles in its sub-swarms...|$|R

5|$|In 1925, Born and Heisenberg {{formulated}} {{the matrix}} mechanics representation of quantum mechanics. On 9 July, Heisenberg gave Born a paper entitled Über quantentheoretische Umdeutung kinematischer und mechanischer Beziehungen ("Quantum-Theoretical Re-interpretation of Kinematic and Mechanical Relations") to review, and submit for publication. In the paper, Heisenberg formulated quantum theory, avoiding the concrete, but unobservable, representations of electron orbits by using parameters such as transition probabilities for quantum jumps, which necessitated using two indexes {{corresponding to the}} <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> final states. When Born read the paper, he recognized the formulation as one which could be transcribed and extended to the systematic language of matrices, which he had learned from his study under Jakob Rosanes at Breslau University.|$|E
5|$|Stations {{are divided}} into two areas, paid and unpaid, which allow the rail {{operators}} to collect fares by restricting entry only through the fare gates, also known as access control gates. These gates, connected to a computer network, can read and update electronic tickets capable of storing data, and can store information such as the <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> destination stations and the duration for each trip. General Ticketing Machines sell tickets for single trips or allow the customer to buy additional value for stored-value tickets. Tickets for single trips, coloured in green, are valid only {{on the day of}} purchase, and have a time allowance of 30 minutes beyond the estimated travelling time. Tickets that can be used repeatedly until their expiry date require a minimum amount of stored credit.|$|E
5|$|Stieger, Voracek, and Formann {{recommend}} that the task be administered twice, that the effects be calculated separately for first-name <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> last-name initial, that the task be accompanied with the birthday-number task, and that the instructions focus on liking rather than attractiveness. They suggest {{it may be useful}} to use not just initials but all name letters for measuring implicit self-esteem, something which Hoorens says is her most important recommendation. The Letter Preference Task has been used to measure implicit self-esteem in contexts as diverse as depression, physical health, social acceptance, unrealistic optimism, feedback sensitivity, self-regulation, and defensiveness.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} aims at {{investigating}} {{the categories of}} the zhao-series initials of Middle Chinese. Particularly, the present study tries to examine whether the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging {{to one or two}} groups of initials, using both dialectal and historical data. The first part of the thesis is an overview on what is being said about the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in previous studies. The second part of the thesis discusses the merge and the split of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> the zhang-group <b>initials</b> based on their historical development and in conjunction with ancient Chinese and Modern Chinese Phonology. The third part of the thesis uses the data of the distribution of the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> the zhang-group <b>initials</b> in present day Northern Mandarin to discuss the categories of these two groups of initials in Middle Chinese. Combining the observations made from both dialectal data and historical studies, the conclusion of the present study is that the zhuang-group <b>initials</b> <b>and</b> the zhang-group <b>initials</b> should be considered belonging to two different groups of initials, which will be the fourth part of the thesis...|$|R
5|$|The design {{challenges}} the Navy's Bureau of Construction and Repair (C) {{faced with this}} class were considerable, as the combined requirements of optimum hitting power, extreme speed and adequate protection taxed the knowledge of its naval architects and technology of the time. The desired speed of 35knots, for example, had been previously attained only in destroyers and smaller craft. To do so with a capital ship required a hull and a power plant of unprecedented size for a U.S. naval vessel, in addition to careful planning by its designers to ensure it would have enough longitudinal strength to withstand both bending forces while underway and any stress that might occur in combat. It took years between <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> final designs for engine and boiler technology to provide a plant of sufficient power that was also compact enough to allow a practical degree of protection, even in such large ships.|$|E
5|$|The {{inner product}} between two state vectors {{is a complex}} number known as a {{probability}} amplitude. During an ideal measurement of a quantum mechanical system, {{the probability that a}} system collapses from a given initial state to a particular eigenstate is given by the square of the absolute value of the probability amplitudes between the <b>initial</b> <b>and</b> final states. The possible results of a measurement are the eigenvalues of the operator—which explains the choice of self-adjoint operators, for all the eigenvalues must be real. The probability distribution of an observable in a given state can be found by computing the spectral decomposition of the corresponding operator.|$|E
