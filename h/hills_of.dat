5|$|Brigadier General J.F.K.

P.atriplicifolia was the Perennial Plant Association's 1995 Plant of the Year, and the 'Blue Spire' cultivar received the Award of Garden Merit from the Royal Horticultural Society.|$|E

40|$|This {{feasibility}} study explored {{the potential for}} a deep geothermal heat project at <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Banchory, Aberdeenshire. The geology <b>of</b> the <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Fare, to the north of Banchory, gives cause to believe it has good geothermal potential, while the <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Banchory heat network, situated on the northern side of the town, offers a ready-made heat customer. The partners in the consortium consisted of academics and developers with relevant expertise in deep geothermal energy, heat networks, and financial analysis, together with representatives of local Government. They conducted geological fieldwork around the <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Fare, engaged with local residents to establish their attitudes to geothermal energy, and built business models to predict the conditions under which the heat network at <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Banchory would be commercial if it utilised heat from the proposed geothermal well. They also estimated the potential carbon emission reductions that could be achieved by using deep geothermal energy, both at <b>Hill</b> <b>of</b> Banchory and more widely...|$|R
