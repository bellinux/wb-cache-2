40|$|Affective {{states can}} change how people react to {{measures}} aimed at influencing their decisions such as providing a default option. Previous {{research has shown}} that when <b>defaults</b> maintain the <b>status</b> quo positive mood increases reliance on the default and negative mood decreases it. Similarly, it has been demonstrated that positive mood enhances the preference for inaction. We extend this research by investigating how mood states influence reliance on the default if the default leads to a change, thus pitting preference for status quo against a preference for inaction. Specifically, we tested in an online study how happiness and sadness influenced reliance on two types of default (1) a <b>default</b> maintaining <b>status</b> quo and (2) a default inducing change. Our results suggest that the effect of emotions depends on the type of default: people in a happy mood were more likely than sad people to follow a default when it maintained status quo but less likely to follow a default when it introduced change.

50|$|For U.S. {{federal income}} tax purposes, an LLC is treated by default as a {{pass-through}} entity. If {{there is only one}} member in the company, the LLC is treated as a “disregarded entity” for tax purposes, and an individual owner would report the LLC's income or loss on Schedule C of his or her individual tax return. Thus, income from the LLC is taxed at the individual tax rates. The <b>default</b> tax <b>status</b> for LLCs with multiple members is as a partnership, which is required to report income and loss on IRS Form 1065. Under partnership tax treatment, each member of the LLC, as is the case for all partners of a partnership, annually receives a Form K-1 reporting the member's distributive share of the LLC's income or loss that is then reported on the member's individual income tax return. On the other hand, income from corporations is taxed twice, once at the corporate entity level and again when distributed to shareholders, thus more tax savings often result if a business formed as an LLC rather than a corporation.|$|R

40|$|How robust {{are social}} {{preferences}} to {{variations in the}} environment in which a decision is made? By varying the elicitation method and default choice in the `moral wiggle-room' game of Dana, Weber, and Kuang (2007), I examine the robustness and nature of the pattern of information avoidance in which many dictators in experiments [...] if initially uncertain [...] avoid learning whether their choice will help or hurt another person and choose selfishly. When ignorance is not the default choice, participants choose it much less frequently. However, when dictators express their outcome choice using the strategy method, most are willing to overcome the default choice and reveal the payoff state ex post. I conclude that people will employ strategic ignorance to avoid a morally-fraught decision if they can do so passively, but having to actively choose ignorance betrays its usefulness and leads to behavior largely consistent with models of preferences over outcomes. Thus while opportunities to create and exploit moral wiggle-room limit fair-minded behavior, environmental or psychological variables may reinforce the motivation that leads people to choose fair outcomes. social preferences, strategic ignorance, moral wiggle-room, <b>default</b> effects, <b>status</b> quo bias, self- deception, self-signaling, dictator games, Behavioral Economics, Other Economics...|$|R
40|$|What is {{the role}} of {{pragmatics}} in the evolution of grammatical paradigms? It is to maintain marked candidates that may come to be the default expression. This perspective is validated by the Jespersen cycle, where the standard expression of sentential negation is renewed as pragmatically marked negatives achieve <b>default</b> <b>status.</b> How status changes are effected, however, remains to be documented. This is what is achieved in this paper that looks at the evolution of preverbal negative non in Old and Middle French. The negative, which categorically marks pragmatic activation (Dryer 1996) with finite verbs in Old French, loses this value when used with non-finite verbs in Middle French. This process is accompanied by competing semantic reanalyses of the distribution of infinitives negated in this way, and by the co-occurrence with a greater lexical variety of verbs. The absence of pragmatic contribution should lead the marker to take on the role of default, which is already fulfilled by a well-established ne [...] . pas, pushing non to decline. Hard empirical evidence is thus provided that validates the assumed role of pragmatics in the Jespersen cycle, supporting the general view of pragmatics as supporting alternative candidates {{that may or may not}} achieve <b>default</b> <b>status</b> in the evolution of a grammatical paradigm...|$|E
40|$|The {{standard}} view in epistemology is that propositional knowledge entails belief.

Against the entailment thesis, Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel (forthcoming) report that a non trivial {{percentage of people}} think that there can be propositional knowledge without belief. In this paper, we add further fuel to the fire, presenting the results of four new studies. Based on our results, we argue that the entailment thesis does not deserve the <b>default</b> <b>status</b> that it is typically granted. We conclude by considering the alternative account of knowledge that Myers-Schulz and Schwitzgebel propose to explain their results, arguing that it does not explain ours. In its place we offer a different explanation of both sets of findings—the conviction account, according to which belief, but not knowledge, requires mental assent. Few claims in philosophy are as widely held as that propositional knowledge entails belief. Certainly, this entailment thesis is the standard view in contemporary epistemology. 2 But why?

40|$|This chapter {{demonstrates}} how biases produced by verbal comparisons (Choplin & Hummel, 2002) might produce {{a variety of}} phenomena in the psychology of judgment and decision making. The biases produced by verbal comparisons cause people to overestimate the importance of small differences and underestimate the importance of large differences. Simulations will demonstrate that overestimating the importance of small differences and underestimating the importance of large differences from a reference point (<b>default</b> value, <b>status</b> quo, etc.) would produce s-shaped evaluation functions. Simulations will also demonstrate that overestimating the importance of small differences and underestimating the importance of large differences from other contextual stimuli would produce distribution-density effects (often called frequency effects). Because large differences are underestimated, when the variance in people’s unbiased estimates is large as in anchoring effects, these biases will often look like assimilation effects. Biases produced by verbalized social comparisons would also overestimate the importance of small differences and underestimate the importance of large differences so that moderate downward comparisons will produce higher evaluations of the self than will extreme downward comparisons and moderate upward comparisons will produce lower evaluations of the self than will extreme upward comparisons. Comparison strategies might also help explain decoy effects such as asymmetric dominance effects and phantom decoy effects.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{phosphorylase}} kinase in skeletal muscle is exquisitely sensitive to developmental signals such as differentiation and innervation, and is clearly regulated {{in such a}} manner so as to always maintain the gamma catalytic subunit under the control of its regulatory alpha, beta and gamma subunits. To identify how the transcription of the gamma subunit is regulated, we have analysed 3. 8 kb of the upstream regulatory region using a luciferase reporter system. A complex sequence of interdependent regulations is evident. The gamma catalytic subunit gene contains two inhibitory controls with very dominant features. Also evident are an array of multiple positive regulatory elements, prominent amongst which are four E-boxes, of which two are downstream, one is upstream and one {{is in the middle of}} the CAAT-TATA core promoter. Differentiation-dependent positive regulation arises as a consequence of both E-box regulation and the activation of at least one other regulatory element. The primary mode of transcriptional regulation of the gamma catalytic subunit gene appears to occur by the relief of regulation of an otherwise <b>default</b> inhibitory <b>status.</b> It is noteworthy that such a mode of regulation mirrors the regulation of the enzymic activity of many protein kinases, including phosphorylase kinase. With phosphorylase kinase, both its transcriptional regulation as well as the regulation of the protein itself, are primed to maintain the gamma catalytic subunit either unexpressed or inactivate respectively, until a positive signal occurs to override an otherwise dominant default inhibitory condition...|$|R
