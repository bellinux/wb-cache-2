40|$|By the aid {{of glass}} {{electrodes}} changes of medium pH were determined during glucose metabolism according to the combinations of various concentrations of phosphate buffer, glucose, and bacteria, using such resting cells as E. coli, Aerobacter aerogenes, Sal. typhi 57 S and 57 R, Sal. paratyphi A and B, Staphylococcus aureus, albus and citreus, and further the volumes of more important acids produced at <b>differnet</b> <b>time</b> measured. Next, the relationships between these volumes and “time-pH” curve were studied; and the following are the conclusions arrived at. 1. "Time-pH" curves {{in the case of}} E. coli present moderate descent on the whole whereas in the case of A. aerogenes they were steep; and the production of acetoin and lactic acid is very much but that of α-ketoglutaric acid lesser {{in the case of the}} latter. 2. In the cases of Sal. typhi 57 S and 57 R, the fall of pH in the former is steeper than that of the latter, and the production of lactic acid has been alomst twice that of the latter. 3. Of the bacteria tested, Sal. paratyphi A and Sal. paratyphi B was steep in the fall of pH and the production of lactic acid was greater though that of pyruvic acid is small. 4. The rates of fall of pH are greater in the order of St. aureus, St. albus and St. citreus; and St. aureus is influenced quite sensitively by the concentrations of phosphate buffer and glucose. Moreover, these changes in concentrations alter the order mentioned above. 5. Main cause of the fall of pH in the case of the test bacteria seems to be lactic acid followed by pyruvic acid...|$|E

Various samples of quartz sheres {{were used for}} methodical studies investigating the SANS effects. The Porod's potential law holds for both powder samples of quartz spheres. In the measured Omega-region the hardening cement paste does not show a Porod-like behaviour of SANS curves. By observing the shape of scattering curves taken at <b>differnet</b> <b>times</b> after the onset of hydration within the first 92 days, some evolution of the inner structure in the hardened cement paste can be noted. Furthermore foils of the PETP type were investigated by SANS. The irradiated foils show a Guinier-like region on the scattering curve. The measured radius of gyration is of about 8 nm. By annealing (at 160 degree Centigrade) the radius of gyration is reduced...|$|R
