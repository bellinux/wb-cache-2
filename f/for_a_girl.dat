5|$|A casting {{call was}} {{announced}} by Suresh Productions for {{the roles of}} Venkatesh's daughters in the film. They were looking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> aged 14–17 years {{to play the role}} of the elder daughter named Anjali, and another aged 8–12 years to play her younger sibling, Anu. Esther Anil was confirmed to reprise her role as the younger sister. Kruthika Jayakumar, a 17-year-old science student from Bangalore, was selected {{to play the role of}} elder sister in the film. This happened when a Malayalam filmmaker visited her dance performance in Thiruvananthapuram, and was struck by her expressions and photogenic features. He suggested that she pursue a career in the film industry. She referred to her character as a simple and vulnerable girl, who gets exploited. Her family is her world and she is particularly attached to her father. Kalabhavan Shajon was initially reported to reprise his role of a corrupt police officer from the original, but Ravi Kale was chosen instead.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, Beyoncé Knowles met rapper LaTavia Roberson while auditioning <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> group. Based in Houston, Texas, {{they were}} joined to a group that {{performed}} rapping and dancing. Kelly Rowland, who relocated to Knowles' house because of family issues, joined them in 1992. Originally named Girl's Tyme, they were eventually cut down to six members including Támar Davis and sisters Nikki and Nina Taylor. With Knowles and Rowland, Girl's Tyme attracted nationwide attention: west-coast R producer Arne Frager flew to Houston to see them. He brought them to his studio, The Plant Recording Studios, in Northern California, with focus on Knowles' vocals because Frager thought she had personality {{and the ability to}} sing. With efforts to sign Girl's Tyme to a major record deal, Frager's strategy was to debut the group in Star Search, the biggest talent show on national TV at the time. However, they lost the competition because, according to Knowles, their choice of song was wrong; they were actually rapping instead of singing.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} two episodes, it is {{revealed}} that Wirt and Greg are actually two boys from the modern era. Wirt and Greg's strange appearance {{stems from the fact}} that the night they entered the Unknown was Halloween. Wirt, attempting to take back an embarrassing poetry tape he made <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> he likes, had followed her to a graveyard scary story gathering before a police officer scared him and Greg into jumping over the cemetery's garden wall. On the other side of the wall, they landed on train tracks where Greg was almost hit by a train. Wirt pushed them both off a hill into a lake/river in an attempt to save him, knocking them both unconscious in the process and sending them to a Limbo-like realm between life and death.|$|E

5|$|Numerous fady protect {{wilderness}} areas, particularly {{including the}} Ankarana massif. Excessive cutting of mangrove trees for wood or {{the setting of}} bush fires are both prohibited, as {{is the use of}} nets with holes less than 15 millimeters to prevent catching immature fish. Certain species are protected through fady that forbid hunting them, including sharks, rays and crocodiles. Many fady also exist to regulate relations between the sexes. For instance, it is taboo <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> to wash her own brother's clothing. Conservative communities adhere to a fady against medical injections, surgery or modern medicines due to their association with their historic enemies the Merina, who were the first to use them widely; instead, tromba ceremonies and traditional herbal remedies are commonly used for healing. These taboos are most strongly applied in the center of Antankarana territory around the village of Ambatoharaña and less so in the villages at the periphery of the region.|$|E

The family was initially well off, but {{by the time she was}} of school age poor financial management had substantially reduced her father's income and she attended a public school from the ages of 6 to 17—this was, nevertheless, a fairly extensive education <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> of the period.|$|E
25|$|Denaro had shoulder-length hair, {{and police}} later {{speculated that the}} shooter had mistaken him <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl.</b> Keenan's father was a 20-year veteran police detective of the NYPD, causing an intense investigation.

Many details of the Denaro–Keenan shooting were {{very similar to the}} Lauria–Valenti case, but police did not initially associate them, partly because the shootings occurred in different boroughs and were investigated by different local police precincts.|$|E

25|$|Mercy Burdett Money-Coutts {{was born}} on 16 April 1910 in Devon into an upper-class family, the only {{daughter}} of Hester Frances née Russell and Hugh Burdett Money-Coutts, later Baron Latymer. Unsurprisingly <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> of her background, she was privately educated at home and presented at court before going to Lady Margaret Hall at Oxford University, and she entered enthusiastically into traditional English field sports. This background developed certain qualities helpful to her later work in archaeology. As well as being well-read and skilled in drawing, she built up physical stamina while deer stalking.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, various {{evidence}} {{suggest that}} certain household differences affecting how {{a child is}} raised can influence how similar (or different) a child is to the opposite sex, therefore how “feminine” or “masculine” the child can potentially become. For instance, as certain research demonstrates, {{in the absence of}} a father figure boys are generally more “feminine” than those living with a father. This demonstrates the significance of father-son modeling. The same research reveals that boyhood femininity is more strongly correlated with parental reinforcement such as a father or mother’s desire <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> and/or their approval for feminine behaviours.|$|E

25|$|The Rev Herbert Kynaston Hudson, vicar from 1899 to 1937, reintroduced {{the miracle}} play and {{ceremony}} of the ‘Boy Bishop’, {{based on a}} 15th-century tradition. A boy would take the role of bishop, central to the event celebrating the life of Saint Nicholas, and would hold the 'office' for the year. Hudson set up in 1901 the 'Guild of St Nicholas' for both boys and girls, this to organize the event and elect the 'bishop'. The event was again revived in 1956-57 and between 1961 and 1966. An equivalent election was <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> as the ‘May Queen’, who was accompanied by the Boy Bishop and the vicar {{to the top of}} the church tower on May Day. Film units from British-Pathé and Gaumont British recorded and screened Berden's Boy Bishop ceremony.|$|E
25|$|Due {{to their}} carrion diet, the Celtic peoples {{strongly}} associated corvids with war, {{death and the}} battlefield – their great intelligence meant that they were often considered messengers, or manifestations of the gods such Bendigeidfran Blessed raven or the Irish Morrigan, underworld deities that {{may be related to}} the later Arthurian Fisher King. The Welsh Dream of Rhonabwy illustrates well the association of ravens with war. In many parts of Britain, gatherings of crows, or more often magpies, are counted using the divination rhyme: one for sorrow, two for joy, three <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl,</b> four for a boy, five for silver six for gold, seven for a secret never to be told. Cornish superstition holds that when a lone magpie is encountered, it must be loudly greeted with respect.|$|E
25|$|On 16 October 1843, Kierkegaard {{published}} {{three more}} books {{about love and}} faith and several more discourses. Fear and Trembling was published under the pseudonym Johannes de Silentio. Repetition is about a Young Man (Søren Kierkegaard) who has anxiety and depression because he feels he has to sacrifice his love <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>girl</b> (Regine Olsen) to God. He tries {{to see if the}} new science of psychology can help him understand himself. Constantin Constantius, who is the pseudonymous author of that book, is the psychologist. At the same time, he published Three Upbuilding Discourses, 1843 under his own name, which dealt specifically with how love can be used to hide things from yourself or others. These three books, all published on the same day, are an example of Kierkegaard's method of indirect communication.|$|E
