25|$|Vijayalaya Chola was {{probably}} a Pallava vassal. Vijayalaya captured Thanjavur in 848, making use of the opportunity during a war between Pandyas and Pallavas. The Cholas under Aditya I captured the Pallavas in the north (c. 869) and subdued the Pandayas and Cheras in the south (c. 903). Parantaka <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> the Pandayas out of their territories and captured Sri Lanka in 910. Rashtrakutas and Gangas in the north posed {{the biggest threat to}} the nascent Chola Empire and the Chola prince Rajaditya was killed in the battle of Thakkolam in 949. Parantaka had a long reign, and when he died in 950 his second son Gandaraditya became king. The Chola throne went to Gandaraditya's younger brother Arinjaya briefly before Arinjaya's son Sundara Chola took the reins of the kingdom overlooking the claims of Uttama Chola, son of Gandaraditya.|$|E

500|$|In Europe in the 1990s, a {{successful}} driver would usually progress from Formula Three either directly to Formula One, {{the pinnacle of}} the sport, or to the International Formula 3000 championship. However, Hill {{did not have enough}} sponsorship available to fund a drive in F3000. He says [...] "I ended up having to reappraise my career a bit. The first thing was to realise how lucky I was to be driving anything. I made the decision that whatever <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> I would do it {{to the best of my}} ability and see where it led." [...] He took a one-off drive in the lower level British F3000 championship and shared a Porsche 962 at Le Mans for Richard Lloyd Racing, where the engine failed after 228laps. He also competed in one race in the British Touring Car Championship at Donington Park, driving a Ford Sierra RS500. Midway through the season, an opportunity arose at the uncompetitive Mooncraft F3000 team. The team tested Hill and Perry McCarthy. Their performances were comparable but according to the team manager, John Wickham, the team sponsors preferred the Hill name. Although his best result was a 15th place, Hill's race performances for Mooncraft led to an offer to drive a Lola chassis for Middlebridge Racing in 1990. He took three pole positions and led five races in 1990, but did not win a race during his Formula 3000 career.|$|E

[...] Clarkson also positively referred to the benefit of a hybrid car being exempt from the London congestion charge (for a £10 one off administration fee to register it). In 2009, the GS 450h received a new hybrid-only grille and refreshing.|$|E

LaGuardia High School of Music & Art and Performing Arts, where she joined the school's drama society. Anthony Abeson was her drama teacher. She played The Sign in Sidney Brustein's Window by Lorraine Hansberry and Three Sisters by Anton Chekhov. In 2015, she spoke about a childhood incident that led to her lifelong fear of water. She stated during a special event for her film Cake, [...] "I basically have a real fear of going underwater. I was a kid and I was riding this tricycle around a swimming pool and <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> my tricycle into the swimming pool and I didn't let go and my brother tried to (help).

2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America.

And <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, I thought I knew what the world was like, I thought I knew what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E

2500|$|When Chandler came to {{work with}} Wilder he was already a {{recovering}} alcoholic. As Wilder noted, [...] "He was in Alcoholics Anonymous, and I {{think he had a}} tough time with me – <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> him back into drinking..." [...] By the time the picture was released, Chandler was thoroughly disillusioned with the writers' lot in Hollywood; he published an angry piece titled [...] "Writers in Hollywood" [...] for The Atlantic Monthly in November 1945 in which he complained: [...] "The first picture I worked on was nominated for an Academy Award (if that means anything), but I was not even invited to the press review held right in the studio." [...] He neglected, however, to mention that the studio had kept him on salary during the eight-week shooting schedule and that no changes to the script were allowed without his approval – a very rare accommodation for screenwriters, particularly newcomers, in those days. Offended, Wilder responded by saying, [...] "We didn't invite him? How could we? He was under the table drunk at Lucy's," [...] a nearby watering hole for Paramount employees. This relationship with Chandler is what drew Wilder to his next project, the Best Picture-winning The Lost Weekend, about an alcoholic writer. Wilder made the film, in part, [...] "to explain Chandler to himself." ...|$|E
2500|$|The chain {{also has}} fans {{in a number}} of renowned chefs {{including}} Gordon Ramsay, Thomas Keller, Julia Child, Anthony Bourdain, and Mario Batali. Famous London chef/restaurateur Ramsay ate In-N-Out for the first time when taping [...] Hell's Kitchen in Los Angeles, and it soon became one of his favorite spots for take-out. Ramsay was quoted, saying about the experience: [...] "In-N-Out burgers were extraordinary. I was so bad, I sat in the restaurant, had my double cheeseburger then minutes later <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> back round and got the same thing again to take away." [...] Thomas Keller, a fan of In-N-out, celebrated with In-N-Out burgers at the anniversary party of his restaurant, The French Laundry. Keller also plans on opening his own burger restaurant inspired by his Los Angeles experience of In-N-Out. Julia Child, one of the first celebrities to champion the chain, admitted to knowing every location of the restaurant between Santa Barbara and San Francisco. Child also had the burgers delivered to her during a hospital stay. Anthony Bourdain reportedly said that In-N-Out was his favorite fast food meal; later naming the restaurant as [...] "the best restaurant in Los Angeles." [...] In-N-Out was {{one of the very few}} restaurant chains given a positive mention in the book Fast Food Nation. The book commended the chain for using natural and fresh ingredients and for looking after the interests of employees regarding pay and benefits. An In-N-Out food truck catered Vanity Fairs 2012 Academy Awards after party.|$|E
2500|$|For {{the first}} time in the series Richie Benaud won the toss and took the unusual step of putting England into bat, but he had four fast bowlers in his team and wanted to use them in the humid, {{swinging}} conditions. In the second over Ray Lindwall's first ball swung away and Trevor Bailey was caught first ball by Alan Davidson in third slip to give him his 216th Test wicket and equal Clarrie Grimmett's Australian record. Just before the Test Bailey had given a talk to the inmates of HMP Pentridge and had been asked if he had ever been out first ball in a Test match. He said he had not, but retained his sense of humour as he ordered roast duck for dinner after his dismissal. Peter May fell to Meckiff and England were 13/2, but Peter Richardson made a dogged 68 by forgoing his favourate deflections through the slips which had cost his wicket so many times. He added 48 with Colin Cowdrey (22) and 48 again with Tom Graveney (19), taking the score to 109/3. Tom Graveney was dismissed by Benaud; [...] "I remember him getting me out in the 1958–59 Melbourne Test by attacking my leg stump. He bowled me two half-volleys, the first of which <b>I</b> <b>drove</b> hard to Colin McDonald at mid-on. The second was just a fraction slower, and I was committed to the stroke before I spotted it. McDonald held the catch and the critics put it down to another casual shot from Graveney. They did not seem to notice the crafty part that Benaud had played in my dismissal". Ted Dexter was out first ball to Meckiff (2/57), Roy Swetman for 1 off Davidson and Richardson was caught and bowled by Benaud to leave England 128/7. Debutant John Mortimore showed his all round skills with an unbeaten 44, adding 63 with Fred Trueman (21) before Benaud (4/43) and Davidson (3/38) finished off the innings for 205 early on the second day.|$|E
