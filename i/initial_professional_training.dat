Whereas changes in mining technology and operations accelerate to improve productivity, health, and safety standards have to be continuously evaluated and improved, putting more pressure on training deliveries. Borrowing from Defence and Airspace industries, training in the mining industry is increasingly relying on immersive virtual reality to simulate complex operations and procedures in potentially dangerous environments. Coal Services Pty Ltd {{is at the forefront}} of modern training facilities in Australia. This paper presents a qualitative and quantitative research framework designed to analyse the impact of past and current training sessions on staff’s ability to better perform their tasks, overall safety standards, and mine productivity. Interviews with trainees, trainers, and managers are used alongside session recordings to qualitatively evaluate levels of knowledge transfer and aptitudes to perform in a real environment. Then, a cost-benefit analysis is used to evaluate the added-value of virtual reality-based on technological and operational costs weighed against overall productivity of the mine being negatively affected by any safety issue.

40|$|As {{national}} health systems pursue the common goals of containing expenditure growth and improving quality, many {{have sought to}} replace autonomous modes (systems) of physician control that rely on <b>initial</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training</b> and subsequent peer review. A common approach has involved extending bureaucratic modes of physician control that employ techniques such as hierarchical coordination and salaried positions. This paper applies concepts from studies of professional work to frame an empirical analysis of emergent bureaucratic modes of physician control in US hospital-based systems. Conceptually, we draw from recent studies to update Scott's (Health Services Res. 17 (3) (1982) 213) typology to specify three bureaucratic modes of physician control: heteronomous, conjoint, and custodial. Empirically, we use case study evidence from eight US hospital-based systems to illustrate the heterogeneity of bureaucratic modes of physician control that span each of the ideal types. The findings indicate that some influential analysts perpetuate a caricature of bureaucratic organization which underplays its capacity to provide multiple modes of physician control that maintain professional autonomy over the content of work, and present opportunities for aligning practice with social goals.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{objective}} of this dissertation is to map, analyse and assess the role of modern {{information and communication technologies}} in the field of media education within the initial training and lifelong professional education provided by the police training colleges in the Czech Republic. Media literacy is a part of core competency of each individual in the current societal epoch, which is defined by the communication explosion. The issues of media education are pursued by media pedagogy. The work submitted analyses the scope of media education elements within the individual teaching subjects which are parts of police educational programmes approved by the Police Presidium of the Czech Republic. The research part of the thesis focuses on assessing the media literacy level of Czech police officers.

40|$|Providing {{treatment}} {{and help to}} family members of people with alcohol and drug problems is a new approach. In the UK, Copello et al (2000 a,b) developed a new intervention: the ‘ 5 -Step Method’, which has shown positive results in reducing family members symptoms and improving their coping. This method has been utilised in Italy, also with positive results. This paper analyses 52 treatment reports compiled by the treating professionals, to examine how well the method has been introduced into the Italian socio-cultural context. Information about the intervention from these treatment reports was grouped into categories by independent judges. These categories were analysed using univariate statistics, followed by multivariate dynamic analysis using STATIS, a multidimensional statistical methodology capable of analysing the temporal phenomenon (over the five sessions) in question. This methodology examined the resulting 3 -way matrix: cases, variables, and time. The analysis shows that the training was effective: the trained personnel did deliver the five steps and did do in each step what was suggested in the manual. It also suggests that some overall strategies, such as giving family members a plan, and proposing up to five sessions with the family member, are very helpful interventions. Suggestions for improving both the intervention, and for incorporating instruction in this method as part of <b>initial</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training,</b> are made...|$|E
40|$|The {{second wave}} of studies on {{political}} advisers defends a broad view of policy advisory systems where politicians rely on a multitude of knowledge and advice providers. Even if governance reforms enlarged the advisory system to a multitude of participants, mainly external (e. g. consultants, scientists, NGOs, or think tanks), public officials working within government remain major providers of advice to the ministers. A significant part of their policy work consists in providing policy notes and more or less processed information to the ministers and their cabinet members. This paper aims at identifying the characteristics of these bureau-ministerial advisers, that is public officials {{who are the most}} intensively involved in advice provision to ministers. It relies on a survey conducted in Belgium in both the federal and regional government on in-house policy work by graduated public officials (N= 3, 481). This survey is in many points similar with previous enquiries conducted in e. g. Canada and the Czech Republic. An index of advice giving to ministers is first built to assess the contribution of individual respondents to the request and needs of ministerial cabinets {{on the basis of the}} kind of policy tasks conducted and the contribution to policy documents. Linear multiple regression is used as the method to identify the characteristics of the bureau-ministerial advisers.

40|$|The ‘Fashion Tales’ Conference {{identifies}} three fashion discourses: that of making, that of media, {{and that}} of scholarship. We propose a fourth, which provides a foundational base for the others: the discourse of fashion pedagogy. We begin with the argument that to thrive {{in any of these}} discourses, all fashion graduates require the ability to navigate the complexities of the 21 st century fashion industry. Fashion graduates emerge into a professional world which demands a range of high level capabilities above and beyond those traditionally acknowledged by the discipline. Professional education in fashion must transform itself to accommodate these imperatives. In this paper, we document a tale of fashion learning, teaching and scholarship – the tale of a highly successful future-orientated boutique university-based undergraduate fashion course in Queensland, Australia. The Discipline consistently maintains the highest student satisfaction and lowest attrition of any course in the university, achieves extremely competitive student satisfaction scores when compared with other courses nationally and internationally, and reports outstanding graduate employment outcomes. The core of the article addresses how the course effectively balances five key pedagogical tensions identified from the findings of in-depth focus groups with graduating students, and interviews with teaching staff. The pedagogical tensions are: high concept/ authenticity; high disciplinarity/ interdisciplinarity; high rigour/ play; high autonomy/ scaffolding; and high individuality/ community, where community can be further divided into high challenge and high support. We discuss each of these tensions and how they are characterised within the course, using rich descriptions given by the students. We also draw upon the wider andragogical and learning futures literatures to link the tensions with what is already known about excellence in 21 st century higher and further education curriculum and pedagogic practice. We ask: as the fashion industry becomes truly globalised, virtualised, and diversified, and as <b>initial</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training</b> for the industry becomes increasingly massified and performatised, what are the best teaching approaches to produce autonomous, professionally capable, enterprising and responsible graduates into the future?

40|$|The Health Foundation {{is pleased}} to publish this {{contribution}} to current debate {{about how best to}} educate, train and develop the skills of health and care professionals to enable them {{to improve the quality of}} services. The past few years have seen increasing interest in improving quality as part of the professional role, which is a great step forward in itself. We are aware of the rise in formal and informal training opportunities that are now available, from modules in <b>initial</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training,</b> to Masters level degrees and short in-service courses. We want to ensure that our contribution best complements what is offered by universities, statutory training bodies and NHS organisations. While there are many courses that focus on particular approaches, competencies and skills, the unique contribution that Professor Bill Lucas brings to this arena is to suggest that we instead think about what attributes individuals need to foster if they are to be able to succeed with bringing about change and improvement in the quality of care and services. The current paper builds upon extensive work by Bill and others, in engineering and elsewhere, with the aim of ensuring that individuals are able to reflect upon, communicate and collaborate to shape further national and local activity. Continuous improvement is a key principle of the Foundation and is supported by the perspective outlined in this thought paper, namely, the importance of defining and consciously developing the habits that enable and facilitate improvement as a key professional skill. Such an understanding is crucial in the development and implementation of education and training to help individuals to become successful improvers in the complex world of health and social care. The key ideas in this paper will be taken forward with relevant partners to influence the future direction and approach to training in this important area. While recognising that individual aptitudes and habits of mind are critical, they need to be actively developed, supported and reinforced by the way in which improvement interventions are designed, planned, implemented and evaluated.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Didactics)) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2006 There are vast {{differences}} between traditional content-based education and transformational outcomes-based education. For example, in content-based education teachers {{are viewed as}} the main sources of knowledge whereas in OBE teachers are viewed as facilitators of learning. In content-based education, assessment mostly focuses on the knowledge aspect of learners, rather than on skills, attitude and values. Teachers trained for traditional teaching should somehow be assisted {{to adjust to the}} outcomes-based way of teaching. This study firstly wants to identify the didactic-professional needs related to OBE of secondary school teachers in the Venda region of the Limpopo Province. The study identifies two categories of didactic-professional needs, namely: • Needs to improve secondary school teachers' academic competence • Needs to improve secondary school teachers' professional competence. The second objective {{of this study is to}} analyse and evaluate current distance education practice based in a printed format as means to satisfy secondary school teachers' didactic-professional needs related to OBE. The third objective of this study is to investigate the effectiveness of distance education based on print to satisfy the Limpopo Province Venda region secondary school teachers' didactic-professional and academic needs related to OBE to determine criteria and guidelines to this effect. A stratified systematic sample of 331 secondary school teachers and managers, including 148 persons who are or have already been involved in distance education, was selected to participate in the study. Data were collected through the use of a questionnaire and interviews with selected persons. Quantitative analysis of data employed a factor analysis to determine significant factors to work with. Cronbach's Coefficient Alpha to establish reliability of instruments, and Cohen's Criterion of effect size to determine significance of differences were used. The main findings of the study are: • The following six factors are regarded as important to satisfy secondary school teachers' didactic-professional needs: 1. Learning strategies centring around learner activities 2. Learner-centred assessing strategies 3. Learners' performance assessing strategies 4. Outcomes and methods of achieving outcomes 5. Educator centred teaching strategies 6. Learner- centred teaching strategies. • Counselling, tutoring and preparation for study are important in distance education to satisfy secondaly school teachers' didactic-professional needs related to OBE. However, counselling and preparation for study sometimes occur in the distance education currently available in the region, particularly in distance education programmes offered through an agent for a university. The findings further show certain differences with regard to teachers' needs and their satisfaction according to the experience, the nature of <b>initial</b> <b>professional</b> <b>training,</b> and the level of the current academic qualifications of the teachers. Finally the study recommends a plan of action to provide distance education based on print to satisfy the didactic-professional needs related to OBE of the Venda region secondary school teachers in Limpopo. The main elements of the plan include: • Effective contact sessions with lecturers. • Regular tutorial sessions under guidance of facilitators (tutors). • A multi-media approach. • Access to counselling and study guidance. • Relevant and integrated summative and formative assessment. • Efficient communication between the academic institution involved and the agent that acts on their behalf (where applicable).
