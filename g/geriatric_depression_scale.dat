50|$|The <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale</b> (GDS) is a 30-item self-report {{assessment}} used {{to identify}} depression in the elderly. The scale was first developed in 1982 by J.A. Yesavage and others.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale</b> (GDS) {{is another}} self-administered scale, {{but in this}} case it is used for older {{patients}}, and for patients with mild to moderate dementia. Instead of presenting a five-category response set, the GDS questions are answered with a simple [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no". The Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale is similar to the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale</b> in that the answers are preformatted. In the Zung Self-Rating Depression Scale, there are 20 items: ten positively worded and ten negatively worded. Each question is rated on a scale of 1 through 4 based on four possible answers: [...] "a little of the time", [...] "some of the time", [...] "good part of the time", and [...] "most of the time".|$|E
5000|$|In the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale,</b> {{questions}} are answered [...] "yes" [...] or [...] "no." [...] A five-category response set is not utilized {{in order to}} ensure that that the scale is simple enough to be used when testing ill or moderately cognitively impaired individuals, for whom a more complex set of answers may be confusion, or lead to inaccurate recording of responses.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Depression {{is common}} in {{patients}} with Parkinson’s disease (PD) and has been identifi ed as the main factor negatively impacting quality of life. It {{has been reported that}} depression in PD is under-recognized and under-treated. We report on 90 patients with PD who completed the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (GDS). Thirteen subjects (14 %) scored above 15, the proposed cut-off for diagnosing depression in this illness. Detailed medical record review for these subjects revealed that depression was recognized and treated in only about one-half of the cases. Comparison of mean subscale scores between subjects scoring above and below the cut-off for diagnosis of depression revealed that each of 6 proposed subscales effectively distinguished the two groups. Review of individual items demonstrated that many of the subjects endorsed low energy, regardless of whether they were depressed. This study supports the notion that efforts should be made to educate patients, caregivers and physicians about identifying depression in PD.

Three groups of patients were recruited {{in this study}} including PD patients with dementia (PDD; n = 10), with mild cognitive impairment (PD-MCI; n = 20), and with no cognitive impairment (PD-NC; n = 30). The groups were matched for age, sex, education, disease duration, motor disability, levodopa equivalent dose and <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (GDS) score. All subjects underwent a FDG-PET study. Maps of regional metabolism in the three groups were compared using statistical parametric mapping (SPM 5). PD-MCI patients exhibited limited areas of hypometabolism in the frontal, temporal and parahippocampal gyrus compared with the PD-NC patients (p < 0. 01). PDD patients had bilateral areas of hypometabolism in the frontal and posterior parietal-occipital lobes compared with PD-MCI patients (p < 0. 01), and exhibited greater metabolic reductions in comparison with PD-NC patients (p < 0. 01). Compared with PD-NC patients, hypometabolism was much higher in the PDD patients than in PD-MCI patients, mainly in the posterior cortical areas.

40|$|Background: Screening of {{depressive}} symptoms is recommended in recurrent fallers. Compared to the 30 -item and 15 -item <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scales</b> (GDS), the 4 -item GDS is easier to administer and quicker to perform. The association between abnormal 4 -item GDS score and recurrent falls {{has not yet been}} examined. In addition, while depressive symptoms-related gait instability is well known, the association with recurrent falls has been few studied. Objective: 1) To examine the association between abnormal 4 -item GDS score and recurrent falls in community-dwelling older adults using original data from health examination centers (HEC) of French health insurance of Lyon, and 2) to perform a systematic review of studies that examined the association {{of depressive}} symptoms with recurrent falls among older adults. Methods: Firstly, based on a cross-sectional design, 2, 594 community-dwellers (mean age 72. 1 +/- 5. 4 years; 49. 8 % women) were recruited in HEC of Lyon, France. The 4 -item GDS score (abnormal if score >= 1) and recurrent falls (i. e., 2 or more falls in the past year) were used as main outcomes. Secondly, a systematic English and French Medline literature search was conducted on May 28, 2012 with no limit of date using the following Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms "Aged OR aged, 80 and over", "Accidental falls", "Depressive disorder" and "Reccurence". The search also included the reference lists of the retrieved articles. Results: A total of 19. 0 % (n= 494) participants were recurrent fillers in the cross-sectional study. Abnormal 4 -item GDS score was more prevalent among recurrent fallers compared to non-recurrent fallers (44. 7 % versus 25. 0 %, with P< 0. 001), and was significantly associated with recurrent falls (Odd ratio (OR) = 1. 82 with P< 0. 001 for full model; OR= 1. 86 with P< 0. 001 for stepwise backward model). In addition to the current study, the systematic review found only four other studies on this topic, three of them examining the association {{of depressive symptoms}} with recurrent falls using 30 -item or 15 -item GDS.

However, most studies did not include environmental factors in the statistical models, introducing a bias to estimate <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk because the urban environment {{was found to have}} significant associations with mental health. We developed a cross-sectional study with a binomial logistic regression to examine the <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk of a high-density city based on five social vulnerability factors and four environmental measures. We constructed a socio-environmental vulnerability index by including the significant variables to map the <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk in Hong Kong, a high-density city characterized by compact urban environment and high-rise buildings. Crude and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) of the variables were significantly different, indicating that both social and environmental variables should be included as confounding factors. For the comprehensive model controlled by all confounding factors, older adults who were of lower education had the highest <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risks (OR: 1. 60 (1. 21, 2. 12)). Higher percentage of residential area and greater variation in building height within the neighborhood also contributed to <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk in Hong Kong, while average building height had negative association with <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk. In addition, the socio-environmental vulnerability index showed that higher scores were associated with higher <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk at neighborhood scale. The results of mapping and cross-section model suggested that <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk was associated with a compact living environment with low socio-economic conditions in historical urban areas in Hong Kong. In conclusion, our study found a significant difference in <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk between unadjusted and adjusted models, suggesting the importance of including environmental factors in estimating <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk. We also developed a framework to map <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> risk across a city, which can be used for identifying neighborhoods with higher risk for public health surveillance and sustainable urban planning...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Mood {{disorders}} are a frequent problem in old age, and their symptoms constitute an important public health issue. These alterations affect {{the quality of}} life mainly by restricting social life. The participation in a regular exercise program is an effective way of reducing or preventing the functional decline associated with aging. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the effects of fitness-endurance activity (at the intensity of Ventilatory Threshold 1 (VT- 1)) in depression, anxiety and quality of life scores in seniors. METHODS: The study involved 46 sedentary seniors aged 60 - 75 (66. 97 ± 4. 80) who were randomly allocated to two groups: 1) Control group, which was neither asked to vary their everyday activities nor to join a regular physical fitness program; and 2) Experimental group, whose members took part in an aerobic fitness program consisting of ergometer cycle sessions 3 times a week on alternate days for six months working at a heart rate corresponding to ventilatory threshold (VT- 1) intensity. Subjects were submitted to a basal evaluation using the <b>geriatric</b> <b>depression</b> screening <b>scale</b> - GDS, STAI trait/state (anxiety scale) and SF- 36 (quality of life scale).

We aimed to investigate the age-related airways oxidative stress, using non invasive, safe and repeatable techniques; to evaluate the correspondence between systemic and local oxidative stress in healthy subjects of different age ranges; to analyse the correlation between systemic and local oxidative stress with lung function and with cognitive impairment. METHODS: Thirty consecutive healthy high school graduated subjects (8 M, 22 F), divided in three ranges of age (60 years) were enrolled. All subjects underwent oxygen free radicals and exhaled nitric oxide measurement (by the diacron reactive oxygen metabolites test and by a rapid-response chemiluminescence nitric oxide analyzer), lung function tests, and cognitive impairment scales (Mini Mental State Examination and <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale).</b> RESULTS: A significant increase of oxygen free radicals, exhaled nitric oxide, and <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale</b> score and a significant decrease of forced expiratory volume in 1 second and forced expiratory vital capacity from younger to older subjects were identified. Moreover, the significant positive correlation between oxygen free radicals and exhaled nitric oxide, and between oxygen free radicals and exhaled nitric oxide with <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> <b>Scale</b> score were found. The significant negative correlation between forced expiratory volume in 1 second and oxygen free radicals or exhaled nitric oxide was also demonstrated.

The aim {{of the study was to}} analyze the change of quality of life and level of depression, as well as possible association of quality of life and level of depression, in elderly people admitted for the first time to nursing home. Methods: The research included 38 participants (10 men and 28 women). The data were obtained using the <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> Short Form (GDS-SF) and a short form of the Quality of Life Enjoyment and Satisfaction Questionnaire (Q-LES-Q-SF). Results: The average age was 79. 2 (SD = 6. 9) with a variation span of 30 years, minimum age was 62 (n = 1) and maximum age was 92 years (n = 1). The participants experienced a clinically significant reduction in depression symptoms, moving from a mild depression zone (8 - 12 points) to the zone of clinical standard (7 points or less). An essential finding was a strong negative correlation between the quality of life and depression. Conclusions: Obtaining information on depression and the quality of life of elderly in nursing home settings should be introduced as a standard part of nursing activities in order to improve the quality of customer care in the nursing homes...|$|R
40|$|Background: Apathy {{is defined}} as an {{important}} loss of motivation in all domains of daily functioning. Especially in old age, apathy might be a specific neuropsychiatric syndrome separate from depression. There are indications that apathy in elderly subjects is related to vascular disease. Objective: To assess the relation between vascular disease and apathy in subjects aged 85 years and older. Methods: The Leiden 85 -plus Study is a prospective, population-based study of 500 elderly subjects. Vascular disease including myocardial infarction, angina pectoris or myocardial ischemia, claudicatio intermittens, and arterial surgery was determined at baseline. Symptoms of apathy were assessed annually from age 85 through 90 years using the apathy questions of the 15 -item <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (GDS). Diagnostic accuracy of the apathy questions was validated using the Apathy Scale at age 90 years. The association between vascular disease and apathy was estimated both at baseline and longitudinally. Results: The apathy items of the GDS showed a sensitivity of 69 % and a specificity of 85 %. At baseline, 69 subjects with apathy but free of depression had significantly more cardiovascular pathologies compared to 287 subjects without apathy. In the 287 subjects who were free of apathy and depression, increase of apathy but not depression during follow-up was significantly higher for each additional cardiovascular pathology at baseline. Conclusion: In community dwelling elderly, those with vascular disease were at higher risk of developing apathy but not depression. This suggests that apathy and depression in old age have different etiologies. Copyright © 2007 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Surveys of {{disclosure}} of a dementia diagnosis illustrate {{low rates of}} telling across different professional groups. The reluctance of carers to disclose the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease suggests that they may hold different and more catastrophic views of the disease than the patients themselves. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the cognitive and emotional mechanisms (illness representations) by which patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease and their carers conceptualise their understanding of the disease. A cross-sectional study design was adopted which employed both correlational and comparative analyses. Twenty people with Alzheimer's disease and twenty carers completed semi-structured interviews to gather responses to the Illness Perception Questionnaire (IPQ) and <b>Geriatric</b> <b>Depression</b> Rating <b>Scale</b> (GDS). Qualitative data was gathered regarding opinions relating to disclosure of dementia diagnosis. Comparison of patient's illness representations with those of other broadly comparable medical conditions found significance dependent on illness representation dimension and disease group. Patient's illness representations showed some significant associations between sub-scales. No associations between illness representation variables were found for carers. Carers' belief in more negative consequences was associated with high levels of depression attributed to the patient. No association between illness representation and depression variables was found for patients. Significant differences in illness representation and depression variables were found between patient and carer groups with carers attributing more severe symptomology, chronic time course and negative consequences to Alzheimer's than patients. The clinical and theoretical implications of these findings are discussed. Limitations of the present study are acknowledged and ideas for future research are presented...|$|R
