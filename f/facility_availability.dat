50|$|The Badger State Games are a set {{of annual}} Olympic-style {{competitions}} for amateur athletes {{from the state of}} Wisconsin. It {{is a member of the}} National Congress of State Games. The Badger State Games began in 1985 and hold both summer and winter games annually. In August 2011, the Wisconsin Sports Development Corporation (WSDC), the manager of the Games, decided to discontinue the summer and winter events. The WSDC stated that the Games had served its purpose and that the current market for amateur athletic events had become saturated, which had lowered participation in recent years. In October 2011, it was announced that the WSDC had reached an agreement to sell the Badger State Games brand to the Wausau/Central Wisconsin Convention and Visitors Bureau (CVB). Instead of accepting a cash payment, the WSDC asked that the CVB provide $5,000 athlete scholarships for the Winter Games for the next three years. It was agreed that the Winter Games would be held in the Wausau area, and the Summer Games would continue to be held in the Fox Cities for at least the following three years. The CVB announced that the following events would be held in the February 2012 Winter Games: Alpine Skiing, Billiards, Bowling, Curling, Figure Skating, Indoor Archery (last two weekends in January) and Nordic (Cross Country) Skiing.

Methods: A sample of 536 adolescents (51 % boys) aged 12 - 17 years were randomly assigned to intervention or control condition. Questionnaires were used to assess different PA behaviors, psychosocial determinants and PEB at baseline and at 3 -month follow-up. Mediating effects were assessed with the bootstrapping method. Results: PEB regarding neighborhood safety mediated the effect of the intervention on all PA indices. PEB regarding sports <b>facilities</b> <b>availability</b> at neighborhood and PEB regarding sport-related <b>facilities</b> <b>availability</b> at school mediated the effect of the intervention on moderate to vigorous PA (MVPA) and moderate PA (in leisure time and at school, respectively). Social support from a sports partner suppressed the effect of the intervention on vigorous PA and MVPA. No other factor had a mediation effect. Conclusions: All PEB measures appear to mediate PA behaviors of different intensities and in different contexts. Interventions promoting PA in adolescents should also focus on improving the targeted PEB as mediators of engagement in PA to bring the desired effects in actual behaviors...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The {{identification}} of various individual, social and physical environmental factors affecting physical activity (PA) behavior in Canada {{can help in}} the development of more tailored intervention strategies for promoting higher PA levels in Canada. This study examined the influences of various individual, social and physical environmental factors on PA participation by gender, age and socioeconomic status, using data from the 2002 nationwide survey of the Physical Activity Monitor. Methods In 2002, 5, 167 Canadians aged 15 – 79 years, selected by random-digit dialling from household-based telephone exchanges, completed a telephone survey. The short version of the International Physical Activity Questionnaire was used to collect information on total physical activity. The effects of socio-economical status, self-rated health, self-efficacy, intention, perceived barriers to PA, health benefits of PA, social support, and <b>facility</b> <b>availability</b> on PA level were examined by multiple logistic regression analyses. Results Self-efficacy and intention were the strongest correlates and had the greatest effect on PA. Family income, self-rated health and perceived barriers were also consistently associated with PA. The effects of the perceived health benefits, education and family income were more salient to older people, whereas the influence of education was more important to women and the influence of perceived barriers was more salient to women and younger people. <b>Facility</b> <b>availability</b> was more strongly associated with PA among people with a university degree than among people with a lower education level. However, social support was not significantly related to PA in any subgroup. Conclusion This study suggests that PA promotion strategies should be tailored to enhance people's confidence to engage in PA, motivate people to be more active, educate people on PA's health benefits and reduce barriers, as well as target different factors for men and women and for differing socio-economic and demographic groups. </p...|$|E

The Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is used to produce a set of weighted rankings for each characteristic for each alternative system. A mathematical model is derived which incorporates these weighting factors. The method imposes higher availability requirements on those systems in which an incremental increase in availability is easier to achieve, and lower availability requirements where greater availability is more difficult and costly.

40|$|The {{demand for}} low income condominiums {{in the city}} of Colombo has {{gradually}} increased {{in the past few decades}} in order to provide accommodation for low income earners and resettlement of shanty dwellers with the upsurge of land values in urban areas. Living in a condominium is considerably different from living in a sovereign house. In a condominium, personal ownership is limited to interior of the unit and requires sharing responsibilities with all the unit owners for the exterior of the complex. Identifying the issues in condominiums which have been designed for the low income community is essential to provide better living environment. Thus, it is vital to identify the satisfaction level of occupants who are settled in low income condominiums with respect to their living condition. Therefore, this study aims to fill the existing research gaps by investigating the existing living condition of condominiums which designed for low income families in terms of user satisfaction. First, a literature survey was carried out. This was followed by a comprehensive questionnaire survey as the data collection technique. Data were collected addressing the satisfaction on living condition under five main areas namely; social condition, <b>facilities</b> <b>availability,</b> management and maintenance of facilities, design and construction, and legal aspects. The results were analysed calculating the percentage values of each aspect. It was identified that 12 % of occupants were only satisfied with the social condition in condominium living.
