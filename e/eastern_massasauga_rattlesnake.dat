5|$|Three {{species of}} {{reptiles}} {{are considered to}} be threatened and two species are endangered– these are protected under the Endangered Species Act of the State of Michigan. Six more species {{are considered to be}} of special concern, though not protected under the act. The copperbelly water snake is listed as threatened by the federal government, while the <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> is a candidate species to be included on the US endangered species list.|$|E
5|$|Michigan, one of {{the fifty}} United States, is home to two types of lizards, {{nineteen}} types of snakes and eleven types of turtles, {{all members of the}} class Reptilia. Reptiles are found throughout Michigan, although the only venomous species, the <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> is seen only in the Lower Peninsula. Reptiles are cold-blooded, and so usually pass the cold winters of Michigan in frost-free areas, such as underground burrows (for snakes and land-dwelling turtles) or the bottoms of lakes and streams (for water-dwelling turtles). Most reptiles in Michigan are protected by state law, but many are still at risk due to human encroachment on their habitats, the draining of wetlands and, in the case of snakes, indiscriminate killing by fearful humans. In 1995, the painted turtle was named as Michigan's state reptile.|$|E
25|$|There are no fatally {{poisonous}} snakes {{native to}} Northern Michigan. The poisonous <b>Eastern</b> <b>Massasauga</b> <b>Rattlesnake</b> lives in Michigan, {{but it is}} not common, particularly in Northern Michigan. In any event, its non-fatal bite may make an adult sick, but it should be medically treated without delay.|$|E
50|$|Chrysosporium {{has been}} {{identified}} as an emerging infectious disease, first in Canada affecting reptiles at around 1995. It infected <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus). By 2011, it had affected northern copperheads (Agkistrodon contortrix mokasen), timber rattlesnakes, black rat snakes, black racer snakes and eastern garter snakes in New Jersey.|$|R
40|$|As reptile populations {{worldwide}} decline, {{construction and}} monitoring of road mortality mitigation measures is becoming common. I studied {{the effectiveness of}} barrier fencing at preventing <b>Eastern</b> <b>Massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnakes</b> (Sistrurus catenatus) from gaining access to the road. I also tested whether ecopassages were effective at allowing Massasaugas to access habitat {{on both sides of}} the road. I determined that there was a reduction of Massasaugas on the road post-installation of barrier fencing. Data from various monitoring approaches showed that Massasaugas do indeed use the ecopassages to cross the road. I quantified the long-term effect of mitigation structures on the population viability of Massasaugas. A Population Viability Analysis revealed that post-mitigation construction, the study population has a low probability of extinction, suggesting that mitigation is effective at promoting a sustainable population. Analyzing the effects of road mortality at the population level is crucial to ensure that decision makers are adequately informed of the status of species-at-risk...|$|R

40|$|Decisions {{affecting}} wildlife manage ment {{and conservation}} policy of imperiled species are often aided by population models. Reliable population models require accurate estimates of vital rates {{and an understanding}} of how vital rates vary geographically. The <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> (Sistrurus catenatus catenatus) is a rattlesnake species found in the Great Lakes region of North America. Populations of the <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> are fragmented and only a few areas harbor multiple, sizable populations. <b>Eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> research has typically focused on single populations or local metapopulations but results suggest that demographic parameters vary geographically. We used 21 radiotelemetry datasets comprising 499 tele-metered snakes from 16 distinct locations throughout the range of the <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> to characterize geographic patterns of adult survival using the known-fate model in Program MARK. Annual adult survival ranged from 0. 35 to 0. 95 (mean ¼ 0. 67) and increased along a southwest to northeast geographic axis. Further analysis of 6 datasets indicated no consistent difference in survival between males and females. Our results provide {{a better understanding of the}} relationship between survivorship and geography for the <b>eastern</b> <b>massasauga</b> and suggest that such variation should be incorporated into population models as well as local and regional management plans...|$|R

5|$|The {{southern}} {{section of}} Highway58 begins at a junction {{with the former}} Highway3 {{in the city of}} Port Colborne, several kilometres north of Lake Erie. South of this intersection, the road once continued as Niagara Regional Road 64 to Killaly Street; such has since been downloaded to the city of Port Colborne. Proceeding north, the highway, known locally as West Side Road, passes through the suburbs of Port Colborne, north of which it skirts {{the eastern edge of the}} Wainfleet Bog, one of the few remaining habitats of the <b>Massasauga</b> <b>Rattlesnake.</b>|$|R
50|$|Amphibians {{found in}} and near Long Lake include the tiger salamander, blue-spotted salamander, chorus frog, spring peeper, American toad, Fowler's toad, green frog and bullfrog. Reptiles include the {{snapping}} turtle, common musk turtle, painted turtle, common garter snake, racer, Eastern hognose snake, and six-lined racerunner. There {{has been an}} unconfirmed sighting of the rare <b>Eastern</b> <b>Massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake</b> near Long Lake as well, and the slender glass lizard is found nearby.|$|E
50|$|The Springville {{area was}} {{originally}} almost entirely forest, {{but is now}} a mixture of forest and farmland. The town stands on a low hill that divides the watershed of Trail Creek from the Galena River, which rises a short distance to the east. The nearby Springfield Fen provides habitat for the rare <b>Eastern</b> <b>Massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> which {{is known to be}} extant at only two other sites in Northwest Indiana.|$|E
50|$|Beausoleil Island {{is one of}} {{the last}} refuges for the seldom-seen <b>Eastern</b> <b>Massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> the only snake in Ontario whose venom is {{potentially}} dangerous to humans. On sunny days, Georgian Bay's cobalt waters form a striking counterpart to the light blue of the sky, the pinkish rocks of the Canadian Shield, and the dark green of the park's famous windswept pines. The Fairy Lake and Cambrian Trails, in the north of the island, offer especially striking views of these natural features.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to the water that feeds the bog, the glacier also left behind plants that are unique to Cedar Bog. Many of these plants are rare or endangered. The sedges and other plants that grow here {{left behind by the}} last glacier were the food for mastodons and giant sloths that once roamed the earth. Also, trees found here like bog birch and northern white cedar are more commonly found in the more northern boreal forest. Cedar Bog is also the home of the endangered spotted turtle, <b>massasauga</b> <b>rattlesnake,</b> and Milbert's tortoise-shell butterfly.|$|R
50|$|Rattlesnakes tend {{to avoid}} {{developed}} areas, preferring undisturbed, natural habitats. Rapid habitat destruction by humans, mass killings during {{events such as}} rattlesnake round-ups, and deliberate extermination campaigns all pose threats to rattlesnake populations in many areas. Several species of rattlesnakes, such as the timber <b>rattlesnake,</b> <b>massasauga,</b> and canebrake <b>rattlesnake,</b> are listed as threatened or endangered in many U.S. states.|$|R
