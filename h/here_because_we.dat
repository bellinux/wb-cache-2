2500|$|In Washington, [...] "at least tens of thousands", or [...] "several hundred thousand" [...] people {{demonstrated}} {{through the}} city, {{ending with a}} rally at The Mall. Among the speakers was Rev. Jesse Jackson who told the crowd that [...] "We are <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> choose coexistence over coannihilation." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{band members}} are Christians {{and in an}} {{interview}} with the BBC, Josh Farro stated [...] "Our faith is very important to us. It's obviously going to come out in our music because if someone believes something, then their world view is going to come out in anything they do. But we're not out here to preach to kids, we're out <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> love music." ...|$|E

3000|$|... 14 We must note <b>here</b> that <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are {{estimating}} {{a linear}} probability model {{and because the}} IV coefficient is better understood as a local average treatment effect, it is inappropriate to extrapolate this estimate {{too far away from}} the sample mean.|$|R
2500|$|... "We {{who have}} come here to Washington have come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> feel {{we have to be}} winter {{soldiers}} now. We could come back to this country; we could be quiet; we could hold our silence; we could not tell what went on in Vietnam, but we feel because of what threatens this country, the fact that the crimes threaten it, not reds, and not redcoats but the crimes which we are committing that threaten it, that we have to speak out.|$|E
2500|$|... "If the Russian fans boo {{their players}} in Moscow like {{you people are}} booing us, I'll come back and {{apologize}} personally to every one of you, but I really don't think that will happen. We gave it and are doing our best. All of us guys are really disheartened[...] [...] We came out <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> love Canada. They're a good hockey team, and we don't know {{what we could do}} better, but I promise we will figure it out. But it's totally ridiculous – I don't think it is fair that we should be booed." ...|$|E
2500|$|... {{something}} was missing. Fortunately for him, he bumped into the Reverend Billy Graham. And {{they had a}} long, long, long conversation. And he made a decision {{coming out of that}} conversation that changed his life. And he believes that if it can change his life, it can change the lives of others as well. And that is why he is so committed to this. So the reason we’re all here today is not because some politician needs to knock off one more thing on his ‘to do’ list. We are <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have a President, who is true, is a true man of God. A man who prays every day. And I think together, we can really make a difference for mankind, for Americans, we can make America a better place. We can, and I enjoyed the prayer, as we began, served, getting food. He said, if the Jews could be better Jews, and if Christians could be better Christians, if all of us could just be a little better ourselves, what a difference that would make in this world, what a difference that would make." [...] The Foundation and its members had held that this [...] "gave the appearance of endorsing religion." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "My {{last trip}} down," [...] says I, wiping off my face. [...] "If the S. & E. T. {{wants to run}} an {{excursion}} up <b>here</b> just <b>because</b> <b>we</b> kidnapped their president, let 'em. We'll put out our sign. 'The Kidnapper's Cafe and Trainmen's Home.'" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, but we aren't {{playing the}} maxims," [...] said The Maltese Cat. [...] "We're playing the game; and we've the great {{advantage}} of knowing the game. Just think a stride, Shiraz! We've pulled up from bottom to {{second place in}} two weeks against all those fellows on the ground <b>here.</b> That's <b>because</b> <b>we</b> play with our heads {{as well as our}} feet." ...|$|R
30|$|In the {{following}} theorem, we characterize the admission couple. Note that this result cannot obtained directly from Theorem 3.4 [5], <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> consider an unbounded domain.|$|R
2500|$|Bu Zhi and Wei Jing {{settled in}} Kuaiji Commandery (會稽郡), where they {{encountered}} an influential landlord, Jiao Zhengqiang (焦征羌), who allowed his retainers to behave lawlessly. As Bu Zhi and Wei Jing feared that Jiao Zhengqiang would seize {{the plot of}} land on which they farmed, they decided to offer him some of their produce as tribute. When they arrived at his residence, he was asleep {{so they had to}} wait outside. After some time, Wei Jing became impatient and wanted to leave, but Bu Zhi stopped him and said, [...] "We came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> feared he would seize our land. If we come here to visit him and then leave without even meeting him, he might think that we're insulting him and we'll only end up antagonising him." [...] After a while, Jiao Zhengqiang woke up, saw them through the window, and instructed his servants to lay mats on the ground for them to sit outside while he remained indoors. Wei Jing was enraged but Bu Zhi remained calm and composed. When it was time for lunch, Jiao Zhengqiang feasted on tasty dishes and did not invite them to join him. Instead, he had scraps of food served to them in small bowls. Wei Jing, who received only vegetables and mushrooms, was so unhappy that he did not eat at all. In contrast, Bu Zhi finished all the food he got. They then bid farewell to Jiao Zhengqiang and left. Wei Jing later scolded Bu Zhi, [...] "How can you put up with this?" [...] Bu Zhi replied, [...] "We're of lowly status. He treated us in a manner befitting our status. What's there to be ashamed of?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You know; {{get her a}} room <b>here.</b> <b>Because</b> if <b>we</b> do {{we shall}} have her {{literally}} on our hands {{as long as we}} are here. We shall have to have the whole care and responsibility of her, and I wanted you to feel just what you were going in for. You know very well I can't do things by halves, and that if I undertake to chaperon this girl I shall chaperon her--" ...|$|R
60|$|Our {{total loss}} (not {{including}} Burnside's) {{in all these}} engagements amounted to 757 killed, 4,529 wounded and 330 missing. We captured 6,142 prisoners--about 50 per cent. more than the enemy reported for their total loss--40 pieces of artillery, 69 artillery carriages and caissons and over 7,000 stands of small-arms. The enemy's loss in arms was probably much greater than <b>here</b> reported, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> picked up a great many that were found abandoned.|$|R

6000|$|... "Fine way {{you have}} of talking about us, Rover!" [...] he said, with a sour look on his face. [...] "We didn't come <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> wanted to. We came because it was necessary." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have to do}} a {{good deal}} of guess-work <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> cannot get hold of just the {{statistics}} we want. Still, we have some good statistics--and I will use those for a test.|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, we're not babies," [...] said Dot, earnestly. [...] "We're quite grown up. And we came <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> {{could not}} help it. In a few minutes we will go away again into the next Valley." ...|$|E
30|$|The {{asymptotic}} expansion of I_p was proposed {{as an exercise}} in [9], Exercise 13, p. 460, and it was attributed to Waldvogel, but the result there is less precise than Theorem  3.4 <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> have inequalities valid in {{the whole range of}} p.|$|R
5000|$|In the Eucharist, [...] "unlike {{any other}} sacrament, the mystery communion is so perfect that it {{brings us to}} the heights of every good thing: Here is the {{ultimate}} goal of every human desire, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> attain God and God joins himself to us in the most perfect union." ...|$|R
5000|$|At {{a protest}} {{as part of}} the Global March to Jerusalem held in front of the Israeli Embassy in London on March 30, 2012, Karmi stated “Israel is finished” and that “Today, <b>we</b> are <b>here</b> {{together}} <b>because</b> <b>we</b> know, we understand what Israel is doing to Jerusalem,” further stating that Jerusalem “does not belong to Jewish Israelis or to Jews. We respect all religions but we do not allow one group to take over this wonderful city.” Karmi also said that Israel does not deserve to continue as a state and that “We have no alternative but to act. The only way we can stop Israel is to act against it, against its interests, against its apartheid and policies.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{wonder who}} he is?" [...] thought Peter, staring very hard. [...] "He's bigger than either Redtail or Whitetail. I hope he isn't {{going to make}} his home <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> have trouble enough as it is." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am a kaldane," [...] replied Ghek; [...] "the highest type of created {{creature}} {{upon the}} face of Barsoom; I am mind, you are matter. I come from Bantoom. I am <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> were lost and starving." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We all have," [...] said Mrs. Hilary, tolerantly. [...] "But {{he might}} be a perfect saint--a hero--a martyr, and if he wasn't what one calls a gentleman, don't you see? We can't be frank about such things, <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> live in a republic; but--" ...|$|E
6000|$|No {{doubt the}} power of reparation, though not always perfect, is an admirable provision, ready for various emergencies, even for such as occur only at long {{intervals}} of time. (24/11. Paget ibid page 150.) Yet this power is not more wonderful than the growth and development of every single creature, more especially of those which are propagated by fissiparous generation. This subject has been <b>here</b> noticed, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> may infer that, when any part or organ is either greatly increased in size or wholly suppressed through variation and continued selection, the co-ordinating power of the organisation will continually tend to bring again all the parts into harmony with one another.] ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{dynamic binding}} {{as a basis}} for enhancing reusability. We have certain reservations, however, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> associate dynamic binding with context dependency, and context dependency goes against one of the pillars of the object-oriented paradigm: self-containment. We are in agreement, however, with Barwise and Perry [Barwise and Perry 83] when they say...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let it be {{absolutely}} forgotten. In {{such a case}} a man is bound {{to do all that}} a woman asks him, and no man has a truer spirit of chivalry than yourself. That is all. Look in when you can. I will not ask you to dine <b>here</b> as yet, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are so frightfully dull. Do your best on Tuesday, and then let us see you on Wednesday. Good-bye." ...|$|R
6000|$|Sewell {{remained}} silent, {{and they}} waited till he should speak. [...] "We {{can be of}} use to one another <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> can always be wiser for some one else than we can for ourselves. We can see another's sins and errors in a more merciful light--and that is always a fairer light--than we can our own; and we can look more sanely at others' afflictions." [...] He had addressed these words to Lapham; now {{he turned to his}} wife. [...] "If some one had come to you, Mrs. Lapham, in just this perplexity, what would you have thought?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Then came in old Mrs Hearn, whose cottage was not distant two minutes' {{walk from}} the Small House. She always called Mrs Dale [...] "my dear," [...] and petted the girls {{as though they had}} been children. When told of Lily's marriage, she had thrown up her hands with surprise, for she had still left in some corner of her drawers {{remnants}} of sugar-plums which she had bought for Lily. [...] "A London man, is he? Well, well. I wish he lived in the country. Eight hundred a year, my dear?" [...] she had said to Mrs Dale. [...] "That sounds nice down <b>here,</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> are all so poor. But I suppose eight hundred a year isn't very much up in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... [One of {{the iron}} bottles burst at that moment.] Ah! There {{is one of our}} bottles burst, and here you see is a crack down one side an eighth of an inch in width. [The other now exploded, sending the {{freezing}} mixture in all directions.] This other bottle is also broken; although the iron was nearly half-an-inch thick, the ice has burst it asunder. These changes always take place in water: they do not require to be always produced by artificial means,--we only use them <b>here</b> <b>because</b> <b>we</b> want to produce a small winter round that little bottle, instead of a long and severe one. But if you go to Canada, or to the North, you will find the temperature there out of doors will do the same thing as has been done here by the freezing mixture.|$|E
60|$|This sight was {{perfectly}} surprising, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> found the vale fruitful, level, and inhabited, there being several small villages or clusters of houses, {{such as the}} Chilians live in, which are low houses, covered {{with a kind of}} sedge, and sheltered with little rows of thick grown trees, but of what kind we knew not.|$|R
60|$|It {{all came}} like a thunderclap on Gil's friends <b>here</b> at Greendale, <b>because</b> <b>we</b> hadn't ever {{suspected}} {{things were going}} wrong. The first thing we knew was that Anne had gone up west to teach school again at St. Mary's, eighty miles away, and Gilbert, {{he went out to}} Manitoba on a harvest excursion and stayed there. It just about broke his parents' hearts. He was their only child and they just worshipped him.|$|R
30|$|Let us {{note that}} the layer-dependent {{diffusion}} versatility DV_αγ̃(A^αγ̃_βδ̃;q,T) is not equivalent to computing diffusion centrality on a network composed only by layer α, <b>because</b> <b>here</b> <b>we</b> are {{taking into account the}} whole multilayer network in its computation. Therefore diffusion versatility DV_α(A^αγ̃_βδ̃;q,T) is not equivalent to computing diffusion centrality on the single layers separately and then taking their average for each node.|$|R
