When a wave’s orbital motion reaches the seabed, it induces sediment transport. This only occurs to a water depth of about 200 m, which is the commonly adopted boundary between shallow water and deep water.The reason is that the orbital motion only extends to a water depth that is half the wavelength, and the maximum possible wavelength is generally considered to be 400 m.

40|$|Unexpected {{failure of}} subaqueous {{excavated}} slopes {{in the form}} of flow slides is considered in this graduate study. Excavated slopes {{are not the same as}} slopes constructed by means of hydraulic fill. Several recent <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failures in sand borrow pits, together with qualms in engineering practice about not knowing exactly what fundamental mechanism causes <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failure, gave cause for this study. The knowledge that <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failure may be caused by either static liquefaction of (part of) a sloping body (also called spontaneous collapse), or by the development of active banks, is taken as a point of departure. Liquefaction due to dynamic loading will be left out of consideration. Special attention will be paid to the geological circumstances of The Netherlands. Herewith, the central problem of this <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> study becomes: "How, from an engineering point of view, can we understand and predict <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failure of excavated (or being excavated) slopes, better?". To be able to answer the question at issue, we need to understand the fundamental mechanisms, leading to <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failure. Then, the soil properties may be related to the mechanisms and specific circumstances may be taken into account. The main aim of this graduate study is to obtain insight in different mechanisms, possibly triggering <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failure and causing its retrogressive nature. Since the extent of a <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> can be very large, and seems hard to predict, the prediction of the potential for failure will be the pith of the study, not the consequences of failure (Volume 1 : Literature Review). The possible ways to model failure potential are investigated and their prediction values are evaluated on the basis of case histories (Volume 3 : Case History Study / Appendix). With the insights obtained, an effort has been made to formulate a practical guideline for <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> analyses, which should lead to improvements in engineering practice (this Volume 2 : Directive for Engineering Practice).

40|$|Contrasting failure {{behaviour}} of {{two large}} landslides in clay and silt 1 Lara Fletcher, Oldrich Hungr, and S. G. Evans Abstract: Two large landslides in overconsolidated glaciolacustrine clay and silt, located in river valleys in British Columbia, {{were found to}} be quite similar in their main aspects. However, their failure behaviour was very different. One continues to exhibit intermittent, mainly ductile deformations with limited mobility which are typical of compound landslides in stiff clay. The other suddenly developed into an extremely rapid <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> of 6. 4 Mm 3, damming a large river {{in the course of a}} few minutes and projecting a wave onto the opposite bank. The <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> followed a period of strong infiltration. A comparison of the two cases explains the difference in their failure behaviour. Three possible mechanisms for brittle <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> formation are proposed, the first based on the undrained brittleness of soil at the rupture surface, the second on the high internal strength of the sliding body, and the third on macroscopic brittleness developed by pre-failure ductile deformation and softening. Both latter mechanisms are facilitated by the presence of nonplastic units in the sliding mass. Key words: overconsolidated clay, silt, landslide, <b>flow</b> <b>slide,</b> brittleness, glaciolacustrine deposits.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2003 Soil {{liquefaction}} {{has led to}} {{extensive damage}} to buildings, bridge, and lifelines in past earthquakes. While the effects of liquefaction can be manifested in many ways, the most devastating are {{in the form of}} flow slides. Flow slides can move at high speeds for distances of hundreds of meters, and destroy everything in their path. They have been observed in both natural and man-made soils, and can be triggered by many types of events of which earthquake shaking is only one. Evaluation of the potential for <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> development requires evaluation of the residual strength of liquefied soil. This problem {{has been one of the}} most difficult in geotechnical earthquake engineering because the residual strength is difficult to be measured accurately. Empirical procedures based on back-calculation of residual strength from <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> failures have been developed and used widely. These approaches suffer from (1) only a limited number of <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> case histories available, (2) some cases have little quantitative data, and (3) the process involves assumptions. These factors introduce considerable unquantified uncertainty into the predicted residual strengths. A new approach to the back-calculation of residual strength from <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> case histories has been developed. The approach objectively and consistently identify and quantify the most significant uncertainties in the parameters through the back-calculations by the Monte Carlo simulation. Each <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> case history is represented by a joint probability density function of penetration resistance and residual strength, rather than by a single deterministic data point as in previous analyses. By applying this methodology to some well-documented case histories, and applying its basic principles to other case histories, a database of residual strength data was developed. Using basic principles of soil mechanics, the approach that residual strength is related to penetration resistance was found to be consistent with field data. A predictive model for residual strength was developed. It allows estimation of the conditional probability distribution of residual strength given corrected standard penetration test resistance. It allows engineers to determine the probability of a given residual strength value being exceeded for a given average standard penetration resistance...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{behaviour}} of the tide-dominated Western Scheldt is {{in general}} well known. Its multichannel-system consists of ebb and flood channels, separated by intertidal areas; the tidal flats. The estuary shows a dynamic behaviour of erosion and sedimentation of the tidal flats. A large <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> {{occurred at the}} tidal flat of Walsoorden in July 2014. A <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> occurs when the slope is sufficient steep and a trigger starts the process of liquefaction or breaching. In {{a few hours a}} huge amount of sediment slides away, causing loss of surface and endangering safety. During this <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> approximately 800, 000 m 3 of sediment flowed to the navigation channel, leaving a large gap in the tidal flat. This <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> {{is one of the largest}} known in this part of the Western Scheldt. A measurement campaign was initiated to measure the bathymetry around the tidal flat, starting a few months before the <b>flow</b> <b>slide.</b> After the event monthly measurements were taken to monitor the development of the area. Dunes were formed on top of the accumulation of sediment, which travelled in flood (eastern) direction. A large part of the sediment accumulation was transported as bed load in flood direction, which is unexpected since the Zuidergat channel is known as an ebb channel. The sediment volume in the channel is decreasing, suggesting suspended load transport. The channel dominance is determined based on three characteristics: the water level, velocities and sediment transport. Based on water level data flood dominant behaviour is expected, while velocity and sediment transport data result in ebb dominance. Based on the bathymetry measurements, the volume changes in the channel and in the gap were determined. Those showed an exponential change in time. The erosion rate in the channel was faster than the sedimentation rate in the gap. The recovery time of the system is estimated through extrapolation of this data. The recovery time for the channel is thus shorter than the recovery time for the gap, 9 months and 1. 5 to 2 years respectively. An existing Delft 3 D model schematisation of the Western Scheldt was used to calculate the morphological development. The model was setup around the tidal flat of Walsoorden. The boundary conditions were generated by a model schematization which describes the full Scheldt estuary; the validation was performed with observations of water level and velocity along the tidal flat. The morphological changes determined by the model are different from the bathymetric changes found in the measurements. In the model the sediment accretion smoothens out; the sediment is deposited on the sides of the accumulation. Most of the sediment from the channel is transported in ebb direction. The model shows almost no sedimentation in the gap, which is contradictive with the measurements. The sensitivity of the model was tested to investigate the differences between the observations and the model. A varying sediment diameter in the model had effect on the amount of transported sediment only, not on the residual direction. The used model is a 2 DH model, neglecting the secondary circulations. The sensitivity of these processes was tested using a 3 D model. From this model it was found that the secondary circulations were not of significant importance concerning the areal development after the <b>flow</b> <b>slide.</b> Finally, a non-cohesive sediment fraction was implemented in the model. This showed sedimentation in the gap. Therefore, it is suggested that the sediment settling in the gap is a combination of cohesive and non-cohesive sediment, which is supported by the observations.

40|$|Finite {{difference}} {{analyses were}} conducted to explore the possible behaviour of soil nails in loose fill slopes which were formed by strain-softening materials. Numerical models simulating a 20 m high 35 degrees loose fill slope were set up. With the use of an undrained strain-softening soil model, the behaviour of a loose fill slope reinforced with soil nails subjected to rainfall infiltration was studied. Results indicated that soil nails together with a proper facing structure may reduce the deformation of a loose fill slope caused by rainfall infiltration and hence maintain the stability of the slope. Tensile forces in the soil nails were mobilised through the effective connections between the facing structure and the nail heads when a potential slide was being initiated. Through this mechanism, the development of a <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> at shallow depths could be avoided by the pull out resistance between the soil and the nails at deeper locations of the slope. Results also showed that, if the soil nails were not connected to a facing structure or nail heads at the slope surface, a global failure mechanism involving the development of a <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> could be observed, which was similar to that of a loose fill slope without soil nails.

This paper addresses the first results obtained with the liquefaction tank. We used a fluidization system to create a uniform, loosely packed sand bed. The liquefaction tank was subsequently tilted uniformly, while measuring the pore pressures {{at the base of}} the sand bed. Furthermore, the stability of the slope was monitored using a camera system pointed at the transparent side of the tank. We conducted around 30 tilting tests on a level sand bed while varying consolidation time, density and tilting rate. We were able to reproduce liquefaction <b>flow</b> <b>slides</b> below a particular threshold density. The moment of failure was noted by an instant, uniform liquefaction of the sand bed, preceded by an abrupt increase of excess pore pressures. The results in terms of failure angle and measured pore pressures were consistent and reproducible. The measured failure angle was much lower than anticipated from results of element tests in literature. Future research aims at relating the results to the response during undrained triaxial tests and the effect of mitigating measures. <br/...|$|R

40|$|Landslides are {{widespread}} along coasts worldwide. Understanding initiation, type, {{and areas}} affected by such landslides, is thus {{one of the}} primary concerns for coastal communities and infrastructure projects, like harbor constructions and residential settlements. Important short-term, high-energy impacts that may trigger a landslide are earthquakes and heavy rainfall events. Weak zones within the depositional succession comprising the slope are another important factor contributing not only to landslide initiation, but also to post-failure landsliding. Assessing the landslide hazard in coastal regions therefore requires a good understanding of the complex interrelations between the various high-energy external impacts and the internal mechanical characteristics of the slope material. Some of the most damaging landslides in the past occurred in soil with high sensitivity, a measure of the post-failure strength loss in the failure zone during landsliding. Such soil exhibits very low shear strength after failure, predisposing highly mobile landslides with long runout distance and dimensions difficult to predict. High sensitivities have been described for post-glacial sediments in Norway, as well as for altered tephra in New Zealand. In both regions, it is of common interest to better understand the weakening and mobilization processes in sensitive slope forming soil subjected to cyclic loading such as earthquake shaking. Furthermore, the processes that lead to high sensitivities in altered tephra are still poorly understood. This doctoral thesis aims to broaden the understanding of failure mechanisms and mobilization processes in landslides at the interface between land and water. Two landslides were investigated, that occurred in sensitive soil and affected society, economy, and natural environment in coastal regions: (1) The coastal submarine Orkdalsfjord landslide in postglacial silt, Norway, and (2) the coastal subaerial Omokoroa <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> in altered tephra, New Zealand. The vulnerability of the Orkdalsfjord landslide to cyclic loading was studied by using in situ vibratory cone penetration tests and laboratory cyclic triaxial testing. Very coarse silt layers, interbedded in the post-glacial silt unit overlying the failure surface, is more vulnerable to cyclic loading compared to surrounding finer silts. Accordingly, the very coarse silt layers {{may have contributed to the}} weakening and mobilization of the Orkdalsfjord landslide in case cyclic loading occurred during landsliding. The cyclic loading behavior of altered tephra from the Omokoroa <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> was analyzed by monotonic and cyclic triaxial testing. The altered tephra experiences brittle failure and has higher friction coefficients than normally consolidated clay, being similar to granular soil. Comparing the cyclic shear strength of altered tephra with that of marine clays shows that for altered tephra the number of loading cycles to shear failure depends more strongly on the level of shear stress applied and that altered tephra is more resistant to small cyclic loading but fails within a narrower range of shear stresses. The development of high sensitivities in altered tephra was analyzed by scanning electron microscopy and laboratory vane shear measurements along a drill core comprising the intact tephra succession of the Omokoroa <b>flow</b> <b>slide.</b> The secondary clay mineral halloysite dominates the Pahoia Tephra, a sequence that was involved in the Omokoroa <b>flow</b> <b>slide.</b> The halloysite particle morphologies are highly variable with depth. While tubular morphologies are prevalent in the upper tephra successions, the lower Pahoia Tephra sequence is dominated by spheroidal halloysite. This change in halloysite morphology coincides with an increase in sensitivity with depth. Therefore, spheroidal halloysite is likely the key in the development of sensitivity in altered tephra from New Zealand and potentially elsewhere in regions of similar volcanic origin. In the failure surface of the Omokoroa <b>flow</b> <b>slide,</b> a new open-sided spheroidal halloysite particle shape in the form of a mushroom capsa is recognized for the first time that governs the development of high mobility in the failure surface during landsliding. Based on a new a attraction-detachmenta model, it is suggested that the rearrangement in the halloysite texture during the failure process reduces the attractions between the particles at nanoscale dimensions and thus predisposes flow sliding...|$|E

The realisation of a disposal area with a volume of approximately 10 million m 3 in a restricted circumference required the excavation up to 38 m depth and construction of a ring dike, while designing the required slope with sufficient reliability. Based on international literature, in-house experience and laboratory and field tests a simplified static liquefaction model based on the critical state framework has been developed. For the reliability assessment a robust method has been adopted using stochastic analysis of the dominant parameters, while using a regional database. Several planned and unplanned failures during the realisation of the dredging activities were successfully analysed using the simplified stochastic approach of the modified state parameter model.

The channel is discontinuous, disappearing where gradients are less than about 1 : 350. Ground-truthing of the large CML shows that the entire CML is characterised by widespread deposits of generally fine sand, with coarser sand {{at the base of}} turbidites.

40|$|This paper {{illustrates}} {{an application}} {{of the theory of}} material stability to the analysis of unsaturated slopes. The main goal is to contribute to the understanding of rainfall-induced flow slides. For this purpose, a coupled hydromechanical constitutive model is combined with a simplified approach for the analysis of infinite slopes. Simple shear-test simulations are used to evaluate triggering perturbations and investigate the role of both initial suction and stress anisotropy in the activation of slope failures. The numerical simulations clearly show that different mechanisms of activation can be originated. The onset of instability is detected by introducing appropriate stability indices for distinct modes of failure: localised shear failure, static liquefaction and wetting-induced collapse. Critical intervals of slope inclinations are identified, cautioning that the predicted failure mode may change dramatically depending on initial conditions, slope angle and material properties. The numerical simulations demonstrate that, in particular circumstances, saturation of the pore space can be the unexpected result of a volumetric instability. According to this interpretation, a rainfall-induced <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> can originate from a complex chain process consisting of a sudden volume collapse, uncontrolled saturation of the pores and, eventually, catastrophic liquefaction of the deposit...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology to evaluate <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> susceptibility in potentially liquefiable sandy slopes. The proposed approach accounts for both contractive and dilative volumetric behaviour during shearing using the MIT-S 1 constitutive model. As a result, {{it is possible}} to distinguish among different types of undrained response induced by a rapid shear perturbation. The first part of the paper describes the general methodology for infinite slopes, providing an index of stability for incipient static liquefaction in shallow deposits. The methodology accounts for the anisotropy due to the initial stress state and uses simple shear simulations to assess instability conditions as a function of slope angle, stress state, and density of the soil. The resulting stability charts define the margin of safety against static liquefaction and the depths likely to be affected by the propagation of an instability. The second part of the paper applies the methodology to the well-known series of flow failures in a berm at the Nerlerk site. The MIT-S 1 model is calibrated using published data on Nerlerk sands and in situ cone penetration test (CPT) data. The analyses show that in situ slope angles α = 10 °– 13 ° are less than the critical slope angle needed for incipient instability. Liquefaction and flow failures were therefore promoted by small perturbations in shear stresses that could be generated by rapid deposition of hydraulic fill...|$|E
40|$|The {{prescriptive}} re-compaction {{method has}} been used as a common technique for upgrading loose fill slopes in Hong Kong. Due to the heavy plants required for the re-compaction work, the method may be extremely difficult and dangerous to be applied in many congested areas. To explore the possibility of using soil nails to tackle with the potential problem of liquefaction of loose fill slopes, experimental and numerical investigations have been carried out. The experimental work aims at studying the liquefaction behaviour of loosely compacted decomposed granites, which have been commonly used as a filling material. Undrained triaxial tests have been conducted on two decomposed granites with similar fines content. The use of fines content as a quantifier of the liquefaction potential, which is defined as the percentage drop of deviator stress during undrained strain softening, has been examined. The influence of moisture content at preparation on the liquefaction potential of decomposed granites has also been studied. In the numerical analyses, a 20 m high 35 ° loose fill slope was set up using a finite difference code. By employing a "pseudo" static liquefaction soil constitutive model, the behaviour of loose fill slopes with and without soil nails subjected to the effect of surface infiltration has been investigated under different assumed conditions. Reverse behaviour reported in silty sand is observed in decomposed granites which is characterised by an increase of liquefaction resistance as the confining pressure is increased. Moreover, liquefaction potential of a soil specimen is dependent on the moisture content at preparation. When a specimen is prepared at moisture contents drier than the optimum, a lower liquefaction potential would result as compared to specimens prepared at optimum moisture content. Fines content alone is found not to be a good measure for quantifying the liquefaction potential of soils. An empirical method to estimate the liquefaction potential is proposed. The method is based on the observation of the existence of an instability line in the p'-q-e space and it is evaluated by the experimental results. Based on the numerical analyses, soil nails may enhance the stability of loose fill slopes if a proper structural facing is provided. The whole structural system acts like an earth retaining structure anchored with soil nails. When the potential sliding mass is initiated due to static liquefaction, the facing at the slope surface limits the movement of the <b>flow</b> <b>slide.</b> As the failing mass pushes the facing away from the slope, axial force and bending moment in the facing are induced. At the same time, tensile forces in the soil nails are also mobilised by the outward movement of the facing. Through this mechanism, the development of a <b>flow</b> <b>slide</b> at shallow depth can be avoided by transferring the loading generated from the potential sliding mass to the pull out resistance of the soil nails at deeper locations of the slope...|$|E
