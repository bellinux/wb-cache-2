40|$|Statement (OEIS). This website is {{intended}} to provide the public and other interested entities {{with an understanding of}} the Navy’s proposal, the environmental resources to be reviewed in the NWTT EIS/OEIS, the importance of accommodating required training levels and maintaining of military readiness, and how the public can be involved in the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) process. In addition, this website contains information on how the Navy is employing protective measures to reduce environmental effects from military training and testing activities. What's New and Upcoming NWTT Supplement EIS/OEIS Notice of Intent The Navy announces its intent to prepare a Supplement to the NWTT Draft EIS/OEIS, which was released for public review and comment from Jan. 24, 2014, through April 15, 2014. The Navy’s notice of intent to prepare the Supplement to the NWTT Draft EIS/OEIS was published in the Federal Register on Friday, Oct. 24. This Supplement to the Draft EIS/OEIS will focus on substantial changes to the Proposed Action due to updated training requirements and significant new information relevant to environmental concerns per 40 Code of Federal Regulations § 1502. 9. These changes include an updated requirement for increased use of sonobuoys during training in the NWTT Study Area. The Supplement will also include additional analysis related to assessing impacts of ongoing maritime security operations, such as air emissions from <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>vessel</b> movements. Activities to be evaluated will now include maritime security escorts for Navy vessels, such as Fleet Ballistic Missile Submarines. The Supplement to the Draft EIS/OEIS is expected to be available in early December 2014. At that time, a notice of availability will be published and the public will have an opportunity to review and comment on the Supplement during a 45 -day review period. All public comments previously received on this project are still valid and are being considered in the Final EIS/OEIS...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{much effort}} {{has been devoted to}} the {{development}} of strategies to monitor and mitigate the risk of collision on inland waterways. In particular, collision avoidance of <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>vessels</b> with bridges has been widely recognized {{as a threat to the}} efficiency on river transportation systems. A comprehensive feasibility study has identified GNSS-based developments as the most promising board-side techniques for a reliable height determination as basis for bridge collision warning system. This article investigates the performance evaluation of selected GNSS-based techniques for the accurate height determination with <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> traffic purposes. The performance of different techniques is discussed in relation to the availability of data provided by land-side augmentation systems and under consideration of the available infrastructure. Technical challenges are also investigated...|$|R
40|$|The {{increasing}} tra�c in vehicular river corridors {{as well as}} {{the growing}} demands on e�ciency and positional accuracy for <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> transportation of goods have made the determination of position, navigation and timing (PNT) data including additional integrity information {{and the development of a}} driver assistance system for <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>vessels</b> based on this PNT data one of the most important challenges facing modern <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> transportation and a major practical problem for both navigators and geodesists. As the basis of a driver assistance system, this work describes the architecture of a system including the tightly-coupled sensor fusion of GNSS and IMU data for the determination of reliable PNT data in real-time with <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> tra�c purposes. Moreover, a simple mathematical model of vessel manoeuvring is presented. Optimisation approaches based on Interior Point Optimisation and Sequential Quadratic Programming are applied to search for the vessel trajectory considering several tra�c conditions. Finally, �first numerical results are presented and discussed...|$|R
40|$|Routing and {{manoeuver}} planning {{are accepted}} tasks of deep sea vessel navigation {{to increase the}} safety on sea and to improve the time- and resource efficient transport of goods and passengers. Trajectory optimization of <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>vessels</b> is a similar navigational task intended to ensure a safe passing of bridges and an efficient locking of vessels. A resilient provision of position, navigation, and timing (PNT) characterising vessels’ position and movement in real time is an essential basis for a reliable description of traffic situation. At last the quality and completeness of traffic situation parameter and the applied mathematical optimisation procedure determine the effectiveness and reliability of trajectory optimization. The paper presents the general architecture of a driver assistance system and discusses an optimisation approach based on first numerical results...|$|R
40|$|Whipping/springing {{research}} {{started in}} the 50 ’ies. In the 60 ’ies <b>inland</b> <b>water</b> <b>vessels</b> design rules became stricter due to whipping/springing. The research during the 70 - 90 ’ies may be regarded as academic. In 2000 a large ore carrier was strengthened due to severe cracking from North Atlantic operation, and whipping/springing contributed to half of the fatigue damage. Measurement campaigns on blunt and slender vessels were initiated. A few blunt ships were designed to account for whipping/springing. Based on the measurements, the focus shifted from fatigue to extreme loading. In 2005 model tests of a 4, 400 TEU container vessel included extreme whipping scenarios. In 2007 the 4400 TEU vessel MSC Napoli broke in two under similar conditions. In 2009 model tests of an 8, 600 TEU container vessel container vessel included extreme whipping scenarios. In 2013 the 8, 100 TEU vessel MOL COMFORT broke in two under similar conditions. Several classification societies have published voluntary guidelines, which {{have been used to}} include whipping/springing in the design of several container vessels. This paper covers results from model tests and full scale measurements used as background for the DNV Legacy guideline. Uncertainties are discussed and recommendations are given in order to obtain useful data. Whipping/springing is no longer academic...|$|R

40|$|Oil Spill Intelligence Report (OSIR) and Emergency Response Notification System (ERNS) data {{indicate}} that similarities and differences exist in the characteristics of inland and coastal oil spills. This paper examines data on reported oil spills {{over the last few}} years, comparing inland and coastal spill characteristics such as the number of spills, spill sizes, spill sources, and the types of oil spilled. Previous studies indicated that vessels are a major source of inland oil spills and that refined petroleum products dominate inland spills whereas crude oil spills are common in coastal areas. However, our examination of data on large spills in recent years indicates that pipelines are a much more significant spill source in <b>inland</b> <b>waters</b> than <b>vessels.</b> Recent reports also indicate that large spills of crude oil often occur in inland areas. Finally, although coastal spills tend to be highly publicized, the majority of large oil spills in the United States are to inland areas. Spills to inland areas often affect sensitive environments and can have greater impacts to public health and welfare than spills to coastal areas. Studying characteristics and patterns of larger inland and coastal spills may help in developing oil spill prevention policies and response planning...|$|R
