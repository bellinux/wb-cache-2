500|$|On September 28, in a MSNBC Town Hall, Johnson {{was asked}} by Chris Matthews to name a world leader he respected, he tried to name Vicente Fox, a former President of Mexico, but could not {{remember}} his name. The following day, he tweeted, [...] "It's been almost 24 hours...and I still can't {{come up with a}} foreign leader I look up to." [...] Later in a CNN interview, he expanded upon his reluctance to endorse political leaders, [...] "I held {{a lot of people in}} this country on pedestals and then I get to meet them up front and personal and I find out that they're all about getting re-elected, that they're not about issues, a lot of empty suits that <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> on pedestals." ...|$|E
60|$|I didn't {{hesitate}} a moment. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my bean, and we clicked beans all around.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my hand, not {{wishing to}} hear details. Mavovo rose, and with a little smile, went about his business.|$|E
6000|$|... "Grey flint, then, {{if you put}} it that way. Why the dickens must I go {{building}} {{towers of}} Babylon just because <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>up</b> one of your trains-once?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now I {{think about}} it, when <b>I</b> <b>held</b> you <b>up</b> <b>I</b> felt {{something}} give. I guess the buckle was pulling out. Well, {{we ought to}} see the brown leather." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, yes;--just fifty-six,--and so strong! Was she not? At least {{everybody}} thought so. And {{yet she was}} gone in a minute;--gone in a minute. <b>I</b> haven't <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my head since, Mr. Dean." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "All the same, at the beginning, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the job. When Brown {{could not}} work, your {{expenses}} ran on and I feel I ought to pay." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'They are {{thinking}} of the coroner's inquest, and wondering how the judge will sum up. She met my eyes, and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my hands. If I hadn't I wouldn't have been here.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{a warning}} {{hand to the}} others. [...] "You went off into a quiet little trance, that's all. I was mistaken. Either you are a psychic or {{you should have been}} an actress." ...|$|E
6000|$|But {{one might}} take a horse to water----! <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> before her, but I couldn't make her look at it. [...] "How {{do you know what}} I mayn't, or may, have liked?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Prissy Strong!" [...] <b>I</b> just <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my hands. Then I laughed. [...] "He needn't try for Prissy," [...] I said. [...] "Emmeline nipped {{that in the}} bud {{twenty years}} ago, and she'll do it again." ...|$|R
60|$|Here I put out my {{hand and}} felt in the dust, and {{presently}} my fingers touched something. It was a human tooth, very yellow, but sound. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> {{and showed it to}} Ayesha, who laughed.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a lumpy {{wrist to}} show. She took one glance at it, halted abruptly, and, neatly {{balancing}} {{herself to the}} roll, took my wrist in both her hands and gave it close scrutiny.|$|E
60|$|At {{the door}} <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my candle {{and by the}} light of it looked my last upon the ashen face of Blanche, which face I knew must go with me through all my life's days.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I {{hold that}} {{the speech of}} the tongue be as frank and as bold as [...] the look, [...] And <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> herself to herself,--that was more than she got from [...] her book." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Now," [...] I said, {{throwing}} a blanket over my shoulders, {{for the air}} was chilly, [...] "now let us talk," [...] and taking the lantern which Hans had thoughtfully lighted, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> and contemplated them.|$|R
6000|$|... "It was," [...] {{he said in}} a matter-of-fact tone, [...] "a golden, {{transparent}} liquid. Very golden, like a warm-tinted Chablis. When {{water was}} added it became streaked and opalescent, with a kind of living quiver in it. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> it <b>up</b> to the light." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As for myself, Inkoosi," [...] added Saduko, [...] "I {{only did}} my duty. How could <b>I</b> have <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my head again if the bull had killed you while I walked away alive? Why, the very girls would have mocked at me. But, oh, {{his skin was}} tough. I thought that assegai would never get through it." ...|$|R
60|$|I was {{reckless}} now, {{and went}} on, step by step, until I {{was up to}} the waist, then to the arm-pits, and then I spread out one arm and swam off while with the other <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the rod.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my {{left hand}} and arm before me, a grubby hand, a frayed cuff; but with a quality of painted unreality, transfigured as a beggar might have been by Botticelli. I looked for a time steadfastly at a {{beautiful}} pearl sleeve-link.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> {{my hand in}} the {{darkness}} before I turned to sleep that night, and I swore that no power of man or devil should ever weaken my love for the woman whose pure heart I had {{had the good fortune}} to win.|$|E
5000|$|Sin Saimdang (申師任堂, October 29, 1504 - May 17, 1551) was a Korean artist, writer, calligraphist, and poet. She was {{the mother}} of the Korean Confucian scholar Yi <b>I.</b> Often <b>held</b> <b>up</b> as a model of Confucian ideals, her respectful {{nickname}} was Eojin Eomeoni (어진 어머니; [...] "Wise Mother"). Her real name was unknown. Her pennames were Saim, Saimdang, Inimdang, and Imsajae.|$|R
6000|$|While <b>I</b> <b>held</b> him <b>up</b> from drowning, {{my partner}} [...] "brushed in" [...] around {{him so that}} he could not become submerged. We tried {{hitching}} the other horses to him in order to drag him out, but as they were saddle-horses, and had never set shoulder to a collar in their lives, they refused to pull even enough to take the proverbial setting hen off the nest.|$|R
60|$|No doubt these farmers, much beset with tramps, had {{reasonable}} {{excuse for}} their inhospitable ways, but to {{us it was}} all bitter and uncalled for. I knew that cities were filled with robbers, brigands, burglars and pirates, but <b>I</b> had <b>held</b> (<b>up</b> to this time), {{the belief that the}} country, though rude and barren of luxury was nevertheless a place of plenty where no man need suffer hunger.|$|R
60|$|An {{elephant}} in the jungle could not have caused more crashing and breaking of brush than did Emett {{as he made his}} way to me. He arrived from the forest just as Jim galloped across the flat. Mutely <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the two long ears.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> his biscuit in my hand, {{laughing}} and nodding. The whistle knelled, our narrow box drew slowly {{out of the}} station. As if heartbroken, he took his last look at me, petulantly flinging aside his mother's hand. He had lost me for ever, and Pollie and I were alone again.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you do as}} I ask you," [...] I continued, [...] "you {{shall be}} well rewarded. Look here; look at these boots," [...] and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the shooting-shoes new from Burlington Arcade. [...] "They cost thirty shillings--thirty shillings! and I will give them to you for the loan of this pair of slippers." ...|$|E
60|$|Still, Eunice never moved. I {{spoke to}} her, and {{produced}} no impression. Beginning to feel alarmed, I tried {{the effect of}} touching her. With a wild cry, she started {{into a state of}} animation. Almost at the same moment, she weakly swayed to and fro as if the pleasant breeze in the garden moved her at its will, like the flowers. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> her <b>up,</b> and led her to the seat.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{sat there}} smoking, and I sat there thinking. Twice 'e spoke to me, and <b>I</b> <b>held</b> my 'and <b>up</b> and said 'H'sh.' Then I turned to 'im {{all of a}} sudden and pinched his arm so hard he nearly dropped 'is beer.|$|R
60|$|I {{hurried to}} the top of the mound, where poor Eve sat by the couch of brush we had spread, holding her mother's hand and gazing into her face with painful anxiety. She looked up hastily as <b>I</b> approached, and <b>held</b> <b>up</b> a finger.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That is right, Ben,' he said cheerily, as <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my head; 'you will do now. I had a sharp tussle {{to get you}} here, but it is all right. We {{are setting}} inshore fast. Pull {{yourself}} together, for we shall have a rough time {{of it in the}} surf. Anyhow, we will stick together, come what may.' ...|$|E
60|$|I went again, {{bearing the}} mat {{containing}} the dead child {{in my right}} hand. But the bundle of medicines that held the living one I fastened across my shoulders. I passed out of the Emposeni, and, as I went, <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> the bundle in my right hand to the guards, showing them that which was in it, but saying nothing.|$|E
6000|$|As <b>I</b> <b>held</b> <b>up</b> my gun {{and gazed}} at the abruptly-deserted main-deck I was aware of Wada's touch on my arm. I looked. In his hand were a dozen little [...] .22 long, soft-nosed, {{smokeless}} cartridges. He wanted me to reload. I threw on the safety, opened the magazine, and tilted the rifle {{so that he could}} let the fresh cartridges of themselves slide into place.|$|E
60|$|His dragoons {{closed in}} upon me, and I--I was driven mad, as I {{thought that the}} game had been in my hands, and that I ought at that moment to be a free man. <b>I</b> <b>held</b> the cards <b>up</b> {{in front of the}} General.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{perhaps it}} is, {{but not too}} late. And now I have a good deal to say to you. First of all, you are quite right, and it was <b>I</b> who <b>held</b> you <b>up</b> last night on the Mayfield road." ...|$|R
6000|$|Indeed, {{upon all}} these occasions, such alacrity and cheerfulness was I obliged to display, that <b>I</b> was {{frequently}} <b>held</b> <b>up</b> as an illustrious example of activity, which {{the rest were}} called upon to emulate. [...] "Pull--pull! you lazy lubbers! Look at White-Jacket, there; pull like him!" ...|$|R
