2500|$|... "(O'Hare) {{was a great}} swimmer and spear fisherman, and {{he insisted}} that the {{squadron}} swim with him. Swimming with Butch O'Hare meant that at eight o'clock in the morning, you swam out into the ocean off Maui; he would still be out there {{at three in the}} afternoon! If he got hungry, Butch would roll over and dive, {{and the next thing you}} knew, he would come up with a fish of some sort. Then he'd just roll over and lie on his back like an otter and eat the thing raw! He really impressed us with that! One day, he came back to the surface with an octopus draped over his arm. He said, 'Now, you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to kill these things, boys: you bite 'em right behind the eye.' And with that, he chomped down! The octopus has some sort of spinal cord there, and biting it there does kill it! Then we had to go back to the beach where Butch would put these things in a frying pan with a little oil and some salt and stir them around. He enjoyed them, but they tasted like old rubber tires to me!" ...|$|E
2500|$|Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon list several {{disadvantages}} {{of the union}} organizing model, with the most critical being that the model is very [...] "resource-intensive," [...] {{in terms of both}} people and money. Since the organizing model is, at its core, about people, rather than services, it cannot be effective without people to both implement it and carry it out. Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon talk about [...] "...instances of a lack of support or even opposition to organizing within unions." [...] Because the organizing model is so dependent upon worker motivation and action, if the workers themselves oppose the implementation of the organizing model, it cannot be effective. Fletcher and Hurd suggest that even if members are not resistant to adoption of the organizing model, they still <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to perform tasks previously handled by organizers, and there have to be enough active members to facilitate this kind of action. This clear dependence on the support and actions of the workers is a disadvantage of the organizing model, as opposed to the servicing model, which, for the most part, does not require worker support or demand worker action. According to Heery, Simms, Simpson, Delbridge, and Salmon, [...] "Employers are often resistant." [...] Unions that have to deal with this problem would very clearly have a hard time using the organizing model, as it could antagonize the employer even further and erode any previously existing relationship between the employer and the union.|$|E
2500|$|Umibōzu {{is another}} [...] "sweeper" [...] working the rounds in Tokyo. Umibozu is a Special Forces enemy of Ryo's from the Central America conflict. Despite being on {{opposing}} forces, the two develop a friendship and mutual respect. Between his jobs, Umibozu works as waiter at the Cat's Eye cafe, owned by Miki, his former fellow soldier and lover. He {{goes by the}} professional name Falcon and his real name is Hayato Ijuin (伊集院隼人); the type haya in his name can also be read hayabusa (falcon in japanese), hence his professional name; the nickname Umibōzu was given by Ryo. His favorite weapons are the S M29 [...]44 Magnum six-inch revolver, the Saco-Defense M60 machine-gun (sometimes he uses the M249) and the M1A6 bazooka. Despite his fearsome appearance he has a phobia of kittens, he's very shy with women and much more unselfish than Ryo. his sight is very low because a fight he had with Ryo in Central America, when Ryo was a guerrilla fighter and Umibozu was a mercenary; since then, Umibozu wants a duel with Ryo to close that story; during the series, his sight will end forever and he'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to use the other four senses to move and fight; however, he decides to not retire before finishing their matter. Later Shin Kaibara, Ryo's adoptive father and former guerrilla fighter who became a drug lord, comes in Japan; his drug was tested on Ryo during his youth, causing him to attack Umibozu and his unit; when Umibozu learns this from Bloody Mary, a Ryo's old acquaintance and daughter of the other Ryo's fatherly figure in the jungle, he joins Ryo and Kaori against Kaibara. During the last story arc he marries Miki, but she's shot by enemy soldiers deployed by a new enemy of Ryo; Umibozu enters the firefight trusting Miki won't die.|$|E

60|$|The Heartbreak people {{neither could}} nor would do {{anything}} of the sort. With their heads as full of the Anticipations of Mr H. G.

Not that they would have been allowed to meddle anyhow, as only through the accident of being a hereditary peer can anyone in these days of Votes for Everybody get into parliament if handicapped by a serious modern cultural equipment; but if they had, their habit of living in a vacuum would have left them helpless end ineffective in public affairs. Even in private life they were often helpless wasters of their inheritance, like the people in Tchekov's Cherry Orchard.

60|$|Government may be {{regarded}} as consisting of two parts: the one, {{the decisions of the}} community or its recognized organs; the other, the enforcing of those decisions upon all who resist them. The first part is not objected to by Anarchists. The second part, in an ordinary civilized State, may remain entirely in the background: those who have resisted a new law while it was being debated will, as a rule, submit to it when it is passed, because resistance is generally useless in a settled and orderly community. But the possibility of governmental force remains, and indeed is the very reason for the submission which makes force unnecessary. If, as Anarchists desire, there were no use of force by government, the majority could still band themselves together and use force against the minority. The only difference would be that their army or their police force would be ad hoc, instead of being permanent and professional. The result of this would be that everyone would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>learn</b> <b>how</b> to fight, for fear a well- drilled minority should seize power and establish an old-fashioned oligarchic State. Thus the aim of the Anarchists seems hardly likely to be achieved by the methods which they advocate.|$|E
