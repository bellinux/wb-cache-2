25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. <b>The</b> float lifts upward toward the bottom of <b>the</b> inverted <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> float at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough <b>fuel</b> in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve open, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump continues pumping <b>fuel</b> into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, where <b>the</b> resulting excess <b>fuel</b> causes <b>the</b> fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

40|$|Oil spill cleanup in Arctic {{is usually}} done by in-situ burning. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> oil {{will have a}} very low initial {{temperature}} as well as cold boundaries. This study focuses on the variation of the mass burning rate of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> with varying initial temperatures of <b>the</b> <b>fuel,</b> which is kept in a metal bowl surrounded by ice. Kerosene is chosen as <b>the</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> bowl diameters have been varied from 30 mm to around 50 mm. <b>The</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl is kept surrounded in an ice bath and is ignited after it attains a particular temperature. The initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is varied from 4 o C to 16 o C. Experiments are carried out for 5 minutes after which the flame is quenched. The results show that with increase in the initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>the</b> mass burning rate also increases. The mass burning rate also increases as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl diameter increases. The surface temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel,</b> just after quenching, increases with an increase in the initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> ignition time of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is reduced with increase in initial temperature of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> and with increase in bowl diameter.

5|$|Leopold was keen {{to find an}} {{accommodation}} with Germany in 1940, hoping that Belgium would remain as a unified and semi-autonomous state within a German-dominated Europe. As part of this plan, in November 1940, Leopold visited Adolf Hitler, the Führer of Germany, in Berchtesgaden to ask for Belgian prisoners of war to be freed. An agreement was not reached and Leopold returned to Belgium. This <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> belief that Leopold, who had expressed anti-Semitic views before the war, was collaborating with the Nazis rather than defending his country's interests.|$|E
5|$|The European immigrant-owned bookstores <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> {{demand for}} detective fiction, {{historical}} reading, and periodicals from Germany and England. Steimatzky, which opened its first bookstore on Jaffa Road in the Triangle in 1925, identified the growing taste for imported {{newspapers and magazines}} and bought the franchises for many of them. The European immigrants also created a market for cold cuts and cheeses, with three competing delicatessens on King George and Ben Yehuda Streets. For many years, the Triangle was also {{the only place where}} Jerusalem residents could purchase clothing, shoes, furniture, and household goods.|$|E
5|$|The film spawned {{critical}} commentary in a {{broad spectrum}} of media outlets which include leading newspapers such as The New York Times, The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post; leading periodicals such as Forbes; online forums such as Slate; and leading news outlets such as MSNBC.

5|$|The wave of anti-Chinese {{violence}} in the western United States following the Rock Springs Riot spread further, {{to the state of}} Oregon. Mobs drove Chinese workers out of small towns throughout the state in late 1885 and mid-1886. Other states reported incidents as well: As far away as Augusta, Georgia, anger was expressed against the Chinese in response to the massacre at Rock Springs. According to The New York Times, the rioting in Rock Springs <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> desire of anti-Chinese Georgians in Augusta to air their grievances.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{conditions}} set out by Tikhon's decree for this temporary autonomy not being met, the American diocese of the Russian church declared self-governance in 1924, against the protests of the patriarchate, {{with which it}} had communication and which was capable of governance had its American branch been willing. The refusal of the American branch {{to submit to the}} patriarchate thus based itself officially on a document whose conditions it had not met. In reality, however, it was a fear of Communism and a belief that the patriarchate had been compromised which <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> rebellion, paired with a desire {{on the part of the}} Metropolia to dissociate itself from the Russian Orthodox Church Outside Russia (ROCOR) of which it had been part.|$|E
5|$|During the {{oil boom}} of the 1970s, Nigeria joined OPEC and the huge oil {{revenues}} it was generating enriched the economy. Despite these revenues, the military government did little to improve {{the standard of living}} of the population, help small and medium businesses, or invest in infrastructure. As oil revenues <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> rise of federal subsidies to states, the federal government became the centre of political struggle and the threshold of power in the country. As oil production and revenue rose, the Nigerian government became increasingly dependent on oil revenues and on international commodity markets for budgetary and economic concerns. It did not develop alternate revenue sources in the economy for economic stability. That spelled doom to federalism in Nigeria.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible <b>fuel</b> pump in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. Moving <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump to <b>the</b> interior of the tank helps prevent vapor lock, since <b>the</b> entire <b>fuel</b> delivery system is under positive pressure and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump runs cooler than if it {{is located in the}} engine compartment. This is the primary reason that vapor lock is rare in modern <b>fuel</b> systems.

5|$|Life in {{the colony}} was perilous, and many died during the Starving Time in 1609 and the Anglo-Powhatan Wars, {{including}} the Indian massacre of 1622, which fostered the colonists' negative view of all tribes. By 1624, only 3,400of the 6,000early settlers had survived. However, European demand for tobacco <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> arrival of more settlers and servants. The headright system tried to solve the labor shortage by providing colonists with land for each indentured servant they transported to Virginia. African workers were first imported to Jamestown in 1619 initially under the rules of indentured servitude. The shift {{to a system of}} African slavery in Virginia was propelled by the legal cases of John Punch, who was sentenced to lifetime slavery in 1640 for attempting to run away, and of John Casor, who was claimed by Anthony Johnson as his servant for life in 1655. Slavery first appears in Virginia statutes in 1661 and 1662, when a law made it hereditary based on the mother's status.|$|E
5|$|A major {{development}} {{in the second half}} of the 19th century was a rapid expansion of paleontology in North America. In 1858 Joseph Leidy described a Hadrosaurus skeleton, which was the first North American dinosaur to be described from good remains. However, it was the massive westward expansion of railroads, military bases, and settlements into Kansas and other parts of the Western United States following the American Civil War that really <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> expansion of fossil collection. The result was an increased understanding of the natural history of North America, including the discovery of the Western Interior Sea that had covered Kansas and much of the rest of the Midwestern United States during parts of the Cretaceous, the discovery of several important fossils of primitive birds and horses, and the discovery of a number of new dinosaur genera including Allosaurus, Stegosaurus, and Triceratops. Much of this activity was part of a fierce personal and professional rivalry between two men, Othniel Marsh, and Edward Cope, which has become known as the Bone Wars.|$|E
5|$|By 1940, {{the average}} {{production}} {{cost of an}} American feature was $400,000, a negligible increase over ten years. A number of small Hollywood companies had folded {{around the turn of}} the decade, including the ambitious Grand National, but a new firm, Producers Releasing Corporation (PRC), emerged as third in the Poverty Row hierarchy behind Republic and Monogram. The double feature, never universal, was still the prevailing exhibition model: in 1941, 50 percent of theaters were double-billing exclusively, and others employed the policy part-time. In the early 1940s, legal pressure forced the studios to replace seasonal block booking with packages generally limited to five pictures. Restrictions were also placed on the majors' ability to enforce blind bidding. These were crucial factors in the progressive shift by most of the Big Five over to A-film production, making the smaller studios even more important as B movie suppliers. Genre pictures made at very low cost remained the backbone of Poverty Row, with even Republic's and Monogram's budgets rarely climbing over $200,000. Many smaller Poverty Row firms folded as the eight majors, with their proprietary distribution exchanges, now commanded about 95 percent of U.S. and Canadian box office receipts. In 1946, independent producer David O. Selznick brought his bloated-budget spectacle Duel in the Sun to market with heavy nationwide promotion and wide release. The distribution strategy was a major success, despite what was widely perceived as the movie's poor quality. The Duel release anticipated practices that <b>fueled</b> <b>the</b> B movie industry in the late 1950s; when the top Hollywood studios made them standard two decades after that, the B movie would be hard hit.|$|E
