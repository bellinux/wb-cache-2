40|$|Seamless {{garments}} {{are popular}} knitted products nowadays. They {{are widely used}} as power stretchable underwear, outerwear and sportswear for which the use of high elastic yarns is indispensable. For seamless garments knitted with circular seamless machines, polyurethane (PU) /polyamide (PA) core-spun yarn is commonly used as the base yarn in a plating fabric to enhance the elasticity of the garment. However, the use of PU/PA core-spun yarn has encountered some problems, such as the difficulty in size control and the ageing of PU elastic yarn. In this study, the polytrimethylene terephthalate (PTT) /polyester (PET) bi-component filament was used to replace the PU/PA core-spun yarn {{for the development of}} seamless garments due to its excellent extensibility and elastic recovery property. The manufacturing processes, including knitting, pre-treatment, dyeing and finishing, were developed, and the end-use performance of the fabrics, which were respectively produced with the PTT/PET bi-component filament and PU/PA core-spun yarn as the base yarn and PA fiber as the <b>face</b> <b>yarn</b> for seamless garments, was compared based on the five different mechanical and physical properties. The results show that the fabric made of the PTT/PET bi-component filament has much better dimensional stability, much better elastic recovery property and much better wrinkle resistance than those of the fabric made of PU/PA core-spun yarn. It is expected that this study could help us to further exploit the use of the PTT/PET bi-component filament in the development of seamless garments in the future.

40|$|The {{presented}} paper {{relates to}} the field of “smart textiles”. A new type of knitted strain sensing elements (knitted resistive fabric (KRF)) which can be integrated in the smart garment was developed. KRF was produced from conductive resistive, nonconductive isolating and nonconductive elastomeric yarns. Elastomeric yarn was used as the base yarn and was knitted within the whole fabric, but isolating and resistive yarns (functional yarns) were used as <b>face</b> <b>yarns</b> and knitted in specific sequence. Electrical model of KRF is proposed to describe the behavior of sensing element. The developed KRF has high sensitivity to strain deformation and can be used as local strain sensor or distributed resistive sensing field to control deformation of human body parts, joint motion, respiration etc...|$|R

Sportswear should possess good moisture transmission property. Moisture flow through various materials is a complex phenomenon as in three-thread fleece knitted fabric produced with different <b>face</b> and fleecy <b>yarn</b> material. So, in this study, nine three-thread fleece fabrics of different composition materials have been studied, where these knitted fabrics are produced in a special circular knitted machine. The developed fabrics are taken to measure, water vapor permeability “WVP”, gain%, air permeability, drying time, color difference, immersion time and bursting strength.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper,the 5 {{types of}} fabrics were knitted by plain-plated, 1 + 1 and 1 + 3 float-plated, 1 + 1 and 2 + 2 tuck-plate stitch and density P 6,which {{are made of}} cooldry {{absorption}} and quick-drying polyester <b>yarns</b> as the <b>facing</b> <b>yarn</b> and the core-spun spandex yarn of nylon as the ground yarns. The absorption and quick-drying were tested and analyzed. The significance of influence of fabric textures and stretch on absorption and quick-drying was analyzed by means of two variance analysis. Results show that the influence of texture and stretch on absorption and quick-drying are significant. The absorption and spreading speed and the accumulative one-way transport capacity of 1 + 3 and 1 + 1 float-plated and 2 + 2 tuck-plated fabric are bigger. As the fabric texture is the same, the absorption and spreading speed are smaller and the accumulative one-way transport capacity are worse {{with the increase of}} fabrics stretch. The research results can provide a certain reference for the design & development and choice of seamless underwear...|$|R

40|$|Textile {{materials}} are usually exposed to thermal, physical and mechanical effects during treatment processes. These influence the changes of material dimensions. Designing knitted products {{it is important}} to predict direction and rate of dimensions change, because this can affect physical properties such as air permeability of knits. The objective of this research was to investigate the influence of antimicrobial treatment conditions on the structure characteristics, thickness and air permeability of plain and plaited knits. The investigations were carried out with two groups of plain and plated single jersey knits. The <b>face</b> <b>yarns</b> of these groups were cotton, bamboo viscose yarn and polyester (Dacron®) thread. 10 tex × 2 textured polyamide (PA) and 20 tex textured polyester (PES) threads were used as the base threads in plated knits. Knitted samples were treated with antimicrobial material Isys AG and organic-inorganic binder Isys MTX (CHT, Germany). It was established that blank and antimicrobial treated knits changed structure parameters, thickness and air permeability. The changes of structure parameters, thickness and air permeability were more associated with conditions of treatment (temperature, treatment in solution, mechanical action) rather than with antimicrobial and sol-gel substances used in treatment.

40|$|The present {{invention}} provides compositions {{and processes}} wherein recycling of waste carpets and textiles {{is achieved by}} coating the individual yarn fibers with a low viscosity adhesive that is dispersed or dissolved in a suitable solvent to affect coverage of the fine fibers, and arranging the coated fibers in layers to affect the most desirable physical properties and then cured to provide a high modulus matrix for the coated fibers in the laminate structure. The fibers may be from unshredded or shredded waste carpets, shredded waste woven or non woven fabrics, fabric bits, and knitted fabrics. When the carpet is used in an as received condition, the <b>face</b> <b>yarns,</b> which may contain one or more components yarns, are coated and the carpets are arranged in a sandwich construction wherein the backings of the two carpets are placed back-to-back, e. g., (F-B-(B-F) n -B-F, (n= 0 or an integer value, F=face yarn and B=backing) and then heated under applied pressure to affect a cure of the resin coating and the adhesion between carpet backing layers. The resulting laminate consists of two outer fibrous layers that contains the unmelted yarns bundles from the carpet in a high modulus matrix. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|R
30|$|Moreover, {{the figures}} show that in the warp wise {{direction}} reduction in stiffness is higher as compared to weft direction. This {{could be attributed to}} the construction of fabrics which were 2 ends up warp face twill weave. As a result warp <b>yarns</b> <b>face</b> higher amount of friction than weft yarns. The figures also shows that trend of reduction in stiffness in both warp and weft way direction treated with both the enzymes are similar for indigo and sulphur dyed denims. This may be because the effect of enzymes on stiffness is independent of the dye applied to the fabric.|$|R
5000|$|Antique satin was {{developed}} in the 1950s by combining acetate (warp threads) and rayon (weft threads) mainly as a decorative fabric used primarily for draperies. Unlike wedding satin with the shiny weave visible, antique satin is made of small slubs or textures on the <b>face.</b> The <b>yarn</b> most popular was known as 19/2 ply, meaning 19 threads to the inch woven as a two ply thread to create an attractive silk-like appearance. The popular, quality style is 48" [...] wide and first appeared in limited colors. In the late 1950s a company named Penco Fabrics, owned by Jack Penzer, and based at the drapery building, 261 Fifth Avenue, NY, NY, introduced antique satin in 101 colors, virtually revolutionizing the industry. The fabric was copied by others including Fame Fabrics and Richloom, a major supplier today, and by 1963 achieved major distribution throughout the United States. Selling at the mill level for $.59 to $.79 a yard, whether in the natural off-white, undyed, fabric to black and colored warp yards with an iridescent effect at the higher price points, the fabric in its basic form remains somewhat popular today.|$|R

The insect resist treatment of wool carpet yarn hanks with permethrin based agents in a modified centrifugal hydroextractor is described. The distribution of insect resist agent adsorbed by the rotating load is {{discussed in terms of}} the influence of the emulsification system used to disperse permethrin into the aqueous treatment liquor. Macroemulsion based systems are shown to produce an unlevel treatment {{as a result of their}} preferential adsorption at the <b>face</b> of the <b>yarn</b> load, while microemulsion based systems are shown to result in an even distribution of permethrin throughout the load. The attainable effective yarn to liquor ratio and permethrin load in the spent liquor from the proposed system are shown to compare favourably with those obtainable in conventional and alternative low volume insect resist treatment systems...|$|R
40|$|Yarn {{shooting}} {{experiments were}} conducted to determine the ballistically-relevant, Young’s modulus and tensile strength of ultra-high molecular weight polyethylene (UHMWPE) fiber. Target specimens were Dyneema® SK 76 yarns (1760 dtex), twisted to 40 turns/m, and initially tensioned to stresses ranging from 29 to 2200 MPa. Yarns were impacted, transversely, by two types of cylindrical steel projectiles at velocities ranging from 150 to 555 m/s: (i) a reverse-fired, fragment simulating projectile (FSP) where the flat rear <b>face</b> impacted the <b>yarn</b> rather than the beveled nose; and (ii) a ‘saddle-nosed projectile’ having a specially contoured nose imparting circular curvature {{in the region of}} impact, but opposite curvature transversely to prevent yarn slippage off the nose. Experimental data consisted of sequential photographic images of the progress of the triangular transverse wave, as well as tensile wave speed measured using spaced, piezo-electric sensors. Yarn Young’s modulus, calculated from the tensile wave-speed, varied from 133 GPa at minimal initial tension to 208 GPa at the highest initial tensions. However, varying projectile impact velocity, and thus, the strain jump on impact, had negligible effect on the modulus. Contrary to predictions from the classical Cole-Smith model for 1 D yarn impact, the critical velocity for yarn failure differed significantly for the two projectile types, being 18 % lower for the flat-faced, reversed FSP projectile compared to the saddle-nosed projectile, which converts to an apparent 25 % difference in yarn strength. To explain this difference, a wave-propagation model was developed that incorporates tension wave collision under blunt impact by a flat-faced projectile, in contrast to outward wave propagation in the classical model. Agreement between experiment and model predictions was outstanding across a wide range of initial yarn tensions. However, plots of calculated failure stress versus yarn pre-tension stress resulted in apparent yarn strengths much lower than 3. 4 GPa from quasi-static tension tests, although a plot of critical velocity versus initial tension did project to 3. 4 GPa at zero velocity. This strength reduction (occurring also in aramid fibers) suggested that transverse fiber distortion and yarn compaction from a compressive shock wave under the projectile results in fiber-on-fiber interference in the emerging transverse wave front, causing a gradient in fiber tensile strains with depth, and strain concentration in fibers nearest the projectile face. A model was developed to illustrate the phenomenon...|$|R
