5|$|Even {{before the}} {{appearance}} of Barber's sketches, other designs were being considered for the half dollar. In early August, artist Frank Millet proposed to the fair's Director of Decorations, Olin Warner, that Warner design the coin. Warner modeled one depicting a profile of Columbus, not based on the Lotto portrait. His reverse showed a caravel ship, symbolizing the Santa María, Columbus's flagship, above two globes representing the hemispheres, though they lacked the continental outlines. Warner's proposal was praised by artists working on their sculptures at the fairgrounds. Leech also weighed <b>in</b> <b>once</b> he returned from vacation on August 26, sending fair organizers a woodcut engraving based on the official Spanish medal for the 400th anniversary of Columbus' first voyage, and arranging with the State Department for the American Embassy in Madrid to get one. A medal was duly obtained and was subsequently placed in the Mint's collection.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} loosely styled after Akira Kurosawa's 1954 film Seven Samurai, and drew heavily from the {{conventions}} of Westerns, especially Sergio Leone's Spaghetti Westerns such as Once Upon a Time in the West (1968), and John Sturges' film The Magnificent Seven (1960). Sholay was also influenced by the westerns of Sam Peckinpah, such as The Wild Bunch (1969) and Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973); and by George Roy Hill's Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid (1969). A scene depicting an attempted train robbery {{was inspired by a}} similar scene in North West Frontier (1959), and a scene showing the massacre of Thakur's family has been compared with the massacre of the McBain family <b>in</b> <b>Once</b> Upon a Time in the West. Some plot elements were borrowed from the Indian films Mera Gaon Mera Desh (1971) and Khote Sikkay (1973).|$|E

5|$|Robert Zemeckis, the director, {{originally}} wanted Fox to play Marty, but Gary David Goldberg {{the creator}} of Family Ties, which Fox was working on at the time, refused to allow Zemeckis even to approach Fox as he felt that as Meredith Baxter was on maternity leave at the time, Fox's character Alex Keaton was needed to carry the show in her absence. Eric Stoltz was cast and was already filming Back to the Future, but Zemeckis felt that Stoltz was not giving the right type of performance for the humor involved. Zemeckis quickly replaced Stoltz with Fox, whose schedule was now more open {{with the return of}} Meredith Baxter. He was considered for the role of Mark Kendall <b>in</b> <b>Once</b> Bitten, but it eventually went to Jim Carrey. During filming, Fox would rehearse for Family Ties from 10 a.m to 6 p.m, then rush to the Back to the Future set where he would rehearse and shoot until 2:30a.m. This schedule lasted for two full months. Back to the Future was both a commercial and critical success. The film spent 8 consecutive weekends as the number-one grossing movie at the US box office in 1985 and eventually earned a worldwide total of $381.11 million. Variety applauded the performances, stating that Fox and his co-star Christopher Lloyd imbued Marty and Doc Brown's friendship with a quality reminiscent of King Arthur and Merlin. The film was later followed by two similarly-successful sequels, Back to the Future Part II (1989) and Back to the Future Part III (1990).|$|E

25|$|With all {{survivors}} {{floating on}} the water with no life vests, co-pilot Carlton suddenly noticed that a Mrs Thorburn was hanging on to a raft still in its case.

Although Blown and passenger Peter Thacher kept watch, the attacking planes never returned.|$|E
25|$|From the {{beginning}} of his career in 1935 through his last projects in 1981, Fonda appeared in 106 films, television programs, and shorts.

25|$|On July 1, 2004, Brando died of {{respiratory}} failure from pulmonary fibrosis with {{congestive heart failure}} at the UCLA Medical Center. He left behind 14 children (two of his children, Cheyenne and Dylan Brando, had predeceased him), as well as over 30 grandchildren. He was also survived by his sister Jocelyn. The {{cause of death was}} initially withheld, with his lawyer citing privacy concerns. He also suffered from failing eyesight caused by diabetes and liver cancer. Shortly before his death and despite needing an oxygen mask to breathe, he recorded his voice to appear <b>in</b> , <b>once</b> again as Don Vito Corleone. However, Brando only recorded one line due to his health and an impersonator was hired to finish his lines. Some lines from his character were directly lifted from the film.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{his more}} notable oddities {{included}} a diet to supplement his extreme fitness regime, which consisted largely of tea, biscuits, and baked beans. Like his mentor, Alan Knott, a heavy tea drinker, Russell would often get through 20 cups a day. He used to dip the tea bag <b>in</b> <b>once,</b> add plenty of milk, then hang it on a nail ready for subsequent use. In the final Test of the 1989 Ashes series (against Australia) at the Oval, Derek Randall counted that he used the same bag for all five days, which roughly equates to 100 cups. For lunch, Russell would eat two Weetabix, soaked for exactly eight minutes in milk, and a mashed banana. For dinner, steak and chips or chicken without skin was a favourite meal – Russell once spent every night of a Test at a Chinese restaurant in Perth, ordering cashew chicken: without the cashews.|$|E

25|$|NY235 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY7 alongside the Wylie Brook in Colesville. The route progresses northward, crossing under a railroad viaduct, crossing the county line out of Broome County into Chenango County. After crossing the county line, NY235 enters {{the town of}} Afton, passing some residences and paralleling the aforementioned brook. The route remains mainly rural, winding northward through Afton, passing some homes near Davey-Mendenhall Road. Continuing brook-side, NY235, entering the town of Coventry, intersects with Ives Road before crossing over Wiley Brook just north of it. Ives Road soon turns to the northwest, merging back into NY235. The rural backdrop does not change along the roadway, crossing over Wiley Brook once more. Davey-Mendenhall Road merges <b>in</b> <b>once</b> again further north, where the route turns to the northwest, intersecting with County Route30 (CR30; Smith Road). The route makes a bend to the northeast, passing several farmlands, before entering downtown Coventry, where NY235 intersects with NY41 and NY206. This intersection serves as the northern terminus of NY235.|$|E
25|$|Unique to the Teaching of Addai, {{the exact}} list of Petrine apostolic {{succession}} reoccurs {{at the end}} of the Martyrdom of Barsamya. Also unique to the Teaching of Addai, the names of Addai's first Christian converts are mentioned in both the Acts of Sharbel and the Martyrdom of Barsamya. Inscriptions of these names can be found <b>in</b> <b>once</b> pagan regions of Edessa dating back to the fourth and third century AD and are rarely mentioned in Syriac sources from the fifth century AD and after. According to scholar Harold Attridge, Addai's first Christian converts mentioned in the Martyrdom of Barsamya and the Acts of Sharbel were incorporated in a literary writing style similar to that of the Acts of Shmona and Gurya and the Martyrdom of Habbib. With such similarities, he deduced that the Acts of Sharbel and the Martyrdom of Barsamya were written by the same group of pagan authors inspired to integrate their ancestral pagan ideology into the Christian community through the use of the Sharbel and Barsamya texts.|$|E
25|$|After {{having his}} ships {{refitted}} Knowles sailed on a cruise, hoping to intercept a Spanish treasure fleet off Cuba. On 30 September {{he fell in}} with HMS Lenox, under Captain Charles Holmes, who {{reported that he had}} encountered a Spanish fleet some days earlier. The fleet was sighted the next morning but confusion over signals and a struggle to keep the weather gauge meant that the British fleet failed to attack in an organised manner. Though the Battle of Havana ended with the capture of one Spanish ship and another being badly damaged, it was not the major British victory hoped for. Knowles was accused of badly mismanaging the action and faced a court martial in December 1749. The result was a reprimand for the poor tactics he employed, while several of the other captains involved were also reprimanded. There was considerable bad feeling between Knowles and his subordinates, and several challenges to duel were issued. <b>In</b> <b>once</b> instance Knowles exchanged shots with Holmes, and in another two of his captains, Innes and Clarke, duelled, which resulted in Innes being mortally wounded. King George II eventually intervened to forbid any more duels over the matter.|$|E
