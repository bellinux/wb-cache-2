5|$|Different species use {{different}} pheromones. Scarab beetles {{such as the}} Rutelinae use pheromones derived from fatty acid synthesis, while other scarabs such as the Melolonthinae use amino acids and terpenoids. Another way beetles find mates {{is seen in the}} fireflies (Lampyridae) which are bioluminescent, with abdominal light-producing organs. The males and females engage <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> dialogue before mating; each species has a unique combination of flight patterns, duration, composition, and intensity of the light produced.|$|E
5|$|Egyptian deities are {{connected}} <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> and shifting array of relationships. A god's connections and interactions with other deities helped define its character. Thus Isis, {{as the mother}} and protector of Horus, was a great healer {{as well as the}} patroness of kings. Such relationships were the base material from which myths were formed.|$|E

5|$|TCDD is {{the most}} potent {{compound}} (congener) of its series (polychlorinated dibenzodioxins, known as PCDDs or simply dioxins) and became known as a contaminant in Agent Orange, a herbicide used in the Vietnam War.

5|$|The {{inner ear}} sits within the {{temporal}} bone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> cavity called the bony labyrinth. A central area known as the vestibule contains two small fluid-filled recesses, the utricle and saccule. These connect to the semicircular canals and the cochlea. There are three semicircular canals angled {{at right angles to}} each other which are responsible for dynamic balance. The cochlea is a spiral shell-shaped organ responsible for the sense of hearing. These structures together create the membranous labyrinth.|$|E
5|$|The motions as {{described}} above are simplifications. Due to the movement of Earth around the Earth–Moon center of mass, the apparent path of the Sun wobbles slightly, with {{a period of about}} one month. Due to further perturbations by the other planets of the Solar System, the Earth–Moon barycenter wobbles slightly around a mean position <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> fashion.

5|$|By {{the second}} {{decade of the}} 21st century, the overall {{consensus}} supported the position {{that there was only}} a single author who was writing either {{at the end of the}} 4th century or the beginning of the 5th century, and who was interested in blending contemporary issues (political, religious and social) into the lives of the 3rd century emperors. Further, that the author used the fictitious elements in the work to highlight references to other published works, such as to Cicero and Ammianus Marcellinus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> allegorical game. Despite these conundrums, it is the only continuous account in Latin for much of its period and is thus continually being re-evaluated, since modern historians are unwilling to abandon it as a unique source of possible information, despite its obvious untrustworthiness on many levels.|$|E

5|$|Frog {{mutations}} {{and genetic}} defects have increased since the 1990s. These often include missing legs or extra legs. Various causes {{have been identified}} or hypothesized, including an increase in ultraviolet radiation affecting the spawn {{on the surface of}} ponds, chemical contamination from pesticides and fertilizers, and parasites such as the trematode Ribeiroia ondatrae. Probably all these are involved <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> way as stressors, environmental factors contributing to rates of disease, and vulnerability to attack by parasites. Malformations impair mobility and the individuals may not survive to adulthood. An {{increase in the number of}} frogs eaten by birds may actually increase the likelihood of parasitism of other frogs, because the trematode's complex lifecycle includes the ramshorn snail and several intermediate hosts such as birds.|$|E
5|$|From the Early Preclassic, Maya {{society was}} sharply {{divided between the}} elite and commoners. As {{population}} increased over time, various sectors of society became increasingly specialized, and political organization became increasingly complex. By the Late Classic, when populations had grown enormously and hundreds of cities were connected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> web of political hierarchies, the wealthy segment of society multiplied. A middle class may have developed that included artisans, low ranking priests and officials, merchants, and soldiers. Commoners included farmers, servants, labourers, and slaves. According to indigenous histories, land was held communally by noble houses or clans. Such clans held that the land was {{the property of the}} clan ancestors, and such ties between the land and the ancestors were reinforced by the burial of the dead within residential compounds.|$|E
5|$|Open water {{fish are}} usually {{streamlined}} like torpedoes to minimize turbulence {{as they move}} through the water. Reef fish live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex,</b> relatively confined underwater landscape and for them, manoeuvrability {{is more important than}} speed, and many of them have developed bodies which optimize their ability to dart and change direction. Many have laterally compressed bodies (flattened from side to side) allowing them to fit into fissures and swim through narrow gaps; some use their pectoral fins for locomotion and others undulate their dorsal and anal fins. Some fish have grown dermal (skin) appendages for camouflage; the prickly leather-jacket is almost invisible among the seaweed it resembles and the tasselled scorpionfish invisibly lurks on the seabed ready to ambush prey. Some like the foureye butterflyfish have eyespots to startle or deceive, while others such as lionfish have aposematic coloration to warn that they are toxic or have venomous spines.|$|E

5|$|Silicon nitride {{has long}} been used in {{high-temperature}} applications.

To demonstrate this capability <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>complex</b> configuration, NASA scientists used advanced rapid prototyping technology to fabricate a one-inch-diameter, single-piece combustion chamber/nozzle (thruster) component.
