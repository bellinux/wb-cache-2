40|$|In this paper, we used cloud imagery from a NASA field {{experiment}} {{in conjunction with}} three-dimensional radiative transfer calculations to show that cloud spatial structure manifests itself as a spectral signature in shortwave irradiance fields – specifically in transmittance and net <b>horizontal</b> photon <b>transport</b> in the visible and near-ultraviolet wavelength range. We found a robust correlation between the magnitude of net <b>horizontal</b> photon <b>transport</b> (H) and its spectral dependence (slope), which is scale-invariant and holds for the entire pixel population of a domain. This was surprising at first given the large degree of spatial inhomogeneity. We prove that the underlying physical mechanism for this phenomenon is molecular scattering in conjunction with cloud spatial structure. On this basis, we developed a simple parameterization through a single parameter ε, which quantifies the characteristic spectral signature of spatial inhomogeneities. In the case we studied, neglecting net <b>horizontal</b> photon <b>transport</b> leads to a local transmittance bias of ± 12 – 19  %, even at the relatively coarse spatial resolution of 20  km.

50|$|The most {{significant}} route of air entering the stratosphere {{is in the}} tropic through the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) via convection. Basically, the air masses have to be shifted by deeply convection in order to consider the common way into the stratosphere. The air lifted by a convection is able to increase several kilometers within a few hours, this transport mechanism is very fast enough for VSLS lifetimes. Because VSLS has a short life times, they distribute to the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere; for instance South America or the Maritime Continent. By the way. Nevertheless, the <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> for short-lived species is very essential as the far extending filaments. Obviously, the transport is efficiency for the different regions. The convection is not likely expanded but lean to be focus on separate areas. To illustrate the most efficient ways of VSLS into the stratosphere are divided by the globe into different areas with a single VSLS tracer. The contribution of a single region tracer to {{the total amount of}} this species provides information of the relative importance of this region regarding to the transport of VSLS. The results are given in the West Pacific dominates all other source regions.|$|E

Below this clear water minimum, SPM load gradually increases {{and often a}} dramatic increase is observed close to the seafloor, the benthic nepheloid layer (BNL). In the deep water and especially in this BNL, particles can be transported over very large distances. Thus, the BNL is affected by horizontal advection, fresh new particle rain and exchange with the surface sediment by the resuspension-settling cycle. Reversible particle-water exchange (scavenging and release) and grain size sorting will continue to adjust the distribution of trace elements and their isotopic composition over the particulate and dissolved phases.

40|$|Abstract. Current Lagrangian {{particle}} dispersion models, used {{to simulate}} the dispersion of passive tracers in the turbulent planetary boundary layer (PBL), assume that the density is constant within the PBL. In deep PBLs, where the density at the boundary-layer top may be lower by more than 20 % than at the surface, this assumption leads to errors in the tracer concentrations {{on the order of}} 10 %. In the presence of a vertical wind shear, this also leads to inaccurate calculations of the <b>horizontal</b> tracer <b>transport.</b> To remove this deficiency, a Langevin equation is presented that contains a density correction term. The effect of the density correction is studied using data from a large-scale tracer experiment.

40|$|Hurricanes produce {{mixing and}} flow divergences (and convergences) that alter the upper-ocean heat content (OHC), {{which in turn}} affects the storm. Ocean {{observations}} under a hurricane are rare, {{making it difficult to}} validate forecast models. Past research have mainly focused on OHC-changes by vertical mixing and tacitly assumed that <b>horizontal</b> <b>transports</b> are slowly-varying. Moreover, effects of coastal boundaries on ocean responses to hurricanes are generally omitted. This work uses satellite data to detect and verify forecast isopycnal motions under hurricane Wilma (Oct/ 16 - 26 / 2005) in the Caribbean Sea and the Gulf of Mexico. The model is then used to show that Wilma-induced convergences in northwestern Caribbean Sea produce increased Yucatan-Channel transport into the Gulf ahead of the storm, and the Yucatan-Loop Current front diverts most of this heat around the Loop. This response is distinct from that of an ocean without the Loop, for which warming is widespread north of the channel. These intricate ocean responses can impact hurricane predictions...|$|R

50|$|During the 17th century {{there were}} several {{measures}} taken to improve the situation {{and some of the}} mine shares were taken over by the state treasury but mining only developed very slowly after that. In the 18th century, the Slavkov and Krásno mining areas underwent a number of changes aimed at reconstructing the old mining works and reviving mining under a new policy. There was some modernization of operations, fundamental changes in mine drainage, <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport,</b> the introduction of trolleys and piece rates.

The necessity of making savings became evident and the relatively spendthrift activities in operation were soon restricted so that by the end of the 1670s they had come to a complete halt. Only one undertaking remained in continuous operation and this was progressively assigned to various owners and modernized. The proceeds from mining did not match the costs and so it went bankrupt several times. After the First World War, the significance of the Slavkov-Krásno mining area increased again; an especially promising area was the mining of wolfram ore and tin.

40|$|Transport {{collaboration}} {{has been}} applied in many different industries both on vertical and horizontal level; to improve transport performance and reduce transport costs. In the air cargo industry currently limited transport collaboration exists both on horizontal and vertical level for inner airport transport of freight forwarding companies. High growth rates and healthy operating margins had limited the need for extensive collaboration in the past. However due to changing dynamics of air cargo transport use and type of shipments that are transported at major established airport in Western Europe, like Schiphol airport, there is an increased focus on cost reductions and improved transport performance. Therefore <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration {{could be applied to}} improve the transport performance and costs for air cargo freight forwarders active at major airports. This research has tried to reveal the potential and main challenges of applying <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration at Schiphol airport for air cargo shipments. This research has combined both qualitative and qualitative methods to support the potential of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration within a large air cargo system, by combining analyses on different major cargo airports with both a case study simulation model and system analysis on specific shipment collaboration at Schiphol as a whole. The results {{of this study indicate that}} for many freight forwarding companies, supporting <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration could significantly improve transport costs and performance. However in order realize the potential benefits of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration; companies will have to transport shipments on regular basis that are suitable for transport collaboration. Also forwarding companies will have to be much more flexible and adaptive, regarding the use of different types of transport and the way shipments are collected/delivered, in order to make <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> successful based on costs and performance. With the expected lower growth rates of air cargo and more dynamic transport of air cargo shipments with lower operating margins at major established airports in Western Europe, <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration is also expected to be effective approach for coming decades. Given the existing overcapacity at most air cargo handlers at different airports and the reluctance of air cargo handlers to invest in more automated systems, due to uncertainty about air cargo growth. Besides this supporting <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration can also improve the relationships with air cargo handlers, forwarders and transport companies, which can make part of the air cargo transport more stable and effective. It can give the air cargo handler and forwarder the ability to offer different transport concepts to their customers. However to truly realize the full potential of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration, the use of <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> has to be frequently assessed and improved, due to changing shipment dynamics of the involved companies. Next to this the remaining single company transport use should also be adapted as well on regular basis, in order to improve the transport costs and performance of the complete transport system. Not all forwarding companies active at a major airport, will be willing or able to support either horizontal or vertical transport collaboration, therefore it is advised to assess the possibility for all air cargo handlers individually, at major airports, to apply segmentation on transport collaboration. This segmentation should be assessed regarding potential and the ability of companies to collaborate within a specific transport flow, between the warehouses of two or more companies. This means that both forwarders and air cargo handlers should support vertical and <b>horizontal</b> <b>transport</b> collaboration when it results in; higher benefits for their own organization, for the other involved stakeholders and all companies are able to effectively support the intended collaboration.

The results show that 2 -D effects increase multiyear 24 -hour average total solar absorption by about 4. 1 W/sq m, 1. 2 W/sq m, and 0. 3 W/sq m at a tropical, mid-latitude, and arctic site, respectively. However, 2 -D effects are often much larger than these average values, especially for high sun and for convective clouds.
