50|$|An ADC {{is defined}} by its {{bandwidth}} and its signal-to-noise ratio. The bandwidth of an ADC is characterized primarily by its sampling rate. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of an ADC is influenced by many factors, including the resolution, linearity and accuracy (how well the quantization levels match the true analog signal), aliasing and jitter. The <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of an ADC is often summarized {{in terms of its}} effective number of bits (ENOB), the number of bits of each measure it returns that are on average not noise. An ideal ADC has an ENOB equal to its resolution. ADCs are chosen to match the bandwidth and required signal-to-noise ratio of the signal to be quantized. If an ADC operates at a sampling rate greater than twice the bandwidth of the signal, then perfect reconstruction is possible given an ideal ADC and neglecting quantization error. The presence of quantization error limits the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of even an ideal ADC. However, <b>if</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of the ADC exceeds that of the input signal, its effects may be neglected resulting in an essentially perfect digital representation of the input signal.|$|R

40|$|Sensitivity and <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> are two {{important}} characteristics of sensory receptors in {{the nervous system}} that define the physiological role of these cells. Rod cells in the retina of a mouse {{have the ability to}} detect very dim lights by closing cyclic-gated nucleotide channels. This extreme sensitivity would be impractical <b>if</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> on these cells was limited. Adaptation is a process by which the sensitivity of the transduction cascade is adjusted so cells can function within broader ranges of stimuli. Electrical recordings of circulating currents have been used to show that in the presence of steady background light, rods are desensitized so that saturation doesn't occur, and they remain responsive to increments and decrements of illumination. Furthermore, changes in calcium concentration have been proposed to mediate modulations of various molecules within the transduction pathways. In this project, we investigated the time course of desensitization and recovery in adaptation using suction electrode recording. We were able to show, desensitization at various ranges of adapting light, as manifested by the fact that reduction in sensitivity acceleration of recovery is already present at 500 ms. We also demonstrated that in recovery from adaptation, sensitivity of the rod returns back to its dark-adapted levels within 2 seconds. The persistence of adaptation in the form of acceleration of recovery was present with extremely dim lights and the time constant of its recovery to dark-adapted levels was dependent on the intensity of the background light...|$|R
30|$|In {{order to}} obtain HDR images from a single image, new imaging methods were {{proposed}} recently [6 – 8]. In these methods, the image exposure is controlled pixel by pixel. For example, the exposure of a pixel is widely opened when the pixel observes a dark region, and the exposure is closed when the pixel observes a brighter region. By using this method, we can obtain appropriate images even <b>if</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of input scenes is very large. In order to achieve it, Mannami et al.[6] combined a liquid crystal on silicon (LCoS) device and an imaging sensor, in which each pixel of LCoS corresponds to each pixel of image sensor and exposure parameter of each pixel can be changed by controlling the transparency of LCoS pixels. Although this method is useful for obtaining HDR images, motion blur of input images cannot be suppressed completely when a dynamic scene has fast motion. In this paper, we propose a new HDR imaging method for obtaining unblurred HDR images. In our method, we control not the transparency of each pixel but its exposure time for controlling exposure conditions of each pixel. We call the imaging method as variable exposure time imaging. By using the variable exposure time imaging, the motion blur of images can be suppressed efficiently, and we can obtain clear HDR images from a single shot.|$|R
40|$|Efficient coding {{has been}} {{proposed}} as a first principle explaining neuronal response properties in the central nervous system. The shape of optimal codes, however, strongly depends on the natural limitations of the particular physical system. Here we investigate how optimal neuronal encoding strategies {{are influenced by the}} finite number of neurons N (place constraint), the limited decoding time window length T (time constraint), the maximum neuronal firing rate f(max) (power constraint), and the maximal average rate (f) (max) (energy constraint). While Fisher information provides a general lower bound for the mean squared error of unbiased signal reconstruction, its use to characterize the coding precision is limited. Analyzing simple examples, we illustrate some typical pitfalls and thereby show that Fisher information provides a valid measure for the precision of a code only <b>if</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> (f(min) T, f(max) T) is sufficiently large. In particular, we demonstrate that the optimal width of gaussian tuning curves depends on the available decoding time T. Within the broader class of unimodal tuning functions, {{it turns out that the}} shape of a Fisher-optimal coding scheme is not unique. We solve this ambiguity by taking the minimum mean square error into account, which leads to flat tuning curves. The tuning width, however, remains to be determined by energy constraints rather than by the principle of efficient coding...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze how optical {{pre-processing}} with polarizing filters and digital pre-processing with HDR imaging, may improve the automated 3 D modeling pipeline based on SFM and Image Matching, with special emphasis on optically non-cooperative surfaces of shiny or dark materials. Because of the automatic detection of homologous points, the presence of highlights due to shiny materials, or nearly uniform dark patches produced by low reflectance materials, may produce erroneous matching involving wrong 3 D point estimations, and consequently holes and topological errors on the mesh originated by the associated dense 3 D cloud. This is due to the limited <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of the 8 bit digital images that are matched each other for generating 3 D data.

40|$|Abrupt {{changes of}} {{luminance}} within a static visual dis-play almost always occur at borders between an object and its background, {{and the change}} of pattern of luminance {{across the surface of}} an object is often a cue as to the texture of the surface and to the object’s identity. Hence, the ability of the visual system to detect local changes in luminance (visual contrast) is important for object per-ception. The visual system, however, faces a particular challenge in the processing of luminance contrasts: The range of ambient contrast levels is larger than the range of contrasts that a cortical contrast-sensitive neuron is able to represent at one time. A contrast-sensitive unit responds to changes in luminance across its receptive field (the area of the retina that provides input to these units). Low lev-els of contrast do not activate the unit until its threshold value is reached. As contrast is raised above the threshold value, the unit’s rate of firing increases until it saturates, with the range between threshold and saturation (the unit’s <b>dynamic</b> <b>range)</b> typically being 1 / 10 to 1 / 5 as large as the range of contrasts typically found in visual scenes (Al-brecht & Hamilton, 1982; Frazor & Geisler, 2006). There-fore, <b>if</b> the <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> of a contrast-sensitive neuron were to be fixed, it would be unable to process most of the contrasts that would fall into its receptive field when the observer was scanning the visual scene. How then does the visual system operate over the en-tire range of contrasts present in the environment when it is composed of neurons whose <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> is much smaller? At least part of the answer {{can be found in the}} remarkable ability of the visual system to adjust the sen-sitivity of contrast-sensitive neurons to the local ambi-ent contrast level close to the unit’s receptive field. For example, if the local ambient contrast level changes from high to low, the visual system increases the sensitivity of the contrast-sensitive neurons. In other words, the unit’s contrast sensitivity is adjusted to permit it to function ef-fectively over a large range of ambient contrasts.

Therefore, a sensor with higher <b>dynamic</b> <b>range,</b> generally, produces higher quality images than one with lower <b>dynamic</b> <b>range.</b> This, however, {{is not necessarily the}} case when <b>dynamic</b> <b>range</b> enhancement schemes are used.
