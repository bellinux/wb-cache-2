5|$|Morgan {{had waited}} until her {{academic}} rank was secure before becoming pregnant. She {{had a son}} in 1923, {{the same year that}} she became a full professor. Colleagues were surprised when she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> as she had not mentioned being pregnant and she hid the physical evidence of her pregnancy with her long laboratory jacket. Morgan remembered the reaction of one male colleague when she told him the news; he said if she had five children like he did, she would have hardly noticed the new baby. Morgan's mother moved in with her and cared for the baby so that Morgan could work uninterrupted.|$|E
25|$|There is a {{story that}} Constance, being 40 after a {{marriage}} of 9 years, knew that many would question whether the child was really hers. Thus she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> in a pavilion tent in the market square of the town, and invited the town matrons to witness the birth. A few days later she returned to the town square and publicly breast-fed the infant. Later she was crowned as queen of Sicily.|$|E
500|$|Lecrae {{attended}} a conference after being invited by a friend, though Lecrae admits that his interest {{was to meet}} girls and experience the big city. When {{he arrived at the}} conference, Lecrae was awed by the performance of the Christian hip-hop group The Cross Movement. Lecrae says that he saw [...] "guys who had been shot from being in gangs, girls who were extremely promiscuous in the past, I see rappers, dancers and singers; I see people who came from the same background I came from, and they still embodied who they were culturally, but they were all in love with Jesus and I had never seen that before." [...] After hearing Pastor James White of Christ Our King Community Church speak on how Christians are bought with a price and the suffering that Jesus underwent in the Crucifixion, Lecrae says that he remembers articulating [...] "God get me out of this, don't kill me; do whatever {{you have to do to}} get me out of this, just don't kill me." [...] Later, Lecrae was driving on a highway when he turned too quickly and his car went into a roll. He had no seatbelt and the roof and windshield of the car caved in, his glasses were molded into the frame of the car, but he survived completely uninjured. Lecrae cites this incident as the one which convinced him to commit his life to Christ. Lecrae went back to his college, the University of North Texas, with a printed version of his testimony to pass out on campus. He started volunteering and performing at a juvenile detention center, and the reception he received convinced him that offering [...] "hope and encouragement" [...] through music was what he wanted to do. However, Lecrae still struggled in his faith − as revealed in [...] "Good, Bad, Ugly", in 2002 he impregnated a then-girlfriend. Rather than risk scandal, he and his girlfriend <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> aborted, a decision he says he now deeply regrets. In the same song, he revealed that he had been sexually abused by a babysitter as a child.|$|E

2500|$|Kat {{returned}} to the show on 7 June 2012. Wallace praised EastEnders writers for bringing back Kat's funny and feisty attitude. Wallace added that it's like going home to her family and that she has missed Shane Richie. Wallace further explained: [...] "Before [...] break, I <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> swap story and {{towards the end of}} last year, Kat was becoming very downtrodden. Now she's coming back fighting fit. It's almost like when Kat first arrived on screen in 2000. She's come back with those original feisty, tarty, funny and a bit cold sides to her. It's a new Kat." ...|$|E
6000|$|Then {{a sudden}} fear came over her. What {{if it was}} ill, and {{they were trying to}} soothe it to rest! How much better she could do that if she only <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby!</b> ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Poor Aunt Jane!” sighed Louise. “I wish I {{could say}} {{something}} to prove that I revere her memory. <b>Had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> been a boy, its name would have been John; but being a girl I named her for Uncle John’s sister—the highest compliment I could conceive.” ...|$|E

60|$|I {{advanced}} {{towards the}} noise, {{and found myself}} standing before {{the open door of}} a large store-room at the extreme end of the passage. In {{the middle of the room}} (issuing household commodities to the cook) sat Mrs. Finch. She was robed this time in a petticoat and a shawl; and she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> and the novel laid together flat on their backs in her lap.|$|E
60|$|More pleased than {{he dared}} confess to {{himself with the}} praise of this common girl, Mr. James North assented. Then would he see the baby? He would, and Trinidad Joe having already seen the baby, and talked of the baby, and felt the baby, and indeed <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> offered to him in every way during the past night, {{concluded}} to give some of his valuable time to logging, and left them together.|$|E
60|$|The boys, having eaten {{everything}} there {{was on the}} breakfast-table, began now to take some thought of the case; and, seeing their mother crying, and their father looking very sad, began to whimper and put their hands to their eyes. Uncle Tom <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> on his knee, and was letting her enjoy herself to the utmost extent, scratching his face and pulling his hair, and occasionally breaking out into clamorous explosions of delight, evidently arising out of her own internal reflections.|$|E

60|$|THE {{greatest}} mystery about a {{human being}} is not his reaction to sex or praise, but {{the manner in which}} he contrives to put in twenty-four hours a day. It is this which puzzles the long-shoreman about the clerk, the Londoner about the bushman. It was this which puzzled Carol in regard to the married Vida. Carol herself <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> a larger house to care for, all the telephone calls for Kennicott when he was away; and she read everything, while Vida was satisfied with newspaper headlines.|$|E
60|$|From {{where he}} sat, he looked {{straight}} up {{the garden to}} the house. The blind was not drawn in the middle kitchen, {{he could see the}} figures of his wife and one child. There was a light also in the upstairs window. His wife was gone upstairs again. He wondered if she <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> ill. He could see her figure vaguely behind the lace curtains of the bedroom. It was like looking at his home through the wrong end of a telescope. Now the little girls had gone from the middle room: only to return in a moment.|$|E
60|$|Mrs Carbonel dreaded these cries {{almost as}} much as the mob itself for her {{delicate}} child, and went on talking to her and saying all the nursery rhymes that would come into her head, walking as fast as she could without making her pace felt, though the little maid--albeit small and thin for five years old--was a heavy weight to carry for some distance over a rough stubble field for unaccustomed arms. Tirzah <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby,</b> who happily was too young to be even disturbed in his noontide sleep, and Rachel Mole had tarried with the other maids, unable to resist her curiosity to see what was doing at the farm since they were out of reach.|$|E

6000|$|... "Venters {{got out of}} Utah, of course, as you know," [...] went on Shefford. [...] "He got out, knowing--as I feel I {{would have}} known--that Jane, Lassiter, and little Fay Larkin were shut up, walled up in Surprise Valley. For years Venters {{considered}} {{it would not have}} been safe for him to venture to rescue them. He had no fears for their lives. They could live in Surprise Valley. But Venters always intended to come back with Bess and find the valley and his friends. No wonder he and Bess were haunted. However, when his wife <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> that made a difference. It meant he had to go alone. And he was thinking seriously of starting when--when there were developments that made it desirable for me to leave Beaumont. Venters's story haunted me as he had been haunted. I dreamed of that wild valley--of little Fay Larkin grown to womanhood--such a woman as Bess Venters was. And the longing to come was great.... And, Withers--here I am." ...|$|E
6000|$|He reached Harrington Hall in the {{afternoon}} about four, and found Lady Chiltern alone. As {{soon as he saw}} her he told himself that she was not in the least altered since he had last been with her, and yet during the period she had undergone that great change which turns a girl into a mother. She <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> with her when he came into the room, and at once greeted him as an old friend,--as a loved and loving friend who was to be made free at once to all the inmost privileges of real friendship, which are given to and are desired by so few. [...] "Yes, here we are again," [...] said Lady Chiltern, [...] "settled, as far as I suppose we ever shall be settled, for ever so many years to come. The place belongs to old Lord Gunthorpe, I fancy, but really I hardly know. I do know that we should give it up at once if we gave up the hounds, and that we can't be turned out {{as long as we have}} them. Doesn't it seem odd to have to depend on a lot of yelping dogs?" ...|$|E
60|$|Three {{weeks later}} Philip saw Mildred {{and her baby}} off to Brighton. She had made a quick {{recovery}} and looked better {{than he had ever}} seen her. She was going to a boarding-house where she had spent a couple of weekends with Emil Miller, and had written to say that her husband was obliged to go to Germany on business and she was coming down with her baby. She got pleasure out of the stories she invented, and she showed a certain fertility of invention in the working out of the details. Mildred proposed to find in Brighton some woman who would be willing to take charge of the baby. Philip was startled at the callousness with which she insisted on getting rid of it so soon, but she argued with common sense that the poor child had much better be put somewhere before it grew used to her. Philip had expected the maternal instinct to make itself felt when she had <b>had</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> two or three weeks and had counted on this to help him persuade her to keep it; but nothing of the sort occurred. Mildred was not unkind to her baby; she did all that was necessary; it amused her sometimes, and she talked about it a good deal; but at heart she was indifferent to it. She could not look upon it as part of herself. She fancied it resembled its father already. She was continually wondering how she would manage when it grew older; and she was exasperated with herself for being such a fool as to have it at all.|$|E

5000|$|A {{frequent}} {{question posed}} by midwives is how [...] "many times <b>has</b> <b>the</b> <b>baby</b> kicked in <b>the</b> last twelve hours?"

"Charlotte," [...] said Miss Rosetta firmly, [...] "the most {{sensible}} {{thing for}} you to do is just to come back with <b>the</b> <b>baby.</b> You are worried to death trying to run this farm with the debt Jacob Wheeler left on it for you.
