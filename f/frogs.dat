5|$|Some <b>frogs,</b> such as {{the poison}} dart <b>frogs,</b> are {{especially}} toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these <b>frogs</b> to apply to their weapons for hunting, although few species are toxic enough {{to be used for}} this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart poison <b>frogs</b> for self-protection. Some <b>frogs</b> obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, {{such as the}} Australian corroboree <b>frogs</b> (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of <b>frogs</b> have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the <b>frogs,</b> may be severely affected.|$|E
5|$|Amphibians, where {{regionally}} accessible, {{have been}} found in the river otter's diet during the spring and summer months, as indicated in many of the food habit studies. The most common amphibians recognized were <b>frogs</b> (Rana and Hyla). Specific species of reptiles and amphibians prey include: boreal chorus <b>frogs</b> (Pseudacris maculata); Canadian toads (Bufo hemiophrys); wood <b>frogs</b> (Rana sylvatica); bullfrogs (Rana catesbeiana); green <b>frogs</b> (Rana clamitans); northwestern salamanders (Ambystoma gracile); Pacific giant salamander (Dicamptodon ensatus); rough-skinned newt (Taricha granulosa); and garter snakes (Thamnophis).|$|E
5|$|Camouflage is {{a common}} {{defensive}} mechanism in <b>frogs.</b> Most camouflaged <b>frogs</b> are nocturnal; during the day, they seek out {{a position where they}} can blend into the background and remain undetected. Some <b>frogs</b> have the , but this is usually restricted to a small range of colours. For example, White's tree frog (Litoria caerulea) varies between pale green and dull brown according to the temperature, and the Pacific tree frog (Pseudacris regilla) has green and brown morphs, plain or spotted, and changes colour depending on the time of year and general background colour. Features such as warts and skin folds are usually on ground-dwelling <b>frogs,</b> for whom smooth skin would not provide such effective camouflage. Certain <b>frogs</b> change colour between night and day, as light and moisture stimulate the pigment cells and cause them to expand or contract.|$|E

5|$|Ground-dwelling <b>frogs</b> {{generally}} {{lack the}} adaptations of aquatic and arboreal <b>frogs.</b> Most have smaller toe pads, if any, and little webbing. Some burrowing <b>frogs</b> such as Couch's spadefoot (Scaphiopus couchii) have a flap-like toe extension on the hind feet, a keratinised tubercle {{often referred to}} as a spade, that helps them to burrow.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{longevity}} of <b>frogs</b> and toads in the wild, but some can live for many years. Skeletochronology is a method of examining bones to determine age. Using this method, the ages of mountain yellow-legged <b>frogs</b> (Rana muscosa) were studied, the phalanges of the toes showing seasonal lines where growth slows in winter. The oldest <b>frogs</b> had ten bands, so their age was believed to be 14 years, including the four-year tadpole stage. Captive <b>frogs</b> and toads have been recorded as living for up to 40 years, an age achieved by a European common toad (Bufo bufo). The cane toad (Bufo marinus) has been known to survive 24 years in captivity, and the American bullfrog (Rana catesbeiana) 14 years. <b>Frogs</b> from temperate climates hibernate during the winter, and four species are known to be able to withstand freezing during this time, including the wood frog (Rana sylvatica).|$|E

5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart <b>frogs</b> are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart <b>frogs</b> in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other poison <b>frogs</b> lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. Poison <b>frogs</b> fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. Poison <b>frogs</b> can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most <b>frogs</b> copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
5|$|Poison dart <b>frogs</b> are {{endemic to}} humid, {{tropical}} environments of Central and South America. These <b>frogs</b> are generally found in tropical rainforests, including in Bolivia, Costa Rica, Brazil, Colombia, Ecuador, Venezuela, Suriname, French Guiana, Peru, Panama, Guyana, Nicaragua, and Hawaii (introduced).|$|E
5|$|At the {{breeding}} site, the male mounts the female and grips her tightly round the body. Typically, amplexus {{takes place in}} the water, the female releases her eggs and the male covers them with sperm; fertilization is external. In many species such as the Great Plains toad (Bufo cognatus), the male restrains the eggs with his back feet, holding them in place for about three minutes. Members of the West African genus Nimbaphrynoides are unique among <b>frogs</b> in that they are viviparous; Limnonectes larvaepartus, Eleutherodactylus jasperi and members of the Tanzanian genus Nectophrynoides are the only <b>frogs</b> known to be ovoviviparous. In these species, fertilization is internal and females give birth to fully developed juvenile <b>frogs,</b> except L. larvaepartus, which give birth to tadpoles.|$|E

5|$|Coloured {{gold and}} green, the <b>frogs</b> are {{voracious}} eaters of insects, {{but will also}} eat larger prey, such as worms and mice. Unlike most <b>frogs,</b> they are active at day, although this is mostly to warm in the sun. They {{tend to be less}} active in winter except in warmer or wetter periods, and breed in the warmer months. Males reach maturity after around 9 months, while for the larger females, this does not occur until they are two years old. The <b>frogs</b> can engage in cannibalism, and males frequently attack and injure one another if they infringe on one another's space.|$|E

5|$|<b>Frogs</b> and toads are broadly {{classified}} into three suborders: Archaeobatrachia, which includes four families of primitive frogs; Mesobatrachia, which includes five families of more evolutionary intermediate frogs; and Neobatrachia, {{by far the}} largest group, which contains the remaining 24 families of modern <b>frogs,</b> including most common species throughout the world. The Neobatrachia suborder is further divided into the two superfamilies Hyloidea and Ranoidea. This classification is based on such morphological features as the number of vertebrae, the structure of the pectoral girdle, and the morphology of tadpoles. While this classification is largely accepted, relationships among families of <b>frogs</b> are still debated.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frogs</b> live on all {{the continents}} except Antarctica, {{but they are not}} present on certain islands, {{especially}} those far away from continental land masses. Many species are isolated in restricted ranges by changes of climate or inhospitable territory, such as stretches of sea, mountain ridges, deserts, forest clearance, road construction, or other man-made barriers. Usually, a greater diversity of <b>frogs</b> occurs in tropical areas than in temperate regions, such as Europe. Some <b>frogs</b> inhabit arid areas, such as deserts, and rely on specific adaptations to survive. Members of the Australian genus Cyclorana bury themselves underground where they create a water-impervious cocoon in which to aestivate during dry periods. Once it rains, they emerge, find a temporary pool, and breed. Egg and tadpole development is very fast in comparison to those of most other <b>frogs,</b> so breeding can be completed before the pond dries up. Some frog species are adapted to a cold environment. The wood frog (Rana sylvatica), whose habitat extends into the Arctic Circle, buries itself in the ground during winter. Although much of its body freezes during this time, it maintains a high concentration of glucose in its vital organs, which protects them from damage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Frogs</b> such as Physalaemus nattereri, Physalaemus deimaticus, and Pleurodema brachyops have {{a warning}} display behaviour. These animals inflate {{themselves}} with air {{and raise their}} hind parts to appear as large as possible, and display brightly coloured markings and eyespots to intimidate predators. Seven species of <b>frogs</b> in the genus Pleurodema have lumbar glands (making the animals distasteful, so in their case the display is likely aposematic); these glands are usually boldly contrasted in black as a further warning.|$|E

5|$|<b>Frogs</b> {{typically}} {{lay their}} eggs in water. The eggs hatch into aquatic larvae called tadpoles that have tails and internal gills. They have highly specialized rasping mouth parts suitable for herbivorous, omnivorous or planktivorous diets. The life cycle is completed when they metamorphose into adults. A few species deposit eggs on land or bypass the tadpole stage. Adult <b>frogs</b> generally have a carnivorous diet consisting of small invertebrates, but omnivorous species exist and a few feed on fruit. <b>Frogs</b> are extremely efficient at converting what they eat into body mass. They are an important food source for predators {{and part of the}} food web dynamics of many of the world's ecosystems. The skin is semi-permeable, making them susceptible to dehydration, so they either live in moist places or have special adaptations to deal with dry habitats. <b>Frogs</b> produce a wide range of vocalizations, particularly in their breeding season, and exhibit many different kinds of complex behaviours to attract mates, to fend off predators and to generally survive.|$|E
5|$|Local style sculptures are {{generally}} boulders carved into zoomorphic shapes, including three-dimensional representations of <b>frogs,</b> toads and crocodilians.|$|E
5|$|Many <b>frogs</b> {{are able}} to absorb water and oxygen {{directly}} through the skin, especially around the pelvic area, but the permeability of a frog's skin can also result in water loss. Glands located all over the body exude mucus which helps keep the skin moist and reduces evaporation. Some glands on the hands and chest of males are specialized to produce sticky secretions to aid in amplexus. Similar glands in tree <b>frogs</b> produce a glue-like substance on the adhesive discs of the feet. Some arboreal <b>frogs</b> reduce water loss by having a waterproof layer of skin, and several South American species coat their skin with a waxy secretion. Others <b>frogs</b> have adopted behaviours to conserve water, including becoming nocturnal and resting in a water-conserving position. Some <b>frogs</b> may also rest in large groups with each frog pressed against its neighbours. This reduces the amount of skin exposed to the air or a dry surface, and thus reduces water loss. Woodhouse's toad (Bufo woodhousii), if given access to water after confinement in a dry location, sits in the shallows to rehydrate. The male hairy frog (Trichobatrachus robustus) has dermal papillae projecting from its lower back and thighs, giving it a bristly appearance. They contain blood vessels and are thought to increase {{the area of the}} skin available for respiration.|$|E
