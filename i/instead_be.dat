5|$|As {{well as the}} {{evolution}} of new metabolic pathways, evolution can also cause the loss of metabolic functions. For example, in some parasites metabolic processes that are not essential for survival are lost and preformed amino acids, nucleotides and carbohydrates may <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> scavenged from the host. Similar reduced metabolic capabilities are seen in endosymbiotic organisms.|$|E
5|$|Development of {{the film}} started in the early 1980s with Tom Mankiewicz {{assigned}} to write the script. The screenplay would <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> crafted by Jim Cash and Jack Epps Jr., both of Top Gun fame. The project also went through directors Steven Spielberg, John Landis, Walter Hill, and Richard Benjamin {{before the arrival of}} Beatty. Filming was mostly at Universal Studios. Danny Elfman was hired to compose the film score, and the music was featured on three separate soundtrack albums.|$|E

5|$|Disney, as {{the rights}} holder, had {{plans for a}} sequel to Monsters, Inc. since 2005. Following {{disagreements}} with Pixar, Disney tasked its Circle 7 Animation unit to make the film. An early draft of the film was developed; however, Disney's purchase of Pixar in early 2006 led to the cancellation of Circle 7's version of the film. A Pixar-made sequel was confirmed in 2010, and in 2011, {{it was confirmed that}} the film would <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> a prequel titled Monsters University.|$|E
5|$|During the {{airing of}} The Making of Frozen: Return to Arendelle on ABC, it was {{announced}} that a holiday special titled Olaf's Frozen Adventure is currently under production and slated for release in winter 2017.

5|$|However, it {{was decided}} that the Common Assembly, which became the Parliament, should <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> based in Strasbourg—the Council of Europe (CoE) was already based there, in the House of Europe. The chamber of the CoE's Parliamentary Assembly could also serve the Common Assembly, and they did so until 1999, when a new complex of {{buildings}} was built across the river from the Palace.|$|E

5|$|Romney {{supported}} the Bush administration's Troubled Asset Relief Program {{in response to}} the late-2000s financial crisis, later saying that it prevented the U.S. financial system from collapsing. During the U.S. automotive industry crisis of 2008–10, he opposed a bailout of the industry in the form of direct government intervention, and argued that a managed bankruptcy of struggling automobile companies should <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> accompanied by federal guarantees for post-bankruptcy financing from the private sector.|$|E
5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and formaldehyde detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere.

5|$|The courts {{recognise}} {{two forms}} of secret trust. Fully secret trusts are trusts not referred to {{at all on the}} face of the will. Instead, an agreement made between the testator and trustees elsewhere. The trustee will <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> named only a beneficiary. In the case of a half-secret trust, the fact that the beneficiary holds as trustee only is declared {{on the face of the}} will, but not the other terms of the trust.|$|E
5|$|The party {{believes}} that artists {{should be less}} dependent on public support, and <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> more dependent on making a living on what they create. The party {{believes that}} regular people should rather decide what good culture is, and demands that artists on public support should offer something the audience wants. It also wants to abolish the annual fee for the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation and privatise the company. Otherwise, the party wants to protect and secure Norwegian cultural heritage.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{evidence}} either for or against the hypothesis that Menkauhor's successor Djedkare Isesi was his son. Two sons have been suggested for Menkauhor based on the dating and general location of their tombs in Saqqara: princes Raemka and Kaemtjenent, both believed to be children of Meresankh IV. By the same reasoning, they could <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> sons of Djedkare Isesi.|$|E

50|$|Some {{gastropod}} shells {{have very}} high spires (the shell {{is much higher}} than wide), some have low spires (the shell is much wider than high), and there are all possible grades between. In a few gastropod families the shells are not helical in their coiling, but <b>instead</b> <b>are</b> planispiral, flat-coiled. In these shells, the spire does not have a raised point, but <b>instead</b> <b>is</b> sunken.|$|R

5|$|Astatine has an {{electronegativity}} of 2.2 on {{the revised}} Pauling scale– {{lower than that}} of iodine (2.66) and the same as hydrogen. In hydrogen astatide (HAt) the negative charge is predicted to be on the hydrogen atom, implying that this compound should <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> referred to as astatine hydride. That would be consistent with the electronegativity of astatine on the Allred–Rochow scale (1.9) being less than that of hydrogen (2.2). The electron affinity of astatine is predicted to be reduced by one-third because of spin–orbit interactions.|$|E
5|$|By late 1962 a {{decision}} {{on whether or not}} to deploy Zeus was looming. Bell began considering a replacement for the Zeus missile that would operate at much shorter ranges, and in October, sent out study contracts to three contractors to be returned in February. Even before these were returned, in January 1963 McNamara announced that the construction funds allocated for Zeus would not be released, and the funding would <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> used for development of a new system using the latest technologies. The name Nike-X was apparently an ad hoc suggestion by Jack Ruina, the director of ARPA, who was tasked with presenting the options to the President's Science Advisory Committee (PSAC). With the ending of Zeus, the ZMAR radar effort was renamed MAR, and plans for an even more powerful version, MAR-II, became {{the central part of the}} Nike-X concept.|$|E
5|$|Construction of the WindSeekers at Canada's Wonderland, Cedar Point, and Kings Island {{began in}} late October and early November 2010. To install them, Canada's Wonderland's Jet Scream ride was removed and Cedar Point's Ocean Motion {{was moved to}} the former Demon Drop site. Construction was {{scheduled}} to begin around the same time at Knott's Berry Farm, where the Sky Cabin observation tower was to be removed to make way for it. On January 7, 2011, however, it was announced that their WindSeeker would not replace Sky Cabin but <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> located in the Fiesta Village section of the park. Work began almost immediately after this announcement.|$|E

5|$|Dermaptera is {{relatively}} small {{compared to the other}} orders of Insecta, with only about 2,000 species, 3 suborders and 15 families, including the extinct suborders Archidermaptera and Eodermaptera with their extinct families Protodiplatyidae, Dermapteridae, Semenoviolidae, and Turanodermatidae. The phylogeny of the Dermaptera is still debated. The extant Dermaptera appear to be monophyletic and there is support for the monophyly of the families Forficulidae, Chelisochidae, Labiduridae and Anisolabididae, however evidence has supported the conclusion that the former suborder Forficulina was paraphyletic through the exclusion of Hemimerina and Arixeniina which should <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> nested within the Forficulina. Thus, these former suborders were eliminated in the most recent higher classification.|$|E
5|$|Diefenbaker {{attended}} {{a meeting of}} the Commonwealth Prime Ministers in London shortly after taking office in 1957. He generated headlines by proposing that 15% of Canadian spending on US imports <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> spent on imports from the United Kingdom. Britain responded with an offer of a free trade agreement, which was rejected by the Canadians. As the Harold Macmillan government in the UK sought to enter the Common Market, Diefenbaker feared that Canadian exports to the UK would be threatened. He also believed that the mother country should place the Commonwealth first, and sought to discourage Britain's entry. The British were annoyed at Canadian interference. Britain's initial attempt to enter the Common Market was vetoed by French President Charles de Gaulle.|$|E
5|$|Full focus shifted onto The Missing Link when {{development}} {{ended on}} Human Revolution, {{with the main}} game's staff bringing their experience to bear upon the DLC when building its environments. The story was designed {{so that it would}} not spoil the events of the main narrative, but <b>instead</b> <b>be</b> a self-contained experience that would provide more context to the setting. The game's title referred to both its status as filling a narrative gap, and an in-game plot element. The DLC was developed as a stand-alone experience, accessible through the main menu independent of the player's place within the main game. This was due to technical problems related to the improvement work at transitioning {{from one to the other}} at its chronological point: the higher detail and polish would have made the experience jarring for players.|$|E
