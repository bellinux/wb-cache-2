50|$|In 1910 {{the only}} {{significant}} changes {{were made to the}} instrument with the replacement of Schulze’s “borrowed” solo manual with an independent department in its own swell box. Another new swell-box was provided for the <b>echo</b> <b>organ</b> making it in the words of Magnus Black “inaudible above the traffic except {{in the early hours of}} the morning”. The echo swell box shutters have since been removed! A large leathered No1 Diapason, standing in its own separate chest, was added to the Great at this time. It was removed in 1959.|$|E
50|$|The Cathedral {{has a large}} organ {{that was}} {{originally}} built by Geo. Kilgen and Son, Inc. in 1915. Originally, the organ had two four manual (keyboard) organ consoles, one in the gallery with the organ, and another console behind the sanctuary. In 1946, Kilgen put a new organ into the Cathedral. The 1946 organ had 77 ranks of pipes, 14 of which came from the older organ. In 1948, an <b>Echo</b> <b>Organ</b> from Carnegie Hall, New York City was installed in the Cathedral. In 1984, the M. P. Moller organ company refurbished the organ.|$|E

50|$|In 1924, John D. Spreckels {{commissioned}} the Ernest M. Skinner Company of Boston {{to build the}} symphonic organ. The museum organ, which is housed inside the museum above the main galleries, has 4 manuals and pedals, 7 divisions, 63 ranks, {{with a total of}} 4,526 pipes. Symphonic music is especially effective on the museum organ with its battery of pneumatically operated percussion instruments and set of tubular chimes. A thunder pedal is used for the musical representation of storms.

50|$|Among the {{compositions}} of Caprioli {{mention the}} Sonatas artificial, small but varied work that includes songs undoubtedly {{influenced by the}} beautiful works of Vecchi, motets for solo voice and as a duo in a popular language concerted, duets and chamber sonatas for an instrument high, one low and basso continuo and Sacrae Cantiones, where the motets for solo voice, with effects of <b>echo</b> <b>organ,</b> the vocal part is made florid and expressive through rapid sprints virtuosic. But {{some of the best}} compositions are in the duets of the same volume, where, at times, a painful lack of melodic invention is compensated by the excellent triple counterpoint between the voices and the constant in a declamatory style that anticipates the duets of Monteverdi on the same text.|$|E
50|$|The {{park was}} built with Spanish Colonial architecture, {{and has a}} number of {{noticeable}} features. The prominent Spanish Renaissance-style Cathedral Tower was designed by the Bryan family and the architect Clarence L. Jay, and has been a landmark since its construction in 1924-1925. There are elaborately designed doorways and arches, large Spanish windows in art glass, imported marbles, and tiling. Long Beach resident Julious Fisher created the intricate stencils and woodcarvings tracing the walls of the mausoleum. The marble was done by Lohr Marble Company in Pasadena, and restored by them in 1978. This was the first mausoleum to be equipped with Deagan tower chimes and pipe organ, and the only one with an <b>echo</b> <b>organ</b> in conjunction with its regular pipe organ.|$|E
50|$|For {{six weeks}} in January and February 1994, {{scaffolding}} filled the Gallery to provide access for wood craftsmen to begin the arduous process of cleaning, repairing, and oiling the hand-carved organ facade. Meanwhile, the Peragallo Pipe Organ Company of Paterson, New Jersey had been awarded the contract to clean and restore all of the pipework {{as well as the}} chests and wind systems. Their first task was to remove all the facade pipes for cleaning and refinishing. It was decided to return the pipework to its original zinc finish, only adding a protective coating to avoid oxidation in the future. After completing work on the facade, Peragallo moved to the interior of the instrument for the purpose of restoring the Great, Choir, Swell, Solo, String and Pedal divisions. The entire Chancel Organ was restored in 1995. Finally, the <b>Echo</b> <b>Organ,</b> situated in the triforium near the center crossing, underwent tonal modifications, making it more useful as the Nave Organ. The organ work was finished in 1997.|$|E

50|$|By 1927, it was {{announced}} that the Kilgen firm of St. Louis, Missouri had been selected to build the chancel, gallery and <b>echo</b> (triforium) <b>organs,</b> with Courboin as tonal designer. The resulting instrument was then and remains now the magnum opus of the Kilgen firm and one of the finest organs in the world.|$|R

5000|$|As {{part of the}} Fox West Coast circuit, the Balboa {{featured}} live vaudeville and movies, {{accompanied by}} orchestra and organ. An article from the American Theatre Organ Society states that Edward Swan was the organist at the Balboa Theatre in 1925-26 and he claims that the original 426 pipe [...] Robert Morton organ was the finest he had ever played. It had an <b>echo</b> <b>organ</b> over the balcony. He “played the features while the small orchestra did the vaudeville segments. Sometimes Ed also played the organ or piano with the orchestra and his playing time lengthened to 10 or 12 hours a day.” In 1930 the theatre was upgraded for sound pictures and a new neon marquee was added. In 1934, it was remodeled, reopening as Teatro Balboa, featuring Spanish-language films. The theater’s office space was converted to housing for the U.S. Navy during World War II. After the war, Balboa languished as a movie house and in 1959 was purchased by the Russo family. Because of its rich history and splendid architecture the Balboa was designated as a local historic site in 1972. Although the 1973 Horton Plaza Redevelopment Plan called for complete restoration of the building as a theatre, the City of San Diego instead condemned it; the Centre City Development Corporation (CCDC) made plans to gut the theatre for commercial space, intending to strip the interior and build four floors of retail space.|$|E

40|$|To {{measure the}} beam {{parameters}} of intravascular ultrasound imaging transducers with operating center frequencies exceeding 20 MHz and beamwidths below 200 m, a hydrophone with a spot diameter less than 50 m and a bandwidth greater than 150 MHz is required. The hydrophone {{described in this}} article is a step towards meeting these requirements. Diagnostic ultrasound imaging is used routinely in a growing number of medical applications. Hewlett-Packard manufactures a range of ultrasound imaging systems that use digital beamformers for cardiology and multipurpose imaging and mechanical beamformers for cardiology, general-purpose, and intravascular imaging. At the heart of an ultrasound system is a transducer, an electroacoustic device that converts electrical signals into a focused mechanical wave and reconverts reflected mechanical <b>echoes</b> from <b>organs</b> and tissue for subsequent real-time image construction. The transducer is a resonant device that has a bandpass filter frequency response. Currently available transducers have a center frequency in the range of 2 to 30 MHz. A phased array of individual transducers, typically consisting of 30 to 300 elements, is electronically focused and steered to provide a beam with the dimensions desired for a selected medical application. Current trends in imaging are to the following higher-frequency applications: Intravascular imaging for plaque detection in blood vessels such as the coronary arteries Contrast-agent-assisted harmonic frequency imaging to view blood flow and perfusion in the hear...|$|R

It was not such as he had dreamt, and, like a German as he was, he added that he could not think, he could only feel, that there was something ineffable in it; yet he was almost disappointed to find his visions unfulfilled, and the hues of the painted glass less pure and translucent than those of the ice crystals on the mountains. However after his eye had become trained, the deep influence of its dim solemn majesty, and of the <b>echoes</b> of its <b>organ</b> tones, and chants of high praise or earnest prayer, began to enchain his spirit; and, if ever he were missing, he was sure to be found among the mysteries of the cathedral aisles, generally with Ebbo, who felt the spell of the same grave fascination, since whatever was true of the one brother was generally true of the other. They were essentially alike, though some phases of character and taste were more developed in the one or the other.|$|R
