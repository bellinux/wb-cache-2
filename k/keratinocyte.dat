25|$|Papillomaviruses {{replicate}} {{exclusively in}} keratinocytes. Keratinocytes form the outermost {{layers of the}} skin, {{as well as some}} mucosal surfaces, such as the inside of the cheek or the walls of the vagina. These surface tissues, which are known as stratified squamous epithelia, are composed of stacked layers of flattened cells. The cell layers are formed through a process known as cellular differentiation, in which keratinocytes gradually become specialized, eventually forming a hard, crosslinked surface that prevents moisture loss and acts as a barrier against pathogens. Less-differentiated <b>keratinocyte</b> stem cells, replenished on the surface layer, are thought to be the initial target of productive papillomavirus infections. Subsequent steps in the viral life cycle are strictly dependent on the process of <b>keratinocyte</b> differentiation. As a result, papillomaviruses can only replicate in body surface tissues.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Neoplastic canine <b>keratinocytes</b> {{derived from}} a {{spontaneous}} oral squamous cell carcinoma were maintained in culture for more than 45 passages. The presence of desmosomes and keratin filaments was demonstrated by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry. The <b>keratinocytes</b> were grown in two different culture conditions to induce variations in the stage of differentiation, i. e., in submerged cultures and at the air-liquid interface. For comparison, normal canine <b>keratinocytes</b> were grown under the same conditions. Aniso-cytosis was present in neoplastic cultures grown submerged in medium. Grown at the air-liquid interface, neoplastic <b>keratinocytes</b> differentiated into a well-organized, multilayered stratified squamous epithelium anal-ogous to normal <b>keratinocytes.</b> Rare areas of irregular growth and formation of whorls were detected. Expression of lectin binding sites and specific cell surface antigens of neoplastic and normal <b>keratinocytes</b> demonstrated marked similarities between the two cell lines. Neoplastic cells lacked certain surface antigens that are present on normal cells. Squamous cell carcinoma cells grew faster than normal canine <b>keratinocytes</b> as demonstrated by growth curve evaluation. Neoplastic <b>keratinocytes</b> responded to growth stimulation by epidermal growth factor and cholera toxin as do normal <b>keratinocytes.</b> Neoplastic cells grown in medium lacking these factors proliferated faster than growth factor stimulated normal <b>keratinocytes.</b> Key words: Differentiation; dog; lectins; lifted culture; monoclonal antibodies; neoplastic <b>keratinocytes...</b>|$|R

40|$|To {{determine}} if <b>keratinocytes</b> influence melanocyte number and {{position in the}} developing epidermis we have experimentally recombined <b>keratinocytes</b> and melanocytes from epidermis of different stages of differentiation in the skin equivalent (SE) system. Previously we showed that developmental differences in the position and number of melanocytes characteristic of the epidermis in vivo were preserved in fetal and neonatal skin equivalents. In the present study we have combined cultured fetal or neonatal <b>keratinocytes</b> with age-matched or non-age-matched cultured melanocytes on the dermal equivalent. The ratio of basal <b>keratinocytes</b> to melanocytes (BK/M) present in multiple high-power fields was determined after localization of melanocytes by staining with the melanocyte-specific monoclonal antibody, HMB- 45. The BK/M ratio in SE composed of neonatal <b>keratinocytes</b> and either fetal (n = 4) or neonatal (n = 5) melanocytes was 26. 2 and 21. 5, respectively. The BK/M ratio in SE composed of fetal <b>keratinocytes</b> and either fetal (n = 8) or neonatal (n = 5) melanocytes was 9. 2 and 7. 7, respectively. In each case, the BK/M ratio was dependent on the <b>keratinocytes</b> rather than the melanocytes. With either type of melanocyte, ratios in SE composed of neonatal <b>keratinocytes</b> were significantly greater than those with fetal <b>keratinocytes.</b> These results establish that <b>keratinocytes</b> regulate the BK/M ratio in this model and suggest that developmental differences between fetal and neonatal <b>keratinocytes</b> {{may be responsible for}} determining melanocyte numbers in the epidermal-melanin unit in vivo. The precise mechanisms that control the organization and number of melanocytes in the epidermis are unknown although <b>keratinocytes</b> may interact with melanocytes via growth factors, cell surface molecules, or other factors related to proliferation and differentiation of the epidermis...|$|R
25|$|IL-17 {{interaction}} with IL-17RA receptors, abundant on the <b>keratinocyte</b> cell surface, incite epidermal cells to increase expression of IL-6, antimicrobial peptides, IL-8 and CCL20. Increased concentration of IL-6 alters the epidermal environment by decreasing {{the ability of}} T regulatory cells to control the behavior of Th17 cells. Reduced regulation allows uninhibited proliferation of Th17 cells and production of IL-17 in psoriatic lesions, augmenting IL-17 signaling. Antimicrobial peptides and IL-8 attract neutrophils {{to the site of}} injury where these cells remove damaged and inflamed <b>keratinocyte</b> cells. New immature DCs are also recruited by CCL20 via chemotaxis where their activation restarts and amplifies the cycle of inflammation. IL-17 and additional cytokines released from the influx of neutrophils, T and dendritic cells mediate effects on localized leukocytes and keratinocytes that supports the progression of psoriasis by inciting chronic inflammation.|$|E
25|$|The {{fact that}} the {{papillomavirus}} life cycle strictly requires <b>keratinocyte</b> differentiation has posed a substantial barrier {{to the study of}} papillomaviruses in the laboratory, since it has precluded the use of conventional cell lines to grow the viruses. Because infectious BPV-1 virions can be extracted from the large warts the virus induces on cattle, it has been a workhorse model papillomavirus type for many years. CRPV, rabbit oral papillomavirus (ROPV) and canine oral papillomavirus (COPV) have also been used extensively for laboratory studies.|$|E
25|$|Papillomaviruses {{gain access}} to <b>keratinocyte</b> stem cells through small wounds, known as microtraumas, in the skin or mucosal surface. Interactions between L1 and sulfated sugars on the cell surface promote initial {{attachment}} of the virus. The virus is then able to get inside from the cell surface via interaction with a specific receptor, likely via the alpha-6 beta-4 integrin, and transported to membrane-enclosed vesicles called endosomes. The capsid protein L2 disrupts the membrane of the endosome, allowing the viral genome to escape and traffic, along with L2, to the cell nucleus.|$|E

Normal skin architecture is dependent {{both on the}} coordinated proliferation and stratification of <b>keratinocytes,</b> {{as well as the}} maintenance of a collagen-rich basement membrane. In the present studies we sought to determine whether expression of H-ras in skin <b>keratinocytes</b> would affect these parameters during the establishment and maintenance of an in vitro skin equivalent. Previously described cdk 4 and hTERT immortalized foreskin <b>keratinocytes</b> were engineered to express ectopically introduced H-ras. Skin equivalents, composed of normal fibroblast-contracted collagen gels overlaid with <b>keratinocytes</b> (immortal or immortal expressing H-ras), were prepared and incubated for 3 weeks. Harvested tissues were processed and sectioned for histology and antibody staining. Antigens specific to differentiation (involucrin, keratin- 14, p 63), basement-membrane formation (collagen IV, laminin- 5), and epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT; e-cadherin, vimentin) were studied. Results showed that H-ras <b>keratinocytes</b> produced an invasive, disorganized epithelium most apparent in the lower strata while immortalized <b>keratinocytes</b> fully stratified without invasive properties. The superficial strata retained morphologically normal characteristics.
