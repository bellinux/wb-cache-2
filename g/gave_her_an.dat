5|$|Her hip-hop fluency <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{advantage}} in the pop-star arms race, helping her to become the presiding voice in an increasingly rap-dominated musical landscape. Her evolution, from rap-adjacent R star (appearing as early as 1998 in a Geto Boys video) to reluctant hip-hop shareholder to full-blown rapper, {{played a role in}} slowly shifting the sound of pop radio.|$|E
5|$|Schmidt had {{secretly}} been sending money to British banks with fleeing refugees {{ever since the}} Nazis took power in Germany in January 1933. When she eventually tried {{to leave the country}} on 28 June 1939, Sicherheitsdienst (SD) agents arrested her at the Dutch border and took her to Gestapo headquarters. Once there she was seen by Walter Schellenberg, who at that time worked in the counter-intelligence department of the SD. He <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum: cooperate with the Nazis or be sent to a concentration camp.|$|E
5|$|In 1933, deHavilland {{made her}} debut in amateur theatre in Alice in Wonderland, a {{production}} of the Saratoga Community Players {{based on the novel}} by Lewis Carroll. She also appeared in several school plays, including The Merchant of Venice and Hansel and Gretel. Her passion for drama eventually led to a confrontation with her stepfather, who forbade her from participating in further extracurricular activities. When he learned that she had won the lead role of Elizabeth Bennet in a school fund-raising production of Jane Austen's Pride and Prejudice, he <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum to either stay home or not return home. Not wanting to let her school and classmates down, she left home forever, moving in with a family friend.|$|E

2500|$|The {{passengers}} {{who had been}} saved took up a collection for Kate. The [...] "little girls" [...] of Dubuque <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> medal, {{and the state of}} Iowa <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> another one, crafted by Tiffany & Co., and $200. The Chicago and North Western Railway <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> $100, <b>a</b> half barrel of flour, half a load of coal, and a lifetime pass. The Order of Railway Conductors <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>a</b> gold watch and chain.|$|R
5|$|In 1965, while {{a student}} at Bennington College, Dworkin was arrested during an anti-Vietnam War protest at the United States Mission to the United Nations {{and sent to the}} New York Women's House of Detention. Dworkin testified that the doctors in the House of Detention <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{internal}} examination which was so rough that she bled for days afterwards. She spoke in public and testified before a grand jury about her experience, and the media coverage of her testimony made national and international news. The grand jury declined to make an indictment in the case, but Dworkin's testimony contributed to public outrage over the mistreatment of inmates. The prison was closed seven years later.|$|E
5|$|When the British largely {{abandoned}} Carleton Island in 1783, Brant {{moved to}} Cataraqui, now Kingston, Ontario. There the British government built her {{a house and}} <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> annual pension of £100. She was assigned Farm Lot A in Kingston Township, along the northern limit of the town. It was 116 acres, instead of the standard 200 acres, because it was encroached upon by the Clergy Reserve. In addition, Brant and her family received compensation from the British government for their losses in the American Revolution. Hoping {{to make use of}} her influence, the United States offered Brant compensation if she would return with her family to the Mohawk Valley, but she refused.|$|E
5|$|S Club 7 {{first came}} to public {{attention}} in 1999, when they starred in their own television series, Miami 7. The show first aired on CBBC on BBC One and was a children's sitcom based {{on the lives of}} the group who had moved to Miami, Florida in search of fame in America. The show was also launched in the United States, airing on Fox Family, and later on ABC Family; it was retitled S Club 7 in Miami for American audiences. The show eventually celebrated worldwide success and was watched by 90 million viewers in over 100 different countries. The group also filmed two specials between the first two series of their show. The first, Back to the '50s—which aired on CITV, instead of CBBC—told the story of how the group found themselves back in 1959. In the second TV special, Boyfriends & Birthdays, Stevens' boyfriend <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> ultimatum of staying with him or remaining with S Club.|$|E

5|$|The {{two main}} {{characters}} are Miranda, and the laughing man (Marcus). Stead began writing When You Reach Me in 2007 after reading {{an article in}} The New York Times <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> idea for a novel about traveling in time to save someone's life. The article was {{about a man who}} woke up in Denver suffering from amnesia, having forgotten who he was or why he was there. Many people worked with the man to help him regain his memory. Under hypnosis, he spoke about his apparent wife, Penny, and two daughters who died in a car crash. However, when he and Penny reunited, the man found out she was only his fiancée— and they had no children. Upon reading this, Stead wondered if somehow the man had returned to the past to prevent an accident but lost his memory along the way. In addition, the article reminded Stead of a strange old man, called the 'laughing man', who lived near her house as a child.|$|E
25|$|On 24 May 1774, {{two weeks}} after the death of Louis XV, her husband <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> estate, the Petit Trianon, and free rein to {{renovate}} it; soon rumours circulated that she plastered the walls with gold and diamonds.|$|E
25|$|A theory {{which was}} first propounded by Edward Marshall Hall was that Crippen was using hyoscine {{on his wife}} as a {{depressant}} or anaphrodisiac, but accidentally <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> overdose and then panicked when she died. It is said that Hall declined to lead Crippen's defense because another theory was to be propounded.|$|E

25|$|Patti's {{career was}} one of success after success. She sang not only in England and the United States, but also as far afield in {{mainland}} Europe as Russia, and in South America as well, inspiring audience frenzy and critical superlatives wherever she went. Her girlish good looks <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> appealing stage presence, which added to her celebrity status.|$|E
25|$|Combined {{with her}} sultry eyes and husky voice, Bennett's new brunette look <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> earthier, more arresting persona. She won praise for her {{performances}} as Brenda Bentley in the crime/drama The House Across the Bay (1940), also featuring George Raft, and as Carol Hoffman in the anti-Nazi drama The Man I Married, a film in which Francis Lederer also starred.|$|E
25|$|That Anthony had {{remained}} unmarried <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> important business advantage in this work. A married woman {{at that time}} had {{the legal status of}} feme covert, which, among other things, excluded her from signing contracts (her husband could do that for her, if he chose). As Anthony had no husband, she was a feme sole and could freely sign contracts for convention halls, printed materials, etc.|$|E

25|$|The Guardian {{reported}} {{that according to}} a series of media reports in October 2010, Berlusconi had met El Mahroug, then 17, through Nicole Minetti. Mahroug insisted that she had not slept with the then 74-year-old prime minister. She told Italian newspapers that she merely attended dinner at his mansion near Milan. El Mahroug said she sat next to Berlusconi, who later took her upstairs and <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> envelope containing €7,000. She said he also gave her jewellery.|$|E
25|$|My {{father was}} very slow {{to get into}} the cornfield. He was so indignant at the ruffians that he was unwilling to retreat before them. My little {{children}} were in the field three hours. They seemed to know that if they cried the noise would betray their parents whereabouts, and so they kept as still as mice. The baby was very hungry & I <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> ear of raw green corn which she ate ravenously.|$|E
25|$|To pay the dowry of the Princess Royal, the British Parliament allotted {{the sum of}} 40,000 {{pounds and}} also <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> appanage of 8,000 pounds per year. Meanwhile, in Berlin, King Frederick William IV {{provided}} an annual allowance of 9,000 thalers to his nephew Frederick. The income of {{the heir to the}} Prussian throne proved insufficient to cover a budget consistent with his position and that of his future wife. Throughout much of their marriage, Victoria relied on her own resources.|$|E

25|$|Enright won an {{international}} scholarship to Lester B.

She received an English and philosophy degree from Trinity College, Dublin. She began writing in earnest when her family <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> electric typewriter for her 21st birthday.

25|$|Singapore's port <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> {{advantage}} over her neighbouring countries, being a favourable spot for efficient exports of refined goods and imports of raw material. This meant that industries in Singapore found international markets easily, and cheaper prices for raw goods. Singapore's growing industrialisation meant that entrepot trade had been extended into processing of imported raw materials into exported finished products — leading to higher value-added goods which brought more income to the island. This {{ended up being}} a suitable alternative to a common market to the Malaysian hinterland, although later a form of it ended up being formed {{with the creation of}} ASEAN.|$|E
25|$|She was a {{precocious}} child, — {{so much so}} that, {{on being}} asked, she once confessed she had no more recollection of learning to read either French or English than of learning to talk. As soon as she could walk, her mother said, she was following her about, book in hand, begging to be taught to read stories for herself. She read them soon to so much purpose that before she was five years old, she had finished the Bible, being rewarded by a polyglot Testament for the feat, and had also read Plutarch, which at every subsequent reading <b>gave</b> <b>her</b> <b>an</b> equal pleasure, and at seven, had mastered Racine in the original, upon which she began the study of Latin with her father.|$|E
