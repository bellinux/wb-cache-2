Section 9 of that act authorized the production of various coins, including [...] "DOLLARS OR UNITS—each to be of the value of a Spanish milled dollar as the same is now current, and to contain three hundred and seventy-one grains and four sixteenth parts of a grain of pure, or four hundred and sixteen grains of standard silver".

Some eight thousand (being late conquest) was liquid and actually tractile in the bank; the rest whirled beyond reach and even sight (save in the mirror of a balance-sheet) under the compelling spell of wizard Pinkerton. Dollars of mine were tacking off the shores of Mexico, in peril of the deep and the guardacostas; they rang on saloon counters {{in the city of}} Tombstone, Arizona; they shone in faro-tents among the mountain diggings: the imagination flagged in following them, so wide were they diffused, so briskly they span to the turning of the wizard's crank. But here, there, or everywhere I could still tell myself it was all mine, and--what was more convincing--draw substantial dividends. My fortune, I called it; and it represented, when <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars</b> or even British pounds, an honest pot of money; when extended into francs, a veritable fortune.

A single-period partial equilibrium model is used to show that the executive income can be expressed {{as a function of the}} firm's return <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollar</b> terms. The executive income is jointly determined by the opening firm size and current return, which function as a managerial talent proxy and self-selection mechanism respectively. Comparing to Jensen and Murphy (1990) wealth-based Pay-Performance Sensitivity (PPS), this research presents an income-based PPS. The alternative PPS not only overcomes a misleading misspecification in Jensen and Murphy (1990), but also corrects Rosen's (1992) argument for only including return in the pay performance relationship. This research finds empirically that both the opening firm size and stock return play a significant role in determining executive income. This study provides supplementary evidence to Murphy's (1986) Learning Model. However, shareholder income may not be an ideal performance measure in capturing the multi-period pay-performance relationship...|$|R

40|$|The {{authors would}} like to thank the three {{anonymous}} reviewers for their helpful comments. INCOMMENSURATE RESOURCES: NOT JUST MORE OF THE SAME The pricing literature is replete with research focusing on how consumers respond to sales promotions when both the reference level and the change are <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollar</b> terms (i. e., discounts). The “psychophysics of pricing ” suggests changes in monetary magnitude are not based on their absolute level, but rather on their deviation from some reference level, or how the change is “framed. ” Accordingly, a $ 5 reduction appears more significant on a $ 15 purchase than a $ 125 purchase (Tversky and Kahneman 1981). Often times, however, a promotion is presented in non-monetary terms (e. g., a premium). When two resources are delivered simultaneously, but in different currencies (e. g., receive a free razor with the purchase of a can of shaving cream) the marginal value of the non-monetary, incremental benefit may be difficult to evaluate in relation to the focal product or its price. The value of the premium, therefore, may be less likel...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{indiscriminate}} {{use of antibiotics}} increases the appearance of bacterial resistance and forces the use of more expensive alternatives. The Chilean Ministry of Health is regulating the consumption of antibiotics since September 1999. These regulatory measures restricted the sale of antibiotics only when these were prescribed by an MD or an DS. Aim: To study {{the impact of these}} regulatory measures on antibiotics sales in pharmacies. Material and methods: A retrospective analysis of antibiotics sales in pharmacies from 1996 to 2000. The information was obtained from the International Marketing System (IMS Health), an auditing system of pharmacy sales. The consumption unit used was the Defined Daily Dose per 1000 inhabitants/day (DDD). Results: There was an important reduction in DDD, after the introduction of regulatory measures, for amoxicillin, ampicillin, erythromycin, trimethoprim/sulpha, chroramphenicol, cloxacillin and phenoxymethylpenicillin. There was also a important fall in sales, <b>expressed</b> <b>in</b> <b>dollars.</b> Conclusions: The regulatory measures of the Ministry of Health, had an immediate and great impact on antibiotics sales in Chile (Rev Méd Chile 2002; 130 : 1265 - 72) ...|$|E

Examples of such outcomes include getting pregnant, contracting a sexually transmitted disease (STD) or experiencing side effects. By conducting a face-to-face survey, I have assembled a unique dataset on women’s subjective expectations regarding existing birth control methods. While respondents have, on average, expectations consistent with actual population outcomes, they exhibit substantial heterogeneity in their subjective beliefs, which emphasizes the need to rely on expectations data when conducting inference. I combine expectations data with observed choices to estimate a random utility model of birth control choice, without making any assumption about expectations. Effectiveness, protection against STDs and partner’s disapproval {{are found to be}} the most important factors in the decision process.
