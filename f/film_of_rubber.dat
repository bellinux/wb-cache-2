40|$|Two {{striking}} features {{revealed in}} a photograph (cf Figure 1) of a thin <b>film</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> binder highly filled with glass beads are: a) that the growth of voids around particles increases with increasing strain and b) that the preferred direction of the void growth {{seems to be in}} the direction of the applied macroscopic strain. It is obvious that the local stress field around particles in a deformed composite is not as high as it would be if the binder did not pull away from the filler particles. On the other hand, because of the high rigidity of the particles relative to the binder, the local stress field in the binder will still be significantly higher than the average macroscopic stress field. It is of interest to define both this stress field and the associated dilatation in terms of a simple model...|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} a number of {{investigations}} have shown that the diffusion of vapours through high polymers does not conform to Fick's law. This thesis presents data on the diffusion of benzene vapour through <b>films</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> and <b>of</b> polythene together with a discussion of the deviations from Fick's law. Rates of diffusion and permeation have been measured over a wide range of temperature and pressure. Prom the temperature variation the energies of diffusion and permeation have been calculated. The variation of these rates with pressure has been related to experimentally determined activities and it is shown that the deviations from Fick's law are due to: (1) Non-linear dependence of activity upon concentration. (2) Variation of mobility of the benzene in the polymer with concentration. By making use of a suitably modified form of Pick's law these two factors have been measured, and they have each been examined in the light of approximate theories. <p...|$|R
40|$|The <b>films</b> <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> {{hydrochloride}} (RH) and polyvinylidenchloride (PC) are commercially {{used for}} casing of fish sausage. But {{it has been}} recognized that the fish sausage cased with RH film is preserved longer in a good condition than that cased with PC film, and that PC film is not suitable for this purpose, especially in summer. The results of studies on the cause of difference in preservation period between the fish sausages cased with these two films are presented. At first, the aerial permeability test <b>of</b> the <b>film</b> {{was carried out by}} using resazurin. The result was that PC film was less permeable than RH film, so that there was no correlation between the aerial permeability <b>of</b> the <b>films</b> and the preservation period. It is known, moreover, that chlorine ion is liberated from RH film when heated, but the author 2 ̆ 7 s examination proved that it has no influence on the bacterial growth. In connection with this fact, it was confirmed that some substance liberated by heating from RH film inhibited the growth of bacteria. It is concerned with some of the compounding ingredients <b>of</b> <b>rubber.</b> It seems that the substance is liberated from RH film during heating process in the case of manufacturing fish sausage, and that it plays a part in inhibiting the growth of bacteria in the superficial portion of fish sausage. 塩酸ゴム(Rubber hydrochloride,以下RHと略記),ポリビニリデソクロライド(Polyvinylidenchloride,以下PCと略記) などのフィルムが魚肉ソーセージのケーシングとして主に使用されているが,PCフィルムで包装した方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも腐敗しやすいと一般に言われており,ことに夏季においてはPCフィルムは使用されていないようである. 貯蔵期間にこのような差の生ずる原因については報告を見ない. 著者は魚肉ソーセージの腐敗菌は嫌気性菌の場合もあるが,主として好気性菌であると報告されていることから考えて,両フィルムの通気性についてレサズリンを用いて検べたところ,RHフィルムがPCフィルムに較べて相当大きかつた. しかし,製造後の貯蔵期間はPCフィルムを用いた方がRHフィルムを用いた場合よりも逆に短かいことから推察すると空気の透過性とは無関係のようである. 一方著者はRHフィルムを加熱すると塩素イオンが遊離することから両フィルムの物理的性質よりも,むしろ化学的性質の差に基づくものであろうと考えて実験を行ない,加熱によつてRHフィルムからは微生物の増殖を阻害する物質が遊離されることを知り,その物質がRHの製造過程中に加えられる配合成分と関係のあることを確めた...|$|R

The <b>films</b> <b>of</b> pure <b>rubbers</b> and the blends with the tackifier were prepared by a solution-cast method using toluene as a solvent. Two sheets composed <b>of</b> different <b>rubbers,</b> in which the tackifier was mixed at least in one rubber sheet, were piled together and annealed beyond the glass transition temperature Tg of the tackifier. The transfer phenomenon of the tackifier between the sheets was evaluated by the peak shift in the tensile loss modulus E" curve, ascribed to Tg <b>of</b> the <b>rubbers,</b> which was measured by the dynamic mechanical analysis. Moreover, crystallization temperature of BR was also employed as a measure of the transfer, because the tackifier retards the crystallization of BR. It is found that the tackifier moves from one rubber to another during annealing procedure to reduce severe localization. When the content is the same in each rubber, the tackifier immigrates from BR to SBR, suggesting a better miscibility with SBR. This behavior is attributed to the small difference in the solubility parameter between SBR and the tackifier as compared to that between BR and the tackifier...|$|R

Through stretching and compressing rubber specimens, obtain the stress-strain relationship <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> material. Build finite element model <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generator, get the maximum static deformation and static stiffness in different forms of constitutive models and take actual tests <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generator. Compare finite element results with the actual test results, select Arruda-Boyce model as rubber hyperelastic model. This study lay a good foundation for the design <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> waveform generators and study of dynamic characteristics of impact test devices...|$|R

In {{order to}} {{investigate}} mechanics performance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete steel composite beam, nonlinear analysis on four steel concrete composite beams with different amount <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> {{has been carried}} out using finite element analysis software, and the influence <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete to mechanical properties of composite beam was explored. The results show that ductility, crack resistance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> concrete slab, shear capacity of shear connector for rubber concrete steel composite beam are improved significantly compared with ordinary steel concrete composite beams. Along with the increase <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> content, the energy consumption of composite beams gradually increases, while the ultimate bearing capacity decreases with small amplitude. As a kind of green environmental protection material Rubber Aggregate concrete has the characteristics of good ductility, crack resistance is strong, energy consumption is obvious and good wear resistance...|$|R

The friction coefficients needs to be around or below 0.005 for ice skating to be possible. The reason ice skating is possible is because there is a thin <b>film</b> <b>of</b> water present between the blade of the ice skate and the ice. The origin <b>of</b> this water <b>film</b> has been a long-standing debate.There are three proposed mechanisms that could account for a <b>film</b> <b>of</b> liquid water on the ice surface: ...|$|R
40|$|The {{rubber plant}} {{is the second}} {{commodity}} after palm plants {{in the village of}} Sedinginan and Banjar XII, but there are problems with low productivity because a lot <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant been old and damaged thereby inhibiting the development of community forest based on rubber plant. The sampling method using the simple random sample. The collection of data used were primary and secondary data. The results of the research aspects of socio-cultural and economic impact on farmers in developing community forestbased on rubber plant, assessed from the age of farmers belonging to a productive and has experience in planting and maintenance <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant. The low productivity <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant, makes the net income of farmer is not enough for every day. The farmer factor do not conduct replanting,because some <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> crop still young and no farmer budget do not conduct replanting. Strategies SWOT Analysis can be taken is to use superior seeds qualified and revive the tradition <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plant. In order for the production <b>of</b> <b>rubber</b> plants is better role of the Department of Forestry and required Plantation...|$|R
