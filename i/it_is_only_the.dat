Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> 8th most populous town in the region, it has the third largest cultural heritage after Strasbourg and Colmar. Sélestat has 35 listed buildings and 119 additional sites that are indexed in the French list of cultural heritage monuments.|$|E
5|$|Sang Penari {{touches on}} the history of {{communism}} in Indonesia, focusing on the nation's communist party spreading its ideology and the government's purge of the Communist Party's members from 1965–1966, which is thought to have killed several hundred thousand. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> third Indonesian film to cover the killings, following Arifin C. Noer's G30S/PKI (1984) and Riri Riza's Gie (2005). Tohari later said that if he had written about the killings as they were depicted in the film, the repressive New Order government would have had him shot.|$|E
5|$|Arizona {{has been}} {{affected}} by hurricanes on numerous occasions. Usually, these storms originate in the eastern Pacific Ocean, make landfall in the Mexican states of Baja California or Sonora, and dissipate before crossing into the United States. Thus, in most cases, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> tropical cyclones' remnant moisture that produces heavy rainfall—and in some occasions, flooding—in portions of Arizona. However, approximately every five years, a tropical cyclone retains sufficient strength to enter {{the state as a}} tropical storm or a tropical depression. Arizonans can expect indirect flash floods caused by the remnants of tropical cyclones to occur about every two years.|$|E

5|$|The {{first chapter}} asks what {{religion}} is, stating that religious thought is contradictory, {{is rooted in}} intuition, and that God is fundamentally a mystery. The second and third chapters look at the negative divine - the characterisation of God as void, silence or non-being - which Stace maintains is an idea found in all religions. He maintains that mystical experience is shared by all mankind, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> theories about it that differ. On this point {{he says he is}} in agreement with Otto. In this experience the distinction between subject and object is overcome, indeed there is no difference between the experiencer and the experience.|$|E

25|$|Most Anglican cathedrals in Canada are modest parish {{churches and}} <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> cathedrals of Toronto, (St. George's Cathedral), Montreal, Kingston, Halifax, St. John's, and Victoria which have {{significant}} dimensions or imposing designs, though even they are modest by European or even Australian standards.

25|$|Studies {{show that}} there is a genetic proclivity for dizygotic twinning. However, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> mother who has any effect on the chances of having such twins; there is no known {{mechanism}} for a father to cause the release of more than one ovum. Dizygotic twinning ranges from six per thousand births in Japan (similar to the rate of monozygotic twins) to 14 and more per thousand in some African countries.|$|E
25|$|Unlike Western royal families, the Saudi Monarchy {{has not had}} {{a clearly}} defined order of succession. Historically, upon {{becoming}} King, the monarch has designated an heir apparent to the throne who serves as Crown Prince of the Kingdom. Upon the King's death the Crown Prince becomes King, and during the King's incapacitation the Crown Prince, likewise, assumes power as regent. Though other members of the Al Saud hold political positions in the Saudi government, technically <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> King and Crown Prince who legally constitute the political institutions.|$|E

Our generation was breaking the Iron Curtain. It was a generation crippled by history, and most of our dreams were doomed to be unfulfilled – but the fight for freedom was not in vain.|$|E
25|$|A-League {{football}} {{has been}} played in 27 stadiums since the inaugural {{season of the}} A-League in 2005. Hindmarsh Stadium, the home of Adelaide United, is currently the only soccer-specific stadium used in the A-League. Adelaide Oval, secondary home of Adelaide United, has the greatest seating capacity (53,583) of any stadium used by an A-League club (excluding Melbourne's Docklands Stadium), although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> fourth largest stadium in Australia by capacity, and is an oval stadium, being designed for cricket and Australian rules football.|$|E
25|$|Plasmodium vivax is a protozoal {{parasite}} and a human pathogen. The {{most frequent}} and widely distributed cause of recurring (Benign tertian) malaria, P. vivax {{is one of}} the five species of malaria parasites that commonly infect humans. It is less virulent than Plasmodium falciparum, the deadliest of the five, but vivax malaria can lead to severe disease and death due to splenomegaly (a pathologically enlarged spleen). P. vivax is carried by the female Anopheles mosquito, since <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> female of the species that bites.|$|E

25|$|In 1922, Schott pioneered {{a further}} advance called {{electro-oculography}} (EOG), {{a method of}} recording the electrical potential between the cornea and the retina. Electrodes may be covered with special contact paste before being placed on the skin. So, it is now unnecessary to make incisions in patient's skin. Common misconception about EOG is that measured potential is the electromyogram of extraocular muscles. In fact, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> projection of eye dipole to the skin, because higher frequencies, corresponding to EMG, are filtered out. EOG delivered considerable improvements in accuracy and reliability, which explain its continued use by experimentalists for many decades.|$|E
25|$|Bermuda did not—despite having OCT {{status as}} defined by the Rome Treaty—join the EU-OCT Association (OCTA) {{together}} with the other overseas territories in November 2001, but instead only joined OCTA on 2 July 2014. As of July 2014, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> three remote areas without any permanent population (British Antarctic Territory, British Indian Ocean Territory and South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands), that are not members of OCTA. All citizens of the British overseas territories, except those residing at Britain's sovereign bases in Cyprus, were granted full British citizenship by the British Overseas Territories Act 2002, and are consequently citizens of the European Union.|$|E
25|$|The dunes {{developed}} from the 'glacial lakes' that formed between the Valparaiso Moraine and the receding glacier. As such, there are no Glacial Kames in the dunes area. (see Geology of the Indiana Dunes) With the lack of glacial kames to locate burials, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>only</b> <b>the</b> projectile points that are usable for rough dating. Simultaneous with the Glacial Kame people, the Red Ocher people and the Old Copper Culture. Like the Glacial Kame culture, these other groups are identified by their burial goods. The centers of the Red Ocher and Old Copper Culture are further from the Indiana Dunes and no artifacts {{have been identified as}} being from any of these three cultural groups.|$|E
