2500|$|Continuing the play-within-a-play structure, the Illusionist {{presents}} the remaining {{events of the}} day in scenes which the astonished participants themselves watch from behind the pillar. [...] The Chamberlain just has time to prepare Ondine for her reception with the king. Ondine is particularly advised not to mention the wart on the king's nose. [...] Ondine tactlessly mentions that the Chamberlain's hand is damp and constantly interrupts him to talk to Bertram with whom she immediately establishes a rapport. [...] At the king's reception Ondine cannot take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Bertha. [...] She accuses Bertha of trying to steal Hans from her. [...] The King says, “Bertha only wants to be your friend.” [...] Ondine replies, “You are entirely mistaken! [...] Bertha is a hypocrite. [...] She flatters you constantly. [...] Has she ever dared to speak to you about...the wart on your nose?” [...] In panic, the Chamberlain clears the room. [...] Ondine is alone with the king. [...] The king asks, “Who are you, Ondine?” [...] Ondine explains everything and says that she weeps because “they are trying to take Hans away from me.” [...] But what if they did, the king asks. [...] “would that be such a misfortune?” [...] Ondine answers, “Oh yes. [...] If he deceives me, he will die.” [...] The king says, “Men have been known to survive such things.” [...] “Not this one,” Ondine replies.|$|E
60|$|The {{little black}} {{skeleton}} began to chew the dry meal with evident satisfaction, but without taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her deliverer.|$|E
6000|$|... [TIBBY, never taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> MRS. BRADMERE, or {{the pipe}} [...] from her mouth, has backed stolidly to the door, and vanished.] ...|$|E
5000|$|For a time it {{appeared}} that a lucky Tipperary goal three minutes before half-time seemed to have established the destiny of the final. Claire Grogan's speculative lob bounced in front of All Star goalkeeper Aoife Murray who took <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> it momentarily to allow it through her legs, a huge set-back after Cork had battled back from a four-point deficit to trail by just a point.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{heard the}} door open," [...] Nanny answered, without taking <b>her</b> greedy <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the ring. [...] "Was it him? Whaur did you get this, lassie?" ...|$|R
60|$|Again {{he aimed}} and slowly grew rigid. Helen {{could not take}} <b>her</b> fascinated <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> him. He knelt, bareheaded, and in the shadow she {{could make out the}} gleam of his {{clear-cut}} profile, stern and cold.|$|R
60|$|She {{crossed her}} {{hands in front of}} her and bowed her head solemnly, without uttering a word, and without taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> mine for a moment.|$|E
60|$|If Nanny had {{not taken}} <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> Gavin for the moment she {{would have known that}} he was now anxious to change the topic. Babbie saw it, and became suspicious.|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't, Wilfrid," [...] said Mrs. Flushing, neither moving nor taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> {{the spot}} on the floor upon which they rested. [...] "What's the use of talking? What's the use--?" [...] She ceased.|$|E
5000|$|Later on, Jeannie is {{in panic}} and crying, telling an animal control officer {{that she was}} babysitting, took <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the baby for [...] "one teensy minute" [...] and the baby was gone. Tired Tom and Jerry arrive with the baby. Jeannie grabs the baby while the two try to escape, but the animal control officer (voiced by Bill Thompson) arrests Tom and Jerry, {{assuming}} they were [...] "baby nappers". In the police car, the police officer cannot believe Tom and Jerry's explanation. Just then, to their surprise, the baby crawls past in the police car and away into the distance.|$|R
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> being <b>off</b> me, I felt I {{could allow}} myself to leave the room. Its {{atmosphere}} had become hopeless for little Fyne's domestic peace. You may smile. But to the solemn all things are solemn. I had enough sagacity to understand that.|$|R
60|$|Then he had sat down, and Margaret {{received}} her cup {{in the usual}} way. The girls and children stared at each other, and the governess, who always breakfasted at the house, did not dare to lift <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> from <b>off</b> <b>her</b> plate.|$|R
60|$|Van Helsing {{called in}} one of the women, and told her to stay with her and not to take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her till we returned, and then beckoned me out of the room.|$|E
6000|$|Taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her newspaper, and pausing with a {{suspended}} expression of countenance, {{as if she}} must finish the paragraph in hand before undertaking any other business whatever, Miss Abbey demanded, with some slight asperity: 'Now then, what's for you?' ...|$|E
60|$|She {{tried to}} return to her reading, but for the life of her she could not keep <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the silent, painted woman who stared and stared and stared in cold, {{threatening}} silence upon this ancient enemy of her house.|$|E
60|$|The dark {{young lady}} {{had never taken}} <b>her</b> dark <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> him, but seemed to be {{studying}} him with almost tragic exactitude. At {{the end of her}} scrutiny she had something like the shadow of a smile, and she sat down in a chair.|$|R
6000|$|The baby {{laughed and}} crowed. The old mother {{could not take}} <b>her</b> dim <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the face of her son, but sat smiling {{at him as he}} ate and rattled on. When he rose from the table at last, after eating heartily and praising it all, he said with a smile: ...|$|R
6000|$|The admiral helped himself liberally {{from the}} dish; sent Magdalen to the side-table {{to get him}} some bread; and, when he thought <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> was <b>off</b> him, furtively tumbled the whole {{contents}} of his plate into Brutus's mouth. Cassius whined faintly as his fortunate comrade swallowed the savory mess at a gulp. [...] "Hush! you fool," [...] whispered the admiral. [...] "Your turn next!" ...|$|R
60|$|Il Duca's {{hand was}} wrapped in a bandage, but the damaged finger {{did not seem to}} affect him seriously. Beth could not take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> this dreadful {{evidence}} of her late conflict, and stared at it as if the bandage fascinated her.|$|E
6000|$|... "If {{you don't}} know, it isn't often you're so dull. She's up to {{something}} and Meg Keith sees it; she keeps a close watch on the woman and when she's forced to take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her sets Miss Graham on guard." ...|$|E
60|$|Sam did not {{at first}} observe {{that the child was}} {{trembling}} very much and gazing eagerly at the old man. He had to repeat the question twice before she understood him, and then she asked the girl, without taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the old man.|$|E
50|$|One of {{the most}} {{promising}} applications of eye tracking research is in the field of automotive design. Research is currently underway to integrate eye tracking cameras into automobiles. The goal of this endeavor is to provide the vehicle with the capacity to assess in real-time the visual behavior of the driver. The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that drowsiness is the primary causal factor in 100,000 police-reported accidents per year. Another NHTSA study suggests that 80% of collisions occur within three seconds of a distraction. By equipping automobiles with the ability to monitor drowsiness, inattention, and cognitive engagement driving safety could be dramatically enhanced. Lexus claims to have equipped its LS 460 with the first driver monitor system in 2006, providing a warning if the driver takes his or <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the road.|$|R
5000|$|Gillian G. Gaar of the Seattle Pop Culture Examiner, wrote [...] "The {{first half}} hour of this {{documentary}} feels like an infomercial about former National Security Advisor/Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. But then her true colors are revealed; this is one determined woman who never took <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the ball, switching political parties as needed (it will probably surprise some to learn that Rice has been a democrat) {{in the interest of}} advancing her career. But the question of what she may have lost in the process {{lies at the heart of}} Doggart's searing film, most tellingly when the issue of what is or isn't torture is discussed (a part that will make more sensitive viewers squeamish). The larger question — is it worth sacrificing principles in the pursuit of power? — is left for the viewer to decide." ...|$|R
6000|$|I hesitated about {{accepting}} his proposal. While I was in doubt, Mrs. Sherwin {{took the}} opportunity, when <b>her</b> husband's <b>eye</b> was <b>off</b> <b>her,</b> of nodding {{her head at}} me significantly. She evidently wished me to join Margaret at the party--but why? What did her behaviour mean? ...|$|R
6000|$|She has lifted <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her manuscript; she {{is looking}} out with {{kindling}} countenance over the gardens of the Museum; her ripe curling Greek lips, such as we never see now, even among her own wives and sisters, open. She is talking to herself. Listen! ...|$|E
60|$|Poor Kate! she {{had gone}} through the {{ceremony}} almost mechanically-- recklessly, we might be justified in saying; for not having raised <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the floor from its commencement to its close, the man whom she accepted {{for better or for worse}} might have been Jacques or Redfeather for all that she knew.|$|E
6000|$|Taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the book, to test {{her memory}} of {{something}} in it, Lizzie {{was the first}} to see herself observed. As she rose, Miss Wren likewise became conscious, and said, irreverently addressing the great chief of the premises: 'Whoever you are, I can't get up, because my back's bad and my legs are queer.' ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{were all}} rather excited over the magic lantern show which an {{itinerant}} lecturer {{was to give}} in the schoolhouse that evening. Even Felix and I, who had seen such shows galore, were interested, and the rest were quite wild. There had never been such a thing in Carlisle before. We were all going, Peter included. Peter went everywhere with us now. He was a regular attendant at church and Sunday School, where his behaviour was as irreproachable {{as if he had}} been [...] "raised" [...] in the caste of Vere de Vere. It was feather in the Story Girl's cap, for she took all the credit of having started Peter on the right road. Felicity was resigned, although the fatal patch on Peter's best trousers was still an eyesore to her. She declared she never got any good of the singing, because Peter stood up then and every one could see the patch. Mrs. James Clark, whose pew was behind ours, never took <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> it--or so Felicity averred.|$|R
60|$|It chanced that Elvira {{was so much}} tired by all {{the little}} excitements of the night, that for once she laid aside her company manners, which were both easy and correct, and in the most natural manner in the world leaned her head on Leon's shoulder. At the same time, fatigue {{suggesting}} tenderness, she locked the fingers of her right hand into those of her husband's left; and, half closing <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> dozed <b>off</b> into a golden borderland between sleep and waking. But all {{the time she was}} not aware of what was passing, and saw the painter's wife studying her with looks between contempt and envy.|$|R
25|$|Shwetha is now distraught {{with being}} in the limelight and understands what Nikhil had tried to tell her. Nikhil, the actor, meets Shwetha and tells her that he cannot decide if the present moment is a dream or reality but he is {{ultimately}} happy. Asking Shwetha to close <b>her</b> <b>eyes,</b> Nikhil jumps <b>off</b> the roof to the confusion of everyone present, including the contract killer waiting to kill him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Are you a coward?" [...] {{she asked}} quietly, without taking <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the soldier. Then {{she said in}} Zulu, [...] "Listen. The land {{on this side of}} the Tugela has been given by Dingaan to the English. Here he has no right to kill. This girl is mine, not his. Come one step nearer and you die." ...|$|E
60|$|Gradually {{the fire}} of the Indians ceased, and the {{defenders}} were able to leave the loop-holes. Two of the men went down and fastened up the cattle, which were still standing loose in the yard inside the stockade; the other set to to prepare a meal, for Mrs. Welch could not take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> the canoe.|$|E
60|$|Nor had he, though even {{to me he}} told nothing, till we were {{together}} in the dark one evening, much later. He did insist upon seeing Emily; but her mother would not leave her, or take <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>off</b> her, and the timid thing did nothing but sob and cry, in utter helplessness and shame, and never even gave him a look.|$|E
60|$|I {{went back}} to the rectory. It was close on the hour which I had {{appointed}} with Lucilla--now that the responsibility rested on my shoulders--for allowing her to use <b>her</b> <b>eyes.</b> On taking <b>off</b> the bandage, I noticed a circumstance which confirmed the conclusion at which I had already arrived. <b>Her</b> <b>eyes</b> deliberately avoided looking into mine. Suppressing as well as I could the pain which this new discovery caused me, I repeated Grosse's words, prohibiting her from attempting to look into a book, or to use a pen, until he had seen her again.|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to {{investigate}} an important problem and approaches of human eye detection, blinking, and tracking. A new system was proposed and implemented using android technology for smartphones. System creatively reduces accidents due to drivers’ fatigue by focusing on treating the driver after fatigue has been detected to achieve decrease in accident likelihood. Smartphone's have been the important tools in our society for the abundant functions including communication, entertainment and online office etc. as the pivotal devices of mobile computing. Smartphone development has also become more important than before. Android is one of the emerging leading operating systems for smartphones as an open source system platform. Many smartphones have adopted this platform and more smartphones will do so in the future. The proposed system is well-suited for real world driving conditions since it can be non-intrusive by using video cameras to detect changes. Driver operation and vehicle behavior can be implemented by equipping automobiles with the ability to monitoring the response of the driver. This involves periodically requesting the driver to send a response to the system to indicate alertness. The propose system based on eyes closer count & yawning count of the driver. By monitoring the eyes and face, it is believed that the symptoms of driver fatigue can be detected early enough to avoid a car accident and providing the driver with a warning if the driver takes his or <b>her</b> <b>eye</b> <b>off</b> the road...|$|R
50|$|There is also early Irish {{literature}} about female pissing contests. In the story Aided Derbforgaill several women compete {{to see who}} can urinate deepest into a pile of snow. The winner is Derbforgaill, wife of Lugaid Riab nDerg, but the other women attack her out of jealousy and mutilate her by gouging out <b>her</b> <b>eyes</b> and cutting <b>off</b> <b>her</b> nose, ears, and hair, resulting in her death. Her husband Lugaid also dies, from grief, and Cú Chulainn avenges the deaths by demolishing a house with the women inside, killing 150.|$|R
