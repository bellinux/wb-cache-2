500|$|The film also {{influenced}} American film productions: John Carpenter {{has suggested that}} the film inspired the idea of a featureless mask for the Michael Myers character in the slasher film series Halloween. Carpenter recalls that the film crew [...] "didn't have any money to make a mask. It was originally written the way you see it, in other words, it's a pale mask with human features, almost featureless. I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> wrote that down, why Debra [...] and I decided on that, maybe it was because of an old movie called Eyes Without a Face".|$|E

500|$|Savage {{introduced}} himself to certain {{writers in the}} North Beach area of San Francisco in the 1970s. He befriended and traveled with Beat poets Allen Ginsberg and Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Stephen Schwartz Savage maintained a correspondence with Ginsberg consisting of ten letters and a trio of postcards across four years, which is maintained with Ginsberg's papers at Stanford University. One letter asked for Ginsberg and Ferlinghetti to come do a poetry reading, so others could [...] "hear and see and <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> adore your public image." [...] Another acquaintance was poet and author Neeli Cherkovski, who says that Savage dreamed of becoming a stand-up comic in the mold of Lenny Bruce.|$|E
500|$|During the film's fire scene, Cody {{appears as}} a {{character}} in the barroom. [...] "To me, I am afraid of fire and fire technics {{and all that stuff}} which is why I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> asked to be in the bar scene because I've never exploded before", she said. She had asked to be set on fire. [...] "That was me trying to conquer a fear. By the way, they would not allow me to do a full burn for insurance purposes, even though I argued that Burt Reynolds had done it once", stated Cody. [...] "But apparently he got really hurt, so they would not let me. To me, there's nothing more horrifying than being stuck in a claustrophobic space as it is burning down so, to me, it was more like tapping into a personal fear. That's not tough." ...|$|E
500|$|Doby {{experienced}} many prejudices {{during his}} time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of {{his days as a}} barrier-breaker. [...] "You <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name.

500|$|Critical {{opinion of}} the soundtrack was mixed. Some reviewers, such as Ben Schweitzer of RPGFan, {{found it to be}} of medium quality, saying it [...] "suffer from {{occasional}} compositional problems" [...] and noted that others refer to it as simply [...] "in the middle" [...] of the soundtracks of Final Fantasy IV and Final Fantasy VI, though he stated [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> love Final Fantasy V's music" [...] despite this. Schweitzer praised the [...] "Main Theme of Final Fantasy V" [...] ("Ahead on Our Way") as [...] "a truly stirring piece of music" [...] and [...] "triumphant, hopeful, and yet almost longing at the same time," [...] but stated that [...] "Uematsu's compositional style hits a sort of early plateau here." [...] Other reviewers disagreed, with Jason Strohmaier of Soundtrack Central finding it to be an underrated album, while Jeremy Althouse of Soundtrack Central felt that it was on par with Uematsu's other works.|$|E
500|$|A President Aaron Bay-Schuck at Interscope Records asked songwriters and {{producers}} J.R. Rotem, Justin Tranter and Julia Michaels {{to work with}} Stefani on the album. Stefani recalled saying the following to them during a recording session: [...] "'Listen, I don’t care about anything. I don’t care about hits. I don’t care about anything except for coming in this room right now…all I {{want to do is}} just say the truth. I just want the truth to come out'." [...] Michaels, revealed that [...] "Gwen had written down of all of these things she was feeling at that moment. There was this one phrase that read, 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> cry but I think it's because I remembered {{for the first time since}} I hated you that I used to love you.' I said, 'Whoa, what a crazy line that is.' She just goes, 'Cool, make it a melody. Let's go." [...] The song was written after Stefani was told by her label that the album was too personal to release; she rebelled against their advice and continued writing personal songs. The next day she ended up writing what she thought was the least commercial song on the album, [...] "Used to Love You", and they approved it.|$|E
500|$|Since its release, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] has {{received}} critical acclaim from contemporary music critics. Madison Vain of Entertainment Weekly felt the song's [...] "hyper-personal lyrics" [...] were [...] "immediate and affecting". Immediately following its release, Maeve McDermott from USA Today awarded the track [...] "Song of the Week" [...] in October, further adding that [...] "he song's spiritual sibling {{is another of}} Stefani's best works: 1996's No Doubt classic 'Don't Speak'," [...] but noting that [...] "this time around, coming from a more mature artist with fewer things to prove, the pain feels dizzyingly fresh." [...] Bianca Gracie of Idolator praised {{the fact that the}} singer was [...] "stepping away from the pumped-up vibes of previous tracks like 'Spark The Fire' & 'Baby Don’t Lie', also noting that [...] "eartache is immediately relatable (just ask Adele) and Gwen is often praised for her underrated slow songs , so it is refreshing to witness her jumpstart this current album era with a new vibe." [...] Alex Kritselis of Bustle called it [...] "a fantastic 'comeback single' — a tremendous improvement over 'Baby Don't Lie'," [...] praising that [...] "when she repeatedly sings, 'I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> used to love you,' during the climax, you feel it." [...] Music Times Carolyn Menyes agreed, noting that [...] "we haven't heard a breakup anthem from this girl since her Tragic Kingdom days. After a series of less-than-stellar singles, it's safe to say Stefani is back." [...] In a later review of the parent album, Menyes stated she was [...] "impressed with the vulnerability [...] displayed", comparing it to Stefani's previous singles [...] "Cool" [...] and [...] "Ex-Girlfriend". Menyes concluded by saying the potential on This Is What the Truth Feels Like is evident on tracks like [...] "Used to Love You".|$|E

500|$|... "Used to Love You" [...] {{was written}} by Stefani, Justin Tranter, Julia Michaels and J.R. Rotem; Rotem {{is also one of}} the song's producers. [...] The song is a {{vulnerable}} and [...] "emotional" [...] midtempo synthpop ballad, having a [...] "driving piano melody", with a length of three minutes and forty-seven seconds. Spins James Grebey wrote that the song [...] "largely showcases her passionate, conflicted vocals over restrained, electropop-leaning swells of emotional synths and drum taps." [...] Lyrically, [...] "Used to Love You" [...] is a break-up anthem, where Stefani is questioning how she fell in love with her ex in the first place. The majority of music critics noted that the song is inspired by Stefani's divorce from Gavin Rossdale, after a 13-year marriage. In an interview for Todays Matt Lauer, Stefani confirmed that the track was inspired by the end of her marriage, claiming: [...] "I’ve never put a record out where I’m actually going through things in real time. his is like, I wrote that song like a couple weeks ago." [...] According to Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone that could be seen in the lines of the chorus, [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>why</b> <b>I</b> cry / But I think it's cause I remember for the first time / Since I hated you / That I used to love you." [...] In other poignant lyrics, she sings, [...] "I guess nobody taught you, nobody taught you how to love." [...] Kreps further compared the lyrical content of [...] "Used to Love You" [...] to [...] "Dreaming the Same Dream", a song from No Doubt's sixth album Push and Shove. Alex Kritselis of Bustle claimed that the song [...] "recalls some of [...] best ballads, like 'Cool', 'Early Winter', and '4 in the Morning'." ...|$|E
