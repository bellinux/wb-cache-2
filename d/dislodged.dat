5|$|As Leighton was {{unlikely}} to be <b>dislodged,</b> Ferguson promised to find Gunn another club, and fulfilled his pledge when he sold him for £100,000 to Norwich City in October 1986. The transfer nearly went through {{in the summer of}} 1986, but Ferguson delayed the move until October to allow time for Leighton to recover from an injury.|$|E
5|$|The flood <b>dislodged</b> {{thousands}} of peasant farmers, {{many of whom}} joined roving bandit and rebel {{groups such as the}} Red Eyebrows to survive. Wang Mang's armies were incapable of quelling these enlarged rebel groups. Eventually, an insurgent mob forced their way into the Weiyang Palace and killed Wang Mang.|$|E
5|$|Coalhouse Fort is {{exceptionally}} well-preserved; {{it provides}} {{one of the}} finest surviving examples of a mid-Victorian armoured casemate fort. It has twelve casemates arranged in a semi-circle facing south and east towards the river, with an annexed open battery facing south-west. The casemates are faced with massive slabs of granite and have iron gun ports to protect the gunners from splinters <b>dislodged</b> by incoming fire.|$|E
25|$|The strap can be {{adjusted}} to suit the diver's head. Too loose may not provide an effective seal and the mask may <b>dislodge</b> easily, and too tight may result in discomfort or pain. Correct positioning of the strap {{around the back of}} the head will reduce the risk of <b>dislodging</b> and facilitate clearing.|$|R

5|$|In 1199, Tamar's armies led by two Christianised Kurdish generals, Zak'are and Ivane Zakarid-Mkhargrzeli, <b>dislodged</b> the Shaddadid dynasty from Ani, the {{erstwhile}} {{capital of}} the Armenian kingdom, and received it from the queen as their fief. From their base at Ani, the brothers surged ahead into the central Armenian lands, reclaiming one after another fortresses and districts from local Muslim rulers: Bjni was taken in 1201 and Dvin fell in 1203.|$|E
5|$|In the event, Titanics heading changed {{just in time}} {{to avoid}} a head-on collision, but the change in {{direction}} caused the ship to strike the iceberg with a glancing blow. An underwater spur of ice scraped along the starboard side of the ship for about seven seconds; chunks of ice <b>dislodged</b> from upper parts of the berg fell onto her forward decks. A few minutes later, all of Titanics engines were stopped, leaving the ship facing north and drifting in the Labrador Current.|$|E
5|$|Minor {{complications}} {{are common}} after laryngoscopy and insertion of an orotracheal tube. These are typically of short duration, such as sore throat, lacerations of the lips or gums or other structures within the upper airway, chipped, fractured or <b>dislodged</b> teeth, and nasal injury. Other complications which are common but potentially more serious include accelerated or irregular heartbeat, high blood pressure, elevated intracranial and introcular pressure, and bronchospasm.|$|E

5|$|On 8 October 1892, a storm-damaged vessel, Sirene, hit the {{southern}} {{side of the}} pier, causing four shops {{and part of the}} deck to collapse onto the beach below. Several columns were also <b>dislodged,</b> and the ship's bowsprit hit the pier entrance. All eleven crew members were rescued when they were hauled onto the pier. Damage to the pier was estimated to be £5,000 and was promptly repaired.|$|E
5|$|The castle {{remained}} in military ownership, {{but it became}} more of a museum from the 1920s onwards. During the Second World War, the castle was still in service {{as part of the}} Magazine Establishment and was damaged by two enemy bombs which fell in 1941. The bombing <b>dislodged</b> pieces of plaster in the castle's south tower and gatehouse, under which were discovered old graffiti, including a drawing of a ship dated to around 1700.|$|E
5|$|While the Parthians {{regained the}} territories {{lost in the}} west, another threat arose in the east. In 177–176BC the nomadic {{confederation}} of the Xiongnu <b>dislodged</b> the nomadic Yuezhi from their homelands {{in what is now}} Gansu province in Northwest China; the Yuezhi then migrated west into Bactria and displaced the Saka (Scythian) tribes. The Saka were forced to move further west, where they invaded the Parthian Empire's northeastern borders. Mithridates was thus forced to retire to Hyrcania after his conquest of Mesopotamia.|$|E

25|$|The Black Pudding Throwing World Championships {{are held}} {{annually}} at the Royal Oak (now the Oaks) pub on Bridge Street. Participants have to toss black puddings {{in an attempt}} to <b>dislodge</b> a stack of Yorkshire puddings on plinths on two levels (one for children, the other for adults). The winner is the one who <b>dislodges</b> most Yorkshire puddings in three attempts.|$|R
5|$|Also in Arcadia, a Motel 6 {{was badly}} damaged. Other {{structural}} damage {{resulted from the}} shock. For example, both Monrovia and Pasadena each {{had more than a}} dozen buildings that were uninhabitable, {{but for the most part}} damage was limited to cracked plaster and broken windows. The Pasadena City Hall had moderate damage consisting of a cracked wall, <b>dislodged</b> marble barriers in the restrooms, and an offset dome. In Sierra Madre, four apartment buildings and nine homes were also tagged as uninhabitable. Of the more than 100 injuries that were reported in Arcadia, Pasadena, Glendale, and Sierra Madre, most were cuts, bruises, and sprains, but some serious injuries also occurred.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the many}} {{technical}} {{challenges of the}} ion-deposition apparatus was obtaining a sufficiently high ion current (mass deposition rate) while simultaneously decelerating the ions so they could all deposit onto a target electrode embedded in a balance pan. Experiments with gold showed the ions had to be decelerated to very low energies to avoid sputtering effects—a phenomenon whereby ions {{that had already been}} counted ricochet off the target electrode or even <b>dislodged</b> atoms that had already been deposited. The deposited mass fraction in the 2003 German experiments only approached very close to 100% at ion energies of less than around 1eV (<1km/s for gold).|$|E
5|$|An {{entry level}} diver must learn the {{techniques}} of breathing underwater through a demand regulator, including clearing it of water and recovering it if <b>dislodged</b> from the mouth, and clearing the mask if it is flooded. These are critical survival skills, and if not competent the diver is at {{a high risk of}} drowning. A related skill is sharing breathing gas with another diver, both as the donor and the recipient. This is usually done with a secondary demand valve carried for this purpose. Technical and professional divers will also learn how to use a backup gas supply carried in an independent scuba set, known as the emergency gas supply or bailout cylinder.|$|E

5|$|Carruthers came on as a {{substitute}} on 76 minutes in a 2–2 draw away to Premier League team Fulham on 6 January 2008. By February 2008, he had been <b>dislodged</b> at left back by Joe Jacobson, although he made {{a return to the}} team for a 2–0 home victory over Cheltenham Town after Jacobson was unavailable for selection. He made one more appearance before the end of 2007–08, a 1–1 draw at home to Northampton on 12 March 2008, finishing the season with 24 appearances. He was released by the club in May 2008.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the lateral dispersion (by invertebrates and deer) there is also importance {{in the fact that}} burial (vertical dispersion) by ants (or other vectors) increases the survival of new plants by two mechanisms. First, vertical dispersion ensures sufficient depth to preserve the seeds through their dormancy (Trillium seeds are normally dormant for their first year). Second, vertical dispersion ensures adequate anchorage of the rhizomes. This is particularly important for young plants because their small rhizomes, with few & short roots, are easily <b>dislodged</b> (e.g. frost heaveal and other erosion factors) and desiccated.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the earthquake, {{multiple}} phone lines were down, and scattered power outages affected about 54,000 households. Moreover, at least 70 underground 11,000 volt cables sustained some degree of damage, contributing to the outages. The shaking ruptured local water mains, resulting in widespread flooding that affected several streets. Furthermore, officials ordered the closure of bridges in the area as a precautionary measure; one bridge was reported to have succumbed to the strong ground motions. Days after its occurrence, a small electrical fire ignited in a control panel at Christchurch Hospital due to <b>dislodged</b> wiring as a result of ongoing aftershocks.|$|E

5|$|Leake had {{not brought}} many {{supplies}} to Gibraltar but provided what he could, and loaned Hesse the fleet's skilled manpower, {{of which the}} confederate garrison was desperately short. A labour force of some 500 men was assembled from the ships' companies and was put to work repairing the fortifications, remounting guns <b>dislodged</b> by Spanish fire and hauling cannon up the Rock to increase the fire being directed onto the Spanish batteries. One of those involved, Captain Willis, played such a prominent role that the track he used was renamed (and is still known as) Willis' Road, and he also gave his name to Willis' Battery (now Princess Royal's Battery), Magazine and Guard.|$|E
5|$|Like {{many species}} of spider, a P. schultzi lays a {{continuous}} dragline of silk as it moves, {{and from time to}} time anchors the dragline to a surface with a spot of sticky silk. This allows the spider to return to the surface if the animal is <b>dislodged.</b> A spider about to jump first lays a sticky silk anchor, and then lays out a dragline as it flies. Unlike those of most jumping spiders, P. schultzi′s draglines stick to each other and, when a P. schultzi has laid a few lines across a gap, it uses these as walkways and reinforces them with additional silk as it moves.|$|E
5|$|The Battle of Bad Axe {{began at}} about 9:00 am on August 2 after the Americans {{caught up with}} the {{remnants}} of the British Band a few miles downstream {{from the mouth of the}} Bad Axe River. The British Band was reduced to roughly 500 people by this time, including about 150 warriors. The warriors fought with the Americans while the Native noncombatants frantically tried to cross the river. Many made it to one of the two nearby islands, but were <b>dislodged</b> after the steamboat Warrior returned at noon, carrying regulars and Menominees allied with the Americans.|$|E
