40|$|Electronic {{business}} {{is based on}} using computers and networks {{in all aspects of}} business. This new business concept is developing its own culture, which faces many ethical dilemmas. One is the role of chief <b>information</b> <b>officer.</b> As a leader of information technology application in business, the chief <b>information</b> <b>officer's</b> ethical behaviour influences electronic business culture ethics in the organisation. In electronic business both the chief executive <b>officer</b> and chief <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> are responsible for the organisational culture. That is, the chief <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> having capabilities for reasoning, forming values and making information decisions contributes to creating corporate core values. From an employee's prospective the chief <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> is treated as the employer. But being employed by the organisation in a similar way {{to the rest of the}} employees, the chief <b>information</b> <b>officer</b> can be treated as an employee of the organisation.
