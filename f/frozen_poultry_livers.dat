40|$|The present article {{reviews the}} most {{important}} scientiﬁc literature on dioxins and PCBs found in <b>poultry</b> <b>liver</b> and their relation with food safety and consumers’ health. Dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are persistent organic pollutants with high chemical stability; they are lipophilic compounds {{and they are not}} destroyed by microbial, photochemical, chemical or thermal degradation. Dioxins and PCBs are ubiquitous environmental contaminants, which are present in all marine plant and animals, birds, mammals and humans and bioaccumulate through the food chain. In the last years, there has been concern regarding food contamination with different chemical substances and their effect on food safety. More particularly, {{at the end of the}} 20 th and the beginning of the 21 st century, there were a series of incidents related to dioxin and PCBs, which directly affected human or contaminated the soil and accumulated in feed and then in food products, such as <b>poultry</b> <b>liver.</b> It was shown in case of dioxin incident that tetra and penta-chlorinated congeners (the most toxic ones) accumulates selectively in <b>poultry</b> <b>livers.</b> Maximal concentrations have been ﬁxed in the European legislation for dioxins and PCBs in food from animal origin, in order to protect the consumer.

40|$|Aim: Over the years, {{there have}} been {{considerable}} increases in the consumption of <b>frozen</b> <b>poultry</b> foods across Nigeria.

The contamination levels (Enterobacteriaceae and Listeria counts) and the presence of pathogenic E. coli, Salmonella and Listeria along the processing line of sale of <b>frozen</b> <b>poultry</b> foods were assayed in retail outlets. Methodology and results: Bacteriological counts and bacterial isolation were carried out using standard plate methods, while the direct slide agglutination technique was utilized for serology. Bacteriological assay revealed extremely high counts (Listeria count (LC) : 7. 784 ± 1. 109 - 9. 586 ± 0. 016 log cfu/cm 2; Enterobacteriaceae count (EC) : 7. 151 ± 0. 213 - 9. 318 ± 0. 161 log cfu/cm 2), higher than stipulated by International Food Standard Agencies. The highest count for EC (9. 318 ± 0. 161 log cfu/cm 2) and LC 9. 586 ± 0. 016 log cfu/cm 2) was from the weighing scale and processing table. Averagely, LC (8. 598 ± 0. 733 log cfu/cm 2) was higher than EC (8. 145 ± 0. 936 log cfu/cm 2). Weighing scale had counts significantly different (p < 0. 05) from all others for EC. But there were no significant differences in LC. Weighing scale and meat tables were critical control points (CCPs) in the processing line for sale of <b>frozen</b> <b>poultry</b> meats in the retail outlets. E. coli spp., E. coli O 157 :H 7, Salmonella spp., Salmonella Enteritidis, Listeria spp. and Listeria monocytogenes were isolated along the processing line.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the occurrence and the enumeration of Clostridium perfringens in ground poultry and burgers using the MPN technique and selected biochemical tests, including acid phosphatase and reverse-CAMP tests. Forty raw <b>frozen</b> ground <b>poultry</b> and 40 <b>frozen</b> <b>poultry</b> burger samples were purchased from different poultry processing plants in Turkey, between June and December 2000. The samples were taken aseptically and transported to the laboratory in refrigerated containers and tested the same day. C. perfringens was isolated from 28 (70. 0 %) of the 40 ground poultry samples at the mean number of 2. 6 MPN/g. The minimal and maximal numbers of ground poultry samples positive for C. perfringens varied from 0. 30 to 9. 3 MPN/g. Only 1 (2. 5 %) of the 40 poultry burger samples was positive for C. perfringes at the mean number of 0. 36 MPN/g. C. perfringens was found higher in the warm months of July to early September (67. 9 %) than in October to late December (32. 1 %) in 28 positive poultry ground samples. Only one poultry burger sample positive for C. perfringens was taken in July. In conclusion, ground poultry may be considered a significant source of C. perfringens mainly in warm months.

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to evaluate the antimicrobial resistance and the biofilm-producing ability of Salmonella sp. strains isolated from <b>frozen</b> <b>poultry</b> carcasses. Antimicrobial susceptibility was tested by the disk-diffusion method. Biofilm-producing ability was determined in 96 -well polystyrene microplates stained with crystal violet at 1 %. Out of the 22 strains tested, all were multiresistant, that is, resistant to more than three antimicrobial classes, and 72. 7 % were able to form biofilms. The highest resistance rates obtained were against sulfonamides, tetracycline, and quinolones. On the other hand, 100 % of the strains were sensitive to chloramphenicol. According to the rate of biofilm formation, 3 (13. 6 %) and 13 (59. 1 %) strains were classified as moderate and weak biofilm-producers, respectively, and 27. 3 % did not form biofilms. Biofilms increase the tolerance of microorganisms to stress, reducing their sensitivity to disinfectants and antimicrobials; favor equipment corrosion; and act as substrates for the adhesion of bacteria with lower biofilm-producing capacity.
