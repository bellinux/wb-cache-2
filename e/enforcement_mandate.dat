40|$|The three {{surgical}} patient safety events, wrong site surgery, retained surgical items (RSI) and surgical fires are rare occurrences and thus {{their effects on}} the complex modern operating room (OR) are difficult to study. The likelihood of occurrence and the magnitude of risk {{for each of these}} surgical safety events are undefined. Many providers may never have a personal experience with one of these events and training and education on these topics are sparse. These circumstances lead to faulty thinking that a provider won&#x 2019;t ever have an event or if one does occur the provider will intuitively know what to do. Surgeons are not preoccupied with failure and tend to usually consider good outcomes, which leads them to ignore or diminish the importance of implementing and following simple safety practices. These circumstances contribute to the persistent low level occurrence of these three events and to the difficulty in generating sufficient interest to resource solutions. Individual facilities rarely have the time or talent to understand these events and develop lasting solutions. More often than not, even the most well meaning internal review results in a new line to a policy and some rigorous <b>enforcement</b> <b>mandate.</b> This approach routinely fails and is another reason why these problems are so persistent. Vigilance actions alone have been unsuccessful so hospitals now have to take a systematic approach to implementing safer processes and providing the resources for surgeons and other stakeholders to optimize the OR environment. This article discusses standardized processes of care for mitigation of injury or outright prevention of wrong site surgery, RSI and surgical fires in an action-oriented framework illustrating the strategic elements important in each event and focusing on the responsibilities {{for each of the three}} major OR agents-anesthesiologists, surgeons and nurses.

40|$|MM - P&DMIn March 2002, the Department of Transport {{published}} the Ports Policy with {{the objectives of}} ensuring affordable, internationally competitive, efficient and safe port services and of restructuring port governance and operations and subsequently regulating them. The 2005 Ports Act officially separated operations from a landlord function within ports and further established the Ports Authority to own, manage, control and administer ports to ensure their efficient economic functioning. The Ports Act also established the Ports Regulator to exercise economic regulation of the ports system as well as monitor {{the activities of the}} Ports Authority. In addition, the Ports Regulations were developed, setting out the BEE targets that the Ports Authority should achieve in order to promote the economic participation and empowerment of historically disadvantaged groups in port operations. The Regulations further mandated the Ports Regulator to monitor and enforce implementation of the BEE targets when the Ports Authority would be issuing licences or granting concessions in port operations. This monitoring and enforcement function would be exercised through annual reports to be submitted by the Ports Authority, and through hearings that may be conducted by the Ports Regulator from time to time. This study found that the reasons for entrusting the Ports Regulator with the BEE monitoring and <b>enforcement</b> <b>mandate,</b> although not known to everybody, could have been orchestrated by Transnet because the Ports Regulator was seen to be less powerful than the Maritime BEE Charter Council. In addition, Transnet also developed guidelines for granting concessions, licences and permits for ‘auxiliary port services’ and not port operations. These would test the regulatory capability of the Ports Regulator hence it would require preventative enforcement measures in addition to harm-based enforcement measures that are in place (namely, annual reports and hearings). This study also established that having departmental officials on the Board of the Ports Regulator appeared to be in the latter’s best ii interests although it has to strengthen measures meant to curb the financial interests of board members and develop independent capacity for informationgathering, since implementing its mandate of monitoring and enforcing BEE will indeed be an intractable affair...|$|E

40|$|This article {{considers}} the military doctrine currently {{available to the}} African Standby Force (ASF) for peace operations (PO) on the African continent. In {{the absence of an}} updated and relevant doctrine for PO, risks are posed to the harmonization and coordination of multinational missions, {{as well as to the}} successful achievement of mission objectives. Despite laudable efforts by both the United Nations (UN) and bilateral donor nations to support the preparatory and continuation training of ASF troops, differences in the national and multinational experiences of this work and the differences in the legal basis of this doctrine do not provide an optimal ‘stop gap’ measure. The pressing new requirement for African peace missions to deter terrorist and insurgent anti-peace factions exposes the limitations of UN doctrine, which preserves traditional peacekeeping principles of consent, impartiality and minimum use of force. UN peace <b>enforcement</b> <b>mandates,</b> and guidance derived from NATO’s non-African experiences do not provide adequate guidance for ASF troops preparing to enter these operating environments.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with how Irish peacekeeping policy and practice has evolved {{in response to the}} changing nature of international peacekeeping. It asks specific questions about how changes in international peacekeeping doctrine {{since the end of the}} Cold War have affected Irish peacekeeping policy and practice, and why, in the light of a more general disengagement by Western countries from peacekeeping, Ireland has continued to commit to a strong presence in international peacekeeping. The thesis explains what international peacekeeping is and describes the evolution of Irish peacekeeping policy and practice by reviewing the political and legislative changes in peacekeeping policy and the changing practices of peacekeeping by the Irish defence forces. In addition, four peacekeeping missions have been chosen as case studies; two of United Nations traditional peacekeeping missions and two of Regional Organisations peace-enforcement missions, namely, Lebanon, Côte d’Ivoire, Kosovo and Chad. The thesis will argue that Irish peacekeeping policy and practice has evolved slowly and has become a hybrid in which interpretation of <b>enforcement</b> <b>mandates</b> are conditioned by values and norms and organisational conventions which stretch back deeply into the force’s history. This thesis will argue that this is a not weakness, but a strength. Irish foreign policy prioritises a well regulated international environment and to that end Ireland is committed to active participation in international peacekeeping. This reflects a strong belief among politicians that peacekeeping helps to consolidate Irish international standing. The Irish army has an institutional interest in participation in peace enforcement operations with United Nations and Regional Organisations; indeed without such engagements it would have been reduced long ago to a very limited domestic range of functions to do with internal security and ceremonial. However, United Nations peacekeeping operations remain the main function of the Irish defence forces, enjoys cross-party political support, and continues to be a source of Irish patriotic pride...|$|R
40|$|The {{aggregated}} {{lifestyles and}} behaviors of individuals impose significant environmental harms yet remain largely unregulated. A growing literature recognizes the environmental significance of individual behaviors, critiques the failure of environmental law and policy to capture harms traceable to individual behaviors, and suggests and evaluates strategies for capturing individual harms going forward. This Article contributes to the existing literature by approaching the problem of environmentally significant individual harms {{through the lens of}} environmental federalism. Using climate change and individual greenhouse gas (‘CHG’) emissions as an exemplar, the Article illustrates how local information, local governments, and local implementation can enhance policies designed to capture individual environmental harms. Local information and community-level implementation may enhance norm management efforts designed to influence GHG-emitting behaviors by (1) allowing for the identification of concrete behaviors that are feasible to target through norm management in a given community; (2) informing the design and content of norm campaigns, including the selection of the abstract norm that will form the basis of the appeal for specific behavioral change; and (3) facilitating effective implementation strategies. This framework supports a preference for local action expressed, but to date largely unexamined, in the broader norm management literature. Additionally, the Article argues that obstacles to using mandates to influence GHG-emitting behaviors may be less formidable when mandates are developed and enforced locally. Local development and <b>enforcement</b> of <b>mandates</b> can reduce intrusion objections because (1) individuals are accustomed to local control over day-today behaviors; (2) familiarity with local attitudes and practices enables the design of mandates that avoid intrusion objections; and (3) local governments are {{in a better position to}} structure time, place, and manner restrictions that channel behavior while preserving some individual choice. Local design and <b>enforcement</b> of <b>mandates</b> may also minimize the key enforcement challenges of expense, numerosity, and (in) visibility...|$|R

40|$|We {{define the}} notion of the application-oriented {{security}} policy and suggest that it differs from that of a system-level, global security policy. We view a policy as a conjunction of security properties and argue that these properties are not always independent and, hence, cannot be analyzed (e. g., composed) individually. We also argue that some necessary policy properties fall outside of the Alpern-Schneider safety/liveness domain and, hence, are not subject to the Abadi-Lamport composition principle. We suggest several areas of research in policy definition, composition, and administration. 1 Application-Oriented Security Policies We distinguish an application-oriented (a-o) security policy from a system-level, global security policy by three characteristics, namely, (1) locality of <b>enforcement,</b> (2) <b>mandated</b> composability with other a-o policies, and (3) mandated compatibility with the application itself.

40|$|Sex {{offenders}} {{have become}} targets {{of some of}} the most far-reaching and novel crime legislation in the United States. Two key innovations have been registration and notification laws, which, respectively, require that offenders provide identifying information to law <b>enforcement</b> and <b>mandate</b> that this information be made fully public. We study how registration and notification affect the frequency and incidence across victims of reported sex offenses. We present evidence that registration reduces the frequency of reported sex offenses against local victims (for example, neighbors) by keeping police informed about local sex offenders. Notification also appears to reduce crime, not by disrupting the criminal conduct of convicted sex offenders, but by deterring nonregistered offenders. We find that notification may actually increase recidivism. This latter finding, consistent with the idea that notification imposes severe costs that offset the benefits to offenders of forgoing criminal activity, is significant, given that notification’s purpose is recidivism reduction. ...|$|R

It suggests where evaluation is required in order to test further the sorts of options available to policy-makers to deter corporate wrong-doing and prevent irresponsible practices. These methods and regulatory options are becoming increasingly needed, given the inadequacies and inefficiencies of the current legal framework and the public rhetoric that suggests that the best response is (simply) more law...|$|R

3000|$|The {{marginal}} effects {{associated with}} self-employment tenure {{have a negative}} effect on informality propensities. We find that working fewer hours increases informality probabilities. Qualified professionals are more likely to be formal than non-professionals, although the marginal effect falls from 12 percentage points in 2006 to 6 percentage points in 2009 for men. Self-employed women living in the two largest cities tend to register as self-employed, but the magnitude is dissimilar across time. That is, the negative marginal effect was 13.5 percentage points in 2006 and 2.1 percentage points in 2009. For men, the negative and significant effects in Astana and Almaty disappeared after the crisis struck. This result probably relates to the diminished relative attractiveness of formalisation in these two cities and variation in local government authorities’ <b>enforcement</b> of <b>mandated</b> business regulations during the macro-economic crisis of 2008 – 09. Thus, some individuals find it difficult to comply in such an environment and simply perceive informal self-employment as a worthy alternative. Comparing the ‘uncorrected’ regression results with the double probit estimates, we find that the probit regression coefficients are different in statistical significance (e.g., Kazakh and Professional) and lower in magnitudes. Finally, the positive and significant selectivity coefficient (Rho) suggests positive sorting into self-employment and indicates that it was necessary to correct for the selection bias problem. 17 [...]...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to present an {{analysis}} of China's decentralization and local governance practices, the dilemmas rooted in the current institution. We argue that the misbehavior of local government officials is endogenous to China's central-local structure and that competition among localities has become distorted and constrained by various policy burdens and development mandates imposed from above. The information asymmetry for the <b>enforcement</b> cost of <b>mandates</b> that exists between central and local governments not only leads to difficulties and distortions in local performance evaluations, but also creates opportunities for local bureaucracy expansion and rent-seeking.
