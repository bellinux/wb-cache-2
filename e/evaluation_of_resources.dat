Lack of evaluation in various organizational dimensions, such as <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and facilities, employees, and organizational goals and strategies is considered a serious disadvantage of organizations. Moreover, lack of evaluation in a system is regarded as lack of communication with internal and external environments which leads to organizational senility and, ultimately, death.

40|$|Background Much {{attention}} has been given to identifying and supporting the minority of patients who develop severe clinical depression after a cardiac event. However, relatively little has been given to supporting the many patients who experience transient but significant emotional disturbance that we term the ‘cardiac blues’. Objective The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate patients’ preferences regarding information provision about cardiac blues. Methods One hundred and sixty consecutive cardiac patients admitted to two Victorian hospitals in Australia were interviewed three times over six months. They were asked about emotional issues, including information provision preferences. Results Four out of five (81 %) patients would like to have received information about the cardiac blues, but only a minority received this information. Conclusion Most patients want to know about cardiac blues. The development and <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> for health professionals and patients to support recovery through cardiac blues appears warranted. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Metallurgy {{represents}} complex technological chain {{supplied with}} {{different kinds of}} primary resources. Iron metallurgy based on blast-furnace process, dominates in world steel production. Metallurgical coke is the basic fuel in this case. Its production is connected with several environmental disadvantageous impacts. One {{of them is the}} extended production chain from primary energy to final energy. The reduction of coke consumption in the process can be achieved e. g. by injection of auxiliary fuels or increasing the thermal parameters in the process. In present injection of pulverised coal dominates while recirculation of top-gas seems to be future technology. However, the latter one requires the CO 2 removal that additionally extended the production chain. The <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> management in complex energy-technological systems required application of advanced method based on thermodynamics. In the paper the system exergo-ecological assessment of pulverised coal injection into blast-furnace and top-gas recirculation has been applied. As a comparative criterion the thermo-ecological cost has been proposed...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the influence of resources and capabilities in the firms’ innovation. This study was carried out in three enterprises of the electric/electronic industry in Brazil. It included enterprises of three different segments: building automation, telecommunications and industrial automation. Resource Based-View was used to develop a framework for analysis of the combination of resources and competences to innovate. The firm, motivated to innovate, develop a pool of resources and competences, resulting in innovations offered to the market. The criteria for assessing the strategic value of the innovations were four characteristics proposed by Barney (1991) for <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources.</b> The strategic innovation should be valuable, rare, difficult to imitate and without equivalent substitute. The results indicate that there are two main competences for the development of strategic innovations in enterprises: abilities to cooperate and to obtain financing. Of the three projects evaluated, only one has all the four characteristics that leads to strategic innovation...|$|E
40|$|Abstract:- Recommendation {{systems are}} the agents {{that help the}} learner to {{identify}} a subset of suitable learning resources {{from a variety of}} choices. Recommendation Systems is a widely explored field since the last decade. Much of the work is going on in recommendation systems that are based on the <b>evaluation</b> <b>of</b> <b>resources</b> and users‟ data. In this paper we concentrate on E-Learning Recommendation Systems. An E-learning recommendation system is a derivative field of recommendation systems in which the resources are specifically the available bulk of learning material either online or offline. The aim of E-learning software is to select the useful piece of material which the learner actually requires to study. Our aim in this paper is to study various recommendation techniques with their virtues and shortcomings. Further we will discuss E-learning recommendation systems with a brief review of some major milestones in the field of E-Learning.
