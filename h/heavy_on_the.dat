25|$|In 2002 {{extended}} exits for Junction 12 were constructed. The Highways Agency did {{not anticipate}} the traffic flows through the junction and the resultant queues can now extend back onto the motorway. This is because {{of an increase in}} traffic from Stroud intending to use the M5 northbound. The distance from Junctions 12 and 13 is similar and traffic congestion is <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> A419 towards Junction 13 whereas it is usually lighter on the B4008 towards Junction 12. As traffic leaving the M5 northbound towards Gloucester needs to give way to this traffic coming from the B4008, the queue on the motorway can extend beyond the first sign for the junction. More improvements are scheduled, as at 2010.|$|E

The band then {{earned a}} spot in the Guinness Book of World Records for the highest-paid single appearance of a band: $1.5million for a 90-minute set at the 1983 US Festival. Despite this return to form, Roth and Eddie's differences continued, and this caused friction with other band members. Billy Sheehan, after his band Talas completed a tour with Van Halen, claims he was approached by Eddie Van Halen to replace Michael Anthony. The reasons for this were never clear to Sheehan because nothing came of it. During this time, Eddie and Alex Van Halen contributed the score and instrumental songs to the movie The Wild Life, starring Eric Stoltz. The score was <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> keyboards, similar to the sound used on the previous two albums and much more like the sound coming in their next album.|$|E

[...] Mof Gimmers of TV Scoop praised the episode for having [...] "a refreshing {{change from the}} usual theme of this series", with Rhys' performance and the sub plot of the Sugarhorse story arc adding [...] "definitely {{one of the best}} stories so far in what has been an impressive series, if a little <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Islamic terrorist side at times.

Her vocal work has been compared to Tori Amos, Kate Bush, and The Creatures. She has released two instrumental albums (On a Day... and Laced/Unlaced), and four featuring her vocals: Enchant, Opheliac, A Bit o' This & That, and [...] "Fight Like A Girl". The 2003 album Enchant drew on [...] "new age chamber music, trip hop baroque, and experimental space pop". Autumn layers her voice frequently, and incorporates electronics and electronic effects into her work on Enchant; she also combines strings and piano for some songs, while others feature mainly the piano or violin. The 2006 release Opheliac featured [...] "cabaret, electronic, symphonic, new age, and good ol' rock & roll (and <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> theatrical bombast)".|$|E

Mueller praised the soundtrack and dialogue, stating that {{the best part of}} the game [...] "is easily the sound", and that the voice of any character fits their role [...] "perfectly", making them more interesting than [...] "the average voice-over". Reed also praised Baker's role in the game, stating that voice-overs and audio were the most enjoyable experiences in Resurrection, also citing that Baker's voice performance was [...] "majestic" [...] and [...] "eccentric". Chris Scantleberry of GameSpy felt that the overall dialogue was <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stereotypical accent, but was assured that players would enjoy the [...] "electric atmosphere" [...] of MediEvil, which he often compared to that of Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas.|$|E

He also pointed out the areas currently under communist control which {{would have to be}} retaken. The key to the location of these operations were concentrations of natural resources – rice, rubber, industry, etc. Those areas that were to be held also included coastal areas where oil had been discovered on the continental shelf. These areas were to become, in Thiệu's words: [...] "Our untouchable heartland, the irreducible national stronghold." [...] As {{to the future of the}} I and II Corps Zones, he drew a series of phase lines on the map indicating that South Vietnamese forces should hold what they could, but that they could redeploy southward as circumstances dictated.

[...] Carter Dotson of TV Fanatic gave the episode a 4.4 rating and called the episode and its sister episode, [...] "No Country Club for Old Men", [...] "a perfect representation of the wild extremes of this season." [...] He added [...] "it wasn't the funniest episode, but the way the parallel stories worked and intertwined was at least extremely interesting, lacking much of the lazy humor that at times plagued this season. Mark Trammell of TV Equals said [...] "All in all, an okay episode that benefited from the combination approach, but MacFarlane might want to retire both the time travel stuff and the [...] "road picture"-approach after this one, as the well is clearly running dry [...] To tell the truth, I didn't laugh as much as I wanted to".|$|E
500|$|Music writer Robert Christgau said Saadiq's {{compositions}} {{are characterized}} by [...] "groove rather than song". Andy Kellman of AllMusic wrote that the songs are [...] "tied together by the Mellotron, a vintage keyboard — commonly associated with psychedelic and progressive rock recordings, but not foreign to soul — that evokes diseased flutes and wheezing strings", adding that [...] "Saadiq tends to use the instrument for shading". Music journalist Jim DeRogatis observed [...] "a little less Motown gloss" [...] than The Way I See It and [...] "a little more rock grit in Saadiq’s grooves, <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Sly Stone (witness the opening 'Heart Attack'), late '50s/early '60s Isley Brothers (the joyful 'Radio'), and Ray Charles ('Day Dreams'), {{to say nothing of}} the skillful use of Mellotron orchestrations as a connecting thread throughout the disc, sort of like the Moody Blues suddenly finding the funk ('The Answer')." [...] Steve Horowitz from PopMatters found the songs' subject matter to be assorted and said that Saadiq [...] "personalizes each song so they seem connected as just the many aspects of one man’s existence and experience".|$|E

He criticized [...] "Octavarium" [...] as [...] "bloated", although noted that fans of the band's A Change of Seasons would enjoy it. He said that [...] "there's enough on the remainder of Octavarium to keep {{the rest of us}} interested and the prog rock haters whining dismissively". Writing for Exclaim!, Greg Pratt praised the album's artwork and production, but said that [...] "there’s nothing that blows any minds here, or even gives a mild bend; hell, a good chunk of this disc feels like basic radio rock from the local old-guy bar band". He noted that although there were some longer songs on the album, [...] "this just feels like 76 minutes of overdramatic rock, too <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> light and weak, and not enough time spent on just showing off".|$|E

500|$|Along with Spears's {{performance}} specifically, [...] "Ten Sessions" [...] {{as a whole}} {{was generally}} well received by television critics. In television critics Alan Sepinwall and Matt Zoler Seitz's 2016 book TV (The Book), Sepinwall singles out this episode (along with Slap Bet) as episodes where he [...] "will still laugh, and be touched, and marvel at just how inventive a traditional-looking sitcom can be". [...] Bowman gave the episode a 'B' grade, and was more critical of [...] "Ten Sessions". She expressed: [...] "the timing wasn't spot-on all the way through 'Ten Sessions'. The episode was slow starting, and as with many of the series' 'Ted is a master of romance' attempts, the two-minute date seemed as likely to be annoying-quirky as endearing-quirky, if you were the one being wooed. I wanted to like it more than I did. Maybe it almost works because Elliot on Scrubs would have really liked it, ditzy romantic that she is. But no — it's just an ounce <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> trying-too-hard scale." [...] In contrast, Zoromski gave the episode an 8.9 out of ten, signifying a [...] "great" [...] rating.

500|$|Roger Ebert {{awarded the}} film 2.5 out of 4, saying [...] "This isn't a great heist movie {{for a lot}} of reasons, {{beginning}} with the stupidity of its heist plan and the impossibility of these characters ever being successful at anything more complex than standing in line," [...] but appreciated that the comedy did not [...] "go <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> excremental, the masturbatory and symphonies of four-letter words", calling it [...] "funny in an innocent screwball kind of way." [...] Entertainment Weeklys Lisa Schwarzbaum called the film [...] "overblinged, eye-catching, and essentially tacky," [...] and praised Murphy, saying [...] "when Murphy is on screen, his comedic vigor... gooses the movie's energy level... but whenever Murphy wanders off, the movie's pulse rate drops. Tower Heist is in effect two movies: One belongs to Murphy, the other {{to the rest of the}} cast." [...] Time Out Londons Trevor Johnston said that [...] "though it's hard to get excited by this amiable potboiler, Tower Heist is so at home with its limitations it's equally hard to dislike," [...] but criticized the finale [...] "which might have been a bit more tense had we been able to take it remotely seriously." [...] Conversely, Time Out New Yorks David Fear gave it 2 out of 5 stars, saying [...] "one nail-biting moment and some much-missed Murphy mouthiness won't keep you from feeling like you're the one being ripped off." ...|$|E
500|$|Steve Palopoli of Metro Silicon Valley said, [...] "Musically, {{the show}} is <b>heavy</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> hits, {{although}} considering Britney as a musical phenomenon is like asking which of Madonna's albums is best. She's a cultural phenomenon, obviously, and the only edicts {{that seem to have}} been handed down in regards to the music is 'no lip-synching' (she definitely doesn't) and 'bigger and louder whenever possible.'" [...] Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated it was [...] "entertaining", but Spears [...] "doesn’t quite have that spring in her dance step anymore and who requires a constant barrage of visual distractions while she mostly lip-synchs along to her hits". Jim Harrington of the Oakland Tribune deemed the show as [...] "a mess pretty much from start to finish. The theatrics are awkward and confusing, the dance routines are numbingly bland and old-hat, the song selection is weak and misguided, and Britney's star power, so blinding on tours past, is remarkably dim." [...] Alexis Petridis of The Guardian gave the show two stars out of five, saying that [...] "there's a suspicion that {{the kind of person who}} goes to see Britney Spears live isn't really there for the music or her sparkling personality: tonight she seems as dead-eyed and distant as ever. What they're interested in is proximity to a global celebrity." [...] Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph gave the show one star out of five, and called it [...] "the saddest, laziest, dullest and most tawdry pop concert I have ever witnessed." [...] He added that [...] "the most amazing thing about the whole second-rate spectacle was that thousands of people, having forked out around £50 a head for tickets, practically raised the roof, cheering every dismal dance move, roaring for lip-synched vocals and lustily applauding limp erotica." ...|$|E
