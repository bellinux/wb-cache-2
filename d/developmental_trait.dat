While fixed carbon rapidly reached the roots of wild type and agb 1 - 2 mutant seedlings, agb 1 roots had more of this fixed carbon in the form of glucose, fructose, and sucrose which manifested as a higher lateral root density. Upon glucose treatment, the agb 1 - 2 mutant had abnormal gene expression in the root tip validated by transcriptome analysis. In addition, PIN 2 membrane localization and level was altered in the agb 1 - 2 mutant. The heterotrimeric G protein complex integrates photosynthesis-derived sugar signaling incorporating both membrane-and transcriptional-based mechanisms.

We analyze {{the origin of}} a novel <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> of Dictyostelid amoebae: the evolution of cAMP as a developmental chemoattractant. We show that cAMP's role of attracting starving amoebae arose through recruitment of a pathway that originally evolved to coordinate fruiting body morphogenesis. Orthologues of the high-affinity cAMP receptor (cAR), cAR 1, were identified in a selection of species that span the Dictyostelid phylogeny. The cAR 1 orthologue from the basal species Dictyostelium minutum restored aggregation and development when expressed in an aggregation-defective mutant of the derived species Dictyostelium discoideum that lacks high-affinity cARs, thus demonstrating that the D. minutum cAR is a fully functional cAR. cAR 1 orthologues from basal species are expressed during fruiting body formation, and only this process, and not aggregation, was disrupted by abrogation of cAR 1 function. This {{is in contrast to}} derived species, where cAR 1 is also expressed during aggregation and critically regulates this process. Our data show that coordination of fruiting body formation is the ancestral function of extracellular cAMP signaling, whereas its derived role in aggregation evolved by recruitment of a preexisting pathway to an earlier stage of development.

40|$|The {{pattern of}} {{development}} of the inflorescence is an important characteristic in ornamental plants, where the economic value is in the flower. The genetic determinism of inflorescence architecture is poorly understood, especially in woody perennial plants with long life cycles. Our objective was to study the genetic determinism of this characteristic in rose. The genetic architectures of 10 traits associated with the developmental timing and architecture of the inflorescence, and with flower production were investigated in a F 1 diploid garden rose population, based on intensive measurements of phenological and morphological traits in a field. There were substantial genetic variations in inflorescence development traits, with broad-sense heritabilities ranging from 0. 82 to 0. 93. Genotypic correlations were significant for most (87 %) pairs of traits, suggesting either pleiotropy or tight linkage among loci. However, non-significant and low correlations between some pairs of traits revealed two independent developmental pathways controlling inflorescence architecture: (1) the production of inflorescence nodes {{increased the number of}} branches and the production of flowers; (2) internode elongation connected with frequent branching increased the number of branches and the production of flowers. QTL mapping identified six common QTL regions (cQTL) for inflorescence <b>developmental</b> <b>traits.</b> A QTL for flowering time and many inflorescence traits were mapped to the same cQTL.

40|$|Address {{correspondence}} to Dr Nelson at the address above. The grass stage is an inherent and distinctive <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> of longleaf pine (PinuspaLtcrtris), in which height {{growth in the}} first few years after germination is suppressed. In operational forestry practice the grass stage extends for nvo to several years and often plays a role in planting failures and decisions to plant alternative species. Interspecies hybrids involving IobloUy (P. taeda) and slash (P. clliottii var. elliottiz) pines have been investigated as a means to produce planting stock with improved early height growth and to develop backcross populations for advanced generation breeding. We have reevaluated data from several interspecies populations, with the objective of estimating the number of genes contributing to the difference in first-year height growth between longleaf and loblolly pines. Estimates based on means and variances of parental and interspecies hybrid and backcross families suggest a minimum of 4 to 10 genes with standard errors less than half the estimates. These results suggest that the grass stage has evolved through the accumulation of alleles at several loci, each with small effects on various components of first-year height growth. Given the complexity of the grass-stage trait, tree breeders may need to combine genetic marker analysis with recurrent backcross breeding to efficiently develop longleaf pine planting stock for improved reforestation.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Larvae {{from diverse}} marine-invertebrate phyla {{are able to}} respond rapidly to {{environmental}} cues to settlement and to undergo very rapid metamor-phic morphogenesis because they share the <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> of metamorphic competence. The competent state, characteristic of larvae as diverse as those of cnidarian planulae, molluscan veligers, and barnacle cyprids, {{is one in which}} near-ly all requisite juvenile characters are present in the larva prior to settlement. Thus metamorphosis, in response to more or less specific environmental cues (in-ducers), is mainly restricted to loss of larva-specific structures and physiological processes. Competent larvae of two ‘‘model marine invertebrates’ ’ studied in the authors ’ laboratory, the serpulid polychaete Hydroides elegans and the nudibranch Phestilla sibogae, complete metamorphosis in about 12 and 20 hr, respectively. Furthermore, little or no de novo gene action appears to be required during the metamorphic induction process in these species. Contrasting greatly with the slow, hormonally regulated metamorphic transitions of vertebrates and insects, compe-tence and consequent rapid metamorphosis in marine invertebrate larvae are con-jectured to have arisen in diverse phylogenetic clades because they allow larvae to continue to swim and feed in the planktonic realm while simultaneously permitting extremely fast morphological transition from larval locomotory and feeding modes to a different set of such modes that are adaptive to life on the sea bottom...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Differentiation of {{long and}} short shoots is an {{important}} <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> in several species of the Rosaceae family. However, the physiological mechanisms controlling this differentiation are largely unknown. We have studied the role of gibberellin (GA) in regulation of shoot differentiation in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cv. Korona. In strawberry, differentiation of axillary buds to runners (long shoot) or to crown branches (short shoot) is promoted by long-day and short-day conditions, respectively. Formation of crown branches {{is a prerequisite for}} satisfactory flowering because inflorescences are formed from the apical meristems of the crown. Results We found that both prohexadione-calcium and short photoperiod inhibited runner initiation and consequently led to induction of crown branching. In both cases, this correlated with a similar decline in GA 1 level. Exogenous GA 3 completely reversed the effect of prohexadione-calcium in a long photoperiod, but was only marginally effective in short-day grown plants. However, transfer of GA 3 -treated plants from short days to long days restored the normal runner formation. This did not occur in plants that were not treated with GA 3. We also studied GA signalling homeostasis and found that the expression levels of several GA biosynthetic, signalling and target genes were similarly affected by prohexadione-calcium and short photoperiod in runner tips and axillary buds, respectively. Conclusion GA is needed for runner initiation in strawberry, and the inhibition of GA biosynthesis leads to the formation of crown branches. Our findings of similar changes in GA levels and in GA signalling homeostasis after prohexadione-calcium and short-day treatments, and photoperiod-dependent responsiveness of the axillary buds to GA indicate that GA plays a role also in the photoperiod-regulated differentiation of axillary buds. We propose that tightly regulated GA activity may control induction of cell division in subapical tissues of axillary buds, being one of the signals determining bud fate. </p...|$|E

40|$|Vegetative {{development}} in maize {{can be divided}} into juvenile and adult phases, each, with distinct anatomy and physiology. Transition from juvenile to adult vegetative growth may have some adaptive value since adult leaves have increased photosynthetic rates, xeromorphism, and resistance to certain insects and diseases. Variation in the timing of this transition (i. e., the node(s) at which phase change occurs) may be associated with agronomic performance. Our objectives were to investigate the genetics of the timing of vegetative phase change and the relationship between phase-specific developmental and agronomically important traits in a diallel among open-pollinated sweet corn cultivars. Significant variability existed for most developmental traits evaluated in this study. Environmental effects were significant for some traits, whereas genotype x environment interaction (G x E) was significant only for number of leaves above the ear. General combining ability was significant and specific combining ability was not significant for most phase-specific developmental traits. Last leaf with juvenile wax and first leaf with adult wax were positively correlated. Ear leaf and total leaf number were not correlated with other phase-specific developmental traits. Flowering time was negatively correlated with first leaf with adult wax but was not correlated with last leaf with juvenile wax or last node with adventitious roots, indicating that some aspects of vegetative phase change are not associated with the transition to reproductive growth. Yield was not associated with any <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> in this study. First leaf with adult wax and last leaf with juvenile wax may be useful in selection indices, since they were not influenced by the environment, had no G x E interaction in this study, and have been associated with insect and disease resistance in previous studies.

S[subscript] 0 and S[subscript] 1 populations of three pearl millet composites were evaluated for an array of agronomic and developmental traits. Parent-offspring heritability values ranged from 0. 46 to 0. 64 for panicle size and seed traits, from 0. 27 to 0. 58 for productivity traits, and from 0. 16 to 0. 32 for partitioning traits, when averaged over three pearl millet composites. Interrelationships among traits were identified by factor analyses and found to be similar in the three composites. Unique groups of traits were associated with biological yield, panicle size, and seed factors. Certain traits, however, were associated with both the biological yield and the partitioning factors.

40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 6 DEC 1998 In the skeleton, {{male and female}} characteristics lie along a continuum of morphologic configurations and metric values. Size alone {{is not the best}} indicator of sex. In contrast, morphologic differences that arise from genetically sex-linked growth and development allow better separation of the sexes. This study presents a new morphologic indicator of sexual dimorphism in the human mandible. A sample of 300 mandibles from adults of known sex primarily from the Dart collection was analyzed. Of these, 100 were found to have obvious bony pathologies and/or excessive tooth loss ("pathologic" sample). Thus, the normative sample consisted of 200 individuals (116 males, 84 females). Examination of morphologic features led to the discovery of a distinct angulation of the posterior border of the mandibular ramus {{at the level of the}} occlusal surface of the molars in adult males. Flexure appears to be a male <b>developmental</b> <b>trait</b> because it is only manifest consistently after adolescence. In most females, the posterior border of the ramus retained the straight juvenile shape. If flexure was noted, it was found to occur either at a higher point near the neck of the condyle or lower in association with gonial prominence or eversion. In the normative sample, overall prediction accuracy from ramus shape was 99 %. When the "pathologic" sample was analyzed separately, 91. 0 % were correctly diagnosed. Because the African samples were overwhelmingly black, this trait was also tested on American samples (N = 247) of whites (N = 85), Amerinds (N = 66), and blacks (N = 96) that included a mix of healthy individuals and those with extensive tooth loss and evidence of pathology. The results were nearly identical to those of the "pathologic" African sample, with accuracies ranging from about 91 % in whites and blacks to over 92 % in Amerinds. Total accuracy for all African and American samples combined (N = 547) is 94. 2 %. In conclusion, at 99 %, sexing from the shape of the ramus of a healthy mandible is on a par with accuracy attainable from a complete pelvis. Moreover, there is no record that any other single morphologic or metric indicator of sex (that has been quantified from the adult skeleton) surpasses the overall accuracy attained from the more representative mixed sample produced by combining all groups assessed in this study. The usefulness of this trait is enhanced by the survivability of the mandible and the fact that preliminary investigations show that the trait is clearly evident in fossil hominids. Susan R.

40|$|The {{rapid rise}} and {{diversification}} of the angiosperms has puzzled biologists for centuries; processes leading to current angiosperm diversity remain {{a key question}} in evolutionary biology, with particular focus on the morphological diversity of flowers. The Zingiberales are an order of tropical monocots that represent an ideal group of plants to study the evolution of floral morphology. The order contains approximately 2, 500 species, many of which form specialized pollination relationships with bees, birds, bats, dung beetles, moths, butterflies, and primates (lemurs) via alterations in floral form. After developing a technique for visualizing and then studying gene expression in floral apices, I investigated the role of two candidate gene families, the GLOBOSA (GLO) -like genes and the CYCLOIDEA/ TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1 (CYC/TB 1) -like genes, {{in the evolution of}} floral morphology in the Zingiberales. Evolutionary developmental biology often combines methods for examining morphology (e. g. Scanning Electron Microscopy) with analyses of gene expression (e. g. RNA in situ hybridization). Due to differences in tissue preparation for SEM and gene expression analyses, the same specimen cannot be used for both sets of techniques. I developed a method that couples extended-depth-of-field (EDF) epi-illumination microscopy to in situ hybridization in a sequential format, enabling both surface microscopy and gene expression analyses to be carried out on the same specimen (Chapter 1). I first created a digital image of inflorescence apices using epi-illumination microscopy and commercially available EDF software. I then performed RNA in situ hybridizations on photographed apices to assess expression of two developmental genes: Knotted 1 (Kn 1) in Zea mays (Poaceae) and a GLO homolog in Musa basjoo (Musaceae). I demonstrate that expression signal is neither altered nor reduced in the imaged apices as compared with unphotographed controls. The demonstrated method reduces the amount of sample material necessary for developmental research and enables individual floral development to be placed {{in the context of the}} entire inflorescence. While the technique presented is particularly relevant to floral developmental biology, it is applicable to any research where observation and description of external features can be fruitfully linked with analyses of gene expression. The MADS box transcription factor family has long been identified as an important contributor to the control of floral development. It is often hypothesized that the evolution of floral development across angiosperms and within specific lineages may occur as a result of duplication, functional diversification, and changes in regulation of MADS box genes. In Chapter 2 I examine the role of GLO -like genes, members of the B-class MADS box gene lineage, in the evolution of floral development within the monocot order Zingiberales. I assessed changes in perianth and stamen whorl morphology in a phylogenetic framework. I identified GLO homologs from 50 Zingiberales species and investigated the evolution of this gene lineage. Expression of two GLO homologs was assessed in Costus spicatus Swartz (Costaceae) and Musa basjoo Siebold (Musaceae). Based on the phylogenetic data and expression results, I propose several family-specific losses and gains of GLO homologs that appear to be associated with key morphological changes. The GLO -like gene lineage has diversified concomitant with the evolution of the dimorphic perianth and the staminodial labellum. Duplications and expression divergence within the GLO -like gene lineage may have played a role in floral diversification in the Zingiberales. In the Zingiberales, evolutionary shifts in symmetry occur in all floral whorls, making this an ideal group of plants in which to study the evolution of this important ecological and <b>developmental</b> <b>trait.</b> The CYC/TB 1 -like genes have been implicated in the development and evolution of floral symmetry in divergent angiosperm lineages, and I thus chose them as a candidate gene family to investigate their role in the evolution of floral symmetry within the Zingiberales (Chapter 3). I identified both Zingiberales-specific gene duplications and a duplication in the TB 1 -like (TBL) lineage that predates the divergence of the commelinid monocots. I examined the expression of two TBL genes in Costus spicatus (Costaceae) and Heliconia stricta (Heliconiaceae), two Zingiberales taxa with divergent floral symmetries. I found that TBL gene expression shifts concomitant with shifts in floral symmetry. Through this body of work we have gained some insight into the mechanics of angiosperm evolution. Duplications in the GLO -like gene lineage in the Zingiberales may have allowed for gene sub- or neofunctionalization and the evolution of new morphologies; in particular, the evolution of differentiated sepals and petals and of the staminodial labellum. In addition, this study adds to the growing body of evidence that CYC/TB 1 -like genes have been repeatedly recruited through the course of evolution to generate bilateral floral symmetry (zygomorphy). Although this work certainly doesn't preclude the involvement of as yet uncharacterized genes and gene families, it adds to the growing body of evidence that angiosperms as a group do indeed have a genetic `toolkit': a core set of genes that have been variously deployed through evolutionary time to generate both convergent and divergent floral morphologies...|$|E
40|$|A central {{problem in}} {{evolutionary}} physiology {{is to understand}} the relationship between energy metabolism and fitness-related traits. Most attempts to do so have been based on phenotypic correlations that are not informative for the evolutionary potential of natural populations. Here, we explored the effect of contrasting ethanol environments on physiological and <b>developmental</b> <b>traits,</b> their genetic (co) variances and genetic architecture in Drosophila melanogaster. Phenotypic and genetic parameters were estimated in two populations (San Fernando and Valdivia, Chile), using a half-sib family design where broods were split into ethanol-free and ethanol-supplemented conditions. Our findings show that metabolic rate, body mass and development times were sensitive (i. e., phenotypic plasticity) to ethanol conditions and dependent on population origin. Significant heritabilities were found for all traits, while significant genetic correlations were only found between larval and total development time and between development time and metabolic rate for flies of the San Fernando population developed in ethanol-free conditions. Posterior analyses indicated that the G matrices differed between ethanol conditions for the San Fernando population (mainly explained by differences in genetic (co) variances of <b>developmental</b> <b>traits),</b> whereas the Valdivia population exhibited similar G matrices between ethanol conditions. Our findings suggest that ethanol-free environment increases the energy available to reduce development time. Therefore, our results indicate that environmental ethanol could modify the process of energy allocation, which could have consequence...|$|R
40|$|In Arabidopsis {{recombinant}} {{inbred line}} (RIL) populations {{are widely used}} for quantitative trait locus (QTL) analyses. However, mapping analyses {{with this type of}} population can be limited because of the masking effects of major QTL and epistatic interactions of multiple QTL. An alternative type of immortal experimental population commonly used in plant species are sets of introgression lines. Here we introduce the development of a genomewide coverage near-isogenic line (NIL) population of Arabidopsis thaliana, by introgressing genomic regions from the Cape Verde Islands (Cvi) accession into the Landsberg erecta (Ler) genetic background. We have empirically compared the QTL mapping power of this new population with an already existing RIL population derived from the same parents. For that, we analyzed and mapped QTL affecting six <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> with different heritability. Overall, in the NIL population smaller-effect QTL than in the RIL population could be detected although the localization resolution was lower. Furthermore, we estimated the effect of population size and of the number of replicates on the detection power of QTL affecting the <b>developmental</b> <b>traits.</b> In general, population size {{is more important than the}} number of replicates to increase the mapping power of RILs, whereas for NILs several replicates are absolutely required. These analyses are expected to facilitate experimental design for QTL mapping using these two common types of segregating populations...|$|R

40|$|We {{performed}} a tree-based analysis of trilobite postembryonic {{development in a}} sample of 60 species for which quantitative data on segmentation and growth increments between putative successive instars are available, and that spans much of the temporal, phylogenetic, and habitat range of the group. Three <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> were investigated: the developmental mode of trunk segmentation, the average per-molt growth rate, and the conformity to a constant per-molt growth rate (Dyar’s rule), for which an original metric was devised. Growth rates are within the normal range with respect to other arthropods and show overall conformity to Dyar’s rule. Randomization tests indicate statistically significant phylogenetic signal for growth in early juveniles but not in later stages. Among five evolutionary models fit via maximum likelihood, one in which growth rates vary independently among species, analogous to Brownian motion on a star phylogeny, is the best supported in all ontogenetic stages, although a model with a single, stationary peak to which growth rates are attracted also garners nontrivial support. These results are not consistent with unbounded, Brownian-motion-like evolutionary dynamics, but instead suggest the influence of an adaptive zone. Our results suggest that <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> in trilobites were relatively labile during evolutionary history. KEY WORDS: Evolutionary trends, fossil arthropods, growth, molt cycle, ontogeny, phylogenetic signal. Ontogenetic series of extinct species add to the knowledge of developmental diversity derived from studies of living organ-isms, and can provide evidence for the phylogenetically basal developmental character states of major clades. They serve a critical role in defining the polarity of evolutionary change in development by revealing how ontogeny has itself evolve...|$|R
40|$|Many {{environmental}} factors, biotic and abiotic interact {{to influence}} organismal development. Given {{the importance of}} Aedes aegypti as a vector of human pathogens including dengue and yellow fever, understanding the impact of environmental factors such as temperature, resource availability, and intraspecific competition during development is critical for population control purposes. Despite known associations between <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> and factors of diet and density, temperature has been considered the primary driver of development rate and survival. To determine {{the relative importance of}} these critical factors, wide gradients of conditions must be considered. We hypothesize that 1) diet and density, as well as temperature influence the variation in development rate and survival, 2) that these factors interact, and this interaction is also necessary to understand variation in <b>developmental</b> <b>traits.</b> Temperature, diet, density, and their two-way interactions are significant factors in explaining development rate variation of the larval stages of Ae. aegypti mosquitoes. These factors as well as two and three-way interactions are significantly associated with the development rate from hatch to emergence. Temperature, but not diet or density, significantly impacted juvenile mortality. Development time was heteroskedastic with the highest variation occurring at the extremes of diet and density conditions. All three factors significantly impacted survival curves of experimental larvae that died during development. Complex interactions may contribute to variation in development rate. To better predict variation in development rate and survival in Ae. aegypti, factors of resource availability and intraspecific density must be considered in addition, but never to the exclusion of temperature...|$|R
40|$|Almost all genetic {{risk factors}} for autism {{spectrum}} disorders (ASDs) {{can be found in}} the general population, but the effects of that risk are unclear in people not ascertained for neuropsychiatric symptoms. Using several large ASD consortia and population based resources, we find genetic links between ASDs and typical variation in social behavior and adaptive functioning. This finding is evidenced through both inherited and de novo variation, indicating that multiple types of genetic risk for ASDs influence a continuum of behavioral and <b>developmental</b> <b>traits,</b> the severe tail of which can result in an ASD or other neuropsychiatric disorder diagnosis. A continuum model should inform the design and interpretation of studies of neuropsychiatric disease biology...|$|R

Through numerous studies, these factors are shown to indicate quality care and to predict improved outcomes for children. However, {{it is important to}} note that, although the indicators of high quality child care mentioned here are predictive of positive outcomes for children, these effects cannot be assumed to be causal. Therefore, the following indicators should be considered as general recommendations coming from the most recent and relevant studies on what elements contribute to quality child care and child development. Quality child care has been repeatedly linked to positive <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> in children, including cognitive, social, and emotional development, and...|$|R

Surprisingly, {{little is known about the}} genetic basis for the differences in barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) leaf development. The two barley row-type classes, i. e., two- and six-rowed, show clear-cut differences in leaf development. To quantify these differences and to measure the genetic component of the phenotypic variance for the leaf developmental differences in both row-type classes we investigated 32 representative spring barley accessions (14 two- and 18 six-rowed accessions) under three independent growth conditions. Leaf mass area is lower in plants grown under greenhouse (GH) conditions due to fewer, smaller, and lighter leaf blades per main culm compared to pot- and soil-grown field plants. Larger and heavier leaf blades of six-rowed barley correlate with higher main culm spike grain yield, spike dry weight, and harvest index; however, smaller leaf area (LA) in two-rowed barley can be attributed to more spikes, tillers, and biological yield (aboveground parts). In general, leaf growth rate was significantly higher between awn primordium and tipping stages. Moderate to very high broad-sense heritabilities (0. 67 – 0. 90) were found under all growth conditions, indicating that these traits are predominantly genetically controlled. In addition, our data suggests that GH conditions are suitable for studying leaf <b>developmental</b> <b>traits.</b> Our results also demonstrated that LA impacts single plant yield and can be reconsidered in future breeding programs. Six-rowed spike 1 (Vrs 1) is the major determinate of barley row-types, the differences in leaf development between two- and six-rowed barleys may be attributed to the regulation of Vrs 1 in these two classes, which needs further testing...|$|R

Genome-wide association (GWA) analyses in humans have implied many genes in the control of height but suffer from the inability to control the environment. Genetic analyses in Drosophila have identified conserved signaling pathways controlling size; however, how these pathways control phenotypic diversity is unclear. We performed GWA of size traits using the Drosophila Genetic Reference Panel of inbred, sequenced lines. We find that the top associated variants differ between traits and sexes; do not map to canonical growth pathway genes, but {{can be linked to}} these by epistasis analysis; and are enriched for genes and putative enhancers. Performing GWA on well-studied <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> under controlled conditions expands our understanding of developmental processes underlying phenotypic diversity...|$|R

Signalling coupled by the heterotrimeric G protein complex underlies various developmental pathways in plants. The morphology of two plastic developmental pathways, root system architecture and female inflorescence formation, was quantitatively assessed in a mutant compact plant 2 (ct 2) lacking the alpha subunit of the heterotrimeric G protein complex in maize. The ct 2 mutant partially compensated for a reduced shoot height by increased total leaf number, and had far more ears, even {{in the presence of}} pollination signals. The maize heterotrimeric G protein complex is important in some plastic <b>developmental</b> <b>traits</b> in maize. In particular, the maize Galpha subunit is required to dampen the overproduction of female inflorescences...|$|R
