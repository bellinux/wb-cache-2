This makes Public <b>Nursery</b> <b>Schools</b> (PNS) receive greater attention as places to remedy to decline of family and community based support.

Steady provision of funding level ensures that PNS improve wellbeing and learning outcomes of children through whole school interventions. By contrast, deprivation of interventions {{during the early years}} results in lifelong deficiencies and disadvantages.

The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> is located in Mabibo Ward in Kinondoni Municipality, Dar es Salaam - Tanzania. Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> started in 1996 and provides preschool education to approximately 60 children per year. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> is private and is run by three teachers. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> provides education to 3 - 6 years olds from Matokeo, Kanuni, Azimio and Jitegemee Sub-Wards. Parents of children attending/attended Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> participated in a survey to collect community members' feelings and opinions about the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School.</b> Results of the survey reveal that the status and learning environment of the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> is poor. The <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> cannot maintain the required standards due to inadequate capital. The fees rate per month is TZS 3000. A monthly collection is not enough to pay for salaries and other operational fees and savings. The low level of the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> does not provide ground for raising the fee rate. The Community {{would like to see the}} status and learning environment of Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> improved. Successful completion of this project is anticipated to improve the status and learning environment of Ngaraba <b>Nursery</b> <b>School.</b> With improved learning environment the <b>Nursery</b> <b>School</b> can raise the fees rate and hence collect enough money to cater for the costs of maintaining the required high preschool standards.
