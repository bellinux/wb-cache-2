5000|$|By early 1897, {{with the}} GPA venture in debt, {{conservation}} {{interests in the}} state sought to protect the mountain through other means. Legislation was filed by William H. Chase, editor of the Berkshire Sunday Democrat of North Adams, {{under the auspices of}} the Board of Trade of North Adams to transfer the GPA land holdings on the mountain to the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for a state reservation. This included supporting testimony from Williams College geology professor T. Nelson Dale, and a $25,000 appropriation bill filed through Judge Arthur M. Robinson. Additional support came from the Massachusetts Forestry Association's initiative to advocate for the establishment of a state park system, and to make the case point, fight inappropriate development of the state's highest peak, Mount Greylock. The principal argument for making the mountain a public reservation was to protect the Hoosic and Housatonic River watersheds from erosion due to recent trends of deforestation (particularly noted on the Adams side). Another concern was to preserve it for the public rather than private and exclusive enjoyment. On June 20, 1898 Mount Greylock State Reservation was created, with the stipulation that the state add to the original land (to ultimately total 10000 acre). With this acquisition the first public land in Massachusetts for the purpose of forest preservation was created, later to become the state park system. A three-person, governor-appointed Greylock Reservation Commission, a body of Berkshire County government, was entrusted with the care and maintenance of the reservation. The title [...] "Reservation" [...] refers to county management of state land, since there was only one state forester and a handful of state <b>fire</b> <b>wardens</b> in <b>service</b> at the time; similarly other early State Reservation properties in Massachusetts were previously managed and operated by county commissions for the state.|$|R

50|$|In certain jurisdictions, civilians can get {{certified}} to be a <b>Fire</b> <b>Warden,</b> and some cities require {{certain types of}} buildings, such as high rises, {{to have a certain}} number of <b>Fire</b> <b>Wardens.</b> For example, the City of Houston, Texas, requires every tenant in a high-rise to have at least one <b>Fire</b> <b>Warden</b> for every 7500 sq. ft. occupied, and a minimum of two <b>Fire</b> <b>Wardens</b> per floor. In this example, their duties include investigating any fire alarms (see if there really is a fire and if so, its nature), ensuring the fire department is contacted, directing the evacuation of the facility, activating or delaying activation of fire suppression equipment such as halon and sprinklers (delayed in case of a false alarm), meeting the fire department and taking them to the location of the alarm or to the fire past any security or locked doors, and, if necessary, fighting the fire until the fire department arrives.|$|R
