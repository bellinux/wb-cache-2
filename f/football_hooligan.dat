5|$|Rise of the Footsoldier (2007) – The {{rise of a}} <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> is chronicled {{from his}} {{beginnings}} on the terraces to becoming {{a member of a}} notorious gang of criminals. The rivalry between West Ham and Millwall is portrayed during the opening scenes of the film.|$|E
5|$|Twenty {{minutes into}} the game, a pass to the right wing by George Livingstone eluded Bolton's Archie Freebairn, and reached Meredith, who dribbled beyond Bob Struthers for a run on goal. He shot to goalkeeper Davies' left, scoring the opening goal. Reporters with Bolton sympathies, such as ex-Bolton {{secretary}} JJ Bentley, claimed the goal to be offside, though the Bolton players made no appeal to the referee. The goal led to one over-exuberant Manchester City supporter invading the pitch, and subsequently being escorted away by police, though {{in contrast to the}} modern image of the <b>football</b> <b>hooligan,</b> the Sporting Chronicle reported that the man was then allowed back onto the terraces, as the police had been impressed by the level of devotion that he had demonstrated.|$|E
25|$|Acid {{house was}} also popular in Manchester. The Thunderdome (which was {{generally}} advertised as a Techno night) in Miles Platting {{was at the}} epicenter of the scene and gave rise to acts like 808 State, Jam MC's, Steve Williams and Jay Wearden. The genre was extremely popular with the city's football hooligans. According to Manchester United <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of a Little Red Devil, the acid house venues were the only place where rival hooligan gangs would mix without coming to blows with one another.|$|E

50|$|According to Colin Blaney in Hotshot: The Story of a Little Red Devil, many of Manchester United's <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> {{turned to}} serious crime during this period. He states that {{roughly half of}} the team's hooligans became {{involved}} in selling class A drugs, {{partly because of the}} wave of drugs that came with early 1990s rave culture, a scene that <b>football</b> <b>hooligans</b> were at the centre of.|$|R
25|$|Another major {{adaptation}} {{was staged}} in 1987 by the English Shakespeare Company, {{under the direction}} of Michael Bogdanov. This touring production opened at the Old Vic, and subsequently toured for two years, performing at, amongst other places, the Panasonic Globe Theatre in Tokyo, Japan (as the inaugural play of the arena), the Festival dei Due Mondi in Spoleto, Italy and at the Adelaide Festival in Adelaide, Australia. Following the structure established by Barton and Hall, Bogdanov combined a heavily edited 1 Henry VI and the first half of 2 Henry VI into one play (Henry VI), and the second half of 2 Henry VI and 3 Henry VI into another (Edward IV), and followed them with an edited Richard III. Also like Barton and Hall, Bogdanov concentrated on political issues, although he made them far more overt than had his predecessors. For example, played by June Watson, Margaret was closely modelled after the British Prime Minister at the time, Margaret Thatcher, {{even to the point of}} having similar clothes and hair. Likewise, Paul Brennan's Henry was closely modelled after King Edward VIII, before his abdication. Jack Cade, played by Michael Pennington was presented as a punk with spiked hair and wearing a shirt depicting a Union Jack with a white rose in the middle, and during the Cade rebellion, <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> chants were heard. Indeed, the Cade rebellion in general was modelled on the National Front. Bogdanov also employed frequent anachronisms and contemporary visual registers, in an effort to show the relevance of the politics to the contemporary period. The production was noted for its pessimism as regards contemporary British politics, with some critics feeling the political resonances were too heavy handed. However, the series was a huge box office success. Alongside Watson and Brennen, the play starred Barry Stanton as York and Colin Farrell as Gloucester.|$|E

[...] Anita Neal, 100m olympic sprinter, lived in the town and went to John Lea School England Rugby captain Bob Taylor and player Jeff Butterfield both taught at Wellingborough Grammar School. Infamous <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> colloquially known as the Pig of Marseille is also from the town.|$|E
500|$|Peggy Gallagher {{acquired}} a legal notice of separation {{from her husband}} in 1976. Six years later, she finally left him, taking the three boys with her. As teenagers, the Gallagher brothers (especially Noel) were regular truants, often getting into trouble with the police. When his mother took a job working in the school canteen, Gallagher ensured that he stopped by to visit her during lunch before skipping {{the rest of the}} day. He was expelled from school at the age of 15 for throwing a bag of flour over a teacher. He used to hang around with the <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> firms Maine Line Crew, Under-5s, and Young Guvnors in the 1980s, and at the age of 13, he received six months' probation for robbing a corner shop. It was during this period of probation, with little else to do, that he first began to teach himself to play a guitar his father had left him, playing his favourite songs from the radio. Gallagher was particularly inspired by the debut of The Smiths on Top of the Pops in 1983, performing their single [...] "This Charming Man". He later reflected that [...] "from that day on ... wanted to be Johnny Marr". He also appeared (and scored) for Manchester Gaelic football outfit CLG Oisín at Croke Park, Dublin in 1983.|$|E

500|$|The {{rivalry between}} the teams, {{specifically}} the clubs' two hooligan firms has been depicted {{on the big}} screen several times. In 1989 Alan Clarke directed The Firm, starring real-life Millwall supporter Gary Oldman. He plays Bex, leader of the football firm the Inter City Crew, a fictional representation of West Ham's Inter City Firm and their violent exploits. In it Millwall's Bushwackers firm are depicted as The Buccaneers. Green Street was released in 2004, with real-life Hammers supporter Elijah Wood playing an American student who gets involved with West Ham's firm. The film builds up to the big clash with Millwall's firm at the climax, after the two teams draw each other in the Cup, foreshadowing the reality of the League Cup game which led to the 2009 Upton Park riot. It was a moderate financial success, grossing just over $3 million worldwide. The rise of a <b>football</b> <b>hooligan,</b> Carlton Leach, is chronicled in 2007's Rise of the Footsoldier, from his beginnings on the terraces to becoming a member of a notorious gang of criminals. The bitter rivalry between the Hammers and the Lions is displayed, by the use of original footage, during the opening scenes of the film. In 2009 a direct-to-video sequel to Green Street was made, [...] It follows on directly from the original's climax, with several members of West Ham's and Millwall's firms ending up in prison together and arranging a football match. A remake of The Firm, also titled The Firm was released in 2009 by Nick Love, director of The Football Factory and himself a Millwall supporter. Set in the 1980s, the film highlights the music, fashion and culture surrounding football at the time. It was generally well received by critics. In October 2009, the Metropolitan Police released still photos from the film in relation to a search for hooligans from the Upton Park riot. The mistake led to an apology from Scotland Yard. The 2012 zombie comedy Cockneys vs Zombies referenced the rivalry, showing Millwall and West Ham zombies fighting amongst themselves in East London after a zombie apocalypse. In 2013 a third film in the Green Street franchise, [...] was released. It focuses on a rivalry between West Ham and Millwall fans within mixed martial arts.|$|E

2500|$|In November 2007, the BBC {{soap opera}} EastEnders caused {{controversy}} when the character Minty Peterson (played by Cliff Parisi) made {{a reference to}} the disaster. During the episode car mechanic Minty said: [...] "Five years out of Europe because of Heysel, because they penned you lot in to stop you fighting on the pitch and then what did we end up with? Hillsborough." [...] This prompted 380 complaints and the BBC apologised, saying that the character was simply reminding another character, former <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> Jase Dyer, that the actions of hooligans led to the fencing-in of football fans. Ofcom also received 177 complaints.|$|E
2500|$|Stoke {{have had}} {{problems}} in the past with football hooliganism in the 1970s, '80s, '90s and early 2000s which gave the club a bad reputation, this was to the actions by the [...] "Naughty Forty" [...] firm which associated itself with the club and was formed by supporter Mark Chester. Mark Chester reformed himself and {{now works as a}} youth inclusion promoter. In 2003, the BBC described Stoke City as having [...] "one of the most active and organised <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> firms in England". In response to these criticisms, the club introduced an Away Travel ID scheme. This was subsequently suspended in 2008 as a result of improved behaviour and an enhanced reputation. More recently, Stoke City's fans and their stadium have been perceived as loud, friendly, passionate and modern, welcoming as guests Sugar Ray Leonard and Diego Maradona. There is in the media now [...] "genuine admiration for the volume and volatility of the club's loyal support". Stoke announced that they will offer supporters free bus travel to every Premier League away game in the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons.|$|E

In 1989, Oldman also starred as <b>football</b> <b>hooligan</b> Clive [...] "Bex" [...] Bissel in British drama The Firm, {{a performance}} which Total Film numbered as his best and called [...] "stunning" [...] and [...] "fearless" [...] in 2011. In 1990 he costarred with Tim Roth in Rosencrantz & Guildenstern Are Dead, Tom Stoppard's film adaptation {{of his own}} play of the same name. Total Film also praised the movie, calling Oldman's character [...] "a blitz of brilliant comedy timing and pitch perfect line delivery." [...] Oldman starred opposite Sean Penn and Ed Harris in State of Grace (1990), his first prominent US film; Roger Ebert described Oldman's turn as the highlight. Janet Maslin, another noted US film critic, referred to his work as [...] "phenomenal". He was offered, but turned down, the lead role in that year's Edward Scissorhands. Oldman moved to the United States in the early 1990s, where he has resided since. Oldman and other young British actors of the 1980s who were becoming established Hollywood film actors, such as Tim Roth, Bruce Payne, Colin Firth, Daniel Day-Lewis and Paul McGann, were dubbed the [...] "Brit Pack", of which Oldman was de facto leader.|$|E
