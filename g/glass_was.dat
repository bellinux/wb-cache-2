5|$|A sequel, titled Alice Through the Looking <b>Glass,</b> <b>was</b> {{released}} on May 27, 2016.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> then {{recalled}} by the Rangers on December 14 after Jarret Stoll was waived.|$|E
5|$|At its peak, Duncan & Miller's <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> one of Washington's most {{successful}} manufacturing concerns, and was more widely known throughout the county {{than any other}} line of goods made in Washington.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass</b> {{cookware}} <b>is</b> {{another common}} usage. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> used for measuring cups, featuring screen printed markings providing graduated measurements. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> sometimes used for high-quality beverage glassware. Borosilicate <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> thin and durable, microwave- and dishwasher-safe.|$|R
50|$|Cased <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{a type of}} <b>glass.</b> It <b>is</b> {{similar to}} flashed glass however, cased <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made with thicker glass layers.|$|R
2500|$|Drinking glasses have {{colorful}} {{names and}} can reflect a customer's ability to drink pulque. Large two-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> called macetas (flower pots), one-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> called cañones (cannons), half–liters are called [...] chivitos (little goats), quarter-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> catrinas (dandies), and eighth-liter <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> tornillos (screws). Traditionally, these <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> {{made from a}} greenish, hand blown <b>glass.</b> Pulque can <b>be</b> drunk straight from the barrel or can {{have a number of}} additives, such as fruit or nuts, added. Pulque prepared this way is called curado or cured.|$|R
5|$|During the {{restoration}} led by Street, {{most of the}} work on the <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> by Hardman & Co.; these include the rose window and towers at the west end and the Magnificat in the Elder Lady Chapel.|$|E
5|$|Glass underwhelmed in 2014-15, with 6 {{points in}} 66 games, {{and after a}} poor start to the 2015-16 season, <b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> put on waivers and {{assigned}} to the Hartford Wolf Pack.|$|E
5|$|Hebron <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> {{traditionally}} produced using {{sand from}} the village of Bani Na'im, east of Hebron, and sodium carbonate taken from the Dead Sea. Instead of sand, recycled glass is the primary raw material used to make Hebron glass today.|$|E
50|$|Satin <b>glass</b> can <b>be</b> {{used for}} {{decorative}} items. However, satin <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{also used to}} provide privacy where the full transparency of <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> undesirable.|$|R
40|$|Purpose of {{my thesis}} is to apprasial {{of quality of}} flat glass. Firstly the <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> introduced, next glass-making, {{characteristics}} and kinds of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> mentioned. Next implementing legislation and disagreements of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> desribed. The most frequent disagreemets are explored. In this part quality control tools are applied, Pareto a Ishikawa diagram. Finally the quality of flat <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> evaluated...|$|R
50|$|Smoked <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> held in {{the smoke}} of a candle flame (or other inefficiently burning hydrocarbon) such that one surface of the sheet of <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> covered in a layer of smoke residue. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> then used as a medium for {{recording}} pen traces in scientific instruments.|$|R
5|$|During {{the period}} of the Commonwealth, 1649–60, {{wholesale}} iconoclasm was wrought on all the pictorial elements of Christian buildings. Most of England’s medieval stained <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> smashed. The majority of England’s medieval statues were smashed or defaced leaving only a few isolated examples intact. Medieval paintings almost disappeared. Vestments embroidered in the famous style known as Opus Anglicanum were burnt. Those medieval Communion vessels that had escaped the Dissolution were melted down so that only about 50 items of pre-Reformation church plate remain.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> born in Regina, Saskatchewan, to Fred and Cathy Glass. He has a brother, Darnell, and a sister, Shayna. Growing up {{in nearby}} Craven, Saskatchewan, he {{graduated}} from Lumsden High School. An honour roll student, Glass also played on several athletic high school teams. He won provincial championships in baseball and hockey, as well bronze medals in the 200 metre and 4x100 metre relay track events. In July 2011, Glass married Emily Tracy in Seattle, Washington; the couple has two sons.|$|E
5|$|In 1899, Hartford City <b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> {{acquired}} by the American Window Glass Company, which controlled 85 percent of the American window glass manufacturing capacity. During the next decade, the company began replacing its skilled and well–paid Belgian glass blowers with machines and less-skilled machine operators. The company used the Hartford City plant to test and refine the new technology. Most of the Belgian glass workers left town.|$|E
50|$|Architectural <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that <b>is</b> {{used as a}} {{building}} material. It is most typically used as transparent glazing material in the building envelope, including windows in the external walls. <b>Glass</b> <b>is</b> also used for internal partitions and as an architectural feature. When used in buildings, <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> often of a safety type, which include reinforced, toughened and laminated glasses.|$|R
50|$|Annealed <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> without {{internal}} stresses caused by heat treatment, i.e., rapid cooling, or by toughening or heat strengthening. Glass becomes annealed {{if it is}} heated above a transition point then allowed to cool slowly, without being quenched. Float <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> annealed {{during the process of}} manufacture. However, most toughened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made from float <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> specially heat-treated.|$|R
50|$|As a {{material}} stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> <b>glass</b> that has <b>been</b> coloured by adding metallic salts during its manufacture. The coloured <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> crafted into {{stained glass windows}} in which small pieces of <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> arranged to form patterns or pictures, held together (traditionally) by strips of lead and supported by a rigid frame. Painted details and yellow stain are often used to enhance the design. The term stained <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> also applied to windows in which the colours have been painted onto the glass and then fused to the glass in a kiln.|$|R
5|$|In Gilroy and Hollister, sixteen {{people were}} injured, and damage totaled $500,000. Chimneys fell (especially on older {{homes in the}} {{downtown}} area of Gilroy) and <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> broken, but in Gilroy structural damage afflicted five buildings. A wall was cracked at city hall, and a court room ceiling collapsed. Damaged structural components at a Ford's Department Store forced its closure. In Hollister, a J. C. Penney had a hole and cracks in its ceiling and a parapet collapsed at a law office. At Casa de Fruta, a service station sustained structural damage, as did a fire station at Pacheco Pass.|$|E
5|$|Little of {{the early}} stained glass remains. In the west window of St John's Chapel, for instance, the medieval glass barely survived the {{destruction}} (said to {{have been caused by}} Oliver Cromwell's men). Most of the higher portions went untouched, but others were severely damaged. In some cases the windows were impossible to repair, and clear <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> eventually introduced to replace the missing scenes. The Victorian stained-glass windows were created by some of the finest studios of that period.|$|E
5|$|Shulgin began {{studying}} organic chemistry as a Harvard University scholarship {{student at the}} age of 16. In 1943 he dropped out of school to join the U.S. Navy. While serving on USS Pope in the Navy during World War II, Shulgin was given a glass of orange juice by a nurse prior to surgery for a thumb infection. Shulgin drank the juice and, assuming that the powder {{at the bottom of the}} <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> a sedative, fell asleep rapidly. Upon waking he learned that the powder was undissolved sugar. The experience made him aware of the influence of placebos over the human mind.|$|E
5000|$|Low-dispersion <b>glass</b> (LD <b>glass)</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} with low dispersion. Crown <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{an example of a}} {{relatively}} inexpensive low-dispersion glass.|$|R
50|$|<b>Glass</b> floors <b>are</b> {{made with}} {{transparent}} <b>glass</b> when it <b>is</b> useful to view something from above or below; whereas translucent <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> used {{when there is}} no need to view through. In either case, toughened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> usually chosen, for its durability and resistance to breakage.|$|R
50|$|Chemically {{strengthened}} <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> a type {{of glass}} that has increased strength. When broken it still shatters in long pointed splinters similar to float (annealed) glass. For this reason, it is not considered a safety <b>glass</b> and must <b>be</b> laminated if a safety <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> required. Chemically strengthened <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> typically six to eight times the strength of annealed glass.|$|R
5|$|St Edern's Church, Bodedern (sometimes {{referred}} to as St Ederyn's Church) is a medieval parish church {{in the village of}} Bodedern, in Anglesey, north Wales. Although St Edern established a church in the area in the 6th century, the oldest parts of the present building date from the 14th century. Subsequent alterations include the addition of some windows in the 15th century, and a chancel, transept and porch in the 19th century, when the nave walls were largely rebuilt. Stained <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> also inserted into the windows of the chancel and transept.|$|E
5|$|Traditionally, the <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> melted using local raw materials, {{including}} {{sand from}} neighbouring villages, sodium carbonate (from the Dead Sea), and coloring additives such as iron oxide and copper oxide. Nowadays, recycled glass {{is often used}} instead. Glass production in Hebron is a family trade, the secrets {{of which have been}} preserved and passed down by a few Palestinian families who operate the glass factories located just outside the city. The products made include glass jewellery, such as beads, bracelets, and rings, as well as stained glass windows, and glass lamps. However, due to the Palestinian-Israeli conflict, glass production has suffered a decline.|$|E
5|$|It is {{possible}} that a church was present on the site in the Saxon era, although the earliest fabric in the church is Norman. The present ground plan {{was established in the}} 13th and 14thcenturies, from which time the church's external appearance dates, apart from a major rebuilding in the later part of the 15thcentury, when the range of high windows or clerestory was added. All styles of English Gothic architecture, are represented in the church: Early English, Decorated, and Perpendicular. During the civil war, a group of Roundheads stabled their horses in the church. In the 19thcentury the interior of the church was restored by George Gilbert Scott; some wall paintings were revealed, and stained <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> added.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most popular}} <b>glass</b> for {{lampworking}} <b>is</b> soda-lime <b>glass,</b> which <b>is</b> available pre-colored. Soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> the traditional mix used in blown furnace glass, and lampworking <b>glass</b> rods <b>were</b> originally hand-drawn from the furnace {{and allowed to}} cool for use by lampworkers. Today soda-lime, or [...] "soft" [...] <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> manufactured globally, including Italy, Germany, Czech Republic, China and America.|$|R
40|$|The {{physical}} and thermal properties Of P 2 O 5 -Al 2 O 3 -BaO-La 2 O 3 <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> investigated. The effects of glass compositions on the transition temperature, thermal expansion coefficient, density, hardness and refractive index of <b>glasses</b> <b>were</b> studied. The highest hardness of the <b>glasses</b> <b>is</b> 4143. 891 MPa {{and the lowest}} thermal expansion coefficient of the <b>glasses</b> <b>is</b> 71. 770 x 10 (- 7) /&DEG; C. A phosphate glass with high mechanical strength and good thermal characteristic is obtained...|$|R
30|$|The {{translucent}} glass vessels {{of this study}} are consistent with and typical of 1 st millennium BCE Hellenistic production in the eastern Mediterranean region. Vessel form, style, manufacture method and colour are independent of reduced <b>glass</b> composition. <b>Glasses</b> <b>are</b> decoloured with manganese, which also produced one purple <b>glass.</b> Blue <b>is</b> produced in one sample by cobalt with a little copper, and one green and one blue <b>glass</b> <b>are</b> coloured by copper. Other bluish and green <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> the result of iron contamination in the batch. Amber <b>glasses</b> <b>are</b> likely the result of the presence of iron and sulphur in a ferri-sulphide complex.|$|R
5|$|Until {{suffering}} an upper-body injury {{during practice}} in early March 2011, <b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> the lone staple on the Canucks' fourth line, {{playing with a}} rotation of wingers and centres. Glass missed nine games with the injury, returning in early April. He finished the regular season with 3 goals and 10 points over 73 games, helping the Canucks win the Presidents' Trophy as {{the team with the}} league's best record. With the top seed in the Western Conference, the Canucks eliminated the Chicago Blackhawks, Nashville Predators and San Jose Sharks en route to the 2011 Stanley Cup Finals, where they lost in seven games to the Boston Bruins. Over 20 post-season games, Glass recorded no points and 18 penalty minutes.|$|E
5|$|Still {{unsigned}} by the Panthers {{at the end}} of {{his college}} career, Glass received an amateur tryout contract from Florida's American Hockey League (AHL) affiliate, the Rochester Americans, on March 21, 2007. He notched his first professional point, an assist, against the Syracuse Crunch four days later. Playing the final four games of the 2006–07 AHL season, he finished with one assist in his initial stint with the Americans. After signing his first NHL contract with the Panthers in August 2007, Glass split the 2007–08 season between Rochester and Florida. He began the campaign in the AHL, scoring his first professional goal against goaltender Jaroslav Halak in a game against the Hamilton Bulldogs on October 12, 2007. The following month, he received his first NHL call-up and earned just over a minute of ice time in his NHL debut against the Carolina Hurricanes, a 4–3 loss on November 12, 2007. After being sent back down within eight days, Glass earned two more call-ups over the course of the season. On January 22, 2008, he scored his first NHL goal against Ray Emery in a 5–3 win against the Ottawa Senators. Playing 41 games in his rookie NHL season, he notched a goal and an assist, while also recording 11 points in 43 AHL games. Beginning the 2008–09 season in the AHL for the second consecutive year, <b>Glass</b> <b>was</b> appointed as an alternate captain for the Americans. After appearing in 44 AHL games (4 goals and 13 points) and 3 NHL games (no points), he sustained a season-ending injury on February 7, 2009. Glass did not receive a qualifying offer from the Panthers for the following season.|$|E
5|$|The {{color of}} the shellac was matched to closets where the wood had not been darkened by {{exposure}} to light. The mosaic floors were recreated by Italian craftsmen {{at a cost of}} $50 per square foot ($538.12 per square meter). A local firm was found that could reproduce the complicated process of sandblasting and hide glue application used to create the original feather chipped glass. This reproduced <b>glass</b> <b>was</b> used to restore the partitions and naturally lit corridors of Root's design. To recreate the doors and wood trim, Donnell purchased the firm that had created the original oak woodwork—and still used the same 19th century machinery. Perfect replicas of the original aluminum light fixtures were fabricated from early photographs and carbon filament light bulbs were obtained to recreate the original lighting effect. A single surviving aluminum staircase was discovered behind a wall, restored, and used as a model to rebuild the lobby stairways and metalwork. The wainscoting on the upper floors was restored with marble salvaged from the recently modernized, nearby 19 LaSalle and Manhattan Buildings. Marble was purchased from the same Italian quarry that supplied Root's original construction to restore the lobby walls and ceilings.|$|E
50|$|The {{process of}} making Murano <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> rather complex. The <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> made from silica, which becomes liquid at high temperatures. As the glass passes from a liquid to a solid state, there is an {{interval}} when the <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> soft before it hardens completely. This is when the glass-master can shape the material.|$|R
50|$|Gold-band <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{a related}} Hellenistic and Roman technique, where strips of gold leaf, {{sandwiched}} between colourless <b>glass,</b> <b>are</b> used {{as part of}} the marbling effect in onyx <b>glass.</b> It <b>is</b> mostly found in small perfume bottles and the like.|$|R
50|$|Cathedral <b>glass</b> <b>is</b> {{the name}} given commercially to {{monochromatic}} sheet <b>glass.</b> It <b>is</b> thin {{by comparison with}} slab <b>glass,</b> may <b>be</b> coloured, and is textured on one side.|$|R
