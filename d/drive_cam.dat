50|$|The <b>drive</b> <b>cam</b> {{is driven}} by the camshaft. This pushes the rocker arm up and down about the {{trunnion}} pin or rocker shaft. Friction may be reduced at the point of contact with the valve stem by a roller tip. A similar arrangement transfers the motion via another roller tip to a second rocker arm. This rotates about the rocker shaft, and transfers the motion via a tappet to the poppet valve. In this case this opens the intake valve to the cylinder head.|$|E

[...] He would often <b>drive</b> <b>Cam</b> and Claire to their high school each morning, since he was old enough to obtain a driver's license. Cam commented in 2015 that his death {{was one of the first}} times she lost a person relatively close to her. When recording Untamed, she remembered the tragic events surrounding his death, which made her think of a village. In an interview with iHeartRadio she stated, [...] "It's just that your heart is made up and shaped by all these people that have loved you in your life, and that you have loved.

The kinematical model {{was set up}} by the method of coordinate transform for the robot in this paper, and the walking principle was analyzed when the robot moved in straight pipe and elbow. Further more the virtual prototype was made and kinematical {{simulation analysis}} had been accomplished. By the walking simulation when the robot moved in straight pipe and elbow it is validated that the walking principle established for the robot is correct. The robot can has bigger tensile draw. The worm pipe robot is evolvement from the classic Stewart parallel mechanism, but it is different from the classic Stewart parallel mechanism[1 - 3], refer to Fig 1. The robot composes upper platform, lower platform, support foot, auxiliary wheel, sphere hinge joint, linear driver and <b>drive</b> <b>cam.</b> It has 6 linear drivers and 2 <b>drive</b> <b>cam</b> installed on upper and lower platform.

5000|$|The 748 cc Mk.I VFR750 was {{introduced}} in 1985, and was over-engineered {{in a bid to}} re-establish a reputation for reliability. It had an alloy beam frame, gear <b>driven</b> <b>cams.</b> The Mk.IA changed wheel sizes from 16" [...] front & 18" [...] rear to 17" [...] front and rear, and the fairing was slightly modified. After this was a series of VFR750 models which featured various innovations, including a single-sided swingarm, linked braking, ABS, and VTEC. In due course the geared <b>cam</b> <b>drive</b> was dropped in favour of cheaper chain-drive.|$|R
50|$|Gear {{noise is}} one of the major {{drawbacks}} of using a geartrain to <b>drive</b> <b>cams.</b> In order to minimise this, Honda used a spring mounted scissor gear system (essentially 2 gears slightly offset) on the gear mounted on each camshaft, as well as the lowest mounted gear in each head (driven by the crankshaft), offsetting the teeth by roughly half of the pitch. This allowed the lash to be entirely taken up by the tension of the two teeth resting on the gear below, hence eliminating some of the noise and lash inherent in this type of system. The motor still makes a whirring noise which can be heard, as this is an intrinsic property of the straight cut type of gears which were used. The gear <b>driven</b> <b>cams</b> went on to be a key feature Honda used in their line of VFR750 motorcycles throughout the remainder of the 80's and throughout the 90's.|$|R

50|$|A {{mechanism}} is a device designed to transform input forces and movement into a desired set of output forces and movement.

50|$|The TLS motor {{featured}} a 90° V-twin for perfect primary balance and had hybrid chain/gear <b>driven</b> <b>cams.</b> A traditional cam chain turned a gear {{that in turn}} rotated the cams. This hybrid design eased maintenance immensely and gave the motor additional aural character because of the gear whine. The motor was also used for the Suzuki TL1000R. Suzuki also sold many of the TL motors to Cagiva {{to be used in}} the Navigator and V-Raptor models. Bimota also used the engine for their popular Bimota SB8K.|$|R
5000|$|Twin Independent Variable Camshaft Timing (Ti-VCT) is {{the name}} given by Ford to engines {{with the ability to}} advance or retard the timing of both the intake and exhaust {{camshafts}} independently, unlike the original versions of VCT, which only operated on a single camshaft. This allows for improved power and torque, particularly at lower engine RPM, as well as improved fuel economy and reduced emissions. [...] Some Ford Ti-VCT engines use BorgWarner's Cam Torque Actuation (CTA) which utilizes the [...] "existing torsional energy in the valve train to rotate the camshaft" [...] instead of traditional oil pressure <b>driven</b> <b>cam</b> phasing.|$|R

50|$|The {{original}} VFR750F {{was first}} introduced to journalists after the 1985 Bol d'Or, and launched at Jerez, Spain. Introduced for 1986 as a complete redesign of the VF700/750F models {{in order to address}} some of the camshaft and bearing problems that had become associated with the first-generation Honda V4 engines, and to improve Honda's negative image concerning this engine. Compared to the VF750F, the new VFR750F had greater power output (104 hp up from 83 hp), lighter weight (claimed 20 kg), a lower center of gravity, a wider front tire, a slightly shorter wheelbase (15mm) gear <b>driven</b> <b>cams</b> and six rather than five gears.|$|R

Three timing chains are used, one from the crank to the jackshaft, one {{in the front of the}} engine to <b>drive</b> the <b>cam</b> for the left bank, and one on the back of the engine to <b>drive</b> the <b>cam</b> for the right bank.

50|$|The firing tables provide {{data for}} an {{artillery}} piece firing under standardized {{conditions and the}} corrections required to determine the point of impact under actual conditions. There {{were a number of}} ways to implement a firing table using cams. Consider Figure 5 for example. In this case the gun angle as a function of target's range and the target's relative elevation is represented by the thickness of the cam at a given axial distance and angle. A gun direction officer would input the target range and relative elevation using dials. The pin height then represents the required gun angle. This pin height could be used to <b>drive</b> <b>cams</b> or gears that would make other corrections, such as for propellant temperature and projectile type.|$|R

It is even found in lavish stage effects of Broadway productions. The devices are designed to work in real time, taking in information, processing it and producing commands to control a mechanical process as it happens.

50|$|The Honda RVF750R RC45 was a fully faired racing {{motorcycle}} {{created for}} homologation purposes for the Superbike World Championship by Honda Racing Corporation. The RVF750R was {{the successor to}} the VFR750R RC30 (not {{to be confused with}} the sport touring VFR750F). Like its predecessor, the RVF750R featured a DOHC liquid cooled V4 4-stroke engine and a single-sided swingarm with gear <b>driven</b> <b>cams,</b> but unlike the RC30 it utilized electronic fuel injection, in a setup very similar to the production 1992 NR750. The US spec engine had a 749.2cc capacity and was rated at 101 horsepower; the European version was rated at 118 horsepower. A simple rewire modification to the PGM-FI box increased power in the US engine up to the 118 hp. It was manufactured from 1994 until 1995 and sold in limited numbers (the United States receiving the model for its first year only), followed by the VTR1000R SP-1 RC51 in 2000.Unlike the VFR750R RC30 and VFR750F from which the engine was originally derived the gear <b>drive</b> for the <b>cams</b> was moved from the centre of the engine in between the cylinders to the one side allowing a slighter narrower engine.|$|R
