5|$|Following {{several years}} of {{relative}} inactivity as the band maintained their relaxed touring pace, Perry began writing material for a new Daddies album in early 2006, claiming to <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> realization of a cathartic reliance on songwriting. In an April 2006 radio interview, he confirmed that the band was in preparation over recording a new studio album, noting that the music would cover new territory for the Daddies, drawing heavily on tropical themes. This was followed shortly thereafter by the band's first U.S. tour since 2000, where much of this new material was debuted.|$|E

5|$|German {{descendants}} inhabit much {{of central}} and southeast-central Texas. Over one-third of Texas residents are of Hispanic origin; while many have recently arrived, some Tejanos have ancestors with multi-generational ties to 18th century Texas. In addition to {{the descendants of the}} state's former slave population, many African American college graduates <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> state for work recently in the New Great Migration. Recently, the Asian population in Texas has grown—primarily in Houston and Dallas. Other communities with a significantly growing Asian American population is in Austin, Corpus Christi, and the Sharyland area next McAllen, Texas. Three federally recognized Native American tribes reside in Texas: the Alabama-Coushatta Tribe, the Kickapoo Traditional Tribe, and the Ysleta Del Sur Pueblo.|$|E
5|$|Mary's biographers, such as Antonia Fraser, Alison Weir, and John Guy, <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{conclusion}} {{that either the}} documents were complete forgeries, or incriminating passages were inserted into genuine letters, or that the letters were written to Bothwell by some other person or by Mary to some other person. Guy {{points out that the}} letters are disjointed, and that the French language and grammar employed in the sonnets are too poor for a writer with Mary's education. However, certain phrases of the letters (including verses in the style of Ronsard) and certain characteristics of style would be compatible with known writings of Mary.|$|E

5|$|The {{club was}} formed as Christ Church Football Club in 1874, and adopted its current name in 1877.

The closest they <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> title is third in the First Division on three {{occasions}} (1891–92, 1920–21 and 1924–25). As of 2015, the club has spent more seasons in the top division than any other club outside the current Premier League.|$|E
5|$|The medieval chronicler William of Malmesbury {{says that}} the king also seized and {{depopulated}} many miles of land (36 parishes), turning it into the royal New Forest region to support his enthusiastic enjoyment of hunting. Modern historians <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that the New Forest depopulation was greatly exaggerated. Most of the lands of the New Forest are poor agricultural lands, and archaeological and geographic {{studies have shown that}} the New Forest was likely sparsely settled when it was turned into a royal forest. William was known for his love of hunting, and he introduced the forest law into areas of the country, regulating who could hunt and what could be hunted.|$|E
5|$|As the Director-General was {{a public}} officer {{appointed}} by statute to discharge public duties, he was subject to an order of prohibition in an appropriate case. The Court found that on the affidavit evidence produced by the applicants, the Director-General could not reasonably <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion he came to without hearing the applicants' witnesses. He had thus misdirected himself on the law as {{to the nature of}} the evidence that was required to be produced to prove the export of the goods. Finally, there had been an insufficient inquiry which had resulted in a failure to take into account relevant considerations, and an investigation that was unfair to the applicant. The Court therefore made an order of prohibition against the Director-General to prevent him from deducting money from the bankers' guarantees.|$|E

5|$|Through {{studies of}} carbon isotope ratios (similar to the {{methodology}} used in carbon dating, except with the stable isotopes C-12 and C-13), {{it has been}} shown that the carbon found in diamonds comes from both inorganic and organic sources. Some diamonds, known as harzburgitic, are formed from inorganic carbon originally found deep in the Earth's mantle. In contrast, eclogitic diamonds contain organic carbon from organic detritus that has been pushed down from the surface of the Earth's crust through subduction (see plate tectonics) before transforming into diamond. These two different source of carbon have measurably different 13C:12C ratios. Diamonds that <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Earth's surface are generally quite old, ranging from under 1billion to 3.3billion years old. This is 22% to 73% of the age of the Earth.|$|E
5|$|In May 1908, Archibald Leitch {{wrote to}} the Cheshire Lines Committee (CLC) – who had a rail depot {{adjacent}} to the proposed site for the football ground – {{in an attempt to}} persuade them to subsidise construction of the grandstand alongside the railway line. The subsidy would <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sum of £10,000, to be paid back at the rate of £2,000 per annum for five years or half of the gate receipts for the grandstand each year until the loan was repaid. However, despite guarantees for the loan coming from the club itself and two local breweries, both chaired by club chairman John Henry Davies, the Cheshire Lines Committee turned the proposal down. The CLC had planned to build a new station adjacent to the new stadium, with the promise of an anticipated £2,750 per annum in fares offsetting the £9,800 cost of building the station. The station – Trafford Park – was eventually built, but further down the line than originally planned. The CLC later constructed a modest station with one timber-built platform immediately adjacent to the stadium and this opened on 21 August 1935. It was initially named United Football Ground, but was renamed Old Trafford Football Ground in early 1936. It was served on match days only by a shuttle service of steam trains from Manchester Central railway station. It is currently known as Manchester United Football Ground.|$|E
5|$|Whether an epikleros who {{was married}} {{at the time of}} her father's death was {{required}} to divorce her current spouse and marry the anchisteia is unclear. Most modern historians <b>have</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> conclusion that this was only required if the epikleros had not yet had a son that could inherit the grandfather's estate. The clearest evidence is from the Roman playwright Terence, in his play Adelphoe, which includes a plot element involving a claim that a girl is actually an epikleros. Although the play was written in the 2nd century BCE, Terence adapted most of his plays from earlier Athenian comedies, which makes it slightly more reliable as a source. And common sense argues that if a son had already been born to an epikleros, there was no need to parcel out the epikleros to a relative in order to provide a male heir to the grandfather's estate. Although the anchisteia had the right to marry the epikleros, he was not required to do so, and could refuse the match or find another spouse for the heiress. It was also possible for the husband of an epikleros, who was not her anchisteia, to buy off the anchisteia in order to remain married to his wife. Such cases were alleged by the speaker of Isaeus' speech Isaeus 10 as well as a character in Menander's play Aspis.|$|E
