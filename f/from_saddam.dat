Initially, armed resistance groups could {{be characterized as}} either Sunni nationalists who wanted {{to bring back the}} Ba'ath Party with Saddam Hussein, or anti-Saddam fighters. The first major leader of the insurgency in Anbar was Khamis Sirhan al-Muhammad, the Ba'ath party regional chairman for the Karbala Governorate, who was originally No. 54 on the US list of most-wanted Iraqis. According to the US military, Khamis received his funding and orders directly <b>from</b> <b>Saddam,</b> then still a fugitive.|$|E

There were also reports of a SIM card purchased in the US state New Jersey, if this is the case, then this would go back to Iraqi Intelligence Services and Al Qaeda from 9–11 or Jemmah Ismaliyah and Egyptian Islamic Jihad through Iraqi Intelligence <b>from</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein's old network of militants that was never proved. Police had also mentioned that Faheem Ansari, an Indian Lashkar operative who had been arrested in February 2008, had scouted the Mumbai targets for the November attacks.

2500|$|During the Gulf War, 1990–1991, Iraq tried draw Israel {{into the}} {{confrontation}} and thereby {{make it difficult}} for Arab regimes to remain in the coalition. During the war, the Palestinian Liberation Organization (PLO) and King Hussein of Jordan supported Iraq's invasion of Kuwait, while PLO chairman Yasser Arafat had allegedly received $100 million <b>from</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein. However, under strong pressure from the US, which feared direct Israeli involvement would threaten the unity of the coalition, Israel did not retaliate against Iraq and the multinational coalition ousted Iraqi forces from Kuwait. The defeat of Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War [...] "was a devastating blow to ... the Palestinians." [...] After the Gulf War, Kuwaiti authorities forcibly pressured nearly 200,000 Palestinians to leave Kuwait. The policy which partly led to this exodus was a response to the alignment of PLO leader Yasser Arafat with Saddam Hussein. They also withdrew their financial support from the Palestinian cause due to PLO support of Saddam Hussein. It was this political environment that allowed for the PLO to begin talks with the United States and Israel. The First Palestinian Intifada ended with the Madrid Conference of 1991 and the signing of the Oslo Accords by Israel and the PLO in 1993.|$|E

2500|$|In December 2002 Kenneth O'Keefe, an ex-U.S. Marine and Gulf War {{veteran who}} had {{attempted}} multiple times to renounce his U.S. citizenship, posted {{a call to}} action for large numbers of western citizens to migrate to Iraq and deploy themselves as [...] "Human Shields". The action was ultimately named the TJP (Truth Justice Peace) Human Shield Action to Iraq. O'Keefe believed that protests and petitions had no chance of preventing the invasion and that a large presence of western citizens, strategically placed in Iraq at potential targets, was the only viable deterrent to war. He argued that thousands of human shields deployed to these sites would make the invasion politically untenable. O'Keefe publicly acknowledged Saddam Hussein as a [...] "violent dictator" [...] and [...] "mass-murderer" [...] before he arrived in Iraq; it has been speculated he did this in an attempt to neutralize the perception that the human shields were simply pawns of Saddam. [...] Consequently, he received no favor <b>from</b> <b>Saddam,</b> his influence within the action declined rapidly as he traveled to Iraq, and eventually he was deported days before the invasion. Before his deportation he repeatedly alleged U.S. and British support for Hussein during some of his worst crimes; ultimately he argued that it was the people of Iraq who would suffer most from war.|$|E
2500|$|On 5 November 2006, Saddam Hussein {{was sentenced}} to death by hanging for the killing of 148 Shiites from Dujail, in {{retaliation}} for the assassination attempt of 8 July 1982. [...] When the judge announced the verdict, Saddam shouted, [...] "Long live the people. Long live the Arab nation. Down with the spies. God is great." [...] Chief defense lawyer Khalil al-Dulaimi later quoted a statement <b>from</b> <b>Saddam</b> Hussein given just before the Court issued its verdict. He said that Saddam urged his countrymen to [...] "unify in the face of sectarian strife". Al-Dulaimi added that Saddam's message to the people was to [...] "pardon and do not take revenge on the invading nations, its civilians". An appeal, mandated by the Iraqi judicial system, followed. [...] There was speculation that the appeals could last years, postponing his actual execution. However, on 26 December, Saddam's appeal was rejected and the death sentence was given. No further appeals were possible and Saddam had to be executed within 30 days of that date. The decision still had to be ratified by the Iraqi President but could not be commuted. Judge Arif Shaheen, one of the nine appeal judges, said, [...] "It cannot exceed 30 days. As from tomorrow the sentence could be carried out at any time. The appeals court has issued its verdict. What we have decided today is compulsory." ...|$|E

As noted above, US Central Command's wartime mission as envisaged during cold war days was to stop the Soviets from seizing the precious Iranian oil fields. When General Norman Schwarzkopf took over the reins of Central Command he decided to review this mission. In his perceived opinion the threat was no longer from the Soviet Armed Forces, but <b>from</b> <b>Saddam's</b> Iraqi Army. Accordingly, he tasked his operational staff to play up a fresh scenario wherein Iraq would attack Saudi Arabia.|$|R

It was later corroborated not only by United States Army reservists and national guardsmen who spoke to The Los Angeles Times but also by Iraq's own deputy minister of industry, who told The New York Times two months ago that Al Qaqaa was only one of many such weapon caches hijacked on America's undermanned post-invasion watch.|$|R
