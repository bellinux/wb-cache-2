50|$|Until recently, {{the genus}} Clemmys {{consisted}} of four species (bog <b>turtle,</b> <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> western pond turtle, {{and the wood}} turtle). Recent genetic analyses have revealed that the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is distinct from the other three species. The bog turtle and the wood turtle were moved to the genus Glyptemys, while the western pond turtle has been renamed Actinemys. This makes the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> the sole member of the genus Clemmys.|$|R
50|$|<b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> home ranges tend {{to occupy}} limited areas of about 0.5 to 3.5 {{hectares}} (1.2 to 8.6 acres). Note {{that due to}} their size, these small turtles are highly vulnerable to predation, particularly during their frequent terrestrial wanderings. Many specimens will show mutilation injuries and scars from past predation attempts. Raccoons (Procyon lotor) are particularly adept at consuming and killing this species. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> have been observed to dive {{into the water and}} bury themselves in the bottom mud when surprised while basking. Muskrats kill many <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> during the winter dormant period.|$|R
5000|$|In Canada, the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is federally endangered, {{while in}} the United States the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is {{currently}} under review by the Fish and Wildlife Service for protection under the Endangered Species Act. It is listed by the IUCN as endangered, and has [...] "listed" [...] status {{in many of the}} states where it occurs. For example, in Indiana the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is listed as an endangered species. In the Northeast, it has protective status in five of the six New England states and is listed as a species of special concern in New York.|$|R
5|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{and painted}} turtle {{are similar in}} {{appearance}} to the bog turtle. The bog turtle is distinguishable from any other species of turtle by the distinctively colored blotch on its neck. A major difference {{between it and the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> is that the bog turtle has no coloration on the upper shell, unlike the latter species.|$|R
50|$|Although the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{has been}} {{observed}} in Quebec, no permanent population is known to exist there. However, 104 populations have been discovered in Ontario.

5000|$|The black {{pond turtle}} (Geoclemys hamiltonii [...] ), {{also known as the}} <b>spotted</b> pond <b>turtle</b> or the Indian <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> is a species of turtle endemic to South Asia. It belongs to the {{monotypic}} genus Geoclemys.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> {{occupies}} {{a variety of}} habitats including swamps, bogs, fens, marshes, woodland streams, and wet pastures. Also, brackish streams that are influenced by tides can {{also serve as a}} home to this turtle in addition to ditches, vernal pools, and sedge meadows. [...] For a habitat to be sufficient for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> survival it must have areas of soft substrate and at least some aquatic vegetation. [...] An optimum habitat would include shallow and slow moving waters with soft muddy soil, sedge tussocks, water lilies, sphagnum moss, and cattails. [...] Because it is so often found in areas that contain duckweed, the yellow <b>spots</b> on these <b>turtles</b> may serve as a form of camouflage. [...] The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> avoids artificial reservoirs and deep, open-water areas.|$|R

5|$|The genus {{name was}} changed to Glyptemys in 2001. The bog turtle and the wood turtle, Glyptemys insculpta, had until then been {{included}} in the genus Clemmys, which also included <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> (C.guttata) and western pond turtles (C.marmorata). Nucleotide sequencing and ribosomal DNA analyses suggested that bog turtles and wood turtles are closely related, but neither is directly related to <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles,</b> hence the separation of the genus Glyptemys.|$|R
40|$|The <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) is {{categorized}} as protected and {{a species of}} special concern in New York State (Milam 2001). Understanding the habitat use, movement patterns, and life history characteristics of this species will be essential for any future efforts to provide the necessary habitat requirements for their successful recovery and management. Rochester Institute of Technology partnered with the Seneca Park Zoo and the New York Department of Environmental Conservation to investigate the release of captive-bred <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles.</b> The goal {{of this study was}} to determine the movements, habitat use, survivorship, and growth of the captive-bred <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> in a natural environment. The release of suitable numbers of captivebred <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> into a proper environment where their habitat and resource needs are met should lead to individual survival and the establishment of a sustainable population.

40|$|Beginning in {{the fall}} of 2003, a {{behavioral}} ecology study of the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle,</b> Clemmys guttata, implementing radio telemetry was initiated at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL). Both hatchery-raised (headstarted) and native <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> were radio tracked in order to discern anomalous behavior in hatchery-raised turtles and the applicability of the raise-and-release method in reestablishing viable <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> populations in native habitats. Individuals from the study group were monitored regularly, habitat data gathered and positional data logged utilizing GPS technology. The GPS points gathered were used to map hypothetical home ranges for each turtle using GIS technology. No significant difference was found between the summer 2004 headstarted turtle home range sizes and the summer 2005 headstarted turtle home range sizes (Student t-test, α = 0. 05, p = 0. 3073). Also, no significant difference was found between the combined 2004 and 2005 headstarted turtle home range sizes and the combined 2004 and 2005 native turtle home range sizes (Student t-test, α = 0. 05, p = 0. 6088).

40|$|Seasonal habitat use and {{population}} dynamics of a <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) population and an eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina) population in southeastern Massachusetts {{are presented in}} this paper. The two-year study, conducted between March 1998 and December 1999, {{was part of a}} mitigation plan proposed by the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) and approved by the Massachusetts Natural Heritage and Endangered Species Program (NHESP) to mitigate for 1. 0 hectares of direct rare species habitat loss and 1. 6 hectares of indirect habitat loss associated with a highway relocation project in Carver, Kingston, and Plymouth, Massachusetts. Sixty individual <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> were captured in a 29 -hectare study area consisting of upland and wetland habitat in Carver. Of these, 11 <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> were radio tracked. Thirty-seven box turtles were also captured and 7 were radio tracked. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> were observed in wetlands 96 percent of the time, and box turtles 15 percent of the time. During the spring and nesting season, <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> were found exclusively in wetlands. Most activity was observed in an open emergent wetland and a forested vernal pool, with movement between the two habitat types via a stream channel and secondarily via overland travel through the forested wetland. Most turtles estivated in the emergent or forested wetland; only one turtle consistently estivated in forested upland. Hibernacula were found in the forested vernal pool (3) and the emergent wetland (3). The southern ramp of new Route 44 alignment will bisect the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> population. A proposed 1. 8 -meter by 1. 8 -meter box culvert that will convey the stream channel under one of the highway entrance ramps may provide a passageway connecting the emergent wetland to the forested vernal pool; its use will be determined during a future study. Box turtles were generally found in forested upland in the spring, in open upland during the nesting season and summer, with some summer migration to wetlands. Five hibernacula were found, all in forested upland. The new alignment should have less impact on the box turtle population, but will likely result in some loss of nesting habitat and some shifts in home range. Use of nearby replacement nesting habitat will be monitored during a future study. Home ranges averaged 1. 43 hectares for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> and 3. 26 hectares for box turtles. For both species, home ranges were larger for males than for females. The population density for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> was estimated to be 18. 8 turtles per hectare, and for box turtles was estimated to be 3. 0 turtles per hectare...|$|R
40|$|Knowledge {{of species}} with {{multiple}} habitat needs for conservation and species survival planning is scarce. In order to predict areas of habitat suitability and potential further research, suitability modeling is necessary. This research created a GIS-based model to predict habitat suitability {{potential for the}} <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) in four counties of western New York. Because of scarce and conflicting information on <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat needs, a survey was sent out to experts that evaluated <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat parameters. The goal of the habitat model was to predict optimal habitat for sustainable <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> populations {{in an area where}} viable populations had not been confirmed. The surveys were designed to assign relative values to various habitat parameters and derive qualitative and quantitative information for future field assessment measures. The survey and data collection were based on the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP). The method ultimately used for habitat selection was a Hybrid-Deductive approach because of the inductive and deductive reasoning used with scarce and conflicting information on <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> habitat preference. The GIS model selected sites based on an iterative process, resulting in four sites being selected as the “best” habitat sites, combining survey, literature, and GIS data. Model results were compared to historic state sighting records from the NY DEC and fit reasonably well in two of the four counties, but the model did not account for populations that seem to prefer atypical habitats, such as ditches. The model also discarded potentially viable sites (based on land cover) minimally impacted by roads. Results also suggest the need for more detailed soil, road, and land cover data to help determine connectivity between potential habitat sites...|$|R

40|$|In {{order to}} protect {{threatened}} and endangered species, their habitat needs to be adequately documented and assessed for conservation planning. The utilization of mapping programs such as ArcGIS can help researchers in determining the most optimal sites for a particular species in a given area. This research revises a previous habitat suitability model by Correa-Berger (2007) for the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata) in nine counties of upstate New York. Using the same initial parameters {{for the creation of}} the seed sites and habitat requirements for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> that Correa-Berger used in his 2007 analysis, the model utilized updated Land Use/Land Cover (LULC) data, added a stream connectivity parameter, and added a calcium carbonate soil parameter in order to improve the model. The initial updated model did not fit well with the historical <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> sightings from the NYSDEC. A second model was created using a simplified seed site methodology, an adjusted road width parameter, and eliminated the use of the DEC classified wetlands. The revised model captured 16 out of 33 turtle sightings within what was considered optimal sites. While the second model was more successful matching the historical <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> sightings compared to the first model, analysis of model misses suggest the model could potentially be improved {{with the use of a}} locally created LULC classification using remote sensing techniques, expanding the stream connectivity parameters to include stream health, and using additional soil parameters...|$|R

40|$|A new highway {{alignment}} for relocated Route 44 in Carver, Massachusetts, {{resulted in}} the direct alteration of 2. 5 acres and indirect alteration of 3. 9 acres of habitat for three statelisted turtle species: the wood <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys insculpta), <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> (Clemmys guttata), and eastern box turtle (Terrapene c. carolina). As part of the mitigation requirements for impacts to rare species habitat, the Massachusetts Highway Department (MassHighway) conducted a two year preconstruction study to determine the habitat preferences and seasonal movements of the statelisted species. The study determined that no wood turtles {{were present in the}} study area, that there was a large but declining population of box turtles, and that two highly used <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> habitats would be bisected by the proposed highway entrance ramp. An intermittent stream channel proposed to be piped under the new entrance ramp was identified as a primary travel corridor between the two habitats. Based on the findings of the preconstruction study, MassHighway identified a simple solution to allow the stream channel to continue to provide a migratory corridor for <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles.</b> To achieve this goal, MassHighway increased the proposed culvert size from a 24 inch pipe to a 6 foot by 6 foot box culvert. In {{the spring and summer of}} 2004, postconstruction monitoring was conducted to determine the effectiveness of the culvert as a <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> crossing structure. Nine turtles were fitted with radio transmitters and thread bobbins and followed three times per week in the spring and early summer, and once per week in the late summer to determine culvert effectiveness. Direct evidence (thread trails, visual observation) was documented for seven turtles, and indirect evidence (radio telemetry points on both sides of the culvert, visual observation) was documented for 13 turtles, confirming the use of the culvert as a crossing structure. A future study is recommended to document potential effects of traffic and noise on the <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> population, continued use of the culvert, and potential changes to rare species habitat from the highway construction...|$|R
40|$|Loss {{of access}} to {{critical}} habitats is a key wildlife concern, particularly for species listed for protection by state and federal agencies. Rail corridors pose unique design challenges {{by virtue of the}} need to avoid abrupt changes in track curves and grade in the right of way (ROW). <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> (Clemmys guttata) are particularly vulnerable to habitat fragmentation due to their limited mobility and dependence on a diversity of specific foraging, nesting, and aestivation habitats. <b>Spotted</b> <b>turtles</b> also display an apparent reluctance to enter or cross through narrow and confined culverts typically found under road and rail line ROWs. In association with the Greenbush Line Commuter Railroad Restoration Project, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority initiated a demonstration project in spring of 2003 to determine the effectiveness of a proposed railroad crossing structure in an urbanized landscape. Three identical, open-air prototypes were positioned in the ROW of a former railroad bed between adjacent wetlands known to support <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles.</b> Each structure was linked with temporary funneling barriers along the track edges. Structure placement was in accordance with microhabitat survey assessments, radio telemetry data, and direct movement observations. To evaluate the effectiveness of the structures, remote photographic stations were established at each crossing, and radio telemetry was used to track turtle movements. Monitoring was conducted from April 2, 2003, until July 8, 2003. Study results demonstrated <b>spotted</b> <b>turtle</b> crossing patterns and frequency through the ROW during the monitoring period similar to that prior to barrier development. Crossings also were shown to be utilized by 17 other wildlife species, including reptiles, amphibians, birds, and mammals. The demonstration project concluded that location and design of the crossing structures provided an effective means of maintaining habitat connectivity for a variety of wildlife species, as well as <b>spotted</b> <b>turtles.</b> As part of the Conservation and Management Plan developed for the Greenbush Line Project, which is now under construction, 45 wildlife crossing structures are proposed at key locations along the ROW.
