5|$|Rosenberg left a will {{in which}} he {{requested}} that his body be cremated using quicklime. Most of his estate was left to his children; the will stated that his Torah and yad were {{to be given to}} his son Adolph, but this was not <b>done</b> <b>as</b> they remained in Hawaii.|$|E
5|$|The Act {{is divided}} into six parts, forty-three {{sections}} and four schedules, and focuses upon five specific areas of law. These are the duty of care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive remuneration for work <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a trustee.|$|E

5|$|A {{road in the}} {{location}} of PA284 first shows on maps as early as 1873. PA284 was first designated along its current alignment during the 1928 renumbering of state highways in Pennsylvania. The designation was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a spur to the alignment of PA84, which was designated from Piatt Township to the New York state line. The entire alignment of PA284 was paved by the Pennsylvania Department of Highways in 1932, including the bridge over Flooks Run and Blacks Creek. However, the alignment has remained relatively unchanged since. In 1961, with the designation of Interstate 84, the alignment of PA84 was re-designated as PA287 to avoid duplication.|$|E
5|$|According to Kuhn, {{science is}} an {{inherently}} communal activity {{which can only}} be <b>done</b> <b>as</b> part of a community. For him, the fundamental difference between science and other disciplines {{is the way in which}} the communities function. Others, especially Feyerabend and some post-modernist thinkers, have argued that there is insufficient difference between social practices in science and other disciplines to maintain this distinction. For them, social factors play an important and direct role in scientific method, but they do not serve to differentiate science from other disciplines. On this account, science is socially constructed, though this does not necessarily imply the more radical notion that reality itself is a social construct.|$|E
5|$|During {{the reign}} of Kithsirimevan (301–328), Sudatta, the sub king of Kalinga, and Hemamala brought the Tooth Relic of the Buddha to Sri Lanka because of unrest in their country. Kithsirimevan carried it in {{procession}} and placed the relic in a mansion named Datadhatughara. He ordered this procession to be held annually, and this is still <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a tradition in the country. The Tooth Relic of the Buddha soon {{became one of the}} most sacred objects in the country, and a symbol of kingship. The person who was in possession of the Tooth Relic would be the rightful ruler of the country. Therefore, it was often enshrined within the royal palace itself.|$|E

5|$|Each {{successive}} {{scene in}} the sequence was shorter {{than the one before}} it by exactly one frame. The scene where Bart writes his confession was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> one long take to balance the shorter scenes elsewhere in the episode. It was animated in the United States by Dan Haskett. There were a few problems with the finished animation for the episode. The banana in the opening scene was colored incorrectly, as the Korean animators were unfamiliar with the fruit, and the final bathtub scene was particularly problematic, including issues with lip sync. The version in the broadcast episode was the best of several attempts.|$|E
5|$|For the Papuan Campaign, MacArthur awarded Blamey the American Distinguished Service Cross, and Blamey {{was created}} a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the British Empire on 28 May 1943. This was unusual {{as it was}} the Australian Labor Party's policy not to award knighthoods, but was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a {{response}} to the British government's awards to British and American officers for the North African campaign. Blamey's and Herring's knighthoods would be the last that the Labor government would award to Australian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|Fourth Degree Knights may {{optionally}} {{purchase and}} wear the full regalia and join an assembly's Color Corps. The Color Corps {{is the most}} visible arm of the Knights, as they are often seen in parades and other local events wearing their colorful regalia. Official dress for the Color Corps is a black tuxedo, baldric, white gloves, cape, and naval chapeau. In warm climates and during warm months, a white dinner jacket may be worn, if <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a unit.|$|E

5|$|In 1978, Gravel {{authored}} {{and secured}} the passage into {{law of the}} General Stock Ownership Corporation, that became Subchapter U of the Tax Code under the Internal Revenue Code of 1954.

5|$|Phát and Thảo were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially <b>done</b> <b>as</b> far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup. The new junta decided to ignore Khiêm’s actions and he remained in Washington as the ambassador, with no further action taken. Phát and Thảo stayed in hiding in Catholic villages. They offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty.|$|E

5|$|The Act covers five {{areas of}} trust law: {{the duty of}} care imposed upon trustees, trustees' power of investment, the power to appoint nominees and agents, the power to acquire land, {{and the power to}} receive {{remuneration}} for work <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a trustee. It sets a new duty of care, both objective and standard, massively extends the trustees' power of investment and limits the trustees' liability for the actions of agents, also providing for their remuneration for work done {{in the course of the}} trust.|$|E
5|$|The French {{national}} stud, the Haras Nationaux, {{allows the}} registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer, {{but does not}} allow the registration of cloned horses. It considers the breed to be endangered, along with several other French draft breeds. A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais, along with four other French breeds, should be a conservation priority, with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France's native horse population. This follows from studies <b>done</b> <b>as</b> early as 1983 that showed inbreeding {{and a lack of}} genetic diversity in the breed.|$|E
5|$|The {{campaign}} group Friends of Suburban Bristol Railways held {{a celebration}} in 2009 {{to mark the}} increase in passenger numbers. They were joined by pupils from Parson Street Primary School who had provided artwork to brighten up the station. This was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> part of the Severnside Schools Community Stations Programme, organised by the Severnside Community Rail Partnership. The Severnside CRP also installed plant displays in 2008, and in 2011 distributed leaflets advertising train services to local residents, in association with Bristol City Council and Passenger Focus. In January 2017 a group called Friends of Parson Street Railway Station was formed to lobby for improvements to facilities and services at the station.|$|E

5|$|The {{development}} team included director Takumi Nakazawa, {{writer and}} planner Kotaro Uchikoshi, character designer Yuu Takigawa, and composer Takeshi Abo. Because the science fiction aspects of Never 7 had been positively received, Ever 17 {{was made with}} a larger focus on science fiction. A remake, simply titled Ever 17, was developed by 5pb. and Cyberfront for Xbox 360 in 2011, with the original's 2D sprites replaced by 3D models; this change was <b>done</b> <b>as</b> 3D models were seen as being easier to animate. The game has been positively received, with reviewers calling {{it one of the}} best in its genre, citing its story, characters, music, and graphics.|$|E
5|$|Thảo and Phát were {{stripped}} of their ranks, but nothing was initially <b>done</b> <b>as</b> far as prosecuting or sentencing them for their involvement in the coup for the time being. They went into hiding in Catholic villages and offered to surrender and support the government if they and their officers were granted amnesty. However, this failed to materialize, and in May 1965, a military tribunal loyal to Kỳ sentenced both to death in absentia.|$|E
5|$|Male {{circumcision}} is {{the removal}} of the foreskin from the human penis. In the most common procedure, the foreskin is opened, adhesions are removed, and the foreskin is separated from the glans. After that, a circumcision device may be placed and then the foreskin is cut off. Topical or locally injected anesthesia is used to reduce pain and physiologic stress. For adults and children, general anesthesia is an option and the procedure may be performed without a specialized circumcision device. The procedure is most often an elective surgery performed on babies and children for religious or cultural reasons. In other cases it may be <b>done</b> <b>as</b> a treatment for certain medical conditions or for preventative reasons. Medically it is a treatment option for problematic cases of phimosis, balanoposthitis that does not resolve with other treatments, and chronic urinary tract infections (UTIs). It is contraindicated in cases of certain genital structure abnormalities or poor general health.|$|E
