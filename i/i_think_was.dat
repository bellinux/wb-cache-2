But, you know, we had one member of the United States Senate vote against the PATRIOT Act, the blank check that was given by Congress to this president, I think in total abrogation of the role of Congress under separation of powers and under the power to make war, to declare war.

500|$|Roger Ebert gave On Stranger Tides {{two out of}} four stars, {{saying that}} {{although}} the removal of Knightley and Bloom {{as well as the}} addition of Cruz were positive aspects, the film in general was [...] "too much of a muchness" [...] for him. Tom Long of The Detroit News gave a D+, saying that Jack Sparrow had [...] "worn out his welcome". Despite the more linear plot, [...] "the movie is still ridiculous". He found On Stranger Tides to be [...] "precisely what you'd expect of the fourth installment of a movie based on an amusement park ride: a whole lot of noise, plenty of stunts and complete silliness." [...] British film critic Mark Kermode gave the film an overwhelmingly negative review on his 5 Live show, saying [...] "it's not as staggeringly misjudged as the third part, because it is just nothing, it is just a big empty nothing, whereas part three <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> an active atrocity, it's just nothing at all".|$|E
500|$|Chosen {{to provide}} the score for Quatermass and the Pit was Tristram Cary. He {{developed}} an interest in electronic music while serving in the Royal Navy as an electronics expert working on radar during the Second World War. He became a professional composer in 1954, working in film, theatre, radio and television, with credits including The Ladykillers (1955). He said of his assignment, “I was not mad about doing the film because Hammer wanted masses of electronic material {{and a great deal}} of orchestral music. But I had three kids, all of which were at fee-paying schools, so I needed every penny I could get!”. Cary also recalled that, “The main use of electronics in Quatermass, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> the violent shaking, vibrating sound that the [...] "thing in the tunnel" [...] gave off [...] It was not a terribly challenging sound to do, though I never played it very loud because I didn't want to destroy my speakers – I did have hopes of destroying a few cinema loudspeaker systems, though it never happened”. Carey went on to write the score for another Hammer film, Blood from the Mummy's Tomb, in 1971. Several orchestral and electronic cues from the film were released by GDI Records on a compilation titled The Quatermass Film Music Collection.|$|E
500|$|In 2013, she lent {{her voice}} to the {{character}} of Ishani, the reigning Pan-Asian champion from India and the love interest of the main protagonist in the Disney Animation Studios's film Planes, a spinoff of Pixar's Cars franchise. Chopra, a fan of Disney films, had fun voicing the character saying [...] "The closest I could come to being a Disney princess, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>was</b> Ishani". The film was a commercial success, grossing approximately US$240 million worldwide. She played an NRI girl in the Apoorva Lakhia's bilingual action drama Zanjeer (Thoofan in Telugu), a remake of the 1973 Hindi film of the same name, which met with poor reactions from critics and was unsuccessful at the box office. Chopra next reprised her role of Priya in Rakesh Roshan's Krrish 3a sequel to the 2006 superhero film Krrishwith Hrithik Roshan, Vivek Oberoi and Kangana Ranaut. The film earned positive reviews though critics opined that Chopra's role in the film was small. Writing for Daily News and Analysis, Sarita A Tanwar commented that [...] "Priyanka is saddled with a role that doesn't do her justice. She deserved a meatier role." [...] The feature became a box office success, earning over [...] worldwide, to become Chopra's biggest commercial success till date and her fourth major hit in the last two years. She also appeared in an item number titled [...] "Ram Chahe Leela" [...] for Sanjay Leela Bhansali's Goliyon Ki Rasleela Ram-Leela. The song, which took four days to rehearse, saw Chopra execute a contemporary mujra, that incorporated complicated dance steps.|$|E

500|$|Former Living Single star T. C. Carson {{was hired}} as Eugene Dix. Carson {{identified}} his role as [...] "a very by-the-book type of person but soon has {{a change of heart}} as the corpses begin to pile up." [...] The crew was enticed of Carson's casting, with Bress mentioning how his [...] "originally envisioned Woody Allen-type of character has got ten more times life than it ever had. It's got ten times the personality, this charisma that T.C. brings to it...he's just such a great presence." [...] Similarly, Perry was astonished by how Carson [...] "can take the most absurd lines and deliver them in such grammatized form with his eyes and his deep rich speaking voice." [...] Jonathan Cherry, who recently emerged in the 2003 film House of the Dead, was appointed as Rory Peters. Cherry characterized Rory as [...] "a very opposite of me whose arc goes from, 'I don't really care at all', to 'Oh my God, this is really happening!'" [...] In the script, Bress said that Rory was his favorite character to write since [...] "he's great comic relief, he's got a drug problem, he's funny, and he's all that." [...] Bress bragged that [...] "Cherry is awesome, awesome casting cause he's just so funny and the way he delivers his lines. It's like 'Oh yeah. That's good! That's better!'" [...] "What <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>was</b> surprising on him was that from all of the humor he's involved and his sort of itchiness that he has with Kat, there is some moments where he reveals how vulnerable he really is and so the shield comes down and right in there you're really becoming sympathetic to Rory. You like him at first cause he's the funny guy, but then you care about him because you realize that there's a place that humor comes from that we all share," [...] Perry appended.|$|E

2500|$|During March 2007, Blagojevich {{announced}} and {{campaigned for}} his universal healthcare plan, Illinois Covered. The plan was debated in the Illinois State Senate, but came one vote short of passing. He proposed {{to pay for}} the plan with the largest tax increase in Illinois history. He proposed a gross receipts tax on businesses, a $7.6 billion tax increase, with proceeds earmarked to provide universal healthcare in Illinois, increase education spending by $1.5 billion, fund a $25 billion capital construction plan, and reduce the State's $40 billion pension debt. Illinois House Speaker Michael Madigan called for a vote on a non-binding resolution on whether the state should impose a gross receipts tax. When it became apparent that the resolution would be defeated, Blagojevich announced at the last minute that supporters should vote against it, although the vote was intended to be a test vote to gauge whether the measure had any support. The request was seen by many lawmakers from both parties as an attempt to spin the loss positively. It was defeated by a vote of 107–0, which the Associated Press termed [...] "jaw-dropping."
