It is likely that the gold came from melted-down coins of the Merovingian dynasty of Francia. The Frankish currency underwent a similar debasing at around this time. The link with Francia is illustrative of the trading and cultural links that existed between Anglo-Saxon England and continental Europe at the time.|$|E

25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of {{phosphor}} bronze, stainless steel, beryllium copper, or a <b>gold</b> <b>alloy.</b> The B thumb keys {{typically have}} flat springs. Phosphor bronze {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|E

50|$|Common colored <b>gold</b> <b>alloys</b> {{include the}} {{distinctive}} eighteen-karat rose gold {{created by the}} addition of copper. Alloys containing palladium or nickel are also important in commercial jewelry as these produce white <b>gold</b> <b>alloys.</b> Fourteen-karat gold-copper alloy is nearly identical in color to certain bronze alloys, and both may be used to produce police and other badges. White <b>gold</b> <b>alloys</b> can be made with palladium or nickel. Fourteen- and eighteen-karat <b>gold</b> <b>alloys</b> with silver alone appear greenish-yellow and are referred to as green gold. Blue gold can be made by alloying with iron, and purple gold can be made by alloying with aluminium. Less commonly, addition of manganese, aluminium, indium and other elements can produce more unusual colors of gold for various applications.|$|R
25|$|Nitric acid, after {{distillation}} {{to increase}} the acid strength, is capable of dissolving the silver {{but it will not}} (by itself) dissolve the gold. However, nitric acid is not able to (fully) extract silver and other impurities from an alloy with a high content of gold. Therefore, one part of scrap gold was typically alloyed with three parts of copper (quartering) before parting with nitric acid. Another method uses Sterling silver instead of copper. One part pure gold is alloyed with three parts Sterling silver (inquarting). The resulting six karat (6K) gold can then be parted with dilute nitric acid (one part 68-70% nitric acid to one part DISTILLED water). With the karat gold this low (6K), and over medium high heat, the dilute nitric acid will dissolve the Sterling silver (and other base metals in the karat gold) starting on the outside surface of the 6K <b>gold</b> <b>alloy,</b> working its way into the <b>gold</b> <b>alloy,</b> forming a honeycomb structure as it works its way into the metals. Since nitric acid will not dissolve gold, nearly pure gold (very close to 99.5% pure) will be left behind after the reaction is complete. After removing the solid gold other elements like silver and copper may be extracted from the liquid. To get the gold to a very high level of purity (999 fine gold) it is sometimes processed further with aqua regia to effectively remove all the impurities.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is the study of the {{influence}} of addition of Si, Ni and Co on the microstructure and mechanical feature of Is-ct <b>gold</b> <b>alloys,</b> in order to reduce production rejects in the investment cast process. For this reason, a typical alloy containing Ag, Cu and Zn usually used for jewelry manufacturing, has been used to prepare four master alloys with variable concentrations of Si, Co and Ni; 18 -ct <b>gold</b> <b>alloys</b> were also prepared. It has been demonstrated that the increasing of Si concentration induces embrittlement in <b>gold</b> <b>alloys.</b> XPS analysis on fractured samples revealed the presence of SiO 2 at the grain boundaries of samples containing 0. 25 wt. % of Si. The addition of Ni and Co permitted to obtain <b>gold</b> <b>alloys</b> with good mechanical properties and surface finishing. It has been also demonstrated that Ni and Co form insoluble intermetallic compounds with Si that decrease SiO 2 content at the grain boundaries thus preventing embrittlement.
