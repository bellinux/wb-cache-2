5|$|After the war, Patton {{became the}} {{military}} governor of Bavaria, {{but he was}} relieved of this post because of <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> trivializing denazification. He commanded the United States Fifteenth Army for slightly more than two months. Patton died in Germany on December 21, 1945, {{as a result of}} injuries from an automobile accident twelve days earlier.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} in Adrianople, Bahá'u'lláh wrote a great deal. One of the main themes during this time was the {{proclamation}} of his claimed mission; he instructed some of his followers to take his claims to Bábís in Iran and Iraq who had not heard of <b>his</b> <b>statements,</b> as well as asking the Bahá'ís to be united and detached from the world. He also started to write about distinctive Bahá'í beliefs and practices.|$|E

5|$|In 1827, he {{published}} two volumes of Personal Sketches of His Own Times. In 1830, by an address from both Houses of Parliament, he {{was removed from}} the Bench, in consequence of well-proven misappropriation of public moneys. The third volume of Personal Sketches appeared in 1833 as did the delayed volume of his Historic Memoirs. This book was subsequently reproduced in a cheaper form as The Rise and Fall of the Irish Nation. His works are interesting, racy, and valuable – although <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> of fact cannot always be depended on – containing much of personal incident, related in a fascinating style. He died at Versailles on 8 April 1834.|$|E
5|$|Lincoln ran for {{election}} as governor {{in his own}} right in 1809, but he was perceived by moderate Federalists as overly partisan and lacked the charisma of Sullivan. His support for Jefferson's economic policy, particularly that of embargoing trade with Great Britain and France (who were then embroiled in the Napoleonic Wars) was costly. Federalists, who had regained control of the Massachusetts legislature in 1808, attacked <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> in support of Jefferson, and he lost the election to Christopher Gore, amid a complete Federalist takeover of the Massachusetts government (the outgoing Jefferson administration's repeal of the embargo before the election notwithstanding).|$|E
5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> at the emergency meeting five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a plan of attack was formulated.|$|E

5|$|The State of California charged Alvarado and {{his friend}} with first-degree murder and {{attempted}} robbery. Alvarado attempted to suppress <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> given during the Comstock interview {{on the basis that}} he was not read his Miranda rights. The trial court denied the motion on the basis that Alvarado was not in police custody at the time he gave his statement. Alvarado was subsequently convicted, primarily based on statements Alvarado made during his police interrogation. Alvarado's conviction was reduced by the trial judge to second-degree murder for his comparatively minor role in the offense. The California Courts of Appeal affirmed the conviction and agreed that Alvarado was not in custody. The Supreme Court of California declined discretionary review.|$|E
5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the gist of his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|Hindman's assassins {{were never}} caught, and many {{theories}} regarding their identities have circulated throughout the years. In 1869, a white prisoner at the Phillips County jail told officials that he overheard two black inmates, Sip Cameron and Heyward Grant, discussing the crime. Grant supposedly {{confessed to the}} crime, saying the murder {{was part of a}} larger plot to seek revenge for the killing of Lee Morrison, a black person from Helena who had been hanged on September 27, 1868. Grant's claims did not fit with the facts of the murder, and <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> were dismissed from the investigation. No further leads ever developed, so the case was never reopened. Hindman was buried at Evergreen Cemetery (later named Maple Hill Cemetery) in Helena, near the grave of his friend Patrick Cleburne.|$|E

5|$|In 1924, Sadler began hosting Sunday tea gatherings at his home, {{which could}} {{accommodate}} fifty guests. Many attendees {{worked in the}} medical establishment, and typically adhered to a progressive ideology. The group often held a forum to discuss the patient with the sleep issue and devise questions for him. The observers withheld the man's name from the group, but relayed some of <b>his</b> <b>statements.</b> In 1925, the forum, which then had thirty members, closed their meetings to visitors and began to require a pledge of secrecy. Sadler instructed forum members not to publicize what they learned, telling them that they had an incomplete picture of what was occurring. He also feared that the patient would face criticism if his identity were known. His identity has never been confirmed; Joscelyn Godwin, of Colgate University, and skeptic Martin Gardner posit that the sleeping man was Wilfred Kellogg, the husband of Lena's sister Anna.|$|E
5|$|In early 1935, {{however, the}} company {{heard about the}} game's {{excellent}} sales during the Christmas season of 1934 in Philadelphia and at F.A.O. Schwarz in New York City. Robert Barton, President of Parker Brothers, contacted Darrow and scheduled a new meeting in New York City. On March 18, Parker Brothers bought Darrow's game, helped him take out a patent on it, and purchased his remaining inventory. By April, 1935, the company had learned that Darrow was not the sole inventor of the game, but sought out an affidavit by Darrow to repeat <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> to the contrary, and thus bolster their claim to the game. Parker Brothers subsequently decided to buy out Magie's 1924 patent and the copyrights of other commercial variants of the game to claim that it had legitimate undisputed rights to the game.|$|E
5|$|More detail for {{the whole}} period is {{provided}} by Plutarch, in his biographies of Themistocles, Aristides and especially Cimon. Plutarch was writing some 600 years after the events in question, and is therefore a secondary source, but he often names his sources, which allows some degree of verification of <b>his</b> <b>statements.</b> In his biographies, he draws directly from many ancient histories that have not survived, and thus often preserves details of the period that are omitted in Herodotus and Thucydides's accounts. The final major existing source for the period is the universal history (Bibliotheca historica) of the 1st century BC Sicilian, Diodorus Siculus. Much of Diodorus's writing about this period is drawn from the much earlier Greek historian Ephorus, who also wrote a universal history. Diodorus is also a secondary source and often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient period found nowhere else.|$|E

5|$|On August 18, 2007, Anderson gave an {{interview}} in which he admitted to using steroids when he was performing on the independent wrestling scene, stating that he had quit using them in November 2005 to comply with WWE's Talent Wellness Program, implying that his job in the promotion was worth more than extra muscle mass. 12 days later, on August 30, <b>his</b> <b>statements</b> were shown to be incorrect when he, along with nine other WWE wrestlers, were named in a Sports Illustrated article as having received performance-enhancing drugs in direct non-compliance with the WWE Talent Wellness Program. Anderson received anastrozole, somatropin, and testosterone between October 2006 and February 2007. He later claimed that the steroids were for a legitimate medical reason, {{saying that they were}} from when he tore his latissimus dorsi muscle in 2005.|$|E
