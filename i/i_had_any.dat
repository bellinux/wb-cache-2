25|$|E: As I lay in {{bed that}} night, I overheard the three doctors tell my parents {{in the other room}} that their boy would be dead in the morning. I felt intense anger that anyone should tell a mother her boy would be dead by morning. My mother then came in with as serene a face as can be. I asked her to arrange the dresser, push it up {{against the side of the}} bed at an angle. She did not {{understand}} why, she thought I was delirious. My speech was difficult. But at that angle by virtue of the mirror on the dresser I could see through the doorway, through the west window of the other room. I was damned if I would die without seeing one more sunset. If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> skill in drawing, I could still sketch that sunset.|$|E

He {{did not attend the}} march due to church duties, but he later wrote, [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> idea that the state troopers would use the kind of brutality they did, I would have felt compelled to give up my church duties altogether to lead the line." [...] Footage of police brutality against the protesters was broadcast extensively and aroused national public outrage.|$|E
500|$|According to {{journalist}} and Britain's Got Talent judge Piers Morgan, Talbot's performances resulted in many children, including Faryl Smith, auditioning {{for the second}} series of the show. After his victory, series 2 winner George Sampson spoke of his participation in the first series, where he was knocked out before the live shows, saying [...] "I don't think <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> shot of winning last year... When {{you look at the}} standard of Paul Potts and Connie Talbot. Paul Potts is out of this league, and Connie is out of this league – I wasn't good enough." [...] Talbot voted for Sampson, saying [...] "I liked his dancing – he was good on the lamppost".|$|E

500|$|Opening side two, [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] was a {{composition}} that McCartney had first recorded in 1974, {{on the same}} piano demo tape as [...] "Getting Closer". [...] "Rockestra Theme" [...] is an instrumental – except for the shouted line [...] "Why haven't <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> dinner?", which author Robert Rodriguez describes as a [...] "deliberate evocation" [...] of Glenn Miller's 1940 single [...] "Pennsylvania 6-5000". Another rock track, [...] "To You" [...] includes a lyric aimed at a lover who has wronged the singer. The guitar solo on the recording provides an unusual aspect for a Wings song, in that Juber played the part through an Avonside harmonizer while McCartney simultaneously altered the harmonizer's settings from the studio's control room.|$|E
500|$|Actress Jennifer Aniston made a guest {{appearance}} on [...] "All Mixed Up". Speculations of her appearance initially surfaced a year {{prior to the}} confirmation, and upon hearing of it, Cougar Town co-creator Bill Lawrence initially supported such allegations. Lawrence stated that he announced that Aniston would appear on the television series, but had not contacted her or her representatives. Eventually, Lawrence averted away from his claims and stated that [...] "nothing's happened yet". He continued in his interview with E! Online: [...] "I'd kill to get Jennifer on the show, and if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> inclination it was happening, I would be telling everybody 'cause I don't really give a sh-t. I would love it to happen and the second it did I would tell everybody in the world, but nothing's happened." ...|$|E
500|$|Following the match, referee Nicolae Rainea {{explained}} {{his decision to}} play the match despite heavy fog: [...] "When I went out there before kick-off I decided I could see well enough and so I decided to play. I am afraid many spectators would not get a very clear view {{but there was no}} time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> thoughts of abandoning the game." [...] Liverpool manager Bob Paisley was critical of the decision to play the match: [...] "You can't play football in conditions like that, it's ridiculous." [...] Paisley suggested the competition should be played in April when the weather was better: [...] "I think a match like this, between two leading team should be played in better weather, say in April. I know it's difficult, but it's farcical when good players like these have to slither about in fog and can't see each other." ...|$|E

500|$|Poe {{claimed he}} wrote [...] "Al Aaraaf" [...] {{before he was}} 15 years old, though he would later adapt his claim. A few {{passages}} from the poem were first published in the May 19, 1829, issue of the Baltimore Gazette signed [...] "Marlow". Poe first offered the complete poem to publishers Carey, Lea & Carey in Philadelphia around May 1829. He wrote to them, [...] "If the poem is published, succeed or not, I am 'irrecoverably a poet.' But to your opinion I leave it". He met with Isaac Lea, {{who was willing to}} publish it so long as they were protected against any loss. Poe asked his foster-father John Allan to subsidize the printing but, not supportive of Poe's literary pursuits, he refused. By July 28, Poe wrote to the publishers asking for the return of his manuscript because, as he said, he had [...] "made a better disposition of my poems than <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> right to expect".|$|E
500|$|To {{treat these}} conditions, Jackson used Solaquin, Tretinoin, and Benoquin. On June 29, 2009, {{multiple}} tubes of Benoquin and hydroquinone {{were found in}} Jackson's home. Both creams are commonly used to treat vitiligo; Dr. David Sawcer said some patients with vitiligo {{get to the point}} where it makes more sense to remove the brown bits because so much of the skin is pale. On the other hand, getting depigmented skin to darken is extremely difficult. Depigmentation causes a permanent and extreme sensitivity to the sun. Vitiligo patients are at risk to contract melanoma, and an annual cancer check-up is recommended. Jackson also had hydroxychloroquine injected directly into his scalp regularly. Another common way of treating vitiligo is using makeup to camouflage depigmented skin. The treatments Jackson used for his condition further lightened his skin tone, and with the application of pancake makeup to even out his skin tone, he could appear very pale. For example, Stevie Nicks recalled in a Rolling Stone interview: [...] "I remember before , Michael sent somebody to find out if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> foundation make-up he could borrow. I was using some light Chanel foundation at that time, and Michael sent back a note to say, thanks, but the foundation wasn't quite light enough for him." [...] Jackson also covered his skin disorder with clothing wearing long sleeves and long pants. In the music video for [...] "Remember the Time," [...] all dancers and actors except for Jackson are lightly dressed following the example set by ancient Egyptians. Jackson usually avoided wearing patterned clothing to avoid attention to the disorder.|$|E
500|$|McEntire's seventy-sixth chart single, [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain", {{released}} in mid-2003, ended her two-year break from recording. In November 2003, her twenty-third studio album, Room to Breathe, marked her first release of new material in four years. Writing for The Boston Globe, Steve Morse found the album's material {{to have a}} variety of musical stylings, saying the track [...] "Love Revival" [...] sounded like Tanya Tucker and calling [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>Had</b> <b>Any</b> Sense at All" [...] "a mournful country ballad". Dan MacIntosh of Country Standard Time gave Room to Breathe a less-received review, reporting that [...] "it ultimately falls short of leaving the listener breathless". He highlighted [...] "I'm Gonna Take That Mountain" [...] for sounding like a Bluegrass-inspired song such as music by Ricky Skaggs or Patty Loveless. The album itself reached a peak of No. 4 on the Billboard Top Country Albums chart and No.25 on the Billboard 200, staying at the position for only one week. The second single, [...] "Somebody", also recorded by Mark Wills on his [...] "Loving Every Minute" [...] release, became her twenty-second number-one single on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart and first since [...] "If You See Him/If You See Her" [...] six years previous. This became her thirty-third number-one single overall. It took longer than expected to become a hit, according to McEntire, who said, [...] "Yeah, that had us concerned. The album came out in November and it took 30 weeks for [...] "Somebody" [...] to work its way up the charts. Usually, it's 15 weeks. But this one had a resurgence of life, especially after the video came out. MCA is really kicking butt with it." [...] Its third single, [...] "He Gets That from Me" [...] reached No. 7, followed by the Amy Dalley co-written track [...] "My Sister", which reached No. 16.|$|E

2500|$|In {{his review}} of The Art of Angel Sanctuary 2: Lost Angel, A.E. Sparrow of IGN praised the artbook, {{describing}} it as [...] "more of an encyclopedia or compendium for the series".

Dorrian said, [...] "I don't believe <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> bruises. It was just a figure of speech."

2500|$|Newman was an {{auto racing}} enthusiast, despite being colorblind, and first became {{interested}} in motorsports ("the first thing that I ever found <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> grace in") while training at the Watkins Glen Racing School for the filming of Winning, a 1969 film. Because of his love and passion for racing, Newman agreed in 1971 to star in and to host his first television special, Once Upon a Wheel, {{on the history of}} auto racing. It was produced and directed by David Winters, who co-owned a number of racing cars with Newman. Newman's first professional event as a racer was in 1972 at Thompson International Speedway, quietly entered as [...] "P.L. Newman", by which he continued to be known in the racing community.|$|E
2500|$|After his songwriting {{contributions}} {{were rejected}} from the band's previous album, 1986's Somewhere in Time, Dickinson felt that his role within the band had diminished, as he [...] "just became the singer," [...] but felt renewed enthusiasm when Harris explained the concept to him; [...] "I thought, 'What a great idea! Brilliant!' And of course I was really chuffed, too, because he'd actually rung {{me to talk}} about it and ask me if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> songs that might fit that sort of theme. I was like, 'Well, no, but give me a minute and I'll see what I can do.'" [...] Speaking about the record in later years, however, Dickinson remarked that [...] "we almost did [...] ", explaining that, [...] "it was only half a concept album. There was no attempt to see it all the way through, like we really should have done. Seventh Son... has no story. It's about good and evil, heaven and hell, but isn't every Iron Maiden record?" ...|$|E
2500|$|The harsh {{reception}} that Vestiges received, and the mockery {{which was}} made of its evolutionary ideas, has been cited by some historians as a factor leading to Darwin's caution in publishing his own theory of evolution. In a letter to Thomas Henry Huxley in 1854 (five years before his own book on evolution was published but twelve years after its ideas had first been sketched out in an unpublished essay), Darwin expressed sympathy for the (still anonymous) author of Vestiges {{in the face of}} a savage review by Huxley: [...] "I must think that such a book, if it does no other good, spreads the taste for Natural Science. But I am perhaps no fair judge, for I am almost as unorthodox about species as the Vestiges itself, though I hope not quite so unphilosophical." [...] However, later the same year, in a letter to Hooker, Darwin mentioned Vestiges in a more sober tone: [...] "I should have less scruple in troubling you if <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> confidence what my work would turn out. Sometimes I think it will be good, at other times I really feel as much ashamed of myself as the author of the Vestiges ought to be of himself." ...|$|E

2500|$|Some Democratic {{critics of}} Bush {{suggested}} that the memos were produced by the Bush campaign to discredit the media's reporting on Bush's National Guard service. The chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Terry McAuliffe, {{suggested that the}} memos might have originated with long-time Bush strategist Karl Rove. McAuliffe told reporters on September 10, [...] "I {{can tell you that}} nobody at the Democratic National Committee or groups associated with us were involved in any way with these documents," [...] he said. [...] "I'm just saying that I would ask Karl Rove the same question." [...] McAuliffe later pointed out that Rove and another Republican operative, Ralph E. Reed, Jr., had [...] "a known history of dirty tricks," [...] and he asked whether Republican National Committee chairman Ed Gillespie would rule out any involvement by GOP consultant Roger Stone. At a community forum in Utica, New York in 2005, U.S. Representative Maurice Hinchey (D-NY) pointed out that the controversy served Rove's objectives: [...] "Once they did that, then it undermined everything else about Bush's draft dodging. ... That had the effect of taking the whole issue away." [...] After being criticized, Hinchey responded, [...] "I didn't allege <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> facts.

2500|$|While {{serving as}} a {{professor}} at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary, Dembski wrote The End of Christianity, which argued that a Christian can reconcile an old Earth creationist view with a literal reading of Adam and Eve in the Bible by accepting the scientific consensus of a 4.5 billion year of Earth. He further argued that Noah's flood likely was a phenomenon limited to the Middle East. This caused controversy and Dembski's reading of the Bible was criticized by Tom Nettles, a young Earth creationist, in The Southern Baptist Journal of Theology, Southern Seminary's official theological journal. In 2010, the dean of Southwestern's School of Theology, David Allen, [...] "released a White Paper through the seminary's Center for Theological Research defending Dembski as {{within the bounds of}} orthodoxy and critiquing Nettles for misunderstanding the book. The paper included Dembski's statement admitting error regarding Noah's flood." [...] Southwestern Seminary president Paige Patterson, a young Earth creationist, [...] "said that when Dembski's questionable statements came to light, he convened a meeting with Dembski and several high-ranking administrators at the seminary. At that meeting, Dembski was quick to admit that he was wrong about the flood. [...] "'Had <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>any</b> inkling that Dr. Dembski was actually denying the absolute trustworthiness of the Bible, then that would have, of course, ended his relationship with the school,' he said." ...|$|E
