50|$|Like in sludging, the {{drilling}} process is continuous: the drill bit is normally not {{removed from the}} borehole until it is finished and the broken-up material is pumped to the surface in {{the drilling}} liquid (mud).

50|$|The RR1 uses a rear {{rotary valve}} intake {{rather than a}} reed valve {{in an attempt to}} achieve more power. The engine came after the Babe Bee and looks very similar with its anodized, {{machined}} extruded aluminum crank case and fuel tank. The power improvement was negligible so Cox reverted to the cheaper easier to build Babe Bee. The engine was made for quite a few years and sold for $6.95. A left and right <b>hand</b> rotary <b>valve</b> was made, as were left hand 6x2 glass filled nylon props for the RR-1. Some versions have a blue tank, others have a clear anodized tank. There were two versions of the tank back as well, to fit the corresponding tank. It has become a collectors item due to its uniqueness and pretty colors and is worth around $300 in 2008.|$|R
40|$|The {{requirements}} of the diploma thesis consisted in building an experimentation chamber capable of producing Mars-like environmental conditions. The main focus resided in simulating {{the composition of the}} atmosphere, as well as its pressure, temperature and humidity. On the basis of this data, a regulating device was designed in order to measure and directly influence the environmental parameters. The aim of the thesis was to build a chamber which could later accommodate sample bowls with micro-organisms. Based on the products of their metabolism, one should be able to deduct whether or not micro- organisms can survive and metabolise under such extreme conditions. The main element of the Mars simulation chamber is a high-vacuum chamber, capable of accommodating the samples, and which can be evacuated via two vacuum pumps. A vacuum measurement device gauges the low pressure within the chamber and displays the results on the dials. A humidity sensor, capable of resisting vacuum conditions, registers the humidity within the chamber whereas PT- 100 resistance thermometers show the temperature. Additionally, all measurement devices are connected to a data reception card that forwards them to a controlling processor. The control software, programmed in Labview, displays the received parameters on the screen and takes over the whole pressure regulation. With the help of this control software, cyclical pressure fluctuations, consistent with those on Mars, can be programmed as well. The regulation is carried out by two electromagnetic vacuum valves that are also connected to the NI-card. The desired amount of water is introduced manually into the atmosphere using a reservoir that leads water into the system and which can be closed by a <b>hand</b> <b>valve</b> once the designated water concentration has been achieved. The temperature regulation in the Mars chamber is controlled with a programmable external cryostat, attached to a copper spiral inside the chamber that reliably forwards the appointed temperature to the experimentation chamber...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a study of}} one component two-phase flow inside horizontal tubes, with bends using refrigerant R 600 a (Isobutane) as the working fluid. Two-phase refrigerant enters the evaporator and exits as a superheated vapour. As vapour quality increases with evaporation, the vapour velocity also increases causing increased interfacial tension forces and the two-phase flow experiences different flow patterns. The phase change flow patterns {{that occur in the}} tubular evaporator, which forms part of a typical refrigeration plant, were observed recorded and discussed here. The evaporator was a 16 -row trombone shaped transparent glass coil with return bends of 180 degrees and was connected to a refrigeration unit consisting of a hermetic compressor, air-cooled condenser, liquid receiver, and finally connected to a <b>hand</b> expansion <b>valve.</b> The effect of mineral oil on the flow patterns and behaviour at the transition zone together with several photographic and recording techniques were also discussed and reported here. All pressures quoted in this paper are absolute values...|$|R
40|$|There {{is a large}} {{repertoire}} for the (French) horn yet it {{is mostly}} confined to standard tuning systems. Development of new repertoire, as demonstrated in this thesis, may assist in bringing non-standard tunings out of the margins and into the mainstream. A significant compositional resource {{is provided by the}} available harmonics of the standard double horn, 13 - 24 on each of 16 tube lengths, along with traditional techniques of lip, right <b>hand</b> and <b>valve</b> slide adjustments. The performance of compositions in extended just in tonation is discovered to be within the realm of expertise of players using standard brass instruments. A deeper understanding of the use of harmonics produced on lip vibrated instruments or labrosones is gained by classifying them according to just intonation prime-limits. The use of harmonics is therefore linked with the long and rich tradition of just intonation and other microtonal exploration. A method specifically for training horn players in extended just intonation completes this thesis...|$|R
60|$|The {{afternoon}} was wearing through, {{but it was}} still almost insufferably hot when Jefferson stood with his <b>hand</b> upon the <b>valve</b> of the Cumbria's forward winch. She lay with her bows wedged into the mangrove forest, which crawled on high-arched roots over leagues of bubbling mire to the edge of one of the foulest creeks in Western Africa. It flowed, thick and yeasty, beneath the steamer's hove-up side, for she lay with a list to starboard athwart the stream. There was a bend close by, and her original crew had apparently either failed to swing her round it, which is an accident that sometimes happens in that country, or driven her ashore to save her sinking.|$|R
40|$|There are {{two types}} of {{artificial}} heart valves, namely, (i) biological valves and (ii) mechanical valves. biological heart valves are made from tissue taken from animals or human cadavers. They are treated with preservatives and sterilized for human implantation. On the other <b>hand,</b> mechanical heart <b>valves</b> are made of man-made materials. The advantage of mechanical valves over biological valves is that they normally last for a comparatively longer lifetime. The biological valves exhibit a shorter lifetime and tend to wear out with time in service.

50|$|The {{control system}} is further {{divided into two}} service brake {{circuits}}, the parking brake circuit, and the trailer brake circuit. The dual service brake circuits are further split into front and rear wheel circuits which receive compressed air from their individual reservoirs for added safety {{in case of an}} air leak. The service brakes are applied by means of a brake pedal air valve which regulates both circuits. The parking brake is the air operated spring brake type where its applied by spring force in the spring brake cylinder and released by compressed air via <b>hand</b> control <b>valve.</b> The trailer brake consists of a direct two line system: the supply line (marked red) and the separate control or service line (marked blue). The supply line receives air from the prime mover park brake air tank via a park brake relay valve and the control line is regulated via the trailer brake relay valve. The operating signals for the relay are provided by the prime mover brake pedal air valve, trailer service brake hand control (subject to local heavy vehicle legislation) and the prime mover park brake hand control.|$|R

40|$|Ostracods {{belonging}} to the genus Bennelongia differ much in valve morphology between adults and juveniles. Adult valves are asymmetrical, characterised by a beak-like feature in the anteroventral region of the left valve, and, with some notable exceptions, mostly have smooth or weaklyornamented valves. Juvenile specimens, on the other <b>hand,</b> have <b>valves</b> that are almost symmetrical, with no beak-like feature and are often heavily ornamented. We have examined the last 3 - 4 juvenile stages of 6 Bennelongia species from 5 different lineages, in order to decipher the types of external valve ornamentation and their recurrences during ontogeny and across lineages. It is clear that ornamentation is more prevalent at the early instar stages compared to the last 2 pre-adult stages, and especially {{when compared to the}} adult stage itself. We also examined the surprising presence of a calcified inner lamella with a prominent inner list in the pre-adult stages of Bennelongia species, that is usually absent in juveniles of other ostracods, thus questioning if heterochronic processes have provided an intermediate valve morphology between the simple (normal) cypridinid juvenile state and the heavily derived and modifi ed state of adult Bennelongia. We discuss the possible (speculative) functionality of the ornamentation in juveniles...|$|R

5000|$|The 1955-up Pontiac V8 was an {{overhead}} valve engine with wedge combustion chambers. It used cast iron cylinder heads and a cast-iron block. An innovative design feature was mounting the rocker arms on ball pivots on studs set into the cylinder-head, rather than using a separate rocker shaft; this allowed more consistent valve action with less weight than a conventional shaft. It was also cheaper to build than a rocker shaft; this Pontiac-patented technology was immediately handed to the Chevrolet division for their first postwar V-8, which appeared the same year.
