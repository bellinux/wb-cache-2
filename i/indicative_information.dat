Using US data during 1996 – 2010, we observe that lower (higher) accounting quality significantly relates to higher (lower) levels of implied volatility (IV) around announcements. Worse accounting quality is further associated with a significant increase in IV before announcements, and is found to relate to a larger resolution in IV after the announcement has taken place.

Parallel web pages tend to have parallel structures,and the structural correspondence can be <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> for identifying parallel sentences. In our approach, the web page is represented as a tree, and a stochastic tree alignment model is used to exploit the structural correspondence for sentence alignment. Experiments show that this method significantly enhances alignment accuracy and robustness for parallel web pages which are much more diverse and noisy than standard parallel corpora such as “Hansard”. With improved sentence alignment performance, web mining systems are able to acquire parallel sentences of higher quality from the web. ...|$|E

In order to complete their tasks, agents need to coordinate their actions both constantly and extensively. We present an approach that consists of a standard operating procedure and a look-ahead coordination. The standard operating procedure regulates task coupling and minimizes communication. The look-ahead coordination increases agents ' global visibility and provides <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> for decision adjustment. The goal of our approach is to prune decision myopia while maintaining system responsiveness in real-time, dynamic environments.

This system integrates Bayesian and Genetic Programming (GP) classification methods in an optimized way to extract the summary sentences. The system is trainable and uses manually annotated corpus. We have introduced methods for evaluating the summary against other human summaries. Moreover, we used human judgement for system output, and finally we tested the system against a commercial Arabic summarization system...|$|E
40|$|Information {{asymmetry}} is {{a necessary}} prerequisite for testing adverse selection. This paper applies this sequence of tests to Mauritian slave auctions. Dynamic auction theory with private value highlights more aggressive bidding by uninformed bidders and higher prices when an informed participant is active. We conjecture that observable family links between buyer and seller entailed superior information and find a strong price premium when a related buyer purchased a slave, <b>indicative</b> of <b>information</b> asymmetry. We then test for adverse selection using sale motivation. Our results indicate large discounts on voluntary as compared to involuntary sales. Consistent with adverse selection, the market anticipated that predominantly lowproductivity slaves would {{be brought to the}} market in voluntary sales.

Bid-ask spreads narrow in the first trading hour because adverse selection risk fell significantly and there is less price volatility in the continuous market.

Our findings are robust for different lengths of sample period, different lengths of trading hours after market open, and stocks that had (and had not) reformed the share split structure during our research period. 33 page(s...|$|R

30|$|Apart {{from the}} {{satellite}} data, {{other sources of}} errors such as measurement errors, substantial seepage losses from the waterholes and errors due to substantial water abstraction by livestock and humans {{could also result in}} additional errors. In spite of these sources of errors, the multi-source satellite data approach presented in this study can be used to monitor relative patterns and variations in water levels as opposed to absolute depths. This approach provides <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> on relative water availability in near-real time, which otherwise is limited in the remote pastoral regions. Particularly, the use of scaled depths minimizes the negative impact of bias errors from input data and model parameterization. Due to the consistent nature of remote sensing data, the bias errors are largely eliminated from influencing the year-to-year variability of scaled depth, making it useful for drought monitoring and early warning applications.|$|E

In addition, there are indications that the unilateral incentive for governments to provide state aid – to improve the position of its exporting firms against international competitors – is still in effect in practice, despite the presence of EU state aid control aimed at reducing this unilateral incentive and pursuing the EU’s joint interest. The estimation results however provide <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> that state aid control is effective. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Failure of embryo {{implantation}} {{is a major}} {{limiting factor}} in early pregnancy and assisted reproduction. Determinants of implantation include the embryo viability, the endometrial receptivity, and embryo-maternal interactions. Multiple molecules {{are involved in the}} regulation of implantation, but their specific regulatory mechanisms remain unclear. MicroRNA (miRNA), functioning as the transcriptional regulator of gene expression, has been widely reported to be involved in embryo implantation. Recent studies reveal that miRNAs not only act inside the cells, but also can be released by cells into the extracellular environment through multiple packaging forms, facilitating intercellular communication and providing <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> associated with physiological and pathological conditions. The discovery of extracellular miRNAs shed new light on implantation studies. MiRNAs provide new mechanisms for embryo-maternal communication. Moreover, they may serve as non-invasive biomarkers for embryo selection and assessment of endometrial receptivity in assisted reproduction, which improves the accuracy of evaluation while reducing the mechanical damage to the tissue. In this review, we discuss the involvement of miRNAs in embryo implantation from several aspects, focusing on the role of extracellular miRNAs and their potential applications in assisted reproductive technologies (ART) to promote fertility efficiency...|$|E

We {{provide evidence that}} litigation and settlement announcements {{have a significant impact}} on the stock prices of sued firms, and that foreknowledge of these events may be used by insiders to earn abnormal profits. We assess both actual and proposed trades by insiders in sued firms to detect abnormal trading activity prior to these events. Our results provide strong evidence of abnormal trading activity by insiders of sued firms prior to these announcements. The direction of their trades suggests the presence of informed trading prior to both litigation and settlement announcements. Moreover, we observe that managers exhibit higher abnormal trading activity than non-managing insiders prior to litigation and settlement announcements...|$|R

30|$|Another type {{of related}} works, such as [3, 11], aim {{to find the}} {{coordinates}} of nodes in a specific Euclidean space, where the distances between nodes reflect their connection. To be more specific, if two nodes stay closer on the mapped space, they {{have a higher probability}} to influence each other, and their infection times in different cascades should be relatively closer as well. The model proposed by [3] attempts to minimize a hinge loss function by adopting Monte Carlo simulation to iteratively use stochastic gradient to adjust the coordinates of nodes. Meanwhile, [11] directly integrates the coordinates into the transmission likelihood of the NetRate and thus uses the same objective function as the optimization target. We deem such models actually do not fully solve the network inference problem: The distance between two nodes on the Euclidean space is symmetric, while the influence between them are intrinsically asymmetric. However, we think the obtained coordinates of a node can provide us <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> of the density around it, which can be potentially useful for the clustering phase of the proposed P-CENI model. Therefore, we adopt the approach in [3] as a prerequisite step for the clustering of P-CENI due to its efficiency and effectiveness.|$|E
30|$|In {{a typical}} B-scan GPR image, the scatterers within the image region {{show up as}} a {{hyperbolic}} curves because of the different trip times of the EM wave while the antenna is moving along the scanning direction. Such an image construction may be sufficient when the aim is only to detect the targets. In most situations, however, the <b>indicative</b> <b>information</b> about the location, shape {{and size of the}} targets is required [1, 3]. Therefore, one of the most applied problem for the B-scan GPR image is to transform (or to migrate) the unfocused space–time GPR image to a focused one showing the object’s true location and size with corresponding EM reflectivity. The common name for this process is called migration or focusing [3, 4]. The migration methods were primarily developed for processing seismic images [5] and have been widely used for the focusing of GPR data because of the similarities between the acoustic and the electromagnetic wave equations [4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12]. Various focusing or migration techniques have been developed to increase the spatial resolution of GPR images. These are; diffraction summation [12], Kirchhoff wave-equation migration [11], phase-shift migration [7, 9], and frequency-wave number (F-K) migration [6, 8].|$|E
