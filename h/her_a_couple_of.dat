25|$|Clinton {{took the}} oath of office of Secretary of State. Just before being sworn in as Secretary of State, Clinton {{resigned}} her senate seat effective just hours before her oath as Secretary of State. She became the first former First Lady to serve in the United States Cabinet. She also became the first Secretary of State to have previously been an elected official since Edmund Muskie's less-than-a-year stint in 1980, with Christian Herter during the Eisenhower administration being the last one before that. In being selected by her formal rival Obama, she became only the fourth person in the preceding hundred years to join the cabinet of someone they had run against for their party's presidential nomination that election year (Jack Kemp ran against and was later chosen by George H. W. Bush to be Secretary of HUD in 1988, George W. Romney by Richard Nixon for Secretary of HUD in 1968, and Philander Knox by William Howard Taft for Secretary of State in 1908 preceded her; Obama's pick of Tom Vilsack for Secretary of Agriculture followed <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> weeks later to be the next such person).|$|E
2500|$|Wolverine {{appears to}} have {{remained}} out of service until and possibly after January 25, 1916, when {{it was reported that}} the boat was [...] "tied up". [...] On that date, Capt. Willard was reported to have [...] "got the Wolverine in shape and ran <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days." [...] Willard was also reported {{at the same time to}} be running Wolverine on the river in competition with another line.|$|E

6000|$|... “Yes, I think so. We {{could build}} her of one-and-a-half-inch planks, fill the seams well with oakum, and give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> coats of paint. Let her be of shallow draft {{with plenty of}} beam. She should, of course, be decked over, as she might meet with another tornado. The crew would consist of an officer and ten men. With such a vessel {{there should be no}} {{difficulty}} in reaching Port Royal.” ...|$|E
60|$|Rebecca, {{to do her}} justice, {{never would}} let either of these men remain alone with Amelia; the Major was {{disengaged}} too, and swore {{he would be the}} winner of <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> ruffians were fighting for this innocent creature, gambling for her at her own table, and though she was not aware of the rascals' designs upon her, yet she felt a horror and uneasiness in their presence and longed to fly.|$|E

60|$|In a {{few minutes}} Frank {{disappeared}} among the rocks upon the shore; and Maximus, taking Edith by the hand, and dragging her sledge after him, led <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred yards out on to the ice, or, more properly speaking, the hard beaten snow with which the ice was covered. Chimo had been turned loose, and, being rather tired after his journey, had coiled himself up on a mound of snow and fallen fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|Something {{happy and}} easy, {{something}} above all unconscious, {{in the way}} he said this, brought home again to his companion the facility of his attitude and the enviability of his state. [...] "See her then by all means. And consider too," [...] Strether went on, [...] "that you really give your sister a lift in letting her come to you. You give <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> months of Paris, which she hasn't seen, if I'm not mistaken, since just after she was married, and which I'm sure she wants but the pretext to visit." ...|$|E
60|$|He {{scrambled}} {{towards the}} bowsprit, which, having lost its principal support, swayed upward, in peril of being torn {{away by the}} sagging jib. Vane, who first rounded up the boat into the wind, followed him; and for several minutes they had a struggle with the madly-flapping sail, before they flung it, bundled up, into the well. Then they ran in the bowsprit, and Vane felt glad that, although the craft had been rigged in the usual Western fashion, he had changed that by giving <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> headsails in place of one.|$|E
6000|$|... "You won't see <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days," [...] Captain West told me. [...] "Her {{mother was}} the same way--a born sailor, but always sick {{at the outset of}} a voyage." ...|$|R

60|$|He {{scrambled}} {{toward the}} bowsprit, which having lost its principal support swayed upward, in peril of being torn {{away by the}} sagging jib.

60|$|Well, {{meanwhile}} Becky was {{the greatest}} comfort and convenience to her, and she gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> new gowns, and an old necklace and shawl, and showed her friendship by abusing all her intimate acquaintances to her new confidante (than which there can't be a more touching proof of regard), and meditated vaguely some great future benefit--to marry her perhaps to Clump, the apothecary, or to settle her in some advantageous way of life; or at any rate, to send her back to Queen's Crawley when she had done with her, and the full London season had begun.|$|E
60|$|We {{agreed to}} that, but I said I thought {{we ought to}} go and take one more look at our old queen before we left. Mrs. Chipperton, who was a really {{sensible}} woman when she had a chance, objected to this, because, she said, {{it would be better to}} let the old woman alone now. We couldn't do anything for her after we left, and it would be better to let her depend on her own exertions, now that she had got started again on that track. I didn't think that the word exertion was a very good one in Poqua-dilla's case, but I didn't argue the matter. I thought that if some of us dropped around there before we left, and gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> shillings, it would not interfere much with her mercantile success in the future.|$|E

6000|$|... "That is something, at any rate, George," [...] he went on, {{as the man}} was rowed away. [...] "The whole {{proceeding}} is a {{very strange}} one, {{and you see the}} description of the man with Carthew exactly answers to that of the man who found out from the boat's crew that Dr. Maddison was attending Lady Greendale; and now you see that {{it is quite possible that}} the Phantom is somewhere near, or was somewhere near yesterday afternoon. Carthew may have hired a foreign crew, and sailed in <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> days after her own crew came over; or he may have hired another craft either abroad or here. At any rate, there is something to do. I will go up to town by the midday train, and then down to Dover, and cross to Ostend tonight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No. 1 torpedo {{was seen}} and heard to strike her just before {{foremost}} funnel: smoke and débris appeared to {{go as high as}} masthead." [...] That much E9 saw before one of the guardian destroyers ran at her. [...] "So," [...] says she, [...] "observing her I took my periscope off the battleship." [...] This was excusable, as the destroyer was coming up with intent to kill and E9 had to flood her tanks and get down quickly. Even so, the destroyer only just missed her, and she struck bottom in 43 feet. [...] "But," [...] says E9, who, if she could not see, kept her ears open, [...] "at the correct interval (the 45 or 50 seconds mentioned in the previous case) the second torpedo was heard to explode, though not actually seen." [...] E9 came up twenty minutes later to make sure. The destroyer was waiting for <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hundred yards away, and again E9 dipped for the life, but [...] "just had time to see one large vessel approximately four or five miles away." ...|$|E
6000|$|It had tamed {{him a good}} deal. Smallbones {{said the}} letting out of malapert blood was wholesome, and others thought him still under a spell; {{but he seemed to}} have parted with much of his arrogance, either because he had not spirits for self-assertion, or because {{something}} of the grand eastern courtesy of Abenali had impressed him. For intercourse with the Morisco had by no means ceased. Giles went, as long as the injury required it, to have the hurt dressed, and loitered in the Inner Yard a long time every day, often securing some small dainty for Aldonza--an apple, a honey cake, a bit of marchpane, a dried plum, or a comfit. One day he took <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> oranges. To his surprise, as he entered, Abenali looked up with a strange light in his eyes, and exclaimed, [...] "My son! thy scent is to my nostrils as the court of my father's house!" [...] Then, as he beheld the orange, he clasped his hands, took it in them, and held it to his breast, pouring out a chant in an unknown tongue, while the tears flowed down his cheeks.|$|E

6000|$|This {{discourse}} {{introduced a}} topic {{upon which the}} two travellers, though so different in rank and education, found each a good deal to say. The Duke, besides his other patriotic qualities, was a distinguished agriculturist, and proud of his knowledge in that department. He entertained Jeanie with his observations on the different breeds of cattle in Scotland, and their capacity for the dairy, and received so much information from her practical experience in return, that he promised <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> Devonshire cows in reward for the lesson. In short his mind was so transported back to his rural employments and amusements, that he sighed when his carriage stopped opposite to the old hackney-coach, which Archibald had kept in attendance {{at the place where}} they had left it. While the coachman again bridled his lean cattle, which had been indulged with a bite of musty hay, the Duke cautioned Jeanie not to be too communicative to her landlady concerning what had passed. [...] "There is," [...] he said, [...] "no use of speaking of matters till they are actually settled; and you may refer the good lady to Archibald, if she presses you hard with questions. She is his old acquaintance, and he knows how to manage with her." ...|$|E
6000|$|It {{looked a}} {{promising}} plot. Seven {{members of the}} Autolycus Club gallantly undertook to accompany [...] "Miss Bulstrode" [...] to her lodgings. Jack Herring excited jealousy by securing the privilege of carrying her reticule. [...] "Miss Bulstrode" [...] was given to understand that anything any of the seven could do for her, each and every would be delighted to do, if only {{for the sake of}} her brother, one of the dearest boys that ever breathed--a bit of an ass, though that, of course, he could not help. [...] "Miss Bulstrode" [...] was not as grateful as perhaps she should have been. Her idea still was that if one of them would lend <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> sovereigns, the rest need not worry themselves further. This, purely in her own interests, they declined to do. She had suffered one extensive robbery that day already, as Jack reminded her. London was a city of danger to the young and inexperienced. Far better that they should watch over her and provide for her simple wants. Painful as it was to refuse a lady, a beloved companion's sister's welfare was yet dearer to them. [...] "Miss Bulstrode's" [...] only desire was not to waste their time. Jack Herring's opinion was that there existed no true Englishman who would grudge time spent upon succouring a beautiful maiden in distress.|$|E
60|$|In {{the course}} of the day Newman {{received}} three lines from him, saying that it had been decided that he should cross the frontier, with his adversary, and that he was to take the night express to Geneva. He should have time, however, to dine with Newman. In the afternoon Newman called upon Madame de Cintre, but his visit was brief. She was as gracious and sympathetic as he had ever found her, but she was sad, and she confessed, on Newman's charging her with her red eyes, that she had been crying. Valentin had been with <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>couple</b> <b>of</b> hours before, and his visit had left her with a painful impression. He had laughed and gossiped, he had brought her no bad news, he had only been, in his manner, rather more affectionate than usual. His fraternal tenderness had touched her, and on his departure she had burst into tears. She had felt as if something strange and sad were going to happen; she had tried to reason away the fancy, and the effort had only given her a headache. Newman, of course, was perforce tongue-tied about Valentin's projected duel, and his dramatic talent was not equal to satirizing Madame de Cintre's presentiment as pointedly as perfect security demanded. Before he went away he asked Madame de Cintre whether Valentin had seen his mother.|$|E
