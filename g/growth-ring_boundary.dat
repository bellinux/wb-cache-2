30|$|The greater {{incidence}} of Type 1 resin pockets {{in the lower}} part of the stems is consistent with the distribution of bending and axial stress in the stems. When stems bend in the wind, the maximum bending and axial stress occurs at the outer surface, close to the cambium, in {{the lower part of}} the stem (Mergen, 1954; Petty & Worrell, 1981; Morgan & Cannell, 1994; Chiba, 2000). The axial stress on the compression side of the bend, can lead to failure along the lamellate structures of the growth rings. In Norway spruce, tangential splits were produced by axial compressive stress, usually in the early wood along the growth ring boundary (Bariska & Kuƒçera, 1985). The increase in the number of Type 1 resin pockets with stem bending in the radiata pine trees, occurred in the early wood of the outer growth-ring, and close to the <b>growth-ring</b> <b>boundary.</b>|$|E
30|$|The {{presence}} of Type 1 resin pockets {{in the early}} wood of trees subjected to the stem bending treatments applied here, suggests that Type 1 resin pockets were forming in the mature wood, behind the cambium and zone of differentiation, as observed by Donaldson (1983). The early wood that {{is close to the}} <b>growth-ring</b> <b>boundary</b> {{appears to have been a}} zone of weakness for the formation of Type 1 resin pockets, and will have contained fully differentiated mature wood at the time of the spring and summer stem bending treatments. The structural properties of the mature wood will not be affected by either the water status of the trees, or the timing of the stem bending during the growth season. This situation could explain the similar number of Type 1 resin pockets formed when the trees were water-stressed compared with trees that were water stressed then rehydrated.|$|E
40|$|The {{phenomenon}} of distinct, absent or indistinct growth rings {{is a highly}} variable feature used for wood identification and {{a wide range of}} tree-ring studies. Causes for its variability are not yet fully understood. There is also a lack of consensus within the scientific community about how distinct and indistinct tree rings should be defined and classified. We use a selection of 103 Central African rainforest trees to analyse the anatomy of <b>growth-ring</b> <b>boundaries</b> of 103 Central African rainforest species and assessed the influence of the climate, tree organ and leaf shedding behaviour on growth-ring distinctness and anatomy. We observed a high variability of tree-ring boundaries anatomy and distinctness within and among individuals and species. Although, for some semi-deciduous species, higher incidence of distinct growth rings appears to be related with a more pronounced seasonal climate, no general trends are observed for the assembly of studied species. Growth rings are variable within individuals depending on the considered organ: trunks tend to show more distinct rings than branches. Growth-ring distinctness is difficult to implement as a trait to measure tree performance when only based on abrupt changes in fibre size and cell wall thickness. From the potential growth-ring markers identified in the IAWA list of hardwood features, those applying to vessel and parenchyma density and distended rays appear to be more useful in tropical trees than abruptly flattened latewood fibres or abrupt changes in vessel diameter.
