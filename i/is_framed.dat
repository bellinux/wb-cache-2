5|$|The nude {{female figure}} is realistically sculpted in high-relief.

Her full lips are slightly upturned at the corners. She is adorned with a four-tiered headdress of horns, topped by a disk.

5|$|The woman's {{left ear}} is set, {{according}} to art historian Norbert Schneider, unnaturally high and far back, parallel {{to her eyes}} rather than to her nose; this position is probably an artistic device used to continue {{the flow of the}} diagonal line of the veil's inner-right wing. In the 15th century, veils were normally worn for modesty, to hide the sensuality of the flesh.

5|$|Although {{depicted}} {{with the}} tower in a Rand McNally map from 1893, later lithographs {{of the first}} 141 Jackson Street location display a red-roofed building without a tower. Memorabilia of the current building is abundant, with postcards of panoramic scenes from LaSalle Street, the clock, and lighted upper decks having been produced for decades. In views from the Museum Campus, the building's crown <b>is</b> <b>framed</b> by the middle floors of the taller Sears Tower in the background. Photographer Andreas Gursky has used the location for still life prints such as 1997's Chicago Board of Trade, I and 1999's Chicago Board of Trade, II.

5|$|In 1993, Lundgren starred {{opposite}} Kristian Alfonso and George Segal in Joshua Tree, {{directed by}} Academy Award and BAFTA-winning stunt coordinator Vic Armstrong. Lundgren plays Wellman Anthony Santee, a former racecar driver who {{has turned to}} hauling exotic stolen cars with his friend Eddie Turner (Ken Foree). One day he <b>is</b> <b>framed</b> by police officer Frank Severance (Segal) {{for the murder of}} a highway patrolman, also killing his friend Eddie. Santee is sent to prison after recovering in a prison hospital, but escapes during transfer and takes a female hostage named Rita Marrick (Alfonso) at a gas station, not suspecting that she's a cop. On the run from the law, involving exotic cars and desert scenery, Santee must prove his innocence and prove Severance guilty of being involved in the car ring and for murder. Much of the film was filmed in the Alabama Hills of the Sierra Nevada and the desert of the Joshua Tree National Park of southeast California.|$|E
5|$|Other {{similarities}} include {{engaging in}} the suspense the speaker is attempting to create. In both scenarios, you must put aside {{the knowledge that the}} performers know the outcome of the event being relayed and, in a sense, play along. This is integral to his stance as he explains “the argument that much of talk consists of replayings and that these make no sense unless some form of storyteller's suspense can be maintained shows the close relevance of frame-indeed, the close relevance of dramaturgy-for the organization of talk.” Lastly, because the replaying of strips is not extemporaneous, but rather preformulated, it is yet another parallel between a stage production and conversation. All of these things work in concert to provide a foundation of how talk <b>is</b> <b>framed.</b>|$|E

40|$|The 2016 presidential {{election}} in USA was extraordinary from several point of views and the election was majorly covered by swedish media. The aim {{of this research was}} to examine how Swedish newspapers portrayed Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump from a gender perspective during the 2016 {{presidential election}}. We also wanted to analyse how other common political news <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> used to portray Clinton and Trump.   This <b>is</b> a qualitative <b>framing</b> analysis of 14 strategically selected articles, seven that were published by Aftonbladet and seven by Dagens Nyheter. The results showed tendencies of several gendered stereotypes that are being retained by the frames the newspapers use. Frames such as gendered traits and gendered issue emphases, but also game <b>frames</b> <b>were</b> offered to the reader.   We discovered that Aftonbladet and Dagens Nyheter offered a more positive opinion of Clinton than of Trump. While Clinton <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> as an experienced, emotional and compassionate candidate, Trump <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> as an inexperienced, insensitive and aggressive candidate. Clinton <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> with gendered issue emphases in both the public and private sphere, while Trump <b>was</b> <b>framed</b> with gendered issue emphases in only the public sphere. Furthermore, game frames showed that the newspapers had a tendency of polarizing and personifying the candidates...|$|R
