500|$|At 3:20p.m., the {{screwdriver}} {{slipped and}} the upper beryllium hemisphere fell, causing a [...] "prompt critical" [...] reaction and a burst of hard radiation. At the time, the scientists in the room observed the blue glow of air ionization and felt a heat wave. Slotin experienced a sour taste {{in his mouth and}} an intense burning sensation in his left hand. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> his left hand upward, lifting the upper beryllium hemisphere and dropping it to the floor, ending the reaction. However, he had already been exposed to a lethal dose of neutron radiation. At the time of the accident, dosimetry badges were in a locked box about [...] from the accident. Realizing {{that no one in the}} room had their film badges on, [...] "immediately after the accident Dr. Slotin asked to have the badges taken from the lead box and placed on the critical assembly". This peculiar response was attributed to [...] "vertigo" [...] and was of no value for determining the actual doses received by the men in the room.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> {{his elbow}} to the south-east--the {{direction}} of the Quiet Woman.|$|E
60|$|Seizing the rope, <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> it violently in {{the first}} effort of mounting.|$|E
6000|$|... (<b>He</b> <b>jerks</b> the rope. The assistants leap at the victim's {{legs and}} drag him downward, {{grunting}} the croppy boy's tongue protrudes violently.) ...|$|R
5000|$|... 5. This time, the Coyote uses {{dynamite}} on {{a fishing}} line. When he hears the Road Runner, <b>he</b> <b>jerks</b> back the rod and prepares to cast the line. <b>He</b> <b>jerks</b> a bit too hard, however; the dynamite gets stuck in a cactus, and eventually, the Coyote gets wound around the cactus with the line. He then sees that the dynamite {{is about to go}} off, and tries to blow out the fuse, but instead makes it wear out faster, and it then explodes.|$|R
6000|$|VIRAG: (Agueshaken, profuse yellow spawn foaming {{over his}} bony epileptic lips) She sold lovephiltres, whitewax, orangeflower. Panther, the Roman centurion, {{polluted}} {{her with his}} genitories. (He sticks out a flickering phosphorescent scorpion tongue, {{his hand on his}} fork) Messiah! He burst her tympanum. (With gibbering baboon's cries <b>he</b> <b>jerks</b> his hips in the cynical spasm) Hik! Hek! Hak! Hok! Huk! Kok! Kuk! ...|$|R
60|$|With one {{powerful}} lunge <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> Hardman {{back and}} flung him sprawling into the dust.|$|E
60|$|The {{positive}} refusal {{expressed in}} Mr Pancks's continued snorts, {{no less than}} in these exclamations, to entertain the sentiment for a single instant, drove Arthur away from it. Indeed, he was fearful of something happening to Mr Pancks in the violent conflict that took place between the breath <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> out of himself and the smoke <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> into himself. This abandonment of the second topic threw him on the third.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Moss paused, {{with his}} glass halfway to his lips. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> {{his head in}} the {{direction}} of Mr. Parker.|$|E
6000|$|... "Another tap. Now {{see that}} comb {{on the top}} of his head; you {{scarcely}} noticed it before, and now it is bright red. And see his spurs beginning to show--on good thick legs, too. There is a fine young fellow for you! Look how <b>he</b> <b>jerks</b> his head from side to side, like the young prince of a poultry-yard, as he well deserves to be!" ...|$|R
60|$|Then, {{before the}} wretches {{realised}} his intention, <b>he</b> had <b>jerked</b> himself free {{from them and}} run to Esther.|$|R
60|$|But {{before he}} could say more <b>he</b> was <b>jerked</b> {{backward}} and sent flying out-of the car into the darkness.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thin {{his hand}} shot out an' grabbed Durade.... <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> {{him off his}} feet an' swung him round. The little derringer flew, an' Sandy McDermott wuz the mon who picked it up. It'll be Neale's whin I see him.... Durade jabbered fer help. But no wan come. Thot big trapper Slingerland stood there with two guns, an' shure he looked bad. Neale slung Durade around, spillin' some fellars who didn't dodge quick, an' thin <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> him up backwards.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> at {{the drawer}} in his excitement. It fell, cut sharply on his shin, {{and on the}} reflex he flung it at her.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> {{his thumb}} in the {{direction}} of Miss Pilbeam and winked with slow deliberation. [...] "She'll be there, too," [...] he added. [...] "Savvy?" ...|$|E
60|$|At {{ten minutes}} to four <b>he</b> sternly <b>jerked</b> on his coat and walked far north of Ninety-second Street, then back.|$|R
6000|$|... "Allemachter!" [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>jerking</b> his pony round. [...] "It's you, Missie Jess, is it? Now {{who would}} have thought of seeing you here?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Who do you think,' said Riderhood, with a hitch of his head, as if <b>he</b> disdainfully <b>jerked</b> the feint away, 'picked up the body? Guess.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> himself about, {{after this}} compliment, {{in such an}} {{intolerable}} manner, that my aunt, who had sat looking straight at him, lost all patience.|$|E
6000|$|... "There’s no old age for me," [...] he said, sadly; [...] "but you needn’t tell them," [...] and <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> {{his thumb}} towards the forecastle.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> at {{the middle}} bar, and the next moment he was {{standing}} with it in his hand, {{and the way to}} the garden was clear.|$|E
6000|$|... "All gettee out," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>jerking</b> {{his thumb}} in the {{direction}} of the court of mystery. [...] "Eleven devils. Plenty soon come bung'low. What do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That man," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>jerking</b> a {{backward}} thumb at the closed door, [...] "lives or dies, goes free or hangs, as you shall decide, Hortensia." ...|$|R
6000|$|A swarthy boy {{opened a}} book and propped it nimbly under the breastwork of his satchel. <b>He</b> recited <b>jerks</b> of verse with odd glances at the text: ...|$|R
60|$|But John William had a soul above tumbles. In {{an instant}} <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> {{himself up to}} his feet, dropped the pole, and dashed after the sled.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> away, {{as if he}} {{expected}} to be struck. [...] "Girl--I--I"--he gasped in amaze and sudden-dawning contrition--"I kissed you--but I swear it wasn't intentional--I never thought...." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I mean. Why are you here, {{you and that}} {{red-headed}} devil, Spike Mullins?" [...] <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> {{his head in the}} direction of the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "W'y not?" [...] growled Wilson. [...] "Ain't we gotta live? He's dead," [...] <b>he</b> added, <b>jerking</b> {{his thumb}} in the {{direction}} of the corpse. [...] "He won't care." ...|$|R
60|$|As <b>he</b> expressively <b>jerked</b> his {{pointing}} {{finger in}} the direction the boat had taken, a flush of impatience mounted into Bradley's face, and he looked anxiously up the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now it's come!" [...] said [...] .007, as {{he yelled}} aloud, and slid like a sleigh. For {{the moment he}} fancied that <b>he</b> would <b>jerk</b> bodily from off his underpinning.|$|R
60|$|Harry {{gave one}} bound. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> on his clothes quicker {{than you could}} say the {{multiplication}} table, and he rushed down stairs and into the front yard.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Hello!' he said, as we appeared. <b>He</b> <b>jerked</b> a thumb {{towards the}} classroom. 'I've locked dem in. What's doin', Buck?' he asked, {{indicating}} {{me with a}} languid nod.|$|E
6000|$|... "Depends {{what you}} take the world to mean. Do you mean us in this box, or the crew outside there?" [...] <b>he</b> <b>jerked</b> his head towards the auditorium.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Why, certainly,' <b>he</b> replied, <b>jerking</b> {{his hand}} towards the cab. 'But we mustn't start right here. This thing {{has got to}} be kept dark, don't you see, till the last day.' ...|$|R
60|$|He {{started to}} turn, {{but before he}} could do so he {{received}} a blow on the head from a club that staggered him. Then <b>he</b> was <b>jerked</b> backward to the floor.|$|R
60|$|Miss Hobson {{received}} the information {{with a laugh}} of such exceeding bitterness that strong men blanched and Mr. Cracknell started so convulsively that <b>he</b> nearly <b>jerked</b> his collar off its stud.|$|R
