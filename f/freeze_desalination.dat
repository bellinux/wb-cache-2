Nowadays the total {{liquefied}} natural gas (LNG) production capacity has reached 290 Megatons per year. Its enormous cold energy released from re-gasification {{can be used in}} the <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination</b> process to minimize the overall energy consumption. A process of FD on flake ice maker utilizing LNG cold energy was designed and simulated by HYSYS software. An ice bucket on flake ice maker was chosen as seawater crystallizer mainly due to its continuous ice making and removing ice without heat source. A dynamic model of the freezing section has been developed and simulated through gPROMS software. The results show that the consumption of 1 kg equivalent LNG cold energy can obtain about 2 kg of ice melt water. In addition, it is shown that the power consumption of this LNG/FD hybrid process is negligible...|$|E
40|$|To {{offer for}} potable water shortages, sea water {{desalination}} {{is a potential}} solution for the global rising demand for fresh water. The {{latent heat of fusion}} is about one-seventh the latent heat of vaporisation, thus indicating the benefit of lower energy consumption for the <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination</b> process. Limited literature is reported on computational fluid dynamics (CFD) on <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination.</b> Therefore, analysing and investigating thermodynamic processes are easily conducted by the powerful tool of CFD. A single unit of ice formation in an ice maker machine was modelled using ANSYS Fluent software three-dimensionally. Energy, species transport and solidification/melting modules were used in building the CFD model. Parametric analysis was conducted using the established CFD model to predict the effects of freezing temperature and the geometry of the ice maker machine; on ice production and the freezing time. Lower freezing temperatures allowed more ice production and faster freezing. Increasing the diameter and the length of the freezing tube enabled more ice to be produced...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aid of}} {{cold energy}} from {{regasification}} of liquefied natural gas (LNG), <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination</b> (FD) is an emerging technology for seawater desalination because of its low energy characteristics and insensitivities to fouling problems. This work aims to investigate the major operating parameters of FD such as coolant temperature, freezing duration, supercooling, seeding, agitation, crystallizer material and subsequent washing procedure on ice production and water quality. It {{was found that the}} optimal freezing duration per batch was 1 h for an iron crystallizer and 1. 5 h for a glass crystallizer. The optimal coolant temperature should be around − 8 °C. The optimal amount of washing water to clean the raw ice was about 50 wt% of the raw ice. Over 50 wt% of the feed could be recovered as raw ice within 1 h, which means an overall ice recovery rate of higher than 25 % (of the original seawater), considering the consumption of washing water. Both artificial and real seawater were tested under the optimized conditions. The total dissolved solid in the product ice was around 300 ppm, which met the World Health Organization (WHO) potable water salinity standard of 500 ppm. Therefore, the process parameters optimized in this study can be directly used for the <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination</b> of seawater...|$|E
40|$|Department of Urban and Environmental Engineering(Environmental Science and Engineering) There are {{a variety}} of methods for {{seawater}} desalination, and seawater desalination method through ice-freezing also exists. This study discusses <b>freezing</b> <b>desalination</b> as a new method to combine direct contact freezing and indirect contact freezing. It is the first method as well to generate ices by utilizing CO 2 Hydrate itself as refrigerant. This study explores HBID (Hydrate Based Ice Desalination) process. In HBID process, hydrate dissociation energy is used for cooling down water temperature and finally making ice. There are three factors freezing energy of HBID system. Joule-Thomson Effect, endothermic energy of carbon dioxide emission and endothermic energy of hydrate dissociation. The endothermic energy of hydrate dissociation is most dominant proposition as the major freezing energy of HBID system among the three factors. TheHBID process rejection efficiency increased as the NaClconcentration of feed water increased. However, when the NaCl concentration of feed water decreased the produced water quantitydecreased. In case of 10, 20 and 50 ppm humic acid solution treatment, the rejection is above 70 %.. HBID process is not significantly influenced by impurities such as the concentration of ion or organic matters,It has huge advantage to be utilized as the preconditioning process of membrane separation when treating high salinity waste water such as RO brineand Shale gas drawback water. In the case of cation analysis every cation rejection is higer than 50 %. It also have more than 50 % of performance in treatment efficiency of B 3 + with the highest difficulties in treatment so they can be easily utilized in the front side of RO. Therefore, the development of HBID technology can be utilized alone in the process of seawater desalination or waste water treatment to contribute to generating pure water and decreasing the volume of waste water such as RO brine. clos...|$|R

40|$|In this study, <b>freeze</b> <b>desalination</b> which {{utilizes}} CO 2 {{gas hydrate}} {{itself as a}} refrigerant (referred to as Hydrate-induced Ice Desalination, HIID) was systematically investigated and evaluated as a pretreatment method for seawater reverse osmosis (RO) process. To {{the best of the}} authors' knowledge, the HIID is the first approach to use the hydrate dissociation energy to freeze seawater in an instant for desalination. The endothermic energy related to hydrate dissociation was the most dominant factor in the freezing of seawater. Using the HIID technique, the rejection of ions with 3. 5 wt% NaCl was about 67 %. Increasing the concentration of salts enhanced rejection of component ions. However, humic acid organic rejection decreased due to agglomeration of organics in presence of salts. The HIID process showed similar levels of cation rejections-approximately 65 % of seawater, except boron and potassium. The rejection of cations might be determined by the solubility of salts at various brine concentration. Using HIID as a pretreatment of seawater at 225 psi, the RO process showed ~ 14 LMH and about 99 % cation rejections except boron. This study shows that HIID can be utilized as a pretreatment of seawater desalination and further development might make HBID technology run on its own. clos...|$|E
