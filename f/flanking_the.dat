5|$|Warner {{had both}} halfbacks {{close to the}} line and <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> {{defensive}} tackles. That {{was the start of}} the double wingback offense, which enjoyed tremendous popularity until the T formation was modernized with the man in motion. The double wing became the most effective of all systems for effective forward passing since it permitted the quick release of four receivers down the field.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the middle}} bailey was the inner bailey. The {{gatehouse}} {{from the middle}} to the inner-bailey {{was one of the}} earliest examples of towers <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> entrance to remove the blind-spot immediately in front of the gate. This was part of a wider trend from around the late 12th or 13th century onwards for castle gateways to be strongly defended.|$|E
5|$|Altar 13 {{is another}} early Maya {{monument}} {{dating to the}} Late Preclassic. Like Altar12 it was probably originally erected as a vertical stela. At some point it was deliberately broken, with severe damage inflicted upon the main portion of the sculpture, obliterating the central and lower portions. At a later date it was reused as a horizontal altar. The remains of two figures can be seen <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> damage lower portion of the monument and the large head of the sacred bird survives above the area of damage. The right hand figure is wearing an interwoven skirt and is probably female.|$|E
50|$|The {{house is}} an early example of one laid out with a center passage. A parlor (or master bedchamber) and hall <b>flank</b> <b>the</b> passage on the ground floor. Two {{chambers}} <b>flank</b> <b>the</b> passage in the attic. A frame wing was added in the late 19th century.|$|R
5000|$|For {{a three-week}} period {{following}} the unexpected development of trench warfare, both sides gave up frontal assaults and {{began trying to}} envelop each other's northern <b>flank.</b> <b>The</b> period is called [...] "Race to the Sea". As the Germans aimed for <b>the</b> Allied left <b>flank,</b> <b>the</b> Allies sought the German right wing.|$|R
50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the battle, Lord des Cordes forced back the knights within the left infantry square and also captured the Burgundian artillery drawn up on that <b>flank.</b> <b>The</b> Archduke's left <b>flank</b> was in a perilous state. In addition to being attacked from the front, it was also drawing fire on its <b>flank</b> from <b>the</b> captured artillery. However, instead of following up their advantage on <b>the</b> left <b>flank,</b> <b>the</b> French knights on the left chased after the Burgundian knights who were fleeing from the field, thereby giving up their advantage. Meanwhile, on <b>the</b> other <b>flank</b> <b>the</b> Burgundians held fast and slowly fought their way forward. It was there that victory was achieved.|$|R
5|$|As noted, {{there is}} bonebed {{evidence}} that this genus lived in groups during {{at least part of}} the year. Additionally, it had several potential methods for display in a social setting. The bony facial crest is an obvious candidate, and nasal diverticula may also have been present. These postulated diverticula would have taken the form of inflatable soft-tissue sacs housed in the deep excavations <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> crest and elongate holes for the nostrils. Such sacs could be used for both visual and auditory signals.|$|E
5|$|Choding Khang is the hermitage {{located just}} behind the Great Assembly Hall (on the hill slope of Sera Utse). This is where Je Tsongkhapa meditated. The hermitage is {{accessed}} through a track where painted rock carvings of Tsongkhapa, Jamchen and Dharma Raja (the protector) are seen <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> stepped approaches, along the route. A new building has been constructed {{in place of the}} old hermitage, which was destroyed during the Revolution. Below the hermitage are the Upper Tantric College (Gyuto) and Lower Tantric College (Gyu-me) of Lhasa). A further climb up the hill leads to caves where Tsongkhapa meditated.|$|E
5|$|Ney now had two problems: he {{expected}} support columns from Soult's division on both flanks to arrive momentarily {{and he did}} not know that the Austrians had arrived in force, directly in front of his center. Although Roget's brigade was strong enough to prevent the Austrians from <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> position, Gazan's brigade was too weak to resist the superior Austrian force, which was growing visibly stronger as Hotze's troops continued to arrive at the forward line and throw themselves into the fray.|$|E

25|$|The 'L' shaped ambush {{could also}} provide its own <b>flank</b> security. <b>The</b> {{base of the}} 'L' might be placed along either <b>flank</b> of <b>the</b> ambush position, not to fire into the kill zone, but to ambush enemy units that were {{attempting}} to <b>flank</b> <b>the</b> main ambush position along obvious avenues of approach.|$|R
5|$|Stela 2 is a {{monument}} {{in the early}} Maya style that is inscribed with a damaged Long Count date. Due to its only partial preservation, this date has at least three possible readings, the latest of which would place it in the 1st century BC. <b>Flanking</b> <b>the</b> text are two standing figures facing each other, the sculpture probably represents one ruler receiving power from his predecessor. Above the figures and the text is an ornate figure depicted in profile {{looking down at the}} left-hand figure below. Stela2 is located in front of the retaining wall of Terrace5.|$|E
5|$|The Ballcourt is {{immediately}} {{north of the}} Court of the Hieroglyphic Stairway and is {{to the south of}} the Monument Plaza. It was remodeled by Uaxaclajuun Ub'aah K'awiil, who then demolished it and built a third version, {{which was one of the}} largest from the Classic period. It was dedicated to the great macaw deity and the buildings <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> playing area carried 16 mosaic sculptures of the birds. The completion date of the ballcourt is inscribed with a hieroglyphic text upon the sloping playing area and is given as 6January 738.|$|E
5|$|The Medway long barrows all {{conformed}} {{to the same}} general design plan, and are all aligned on an east to west axis. Each had a stone chamber at {{the eastern end of}} the mound, and they each probably had a stone facade <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> entrance. The chambers were constructed from sarsen, a dense, hard, and durable stone that occurs naturally throughout Kent, having formed out of silicified sand from the Eocene epoch. Early Neolithic builders would have selected blocks from the local area, and then transported them {{to the site of the}} monument to be erected.|$|E

5|$|The NK 2nd Division {{pushed forward}} {{in spite of}} the casualties, and that {{afternoon}} elements of it were <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> 27th Infantry's main position. Michaelis issued an order about 22:00 for another withdrawal to high ground near Hwanggan. The withdrawal started near midnight with heavy fighting still in progress on the right flank. Murch took control of all nine US tanks and put them on line facing north, where they attacked North Korean troops approaching on the road. Mortar fire fell along the battalion line and the road behind it. F Company and the nine tanks covered the 2nd Battalion withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|The Puerta de Palmas {{was built}} in 1551. It has two {{cylindrical}} towers <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> entrance door. Prince Philip II and Emperor Charles V and date of construction are mentioned on the outer side of the tower. The towers are fortified with battlements and they have two decorative cords {{at the top and}} bottom levels. Its entrance is east-facing, and is double-arched and is decorated with medallions of the shield of the Emperor Charles V. It was once used as a prison, but has since undergone many renovations and has been an entrance point to the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{exterior}} iconography {{includes two}} notable whimsical elements. A downspout {{on the east}} wall features a relief of a bulldog head; a decades-old myth relates that Cram placed it there to recognize Yale University, whose mascot is the bulldog. (Cram was not a Yale alumnus and in fact did not attend college, so {{it is unclear what}} interest he might have had promoting Yale.) A sculptor who worked on the chapel during its construction placed small carvings of his face and Cram's at the bottoms of crockets <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> main entrance; Cram is identifiable by his glasses.|$|E

60|$|While {{on either}} <b>flank</b> <b>the</b> French were now beaten, {{the fight in}} the centre, between the European troops of the English and French Companies, had continued, but had been {{confined}} to a hot musketry and artillery fire.

5|$|The mosques at Gedi {{contained}} {{wells and}} washing facilities, {{which would have}} been used for cleansing prior to worship. However, they were not constructed with minarets used for the call to prayer, which was more characteristic in other regions. Gedi's mosques were typically laid out with anterooms <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> central room, which had a roof supported by wood beams resting on square stone pillars. The isles created by the pillars obstructed the view of the mihrab, which were situated on the north walls in the direction of Mecca.|$|E
5|$|The west façade of {{the castle}} has square towers <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> central bay, with others at the south west and north west, all topped with octagonal, machicolated turrets. The north and south façades are {{relatively}} simple. The east façade has a central projection in the centre rising a storey above the parapet, to form a tower. The tower's south angle is splayed to accommodate the main staircase and only the corbels of its parapet survive. The screen closing off the east entrance has a three-bay cusped arcade {{on the ground floor}} and three ogee arches on the shafts above.|$|E
5|$|The works around Vicksburg are now {{maintained}} by the National Park Service as part of Vicksburg National Military Park. The park, located in Vicksburg, Mississippi, and Delta, Louisiana (<b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> Mississippi River), also commemorates the greater Vicksburg Campaign which {{led up to the}} battle. Reconstructed forts and trenches evoke memories of the 47-day siege that ended in the surrender of the city. Victory here and at Port Hudson, farther south in Louisiana, gave the Union control of the Mississippi River.|$|E

5|$|As the {{perimeter}} shrank and the surviving defenders fell back, they became concentrated {{into a small}} area in the city centre. By now there were about 10,000 German soldiers in the city centre, which was being assaulted from all sides. One of the other main thrusts was along Wilhelmstrasse on which the Air Ministry, built of reinforced concrete, was pounded by large concentrations of Soviet artillery. The remaining German Tiger tanks of the Hermann von Salza battalion took up positions in {{the east of the}} Tiergarten to defend the centre against Kuznetsov's 3rd Shock Army (which although heavily engaged around the Reichstag was also <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> area by advancing through the northern Tiergarten) and the 8th Guards Army advancing through the south of the Tiergarten. These Soviet forces had effectively cut the sausage-shaped area held by the Germans in half and made any escape attempt to the west for German troops in the centre much more difficult.|$|E
5|$|At 0730 the 44th (Lowland) Infantry Brigade and the 46th (Highland) Infantry Brigade of the 15th (Scottish) Infantry Division, {{supported}} by the 31st Tank Brigade moved off their start lines behind a rolling barrage fired from 344 guns. The 46th Brigade initially advanced without armoured support, because in bypassing the mine and booby trap-ridden village of Le Mesnil-Patry, its tanks were forced to negotiate minefields <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> village. The 2nd Battalion, Glasgow Highlanders faced only light resistance, while the 9th Battalion The Cameronians, ran into the grenadiers of the 12th SS Panzer Division, who had allowed the barrage to pass over their positions before opening fire. Reuniting with their tanks at around 1000, by midday the two battalions were fighting for control of their initial objectives; Cheux and Le Haut du Bosq.|$|E
5|$|Many Indian species {{descend from}} taxa {{originating}} in Gondwana, {{from which the}} Indian plate separated more than 105 million years before present. Peninsular India's subsequent movement towards and collision with the Laurasian landmass set off a mass exchange of species. Epochal volcanism and climatic changes 20 million years ago forced a mass extinction. Mammals then entered India from Asia through two zoogeographical passes <b>flanking</b> <b>the</b> rising Himalaya. Thus, while 45.8% of reptiles and 55.8% of amphibians are endemic, only 12.6% of mammals and 4.5% of birds are. Among them are the Nilgiri leaf monkey and Beddome's toad of the Western Ghats. India contains 172 IUCN-designated threatened animal species, or 2.9% of endangered forms. These include the Asiatic lion, the Bengal tiger, the snow leopard and the Indian white-rumped vulture, which, by ingesting the carrion of diclofenac-laced cattle, nearly became extinct.|$|E
