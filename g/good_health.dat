40|$|Abstract Background: To analyse time {{trends in}} self-rated health in older people {{by gender and}} age and examine {{disability}} in the time trends of self-rated health. Methods: The data used come from the Spanish National Health Surveys conducted in 2001, 2003, 2006 and 2011 - 12. Samples of adults aged 16 yr and older were selected. Multivariate logistic regression {{was used to assess}} the association between age, gender, socio-economic status, marital status, disability and self-rated health across period study. Results: Women exhibited lower (higher) prevalence of <b>good</b> self-rated <b>health</b> (disability) compared to men. The multivariate analysis for time trends found that <b>good</b> self-rated <b>health</b> increased from 2001 to 2012. Overall, variables associated with a lower likelihood of <b>good</b> self-rated <b>health</b> were: being married or living with a partner, lower educational level, and disability.

40|$|In this article, {{we provide}} a {{description}} of the <b>good</b> in <b>health</b> promotion. This description comes from an empirical study of health promotion practices in New South Wales, the most populous state in Australia. Through analysis of interviews and observations, we found that practitioners were unified by a vision of the <b>good</b> in <b>health</b> promotion that had substantive and procedural dimensions. Substantively, the <b>good</b> in <b>health</b> promotion was teleological: the good inhered in meliorism, an intention to promote health, which was understood holistically and situated in places and environments, a commitment to primary rather than secondary prevention, and engagement with communities more than individuals. Procedurally, the <b>good</b> in <b>health</b> promotion arose from qualities of practices: that they developed over time in respectful relationships, were flexible and responsive to communities, built capabilities in communities, and were sustainable. We discuss our findings with reference to Martha Nussbaum’s normative list of functional capabilities for a good human life, David Buchanan’s vision for health promotion ethics, and common concerns in health promotion ethics regarding the relationship between paternalism and freedom. Our thick, vague conception of the <b>good</b> in <b>health</b> promotion, founded in the values and practical reason of people engaged daily in health promotion work, makes an important contribution {{to the development of a}} more complete theory of health promotion ethics.
