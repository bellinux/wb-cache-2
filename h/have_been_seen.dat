5|$|Because of the breeds {{that make}} up the Azteca, they are known for their athleticism. They <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in {{competition}} in western riding events such as reining, cutting, team penning and roping, as well as English riding events such as dressage and other events such as polo and bullfighting. They are also used for pleasure riding.|$|E
5|$|Blue whales most {{commonly}} live {{alone or with}} one other individual. It is not known how long traveling pairs stay together. In locations {{where there is a}} high concentration of food, as many as 50 blue whales <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> scattered over a small area. They do not form the large, close-knit groups seen in other baleen species.|$|E
5|$|Cold can be {{a problem}} for small birds that do not migrate.

50|$|The thick-billed raven is omnivorous, {{feeding on}} grubs, beetle larvae from animal dung, carrion, scraps {{of meat and}} human food. It <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> taking {{standing}} wheat. When seeking food from dung, it <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> using a distinct scything movement to scatter the dung and extract the grubs.|$|R
5|$|Other {{relics of}} both classes that have survived are nameplates, which were removed {{towards the end}} of steam on the British Railways Southern Region in the 1960s. As a result, many exist in private collections, and several <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> at auction, selling for several {{thousands}} of pounds.|$|E
5|$|Plant {{species of}} concern at the Darby Creek Mouth Mudflat include Amaranthus cannabinus, Baccharis halimifolia, Bidens bidentoides, Bidens laevis, Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, Heteranthera multiflora, Lycopus rubellus, Pluchea odorata, Sagittaria calycina, Sagittaria subulata, Schoenoplectus fluviatilis, and Zizania aquatica. Some, such as Eleocharis obtusa, Eleocharis parvula, and Heteranthera multiflora, {{have not been}} seen since 1994. However, four other species <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as {{recently}} as 2009.|$|E
5|$|Play-Doh {{packaging}} {{was briefly}} illustrated {{with children in}} the mid-1950s, but replaced by an elf mascot which, in 1960, was superseded by Play-Doh Pete, a smock and beret-wearing cartoonish boy. In 2002, Play-Doh Pete's beret was replaced with a baseball cap. Since 2011, living Play-Doh cans named the Doh-Dohs <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in adverts.|$|E

5|$|Almost every {{sizeable}} body {{of water}} in Scotland has an associated kelpie story, but the most extensively reported is that of Loch Ness. Parallels to the general Germanic neck and the Scandinavian bäckahäst have been observed. More widely, the wihwin of Central America and the Australian bunyip <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as counterparts. The origin of the belief in malevolent water horses has been proposed as originating in human sacrifices once made to appease gods associated with water, but narratives about the kelpie also served a practical purpose in keeping children away from dangerous stretches of water, and warning young women {{to be wary of}} handsome strangers.|$|E
5|$|Another early {{example is}} the 1981 Atari 2600 game Haunted House. Gameplay is typical of future {{survival}} horror titles, as it emphasizes puzzle-solving and evasive action, rather than violence. The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction, such as bats and ghosts, {{each of which has}} unique behaviors. Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management, along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found. Because it has several features that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in later survival horror games, some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre.|$|E
5|$|Arabians are {{involved}} {{in a wide variety of}} activities, including fairs, movies, parades, circuses and other places where horses are showcased. They have been popular in movies, dating back to the silent film era when Rudolph Valentino rode the Kellogg Arabian stallion Jadaan in 1926's Son of the Sheik, and <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> in many other films, including The Black Stallion featuring the stallion Cass Ole, The Young Black Stallion, which used over 40 Arabians during filming, as well as Hidalgo and the 1959 version of Ben-Hur.|$|E

5|$|As well as {{providing}} {{a home for}} some species of birds, Surtsey has also {{been used as a}} stopping-off point for migrating birds, particularly those en-route between Europe and Iceland. Species that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> briefly on the island include whooper swans, various species of geese, and common ravens. Although Surtsey lies {{to the west of the}} main migration routes to Iceland, it has become a more common stopping point as its vegetation has improved. In 2008, the 14th bird species was detected with the discovery of a common raven's nest.|$|E
5|$|Birds <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> as symbols, {{and used}} as such, though {{perceptions}} of bird species vary widely across cultures: some birds have a positive image in some regions, a negative image in others. Owls are associated with bad luck, witchcraft, and death in parts of Africa, but are regarded as wise across much of Europe. Hoopoes were considered sacred in Ancient Egypt and symbols of virtue in Persia, but were thought of as thieves across much of Europe, and harbingers of war in Scandinavia.|$|E
5|$|Drywood {{termites}} {{thrive in}} warm climates, and human activities can {{enable them to}} invade homes since they can be transported through contaminated goods, containers and ships. Colonies of termites <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> thriving in warm buildings located in cold regions. Some termites are considered invasive species. Cryptotermes brevis, the most widely introduced invasive termite species in the world, has been introduced to all the islands in the West Indies and to Australia.|$|E

5|$|During the day, zebra {{sharks are}} {{sluggish}} and usually found {{resting on the}} sea bottom, sometimes using their pectoral fins {{to prop up the}} front part of their bodies and facing into the current with their mouths open to facilitate respiration. Reef channels are favored resting spots, since the tightened space yields faster, more oxygenated water. They become more active at night or when food becomes available. Zebra sharks are strong and agile swimmers, propelling themselves with pronounced anguilliform (eel-like) undulations of the body and tail. In a steady current, they <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> hovering in place with sinuous waves of their tails.|$|E
5|$|Fairywrens exhibit one of {{the highest}} incidences of extra-pair mating, and many broods are brought up a by male who is not the natural father. However, {{courtship}} methods among white-winged fairywrens remain unclear. Blue-plumaged males <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> outside of their territory and in some cases, carrying pink or purple petals, which among other species advertise the male to neighboring females. In contrast, black-plumaged males on Barrow and Dirk Hartog islands often carry blue petals. While petal-carrying outside of clan territories strongly suggests mating with other females is occurring, further genetic analysis is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Fishers are generalist predators. Although {{their primary}} prey is snowshoe hare and porcupine, {{they are also}} known to {{supplement}} their diet with insects, nuts, berries, and mushrooms. Since they are solitary hunters, their choice of prey is limited by their size. Analyses of stomach contents and scat have found evidence of birds, small mammals, and even moose and deer—the latter two indicating {{that they are not}} averse to eating carrion. Fishers <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> to feed on deer carcasses. While the behavior is not common, fishers have been known to kill larger animals, such as wild turkey, bobcat, and lynx.|$|E
50|$|Teleosts {{including}} the brown trout and the scaly osman {{are found in}} mountain lakes in Kashmir at altitudes as high as 3819 m. Teleosts are found at extreme depths in the oceans; the hadal snailfish <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> {{at a depth of}} 7700 m, and a related (unnamed) species <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>seen</b> at 8145 m.|$|R
