500|$|When {{accessing}} the very deep emotions {{called for by}} her character, Mulligan stated, [...] "I really took my cue from the book". She noted that her role did not require her to have much to say, because Kathy {{was more of an}} observer throughout most of the film. She recalled that [...] "every time I was in a scene where I wasn’t quite sure where I was going with it, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the book and read through the lines because she's unreliable, in that much of the time she's not being truly honest with herself or the audience." [...] The young actress said that her friendship with Knightley made their scenes together easier because they would both regard each other's comments helpful and would not feel [...] "insulted or hurt" [...] in discussion.|$|E
500|$|I {{was running}} back and forth, literally, from the editing room with [...] Jonas Akerlund to working with Stuart, who was also mixing the music in the film. We were together, non-stop, all of us. Cutting 350 hours of film down to two hours. There {{are a lot of}} serious aspects to the movie. I needed a release. When <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Stuart's, and we'd go up to his loft, it was like, 'Honey, I want to dance.' I wanted to be happy, silly and buoyant. I wanted to lift myself and others up with this record. So, yes, the new album was a {{reaction}} to all the other stuff I was doing, which was very serious in nature. I hope that doesn't imply that I wanted to make a superficial record, because it's not. I want people to smile when they hear this record. I wanted it to put a smile on my face, too.|$|E
500|$|When Fiasco was 18, {{he began}} {{creating}} {{music as a}} solo artist in his father's basement, even though his parents were not keen on having their son be a rapper. He scoured flea markets and secondhand stores, where {{he was able to}} find an old mixing board and a record player, stacks of vinyl records, and mic stands. [...] At age 19, Fiasco joined a group called Da Pak, which was influenced by other California gangsta rappers such as Spice 1 and Ice Cube. Da Pak signed to Epic Records and released one single before splitting up. Fiasco later described the experience, saying [...] "We had a song out about cocaine, guns, and women, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> a record store and look at it and think, 'What are you doing?' I felt like a hypocrite. I was acting like this rapper who would never be judged, and I had to destroy that guy. Because what Lupe Fiasco says on this microphone is {{going to come back to}} Wasalu Jaco. When the music cuts off, you have to go home and live with what you say." ...|$|E

500|$|The two Dudley {{brothers}} {{were on the}} closest personal terms and Ambrose said of Robert: [...] "there is no man [...] knoweth his doings better than I myself", while Robert's recurrent phrase about Ambrose was: [...] "him I love as myself". Elizabeth, who liked Warwick, loved to joke that he was neither as graceful nor as handsome as his brotherand stouter as well. Lacking a grand London residence of his own, Warwick had his suite of rooms in the palatial Leicester House: [...] "the Lord of Warwick's bedchamber, the Lord of Warwick's closet, the Lord of Warwick's dining parlour". In the administration of their lands the brothers shared their estate managers and lawyers, while their local affinities consisted of the same gentry families. Privately, they were [...] "almost inseparable", passing time together whenever possible. When Robert Dudley had incurred the Queen's wrath while serving in the Netherlands as Governor-General in 1586, Ambrose wrote to him: [...] "if I were you ... <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the furthest part of Christendom rather than ever come into England again. ... Let me have your best advice {{what is best for}} me to do, for that I mean to take such part as you do." ...|$|E

She was a childhood fan of Boney M, composer A. R. Rahman and pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna, also she has cited Björk as an inspiration {{and has been}} influenced by The Slits, Public Enemy, Malcolm McLaren and The Clash. Noting her early inspirations, she said [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> bed, I’d {{listen to the radio}} and dream about dancing and Paula Abdul and Whitney Houston, and that’s how I fell asleep. When my radio was burgled, I started listening to hip hop". She has revealed her ideal karaoke song would be [...] "Germ-Free Adolescents" [...] by X-Ray Spex. M.I.A. describes her music as dance music or club music for the [...] "other", and has been described as an [...] "anti-popstar" [...] for refusing to conform to certain recording industry expectations of solo artists. M.I.A. possesses the vocal range of a mezzo-soprano, [...] M.I.A.'s early compositions relied heavily on the Roland MC-505, while later M.I.A. experimented further with her established sound and drew from a range of genres, creating layered textures of instruments, electronics and sounds outside the traditional studio environment. [...] Nas, Chuck D and Krist Novoselic of Nirvana have praised her work.|$|E
2500|$|Santana {{moved to}} San Francisco and, in October 1966, started the Santana Blues Band. By 1968, the band {{had begun to}} {{incorporate}} different types of influences into their electric blues. [...] "If <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> some cat's room," [...] remembered the guitarist about the band, [...] "he'd be listening to Sly [...] and Jimi Hendrix; another guy to the Stones and the Beatles. Another guy'd be listening to Tito Puente and Mongo Santamaria. Another guy'd be listening to Miles [...] and [...] Coltrane... To me {{it was like being}} at a university." ...|$|E

2500|$|I went to {{the front}} office all the time, and I would say, [...] "John is kicking the dogs and putting them into freezers." [...] Or I would say, [...] "They are {{stepping}} on the animals, crushing them like grapes, and they don't care." [...] In the end, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> work early, before anyone got there, and I would just kill the animals myself. Because I couldn't stand to let them go through that. I must have killed a thousand of them, sometimes dozens every day. Some of those people would take pleasure in making them suffer. Driving home every night, I would cry just thinking about it. And I just felt, to my bones, this cannot be right.|$|E
2500|$|Only Built 4 Cuban Linx... {{features}} {{a wide array}} of Wu-Tang members, as well as Wu-Tang affiliates Cappadonna, and Blue Raspberry. It also {{features a}} guest appearance from rapper Nas, making this the first collaboration with a non-affiliated artist on a Wu-Tang related album. Regarding this event, Nas later recalled [...] "Rae would come out to Queensbridge, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> Staten Island. We'd just ride and hang out all night. We didn't call each other to work. We called each other to hang out. Somehow we wound up in the studio. RZA had a couple of beats. He played them for me. I got on both of them. The other one never came out. I was honored to be asked to be on the album. Raekwon was ahead of his time. I knew Rae was a classic artist and the album {{was going to be a}} music classic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kournikova {{received}} her first tennis racquet as a New Year gift in 1986 at age 5. Describing her early regimen, she said, [...] "I played two {{times a week}} from age six. It was a children's program. And it was just for fun; my parents didn't know I {{was going to play}} professionally, they just wanted me to do something because I had lots of energy. It was only when I started playing well at seven that I went to a professional academy. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> school, and then my parents would take me to the club, and I'd {{spend the rest of the}} day there just having fun with the kids." [...] In 1986, Kournikova became a member of the Spartak Tennis Club, coached by Larissa Preobrazhenskaya. In 1989, at the age of eight, Kournikova began appearing in junior tournaments, and by the following year, was attracting attention from tennis scouts across the world. Kournikova signed a management deal at age ten and went to Bradenton, Florida, to train at Nick Bollettieri's celebrated tennis academy.|$|E

2500|$|Leatherface was {{released}} in 1939. Mahjabeen's looks and talent brought more opportunities, ever since that ugly beginning against her wishes. At the age of four she became the bread earner in the Bux family. In an interview in 1962, Meena Kumari explained that the fact she had been supporting her parents {{from the age of}} four gave her immense satisfaction. Kumari further said [...] "The first day I trotted along to work, I little imagined that I was saying goodbye to the normal pleasantries of childhood. I thought <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> the studio for a few days and then go to the school, learn a few things and play and make merry like other children, but that was not to be". Mahjabeen was admitted into a regular school, but that was not for long, because the demands of work frequently interrupted her curricula. She never went to school in any meaningful sense, and her education was the result of private tuition, and more significantly the result of individual interest; in every sense she was self-educated. Kumari concentrated most on Urdu although she could get by in English and Hindi. Little Mahjabeen used to carry her children's books onto the sets and even while travelling with her parents on outstation shoots. On the sets, little Mahjabeen was nicknamed [...] "Reading Mahjabeen".|$|E
2500|$|To {{begin the}} fourth quarter, the Texas Tech defense forced a Nebraska fourth down and 1 in field goal range. The Cornhuskers {{brought out the}} kicker but faked the field goal and passed for a first down to the 1-yard line. Nebraska's Joe Ganz then scored on a 1-yard quarterback sneak to pull Nebraska within 7 points with 12:10 {{remaining}} in the fourth quarter. After a Red Raider punt, the Cornhuskers once again drove the field and scored on a Ganz 2-yard pass to Dreu Young {{to tie the game}} at 2424. On the very next drive by Texas Tech, the Cornhuskers forced the Red Raiders to a fourth down with 5 yards to go on Texas Tech's own 36-yard line. Mike Leach decided to go for it, and Harrell found Crabtree again for a 47-yard reception keeping the drive alive. Harrell later said of the play, [...] "If he was just a little covered, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> him. I threw it up there and he made the play." [...] A few plays later, Harrell scored on a 1-yard run to give the Red Raiders the lead 3124. Nebraska then drove the field 79 yards in 8 plays and scored on a 17-yard pass from Ganz to Todd Peterson to tie the game at 31 a piece with 29 seconds remaining in the game. Texas Tech failed to score on the next drive and the game went into overtime.|$|E
