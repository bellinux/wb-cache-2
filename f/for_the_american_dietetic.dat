5000|$|Dr. Michael Van Rooyen, {{director}} of the Harvard Humanitarian Initiative, dismissed the observation results as [...] "impossible", observing that the bodies of profoundly malnourished people quickly consume their own body's resources, resulting in liver failure, tachycardia and heart strain. A spokeswoman <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>American</b> <b>Dietetic</b> Association stated that, [...] "The {{bottom line is that}} even fasting for more than a day can be dangerous. You need food to function." [...] Nutrition researcher Peter Clifton also disagreed with study results, accusing the research team of [...] "cheating" [...] by allowing Jani to gargle and bathe, and stating that a human of average weight would die after [...] "15 to 20 days" [...] without water. People who avoid food and water to emulate mystical figures often die. Sanal Edamaruku characterized the experiment as a farce for allowing Jani {{to move out of the}} CCTV cameras' field of view, claiming that video footage showed Jani was allowed to receive devotees and to leave the sealed test room for sunbathing. Edamaruku also said that the gargling and bathing activities were insufficiently monitored. Edamaruku was denied access to the site where the tests were conducted in both 2003 and 2010, and accuses Jani of having [...] "influential protectors" [...] responsible for denying him permission to inspect the project during its operation, despite having been invited to join the test during a live television broadcast. The Indian Rationalist Association observed that individuals making similar claims in the past have been exposed as frauds.|$|E
