For many years, rails could only be made in lengths of up to 60 ft (18m 288mm) in Britain, and the factory welding process made them into 600, 900 or 1200 ft lengths, depending on the factory. The process used was a flash-butt process in which high electrical currents are used to soften the rail end, and the ends are then forced together by rams.

40|$|International audienceThe {{validity}} of {{the description of the}} DFT approximations currently implemented in plane wave DFT codes (LDA, GGA, meta-GGA, hybrid, GGA + empirical dispersion correction) for interactions between rare gases and open-shell atoms which form materials is poorly known. We have performed a first assessment of the accuracy of these functionals for the description of the bonds formed by helium, argon, krypton and xenon with various open-shell atoms. This evaluation has been done on model molecular systems for which precise experimental data are available and reference post-Hartree-Fock calculations (CCSD(T) using large basis sets) are feasible. The results show that when the rare gas atom shares density with the neighbouring atoms, the GGA functionals yield <b>good</b> <b>geometries</b> and qualitatively correct binding energies, even if these are quite significantly overestimated. The use of hybrid functionals enables us to obtain <b>good</b> <b>geometries</b> and satisfactory binding energies. For compounds in which the rare gas atom forms weak dispersive-like bonding, the accuracy yielded by the various functionals is not as good. No functional gives satisfactory binding energies for all the compounds investigated. Several GGA and hybrid functionals yield correct geometries, even if some isomers are not obtained. One GGA functional (PBE) yields qualitatively correct results for the compounds of the three rare gases and several hybrid functionals give satisfactory energies for He compounds. The addition of an empirical dispersive correction improves the results on association compounds, but several isomers are not found...|$|R

Calculation solely of the Fermi contact (FC) term was found to be sufficient to provide good estimates of the coupling constants. In the second part of the work, the conformational equilibria and coupling constants in 2 -bis(2 -chloroethyl) amino-trans-octahydro- 2 H- 1, 3, 2 -benzoxazaphosphinine 2 -oxide and its 3 -methyl derivative were studied.

In this article, we show that the geometry employed in the calculation of NMR chemical shifts in polyoxotungstates is extremely important if we want to be quantitative. Using very large basis sets of QZ 4 P quality and taking into account the conductor-like screening model (COSMO) to account for solvent effects (aqueous and organic solutions), <b>good</b> <b>geometries</b> were found for the polyoxoanions.

With this strategy the mean absolute error between experimental and theoretical values was found to be less than 10  ppm, which is similar to the experimental error.

The systems investigated and used for the tests are two undecagold and one Au 24 +-based nanoclusters stabilized by thiol and phosphine ligands. Time-dependent density-functional theory has been used to compare calculations with experimental data on optical gaps. It has been observed that GGA functionals employing PBE-like correlation (viz., PBE itself, B-PBE, B-P 86, and B-PW 91) coupled with an improved version of the LANL 2 DZ pseudopotential and basis set provide accurate results for both the structure and optical gap of gold nanoclusters, at a reasonable computational cost. <b>Good</b> <b>geometries</b> have been also obtained using some global hybrid (e. g., PBE 0, B 3 -P 86, mPW 1 -PW 91) and range-separated hybrid (e. g., HSE 06) functionals making use of PBE-like correlation, even though they yield optical gaps overestimating the experimental findings up to 0. 5 eV.

40|$|A new {{electromechanical}} {{press for}} fuel pellet manufacturing was built {{last year in}} partnership between CEA-Marcoule and ChampalleAlcen. This press was developed to shape pellets in a hot cell via remote handling. It has been qualified to show its robustness and to optimize the compaction cycle, thus obtaining a better sintered pellet profile and limiting damage. We will show you how 400 annular pellets have been produced with <b>good</b> <b>geometry's</b> parameters, based on press settings management. These results are according to a good phenomenological pressing knowledge with Finite Element Modeling calculation. Therefore, during die pressing, a modification in the punch displacement sequence induces fluctuation in the axial distribution of frictional forces. The green pellet stress and density gradients are based on these frictional forces between powder and tool, and between grains in the powder, influencing {{the shape of the}} pellet after sintering. The pellet shape and diameter tolerances must be minimized to avoid the need for grinding operations. To find the best parameters for the press settings, which enable optimization, FEM calculations were used and different compaction models compared to give the best calculation/physical trial comparisons. These simulations were then used to predict the impact of different parameters when there is a change in the type of powder and the pellet size, or when the behavior of the press changes during the compaction time. In 2016, it is planned to set up the press in a glove box for UO 2 manufacturing qualification based on our simulation methodology, before actual hot cell trials in the future...|$|R

This work is briefly summarized {{in the present}} review. Cys was not described in the previous review: here we describe the Cys characteristic side chain loss of H(2) S, together with its gamma backbone cleavage. These processes are {{compared with those of}} the related Ser. All experimental observations are backed up with theoretical studies at the HF/ 6 - 31 G(d) //AM 1 level of theory, a level of theory which we have shown gives <b>good</b> <b>geometries</b> and acceptable relative energies. The negative ion cleavages of a number of post-translational modifications are described. Negative ion mass spectrometry is the method of choice for identification of disulfides in both peptides and proteins. Intramolecular disulfides are identified by the presence of the fragment anion [(M-H) (-) -H(2) S(2) ], and CID MS 2 of this fragment normally identifies the positions of the two Cys residues and often the full sequence of the peptide. An unsymmetrically substituted intermolecular disulfide can give up to eight characteristic fragment anions, and CID MS 2 of some, or all of these often provides the full sequence of those peptides which form the initial intermolecular disulfide linkage. Negative ion cleavages of disulfides are the most energetically favored of all peptide negative cleavages studied to date. Negative ion mass spectrometry is also valuable for the identification of pyroglutamates, sulfates and phosphates. Finally, some unusual fragmentations are described which involve cyclization/elimination reactions which require the decomposing (M-H) (-) parent anions to adopt the same helical conformation that these peptides have in solution.
