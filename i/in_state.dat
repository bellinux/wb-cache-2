An estimated 200,000 people over three days filed past as she lay <b>in</b> <b>state</b> in Westminster Hall at the Palace of Westminster. Members of the household cavalry and other branches of the armed forces stood guard at the four corners of the catafalque. At one point, her four grandsons Prince Charles, Prince Andrew, Prince Edward and Viscount Linley mounted the guard as a mark of respect—an honour similar to the Vigil of the Princes at the lying <b>in</b> <b>state</b> of King George V.|$|E

5|$|Patterns in Rule 184 {{typically}} quickly stabilize, {{either to}} {{a pattern in}} which the cell states move in lockstep one position leftwards at each step, or to a pattern that moves one position rightwards at each step. Specifically, if the initial density of cells with state 1 is less than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells <b>in</b> <b>state</b> 1, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells <b>in</b> <b>state</b> 0. Patterns of this type move rightwards. If, on the other hand, the initial density is greater than 50%, the pattern stabilizes into clusters of cells <b>in</b> <b>state</b> 0, spaced two units apart, with the clusters separated by blocks of cells <b>in</b> <b>state</b> 1, and patterns of this type move leftwards. If the density is exactly 50%, the initial pattern stabilizes (more slowly) to a pattern that can equivalently be viewed as moving either leftwards or rightwards at each step: an alternating sequence of 0s and 1s.|$|E

50|$|However, among certain demographics, voter ID laws lower electoral confidence. A 2016 study {{concluded}} that Democrats <b>in</b> <b>states</b> with strict ID laws have reduced faith in the electoral system. It said that negative politicization by the Democratic Party may be to blame. On the other hand, Republicans living in strict photo identification states were more confident in their elections, though possibly due to similar politicization by Republican elites. Another 2015 study found that voters living <b>in</b> <b>states</b> with voter ID laws were not more confident in elections than voters who lived <b>in</b> <b>states</b> without such laws. A 2016 study found that people living <b>in</b> <b>states</b> with voter ID laws were no more confident in their elections than people <b>in</b> <b>states</b> without such laws, nor did they perceive lower rates of voter impersonation fraud.|$|R
40|$|Federal {{and state}} {{regulatory}} agencies have traditionally used rate-of-return regulation to set profit and rate levels for utilities. A "price cap" framework, {{in which the}} regulatory agency sets a maximum rate below which the regulated utility has pricing flexibility, is possibly a more efficient alternative to rate-of-return regulation. This article presents an econometric analysis that compares AT&T's prices of intrastate, long-distance telephone service <b>in</b> <b>states</b> that allow AT&T pricing flexibility with those <b>in</b> <b>states</b> that do not. The results of this analysis suggest that AT&T's daytime, evening, nighttime, and weekend rates are significantly lower <b>in</b> <b>states</b> that allow pricing flexibility than <b>in</b> <b>states</b> that use rate-of-return regulation. ...|$|R
