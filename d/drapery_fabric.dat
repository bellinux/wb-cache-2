2500|$|The Green Room was {{refurbished}} {{during the}} summer of 2007 by First Lady Laura Bush with advisement from the Committee for the Preservation of the White House, Bush family interior designer Ken Blasingame, and White House curator William Allman. The refurbishment retained most of the Nixon-era Conger and Jones design. Walls were again hung in silk, but this time in a more vertical and largely scaled moiré pattern and a darker shade. The coral color in the upholstered chairs and in the striped <b>drapery</b> <b>fabric</b> was intensified to a more vibrant shade bordering on vermilion. The drapery recreates Edward Vason Jones' 1971 design but with the more intense vermilion in the silk and the painted cornice. The drapery design was simplified by removing four large tassels but retained the large bobble-fringe of the Nixon-era design. The green Turkish Kilim carpet installed in the Nixon administration was replaced by a new rug woven in the Savonnerie style of France.

50|$|Thompson {{was born}} at West Suburban Hospital in Oak Park, Illinois. Richard's father, Abijah Snyder Thompson, was an {{illustrator}} and commercial art director for Montgomery Ward in Chicago. At a young age Thompson was introduced to many of his father’s colleagues, sparking an early interest in the arts. He started to draw pencil sketches at age eight after watching his father draw {{at home in the}} evening. Richard's father also shared with his son his love for fishing and nature. When it was seasonable, they would travel from Chicago to Lake Geneva, Wisconsin, on weekend fishing trips. The nature scenes he observed on these excursions became subjects for his sketches. At age ten, Richard awoke a couple of hours before his parents on Christmas morning to find a gift with his name under the Christmas tree. Upon opening, he found it to be his own paint box together with canvas board, brushes, and paints. He set up a still life with an apple, orange, and a piece of <b>drapery</b> <b>fabric</b> from his mother’s sewing room. He painted for about two hours, and when his parents awoke they saw Richard’s first finished painting. They were so proud of his achievement that it served to intensify his desire to paint.|$|E

50|$|Fabric {{flammability}} is {{an important}} textile issue, especially for stage drapery {{that will be used}} in a public space such as a school, theatre or special event venue. In the United States, Federal regulations require that <b>drapery</b> <b>fabrics</b> used in such spaces be certified as flame or fire-retardant. For <b>draperies</b> and other <b>fabrics</b> used in public places, this is known as the NFPA 701 Test, which follows standards developed by the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA).

40|$|The {{concern of}} {{increasing}} energy consumption with depleting energy resources is ever growing. Though {{the solution to}} this problem lies in part in renewable energies, it is becoming increasingly clear that sustainable building design also plays a critical role. Controlling solar gain, for example, can greatly reduce the cooling energy consumption and lowering the peak cooling load. Having the ability to model these effects can have a substantial impact on the sizing of equipment and further reduce operational costs of a building. As a result, renewed interest has been invested by researchers and industry to promote the development and use of building simulation tools to aid in the design process. Efforts at the University of Waterloo’s Advanced Glazing Systems Laboratory have resulted in a set of shading device models, with emphasis on generality and computational efficiency, tailored for use in building simulation. These models have been validated with measurements at the component level and with measurements performed at the National Solar Test Facility (NSTF) on a full scale window system, giving confidence to model validity. Continued research has resulted in the integration of these shading device models into ESP-r via the Complex Fenestration Construction (CFC) module, capable of modelling multi-layer glazing and shading layer systems and greatly improving the value of ESP-r as a design tool. The objective of the current research was to implement shading device models for roller blinds, pleated drapes and insect screens to the CFC module. These would be in addition to the venetian blind model which had previously been established. A Monte-Carlo ray tracing analysis of pleated drape geometry and incident angle dependent fabric characteristics gave further confidence to the view factor or net reduction method used by the implemented models. On model implementation, a preliminary comparison was performed between a high-slat angle venetian blind, a roller drape and <b>drapery</b> <b>fabric,</b> all given the same material properties, with similar results. Further comparison was then performed using EnergyPlus shading device models to establish further confidence in the functionality of the models. Though there was some discrepancy between the results, primarily due to convective models, good agreement was found, and the effect of the shading device models on building performance was demonstrated. The successful implementation of roller blind, pleated drape and insect screen shading models to the CFC module in ESP-r has been demonstrated in the current research. It {{should also be noted that}} the convective models for indoor shading attachments is a worthwhile topic for further research, at which point it would then be beneficial to conduct further empirical validation on the ESP-r simulation...|$|E

40|$|Solar gain through {{fenestration}} has {{a significant}} impact on building peak load and annual energy consumption. Shading devices, attached to fenestration, offer a cost effective strategy in controlling solar gain. The performance of a particular shading device is dependent on solar optical and longwave radiative properties of the device. The current study considers longwave properties of three flat shading materials; <b>drapery</b> <b>fabrics,</b> insect screens and roller blinds. Each of these materials consists of a structure (i. e., yarn, wire, sheet) that is opaque with respect to longwave (infrared) radiation and each material is likely to have some openness. Material emittance and longwave transmittance measurements were taken with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results show emittance and longwave transmittance to be simple functions of openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. This is especially useful because openness can be determined from solar transmittance measurements while emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure was found to be constant for each category of shading material.

40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 56 - 59) Textile {{products can}} be printed by several different methods. The method considered {{in this study}} is silk screen printing, an important resist process in present use. Therefore, this research was conducted to investigate the hypotheses that a selected sample of screen printed fabrics will exhibit high color fastness ratings as measured by standard test procedures; that consumers are interested in the colorfastness properties of textile products; and that consumers use their knowledge of screen printed textiles when making decisions concerning the purchase of' selected textile products. A questionnaire was developed to determine consumer interest in the colorfastness properties of printed textiles, consumer knowledge of screen printing, consumer interest in purchasing textile products having screen printed designs, and the influence of identifiable screen prints in the consumer???s decision to purchase textile products. This questionnaire was given to 100 women living in the San Fernando Valley in the Los Angeles area. Chi squares were computed {{with the use of a}} General Electric 445 computer. Twenty screen printed fabrics of various fiber content were selected and tested for color fastness to laundering, carbon-arc light, perspiration, and crocking. The fabric samples were evaluated using AATCC scales. The selected <b>fabrics</b> included swimwear, <b>drapery,</b> and apparel. Two of the four swimwear fabrics had good colorfastness qualities. The other two fabrics would not be considered colorfast. The four <b>drapery</b> <b>fabrics</b> generally were colorfast in each of the four tests.

40|$|This {{paper will}} examine {{changes in the}} home market retail and {{distribution}} structure for British dress fabric. Increasing concentration of retail firms, with a transition to sales of ready-to-wear clothing rather than <b>drapery</b> <b>fabrics</b> for home dressmaking, was combined with challenges to the existing wholesale distribution structure by both manufacturers and retailers. This encouraged {{the establishment of a}} volatile fashion-driven consumer market in the interwar period. The retail structure in the home market changed significantly during the period, with the expansion of chain stores, establishment of manufacturers’ brands (supported by fixed retail prices) and broadening of access to consumer goods through the increasing availability of credit. Retailers and wholesalers changed their ordering practices in response to uncertainty of economic conditions and changes in demand, with smaller stocks held and a wider range of lines offered. A concentration of drapery sales in department stores, due to the costs of carrying a wide variety of lines, was intensified by the amalgamation of department stores. Further concentration away from the small independent drapery stores and wholesalers occurred with the establishment of large urban Co-operative retail stores and expansion of multiples that focused on sales of ready-to-wear clothing. A more dynamic competitive environment developed, with forwards integration from producers and backwards integration from retailers. The increase of branded lines by manufacturers and printers demonstrates their emergence in a more active entrepreneurial role rather the usual, passive commission-processing system. Some retail chains initiated controversial direct trading with manufacturers while department stores took on a merchanting role and commissioned textile prints or even produced small experimental ranges themselves. A fundamental shift in the production/ consumption process was the widening of the relevance of fashionability to all classes of textiles and across the social scale, with the consequent displacement of the ideal of durability. These changes led to a disappearance of the trickle-down time lag from couture to mass fashion whilst increasing market volatility. The establishment of the new model of consumption was viewed with concern by print companies due to the unpredictability of demand and higher production and promotion costs. However, the establishment of a fashionability model for all price levels of dress fabric increased personal choice and raised the significance of design in mass-market printed dress fabrics. These changes in the textiles retail and distribution structure indicate the transition to a recognisably modern mass consumer society...|$|R

The different shading devices examined were roller blinds, insect screens, pleated drapes and venetian blinds. The energy performance of windows with shading devices was modeled using a two step procedure. Solar radiation was considered in the first step by developing a multi-layer solar optical model for glazing/shading systems. This newly developed model is an extension of an existing model for systems of specular glazing layers and includes the effect of layers that create scattered, specifically diffuse, radiation in reflection and/or transmission. Spatially-averaged (effective) optical properties were used to characterise shading layers, including their beam-diffuse split. The multi-layer solar optical model estimates the system solar transmission and absorbed solar components. The absorbed solar components appear as energy source terms in the second step – the heat transfer analysis. The heat transfer analysis involves the formulation of energy balance equations and requires both effective longwave properties and convective heat transfer coefficients as input. The simultaneous solution of the energy balance equations yields the temperature as well as the convective and radiative fluxes. The effective solar optical properties of flat materials like <b>drapery</b> <b>fabrics,</b> roller blinds and insect screens were obtained by developing a new measurement technique. Special sample holders were designed and fabricated to facilitate measurements using an integrating sphere installed in a commercially available spectrophotometer. Semi-empirical models were then developed to quantify the variation of solar optical properties with respect to incidence angle. In turn, effective layer properties of venetian blinds and pleated drapes were modeled using a more fundamental net radiation scheme. The effective longwave properties of flat materials were obtained by taking measurements with an infrared reflectometer using two backing surfaces. The results enabled simple models to be developed relating emittance and longwave transmittance to openness, emittance and longwave transmittance of the structure. In turn, effective longwave properties of venetian blinds and pleated drapes were modeled using a net radiation scheme. Convective heat transfer correlations were readily available. Finally, the newly developed models were validated by measuring the solar gain through various shading devices attached to a double glazed window using the National Solar Test Facility (NSTF) solar simulator and solar calorimeter. Solar gain results were also obtained from simulation software that incorporated the models. There was good agreement between the measured and the simulated results thus strengthening confidence in the newly developed models...|$|R
