Our {{main goal}} is to find features for audio fingerprinting that are invariant to time and <b>frequency</b> <b>distortions,</b> both unintentional and intentional. Twodimensional features, called “joint acoustic and modulation frequency,” are proposed. The paper describes these features and corresponding cross entropy classification. Experimental results show that standard spectral features are inadequate when <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> occurs, as in low bit rate coding or equalization. In contrast, our proposed normalized modulation frequency features can provide accurate fingerprints, even when time and <b>frequency</b> <b>distortions</b> are imposed on music passages. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—We model a {{degraded}} {{image as}} an original image {{that has been}} subject to linear <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and additive noise injection. Since the psychovisual effects of <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> and noise injection are independent, we decouple these two sources of degradation and measure their effect on the human visual system. We develop a distortion measure (DM) {{of the effect of}} <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion,</b> and a noise quality measure (NQM) of the effect of additive noise. The NQM, which is based on Peli’s contrast pyramid, takes into account the following: 1) variation in contrast sensitivity with distance, image dimensions, and spatial frequency; 2) variation in the local luminance mean; 3) contrast interaction between spatial frequencies; 4) contrast masking effects. For additive noise, we demonstrate that the nonlinear NQM is a better measure of visual quality than peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR) and linear quality measures. We compute the DM in three steps. First, we find the <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> in the degraded image. Second, we compute the deviation of this <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> from an allpass response of unity gain (no distortion). Finally, we weight the deviation by a model of the frequency response of the human visual system and integrate over the visible frequencies. We demonstrate how to decouple distortion and additive noise degradation in a practical image restoration system. Index Terms—Computational vision, human visual system modeling, image quality.

However, the method given there is implicit. We show here the interesting result that if the Noumerov-type methods of [2] are made explicit {{with the help of}} the classical second order method, then there exists a selection of the free parameter for which the resulting method has a considerably small <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> of size (140320) H 6 and also a (slightly) larger interval of periodicity of size 2. 75 than the phase-lag of size (112096) H 6 and interval of periodicity of size 2. 71 for the implicit method [2].

40|$|Low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> {{components}} of the output voltage of a cycloconverter are {{largely responsible for the}} restriction on its practical range: of frequencies, and the object of this thesis is to show that these components can be attenuated by the application of sampling techniques to the control system. After a general description of the operation and control of the cycloconverter, the distortion of the output waveform due to low frequency components is discussed. Under these circumstances, the fundamental repetition frequency of the waveform is less than the wanted output frequency, and two methods of determining it for given input and output frequencies are developed. The characteristics and properties of the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components, and the requirements for attenuating them are analysed. The particular effects on the magnitudes of these components due to operation of the cycloconverter in the inhibited mode, rather than the circulating-current mode, are examined and the requirements for attenuating them are identified. It is shown that the communications engineering processes of pulse width modulation and of natural sampling can be identified in the control of the cycloconverter. Regular sampling is more widely used in communications engineering, and its effect on the low <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> components in the cycloconverter output is compared with natural sampling. A modified control method for the inhibited cycloconverter is then developed to attenuate these components. Digital computer programs were written to test the effect of introducing modifications to the control of the cycloconverter, and the more significant results are given in graphical and tabulated form. An experimental cycloconverter, with an inhibition control circuit designed for this project, was constructed to check the validity of the computer programs.

Understanding how and why probability is distorted is a key issue in understanding the peculiar character of experience-based decision.

Very similar patterns of distortion of probability/frequency information have been found in visual frequency estimation, frequency estimation based on memory, signal detection theory, and in the use of probability information in decision-making under risk and uncertainty. We show that distortion of probability in all cases is well captured as linear transformations of the log odds of frequency and/or probability, a model with a slope parameter and an intercept parameter. We then consider how task and experience influence these two parameters and the resulting distortion of probability. We review how the probability distortions change in systematic ways with task and report three experiments on <b>frequency</b> <b>distortion</b> where the distortions change systematically in the same task.
