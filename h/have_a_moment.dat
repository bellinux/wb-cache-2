5|$|On September 6, Art Modell died in Baltimore {{at the age}} of 87. Although the Browns {{planned to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence on their home opener for their former owner, his family asked the team not to, well aware of the less-than-friendly {{reaction}} it was likely to get. Weeden started the Browns' first game of the season. The 28-year-old rookie threw four interceptions in a 17–16 loss to Philadelphia in which the Browns' only touchdown was scored by the defense.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the initial}} {{characterizations}} of tsunami earthquakes came from seismologist Hiroo Kanamori in the early 1970s, and additional clarity materialized following the 1992 Nicaragua earthquake and tsunami, which was evaluated to have a surface wave magnitude of 7.0 when analyzing short period seismic signals. When longer period signals of around 250 seconds were investigated, the shock was reevaluated to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> magnitude of 7.6, with a hypothesis that the slow nature of the slip of the event may have concealed its substantial extent. Sediment was thought to have contributed to a slower rupture, due to a lubrication effect at the plate interface, with the result being an earthquake signature that had abundant long period seismic signals, which could {{be an important factor}} in the tsunami-generation process.|$|E

500|$|Lithgow called Rita's death a [...] "fantastic choice", {{which he}} said shed a {{completely}} different light on the final scene between Dexter and Arthur, {{which appears to be}} somewhat sympathetic before the audience learned what Arthur had done. Lithgow said he knew that Arthur would be killed {{from the very beginning of}} the season. He said he particularly enjoyed working with Michael C. Hall in [...] "The Getaway", and particularly cited the opening scene in the police station, where he said Hall was [...] "so great at working out the rhythms and finding the real meaning" [...] of the moment where Dexter realizes Arthur has the advantage over him. Lithgow also said he enjoyed their final scene together, including the moment where he realized his daughter had committed suicide: [...] "It's very unusual for a character that despicable to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> like that, a moment of such pain." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} by critics who gave a polarised {{view on the}} writing and handling of Shepherd's death. Ashley Bissette Sumerel of TV Fanatic gave the episode the highest praise in a 5 out of 5 star review highlighting the [...] "interesting possibilities" [...] that the death would offer for the show. However, she stated, [...] "I'm beyond heartbroken. [...] We've seen tragic deaths and lost beloved characters, but never quite like this. I don't think I'll ever get over it." [...] She also acknowledged the show's emotional connect with its audience and it's courage to attempt the [...] "inconceivable". Ariana Bacle of Entertainment Weekly {{took the opportunity to}} reminisce {{the early years of the}} show saying that it's the compelling characters that have made committing to Grey's [...] "irresistible". She added that despite some [...] "weak moments" [...] that the series suffers from, characters like [...] "Meredith or Derek or Webber will <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> that reminds me why I keep watching, why I never stopped— so watching one of those characters die hurts. It really, really hurts." [...] In a mixed review for the episode, a Spoiler TV writer criticized the plot calling it a [...] "self-indulgent episode", contrasted it with [...] "well crafted departure of Mark Sloan, or by Lexie Grey". Also criticizing the absence of the series' major cast from the episode the review said, [...] "The presence of so many inconsequential and uninteresting characters was continually in danger of swamping the dreaminess of Derek." [...] However, appreciative of Pompeo's character, the reviewer remarked, [...] "the writing of Meredith was completely on point. She was clinical, as we would expect her to be." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{trying to}} <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> of silence for Li'l Sebastian {{in the parks}} {{department}} office, the staff is interrupted when a custodian playing the Shania Twain song [...] "Man! I Feel Like a Woman!" [...] on his radio. This scene was actually based on something {{that happened in the}} writer's room. Ron discovers Leslie and Ben's affair after they accidentally pocket dial him while sexually role-playing with political figures. At one point, Leslie tells Ben she is going to kiss him both like former First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt, and Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Ruth Bader Ginsburg. At another, Ben impersonates former President Ronald Reagan, which prompts Leslie, pretending to be United Kingdom Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, to say, [...] "Oh, President Reagan, my blazer popped open." [...] In a different scene, Andy seeks to write a song for Li'l Sebastian that is 5,000 times better than Elton John's [...] "Candle in the Wind", which inspires him to write the original song [...] "5,000 Candles in the Wind". Other songs played during Li'l Sebastian's memorial service include [...] "Wild Horses" [...] by The Rolling Stones and [...] "A Horse with No Name" [...] by America. In an attempt to explain to someone that she and Ben were hugging, Leslie explains she recently won a McArthur Genius Grant and that Ben was simply congratulating her. In addition, during Tom and Jean-Ralphio's eulogy presentation for Lil' Sebastian, a still of the Trifid Nebula in Sagittarius is seen. The image is more popularly recognized as the cover art for progressive rock band King Crimson's 1971 album Islands.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{revealed}} that Hank Pym had a daughter named Nadia through Maria Trovaya who was abducted and supposedly killed by foreign agents. This caused Nadia to be raised in the Red Room until the day she obtained a Pym Particle sample that enabled her to escape.

2500|$|A line L in 3-dimensional Euclidean {{space is}} {{determined}} by two distinct points that it contains, or by two distinct planes that contain it. Consider the first case, with points x= (x1,x2,x3) and y= (y1,y2,y3). The vector displacement from x to y is nonzero because the points are distinct, and represents {{the direction of the}} line. That is, every displacement between points on L is a scalar multiple of d= y−x. If a physical particle of unit mass were to move from x to y, it would <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>moment</b> about the origin. The geometric equivalent is a vector whose direction is perpendicular to the plane containing L and the origin, and whose length equals twice the area of the triangle formed by the displacement and the origin. Treating the points as displacements from the origin, the moment is m= x×y, where [...] "×" [...] denotes the vector cross product. For a fixed line, L, the area of the triangle is proportional to the length of the segment between x and y, considered as the base of the triangle; it is not changed by sliding the base along the line, parallel to itself. By definition the moment vector is perpendicular to every displacement along the line, so d•m= 0, where [...] "•" [...] denotes the vector dot product.|$|E
