40|$|Concrete {{infrastructure}} can be {{deficient in}} structural strength relative to current needs. A competitive {{option for the}} strengthening of concrete slab-on-beam structures that are deficient in shear capacity is U-wrapping of the <b>downstand</b> <b>beam</b> portion of the shear span with bonded FRP fabric. Shear failure is often precipitated by {{the formation of a}} dominant diagonal crack through the section. It is therefore important to understand the load sharing behaviour and the transfer of forces between concrete, steel and FRP at this critical interface. This paper examines the relationship between previous work on shear transfer and some of the implications for the behaviour of reinforced concrete beams strengthened with externally bonded FRP fabrics...|$|E
40|$|The cost of {{assessing}} and strengthening deficient bridge structures {{has been estimated}} as being in excess of £ 4 billion for the UK and $ 140 billion for the US. One option for strengthening concrete slab-on-beam structures that are deficient in shear capacity is the U-wrapping of the <b>downstand</b> <b>beam</b> portion of the shear span with bonded FRP fabric. This technique is currently in use worldwide. To investigate {{the effectiveness of this}} technique and the accuracy of the existing design guidance, a series of 3 -point bending tests were carried out on 360 mm and 540 mm deep reinforced concrete T-beams strengthened with externally bonded CFRP fabric. This investigation found that in some cases the CFRP ‘strengthening’ enhanced the shear capacity of the beams relative to nominally identical control specimens, while in other cases, an apparent reduction in shear capacity was found. This paper presents some of these counterintuitive results and discusses their implications for our understanding of strengthened beam behaviour...|$|E

40|$|AbstractOn {{the basis}} of a series of the {{full-scale}} fire tests carried out on the composite frame at Cardington, a design method is now well established to calculate the performance of composite flooring systems subject to fire. The method models in a simplified fashion the influence of tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs which are formed as an array of composite beams using solid-web steel <b>downstand</b> <b>beams</b> which are largely unprotected. The development of membrane action depends on the conditions of vertical support maintained around the boundaries of the fire-affected slab panels by protected beams. Cellular beams can achieve the same strength as unperforated I-beams of the same depth, with significantly reduced steel mass, and the ability to accommodate service ducts within the beam depth, and therefore the use of composite cellular beams as floor members is becoming increasingly popular in construction. Due to the general lack of research on perforated sections, the guidance about their design for fire conditions remains rather primitive. Moreover, tensile membrane action in composite floor slabs with cellular steel <b>downstand</b> <b>beams</b> could exhibit very different behaviour in fire from that when solid-web sections are used. A parametric study has been carried out as an initial investigation into the fire performance of cellular beams within composite slab systems, including the effects of tensile membrane action in enhancing the load-carrying capacity. The effects of changes to the edge support conditions are also investigated. The results show the protected perimeter beams maintained their load-carrying capacity and were subject only to small vertical displacements, although web-post buckling was observed to occur on the protected secondary beam near to a support. This suggests that maintenance of vertical support is not sufficient for a slab panel with cellular beams. Web-post buckling or the Vierendeel mechanism may govern the mode of structural failure, indicating that the sizes of openings and their positioning necessitate careful design...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{addresses the}} design of reinforced concrete flat slabs for punching shear. Flat slabs are two way spanning slabs without <b>downstand</b> <b>beams</b> that are directly supported by columns. The thickness of flat slabs is typically governed by considerations of either deflection control or punching shear {{for which there is}} still no widely accepted theoretical treatment. The research seeks to develop {{a better understanding of the}} effects of in-plane restraint and flexural continuity on the punching resistance of flat slabs. The overriding aim is to determine whether flexural continuity is sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of existing flat slabs which appear punching shear deficient when assessed against test data from isolated punching shear specimens. The influence of slab continuity on punching resistance is assessed through analysis of test data, nonlinear finite element analysis (NLFEA) and fib MC 2010 Level of Approximation (LoA) IV which is based on the Critical Shear Crack Theory (CSCT) of Muttoni. The CSCT relates shear resistance to the width of the so-called ‘critical shear crack’ which depends on slab rotation. MC 2010 has four LoA of which I to III are intended for design. Punching resistance is normally determined from tests on isolated slab-column specimens which are intended to simulate behaviour within the elastic line of contraflexure for radial moments, although the benefits of continuity on punching shear strength is well known. MC 2010 LoA IV, which uses nonlinear finite element analysis to determine the slab rotation, is used to investigate and develop a better understanding of the influence of continuity on the punching shear resistance of flat slabs at edge and internal columns. The FE model is calibrated against relevant test data from both isolated and continuous specimens. Parametric studies are presented which show the superseded UK design code BS 8110 to require significantly less punching shear reinforcement than EC 2 (2004) and MC 2010 LoA II which give reasonable strength predictions for isolated internal column punching specimens. Despite this, slabs designed to BS 8110 have performed satisfactorily for many years. MC 2010 LoA IV is used to show that punching resistance at internal columns can be increased significantly by restraint from the surrounding slab. The increase in punching resistance due to continuity is shown to be sufficient to explain the satisfactory performance of flat slabs designed to BS 8110 at internal columns. However, the strength increase is variable and, in the case of uniformly loaded slabs, already largely included in BS 8110 and EC 2. The research also considers the influence of slab continuity on punching resistance at edge columns. Parametric studies are developed to examine the influence of shear force eccentricity, flexural reinforcement distribution between support and span, and modelling assumptions on the punching resistance of flat slabs at edge columns. Relating the punching resistance at edge columns to the elastic unbalanced moment as done in MC 2010 LoA II and III is shown to be overly conservative for continuous slabs. The ACI 318 and EC 2 practice of making the design punching resistance independent of the unbalanced moment is reviewed and shown to be reasonable particularly for continuous slabs. MC 2010 LoA IV is shown to be a powerful tool for assessment, however the predictions for the method are very sensitive to the modelling assumptions and boundary conditions. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{provides}} the systematic derivation {{of a new}} analytical approach to tensile membrane action of lightly-reinforced thin concrete slabs at large deflections. The basic motivation for the work comes from the recent use of tensile membrane action as an enhancement, in the fire condition, of {{the capacity of the}} thin concrete slabs which are normally made composite with <b>downstand</b> steel <b>beams,</b> at temperatures which have substantially degraded the contribution of these steel beams. The method accepts as a premise that such slabs form a pattern of localized yield lines as an initial small-deflection failure mechanism, and that these yield lines retain their positions as subsequent deflection occurs. As the slab deflects, maintaining the correct kinematics of the articulation and displacement of the system of slab facets, interacting across the yield lines, is extremely important to the horizontal equilibrium of the slab. In this process it becomes necessary to re-think the basic assumption of traditional yield-line theory that any local cross-section of unit width along a yield line equilibrates the force of its concrete compression block with the yielded steel’s tension force, producing constant plastic moment capacities for the mesh in either direction along any yield line. In the approach set out in this paper only overall equilibrium of the system of facets needs to be maintained. As in normal rigid-plastic analysis, concrete acts only when compressed, and then at its compressive strength, and steel acts at its tensile yield strength whilst it remains intact. However, steel in either direction can fracture when the local crack-width causes its local strain to exceed its fracture ductility. When the rebar crossing the diagonal yield lines begins to fracture this generally indicates that the slab’s capacity is about to reduce with further deflection. The paper does not attempt to address how a rebar’s free length across a discrete crack is generated, or the limiting crack widths implied, but this is shown in a range of examples to be a major issue if tensile membrane action is to be used in practice to enhance the capacity of slabs, for example in hazard loading situations. It is important that principles be established in future to quantify this aspect of rebar ductility...|$|R
40|$|An {{alternative}} {{simplified method}} of tensile membrane action (TMA) of thin-flat concrete slabs {{at ambient temperature}} was extended to consider composite slabs in fire. The existing simplified method (Bailey-BRE) of estimating the influence of tensile membrane action on the slab strength in fire has some shortcomings in its assumptions and results. The alternative simplified method showed reasonable results, avoiding inherent flaws in the existing method that cause large differences in the results when a marginal change in reinforcement ratio is made. This thesis takes into consideration {{the presence of a}} secondary <b>downstand</b> steel <b>beam</b> which was left unprotected against elevated temperatures. The main objectives of this study were: 1. to examine the mechanics of tensile membrane action of composite slabs in the presence of an unprotected secondary beam; 2. to examine the similarity of the structural behaviour of composite slabs with the results of the alternative method of flat slabs in terms of the benefits of large deflections; 3. to compare the extended method in this study against the existing Bailey-BRE simplified method. The mechanics behind this study was divided into two main parts: 1. small-deflection analysis; 2. large-deflection analysis. The small-deflection analysis is based on the yield-line theory, where the slab was heated from the bottom side, affecting the unprotected secondary steel beam, until the yield-lines formed in {{what is known as the}} “optimum yield-line pattern”. The second part of the study took this yield-line pattern configuration. With further deflection, tensile membrane action started to mobilize, and the slab gained further capacity. The method accounts for the internal work dissipation by the reinforcement and the steel beam as they extend, which contributes to the total internal work of the slab. The small-deflection analysis was coded in Visual Basic in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, increasing the temperature to obtain the optimum yield-line pattern. The large-deflection analysis was coded in Matlab in order to conduct a deflection-controlled loop, increasing the temperature until the failure of the slab, giving the temperature enhancement for every deflection level through the analysis. The study allows the stress pattern around the yield-lines to be monitored. It also monitors the formation of the cracks on the slab, reinforcement fracture in different phases as the temperature increases and the slab deflects, until the structural failure. Comparisons against the Bailey-BRE method confirmed that the latter is conservative when small size reinforcement is used, as previous studies showed...|$|R
