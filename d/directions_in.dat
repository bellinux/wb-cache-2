50|$|The Australian Film Institute Award for Best <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> Television {{is awarded}} {{annually}} by the Australian Film Institute for excellence <b>in</b> <b>direction</b> of television drama. Prior to 1990, two awards existed and were called Best <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> a Mini Series and Best <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> a Telefeature. The awards were merged in 1990 to become Best <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> a Telefeature or Mini Series which in 1991 was renamed Best Achievement <b>in</b> <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> a Television Drama. In 2004, this award became Best <b>Direction</b> <b>in</b> Television.|$|R

5|$|LIDAR {{comprises}} firing lasers at relevant {{portions of}} the atmosphere where light is backscattered.

5|$|Specifically, the HPP lattice gas model {{consists}} of particles moving at unit velocity {{in the four}} axis-parallel directions. When two particles meet on the same line in opposite directions, they collide and are sent outwards from the collision point on the perpendicular line. This system obeys the conservation laws of physical gases, and produces simulations whose appearance resembles the behavior of physical gases. However, it was found to obey unrealistic additional conservation laws. For instance, the total momentum within any single line is conserved. As well, the differences between axis-parallel and non-axis-parallel <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> this model (its anisotropy) is undesirably high. The FHP lattice gas model improves the HPP model by having particles moving in six different directions, at 60 degree angles to each other, instead of only four <b>directions.</b> <b>In</b> any head-on collision, the two outgoing particles are deflected at 60 degree angles from the two incoming particles. Three-way collisions are also possible in the FHP model and are handled {{in a way that}} both preserves total momentum and avoids the unphysical added conservation laws of the HPP model.|$|E

5|$|A mile (1.6km) {{north of}} NY417, NY16 reaches a bridge over Olean Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Allegheny. On the other side, it becomes a four-lane road with a divider as it approaches NY17, currently concurrent with I-86 pending the entire expressway's upgrade to Interstate Highway standards. A trumpet interchange provides access to I-86 and NY17 in both <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> the vicinity of Baldwin Heights. But NY16 runs parallel to the freeway and remains a four-lane route, although no longer divided, following the Olean valley. At Hinsdale it finally does cross I-86/NY17. Shortly afterwards, in the hamlet of Maplehurst, NY446, the former route of NY408, comes in from the east and terminates.|$|E

5|$|I-35E was {{completed}} {{north of downtown}} Saint Paul in 1970. The first section to open ran north from Maryland Avenue in Saint Paul to I-694 in Little Canada; this {{was completed}} in the early 1960s, concurrently with I-694 west to old MN49 (Rice Street). Later that decade, I-35E was extended south to downtown Saint Paul, opening first to Pennsylvania Avenue and then to I-94, including the I-35E / I-94 concurrency (and I-94 in both <b>directions).</b> <b>In</b> 1970, I-35E was extended north along the I-35E / I-694 concurrency in Little Canada– Vadnais Heights and also extended northbound to its northern terminus at Columbus near Forest Lake; the adjacent sections of I-35, I-35W, and I-694 opened {{at about the same}} time.|$|E
5|$|In 2015, some rush-hour peak-direction F trains started {{skipping}} local stops between Jay Street and Fourth Avenue, and the MTA {{is planning}} to use expanded rush-hour express service (from Jay Street to Church Avenue) in both <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> the summers of 2016 and 2017. In May 2016, the MTA announced that half of all rush-hour F trains may start running express in both <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> fall 2017; however, because of rolling stock and track capacity limitations, the train frequency {{on the rest of}} the F route would remain the same. However, with the introduction of the R179s, one more train per hour could be run on the F. The operation of half of the F trains as express would result in operational improvements, with faster service, as southbound F trains would no longer be delayed by terminating G trains discharging at Church Avenue. Overall, the F express will result in an overall reduction of 27,000 minutes during the AM rush hour and 13,000 minutes during the PM rush hour. The change in service will decrease service at local stations, reducing in longer wait times, but it will help riders in South Brooklyn with the longest commutes. F express trains would be slightly more crowded than current F trains, but the F locals would be less crowded. PM rush hour express service would lead to much larger exit surges from less frequent F local trains at Bergen Street and Carroll Street, leading to significant congestion at one staircase at Bergen Street, and moderate congestion at one staircase at Carroll St. Relieving the congestion, would entail widening the staircases and installing ADA-required elevators that would cost approximately $10 million per station.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} {{characters}} of the series, Perry was structured in a simple style to allow young viewers to easily draw him. In keeping with the show's general design scheme, Perry is constructed of geometric shapes in a style reminiscent of deceased Looney Tunes animator Tex Avery. Povenmire uses different design styles for drawing Perry depending on how he is portrayed. When Perry is portrayed as a domesticated and mindless pet, Povenmire begins with a square shaped like a loaf of bread. He then draws his front legs and feet before drawing his bill, which is set at a certain angle. Povenmire then draws his eyeballs, which are never focused and look in opposing <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> a daze. He concludes the figure by adding his hind legs, tail, hair, and finally color.|$|E

5|$|M-33 was {{designated}} by 1919 along {{a section of}} the current highway between Mio and Atlanta. The highway also included roadway segments south of Mio that are now parts of other trunklines. The portion south of Mio was rerouted in the mid-1920s, transferring sections to M-72 in the process. The state started extending M-33 in both <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> 1930s. The current highway segment between Onaway and Cheboygan was the former route of US Highway 23 (US23) until 1940 when the latter highway was realigned onto an alignment that runs along Lake Huron. Several minor changes have been made to M-33's routing since the 1950s to straighten out curves or finish paving the highway.|$|E
5|$|On June 10, a {{powerful}} squall line of thunderstorms with embedded supercells developed across New York and moved northeast through parts of northern New England and Quebec.

Barns were reported damaged and other structures sustained roof and siding damage; {{particularly in the}} Saint-Blaise-sur-Richelieu area where one home was pushed from its foundation. In Sainte-Catherine, the roof of an office was blown into a nearby residence punching a large hole on the back wall.

5|$|The {{border area}} between Acadia and New England {{remained}} uncertain despite battles {{along the border}} throughout King William's War. New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine. There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay {{near the site of}} modern Castine, Maine, which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William's War. The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by Indians (primarily Abenaki and Iroquois), and the Hudson River–Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both <b>directions</b> <b>in</b> earlier conflicts. The threat of Indians had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war, but they still posed a potent threat to outlying settlements.|$|E
