40|$|In an ever {{changing}} market, ruminant {{milk and}} meat production must continually develop cost-effective ways to promote animal health, performance and product safety. Food safety and traceability, {{as well as}} animal welfare are beginning to play key roles in consumer decisions. However, these deliverables can often increase already excessive production costs meaning that producers must look to new technologies, such as nutritional solutions, in order to maximise production efficiency. The link between animal nutrition and health is well founded and now needs to be exploited further {{in order to ensure}} a progressive industry. It is becoming clear that nutritional influences at pivotal stages in dairy and beef production can positively impact rumen and gut health and, subsequently, performance. There has been particular focus on transition period and antioxidant nutrition, acknowledging the changing needs of the modern, <b>high-producing</b> <b>animal.</b> The threat of mycotoxins highlights the issue of climate change and its impact on modern animal production. Solutions are required that minimise or eliminate that threat if the issue is to remain and effective knowledge transfer initiatives must be integrated into all advisory services. 'Ruminant formula for the future: nutrition or pathology? Elevating performance and health' unites the relevant expertise of researchers from across the globe. Pertinent topics, such as calf management and cow lameness are discussed in conjunction with novel protocols aimed at the reduction of production pathologies and the promotion of rumen and gut health. This book is aimed at nutritionists, veterinarians, consultants and animal producers, as well as animal and biological science researchers and students...|$|E
40|$|Economic {{benefits}} of information technologies were assessed at farm level {{by means of}} a dynamic probabilistic simulation model. The model included biological performances with respect to oestrus detection and concentrate feeding. In this way, main {{benefits of}} activity meters, automated concentrate feeders and on-line automated parlour systems for recording of milk production and milk temperature could be estimated. In comparison with the default situation, improvement in oestrus detection from 50 % to 90 % increased gross margin by Dfl. 1. 28 per 100 kg fat and protein corrected milk (FPCM) per year under Dutch production conditions. This equals 8. 0 % of a farmer's typical net return to labour and management. Using an individual feeding system increased gross margin by Dfl. 0. 77 per 100 kg FPCM per year and the net return to labour and management by 4. 8 %. Feeders increased the frequency of concentrate provision from two to four times a day. Moreover, a more accurate performance-related concentrate provision was achieved from total daily amount in portions of 1 - 0. 1 kg. In addition feeders enabled the possibility of overcoming the limited concentrate intake for <b>high-producing</b> <b>animals</b> in the milking parlour {{in the beginning of the}} lactation. A more accurate milk production estimation increased gross margin and the net return to labour and management by Dfl. 0. 17 per 100 kg FPCM and 1. 1 % respectively. In the latter case equilibrium feeding was compared with a feeding method in which concentrate supply was based on an standard deviation of 5 % in the estimated energy requirements for milk production. The results of this study will be used to evaluate theoretically the economic viability of the investigated IT applications...|$|R
30|$|During {{lactation}} and gestation in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>animals,</b> methylneogenesis, DNA synthesis, cell division, epigenetic processes, {{and others}} important processes deeply depend on folate metabolism. While {{a supply of}} nucleic acids from microbial digestion might reduce {{the burden on the}} DNA cycle, gluconeogenesis and methylneogenesis is high in <b>high-producing</b> dairy <b>animals,</b> particularly during early lactation (Abbasi et al. 2018). However, in some cases, precursors of de novo synthesis of methylated compounds were found to be insufficient. In these cases, folate supplementation would improve the transport of one-carbon units. Consequently, a supply of both co-factors (folate and B 12) and methyl donors were essential for maximum dairy performance. Some studies reported that, in growing steers, duodenum folate concentrations were marginal, and non-gestating cattle had serum folate concentrations greater than that of gestating cattle (Arbeiter and Winding 1973; Tremblay et al. 1991). In dairy cows, total serum folate level was noted to decline by about 40 % within the 2  months prior to a calving (Girard et al. 1989). Changes in serum folate concentration provide signs as to the relationship between folate supply and folate utilization in tissues and the change in that relationship during different physiological stages. Folic acid supplementation increased the placental and colostral transmission of folate to the calf. Other effects on blood hemoglobin, growth, birth weight, and feed intake of the mother were not found to be significant during the 10  weeks prior to birth. Other studies reported that folic acid injection promotes a significant increase in milk protein content in multiparous cows, but has no significant effect in primiparous cows (Girard et al. 1995; Girard and Matte 1998). Folate and vitamin B 12 concentrations in plasma increased during dietary supplementation of both nutrients (Girard and Matte 2005). However, during dietary supplementation of cobalt, vitamin B 12 serum level during early lactation was lower in primiparous cattles than in multiparous cattles (Girard and Matte 1999). This study also reported that in early lactation in dairy cows, serum vitamin B 12 concentration was lower, but serum folate concentration peaked, particularly during folic acid dietary supplementation. However, the situation was reversed 8 – 12  weeks after lactation, when serum vitamin B 12 was higher than serum folate in supplemented cows (Girard and Matte 1999). Previous studies reported that folic acid is also synthesized by ruminal micro-organisms, but folic acid from ruminal-synthesis is about 16.5 – 21.0  mg/day (Santschi et al. 2005), less than the folic acid requirement estimated recommended for dairy cows by the National Research Council (35  mg/day) (NRC 2001). Furthermore, ruminal microorganisms degrade around >[*] 0 · 95 of supplemented folic acid in dairy cows rations (Santschi et al. 2005). Thus, rumen-protected folic acid (RPFA) is necessary for high-producing ruminants.|$|R
