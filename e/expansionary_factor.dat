The purpose of this dissertation is to assess the policy responses of the Nigerian monetary authorities to the oil price shocks of 1974 - 75 and 1979 - 80, in terms of the independence of monetary policy and the role of fiscal policy in determining liquidity and inflation. Some of the early studies have portrayed the increase in international reserves from increased oil revenues as the primary <b>expansionary</b> <b>factor</b> in the growth of liquidity following the oil boom. This position does not fully explain the role of government fiscal operations in determining change in the money stock. As additional explanations for the economic problems of the 1980 s, this study will suggest deficit financing and credit controls imposed on the private sector during this period. A simple quarterly macro-monetary model is developed, featuring a small open economy that is assumed to have a fixed exchange rate, with strict foreign exchange controls. An unexpected booming of oil revenues leads to an increase in net foreign assets,but this has no immediate monetary impact, because it is offset by a rise in government deposits with the central bank. On the other hand, there is a tendency for the public sector to expand its activity beyond the level that can be sustained by the revenues, or what can be absorbed by the developing economy. The government budget is financed mainly by borrowing from the Central Bank, and it is the method of deficit financing that generates excess liquidity, and inflation. A four-equation model is estimated by three-stage least squares, to test the interrelationships between oil revenues, budget deficits, money, real output and inflation. The results suggest that the Central Bank of Nigeria possessed some degree of short-run monetary control over the monetary base. Such control may have been compromised by extensive money-financed budget deficits after the first boom, and by credit controls that "crowded out" private investment after the second boom. This study indicates that Nigerian problems with inflation and external deficits in the 1980 s originate from the implementation of fiscal policy...|$|E
40|$|This study {{sought to}} {{understand}} the archaeology of the Zimbabwe Culture capital of Khami through synchronic and diachronic analyses of its material culture. The research employed a number of methodological approaches that included a review of historic documents, surveying and mapping, excavations, museum collection analysis, and artefact studies, in order to collect datasets from various sections of the site, including the walled and the nonwalled areas. The main indication {{is that there is}} a great deal of similarity in material culture distribution across the whole site. An analysis of objects by stratigraphic sequence exposes continuity and change in local and imported objects. Dry stone-wall architectural data suggests that the site was constructed over a long period, with construction motivated by a number of <b>expansionary</b> <b>factors.</b> The study confirms that Khami began as a fully developed cultural unit, with no developmental trajectory recorded at Mapungubwe or Great Zimbabwe, where earlier ceramic units influenced later ones. Consequently, this study cautiously suggests that Khami represents a continuity with the Woolandale chiefdoms that settled in the south-western parts of the country and in the adjacent areas of Botswana. On the basis of the chronological and material culture evidence, Khami is unlikely to have emerged out of Great Zimbabwe. However, more research is needed to confirm these emergent conclusions, and to better understand the chronological and spatial relationships between not just Woolandale and Khami sites but also Khami and the multiple Khami-type sites scattered across southern Zambezia...|$|R
40|$|MBA - WBSThe South African private {{healthcare}} {{industry has}} grown {{since the advent}} of a full democracy in South Africa (UNDP, 2007) and research into the end consumer choice preferences for private hospital facilities has yielded useful insights. This study looks at the end consumer choice preferences of the private hospital industry in South Africa. It is designed to aid private hospital facility managers with regards to decision making around strategic, marketing and <b>expansionary</b> decisions. Operational <b>factors</b> were intentionally excluded from this study, being outside the scope of the research. The research problem explores both tangible and intangible attributes that contribute to consumer decision making in those using purely private hospital facilities, on a walk-in, non-emergency basis. These attributes were identified from the literature review and comprised facility quality, location, price, access from the tangible side; and staff competence, staff attitude and brand recognition from an intangible perspective. Data was collected by means of a snowball, online questionnaire, which was designed on the basis of choice-based conjoint analysis. There were a total of 132 respondents of which 93 had valid responses. The questionnaire was first subjected to a qualitative pilot phase in which personal interviews were conducted by the researcher in order to screen and validate the questionnaire. Respondent’s demographics were widespread across most demographic groups recorded. Due to limited responses from certain demographic groups, however, this research has limited applicability for the lower income brackets, the elderly and those without medical insurance cover. Data was then analysed using applicable software, interpreted and placed into context. Key findings from this research are that tangible and intangible attributes account for an almost equal proportion of the decision making criteria, with iii staff competence, facility quality and location having the highest importance scores overall. Lowest importance scores for decision making attributes were for staff attitude and access, with price and brand ranking in the middle. Different demographic groups had statistically significant differences in attribute importances, namely across age groups with regards to staff competency, brand and price; across gender groups with regards to staff competency facilities and price; income brackets across staff competency, location and brand; and finally across those with dependants versus those without across staff competency and brand. This means that private hospital facility managers may have to tailor their strategic, marketing and expansionary plans according to their target markets. The underlying key finding that emerged from this research study was that, private hospital facility manager’s top priority should be making sure that the end consumer has absolute confidence in the hospital staff, followed by having high quality facilities and assuring location is taken into account when formulating strategic, marketing and expansionary strategies. If resources are limited they should be first channelled in these areas, although the other attributes examined in this research study do play a role and may be differentiating factors should all else be equal...|$|R
