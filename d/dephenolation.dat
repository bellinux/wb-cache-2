40|$|Process {{water and}} phenols ’ {{balances}} {{for the two}} processes of oil shale ther-mal treatment, Kiviter (in vertical retort) and Galoter (with solid heat car-rier) were compiled. Options of wastewater treatment in the Kiviter process were analyzed in more detail. Laboratory experiments of biological oxidation of the process water after the <b>dephenolation</b> stage without other effluents and municipal wastewater were carried out. Experiments indicated that the oil shale phenols are generally quite easily degradable when the need for phos-phorus is covered by added reagents. The experiments indicated that, com-pared to conventional aerobic bio-oxidation, the combined process, namely aerobic bio-oxidation with ozonation in re-circulation system, enabled to in-crease the efficiency of purification at relatively low ozone dosages. Applica-tion of ozone at moderate doses (up to 30 mg/L) improved the rate of pollut-ant removal. Injection of ozone at small dose – 2 mg/L – into the activated sludge in the bioreactor increased the sludge activity: the specific oxygen up-take increased about 15 – 20 %. The biologically treated wastewater {{can be used as}} some kind of technological water (cooling water) after chemical pre-cipitation and reduction of sulphate content. It can also been discharged to nature, but only after additional treatment to reduce nitrogen content and af-ter filtration to remove the residual suspended solids...|$|E
