25|$|Flowering trees {{form the}} basis of territories in this species. Territorial {{behavior}} includes growling and the spreading of wings. During antagonistic behavior, individuals maintain spacing with wrists/thumbs sparring, bites, and loud vocalizations. When moving to a suitable resting place after landing, an individual may fight with conspecifics along the way. A roosting flying fox is positioned upside down with its wings wrapped up. When <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> warm, a flying fox fans itself with its wings. Roosting bats are restless until midmorning.|$|E
25|$|As {{the player}} takes over a rival families' {{businesses}} and kills their men, their vendetta level will rise. If <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> high, a mob war will break out. This results in {{members of the}} opposing family attacking the player on sight, and attempting to bomb Corleone owned businesses, rackets, warehouses and hubs. The only way to win a mob war is to bomb a rival family business or bribe an FBI agent to distract the opposing family until the vendetta level has lowered.|$|E
25|$|It {{should be}} noted that a high void {{coefficient}} does not necessarily make a reactor inherently unsafe, as some of the fission neutrons are emitted with a delay of seconds or even minutes (post-fission neutron emission from daughter nuclei), so steps can be taken to reduce the fission rate before <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> high. However, it does make it considerably harder to control the reactor (especially at low power) and makes it imperative that the control systems are very reliable and the control room personnel (regardless of rank or position) are rigorously trained in the peculiarities and limits of the system. Neither of these requirements were in place at Chernobyl: since the reactor's actual design bore the approval stamp of the Kurchatov Institute and was considered a state secret, discussion of the reactor's flaws was forbidden, even among the actual personnel operating the plant. Some later RBMK designs did include control rods on electromagnetic grapples, thus controlling the reaction speed and, if necessary, stopping the reaction completely. The RBMK at Chernobyl, however, had manual control rods.|$|E

500|$|Urinary tract {{infection}} (UTI) {{is another}} risk {{that may not}} display the usual symptoms (pain, urgency and frequency); it may instead be associated with worsened spasticity. The risk of UTI, likely the most common complication in the long term, is heightened by use of indwelling urinary catheters. Catheterization may be necessary because SCI interferes with the bladder's ability to empty when <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> full, which could trigger autonomic dysreflexia or damage the bladder permanently. [...] The use of intermittent catheterization to empty the bladder at regular intervals throughout the day has decreased the mortality due to kidney failure from UTI in the first world, {{but it is still}} a serious problem in developing countries.|$|E
500|$|If danger threatens, {{the chicks}} crouch under a plant or any cover that offers, their dappled brown down merging {{into the desert}} scene. The parents are very {{vigilant}} in defence of their family. If a jackal approaches, an adult gives a warning cry and all crouch down and freeze. Usually the enemy fails to notice them and passes by. If <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> close, one of the parents tries to lure it away by flapping along the ground, pretending to be injured and helpless. When the jackal has been led far enough away, the adult [...] "recovers" [...] and flies off. After three or four days, the chicks can be left alone while both parents visit the water hole, and the chicks can guide them back with their [...] "queet - queet" [...] cries.|$|E
2500|$|Despite the {{seemingly}} random {{nature of the}} enemies, their movements are strictly deterministic, which players have used to their advantage. In an interview, creator Toru Iwatani stated that he had designed each enemy with its own distinct personality {{in order to keep}} the game from becoming impossibly difficult or boring to play. More recently, Iwatani described the enemy behaviors in more detail at the 2011 Game Developers Conference. He stated that the red enemy chases Pac-Man, and the pink enemy aims for a position in front of Pac-Man's mouth. The blue enemy is [...] "fickle" [...] and sometimes heads towards Pac-Man, and other times away. Although he claimed that the orange enemy's behavior is random, in actuality it alternates from behaving like the red enemy when at some distance from Pac-Man and aiming towards the lower-left corner of the maze whenever <b>it</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> close to him.|$|E

But I guess we know who he is." ...|$|R
2500|$|Over {{the years}} EastEnders has {{typically}} featured {{a number of}} elderly residents, {{who are used to}} show vulnerability, nostalgia, stalwart-like attributes and are sometimes used for comedic purposes. The original elderly residents included Lou Beale, Ethel Skinner and Dot Cotton. Over the years they have been joined by the likes of Mo Butcher, Jules Tavernier, Marge Green, Nellie Ellis, Jim Branning, Charlie Slater, Mo Harris, Patrick Trueman, Cora Cross, Les Coker, Rose Cotton, Pam Coker, Stan Carter, Babe Smith, Claudette Hubbard, Sylvie Carter, Ted Murray and Joyce Murray. Focus on elderly characters has decreased since the show's inception. The programme has more recently included a higher number of teenagers and successful young adults in a bid to capture the younger television audience. This has spurred criticism, most notably from the actress Anna Wing, who played Lou Beale in the show. She commented, [...] "I don't want to be disloyal, but I think you need a few mature people in a soap because they give it backbone and body... if all the main people are young it gets a bit thin and inexperienced. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> lightweight." ...|$|E
2500|$|Staind's vocalist Aaron Lewis {{rejected}} the nu metal label, saying, [...] "if we get called a 'nu metal' band one more time, I don't {{even know what}} I'm going to do!" [...] Chino Moreno, vocalist of Deftones, {{rejected the}} nu metal label saying [...] "We told motherfuckers not to lump us in with nu metal because when those bands go down we aren't {{going to be with}} them". As Deftones abandoned the nu metal sound of their early work, Moreno tried to distance himself from nu metal bands and began to criticize the bands and their albums, including Korn's 2002 album Untouchables; he said, [...] "As Korn go on, it's the same things—bad childhoods and mean moms. <b>It</b> <b>gets</b> <b>too</b> old after a while. How old is Jonathan ? Thirty? How long has it been since he lived with his parents?" [...] Davis responded saying, [...] "Obviously, Chino hasn't listened to the words on the rest of my albums because they're nothing about my parents or my childhood." [...] Moreno also said, [...] "A big problem for me was opening for Limp Bizkit and Linkin Park, two bands that wouldn't exist if it weren't for me, straight up!". Mike Shinoda of Linkin Park spoke about the nu metal label in an interview with NME, saying [...] "We never held the flag for nu-metal—it was associated with frat rock. Arrogant, misogynistic, and full of testosterone; we were reacting against that." [...] Wes Borland of Limp Bizkit said that he [...] "never liked or condoned" [...] the term [...] "nu metal" [...] in any way, and said he does not understand [...] "how so many bands that sound nothing alike can be put into" [...] the nu metal genre. Mike Wengren of Disturbed said that he doesn't think Disturbed [...] "were ever a nu-metal band to begin with".|$|E
