40|$|During the Late Roman and Byzantine period, natron {{glass was}} made from its raw {{materials}} in {{a limited number of}} primary production centres in Egypt and Syro-Palestine. For the earlier Hellenistic and Roman period, no primary furnaces have been found and the location of primary production during this era remains unclear. Ancient authors such as Strabo and Pliny the Elder suggest that glassmaking sands were found near the River Belus (Israel), in Egypt, near the mouth of the Volturno River (Italy) and also in Spain and France. However, primary production {{in the western part of}} the Mediterranean is not supported by any direct archaeological evidence and possible sand raw materials from these regions have never been evaluated for their suitability to produce glass. In this study the possible existence of a Roman primary glass industry in the western Mediterranean is investigated, based on the occurrence of suitable sand raw materials. 178 beach sands from Spain, France and Italy are evaluated for their suitability for glass production by calculating the composition of hypothetical glasses made from these sands and comparing them to Roman natron glass. The results show that good glassmaking sands are far from common. Only a very limited number of the 178 beach sands analysed would produce a glass with major and minor elemental compositions within the ranges of Roman imperial natron glass. The rest of the sands analysed are unsuitable for glass production in their present form due to their insufficient SiO 2, high Al 2 O 3 and Fe 2 O 3, and either too low or too high CaO contents. If the sand raw material was too low in CaO, extra lime could be added to the glass batch in the form of shell or limestone. This was taken into account in a second calculation. Overall, six limited areas could be define where suitable sand raw materials would have been available to the Roman glassmaker. Good glassmaking sands occur in the Basilicata and Puglia Regions (SE Italy), and Tuscany (W Italy). After the addition of an extra source of lime, sands from the Huelva Province (SW Spain), the Murcia Region (SE Spain) and from the Provence (SE France) would also produce glasses with a typical Roman composition. The suitability of the suggested sands was checked by performing a series of melting experiments, which provide further insights in the way Roman glass makers would have had to prepare their raw materials and the used batch recipes. Because of the complex nature of Roman natron glass, the provenance determination of this material remains one of the most challenging problems in the field of archaeometry. In the past decades, several attempts have been made to determine the provenance of ancient glass based on major, minor and trace elemental compositions, rare earth element patterns and isotopic signatures of O, Pb, Sr and Nd. Unfortunately, the major elemental composition of natron glass is relatively uniform and specific objects can almost never be uniquely assigned to their origin. Although the use of Sr and Nd isotope ratios and trace element signatures as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> has proven promising, there are still unknown factors. The bulk of the Sr in natron glass is believed to have been incorporated with the lime bearing material. Where the lime was derived from Holocene seashell, the Sr isotopic composition of the glass would reflect that of modern seawater. Where the lime was derived from geologically aged limestone, the signature would reflect that of seawater at the time the limestone was deposited, possibly modified by diagenesis. However, also other minerals in the sand, such as feldspar and mica, can influence the Sr budget of the glass batch. Nd in natron based glass originates from the non-quartz mineral fraction of the silica raw material, which is most probably sand. It is well known that the &# 949;Nd value of deep-sea sediments in the eastern Mediterranean varies significantly due to the varying sediment influx from the Nile (fluvial), the Sahara (eolian) and the European continent (fluvial) and shows a pronounced E-W gradient from as high as - 1 at the mouth of the River Nile and the coasts of Egypt and Israel, to - 12 south of Sicily. In the western Mediterranean, the distribution of the Nd isotopic composition is less well known. Only very few results for river particulates and deep sea sediments are published and they all show rather low &# 949;Nd value of around - 10. Although it is not possible to directly compare the Nd isotopic signature of glass to sea-floor sediment, such significant differences between the easternmost part of the Mediterranean Sea and the rest of the basin offer a great potential in tracing the origins of sand raw materials used in primary glass production. Trace elements in raw natron glass are related to the accessory minerals in the glassmaking sand. The mineralogy of the heavy mineral fraction of a sand deposit is determined by the composition of the source rocks and is often a good indication of its origin. However, also the other raw materials, such as the natron and the lime, introduce traces of specific elements to the glass batch. Especially the transition metals, such as Mn, Co, Cu, Sb and Pb, are strongly influenced by the addition of colouring or decolouring agents. Recycling of glass cullet, including small quantities of coloured glass, results in elevated concentrations of these elements. In this study, the applicability of Sr and Nd isotopes and trace elemental analysis for provenancing natron glass is evaluated. A database of Sr and Nd isotopic compositions of possible sand raw materials from the western Mediterranean is presented, as a means of comparison for the growing number of isotopic studies on ancient glass. It is shown that the 87 Sr/ 86 Sr ratio in natron glass is significantly influenced by the silicate fraction of the sand used and does not always provide a clear indication of the lime source used. The 143 Nd/ 144 Nd isotope ratio and &# 949;Nd value of sands is a good indicator for their geological (and sometimes geographical) provenance. The variation of the isotopic composition of Nd in beach sands along the Mediterranean coasts of Spain, France and Italy is presented, and the relation between the Nd isotopic signatures and geologically distinct regions is explained. The use of the isotopic signature of Nd as a proxy for the source of silica in glass is, however, not always straightforward because of the possible overlap of signatures from different suppliers. However, when used in combination with trace element geochemistry, raw natron glass and sand raw materials from the known production centres in the Levant can be readily distinguished from the suitable glassmaking sands identified in the western part of the Mediterranean. Ti, Cr, Sr, Zr and Ba are shown to be the most useful elements for provenancing natron glass. A comparison between the range of the Nd isotope ratios of suitable glassmaking sands and archaeological natron glass from around the Mediterranean, indicates primary production in both the east and west. Hellenistic and Roman (2 nd century BC to 4 th century AD) natron glasses show a wide range of Nd isotopic compositions. This may suggest raw glass production all around the Mediterranean Sea but can also reflect intense recycling of glass from a few big glass producers scattered around the Mediterranean. During the Late Roman, Byzantine and Early Islamic period (5 th to 7 th century AD) large scale raw glass production appears to be restricted to the eastern Mediterranean. nrpages: 148 status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|About sixty well sorted (average {{diameter}} 0. 8 cm) volcanic clasts with tholeiitic affinities {{were found}} {{in the midst of an}} lower Maastrichtian conglomerate outcropping close to Bovec (Slovenian Basin, NW Slovenia) and interpreted as evidence of a deltaic system. The clasts appear to be variably spilitized (i. e. albitization of plagioclase and anomalous Na content), however, they do not show any evidence of sub-solidus recrystallization. The analysis, carried out on nineteen selected samples, point out similar petrographic textures and a strong arc-type chemical signature (i. e. deep Nb negative anomaly, quite low La/Sm and Th/Zr ratio and normative corundum). Chemical data allow us to distinguish, for comparable grade of evolution, variable LREE contents which cannot be related only to crystal fractionation or to a variable grade of crustal contamination, but require compositional differences in the protolithic sources. To have an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> <b>of</b> these clasts, and about their related hydrographic system, their chemical features were compared to those of similarly evolved pre-Maastrichtian magmatic rocks of different ages, locations and geological settings, mainly belonging to the Dinaridic-Carpathian region.

In particular Bovec clasts show strong chemical similarities with metabasites from the ophiolitic complexes of the Evros (Rhodopes) and Vardar Zone, while they appear quite different from both the more depleted samples from Bükk Mountains (Hungary), and all the calc-alkaline compositions considered.

A successful forensically-sound sample extraction, mounting and backside processing methodology was developed to expose the underside of a microcontroller circuit's floating gate transistor tunnel oxide, allowing probing via AFM-based electrical scanning probe techniques. Scanning Kelvin probe microscopy has thus far proved capable of detecting the presence of stored charge within the floating gates beneath the thin tunnel oxide layer, to the point of generating statistical distributions reflecting the threshold voltage states of the transistors.

In an earlier inventory they had been registered as part of the Goeldi collection, but as there was no apparent connection with Goeldi, these skins were assumed to be part of an acquisition of birds from John Gould mentioned in the Natural History Museum Bern (NMBE) committee minutes of 1862 (Güntert et al., 1993). Subsequent investigation, however, revealed that these hummingbirds and other specimens were indeed given by the BMNH to Goeldi at the Museu Paraense in Brazil in September 1895, shortly after Goeldi had been appointed director of this institution.

We focus on ontologies as a mean of knowledge representation and present a novel approach to representation <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> metadata in knowledge bases, relying on an OWL 2 design pattern. We also outline an abstract method <b>of</b> propagation <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> metadata during the reasoning process. ...|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 2010 In {{the field}} <b>of</b> Human-Computer Interaction, <b>provenance</b> {{refers to the}} {{complete}} history and genealogy <b>of</b> a document. <b>Provenance</b> {{can be useful in}} identifying related resources, such as different versions of the same document or resources used {{in the creation of a}} new document. Though methods <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> collection and applications for provenance have been studied, no studies have documented the frequency <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> events in typical computer use. We conducted a study of knowledge workers at Intel and used event-logging software to track provenance events as they occurred in the workplace over several weeks. We also interviewed knowledge workers to evaluate the effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> cues for document recall. Our data shows that provenance relationships are quite common, and provenance helps users recall more about their documents and understand the context of their workflows. Through a detailed analysis of the challenges facing knowledge workers, their typical work practices, and the utility <b>of</b> <b>provenance,</b> we argue that provenance can be useful in applications like desktop search...|$|R

Until {{the discovery of}} Neuquenraptor, all dromaeosaurids {{had been found in}} North America, Europe or Northern China / Mongolia, and scientists believed that dromaeosaurids only inhabited Laurasia, i.e. the Northern Hemisphere. South America however, during the Mesozoic became part of Gondwana. The find of Neuquenraptor provides some possible <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the degree of isolation between the Northern and Southern hemispheres.|$|R
40|$|Provenance, {{from the}} French word „provenir ‟ meaning "to come from", {{describes}} the lineage <b>of</b> an entity. <b>Provenance</b> is critical information in eScience to accurately interpret scientific results. Though information provenance {{has been recognized}} as a hard problem in computing science (British Computing Society, 2004), many fundamental research issues in provenance {{have yet to be}} addressed. A common provenance model with well-defined formal semantics to facilitate interoperability <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> metadata from different sources has not been defined. Another important issue is the lack of a systematic study <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query characteristics across multiple applications. A classification or taxonomy <b>of</b> the <b>provenance</b> queries will not only help to better understand provenance metadata, but will also enable the definition <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators. Finally, while provenance for a user or an application is a specific view over all available provenance metadata, a provenance management system that supports provenance storage as views has not been implemented. In this paper we propose a novel <b>provenance</b> algebra consisting <b>of</b> a common <b>provenance</b> model called provenir, defined in description logic based W 3 C Web Ontology Language (OWL-DL), along with a set <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators derived from the classification <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> queries. We also introduce a practical provenance storage solution using materialized views over a generic relational database system. Our approach takes advantage <b>of</b> <b>provenance</b> query operators and well-defined indices to efficiently process complex provenance queries over very large datasets. To support our claims we present an evaluation of both performance and scalability aspects of our initial implementation. To {{the best of our knowledge}} this is the first provenance management system that supports the complete process from a formal provenance model and query operators to storage and efficient queries over provenance data. 1...|$|R
