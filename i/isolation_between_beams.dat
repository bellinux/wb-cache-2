40|$|The latest {{trend for}} the {{multimedia}} satellite systems is operation at the Ka-band, 17. 7 - 20. 2 GHz downlink and 27. 5 - 30. 0 GHz uplink. This will enable several new services {{and lead to}} cheaper and smaller terminals for the end-consumer. The common configuration for the onboard antennas for these systems are reflector antennas with a cluster of feeds, from which each feed creates a spot beam on earth. In order to realize many and efficient spot beams, the feeds in the cluster must be small and tightly packed. Furthermore, {{in order to increase}} the frequency usage, the complete frequency band (and thus also the total footprint of all spot beams) is subdivided into smaller frequency channels, which are shared between the spot beams. This leads to stringent requirements on <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> <b>beams</b> with the same frequency. It is also evident that smaller feeds normally have low efficiency caused by increased spillover losses outside the reflector. The objective of this work is to address feed solutions that can satisfy the requirements on ground coverage and beam isolation in both the 20 and 30 GHz bands. This work was initiated with a trade-off study of different types of common and possible horns for these systems in which the bandwidth of aperture efficiency and cross polarization, mechanical manufacturability and usability in space were considered and discussed. The conclusion was that medium to high efficiency horns with wide or dual 20 / 30 GHz bandwidth are most suitable. One solution which was considered interesting was the hard horn, which was proposed as feed for the satellite cluster-fed reflector antennas already in 1988, but not truly investigated before now. The hard horn is most easily realized by using longitudinally corrugated walls filled with a dielectric. Therefore, the work continued by analysis of the corrugated hard horn and the use of it as feed in cluster-fed multi-beam satellite antennas for Ka-band. The study first considered hard horns with conical shape so that they support a single mode. They were investigated by using a classical-type open-ended waveguide model based on homogenization of the corrugated wall region. Thereafter, the multi-mode hard horns were introduced {{in order to reduce the}} size. They were studied using both an analytical approach, an in-house mode matching code (which is also based on homogenized hard walls), and commercial FDTD software. The finite period of the corrugated horn was investigated using a Finite Element Method program. A dual band multi-mode hard horn was designed, manufactured and measured. The present studies show that the hard horn is a good fed candidate for cluster-fed multi-beam satellite antennas in particular when dual band operation is needed, such as e. g. 20 and 30 GHz. The multimode hard horn is actually a compact new feed alternative in any single- or dual-band reflector system...|$|E

Specifically, this study models a real cloud-hosted service that has multiple components that can be deployed to multiple tenants in a way that would guarantee the required degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants.

30|$|Research work on multitenancy has {{acknowledged}} that there are varying degrees of isolation tenants accessing a multitenant cloud-hosted service [11 – 14]. Chong and Carraro discuss three approaches to managing multi-tenant data, and it is stated that {{the distinction between the}} shared data and isolated data is more of a continuum, where many variations are possible between the two extremes [11]. Three multitenancy patterns have been identified which express the degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants accessing a shared component of an application [3]. These patterns are referred to as shared component, tenant-isolated component and dedicated component. The shared component represents the lowest degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants while the dedicated component represents the highest.

We did not observe any sexual <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> species or between strains within species by multiple-choice tests. Significant difference in the courtship index was detected between these two species, but males and females of both species showed no discrimination against heterospec-ific partners. Significant quantitative variations in cuticular hydrocarbons between these two species were also found, but the cuticular hydrocarbons appear to play a negligible role in both courtship and sexual <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> these two species. In contrast to the evident postzygotic isolation, the lack of sexual <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> these two species suggests that the evolution of pre-mating isolation may lag behind that of the intergenomic incompatibility, which might be driven by intragenomic conflicts...|$|R

40|$|One {{of the key}} {{concerns}} of implementing multitenancy (i. e., serving multiple tenants with a single instance of an application) on the cloud is how to enable the required degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants, so that the required performance of one tenant does not affect other tenants. There is little research which provides empirical evidence on the required degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants under different cloud deployment conditions. This paper applies COMITRE (COmponent-based approach to Multitenancy Isolation Through request RE-routing) to empirically evaluate the degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants enabled by multitenancy patterns for cloud-hosted Version Control System (VCS). We implemented three multitenancy patterns (i. e., shared component, tenant-isolated component, and dedicated component) by developing a multitenant component using the FileSystem SCM plugin integrated within Hudson. The study revealed that dedicated component provides the highest degree of <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> tenants (compared to shared component and tenant-isolated component) in terms of error% (i. e., the percentage of errors with unacceptably slow response times) and throughput. System load of tenants showed no variability, and hence did not influence the degree of tenant isolation for all the three multitenancy patterns. We also provide some recommendations to guide an architect in implementing multitenancy isolation on similar VCS tools like Subversion and CVS. Tertiary Education Trust Fund, Nigeria...|$|R

The study revealed among other things that a component deployed based on dedicated component offers the highest degree of isolation (especially for database transactions where support for locking is enabled). Tenant isolation based on performance (e. g., response time) favoured shared component (compared to resource consumption (e. g., CPU and memory) which favoured dedicated component).

40|$|Patterns of {{reproductive}} <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> species may {{provide insight into}} the mechanisms and evolution of barriers to interspecific gene exchange. We used data from published interspecific hybridization experiments from 14 genera of angiosperms in order to test for the presence of asymmetrical barriers to gene exchange. Reproductive isolation was examined at three life-history stages: the ability of interspecific crosses to produce seeds, the viability of F 1 hybrids, and the fertility of F 1 hybrids. Statistically significant asymmetries in the strength {{of reproductive}} <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> species were detected in all genera and at each of the three life-history stages. Asymmetries in seed production may be caused by a variety of mechanisms including differences in stigma/style lengths, self compatibility and differential fruit abortion. Asymmetries in post-zygotic isolation are probably caused by nuclear-cytoplasmic interactions. Asymmetrical reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> plant taxa may have important implications for the dynamics of hybrid zones, the direction of genetic introgression and the probability of reinforcement...|$|R
40|$|Speciation {{proceeds}} when {{gene exchange}} is prevented between populations.

These reproductive barriers may result from intrinsic genetic incompatibilities between populations, from extrinsic environmental differences between populations, {{or a combination of}} both mechanisms. We investigated the potential barriers to gene exchange between three adjacent ecotypes of an Australian wildflower to determine the strength of individual barriers and the degree of overall <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> populations. We found almost complete <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> the three populations mainly due to premating extrinsic barriers. Intrinsic genetic barriers were weak and variable among populations. There were asymmetries in some intrinsic barriers due to the origin of cytoplasm in hybrids. Overall, these results suggest that reproductive <b>isolation</b> <b>between</b> these three populations is almost complete despite the absence of geographic barriers, and that the main drivers of this isolation are ecologically based, consistent with the mechanisms underlying ecological speciation...|$|R
