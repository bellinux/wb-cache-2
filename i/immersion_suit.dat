50|$|An <b>immersion</b> <b>suit,</b> or {{survival}} suit (or more specifically an immersion {{survival suit}}) {{is a special}} type of waterproof dry suit that protects the wearer from hypothermia from immersion in cold water, after abandoning a sinking or capsized vessel, especially in the open ocean.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{interior}} conventional lifeboat temperatures on the thermoregulatory responses of participants wearing <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> were investigated. Two different environmental conditions were investigated: the interior air temperature and relative humidity levels {{found in a}} conventional lifeboat that relies on passive ventilation (2 ̆ 01 cConventional 2 ̆ 01 d); and those proposed {{to be in a}} next generation lifeboat that will have an active ventilation system (2 ̆ 01 cNext-Generation 2 ̆ 01 d). Participants performed three hour tests in both the Conventional and Next-Generation condition. The Conventional condition produced a significantly greater increase (P < 0. 05) in the rate of sweat production, rate mean skin temperature increase and gastro-intestinal increase, heart rate, and physiological strain index values compared to the Next-Generation condition. The Conventional condition caused an amount of sweat accumulation sufficient to dampen the underclothing to a level that would cause a significant reduction in predicted survival time. Heart rate, gastro-intestinal temperature and physiological strain index values continued to trend upwards during the Conventional condition suggesting that the level of thermal stress was uncompensable by the thermoregulatory systems of the participants which is supported by the air temperature and relative humidity levels being at a critical environmental limit in which heat balance cannot be achieved. It is concluded that the interior environmental conditions of conventional lifeboats will result in a level of thermal stress that cannot be compensated for by people wearing <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> which will result in increasing levels of physiological strain.

40|$|Abstract: The {{objectives}} {{of the present study}} were to define the lowest ambient air and cabin temperatures at which aircrews wearing immersion protection are starting to experience thermal discomfort and heat stress during flight operations, and to characterize during a flight simulation in laboratory, the severity of the heat stress during exposure to a typical northern summer ambient condition (25 °C, 40 % RH). Twenty male helicopter aircrews wearing <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> (insulation of 2. 2 Clo in air) performed 26 flights within an 8 -month period at ambient temperatures ranging between – 15 and 25 °C, and cabin temperatures ranging between 3 and 28 °C. It was observed based on thermal comfort ratings that the aircrews were starting to experience thermal discomfort and heat stress at ambient and cabin air conditions above 18 °C and at a WBGT index of 16 °C. In a subsequent study, seven aircrews dressed with the same clothing were exposed for 140 min to 25 °C and 40 % RH in a climatic chamber. During the exposure, the aircrews simulated pilot flight maneuvers for 80 min followed with backender/flight engineer activities for 60 min. By the end of the 140 min exposure, the skin temperature, rectal temperature and heart rate had increased significantly to 35. 7 ± 0. 2 °C, 38. 4 ± 0. 2 °C and between 110 and 160 beats/min depending on the level of physical activity. The body sweat rate averaged 0. 58 kg/h and the relative humidity inside the clothing was at saturation {{by the end of the}} exposure. It was concluded that aircrews wearing <b>immersion</b> <b>suits</b> during the summer months in northern climates might experience thermal discomfort and heat stress at ambient or cabin air temperature as low as 18 °C...|$|R

40|$|Recent marine {{accidents}} {{have called}} into question the level of protection provided by immersion suits in real (harsh) life situations. Two <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> studies, one dry {{and the other with}} 500 mL of water underneath the suit, were conducted in cold water with 10 - 12 males in each to test body heat loss under three environmental conditions: calm, as mandated for <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> certification, and two combinations of wind plus waves to simulate conditions typically found offshore. In both studies mean skin heat loss was higher in wind and waves vs. calm; deep body temperature and oxygen consumption were not different. Mean survival time predictions exceeded 36 h for all conditions in the first study but were markedly less in the second in both calm and wind and waves. <b>Immersion</b> <b>suit</b> protection and consequential predicted survival times under realistic environmental conditions and with leakage are reduced relative to calm conditions.

40|$|The ISO Thermal Manikin Working Group {{has been}} tasked {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} to include thermal manikins in the standard for the current <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> approval testing. Five international laboratories {{were involved in a}} round robin test to measure the thermal resistance of immersion suits. The objectives are (1) to assess the uniformity of thermal resistance of suits derived from different manikins, to attempt to quantify the errors caused by methodology, tools and calculation methods; and (2) to evaluate the difference in thermal resistance output between manikin and human for the same <b>immersion</b> <b>suit.</b> The results of the tests conducted at National Research Council Canada, Institute for Ocean Technology (NRC-IOT) are documented in this report. In air, the thermal resistance of a manikin wearing only test clothing was determined to be 1. 408 clo. The thermal resistance of a manikin wearing a non-insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> and an insulated suit, with SOLAS RTD lifejacket over test clothing were 2. 442 clo and 2. 574 clo, respectively. In water, under uniform cooling conditions, the thermal resistance for a non-insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> and an insulated <b>immersion</b> <b>suit</b> were 0. 532 clo and 1. 355 clo, respectively. Under non-uniform cooling conditions, the results can be up to 25 % different from those conducted in uniform cooling conditions. It is concluded that under uniform cooling conditions, the constant temperature control mode of thermal manikins and the parallel method can be used to determine thermal resistance. Further research and development are needed before thermal manikins could be used with confidence for suit evaluation under non-uniform cooling conditions. To provide the scientific evidence that manikins can be used as an evaluation tool for immersion suits, {{it is also important to}} assess the thermal resistance of humans and manikins in the same environmental conditions, concurrently, in the same laboratory.
