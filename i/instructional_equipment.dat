40|$|Recent {{technological}} developments have {{contributed significantly to}} the <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment</b> available for use by high school agriculture teachers. Microcomputers, printers, VCRs, camcorders, satellite receivers, and computer modems have become available for use in high school programs. Coinciding with the increased availability of <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment,</b> the extent to which instructional technologies are being used is of concern to agricultural educators. McCarney (1987) advocated shifting education from a labor-intensive emphasis to a capital-intensive emphasis. He indicated that this shift could best be accomplished by utilizing technologies such as computers and video cassette recorders for instructional purposes. Others have suggested that the use of instructional technologies should support and empower the learner. Wedman (cited in Mihalevich, 1989) suggested that the appropriate use of instructional technologies {{is one of the most}} important considerations educators will face in the 1990 s. Rosenfeld (1986) noted that keeping up- _ with technology is like chasing a moving target and identified problems in adjusting programs and obtaining needed equipment. He further noted that in 1984, legislation was enacted that: [...] . explicitly addressed and responded to the impacts of technological change. Technology was no longer treated as an unseen force acting on labor market demand but as a force with known dimensions that should be factored into vocational education instructional policies (p. 13) ...|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} encompasses three essays that {{examine the}} extent to which parental loss and social programs affect the health, education and time allocation of children in developing countries. The first chapter asks the question of whether early life public health interventions have lasting or long term impact on children's human capital development. In order to answer this question, this chapter investigates the long term impact of the safe motherhood program in Indonesia on later cognition and schooling outcomes of children when they are age 11 to 17 years. The paper further investigates this question by examining the impact of the program based on exposure that began during a particular year. The findings suggest that the safe motherhood program had an impact on adolescent cognition and schooling. In particular, the program impact is relatively large and significant for those children who began exposure to the program at age 2 or younger, or not yet conceived. These estimates are robust to a series of robustness and specification checks. The results are also in general consistent with the findings in biological literature that suggest the importance of {{the first two years of}} life in shaping outcomes later in life. The second chapter examines the question of how parental loss or absence affects child well-being. While the strategy of many papers in the literature is to use parental death due to HIV/Aids to examine this question, this chapter uses the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami as a plausibly exogenous source of variation in parental death. In addition, the paper uses a unique longitudinal dataset that has baseline information on the same sample of individuals interviewed after the tsunami. Also, given rich data, the paper is able to look at various dimensions of child well-being which include school attendance, post-secondary aspirations, time allocation as well as educational attainment and marriage decisions for older children. The paper provides an in-depth analysis by examining the impact of parental death by age and gender of the child as well as looking at the impact in the short term and longer term. The results suggest that death of both parents, which has been little explored in the literature, has a large, negative impact on the human capital accumulation of both males and females. The loss of father alone led older males (aged 15 to 17 at the time of tsunami) to acquire less education compared to same age males whose both parents survived, while no effect is found on younger males aged 9 to 14. Furthermore, the results suggest that maternal death has little impact on schooling outcomes but does affect time allocation of children. Finally, the third chapter examines the impact of a unique bilateral grant-aid program which provided typhoon-resistant schools and <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment</b> to the Philippines. The results suggest that the presence of both the typhoon-resistant schools and <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment</b> programs had a positive impact on the educational attainment of both men and women. The availability of <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment</b> program alone also increased the educational attainment of men but it does not seem to have had substantive effect on women. On the other hand, the availability of typhoon-resistant schools without the <b>instructional</b> <b>equipment</b> package did not have any impact on schooling outcomes of either the males or females. Except for the falsification exercise which suggests that there could be other underlying trends which may not be fully captured by the specifications, the estimates are in general robust to the inclusion of individual level characteristics, accounting of other concurrent national government's programs, restricting to municipalities in the typhoon belt region and accounting for municipality-specific trends. The findings suggest the importance of not only expanding access to schooling through increased availability of schools or classrooms (particularly, those that are resistant to natural disasters) but also the importance of improving the quality of learning through the availability of school resources that aide in students' learning in developing countries.

40|$|AbstractImprovement {{of teacher}} quality {{is at the}} focal point of reform studies of {{education}} systems. Especially in the recent years PISA test organised by OECD and its results bring up the issue of rethinking about education of teachers in many countries. As in many European countries also in Turkey, initial teacher education is at higher education level. Regardless of the school levels, teacher education has been carried out at the higher education level since 1974 it is a norm in Turkey. In Turkish higher education system with the new arrangement in 1981 all higher education institutions are gathered under the umbrella of universities. In this context, teacher education institutions under Ministry of National Education (MoNE) then affiliated to the universities. In the following years that teacher education affiliated to universities new arrangements have been done. The most comprehensive one is the arrangement of 1997. This arrangement determined current teacher education model in Turkey and with this model, secondary education programmes became masters’ degree programmes (5 years) and concurrent model transfered to consecutive model. By the same arrangement an emphasis put to subject matter methodology and practice at the schools and a committee founded, ÖYMK (National Comittee of Teacher Education) by participation of all stakeholders. By updating studies performed between the years 2006 - 2008 especially pre-primary education and primary education (1 - 8 th grades) programmes were revised and secondary education programmes in teacher education were shifted to concurrent model. These new arrangements have mainly focused on model and education programmes. However, research findings in Turkey about teacher education mostly draw attention to quality of the academic staff, over courseload of academic staff, physical infrastructure (classroom, laboratory etc.), inadequacy of information technologies and <b>instructional</b> <b>equipments.</b> So improvement of the quality of teacher education requires a good monitoring and evaluation system, not only model and education programmes but also improvement of the quality of academic staff, physical and technological infrastructure, practical conditions at the schools and taking other series of measures...|$|R

40|$|Foreign {{language}} learning lends itself naturally {{to the use}} of media. Linguists stress the primacy of speech over writing in language: children can listen and speak before they learn to read and write and all languages of the world are spoken, but not all have a writing system. Accordingly, foreign-language ed-ucators have been heavily involved in the use of audio equip-ment. They welcomed the first audio device, the phonograph, and have immediately adopted other advances in audio tech-nology such as magnetic tape and digital media. (Delcoque, An-nan, & Bramoullé, 2000). Unfortunately, the history of the use of technology to teach languages has not been duly noted by historians of educational technology. Paul Saettler, in his defini-tive The Evolution of American Educational Technology, only makes passing references to foreign-language teaching, and lan-guage laboratories are granted merely one paragraph (p. 187).

40|$|This study uses {{data from}} the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) {{to gain a better}} {{understanding}} of how academic performance and resources vary across rural–urban school communities in Australia. While it is well known that schools in rural areas have difficulty recruiting and retaining teachers, the degree to which schools in larger sized communities across Australia also face this problem is less understood. Moreover, very little is known about the degree to which shortages of <b>instructional</b> materials and <b>equipment</b> are associated with rural–urban location. The analysis includes 353 schools across eight community types that range in size of < 1, 000 people in small country towns to more than a million people in large capital cities. School principals reported the degree to which instruction in their school is hindered by a shortage of resources, which include qualified teaching staff and <b>instructional</b> materials and <b>equipment.</b> The findings highlight the extent to which school resources vary across geographic location, as reported by school principals. Principals of schools in the centre of large cities were the least likely to report that shortages of teaching staff or instructional materials hinder learning, while principals in rural and remote communities were the most likely to report that such shortages hinder instruction. These differences closely mirror student PISA academic performance and school socioeconomic composition. PISA data indicates that schools located in small rural communities have the lowest socioeconomic profiles, the lowest academic performance and the largest shortages of teaching staff and instructional materials, while schools in central neighborhoods of large cities enjoy the highest socioeconomic profiles, the highest academic performance and the fewest shortages...|$|R
