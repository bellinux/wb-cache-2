50|$|The {{successful}} ADC effort {{also attracted}} {{another sort of}} support. The U.S. Army pressured the CIA into allowing the introduction of Operation White Star training teams into the ADC program. The White Star teams were subsets of U.S. Special Forces A Teams. They founded one such ADC program apart from Momentum, placing it on the Bolovens Plateau in southern Laos, and dubbed it Operation Pincushion. However, the Green Berets did not enjoy quite the training success as the PARU had. They found that their raw Hune recruits were not as aggressive as the Hmong. Just as the Hmong were, the Hune were scorned by lowland Lao, and thus neglected by the Royalist government. The new Hune soldiers had difficulty loading the M1 Garand. They also lacked the physical strength to <b>hand</b> <b>carry</b> the 57 mm recoilless rifle from place to place. They also lacked the ethnic cohesiveness of the Hmong. Out of the 12 ADC companies trained in Pincushion, half of one deserted, and another was wracked to uselessness by internal dissension.|$|E
