500|$|According to Ibn Ishaq's {{biography}} of Muhammad, {{one woman who}} had thrown a millstone from the battlements during the siege and killed one of the Muslim besiegers, was also beheaded along with the men. 'Ã'isha, one of Mohammad's wives, is cited as describing the woman as laughing and chatting with her during the massacre, down to the moment her name was called out: 'By Allah,' she said,' that is me.' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> 'You poor soul, what is to happen to you?' She said:"I must be killed." [...] "Why?" [...] I asked her. [...] "For something I did," [...] she answered. She went away and was beheaded. By Allah,('Ã'isha adds) I shall never forget her cheerfulness and her great laugh when {{she knew that she}} was to be killed.' ...|$|E
500|$|The first writers {{assigned}} to the script were twins Julius and Philip Epstein who, against the wishes of Warner Brothers, left at Frank Capra's request early in 1942 {{to work on the}} Why We Fight series in Washington, D.C. While they were gone, the other credited writer, Howard Koch, was assigned; he produced thirty to forty pages. When the Epstein brothers returned after about a month, they were re{{assigned to}} Casablanca and—contrary to what Koch claimed in two published books—his work was not used. The Epstein brothers and Koch never worked in the same room at the same time during the writing of the script. Koch later commented, [...] "When we began, we didn't have a finished script... Ingrid Bergman came to me and said, 'Which man should I love more...?' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> 'I don't know... play them both evenly.' You see we didn't have an ending, so we didn't know what was going to happen!" [...] In the final budget for the film, the Epsteins were paid $30,416, and Koch earned $4,200.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know--we don't know. And oh, Willie, {{she went}} out {{yesterday}} morning! <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> 'Nettie,' <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> 'you're mighty fine for a morning call.' 'Fine clo's for a fine day,' she said, and that was her last words to me!--Willie!--the child I suckled at my breast!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't quite understand," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> draw <b>her</b> out further, although, in fact, I {{had more}} than a glimmering of what she meant.|$|R
6000|$|... 'You have a {{forgiving}} spirit, dear friend,' she said, accenting {{the last}} word in recollection of what <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> 'A truly Christian disposition!' ...|$|R
60|$|Then I gave it up, and sat {{trying to}} {{remember}} what <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> the evening before, and hoping I had not committed myself.|$|R
6000|$|... "I said to {{her that}} her {{question}} revealed a total misconception {{of the nature of}} my present relations with my son. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that I had no relations with him at all, and that nothing had passed between us for months. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that my hands were spotlessly clean of any attempt to make him make up to you. <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> that I had taken from Poynton what I had a right to take, but had done nothing else in the world. I was determined that if I had bit my tongue off to oblige you I would at least have the righteousness that my sacrifice gave me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Here's physic for {{untimely}} fruit," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> alas for me, Early that morn in fond salute; And in {{my grave}} I now would be.|$|E
6000|$|... "Pack your trunk," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> one December day, {{with an air}} of high authority. [...] "We {{are going}} East in {{continuation}} of our wedding trip." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Will {{you have}} some iced tea?" [...] asked the Madonna; and then {{her side of the}} table sank down gently and <b>I</b> <b>said</b> yes <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at an angle of forty-five degrees.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you mean}} by well?" [...] I asked, for I felt a little hurt that, after what <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about Percy, she should ever dream of the {{possibility}} of my accepting any one else.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about it. She {{would make}} such a terrible fuss, {{there would be no}} getting away from her. We must ask Mr. Parrot <b>to</b> tell <b>her,</b> after the vessel has set sail." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ... I woke, [...] With {{the first}} word I had to spare [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "Beneath your Cloak [...] What's that which on your arm you bear?" [...] 1807.|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{will forgive}} me," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{in a low}} tone, [...] "but I believe {{that you are in}} trouble. Can I help you? Don't be afraid to tell me if I can." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But it isn't anybody else, {{and that}} makes it impossible. Sometimes I think it might be if I would only say so to myself, and then all that <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> about you comes up----" ...|$|E
6000|$|We {{walked home}} {{together}} {{as far as}} Stanhope Gate. Our sense of doom oppressed us. [...] "And yet," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{as we left the}} doorstep, [...] "I don't doubt Mrs. Le Geyt really believes she IS a model stepmother!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "If {{you knew}} {{me as well}} as I know myself," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> {{reaching}} <b>to</b> <b>her</b> both my hands, [...] "you would know that my gratitude towards you is deeper than the deepest depths of the earth." [...] She took one of my hands.|$|R
6000|$|... 'O Miss Elfride! <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> myself 'tis <b>her</b> sperrit! We didn't dream o' you {{not coming}} home last night. You didn't say {{anything}} about staying.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Kea," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> one day, as she {{sat still}} sewing away at a pure white dress in the room by my side, [...] "do you know {{anything}} of your English relations--your father's people?" ...|$|E
6000|$|In this way, or {{some other}} way, I bribed her {{to go with me}} to Madison, to the Sanitarium. [...] "You must not run home," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Make a fair trial of the Institution." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> simply. [...] "I do {{not think}} that these papers are worth five thousand. Let me tell you what I came here for. I am a {{messenger}} from the Duke of Rowchester." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bury her, then!' {{returned}} he. 'But {{why did she}} do it? I am sure <b>I</b> <b>said</b> nothing <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> throw {{herself into}} the oven.' ...|$|R
60|$|My {{daughter}} had already noticed that Rosanna went {{about her work}} like {{a woman in a}} dream. I now added to this observation, that she also listened and spoke like a woman in a dream. I doubted if her mind was in a fit condition to take in what <b>I</b> had <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't {{understand}} you," [...] she said, after evidently trying hard, {{and trying}} in vain, {{to discover the}} meaning of the words <b>I</b> had last <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Come, child," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as {{gently as}} I could. [...] "Go pack, and quit this home of misery. And be easy. For if any man in Mondolfo {{attempts}} to hasten your going, he shall reckon with me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am deeply}} sorry," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "that I cannot remember. I could explain, but fear {{you would not}} understand. You will not concede Pinkhammer; and I really cannot at all {{conceive}} of the--the roses and other things." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "See here, Miss Trevor," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> one {{day after}} we had become more or less intimate, [...] "of course it's none of my business, but you didn't feel very badly after the Celebrity went away, did you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You mean--what I intimated to your cousin," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> trying <b>to</b> make <b>her</b> look at me. [...] "That was {{the devil}} in me. Only it's true." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Come," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> hoping <b>to</b> take <b>her</b> {{a moment}} out of herself, [...] "Come with me {{into one of}} the flies; I have {{something}} to tell you." ...|$|R
6000|$|She said nothing, and glancing round, I {{discovered}} that she was walking away, her fingers clasped before her, her eyes cast down, and looking profoundly dejected. Jumping up, I hurried after her. [...] "Listen!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> coming <b>to</b> <b>her</b> side. [...] "Do {{you know that there}} are others in the world like you who would understand your speech?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Sebastian is a {{wonderful}} man," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> as I entered her ward on my rounds at night. [...] "His coolness astonishes me. Do you know, he watched {{you all the time}} you were lying asleep there as if nothing were the matter." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{eight o'clock}} he once more tiptoed {{in to see}} if she still slept, and finding her in the same {{position}} his heart softened with pity. [...] "She must have been completely tired out, poor little mother! I'm afraid what <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> worried her." ...|$|E
6000|$|Her joy in my return, so accusing in its tenderness, led me {{to declare}} that I would never again leave her, not even for a month. [...] "You may count on me hereafter," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "I'm going to quit {{traveling}} and settle down near you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I was liberally {{paid for}} my old {{attendance}} here," [...] <b>I</b> <b>said,</b> <b>to</b> soothe <b>her,</b> [...] "in being apprenticed, and I have asked these questions only {{for my own}} information. What follows has another (and I hope more disinterested) purpose. In humoring my mistake, Miss Havisham, you punished--practised on--perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention, without offence--your self-seeking relations?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'I? No, {{not that}} I know of. <b>I</b> merely <b>said</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{that it was}} {{dangerous}} to drive those Highland bullocks--as it IS. She turned in such a way, and said--"I suppose you think I'm afraid {{of you and your}} cattle, don't you?" [...] So I asked her [...] "why," [...] and for answer she flung me a back-hander across the face.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, Caddy," [...] <b>said</b> <b>I,</b> turning <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> [...] "perhaps {{you will}} not be {{surprised}} when I tell you, my dear, that there never has been any engagement--" ...|$|R
