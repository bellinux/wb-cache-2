5|$|Like their {{relatives}} in the Elapidae family, {{the majority of the}} Hydrophiinae species are highly venomous; however, when bites occur, venom injection is rare, so envenomation symptoms usually seem nonexistent or trivial.

Nevertheless, all sea snakes should be handled with great caution.|$|E
