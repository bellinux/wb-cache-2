40|$|Bivariate <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> can be {{used for}} the {{detection}} of recurrent chromosome abnormalities in tumor cells. For this purpose 2 cell lines originally derived from Ewing's sarcomas and 4 cell lines from peripheral neuroectodermal tumors were used. The characteristic t(11; 22) was known to be present in 5 cell lines. The remaining cell line was known to have a variant t(2; 11; 22; 21) translocation. Metaphase chromosomes were stained with the fluorescent dyes Hoechst 33258 and Chromomycin A 3 and analyzed subsequently using bivariate flow cytometry. The resulting bivariate flow karyotypes of the tumor cells were normalized by a standardized procedure using a computerized method and compared with a reference flow karyotype of normal chromosomes. In 5 cell lines two recurring abnormal chromosome peaks were identified at positions expected for the der(11) and der(22) chromosomes characteristic for the reciprocal t(11; 22) (q 24;q 12). In the remaining cell line with the variant t(2; 11; 22; 21), only the peak representing the der(22) was identifiable.

In addition to uniform normalization of normal and abnormal <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes,</b> the main purpose is detection of structurally abnormal chromosomes in often complex karyotypes of tumor cells. The method, which has been implemented in a computer program, consists of a comparison of individual chromosome peaks with the positions of peaks in the <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> constituted by normal chromosomes and takes into account the natural variability in base composition of normal chromosomes among healthy individuals. Flow-karyotypes are normalized using an iterative fitting procedure, using corrections for (1) amplification of HO and CA fluorescence, (2) cross-talk between the fluorescence signals of HO and CA, and (3) offset of the HO and CA origin. <b>Flow</b> <b>karyotypes</b> of two cell lines, one with a simple deletion and the other with more complex karyotypic changes, were analyzed.

40|$|V 79 Chinese hamster {{cells were}} {{irradiated}} in G 0 phase with 200 kV X rays or 14 MeV neutrons, and dose-response curves were determined for three end points: chromosome damage detected by flow cytometric analysis of chromosomes isolated from metaphase cells in irradiated cultures; loss of clonogenic capacity; and induction of dicentric, tricentric, and ring chromosomes. The changes {{observed in the}} <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes</b> from irradiated cultures were quantitatively evaluated by computer analysis. Estimates of the frequencies of chromosome lesions were derived from {{an analysis of the}} flow cytometric measurements by means of a comparison with model calculations simulating the effect of chromosome changes on <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes.</b> The results indicate that lesions assayed by flow cytometry occur three times more frequently than lethal lesions, while the chromosomal structural changes detected by microscopic analysis were about 10 times less frequent than the lesions detected by flow cytometry.

After staining with the DNA-specific fluorochromes Hoechst 33258 and Chromomycin A(3), univariate and bivariate flow-cytometry histograms showed 15 clearly resolved peaks corresponding to individual chromosome types {{or groups of}} chromosomes with similar DNA contents. The <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> was closely similar to a histogram of DNA content measurements of Feulgen-stained chromosomes made by microdensitometry.

The data indicate that flow cytometric analysis of plant karyotypes enables accurate, statistically precise chromosome classification and karyotyping of cereals. There was little overlap between individual flow-histogram peaks, so the method is useful for flow sorting and the construction of chromosome specific-recombinant DNA libraries.

Replicate bivariate flow karyotypes of chromosomes isolated from lymphocytes from 10 individuals demonstrated that person-to-person variability was significantly greater than run-to-run variability. The total variability was sufficiently small that it did not interfere with classification of normal chromosome types except chromosomes 9 through 12 and chromosomes 14 and 15. Furthermore, the variability was generally smaller than 1 / 600 th of the mitotic genome, so that one-band rearrangements should be detectable in bivariate flow karyotypes...|$|E

Although genome sequencing in Afrotheria is not complete, extensive homology with human has been revealed by chromosome painting.

Genome GC content shows a negative correlation with size, indicating that this is due to differences in the amount of AT-rich sequences. Low genome GC content and small variance in chromosome GC content are characteristic of aardvark and elephant and may be associated with the high degree of conserved synteny, suggesting that these are features of the Afrotherian ancestral genome...|$|E

Suspensions of intact chromosomes were prepared by mechanical homogenization of synchronized root tips after mild fixation with formaldehyde. Histograms of relative fluorescence intensity (<b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes)</b> obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes were characterized and the chromosome content of all peaks on wheat <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> was determined for the first time. Only chromosome 3 B could be discriminated on <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes</b> of wheat lines with standard karyotype. Remaining chromosomes formed three composite peaks and could be sorted only as groups. Chromosome 3 B could be sorted at purity > 95 % as determined by microscopic evaluation of sorted fractions that were labeled using C-PRINS with primers for GAA microsatellites and for Afa repeats, respectively. Chromosome 5 BL/ 7 BL could be sorted in two wheat cultivars at similar purity, indicating a potential of various wheat stocks for sorting of other chromosome types. PCR with chromosome-specific primers confirmed the identity of sorted fractions and suitability of flow-sorted chromosomes for physical mapping and for construction of small-insert DNA libraries. Sorted chromosomes were also found suitable for the preparation of high-molecular-weight DNA. On the basis of these results, it seems realistic to propose construction of large-insert chromosome-specific DNA libraries in wheat.

40|$|Pesticide {{contamination}} {{of drinking water}} supplies has increased over the past decade. A major concern is how exposure to combinations of low levels of pesticides, especially herbicides, could affect public health. Flow cytometric analysis was performed to determine the clastogenic potential of herbicide interaction on Chinese hamster ovary (CHO) cells. The cells were exposed to atrazine, simazine, cyanazine, and all possible combinations of these chemicals for 48 hr. Two concentrations were used for each sample: the U. S. EPA maximum contamination level (MCL) and the highest contamination level found in Illinois water supplies. Nuclei were isolated from the cells and analyzed by flow cytometry. The effects of clastogenicity were measured by the coefficient of variation (CV) of the G 1 peak of whole cells and the change in CV of the largest chromosome in the <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype.</b> At both levels tested, atrazine caused chromosomal damage to the CHO cells. Simazine was observed to induce whole-cell clastogenicity but not <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> damage. Cyanazine did not induce any measurable chromosomal damage in either analysis. Each of the herbicides, although all three were triazines, had different effects with respect to chromosome damage as measured by flow cytometry. CHO cells treated {{with a combination of}} atrazine and simazine, or atrazine and cyanazine, were observed to have whole-cell and <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> damage. This damage was, however, equal to or less severe than the damage caused by either atrazine or simazine alone. No synergy was observed.

To optimize the results, we improved the detection efficiency for centromeres in two ways. A higher efficiency was obtained first by elongation of the chromosomes and second by introducing a high resolution lens system for laser beam focusing. In the two-parameter flow karyotype of CI and DNA content of human chromosomes, distinct peaks are produced {{not only by the}} larger chromosomes 1 - 8 and X, but by the smaller nonacrocentric chromosomes 9 - 12 and 16 - 20 as well. As the chromosomes 9 - 12 cannot be distinguished by other <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> methods, we discriminated and sorted chromosomes 12 and 10 from 9 and 11 to investigate the capacity for the separation of chromosomes in this group.

40|$|This paper {{highlights}} two improvements of {{the on-line}} centromeric index (CI) {{analysis for the}} detection of chromosome abnormalities. On-line CI versus DNA content analysis of an EBV-transformed cell line, with a deletion (11) (p 13 p 15. 1), of a patient with aniridia and Wilms' tumour demonstrates the first improvement of the method of on-line CI analysis for <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> and sorting; a reciprocal translocation, insertion, or deletion can, when the cell type contains not more than a few of these types of abnormalities, be traced to the p-arm or q-arm of the relevant chromosome. On-line CI analysis was also performed with chromosomes isolated from a transitional cell carcinoma of the bladder. Cytogenetic analysis of this cell line showed numerous chromosomal abnormalities. Chromosomes of this cell line were also karyotyped by bivariate flow cytometry using a different set of parameters: Hoechst 33, 258 fluorescence intensity (HOfl) versus chromomycin A 3 fluorescence intensity (CAfl). A comparison of these results reveals the second improvement of the CI method {{for the detection of}} chromosome abnormalities; bivariate analysis of CI versus propidium fluorescence (PIfl) are complementary to bivariate analysis of HOfl versus CAfl.

40|$|The {{effects of}} DNA {{substitution}} by the thymidine analogue 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) on cell cycle progression and mkronucleus induction were studied in different mammalian cell cultures. Simultaneous flow cytometric measurements of DNA content and side scatter of nuclei in Chinese hamster embryo (CHE) cells revealed a concentration-dependent temporary {{block in the}} G 2 /M phase of the first cell cycle. NTH 3 T 3 cells and human amniotic fluid fibroblast-like cells, on the contrary, did not show any cell cycle disturbances {{in the presence of}} BrdU. Micronucleus frequency increased as soon as CHE cells started to divide and reached a plateau when all cells have divided. The height of this plateau was almost equal for 60 and 100 /tM BrdU. This saturation of micronucleus induction was due to a saturation of BrdU incorporation into DNA already at a dosis of 60 /tM as shown by the BrdU/Hoechst quenching technique. Indirect immuno-fluorescent staining of kinetochores with CREST antibodies revealed that nearly all BrdU-induced micronuclei were kinetochore-negative suggesting the presence of acentric chromosome fragments in these micronuclei. DNA distri-butions of micronuclei measured by flow cytometry showed several peaks representing micronuclei which contain DNA fragments of defined sizes induced by non-random breakage of chromosomes 1 and X as verified by <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> and C-banding...|$|E

Twenty four wheat SSR markers were tested for their position on chromosomes of Ae. umbellulata and Ae. comosa using PCR on DNA amplified from flow-sorted chromosomes and genomic DNA of wheat-Ae. geniculata addition lines, respectively. Six SSR markers were located on particular Aegilops chromosomes using sorted chromosomes, thus confirming the usefulness of this approach for physical mapping. The SSR markers are suitable for marker assisted selection of wheat-Aegilops introgression lines.

Histograms of fluorescence intensity (flow karyotypes) obtained after the analysis of DAPI-stained chromosomes consisted of three peaks. Of these, one represented chromosome 3 B, a small peak corresponded to chromosomes 1 A and 6 A, and a large peak represented the remaining 11 chromosomes. Chromosomes sorted onto microscope slides were identified after {{fluorescence in situ hybridization}} (FISH) with probes for GAA microsatellite, pSc 119. 2, and Afa repeats. Genomic distribution of these sequences was determined {{for the first time in}} durum wheat and a molecular karyotype has been developed for this crop. <b>Flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> in double-ditelosomic lines of durum wheat revealed that the lines facilitated sorting of any arm of the wheat A- and B-genome chromosomes. Compared to hexaploid wheat, flow karyotype of durum wheat is less complex. This property results in better discrimination of telosomes and high purities in sorted fractions, ranging from 90 to 98 %. We have demonstrated that large insert libraries can be created from DNA purified using flow cytometry.

40|$|Application of the {{fluorescent}} DNA-intercalator propidium iodide for stabilization of the mitotic chromosome structure during isolation of chromosomes from V 79 Chinese hamster cells and subsequent staining with the fluorochromes 33258 Hoechst or DAPI allowed bivariate <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> of isolated chromosomes. Fluorescence of 33258 Hoechst bound to isolated chromosomes containing 5 -bromodeoxyuridine (BrdUrd) was quenched {{in comparison with}} the fluorescence of control chromosomes. Despite structural relationship and similarity of both absorption and fluorescence spectra of DAPI and 33258 Hoechst, reduction of fluorescence of DAPI-stained isolated chromosomes was not observed, by contrast with findings in conventional cytological metaphase preparations. It could be obtained, however, by preirradiation of the chromosomes with near-UV in the presence of DAPI. This led to a progressive destruction of the chromosomes. Destruction also occurred without BrdUrd, though at a slower rate. Preirradiation of chromosomes in the presence of 33258 Hoechst hardly affected the integrity of the chromosomes. Preirradiation of a 33258 Hoechst solution and its subsequent use as a stain resulted in a considerably decreased fluorescence of chromosomes. For DAPI this effect was small. Thus, whereas 33258 Hoechst itself is much more sensitive to near-UV irradiation than DAPI, DAPI bound to DNA in chromosomes renders the DNA much more sensitive to irradiation than 33258 Hoechst bound to DNA. Presumably, these differences can at least partly be reduced to the different molecular sizes of the dye...|$|E
40|$|Maternal and {{paternal}} homologues of many chromosome types can be differentiated on {{the basis}} of their peak position in Hoechst 33258 versus chromomycin A 3 bivariate flow karyotypes. We demonstrate here the magnitude of DNA content differences among normal chromosomes of the same type. Significant peak-position differences between homologues were observed for an average of four chromosome types in each of the karyotypes of 98 different individuals. The frequency of individuals with differences in homologue peak positions varied among chromosome types: e. g., chromosome 15, 61 %; chromosome 3, 4 %. Flow karyotypes of 33 unrelated individuals were compared to determine the range of peak position among normal chromosomes. Chromosomes Y, 21, 22, 15, 16, 13, 14, and 19 were most heteromorphic, and chromosomes 2 - 8 and X were least heteromorphic. The largest chromosome 21 was 45 % larger than the smallest 21 chromosome observed. The base composition of the variable regions differed among chromosome types. DNA contents of chromosome variants determined from flow karyotypes were closely correlated to measurements of DNA content made of gallocyanin chrome alum-stained metaphase chromosomes on slides. Fluorescence in situ hybridization with chromosome-specific repetitive sequences indicated that variability in their copy number is partly responsible for peak-position variability in some chromosomes.

The deletion estimates were used to develop an approximate scale for the genomic map in Xp 21. The bivariate flow karyotype results were compared with clinical and molecular genetic information on the extent of the patients' deletions, and these various types of data were consistent. The resulting map spans > 15 Mb, from the telomeric interval between DXS 41 (99 - 6) and DXS 68 (L 1 - 4) to a position centromeric to the ornithine transcarbamylase locus. The deletion sizing was considered to be accurate to +/- 1 Mb. The map provides information on the relative localization of genes and markers within this region. For example, the map suggests that the adrenal hypoplasia congenita and glycerol kinase genes are physically close to each other, are within 1 - 2 Mb of the telomeric end of the Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) gene, and are nearer to the DMD locus than to the more distal marker DXS 28 (C 7). Information of this type is useful in developing genomic strategies for positional cloning in Xp 21.

Many different instrumentation variables were explored and optimal settings for clear chromosome analysis and resolution were established. Row karyotypic analysis of chromosomes from normal human cell lines produced normal chromosome distributions with no marked abnormalities. Normal phytohemagglutinin-stimulated lymphocytes also produced normal chromosome histograms, and it was found that culture for 5 days was optimal for chromosome resolution. The WI- 38 SV cell line was found to be karyotypically unstable, and thus histograms were not obtainable with this method of analysis.

The position of this peak was found to vary significantly from individual to individual, correlating with the heterochromatin chromosomal polymorphism of the human Y chromosome. The sensitivity of the hybridization was such that, with a probe for a male-specific repetitive sequence, only 2, 500 sorted chromosomes were enough to obtain a clear, positive signal; 10, 000 were needed with a probe specific for a weakly repeated (maximum, 3 -fold) sequence of Y chromosome.

We established C. guereza (2 n= 44) chromosome paint probes by flow sorting and reciprocally hybridized them to human chromosomes. The bivariate <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype</b> of Colobus guereza was resolved into 22 peaks. Paints of C. guereza were hybridized to human metaphases and 32 clear signals were detected.

A comparison of these data with previous chromosome painting and banding supported the monophyly of Colobinae and their division in an African and an Asian clade. Pygathrix nemaeus is karyologically the most conservative colobine species studied and it probably diverged early after the separation of Asian and African colobines. In contrast, chromosome painting shows that Nasalis larvatus, often considered the most primitive and isolated colobine, is karyologically derived and phylogenetically nested within Asian colobines. Both the painting and banding data support the taxonomic grouping of Trachypithecus, but would exclude the purple faced leaf monkey and align this species with the Hanuman langur in Semnopithecus...|$|R
40|$|Flow sorting maize {{chromosome}} 1 {{and construction}} of the first chromosome 1 DNA Lambda library are described. Maize metaphase chromosome suspensions were prepared from synchronized seedling root tip cells of the maize hybrid line Seneca 60 and stained with propidium iodide for <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> and sorting. The observed flow karyotype was {{very similar to the}} predicted flow karyotype constructed based on published values for the relative chromosome sizes of Seneca 60. The estimated size of chromosomes from the peak for the chromosome 1 matched the expected size of maize chromosome 1. The peak for the chromosome 1 was well resolved from other peaks on the flow karyotype. An average of 7 / 103 chromosomes of chromosome 1 could be produced from 10 root tips. About 0. 6 million chromosomes of maize chromosome 1 were sorted and pooled based on the cytogram of fluorescent pulse area Vs fluorescent pulse width and stored at / 208 C in the freezer. DNA isolated from sorted chromosomes was good quality of more than 100 kb in size. Chromosome 1 DNA was partially digested with BamHI, dephosphorylated and ligated with arms of BamHI digested Lambda Dash vector. A total of 1. 2 / 105 independent recombinants with the average insert size 12. 6 kb was obtained. This library covered approximately 90 % of maize chromosome 1. Hybridization of cloned fragments with labeled maize genomic DNA showed that the high, middle, or low copy number DNA sequences presented in the different phage clones. PCR (polymerase chain reaction) using chromosome-specific primers confirmed the specificity of this library. The individual chromosome library is useful in plant genome mapping and gene isolation...|$|E
40|$|Using slit-scan flow cytometry, {{the shape}} of human {{metaphase}} chromosomes, as expressed in their centromeric index (CI), and the DNA content of the chromosomes {{have been used as}} parameters in bivariate <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping.</b> The resolution of the DNA vs CI flow karyogram of the larger chromosomes up to chromosome 13 is much higher than the resolution obtained in the DNA-based monovariate flow karyogram. Chromosome length appears to be an important factor in the resolution of the DNA vs CI-based flow karyogram. A method has been developed to obtain chromosomes in suspension that are long enough for adequate analysis. Several chromosomes that cannot be distinguished or are difficult to discriminate in the DNA-based karyogram can now be distinguished as individual peaks, e. g., chromosomes 1 and 2. The peak of chromosomes 9 - 12 can be separated into two peaks formed by chromosomes 9 and 11, and 10 and 12, respectively. The advantage of the system applied in this study is that the DNA vs CI analysis is performed on-line, allowing chromosomes to be sorted on the bases of their CI. Pulse shapes of the selected chromosomes can be recorded simultaneously with the transmission of the sorting command. The purity of the sorted fraction can be estimated from the off-line inspection of these pulse shapes. Fractions of chromosome 1 have been sorted out {{on the basis of the}} CI information, centrifuged on slides, fixed and subsequently banded with trypsin and Giemsa or hybridized with the chromosome 1 specific probe, pUC 1. 77. The observed purity under the selected conditions ranges from 80 %- 99 % and is in accordance with the estimates of the purities made on the basis of the simultaneously recorded pulse shapes. Fixation of the chromosome suspension prior to flow cytometric analysis and sorting appears to be essential for the preservation of their morphology and has no adverse influence on the resolution of Giemsa banding or on the quality of in situ hybridizatio...|$|E
40|$|The Philadelphia (Ph) chromosome, a {{characteristic}} cytogenetic marker of {{chronic myeloid leukaemia}} (CML), {{is caused by a}} reciprocal translocation juxtaposing the 3 ' region of the ABL gene onto the 5 ' region of the BCR gene. Due to conservation of the reading frame, but depending {{on the site of the}} breakpoint in the BCR gene, two alternatively spliced variants of the p 210 BCR-ABL mRNA (known as b 2 -a 2 and b 3 -a 2) are produced. To investigate whether there are any biological differences between these splice variants we have transfected the b 3 -a 2 or b 2 -a 2 cDNA into a murine myeloid cell line, 32 D. We have also included the previously prepared 32 Dp 210 cell line (which expresses the b 3 -a 2 transcript) in all of our comparisons. RT-PCR analysis indicated that transcription levels were comparable between the variants. Morphological examination of the cells expressing either of the BCR-ABL transcripts indicated that these cells were more mature with increased cytoplasm:nuclear ratios compared to the 32 D parental and 32 Dneo vector control cells. However, the 32 Dp 210 cells had a very different appearance from the other panel members and <b>flow</b> <b>karyotyping</b> indicated a clonal evolution and cytogenetic instability in these cells alone. At 10 (6) and 10 (7) cell doses all 32 D cells expressing BCR-ABL caused ill health and tissue infiltration in SCID mice with such rapidity that statistical analysis was not informative. However, at the 10 (5) and 10 (4) dosage levels there were similar survival rates between mice injected with 32 Db 2 -a 2 or 32 Db 3 -a 2 while mice injected with 32 Dp 210 had a significantly shorter survival time. The study of this 32 D cell line panel indicated that there were no overt differences in the biological properties conferred by the b 3 -a 2 or b 2 -a 2 transcripts to the 32 D cells although these transcripts were able to confer in vitro and in vivo biological effects. This panel of BCR-ABL expressing 32 D cells provides a useful model for CML disease progression studies...|$|E
40|$|Dasypyrum villosum (L.) Candargy (sin. Haynaldia villosa) is {{an annual}} wild diploid grass species (2 n = 2 x = 14; genome VV) {{belonging}} to the Poaceae family, which {{is considered to be}} an important source of biotic and abiotic stress resistance genes for wheat breeding. Enhanced characterization of D. villosum chromosomes can facilitate exploitation of its gene pool and its use in wheat breeding programs. Here we present the cytogenetic identification of D. villosum chromosomes on slide by fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), with the GAA simple sequence repeat (SSR) as a probe. We also describe the isolation and the flow cytometric analysis of D. villosum chromosomes in suspension, resulting in a distinguished <b>flow</b> <b>karyotype.</b> Chromosomes were <b>flow</b> sorted into three fractions, according their DNA content, one of which was composed of a single type of chromosome, namely 6 V, sorted with over 85 % purity. Chromosome 6 V is known to carry genes to code for important resistance and seed storage characteristics, and its isolation represents a new source of genetic traits and specific markers useful for wheat improvement...|$|R
40|$|We have {{analyzed}} three de novo chromosome 16 rearrangements—two with a 16 p+ chromosome and one a 16 q+—none {{of which}} could be fully characterized by conventional cytogenetics. In each case, <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes</b> have been produced, and the aberrant chromosome has been isolated by flow sorting. The origin of the additional material has been ascertained by amplifying and labeling the DNA of the abnormal chromosome by degenerate-oligonucleotide-primer–PCR and hybridizing it in situ to normal metaphase spreads (reverse chromosome painting). Both 16 p+ chromosomes contain more than 30 Mb of DNA from the short arm of chromosome 9 (9 p 21. 2 -pter), while the 16 q+ contains approximately 9 Mb of DNA from 2 q 37. The breakpoints on chromosome 16 have been localized in each case; the two breakpoints on the short arm are at different points within the terminal band, 16 p 13. 3. The breakpoint on the long arm of chromosome 16 is very close to (within 230 kb of) the 16 q telomere. Determination of the regions of monosomy and trisomy allowed the observed phenotypes to be compared with other reported cases involving aneuploidy for these regions...|$|R
40|$|The 18 q- {{syndrome}} {{is one of}} several terminal deletion disorders that occur in humans. Previous G-banding studies suggest that the loss of a critical band, 18 q 21. 3, results in mental retardation, craniofacial anomalies, and metabolic defects. However, it is difficult to reconcile the consistent loss of a single region with the large variability in clinical phenotype. The {{purpose of this study was}} to reassess the extent of chromosomal loss in a cohort of 17 18 q- syndrome patients by using fluorescent-activated chromosome sorting, PCR, and FISH. Bivariate <b>flow</b> <b>karyotypes</b> revealed heterogeneity among the deletions; they ranged in size from 9 to 26 Mb. To confirm this heterogeneity at a molecular level, deleted and normal chromosomes 18 of six patients were collected by flow sorting, preamplified by random priming, and assayed for marker content by the PCR. This analysis defined five unique breakpoints among the six patients. We conclude that the terminal deletions in the 18 q- syndrome occur over a broad region spanning the interval from 18 q 21. 2 to 18 q 22. 2. Our results suggest that the variability in clinical phenotype may be more representative of a contiguous-gene syndrome with a baseline deficit of 18 q 22. 2 -qter than of the loss of a single critical region within 18 q 21. 3...|$|R
