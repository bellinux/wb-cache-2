Physical capital, economic policy changes and the ethnic war are also evaluated due to their substantial importance. This study uses a framework encompassing both the neoclassical and endogenous growth model. The impact of education is assessed through a quality adjusted human capital stock measure. The returns to investment in education are positive but significantly lower than those found for other developing economies. Unlike the case of most developed economies, higher returns from investment in physical capital cannot produce any sizable positive externalities. The war has had the expected negative effect on output, and the results on economic policy changes are inconclusive. The results indicate a need for an appropriate strategy to allocate resources on education to improve its returns to the economy...|$|E

Thus, economists try {{to explore the}} possible reasons of different patterns of {{economic growth}} among countries. It is widely accepted that once dominant Neo Classic approach to economic growth has failed to explain these differences so far. Since the earlier times of economics science, human capital has been considered the most important component of production.

The most recent growth models suggest that country’s human capital, foreign trade policy, the level of financial development and public expenditures are highly influential on economic growth.

40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to develop a political economy of public funding of education that accounts for the large disparities observed across countries in the share of GNP allocated to public education. In a general equilibrium overlapping generations model in which parents care about their children's lifetime utility the rational and forward looking agents vote for a level of public funding of education. The model mirrors the observed cross-country disparities in the share of GNP allocated to public funding of education. This share increases with per capita income levels as well as with the fertility rate and it decreases with the degree of inequality in the economy. For higher levels of inequality the model can generate a politico-economic equilibrium where private and public <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education</b> coexist.

40|$|In this study, the {{relationship}} between education and health that are accepted {{as an indicator of}} human capital and economic growth is tested empirically. The study aimed at decomposing {{the relationship}} between human capital (using health index and education index as a proxy) and economic growth using time series data from 1971 - 2011 in Ethiopia using modern econometrics technique. Long-run relationship among variables is confirmed through Johnson co-integration analysis whereas the long-run and short-run dynamics are observed by VECM specification. For causality purpose VECM based causality tests are employed. The finding indicates {{that in the long run}} <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education</b> and health would affect further economic growth. Hence policy makers and / or the government should strive to create institutional capacity that increase school enrolment and improved basic health service by strengthening the infrastructure of educational and health institutions that produce quality manpower.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the effects of}} educational mismatch on wages in the Spanish labour market since the mid-nineties. First we study the evolution of returns to education and then we estimate returns to education {{in terms of the}} match between the worker’s schooling and the job requirements. The results indicate that returns to education have declined since the mid-nineties. One also finds that the return associated with the job’s required education is greater than that corresponding to the worker’s actual schooling, and that the return on an additional year of attained education is positive b ut less than that of an additional year of required education. From a policy perspective, the existence of educational mismatch points to inefficiencies in the allocation of the educational resources. <b>Investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education</b> can positively contribute to alleviate the unemployment problem in Spain, but taken into account the existence of educational mismatch it also becomes necessary to introduce structural reforms in order to adapt the job structure to a model of production based on knowledge so that the more highly qualified workers can find a job that corresponds to their educational level.

40|$|Households in Egypt, {{like many}} {{developing}} countries, spend substantially on tutoring. According to the World Bank (2002), aggregate household spending on tutoring at the pre-university level represents the largest household education expense (even compared to spending on private school tuition and fees). According to the Economist Intelligence Unit (1996), {{it is not}} uncommon for households with children in the secondary education level to spend up to 25 % of annual income on tutoring. Observing a lot of parents deciding to invest in tutoring does not necessarily imply that there are corresponding high returns to tutoring. There may be imperfect information on payoffs, especially given that some of the returns are long-term, and that parents’ decisions may be affected by peer effects rather than by information on payoffs. It is therefore important to find out if such an investment pays off in terms of better education outcomes or if these resources would be better spent on improving the quality of the formal schooling system.

The results show that some proxy of educational variable such as years of schooling, primary educational attainment, and economic growth has significant and positive effect on human capital development. In contrast, secondary and tersiary educational attainment has negative and insignificant relationship with human capital development. This term is a paradox in economic development supported by some previous researches. The same case also occured in the investment of health; that is per capita consumption has no significant and positive relationship with human capital development.

The empirical {{results from this study}} have confirmed that the main key factors for attracting high level of FDI include: efforts to improve the education levels and skills of the people, relatively welldeveloped infrastructure, stable and predictable policy and macroeconomic environments, higher GDP growth rates over the past decade, favorable trade policies, market size and political stability. However, the evidence shows that the level of human capital and infrastructure are below the threshold level in SSA to play a positive role in attracting FDI and materialize a structural change in the economy. Thus, <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education</b> and infrastructure should be taken as development priorities in SSA. Additionally, the study confirms that FDI is a complement not a threat to domestic investment/local firms. The study also reveals that ‘middle-income ’ SSA countries attract FDI better than ‘low-income’ SSA countries, perhaps because of their human capital and relatively better physical infrastructure.

Although some papers have estimated regressions to link educational outcomes and violence, no formal models have been developed yet. A theoretical model is crucial to understand the different channels through which violence affects education. Three channels are identified. First, violence can affect directly the utility of households and, therefore, it may modify the consumption of education. Second, extreme violence can destroy physical capital and create uncertainty, which will lower investment and production. In the long run, destruction of physical assets and drop in investment impact the income of households who in turn must reduce consumption and cutback investments in education. Third, violence can modify the rates of return of education, and therefore, can change the <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education.</b> We find violence indeed exerts a toll on education.

One part of the literature emphasizes the role of the financial system in promoting this type of agents’ economic performance as long as it attracts them to the use of financial intermediation, making available to them the use of financial services and technologies, both in deposits and credit. Another trend in the literature studies specific characteristics of liquidity constrained agents. This study empirically identifies how bancarization influences poverty and <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> in the case of families; and economic performance and the number of firms, in the municipal level in Colombia for the period 1995 - 2002. When studying these effects we control for local variables such as public spending in investment, homicide rate and guerrilla conflict. The period of study was characterized by the end of an economic boom and recession, which influences our econometric results. This study shows that banking developments affect households’ education decisions and firms’ performance at the municipal level; it was also found that non performing loans are associated with the {{decrease in the number of}} firms, but a relationship between loans and the creation of firms was not present. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between investment in education and in life-expanding investments, in a simple two-period model in which individuaIs are liquidity constrained in the first period. We show that under low leveIs of health and capital, investments in human capital and in health are complement: since the probability of survival is small, there is littIe incentive to invest in human capital; therefore the return on health investment is also low. This reinforcing effect does not hold for higher leveIs of health or capital, and the two investments become substitute. This property has many consequences. First, subsidizing health care may have dramatically different effects on private investment in human capital, depending on the initial leveI of health and capital. Second, the assumption that mortality is endogenous induces an increase in inequality of income: since health investment is a normal good, the return on education is also lower for poor individuaIs. Third,in a non-overlapping generation madel with non-altruistic agents, the hea 1 th leveI {{of the population has}} strong consequences on growth.

40|$|The {{education}} {{policy has been}} reviewed {{in the light of}} the goal of national development and priorities set from time to time. In its Resolution on the National Policy on Education in 1968, the government emphasized quality improvement and a planned, more equitable expansion of educational facilities. The need to focus on the education of girls was stressed. The National Policy on Education was reformulated in 1986 (NPE- 1986) and updated in 1992. The 1986 NPE provided a comprehensive framework for the development of education up to the end of the century along with a Plan of Action (POA), which assigned specific responsibilities for organizing, implementing and financing proposals. From 1968 onwards, the goal has been to set apart six percent of the National Income on education. In spite of resource constraints as well as competing priorities, the expenditure on education as a percentage of Gross National Product (GNP) has steadily increased from 0. 8 percent in 1951 - 52 to 3. 3 percent in 1994 - 95. Paragraph 11. 4 of the 1986 NPE states that: “ … the <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education</b> is gradually increased to reach a level of six percent of the National Income as early as possible. Since the actual level of investment has remained far short of that target, it is important that greater determination is shown now to find the funds for the programs laid down in this policy. While actual requirements will be computed from time to time on the basis of monitoring and review, the outlay on education will be stepped up to ensure that during the 8 th Five year Plan and onwards it will uniformly exceed six percent of the national income. ” There are 130 schemes in the Department with a total Eighth Plan outlay of Rs 74, 430 million. The outlay for 1996 - 97 was Rs 33, 827 million. There are 18 Centrally Sponsored Schemes which account for 65. 7 percent of the total outlay.

MÉTODOS: Estudo transversal com amostra randomizada da população adulta da cidade de Campo Grande, MS, num total de 892 pessoas. Foi aplicado questionário sobre idade, sexo, escolaridade, tabagismo, etilismo, aspectos sobre o tratamento. Foram colhidos dados antropométricos (peso e altura). Segundo a OMS, foi considerado peso normal: IMC IMC 30. Os critérios para hipertensão foram baseados no VII Joint, com valores de corte de Pressão Arterial de 140 x 90 mmHg. RESULTADOS: A prevalência de hipertensão foi de 41, 4 %, variando conforme idade (até 29 anos: 11, 8 %; 30 - 39 : 24, 8 %; 40 - 49 : 43, 3 %; 50 - 59 : 42, 4 %; 60 - 69 : 48, 6 % e > 70 : 62, 3 %). Houve maior prevalência nos homens (51, 8 %), enquanto nas mulheres foi de 33, 1 %. As pessoas com formação escolar de 1 º grau primário tendem a apresentar maiores índices pressóricos. Nos indivíduos com sobrepeso e obesidade, observou-se maior prevalência de pressão elevada: IMC normal (27, 9 %), sobrepeso (45, 6 %) e obesidade (58, 6 %). A partir dos 60 anos existe um maior porcentual de hipertensão sistólica isolada, representado por 16, 4 % (60 - 69 anos) e de 24, 6 % (> 70 anos). Etilismo diário ou semanal também está relacionado a maior incidência, respectivamente, de 63, 2 % e 47, 2 %. Apenas 59, 7 % eram sabidamente hipertensos.

OBJECTIVES: To {{detect the}} actual prevalence of systemic hypertension {{in the city}} of Campo Grande, MS, Brazil, and frequent factors. METHODS: Cross-sectional study with a randomized sample of the adult population of the city of Campo Grande, MS, in a total of 892 individuals. A questionnaire on age, gender, level of education, smoking, alcohol consumption, and aspects of the treatment was applied. Anthropometric data (weight and height) were collected. According to the WHO, a BMI BMI 30 obesity. Criteria for hypertension were based on the JNC VII report, with blood pressure cut-off values of 140 x 90 mmHg. RESULTS: The prevalence of hypertension was 41. 4 %, varying with age (up to 29 years: 11. 8 %; 30 - 39 : 24. 8 %; 40 - 49 : 43. 3 %; 50 - 59 : 42. 4 %; 60 - 69 : 48. 6 % and > 70 : 62. 3 %). A higher prevalence was observed among men (51. 8 %), whereas among women the prevalence was 33. 1 %. Individuals with basic level of education tended to present higher rates. Among overweight and obese individuals, a higher prevalence of hypertension was observed: normal BMI (27. 9 %), overweight (45. 6 %) and obesity (58. 6 %). Above 60 years of age, a higher percentage of isolated systolic hypertension was observed, with 16. 4 % (60 - 69 years) and 24. 6 % (> 70 years). Daily or weekly alcohol consumption was also related to a higher incidence, of 63. 2 % and 47. 2 %, respectively. Only 59. 7 % were known to be hypertensive. Of the hypertensive individuals, 57. 3 % were undergoing some type of treatment. Of those undergoing regular treatment, 60. 5 % presented hypertension. CONCLUSION: The prevalence of hypertension was 41. 4 %, therefore higher than the average verified in some studies.

40|$|A epidemia do HIV/AIDS vem mobilizando nas últimas três décadas muitos pesquisadores de diversas áreas do conhecimento (medicina, psicologia, educação, sociologia, antropologia, dentre outras), visto ser um problema sério de saúde pública e a prevenção, a {{principal}} arma que a ciência lança mão para o seu combate. Nesse sentido, muita se produziu nos últimos anos visando contribuir para o aprimoramento das propostas de intervenção na área da saúde e educação, com o intuito de combater e prevenir a disseminação das doenças sexualmente transmissíveis em geral, e em especial, a AIDS, sobretudo junto à juventude. Vale observar que dentre as propostas de intervenção, algumas privilegiaram uma concepção biomédica de saúde, centrando suas preocupações na fisiologia do corpo humano e na prescrição e transmissão de conhecimentos e formas de comportamentos, cujos argumentos enfatizavam a utilização pura e simples do preservativo masculino, sem grande preocupação em trazer para o debate questões de ordem social e cultural que determinam e conduzem o desejo e as práticas afetivas e sexuais dos indivíduos. O presente trabalho tem por objetivo refletir, por meio de uma leitura psicossocial, a respeito das estratégias de intervenção que aponta o jovem como o promotor de ações de prevenção às DST/AIDS junto a seus pares da mesma faixa etária. Entender a subjetividade dessas jovens lideranças das camadas populares na sociedade contemporânea, frente a seu papel como agente de prevenção no combate às DST/AIDS e de como se percebem no exercício de sua própria sexualidade, foi uma de nossas preocupações centrais. Outra questão envolveu o questionamento sobre até que ponto o investimento na formação, preparação e instrumentalização desses jovens em relação a questões ligadas à sexualidade favorecem suas tomadas de decisões com maior segurança em suas relações afetivas e sexuais. As contribuições teóricas de Pichon-Rivière foram fundamentais para trazer aos grupos de discussão as representações individuais e coletivas acerca de temas que os agentes discutem e problematizam nas oficinas de sexualidade junto a outros jovens, possibilitando um processo de ressignificação das representações que fazem acerca de concepções fortemente enraizadas em nossa cultura envolvendo, desde as desigualdades de gênero, o amor romântico até os preconceitos e tabus em torno da sexualidade e de como têm essas concepções interiorizadas, a despeito de toda a crítica que tecem sobre as mesmas. The HIV/AIDS epidemic has been mobilizing several researchers from several areas of knowledge (medicine, psychology, education, sociology, anthropology, among others), {{during the last}} three decades, as this is a serious public health problem and prevention the leading weapon that science can take hold of to struggle against it. In this aspect, a great deal of work has been produced in the last years aiming to contribute to the betterment of the proposals to intervene in the health and education areas, with the purpose of fighting and preventing dissemination of sexually transmitted diseases as a whole and AIDS specially, above all to the young. That is worth observing that among the intervening proposals, some have privileged a biomedical health conception, focusing the concerns on human body physiology and on the prescription and transmission of knowledge and types of behavior, which arguments have emphasized only the use of male condoms without a great concern to bring into the debate issues of social and cultural aspects that determine and conduct the desire and the affective and sexual practices of individuals. The present work has the purpose of pondering, by means of a psychosocial reading, over the intervention strategies that point out the young as the promoter of the prevention action for STD/AIDS next to his/her peers of the same age group. To understand the subjectivity of such young leadership in the popular groups of our contemporary society, in face of his/her role as an agent of prevention in the battle against STD/AIDS and how they perceive themselves in the practice of their own sexuality, was one of our central concerns. Another issue brought into question was in which extent the <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> <b>education,</b> preparation, and instrumentalization of this young group, in relation to the issues connected to sexuality, assist them to safely reach decisions in their affective and sexual relationships. The theoretical contributions of Pichon-Rivière were fundamental to bring into the discussion groups the individual and collective representations for the issues that the agents discuss and problematize in the study groups about sexuality next to other young people, making possible a re-signification of the representations they do about extremely rooted conceptions of our culture covering from gender disparities, the romantic love, to the prejudices and taboos around sexuality - and how these conceptions are internalized despite of all criticism they comment on them...|$|E

The {{purpose of this paper is}} to calculate the rates of returns and prices for the faculties of medicine in Turkey. The data for both social and private benefits and costs was obtained using the cost-benefit analysis method. By means of the data obtained, both private and social return rates were calculated using the internal return rate technique. The price of higher education was obtained through the private return rate and current interest rate. In the conclusion section, it was pointed out that the private return rates at higher education level are significantly higher than the social return rates causing decreased price and increased individual demand...|$|R

This study is {{noteworthy}} because it advocates for public spending on early childhood programs as an economic investment in a society's future, {{rather than in the}} interest of social justice.|$|R

This paper examines one potential {{explanation for this}} persistence, namely colonial public <b>investments</b> <b>on</b> primary <b>education.</b> Although OLS estimates suggest a strong and persistence effect of colonial spending on educational outcomes across 147 districts of former British India, IV estimates find colonial spending {{to be a significant}} determinant of outcomes only until the 1970 s. The effects of historical spending are relatively short lived in the Indian context because of an effective government campaign beginning in the 1970 s to reduce inequalities in the provision of public service...|$|R

Using qualitative, historical, and quantitative methods and {{based on data from}} UNESCO and African Development Bank, it analyzes the impact of economic factors, specifically gross domestic <b>investment,</b> public expenditure <b>on</b> <b>education</b> as a percentage of gross national product, public expenditure <b>on</b> <b>education</b> as a percentage of government expenditure, and government deficit/surplus as a percentage of GDP at current prices, on women’s access to higher education...|$|R
40|$|This {{article focuses}} on the recent changes {{occurred}} {{in the beginning of}} the 21 st century regarding elementary school: the inclusion of six-year-old children in the segment and, consequently, the extension of basic education in Brazil to nine years. Such adjustments had an impact on school organization. One of them is evident by the adoption of the cyclic educational curriculum. Another change is the <b>investment</b> <b>on</b> continuous <b>education</b> for public school teachers. A research accomplished with literacy teachers in Campinas, in Sao Paulo state, brings to the debate their opinion on the working practices. Through their narratives we are able to understand their work in face of the organization of a cyclic educational program and their proposals regarding writing and reading in the context of literacy studies...|$|R

The win-win-win situation of the government, parks and visitors can be obtained when the positive interaction mechanism of government leading, tourism enterprise implementing and tourist participating is established.

Subnational fiscal autonomy is approximated by the revenue share of autonomous taxes. A fixed effects panel estimation reveals that SNG tax autonomy significantly contributes to regional convergence although its impact is small when compared to the effect of transport infrastructure <b>investment.</b> Subnational expenditure <b>on</b> <b>education</b> and economic affairs does not impact spatial disparities. status: publishe...|$|R
