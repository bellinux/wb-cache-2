50|$|Privately John Daker {{harbours}} doubts, but {{decides that}} his allegiance {{must be to}} his own kind even if <b>the</b> <b>Eldren</b> are not as demonic as Rigenos claims. During this time and throughout the book, the narrator continues to have dreams in which he takes on the identity of many heroes engaged in constant, unending struggle. After secretly betrothing himself to Iolinda, he leads an expedition against <b>the</b> <b>Eldren</b> seaport Paphanaal. <b>The</b> human fleet destroys an Eldren fleet in a naval battle, then takes Paphanaal easily as the only remaining inhabitants are women and children. Erekosë is sickened {{by the actions of}} his human allies <b>during</b> <b>the</b> battle and the sack of the city. <b>The</b> only surviving <b>Eldren</b> is Ermizhad, sister of Prince Arjavh <b>the</b> <b>Eldren</b> commander; she is put in Erekosë's keeping <b>during</b> <b>the</b> return to Necranal.|$|R
40|$|The {{present study}} {{represents}} {{an attempt to}} nd an electrophysiological correlate of the redundant targets effect, or RTE (i. e., the speeding up of reaction time, or RT, for redundant vs. single targets). Subjects made a speeded response either to one small checkerboard presented {{to the left or}} right of xation or to a pair of identical checkerboards presented simultaneously to both hemi elds. Both single and double targets could appear either in the upper or lower visual hemi <b>eld.</b> <b>The</b> <b>task</b> required detection but not discrimination of the stimuli. During task performance, we recorded the event-related potentials (ERPs) elicited by the checkerboard targets. As in previous studies, we found that manual RTs to bilateral stimuli were faster than those to unilateral stimuli. This effect was more marked for lower- than for upper- eld stimuli and could not be ascribed to probability summation. In addition, we found that the P 1 and N 1 components of the visual ERP had a shorter latency for bilateral than for summed unilateral stimuli presented to <b>the</b> two hemi <b>elds.</b> In parallel with the behavioral ndings, the latency values for the above components showed a larger RTE for lower- eld stimuli. These ndings indicate that the RTE occurs at the level of early visual processing, probably in the extrastriate visual cortex, rather than at late decisional or premotor stag...|$|R
40|$|Time series {{measurements}} of radiative fluxes were made onboard INS Sagardhwani (SD) {{in the south}} Bay of Bengal near DS 3 (13 N and 87 E) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> BOBMEX <b>eld</b> experiment. An inter-comparison experiment conducted at DS 3 showed that the radiative fluxes measured by Kipp and Zonen, Albedo meter and net Pyrgeometer onboard SD and by Eppley radiometers onboard ORV Sagar Kanya (SK) are well matched. It may be mentioned that the measurements showed consistency and good agreement between SD and SK ships, even though no Gimbal mounting was used for radiation instruments onboard SD. The main aim of the experiment was collection of high quality radiation data <b>during</b> <b>the</b> monsoon period, which can give an insight {{into the nature of}} the ocean-atmosphere coupling. The data on the four radiative fluxes collected on SD are averaged at 5 minute intervals and then hourly and daily averages have been computed. The hourly shortwave albedo and the atmospheric transmission factor are also computed and the variation of albedo in relation to the solar altitude and the transmissivity factor (TF) are studied. The mean albedo over the south Bay of Bengal under clear, partly cloudy and overcast skies are found to be 0. 05, 0. 07 and 0. 2 respectively. 1...|$|R
40|$|Organic farmers {{look to the}} {{possibilities}} of growing neglected crops, such as the spring forms of hulled wheat – einkorn, emmer and spelt – for support in developing the organic farming system. In 2008, 169 landraces from the gene bank at the Crop Research Institute in Prague were tested on certifi ed organic plots. The experiment was aimed at fi nding suitable varieties for the organic farming system. In summary, our fi ndings show that einkorn (Triticum monococcum L.) and emmer wheat [Triticum dicoccum Schrank (Schuebl) ] are resistant to powdery mildew and brown rust, spelt wheat (Triticum spelta L.) is less resistant to these two diseases, and the intermediate forms of bread wheat {{are very sensitive to}} such infestation. The varieties evaluated incline to lodging, as they have long and weak stems. Einkorn and emmer wheat have short and dense spikes and a low thousand grains weight, whereas spelt wheat has long and lax spikes. The level of the harvest index is low. Potentially useful varieties were found <b>during</b> <b>the</b> fi <b>eld</b> experiment and evaluation, and our future efforts will therefore focus on improving resistance to lodging and increasing the productivity of the spike...|$|R
40|$|Qarat al-Kibrit 1 (QK 1) is the rst strati ed aceramic Neolithic {{archaeological site}} {{excavated}} {{in the interior}} of Oman. The site is situated along the outer rim of the Qarat al-Kibrit salt dome, an endorheic diapir on the ad-Dakhliyah alluvial plain. QK 1 was excavated by the Central Oman Pleistocene Research program <b>during</b> <b>the</b> 2004 <b>eld</b> season, yielding three distinct archaeological horizons within approximately one meter of in situ Early and Middle Holocene sediments. A single radiometric date was established by AMS measurement on a perforated Conus shell recovered from archaeological level 1, while a rough temporal span is estimated for levels 2 and 3 based on the identi cation of lithic arrowheads belonging to the Neolithic Arabian Bifacial Tradition. Techno-typological analysis of the chipped stone assemblage recovered from the site has documented a variety of lithic reduction strategies employed by the inhabitants of QK 1. Given the presence of high quality halite (salt crystal) deposits within the dome that exhibit clear evidence of quarrying activity, we speculate that Neolithic and Bronze Age human groups were drawn to the area in order to exploit this valuable resource as well as the freshwater runoff draining into the endorheic basin...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. We derive {{formulae}} for all parameters dening <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> astigmatism of misaligned two mirror telescopes with arbitrary geometries {{and with}} stop positions any-where {{on the line}} connecting the vertices of the two mir-rors. The formulae show explicitly the dependence of <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> astigmatism on <b>the</b> fundamental design parameters and characteristics of the telescope and on the stop posi-tion. Special attention {{is given to the}} particular case where such a schiefspiegler has been corrected for coma at <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> center. In addition, we study the eects of the prac-tical denition that the center of <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> is <b>the</b> center of the adapter. Following a recent paper by McLeod, where <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> dependence of astigmatism is used to collimate a Ritchey-Chretien telescope with the stop at the primary mirror, we apply our formulae to the Cassegrain focus of the ESO Very Large Telescope (VLT), where the stop is at the secondary mirror and the telescope is only corrected for spherical aberration. We present measurements of <b>the</b> <b>eld</b> astigmatism and discuss the accuracy of the collima-tion method. Key words: telescopes 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Magnetic <b>eld</b> {{measurements}} from <b>the</b> POLAR satellite {{are presented}} for three dusk to dawn apogee passes <b>during</b> <b>the</b> January 1997 magnetic cloud event. The variability in <b>the</b> residual <b>elds</b> from one orbit {{to the next}} are investigated {{in terms of the}} changing solar wind and magnetospheric current systems. <b>The</b> observed <b>elds</b> are compared to the Tsyganenko 96 (T 96 01) model which allows dynamic solar wind and Dst inputs. <b>The</b> model <b>elds</b> are found to generally agree with <b>the</b> observed <b>elds</b> with <b>the</b> greatest discrepancy occurring during periods of large dynamic pressure. An investigation of the contributions to the T 96 01 model by the various solar wind and Dst inputs provides insight into the solar wind control of the high al-titude magnetosphere above the polar cap. It is found that the ring current is responsible for the largest proportion of <b>the</b> observed magnetic <b>eld</b> residuals while <b>the</b> interplane-tary magnetic <b>eld</b> and solar wind dynamic pressure control a smaller proportion primarily producing the shorter time scale variations in <b>the</b> observed <b>elds...</b>|$|R
