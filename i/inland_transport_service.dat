40|$|The {{performance}} of the transport chain {{is important for the}} efficiency and competitiveness of an economy. In the context of port competition, there has been an increasing cooperation between firms involved in the intermodal transport chain including seaport services. This paper examines the economic incentives and welfare implications to the integration of port activities with <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> under inter-ports competition. Although ports find it advantageous to engage in such integration process it may be detrimental to welfare, since shippers' aggregate surplus decreases - noting that farther away users benefit at the expense of those closer to the ports. Several scenarios not leading to such welfare decrease are identified: asymmetries in port capacities, government regulation and efficiency gains. These latter results provide support to policies that favor integration processes of <b>transport</b> <b>service...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{existing}} liner container-shipping networks worldwide {{serving the}} intercontinental supply chains have {{shown to be}} very diverse regarding the types of offered <b>transport</b> <b>services,</b> the network spatial/operational complexity {{in terms of the}} strength of presence on the global and secondary lines/routes, and the types of bundling of TEU flows. Regarding the strength of presence on the global and secondary lines/routes, they have been roughly categorized into H&S (Hub-and-Spoke), ETE (End-To-End), RTW (Round-The-World), pendulum, and triangle (Tran and Haasis 2015). Regarding the type of bundling of TEU flows, they have been categorized as: i) Bundling with and individual liner service; and ii) Bundling by combining/linking two or more liner services (Ducruet and Notteboom 2012). In the former case, the network carriers collect the TEU flows by calling different ports along the given trunk line/route constrained by the origin and destination seaports, i.e., they operate the MPC (Multi-Port-Call) network configurations. In the latter case, the TEU flows are collected at the seaports usually located at the intersections of the main maritime trade routes and additionally consolidated by the feeder short-sea and <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> The same or different carriers and/or their alliances as that operating the trunk line/main route between the hubs can carry out the short-sea shipping feeder services. The road and rail transport mode and their systems usually provide the <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services.</b> Consequently, these seaports operate as hubs of the H&S networks of the liner container-shipping carriers and/or their alliances (Panayides and Wiedmer 2011). In these networks, the trunk lines/routes usually connect a pair of hubs by the shipping services carried out with much less or no intermediate port calls compared to the MPC counterparts. Due to concentration of the TEU flows at hubs the ships are sufficiently full thus not needing to exchange their cargo at the intermediate ports (Ducruet and Notteboom 2012).|$|R
40|$|Before the {{introduction}} of terminal handling charges (THCs), traditional freight rates included both ocean freight charges and terminal charges at ports. Since {{the introduction}} of THCs in 199 1, the freight rate has become a "port-to-port" charge that covers only the sea leg, while the on-shore costs of using the container terminals are charged separately as THCs. Although both THCs and freight rates are collectively set by conferences, {{in this study we}} argue that the former are easier to enforce because they are invariant to other attributes such as haulage distance, <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> and types of commodity being shipped. This argument is consistent with the empirical findings from this study that suggest the separation of ocean freight rates from terminal charges has increased the overall shipping charges. In addition, we find that THCs affect the Hong Kong container handling industry by lowering its throughput. (C) 2003 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The influence of the economies of scale in <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport</b> and terminal operations {{are taken into account}} in the analysis. In the model the transport costs are defined and related to different transport operations and conditions (e. g. share of empty kilometres, capacity usage of terminals, etc.) in order to analyse the sensitivity of the cost performance of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport.</b> By doing this it is possible to analyse to what extent intermodal freight transport is competitive with road-only transport in terms of transport costs and specific operations and conditions (both in shipping and terminal). The conclusions prove that roundtrips, drop & pick operations in pre- and end-haulage and smaller containers (20 ft instead of 40 ft) considerably improve the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport,</b> while the relative high cost operations in small terminals reduce the competitiveness of intermodal <b>inland</b> waterway <b>transport...</b>|$|R

30|$|Inter-port {{competition}} increasingly {{focuses on}} the hinterland legs of door-to-door transport chains through the integration of maritime and <b>inland</b> <b>transport</b> systems [1, 2]. Vermeiren [3], studying competition between the ports of Rotterdam and Antwerp, even claims that intermodal transport chains are the single key differentiators in these door-to-door transport chains. Nevertheless, most ports (have to) rely {{to a large extent}} on road transport for serving their hinterland, although intermodal transport connections can maintain and extend the hinterland of seaports [4]. In this research, intermodal transport is defined as the use of different transport modes in a single transport chain, using loading units such as standardized containers, with no handling of the goods when changing modes (based on [5]) and the focus is solely on hinterland chains. An extensive intermodal transport network gives logistics service providers the opportunity to offer shippers a wide range of transport possibilities [6]. Furthermore, these alternative transport modes can alleviate congestion problems in and around the port area. Different barriers however prevent a more extensive use of intermodal <b>transport</b> <b>services</b> (see e.g. [7 – 9]).|$|R
