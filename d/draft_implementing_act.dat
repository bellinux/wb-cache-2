40|$|The {{comitology}} {{procedures have}} been {{an integral part of}} the European Union legislative decision-making process. The negotiation of the legal framework of the comitology procedures, as well as the administrative practice of the European Commission in <b>drafting</b> <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> is relevant to the legal research on the evolution of European integration. This article studies the dynamic relationship between the process of regulation and implementation of comitology procedures, and the process of parliamentarisation of the European Communities and later of the European Union. Two hypotheses are tested. The first hypothesis claims that there is a clear causal link between the use of newly acquired budgetary and legislative powers of the European Parliament, and the limitation of control by Member States on the Commission by the comitology committees. The second hypothesis claims that a weak system interaction exists between the notion of parliamentarisation and the reform of the comitology system...|$|R

40|$|The {{relative}} {{power of}} the Commission, the Parliament and the Council in the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> including {{the debate on the}} delimitation of the scope of these acts, has dominated the debate on the scheme of non-legislative acts introduced by the Lisbon Treaty. This chapter argues that approaching decision-making procedures of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> only from an institutional lens is normatively insufficient, in two respects. First, it is incongruous with the Treaty provisions on democracy: not only an inter-institutional perspective is insufficient to ensure the democratic legitimacy of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> but also it ignores the relationships between the makers of legal acts and the outer sphere composed of citizens and legally affected persons. Secondly, it also overlooks core functions of procedures that are relevant to ensure the legitimacy of public acts. Procedures are a means to rationalise public action, by channeling information, weighing competing interests, and allowing scrutiny of the choices made. If designed accordingly, procedures could concretise democracy as a Union founding principle also in the making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{reform of}} non-legislative acts {{introduced}} by Articles 290 and 291 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union {{was guided by}} concerns regarding the democratic legitimacy of (lato sensu) <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> of the Union. However, it has ignored the centrality of transparency in the Union's democracy {{and the role of}} participation as a complementary source of democracy. This article argues that the procedures leading to the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> are subject to the treaties' provisions on transparency and participation, and should be shaped by them. It analyses the constitutional choices underlying Articles 290 and 291, with a view to assessing whether and to what extent the material, organic and functional profiles of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> condition procedural rules on transparency and participation to be followed in their adoption...|$|R

40|$|The {{procedures}} {{guiding the}} making of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> have been conceived from a predominantly inter-institutional perspective and have not taken account of the participative democracy dimension. The system for delegation of powers set out in Articles 290 and 291 TFEU does not envisage, let alone structure, the relationships between decision-makers and the ‘outer’ sphere: those legally affected by the legal acts of the Union and the public. This dimension should not be ignored in the current constitutional framework, given that Articles 9, 10 (3), and 11 TEU establish normative parameters that should shape {{the relationships between the}} institutions and citizens, and in {{the making of}} delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> Therefore, since Articles 290 and 291 TFEU do not exhaust the constitutional framing of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> the EU legislature should provide a remedy by adopting procedural rules aimed at securing participation and transparency within the process...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this article}} is to explore the {{conceptual}} bases and methodological issues involved in the codification process of Estonia׳s intellectual property law and outline the main results. The conceptual bases of this codification consist of evolutionary development, a comparative-law approach, stakeholder involvement and regulatory impact assessment. The reform draws on the existing regulatory framework (existing IP law), developed further by the identification and use of the best regulatory practices of other countries and model laws. Stakeholder involvement and regulatory impact assessment are used to improve the draft law and make it compatible with Estonian socio-economic conditions. This article summarises the results of the extensive work from 2012 to 2014 that resulted in the draft Copyright and Related Rights Act, the draft Industrial Property Code and the <b>draft</b> <b>Act</b> <b>Implementing</b> the Copyright and Related Rights Act and the Industrial Property Code with the relevant annexes. The analysis focuses on the Estonian codification project as a case study. The author relies on traditional research methods from social science and draws on comparative and dogmatic analysis conducted during the codification, using empirical socio-economic data acquired through stakeholder involvement and impact assessment. The article also reflects the author׳s personal experience, insights and intimate knowledge of the codification process gained through management and coordination of the project and in acting as a head of the expert group on the codification of IP law under the auspices of the Ministry of Justice of Estonia. The Estonian example could serve as a comparative model for countries aiming to modernise their IP laws within the EU acquis and international legal framework...|$|R

40|$|The non-representative {{character}} of the Commission’s powers {{has been used to}} level criticism at Commission acts. I review the Commission’s power to adopt {{some of the most important}} and numerous EU acts, namely delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts.</b> These acts often take direct effect on the persons within the Member States. The question I ask is how the Commission’s power to adopt acts that legally bind the persons within the Member States can be justified normatively? I explain the most pervasive characteristics of the adoption of delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts,</b> as well as their conceptual categorisation. I argue that delegated and implementing rule-making should be understood in the framework of institutional trust. The relation of institutional trust can in legal terms best be depicted under the framework of fiduciary law. The Commission here takes the role of fiduciary to the persons subject to delegated and <b>implementing</b> <b>acts</b> as beneficiaries. As a result, the Commission is under a duty of loyalty towards these persons. I argue that for this, the EU duty of loyalty should be expanded to include a Commission duty of disinterestedness and fairness. These should be operationalised through giving an account of its motives, and through greater transparency regarding the participation of interested groups in the adoption procedure. These procedures are only a small extension of already existing Commission obligations. However, reforming them as an expression of loyalty is able to re-invent the relation between the Commission and the persons subject to its acts...|$|R
