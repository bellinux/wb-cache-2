As Raghuveer and Indu leave in a helicopter, Harsha tries {{to catch them}} but fails; falling into a lake, <b>he</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> near-death {{experience}} and learns about his past life in 1609. In that year, Emperor Sher Khan is preparing to invade the kingdom of Udayghar when he hears of the brave warrior Kala Bhairava (Harsha), commander of the Udayghad army. King Vikram Singh's daughter, Mithravindha Devi (Indu), loves Bhairava, but he holds himself back. Her cousin, Ranadev Billa (Raghuveer), lusts after Mithra and plans a competition between himself and Bhairava; the winner will marry her and the loser will be banished from Udayghad. Bhairava's victory leads to Ranadev's banishment. Vikram Singh, however, secretly requests that Bhairava not marry his daughter, because Bhairava has a high chance of dying in battle, {{and he does not}} wish to see Mithra widowed. Though shocked, Bhirava concedes to the king's request and publicly declines to marry Mithra, leaving her distraught.|$|E

25|$|Lane Pryce (Jared Harris); {{recurring}} Season 3, regular Seasons 4–5: The English {{financial officer}} installed by Sterling Cooper's new British parent company. He first {{appears in the}} first episode of Season 3. His role {{is that of a}} strict taskmaster who brings spending under control, in particular by cutting out frivolous expenses. His efforts are so successful, he is to be sent to India to enact cost-cutting measures, a move which Pryce is not looking forward to after having settled in with his wife and child in New York. An unfortunate accident at work handicaps his replacement, thus allowing Pryce to keep his current position. He warms to American culture, and foresees some form of cultural and societal changes in American race relations. When the British parent company is sold at the end of Season 3, Pryce realizes he has become expendable and negotiates to become a founding partner in the new agency that Don Draper, Bert Cooper and Roger Sterling want to form. At Draper's suggestion, Pryce frees Sterling, Cooper, and Draper from their contractual non-compete clauses by firing them, then is fired himself, enabling the four of them to start their own firm. When hard times hit SCDP after Lucky Strike, their largest client, leaves them in Season 4, Pryce liquidates his portfolio in order to pay his share of the cash infusion required by the bank as collateral for a loan that keeps SCDP afloat. His finances already tight, <b>he</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> crisis when the British Inland Revenue demand immediate payment of back taxes on the gain from the sale of his portfolio in Season 5. In order to pay the debt, Pryce secretly negotiates a $50,000 line of credit on behalf of the firm and announces to the partners that SCDP has a $50,000 profit and is able to pay bonuses. In anticipation of the bonus, Pryce forges Draper's signature on an early bonus check to himself, and views it as a 13-day loan which will be made good once the bonuses are paid. However, the partners decide to forgo their bonuses despite Pryce's pleading. In the penultimate episode of Season 5, Cooper discovers the cancelled check and confronts Draper, who in turn confronts Pryce, demanding his resignation. That weekend, Pryce types out a resignation letter and hangs himself in his office.|$|E

500|$|The {{theme of}} racial {{injustice}} appears symbolically {{in the novel}} as well. For example, Atticus must shoot a rabid dog, {{even though it is}} not his job to do so. Carolyn Jones argues that the dog represents prejudice within the town of Maycomb, and Atticus, who waits on a deserted street to shoot the dog, must fight against the town's racism without help from other white citizens. He is also alone when <b>he</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> group intending to lynch Tom Robinson and once more in the courthouse during Tom's trial. Lee even uses dreamlike imagery from the mad dog incident to describe some of the courtroom scenes. Jones writes, [...] "he real mad dog in Maycomb is the racism that denies the humanity of Tom Robinson.... When Atticus makes his summation to the jury, he literally bares himself to the jury's and the town's anger." ...|$|E
500|$|The year 1936 marked an {{important}} {{turning point in}} Cooper's career. After making Frank Borzage's romantic comedy film Desire with Marlene Dietrich at Paramount—delivering a performance considered by some contemporary critics {{as one of his}} finest—Cooper returned to Poverty Row {{for the first time since}} his early silent film days to make Frank Capra's screwball comedy Mr. Deeds Goes to Town with Jean Arthur for Columbia Pictures. In the film, Cooper plays the character of Longfellow Deeds, a quiet, innocent writer of greeting cards who inherits a fortune, leaves behind his idyllic life in Vermont, and travels to New York where <b>he</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> world of corruption and deceit. Capra and screenwriter Robert Riskin were able to use Cooper's well-established screen persona as the [...] "quintessential American hero"—a symbol of honesty, courage, and goodness—to create a new type of [...] "folk hero" [...] for the common man.

2500|$|The first {{criminal}} case {{resulting from the}} standoff, against six Bundy supporters, was declared a mistrial by U.S. District Judge Gloria Navarro on April 24, 2017. Six men {{had been charged with}} conspiring with Cliven Bundy to prevent a court-ordered cattle seizure. The mistrial was declared hours after the jury convicted two men of some of the 10 counts in the indictment. The jurors reported to the court they were “hopelessly deadlocked” on the remaining counts and defendants, despite the judge having sent them back to deliberate further but they were unable to reach any unanimous verdicts for four defendants, described by prosecutors as the [...] "least culpable" [...] of the 17 who were charged, and on the remaining counts for the two who were convicted. Over 50 prosecution witnesses testified in the two-month trial. Former militia group member, Gregory Burleson, of Arizona, who has also been a paid FBI informant, was convicted of assault upon and threatening of a federal officer, aiding extortion via both interstate commerce and travel, obstruction of justice, plus multiple gun counts. <b>He</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> 57-year mandatory minimum sentence.

At his July 26 sentencing, Burleson was given 68 years for recruiting others in Arizona to join the standoff, and posting [...] "alcohol fueled' rants encouraging others to do the same. Engel was to be sentenced on the following day with Cliven, Ammon and Ryan Bundy and two others expected to be tried later in 2017.

But this is alone some and dreary spot. The tall edifices bid gloomy defiance to the storm, with their blinds all closed, even as a man winks when <b>he</b> <b>faces</b> <b>a</b> spattering gust. How loudly tinkles the collected rain down the tin spouts! The puffs of wind are boisterous, and seem to assail me from various quarters at once. I have often observed that this corner is a haunt and loitering-place for those winds which have no work to do upon the deep, dashing ships against our iron-bound shores; nor in the forest, tearing up the sylvan giants with half a rood of soil at their vast roots. Here they amuse themselves with lesser freaks of mischief. See, at this moment, how they assail yonder poor woman, who is passing just within the verge of the lamplight! One blast struggles for her umbrella, and turns it wrong side outward; another whisks the cape of her cloak across her eyes; while a third takes most unwarrantable liberties with the lower part of her attire. Happily, the good dame is no gossamer, but a figure of rotundity and fleshly substance; else would these aerial tormentors whirl her aloft, like a witch upon a broomstick, and set her down, doubtless, in the filthiest kennel hereabout.|$|E
