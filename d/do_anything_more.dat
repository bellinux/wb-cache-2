25|$|The {{prisoners are}} {{assigned}} numbers for easy identification {{and in an}} effort to dehumanize them; Ivan Denisovich's prisoner number is Щ-854. Each day, the squad leader receives their work assignment for that day, and the squad are then fed according to how they perform. Prisoners in each squad are thus forced to work together and pressure each other to get their task done. If any prisoner is slacking, the whole squad will be punished. Despite this, Solzhenitsyn shows that a surprising loyalty exists among the work gang members, with Shukhov teaming up with other prisoners to steal felt and extra bowls of porridge; even the squad leader defies the authorities by tar-papering over the empty windows at their work site. Indeed, only through such solidarity can the prisoners <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than survive from day to day.|$|E
25|$|Reverses {{in the air}} and on {{the ground}} soon followed. Japanese forces had naval superiority, and they used it to make {{outflanking}} amphibious landings as they advanced down the Malayan peninsula towards Singapore. Japanese assaults from the ground and air soon made the forward landing grounds that much of the RAF's only real hope of defending Singapore from the air rested upon untenable. The RAF took a toll of Japanese forces, but there were never enough aircraft to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than delay the Japanese offensive. Indian, British, and Australian army forces in Malaya were larger in numbers than the other services. But they were equally ill-prepared and ill-led. They were committed in numbers both too small and too poorly positioned to counter the Japanese tactic of outflanking strongpoints through the jungle. Over a period of several weeks, the Allied ground forces steadily gave ground.|$|E
25|$|In {{the eighth}} season of TV series Supernatural, protagonists Dean and Sam Winchester {{discover}} that Metatron (Curtis Armstrong) {{has been living}} in isolation for centuries because he became disgusted with Heaven's actions. Although he initially presents himself as an ally in the brothers' quests to seal up Heaven and Hell after they find him again, Metatron later turns against them, tricking their angelic ally Castiel into completing a ritual that leaves Castiel stripped of his angelic powers and banishes all angels apart from Metatron to Earth. Throughout the ninth season, the brothers and Castiel are forced to deal with the return of the arch-demon Abaddon along with the angels that were banished by Metatron's actions, with Metatron gathering allies that he will 'allow' back into Heaven while presenting Castiel as the villain, until Castiel manages to regain his powers and trick Metatron into revealing the monster he truly is to the other angels. Although he is released from prison in Heaven when the brothers and Castiel question him for information about the new threat in the tenth season, he is subsequently stripped of his powers by Castiel and left to wander Earth, powerless to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than watch as the world goes by while aware that the other angels will kill him if he does anything to draw their attention. After God returns to help the Winchesters against new foe the Darkness- essentially God's sister, who he sacrificed to make the world- Metatron sacrifices himself to give the Winchesters time to escape after they rescue Lucifer- currently using Castiel as a vessel- from the Darkness.|$|E

During this timeframe, he made sporadic public appearances, attending boxing cards and participating in public activities, including a ceremony where Juan Manuel López and Iván Calderón received rings for five successful defenses of their world championships. Beginning in July 2009, Trinidad became involved with the World Wrestling Council, participating as a guest referee at their anniversary show. Three months later, he was included in a storyline that also included Orlando Colón. In 2010, Trinidad expressed interest in purchasing the Changos de Naranjito.|$|E
500|$|... "Weeping Willow" [...] {{analyzes}} {{the concept of}} 15 minutes of fame during the Information Age {{from the perspective of}} the Internet celebrity, one who gains fame through the creation of or participation in a popular website. Leight said of the episode, [...] "Forget about 15 minutes of fame: there are hundreds of people who get their 15 inches of bandwidth, people making names for themselves on YouTube and others. ... This blogging phenomenon has created a certain kind of 'cyberfame,' people who don't have to <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> than put themselves on the Web and catch a cyberwave. We now have a spate of very strange celebrities." [...] Leight said the episode also focuses on the extent to which one will go to achieve such fame. While the Law & Order shows routinely draw on inspiration from real-life events in an approach the creators call [...] "ripped from the headlines", Criminal Intent producers referred to this episode as [...] "'pre-ripping' from the headlines", because the script usually took a real-life event (as the lonelygirl15 phenomenon) and added to it a fictional dramatic conflict (the kidnapping).|$|E

2500|$|Now {{continuing}} their {{career as a}} trio, with Ihsahn handling keyboards, vocals, guitars and bass, the band recorded their third album IX Equilibrium and toured Europe and North America. It was around 2000 when Samoth and Trym started to gravitate more towards death metal, while Ihsahn directed his musical exploration towards his side project, Peccatum. Thus, in 2001, Emperor decided to disband after releasing one final album, , composed entirely by Ihsahn. [...] Ihsahn later recalled that [...] "When we announced the split up in 2001, we didn't think we would <b>do</b> <b>anything</b> <b>more</b> with Emperor ever again...The decision was also based on the feeling that Emperor {{had a lot of}} integrity, and that {{if we were going to}} end it, we should end it while we still created great music. [...] For us, the decision was made in the black metal spirit. Since Samoth and I pulled in different directions, we didn't see any point in continuing. [...] The core of the band wasn't intact anymore". Samoth echoed Ihsahn's position: [...] "At that point, we both had other priorities that we wanted to pursue and we both felt that splitting up Emperor was the best thing to do. [...] We really wanted to focus on other things, and felt it was the only right thing to do".|$|E
