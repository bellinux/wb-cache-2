25|$|Silicon dioxide (SiO2), {{also known}} as silica, {{is one of the}} most well-studied compounds, second only to water. Twelve {{different}} crystal modifications of silica are known, the most common being α-quartz, a major constituent of many rocks such as granite and sandstone. It is also known to occur pure as rock crystal; impure forms are known as rose quartz, smoky quartz, morion, amethyst, and citrine. Some poorly crystalline forms of quartz are also known, such as chalcedony, chrysoprase, carnelian, agate, onyx, jasper, heliotrope, and flint. Other modifications of silicon dioxide are known in some other minerals such as tridymite and cristobalite, as well as the much less common coesite and stishovite. Biologically generated forms are {{also known as}} <b>kieselguhr</b> and diatomaceous earth. Vitreous silicon dioxide is known as tectites, and obsidian, and rarely as lechatelierite. Some synthetic forms are known as keatite and W-silica. Opals are composed of complicated crystalline aggregates of partially hydrated silicon dioxide.|$|E

40|$|The Thermal Cycling Absorption Process (TCAP) {{is used to}} {{separate}} isotopes of hydrogen. TCAP involves passing a stream of mixed hydrogen isotopes through palladium deposited on <b>kieselguhr</b> (Pd/k) while cycling {{the temperature of the}} Pd/k. <b>Kieselguhr</b> is a silica mineral also called diatomite. To aid in the design of a full scale facility, the Thermal Fluids Laboratory was used by the Chemical and Hydrogen Technology Section to compare the heat transfer properties of three different configurations of stainless steel coils containing <b>kieselguhr</b> and helium. Testing of coils containing Pd/k and hydrogen isotopes would have been more prototypical but would have been too expensive. Three stainless steel coils filled with <b>kieselguhr</b> were tested; one made from 2. 0 inch diameter tubing, one made from 2. 0 inch diameter tubing with foam copper embedded in the <b>kieselguhr</b> and one made from 1. 25 inch diameter tubing. It was known prior to testing that increasing the tubing diameter from 1. 25 inch to 2. 0 inch would slow the rate of temperature change. The primary purpose of the testing was to measure to what extent the presence of copper foam in a 2. 0 " tubing coil would compensate for the effect of larger diameter. Each coil was connected to a pressure gage and the coil was evacuated and backfilled with helium gas. Helium was used instead of a mixture of hydrogen isotopes for reasons of safety. Each coil was quickly immersed in a stirred bath of ethylene glycol at a temperature of approximately 100 degrees Celsius. The coil pressure increased, reflecting the increase in average temperature of its contents. The pressure transient was recored as a function of time after immersion. Because of the actual process will use Pd/k instead of <b>kieselguhr,</b> additional tests were run to determine the differences in thermal properties between the two materials. The method was to position a thermocouple {{at the center of a}} hollow sphere and pack the sphere with Pd/k. The sphere was sealed, quickly submerged in a bath of boiling water and the temperature transient was recorded. There sphere was then opened, the Pd/k was replaced with <b>kieselguhr</b> and the transient was repeated. The response was a factor of 1. 4 faster for Pd/k than for <b>kieselguhr,</b> implying a thermal diffusivity approximately 40 percent higher than for <b>kieselguhr.</b> Another implication is that the transient tests with the coils would have proceeded faster if the coils had been filled with Pd/k rather than <b>kieselguhr...</b>|$|E
