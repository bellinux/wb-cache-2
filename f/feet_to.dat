5|$|A moat, {{approximately}} 190 metres (620 <b>feet)</b> <b>to</b> {{the south}} of the castle, was constructed in mediaeval times, likely {{around the time of the}} rebuilding in 1305. A Scheduled Ancient Monument in its own right, the moat encloses approximately an acre of land around the property. The moat may have been an enclosure surrounding farm buildings connected to the castle.|$|E
50|$|Left-foot braking is the {{technique}} of using the left <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> operate the brake pedal in an automobile, leaving the right <b>foot</b> dedicated <b>to</b> the throttle pedal.

5|$|Identified {{risk factors}} for plantar {{fasciitis}} include excessive running, standing on hard surfaces for prolonged periods of time, high arches of the feet, {{the presence of a}} leg length inequality, and flat feet. The tendency of flat <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> excessively roll inward during walking or running makes them more susceptible to plantar fasciitis. Obesity is seen in 70% of individuals who present with plantar fasciitis and is an independent risk factor.|$|E
5|$|In 1953, the {{platforms}} were lengthened at 75th Avenue and Sutphin Boulevard to 660 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> allow E and F {{trains to}} run eleven car trains. The E and F began running eleven car trains during rush hours on September 8, 1953. The extra train car increased the total carrying capacity by 4,000 passengers.

5|$|In 1970, {{a classic}} final {{featured}} the Knicks against the Lakers. In the waning moments of Game 3, with the series tied, Jerry West hit a basket from 60 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> tie the game, a shot which {{became one of}} the most famous ever. However, the Knicks won in overtime and continued their momentum for a 4–3 win, becoming the first team after the Celtics dynasty to win an NBA championship. The Milwaukee Bucks also won their first franchise title, defeating the Baltimore Bullets in 1971.|$|E

5000|$|A nollie is a {{variation}} of the ollie, where the skateboarder uses the front <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> push the nose of the skateboard down and the back foot is slid in a backwards direction to achieve lift-off from the ground; this is the opposite of an ollie, whereby the rider uses the back <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> push down the tail and the front <b>foot</b> <b>to</b> slide forwards. It is similar to a switch ollie riding backwards and Malto has stated in an instructional video: [...] "It's more a like a switch ollie, but from the front." ...|$|R
5|$|Media outlets {{have since}} {{recognised}} Trautmann's reputation, with Trautmann placed unofficially as the 19th greatest goalkeeper of all-time by the Daily Mail. ESPN consider Trautmann {{as one of}} the greatest FA Cup goalkeepers, with Trautmann representing Manchester City in two consecutive FA Cup finals in 1955 and 1956 while his lunge at Peter Murphy's <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> grasp the ball in the 1956 FA Cup Final is rated as the greatest FA Cup save – a save that broke Trautmann's neck.|$|E
5|$|Over {{four years}} after Cold Feet ended, ITV {{executives}} were {{still looking for a}} series that could comfortably replace it.

5|$|The game itself {{continued}} to evolve during this time. Numerous innovations {{to the rules}} and equipment were put forward as the NHL sought to improve {{the flow of the}} game and make the sport more fan-friendly. The NHL played with six men to a side rather than the traditional seven, and was among the first leagues to allow goaltenders to leave their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> make saves. The NHL's footprint spread across Canada as Foster Hewitt's radio broadcasts were heard coast-to-coast starting in 1933.|$|E

5|$|A Floorless Coaster {{is a type}} {{of steel}} roller coaster {{manufactured}} by Bolliger & Mabillard where riders sit with no floor underneath them allowing their <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> swing freely just above the track. Development of the Floorless Coaster began between 1995 and 1996 with Medusa (now known as Bizarro) at Six Flags Great Adventure opening on April 2, 1999, making it the world's first Floorless Coaster. Floorless Coasters also tend to have 3 to 7 inversions incorporated in the layout of the coaster. Recently, Bolliger & Mabillard have used floorless trains on their Dive Coasters, such as Griffon and SheiKra. Though they contain floorless trains, the coasters are still not considered Floorless Coasters as B classifies them as another model. Also, Maurer Söhne have designed their own version of the Floorless Coaster, a variant of their X-Car called X-Car Floorless, but currently do not have any installations.|$|E

5|$|A survey {{conducted}} in 2008 found {{the foundations of}} a rectangular building, oriented north-north-west, {{thought to be the}} remains of a large hall, 33 x 13 metres (108 x 43 <b>feet).</b> <b>To</b> the north of the hall the survey found magnetic anomalies representing a complex of living buildings styled as a manor house. The same survey also found large magnetic anomalies {{in the eastern part of}} the site, which could be buried rubble from the demolition of a farmhouse, or the remains of in-filled cellars which are believed to have been built on the site. Evidence of a footpath around the interior of the site was also discovered. Given the evidence found, it is likely that the anomalies represent more than one phase of construction, though this could not be conclusively proven with the methods used.|$|E
5|$|As of 2014, {{the wind}} {{industry}} in the USA is able to produce more power at lower cost by using taller wind turbines with longer blades, capturing the faster winds at higher elevations. This has opened up new opportunities and in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio, the price of power from wind turbines built 300 <b>feet</b> <b>to</b> 400 {{feet above the ground}} can now compete with conventional fossil fuels like coal. Prices have fallen to about 4 cents per kilowatt-hour in some cases and utilities have been increasing the amount of wind energy in their portfolio, saying it is their cheapest option.|$|E

Garin was first, followed by the mud-soaked figure of Cordang. Suddenly, to the stupefaction of everyone, Cordang slipped and fell on the velodrome's cement surface. Garin could not believe his luck. By the time Cordang was back on his bike, he had lost 100 metres. There remained six laps to cover. Two miserable kilometres in which to catch Garin. The crowd held its breath as they watched the incredible pursuit match. The bell rang out. One lap, there remained one lap. 333 metres for Garin, who had a lead of 30 metres on the Batave.|$|E
