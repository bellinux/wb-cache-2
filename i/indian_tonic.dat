The traditional Napue gin and tonic recipe that won at the IWSC is served with a Fever-Tree <b>Indian</b> <b>Tonic</b> Water, cranberries and rosemary. The rye gin is named after the Battle of Napue fought between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia close to the distillery's location in 1714 during the Great Northern War.|$|E

Townspeople crowd around to buy the bottles, sold for a dollar each (members of Rawley's Black community stand aside, frustrated and envious, as they can't afford to pay that price).|$|R
40|$|Ph. D. (Botany) The most {{well-known}} tonic plants in South Africa {{have been used}} traditionally {{for the treatment of}} a great variety of ailments but aspects of their ethnobotany and chemistry remain poorly studied. Possible relationships between their ethnobotany and pharmacology are mostly speculative. In this study, literature reviews of the ethnobotany of these plants were combined with phytochemical screening studies and bitterness taste testing results in order to establish constituent patterns which may contribute to a scientific rationale for the claimed tonic (stimulating) properties of these plants. The tonic concept and definitions of terms associated with it are often used incorrectly and ambiguously. An analysis of literature on the traditional healing systems across the globe was used to establish the historical and cultural aspects relevant to tonics. This analysis revealed that sickness/illness is usually considered to be a result of imbalance in many cultures, whether this imbalance is between the patient and the environment or {{due to a lack of}} homeostasis in the body. In several healing cultures substances or mixtures of substances are used to rectify these imbalances through proposed effects on several bodily systems concurrently. According to some cultures, as in Eastern and <b>Indian</b> traditional medicine, <b>tonic</b> plants are considered superior to other medicinal plants in that they impart health, strength and a general sense of well-being, as well as being prophylactic. This definition of a tonic plant is consequently broad, but excludes plants merely used as multipurpose medicines. Where these tonics exhibit a specific mode of action, further classification is required, i. e. as bitter, adaptogenic, alterative, adjuvant or stimulant tonics. The South African traditional tonic plants studied were Agathosma species (Rutaceae), Aloe species (Asphodelaceae), Arctopus species (Apiaceae), Artemisia afra (Asteraceae), Balanites maughamii (Balanitacae), Dicoma species (Asteraceae), Harpagophytum procumbens (Pedaliaceae), Hypoxis hemerocallidea (Hypoxidaceae), Muraltia heisteria (Polygalaceae), Sutherlandia species (Fabaceae), Vernonia oligocephala (Asteraceae), Warburgia salutaris (Canellaceae), Withania somnifera (Solanaceae) and Ziziphus mucronata (Rhamnaceae). A detailed compendium of medicinal applications was compiled following a thorough, in-depth scrutiny of the historical and medicinal ethnobotany of each of these species. Such ethnobotanical data is important in understanding the cultural aspects of healing in southern Africa, and provides valuable direction and focus with regards to the phytochemical and pharmacological research of these plants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEthnopharmacological relevanceSeveral {{species of}} Eugenia L. {{are used in}} folk {{medicine}} {{for the treatment of}} various diseases. Eugenia brasiliensis is used for the treatment of inflammatory diseases, whereas Eugenia. uniflora is used for the treatment of symptoms related to depression and mood disorders, and is used in Brazil by the Guarani <b>Indians</b> as a <b>tonic</b> stimulant. Aim of the studyTo investigate the antidepressant-like effect of hydroalcoholic extracts of different plant species of genus Eugenia and to characterize the participation of the monoaminergic systems in the mechanism of action of the specie that afforded the most prominent antidepressant-like efficacy. Materials and methodsIn the first set of experiments, the effects of hydroalcoholic extracts of Eugenia beaurepaireana, Eugenia brasiliensis, Eugenia catharinae, Eugenia umbelliflora and Eugenia uniflora and the antidepressant fluoxetine (positive control) administered acutely by p. o. route were evaluated in the tail suspension test (TST) and locomotor activity was assessed in the open-field test in mice. In the second set of experiments, the involvement of the monoaminergic systems in the antidepressant-like activity of Eugenia brasiliensis was evaluated by treating mice with several pharmacological agonists and antagonists. The effects of the combined administration of sub-effective doses of Eugenia brasiliensis and the antidepressants fluoxetine, imipramine and bupropion were also evaluated. ResultsThe administration of the extracts from Eugenia brasiliensis, Eugenia catharinae and Eugenia umbelliflora, but not Eugenia beaurepaireana and Eugenia uniflora, exerted a significant antidepressant-like effect, without altering locomotor activity. The behavioral profile was similar to fluoxetine. Pre-treatment of mice with ketanserin, haloperidol, SCH 23390, sulpiride, prazosin and yohimbine prevented the reduction of immobility time induced by Eugenia brasiliensis. Treatment with sub-effective doses of WAY 100635, SKF 38393, apomorphine, phenylephrine, but not clonidine, combined with a sub-effective dose of Eugenia brasiliensis decreased the immobility time in the TST. Furthermore, the combined administration of sub-effectives doses of Eugenia brasiliensis with fluoxetine, imipramine and bupropion produced an antidepressant-like effect. ConclusionsThis study show, for the first time, the antidepressant-like effect of species of the genus Eugenia, especially Eugenia brasiliensis, whose effects in the TST seem to be mediated by serotoninergic (5 -HT 1 A and 5 -HT 2 receptors), noradrenergic (Î± 1 -adrenoceptor) and dopaminergic (dopamine D 1 and D 2 receptors) systems...|$|R
