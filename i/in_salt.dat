40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was {{analysed}} chemical and physical parameters of dried salted pork ham and neck. Dry-cured meat is a traditional dry-cured product obtained after 12 - 24 months of ripening under controlled environmental conditions.   Ham and neck was salted by nitrite salt mixture during 1 week. Salted meat products were dried at 4 °C and relative humidity 85 % 1 week after salting. The quality of dry-cured meat is influenced by the processing technology, for example length of drying and ripening period. The average moisture of dried salted pork ham was 63. 77 % and dried salted pork neck was 59. 26 %. The protein content was 24. 87 % <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and significantly lower (20. 51 %) <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck. The value of intramuscular fat <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham was 4. 97 % and 14. 40 % <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck. The salt content was 5. 39 % <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and 4. 83 % <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck. The cholesterol content was 1. 36 g. kg - 1 <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and significant lower <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck (0. 60 g. kg - 1). The value of lightness was 44. 36 CIE L* <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and significantly lower <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck (40. 74 CIE L*). The pH value was 5. 84 <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and 5. 80 <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck. The shear work was 9. 99 kg. s - 1 <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork ham and 6. 34 <b>in</b> dried <b>salted</b> pork neck.

40|$|Salting of fish is a {{traditional}} method for fish preservation which reduces corruption, increase shelf life and is used {{in order to have}} an access to the new markets. In some countries, consuming semi-cooked or raw salted and smoked fish is well-liked.

The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the antimicrobial activity of NaCl on Staphlococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes <b>in</b> <b>salted</b> silver carp. Effect of different concentrations of NaCl (4, 8, 12 %) on behavior of Staphlococcus aureus and Listeria monocytogenes in 10 ˚C during 3 weeks (0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 days) was determined by evaluation of the bacterial growth <b>in</b> <b>salted</b> fish fillets.
