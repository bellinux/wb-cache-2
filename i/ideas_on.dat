The Disquisition is a 100-page essay on Calhoun's definitive and comprehensive <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> government, which he worked on intermittently for six years until its 1849 completion. It systematically presents his arguments that a numerical majority in any government will typically impose a despotism over a minority unless some way is devised to secure the assent of all classes, sections, and interests and, similarly, that innate human depravity would debase government in a democracy.|$|E

Under his government Indian immigrants were by law forbidden to settle in the Orange Free State (1890). This led to a confrontation with the British government and an extensive correspondence between Reitz and the British high commissioner in Cape Town, in which internal sovereignty was claimed and established.|$|E

5|$|Betances is {{considered}} a pioneer of Puerto Rican liberalism. His ideas resulted from his exposure to republicanism and social activism in France through the middle part of the 19th. century.

His <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> race relations alone had {{a major impact on}} economics and the social makeup of the island.|$|E
5|$|Female {{sexuality}} {{is often not}} adequately represented in texts and documents. Until very recently, much {{of what has been}} documented about women's sexuality has been written by men, in the context of male understanding, and relevant to women's associations to men—as their wives, daughters, or mothers, for example. Often artistic representations of female sexuality suggest trends or <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> broad scales, giving historians clues as to how widespread or accepted erotic relationships between women were.|$|E

This book disseminated <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> how to apply computer technologies to create stellar models, while the Stratoscope projects, by taking balloon-borne telescopes above the Earth's turbulence, produced {{some of the finest}} images of solar granules and sunspots ever seen, thus confirming the existence of convection in the solar atmosphere.|$|E

5|$|The early {{plays of}} Henry Fielding mark the {{beginning}} of Fielding's literary career. His early plays span the time period from his first production in 1728 to {{the beginning of}} the Actor's Rebellion of 1733, a strife within the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane that divided the theatrical community and threatened to disrupt London stage performances. These plays introduce Fielding's take on politics, gender, and morality and serve as an early basis for how Fielding develops his <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> these matters throughout his career.|$|E
5|$|The {{improvements}} {{of animal}} husbandry {{in the medieval}} period in Europe went {{hand in hand with}} other developments. Improvements to the plough allowed the soil to be tilled to a greater depth. Horses took over from oxen as the main providers of traction, new <b>ideas</b> <b>on</b> crop rotation were developed and the growing of crops for winter fodder gained ground. Peas, beans and vetches became common; they increased soil fertility through nitrogen fixation, allowing more livestock to be kept.|$|E
