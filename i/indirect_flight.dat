Contraction of the second set of muscles, which run from the back to the front of the thorax, powers the downbeat. This deforms the box and lifts the tergum.|$|E
2500|$|The DPP and the Pan-Green Coalition has {{routinely}} claimed {{there was}} a potential compromise on Taiwan's national security should there be liberal three links, suggesting the PRC could disguise troop carriers as commercial aircraft to invade Taiwan, a charge met by criticism from both the PRC and the Pan-Blue Coalition. In the wake of 13 June 2008 agreements, the DPP {{raised the issue of}} national security again, criticising its plans to open up to eight airports when China would open only five. The eight airports included Hualien and Taitung, which also operate as military airfields, thus creating a security threat. They also expressed concern over the possibility of absconding Chinese tourists. A defense ministry report on 18 May 2008 concluded that direct charter flights would be a national security threat, and the air force has reportedly expressed concern that six of the airports except the Taiwan Taoyuan and Kaohsiung airports have military installations and aircraft. The Vice Minister of National Defense Lin Chen-yi has further recommended to maintain <b>indirect</b> <b>flight</b> routes via a third party’s air space on 23 May 2008. But on 18 June 2008, the Minister of National Defense Chen Chao-min declared that direct flights without the involvement of any third party air space would not pose a threat to national security, saying [...] "The final routes for direct charter flights shall be decided by the Mainland Affairs Council and the Ministry of Transportation and Communications. We will submit recommendations to the MOTC that take national security into consideration, but I do not foresee any problems if the flights travel directly between Taiwan and China".|$|E

40|$|In civil aviation, {{hub-and-spoke}} (HS) {{networks are}} used by all large carriers. The importance of this system implies that many travelers use connecting flights. Nevertheless, only scarce knowledge is available on price formation of these trips. In this paper, {{we focus on the}} fares of connecting intercontinental flights, with one stop and at least one competing direct flight. We develop a simple model of a HS network, with imperfect substitutability between direct and <b>indirect</b> <b>flights</b> and Cournot competition on every route in the network. We test the model empirically, using reported fares for flights from seven European origins, including the five major airports in Europe, to five non-European destinations. We find that the fare of a connecting flight can be expressed as the weighted average of the fare of its direct competitor, the travel times of both flights its costs and the monetary value of the utility attached to the trip. The weight of the direct fare decreases as product diversity increases. © 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{introduces}} {{a new model}} for evaluating connectivity at hub airports. The Hub Connectivity Performance Analyser (HCPA), developed in this context, assesses both schedule- and comfort-related attributes of <b>indirect</b> <b>flights</b> and consolidates the results into two indexes: the Hub Connectivity Performance Index (HCPI) and the Hub Efficiency Index (φ). The proposed methodology is used to derive conclusions about the hub performance and efficiency of two modern influential super-connectors: Turkish Airlines and Emirates. Connectivity at Istanbul Atatürk and Dubai International airports is therefore evaluated for the said carriers and their alliance code-sharing partners. Historical growth and key O&D flows targeted by each carrier are identified and benchmarked to establish the competitive impact of their hubs. Findings indicate that Emirates operates an ultra-efficient hub, which has superior performance to that of Turkish Airlines; however, in a market-breakdown basis, the dominance is split between the two carriers. Given that both Istanbul Atatürk and Dubai International operate near capacity, the study concludes that the way forward for both carriers is either to opt for up-gauging their fleet or targeting higher hub efficiency...|$|R

This capability, like the Saturn V before it, is being developed primarily for crewed lunar missions. However, the tremendous jump in performance offered by the Ares V launch system has tremendous potential for the furtherance of robotic solar system exploration missions as well. Preliminary performance assessments indicate that Ares V could deliver 5 times the payload to Mars as compared to the most capable US expendable launch vehicle available today. Beyond Mars, the outer planets offer a number of high-priority investigations with compelling science. Presently, missions to these destinations are only achievable using <b>indirect</b> <b>flights</b> with gravity assist trajectories and, in many cases, suffer from long flight times. An Ares V with an upper stage could capture these missions using direct flights with shorter interplanetary transfer times that would enable extensive in situ investigations and possibly the return of samples to Earth.

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} a compact and modularised <b>indirect</b> time of <b>flight</b> range imaging camera. These cameras commonly use the Amplitude Modulated Continuous Wave (AMCW) technique. For this technique, an entire scene is illuminated with light modulated at a high frequency. An image sensor is also modulated and the phase shift introduced between the two modulation signals, due to the transit time of the light reflecting off objects in the scene and returning to the camera, is used to measure the distance. The system constructed for this thesis is controlled by a Cyclone III FPGA and is capable of producing full field of view range images in real time with no additional computational resources. A PMD 19 K- 2 sensor is used as the modulatable image sensor, and is capable of modulation frequencies up to 40 MHz. One significant issue identified with this range imaging technology is that the precision of the range measurements are often dependent on the properties of the object being measured. The dynamic range of the camera is therefore very important when imaging high contrast scenes. Variable Frame Rate Imaging is a novel technique that is developed as part of this thesis and is shown to have promise for addressing this issue. Traditional theory for <b>indirect</b> time of <b>flight</b> cameras is expanded to describe this technique and is experimentally verified. A comparison is made between this technique and traditional High Dynamic Range Imaging. Furthermore, this technique is extended to provide a constant precision measurement of a scene, regardless of the properties of the objects in the scene. It is shown that the replacement of the standard phase detection algorithm with a different algorithm can both reduce the linearity error in the phase measurements caused by harmonics in the correlation waveform and ameliorate axial motion error caused by relative motion of the camera and the object being measured. The new algorithm requires a trivial increase in computational power over the standard algorithm and can be implemented without any significant changes to the standard hardware used in <b>indirect</b> time of <b>flight</b> cameras. Finally, the complete system is evaluated in a number of real world scenarios. Applications in both 3 D modelling and mobile robotics are demonstrated and tests are performed for a variety of scenarios including dynamic scenes using a Pioneer 2 robot...|$|R

What determines the capital flight in Hong Kong financial market and whether there is a capital flight round-trip between Hong Kong and mainland China (from Hong Kong’s point of view). This study measures the capital flight in Hong Kong financial market using the direct and <b>indirect</b> capital <b>flight</b> measurements between 1998 and 2009 and the trade mis-invoicing method from 1970 to 2009.

The most important feature is the high frame-rate, to detect very fast events within the acquired scenes. In order to reduce the computational complexity, Time-of-Flight algorithms for single sensor cameras are used. To achieve high-frame rate and high distance measurement accuracy it is important to collect the most part of the reflected light using sensor with very high sensitivity, allowing the implementation of a low-power light source. We designed and developed a single-photon detection based 3 D ranging camera, capable to acquire distance image up to 22. 5 m, with a resolution down to one centimeter. The light source used in this prototype employs 8 laser diodes sinusoidally modulated.
