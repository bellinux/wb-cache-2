5|$|Gary Lockwood, as Lt. Commander Gary Mitchell, had {{starred in}} the title role of Roddenberry's earlier series on NBC, The Lieutenant; Sally Kellerman was cast as Dr. Elizabeth Dehner. Both actors needed silver eyes, which were {{produced}} by an expert contact lens <b>fabricator</b> who sandwiched wrinkled tinfoil between two sclera contact lenses which covered the entire eye. These were outdated even in the 1960s and dangerous {{to the health of the}} actors' eyes. Although Kellerman could insert and remove the prosthetics easily with no discomfort, Lockwood found them almost impossible to use. He needed to raise his face and sight along his nose in order to see through tiny holes in the foil. He was able to use this to enhance his performance as the mutating Mitchell, the unusual gaze giving him an arrogant and haughty demeanor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{survey was}} {{conducted}} in the year to assess soybean processing technologies in Ilorin east and West local government area of Kwara State in Nigeria. Highest percentages of processors (45 %) procure their raw materials from farmers and market places while (45 %) of <b>fabricators</b> obtain theirs from Owode Onirin in Ilorin. Both processors (40 %) and <b>Fabricators</b> (40 %) greatly patronize cooperative societies for their loans. Soycheese (42. 5 %) {{was the most popular}} soybean based food. Traditional method of processing (72. 5 %) was the most popular in comparison to modern equipment’s (27. 5 %).

25|$|The {{automated}} welding procedures {{used by the}} deck boxes <b>fabricator</b> (Shanghai Zhenhua Port Machinery Co. Ltd.) were frequently performed in the rain. Such welding has been long recognized as leading to the cracking of imperfect welds. Such welds were considered by Caltrans management to be of low criticality in this bridge owing to the compressive forces imposed on the deck structure by this particular design. There are also reports of the vendor being uncooperative {{to the concerns of}} Caltrans inspectors and engineers. Owing to the fragility of the old cantilever structure and the possibility of a destructive earthquake, Caltrans felt motivated to avoid further delays in the new span's completion.|$|E
25|$|In {{order to}} give his account of Atlantis verisimilitude, Plato {{mentions}} that the story was heard by Solon in Egypt, and transmitted orally over several generations through the family of Dropides, until it reached Critias, a dialogue speaker in Timaeus and Critias. Solon had supposedly tried to adapt the Atlantis oral tradition into a poem (that if published, was to be greater than the works of Hesiod and Homer). While it was never completed, Solon passed on the story to Dropides. Modern classicists deny the existence of Solon's Atlantis poem and the story as an oral tradition.

25|$|Since those {{involved}} with the production {{had no idea of}} the future value of the stop-motion puppet figures used in the production, many were not preserved. Rankin claimed in 2007 to be in possession of an original Rudolph figure. Nine other puppets—including Santa and young Rudolph—were given to a secretary, who gave them to family members. Eventually seven were discarded. In 2005, the remaining two puppets of Rudolph and Santa were appraised on Antiques Roadshow; the episode aired in 2006 on PBS. At that time, their appraised value was between $8,000 and $10,000. The puppets had been damaged through years of rough handling by children and storage in an attic. Toy aficionado Kevin Kriess bought Santa and Rudolph in 2005; in 2007, he had both puppets restored by Screen Novelties, a Los Angeles-based collective of film directors specializing in stop motion animation with puppet <b>fabricator</b> Robin Walsh leading the project. The figures have been shown at conventions since then.|$|E
25|$|The {{construction}} of each arch is aesthetically appealing in its simplicity, but also structurally clever {{in that it}} takes maximum advantage of wood as a building material while overcoming its inherent structural shortcomings. From a structural perspective, the arch design utilizes the mechanical properties of the material. Wood is strongest {{along the length of}} the grain and weakest along the end grain. The use of short arch components with shallow radii minimized the amount of weaker-end grain exposed to structural forces. The assembly of the arch with several small pieces of wood, the shapes of which are identical from arch to arch, was efficient. It allowed the <b>fabricator</b> to set machines with guides and templates so that cutting the multiple-arch components was a simple task. Furthermore, the design required little material, since each individual arch component has only a shallow radius. Moreover, by using relatively narrow widths of lumber, the chance of warping was minimized. Finally, there was an efficiency realized in transportation, as the small size of the arch components allowed them to be easily stored and shipped.|$|E
25|$|Work on {{the glass}} panels also proceeded. The DVLMF hired Cloud Gehshan Associates {{to assist with the}} {{selection}} of quotations for the panels. Research into the speeches and writings of famous disabled veterans was made, and hundreds of interviews with disabled veterans conducted. More than 700 quotations were gathered, but just 18 of them—representing a wide diversity of voices spread through time—were used. Initially, a New York-based firm was hired to fabricate the glass panels, but this company backed out of the project. Savoy Studios, a glass manufacturing firm located in Portland, Oregon, was then hired to inscribe and fabricate the panels. Individual sheets of glass were purchased from PPG Industries. Savoy Studios used a computer-controlled water jet cutter to carve the text into them. Moon Shadow Glass, a decorative glass <b>fabricator</b> (known for sandblasting artwork onto vandalized bus shelter glass for the TriMet bus system in Portland) used fine-art abrasive blasting to etch the photo-realistic images into the glass. Savoy Studios then used GlassLam, a liquid polymer trademarked by the GlassLam company of Pompano Beach, Florida, to laminate the glass sheets together into a panel. The laminate not only cemented the sheets together, but also filled in any empty spaces between the sheet. Savoy Studios then used a computer-controlled water jet to cut the panels to their final size.|$|E

25|$|Otto Grunf is a {{naturalized}} German-born inventor. He is {{a former}} Luftstreitkräfte mechanic who fought in the First World War, and he defected from the German army after his mechanical incompetence caused the airplane of the Red Baron to crash. He moved to America and changed his last name from Grunt to Grunf to avoid detection, and is mentioned to also serve in Second World War. He serves as the inventor, <b>fabricator</b> and the mechanic of the TNT group. Running gag in the series is his incompetence: he usually designs various Rube Goldberg machines that end up in failure, fails to properly service or change the vehicles or weaponry (driving a 1910s era car that usually explodes while attempting to start it or brandishing an 1880s revolver), or invents things that already exist (he claims to have invented the skateboard, which he named Skate-Grunf). Despite his heroic-like behavior and staunch belief in bravery (as seen by quotes stamped on his T-shirts), {{he is a very}} cowardly man, constantly running from danger. He usually dresses in a World War I-era flying ace uniform with goggles. He is very loyal and devoted to Number One and never is on his odds. His job is usually to drive Number One around New York (in other words, push his wheelchair around).|$|E
