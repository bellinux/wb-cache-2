50|$|The {{wingspan}} is 21-32 mm. The male has a huge, silken tuft {{of golden}} {{hairs on the}} underside of the forewing. It arises from near the base and, when not expanded, lies in an elongate, sac-like fold along the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of the wing.|$|E
50|$|During the {{stiffening}} process, a cloth or Tyvek strip is glued down on {{the inside}} joints of a paperback to reinforce the attachment of the book's covers. A thin but stiff board is then glued {{to the inside of}} both the front and back cover of the book, and the entire book is trimmed slightly on the head, tail, and <b>fore</b> <b>edge,</b> often with an electric guillotine.|$|E
50|$|Flat backs, or books {{without a}} curved spines, should ideally have no swell. Books with rounded backs, or curved spines, however, require swell. Too little swell results in {{insufficient}} backing, {{and the book}} will lack proper shoulders. Too much swell, however, causes the spine to become over-round, and can create a propensity among the middle sections of the book to collapse inwards, falling toward the <b>fore</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E

50|$|The {{cover is}} made with {{a single piece of}} vellum or {{alternative}} material, folded around the textblock, the front and back covers being folded double.

5000|$|In bookbinding, a dos-à-dos binding (from the French meaning [...] "back-to-back") is {{a binding}} {{structure}} {{in which two}} separate books are bound together such that the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of one is adjacent to {{the spine of the}} other, with a shared lower board between them serving as the back cover of both. When shelved, the spine of the book to the right faces outward, while the spine of the book to the left faces the back of the shelf; the text of both works runs head-to-tail.|$|E
50|$|Fishers Island {{represents}} {{a section of}} the same terminal moraine that formed the North Fork of Long Island, which comes ashore at Watch Hill, Rhode Island. During the late phase of the Wisconsin glaciation, glacial Lake Connecticut formed at the retreating <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of the ice sheet, over what is now Long Island Sound; it formed an outlet in its moraine dam at The Race, famous for rip currents, which still separates Fishers Island from the North Fork. Fishers Island is essentially a long barrow of rocky till scoured from the surface of southern Connecticut.|$|E

5000|$|Nag Hammadi {{bindings}} {{were constructed}} with a textblock of papyrus sheets, assembled {{into a single}} section and trimmed along the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> after folding to prevent the inner sheets from extending outward beyond the outer sheets. Because the inner sheets were narrower than the outer sheets after trimming, the width of text varied through the textblock, {{and it is likely}} that the papyrus was not written on until after it was bound; this, in turn, would have made it a necessity to calculate the number of sheets needed for a manuscript before it was written and bound. [...] Covers of Nag Hammadi bindings were limp leather, stiffened with waste sheets of papyrus. The textblocks were sewn with tackets, with leather stays along the inside fold as reinforcement. These tackets also secured the textblock to the covers; on some of the Nag Hammadi bindings, the tackets extended to the outside of the covering leather, while on others the tackets were attached to a strip of leather which served as a spine liner, and which was in turn pasted to the covers. [...] A flap, either triangular or rectangular, extended from the front cover of the book, and was wrapped around the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of the book when closed. Attached to the flap was a long leather thong which was wrapped around the book two or three times, and which served as a clasp to keep the book securely shut.|$|E
50|$|The genus has {{adults with}} large and {{characteristic}} oval shape {{and the body}} is densely covered in short hair. The head behind the eye narrows slightly and the eyes are {{at a distance from}} the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of the pronotum. The edge of the pronotum is not extended to the sides or bent down. The metathoracic scent gland has an ostiole with a peritreme and a deep furrow. The sutures {{on the underside of the}} abdominal segments between 4 and 5; and between 5 and 6 are strongly curved forwards. Many species may swarm seasonally on seeds of specific trees. Melamphaus faber is known to be found in large numbers on Hydnocarpus anthelmetica and H. wightiana in Singapore.|$|E
50|$|Glacial Lake Connecticut formed {{over what}} is now Long Island Sound and coastal Connecticut at the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of the ice sheet of the Wisconsin glaciation, as the lobe of the Laurentide ice sheet began to retreat, some 18 to 20,000 years before present. It was dammed by the {{terminal}} moraine that now forms the spine of Long Island and Fishers Island. About 15,000 BP, the moraine dam that impounded Lake Connecticut failed; the outlet, known as The Race for its tidal rip currents, lies between the North Fork of Long Island and Fishers Island. For a time, much of the lake bed was exposed to wind-driven erosion: the cue is found in soundings that reveal regional unconformities in the sediment bed of Long Island Sound.|$|E

5000|$|The library {{stands on}} the former grounds of Stagg Field. In 1965, the Joseph Regenstein Foundation gave $10 million to the University for {{construction}} of the library. In 1968, the university broke ground and, in 1970, the library opened at the final cost of $20,750,000. The building was designed by the Chicago firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill led by senior architect Walter Netsch. It is built out of grooved limestone, which, from a distance, resembles concrete. University tour guides often remark on the resemblance between each {{of the elements of}} the building's facade and the <b>fore</b> <b>edge</b> of a book. The University of Chicago Graduate Library School was housed in the Joseph Regenstein Library until its closure. Today, the [...] "Reg" [...] is the flagship institution of The University of Chicago Library system, which is considered among the top five in the world for breadth and depth of material, and receives high marks from users (The Princeton Review placed it in the top nine for college students).|$|E
