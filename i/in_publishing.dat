5|$|N. Eldon Tanner {{was made}} second {{counselor}} {{to the president}} of the LDS Church, David O. McKay, in 1963. Tanner met with the director of the BYU library at the time, S. Lyman Tyler, to coordinate LDS historians' work with the LDS Church Archives. Arrington began attending these meetings in 1966. In 1967, Arrington indicated that publisher Knopf was interested <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> a general history of Mormons, and asked for unrestricted access to the LDS Church Archives, which he was granted in January 1968.|$|E

In the 1970s Willy denied rumors, based on drawing style, {{that he had}} been the real artist behind Kaproen, but in 2010 these allegations were confirmed after an investigation demanded by his own family. Unlike his partners, Vandersteen was later not persecuted for his part <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the antisemitic drawings, which were considered collaboration with the Nazis.|$|E
5|$|The Minneapolis–St. Paul area is {{the second}} largest {{economic}} center in the Midwest, behind Chicago. The economy of Minneapolis today is based in commerce, finance, rail and trucking services, health care, and industry. Smaller components are <b>in</b> <b>publishing,</b> milling, food processing, graphic arts, insurance, education, and high technology. Industry produces metal and automotive products, chemical and agricultural products, electronics, computers, precision medical instruments and devices, plastics, and machinery. The city at one time produced farm implements.|$|E
5|$|The patrons {{ensured that}} cricket was financed in the 18th century but their interest, equally {{applicable}} to horse racing and prizefighting, {{was based on}} the opportunities that cricket provided for gambling. Every important match in the 18th century, whether eleven-a-side or single wicket, was played for stakes. The early newspapers recognised this and were more interested <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the odds than the match scores. Reports would say who won the wager rather than who won the match.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} fifteen, Johnson was apprenticed to George Keith, a London {{bookseller}} {{who specialized}} <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> religious tracts such as Reflections on the Modern but Unchristian Practice of Innoculation. As Gerald Tyson, Johnson's major modern biographer, explains, it was unusual for the younger son of a family living in relative obscurity to move to London and to become a bookseller. Scholars have speculated that Johnson was indentured to Keith because the bookseller was associated with Liverpool Baptists. Keith and Johnson published several works together later in their careers, {{which suggests that the}} two remained on friendly terms after Johnson started his own business.|$|E

Gui and Lee Bo both hold 34% of the company's shares (Lee Bo's shares are {{in the name of}} his wife, Sophie Choi), and Lui Bo holds the remaining 32%. In 2014, the company acquired Causeway Bay Books, an upstairs bookstore in the bustling part of Hong Kong.|$|E

5|$|Computer and Video Games {{stated that}} Pilotwings sold over two million copies {{worldwide}} by August 1996. A sequel, Pilotwings 64, was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 as a launch title for its respective system. A second sequel for the Nintendo 64, which showed off the console's capabilities, was cancelled. In 2003, {{it was announced}} that Factor 5 was working on a GameCube incarnation of the Pilotwings series. Development was moved to Nintendo's Wii console shortly thereafter. However, an anonymous blogger claimed in late 2009 that Factor 5 had indeed finished working on it, but that Nintendo was not confident <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> it. Nintendo finally announced a new title in the series, the Nintendo 3DS title Pilotwings Resort, at E3 2010. The new title was released as a launch title for the 3DS in North America on March 27, 2011.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{releasing}} the PC version, Virgin {{was not interested}} <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the game on the PlayStation, feeling that only 3D games would sell for the console. As a result, Cecil contacted Sony Computer Entertainment, who agreed to release the game for the console. In North America, Broken Sword was renamed to Circle of Blood. Cecil was uneasy about the name change, feeling that it gave a wrong impression of what type of game it was. In 1998 however, THQ published the game on the PlayStation platform under its original Broken Sword: The Shadow of the Templars title.|$|E
5|$|During {{his initial}} {{session in the}} {{territorial}} legislature in 1850, Deady served on the judicial committee and helped draft many of the laws in the territory. The Oregon Territory had just been created by the United States Congress in 1848, with the territorial government taking control in early 1849. Following the 1850 to 1851 session, {{the secretary of the}} territory, Edward D. Hamilton, asked Deady to assist <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the laws passed by the legislature for all previous sessions of the legislative assembly.

5|$|French naturalist Auguste Duméril {{erected a}} new genus <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the species as Aphanacanthe reticulatus in 1855 from a {{description}} authored by his countryman Gabriel Bibron, {{who had died}} suddenly, Later Latinised to Aphanacanthus, it was linked to a presumed type species Tetrodon reticulatus, from a manuscript by Bibron. In 1959, Yseult Le Danois equated this species name to Tetractenos hamiltoni, but New Zealand zoologist Graham Hardy later reviewed the specimens labelled as T.hamiltoni and found {{that they should be}} assigned to T.glaber. The genus name Aphanacanthe—not Aphanacanthus, as the original spelling takes priority—would have taken precedence over the current genus name Tetractenos. However, it is a nomen nudum as it does not provide enough detail or information to diagnose or properly describe the species, since Duméril had only written a (French) translation of the genus name—αφανης qui nе parait pas, ἃκανθα, épine ("with no thorns").|$|E
5|$|In England, the {{scientist}} Francis Galton {{heard of this}} work, {{as well as the}} pioneering weather forecasts of Robert Fitzroy. After gathering information from weather stations across the country for the month of October 1861, he plotted the data on a map using his own system of symbols, thereby creating the world's first weather map. He used his map to prove that air circulated clockwise around areas of high pressure; he coined the term 'anticyclone' to describe the phenomenon. He was also instrumental <b>in</b> <b>publishing</b> the first weather map in a newspaper, for which he modified the pantograph (an instrument for copying drawings) to inscribe the map onto printing blocks. The Times began printing weather maps using these methods with data from the Meteorological Office.|$|E

Mentzer got verbal permission to publish it with New Infinities, but since the permission was not in writing TSR filed an injunction to prevent the adventure's sale, although the injunction was later lifted. The legal costs further drained NIPI of capital.|$|E
