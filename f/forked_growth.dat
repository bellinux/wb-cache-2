5|$|The city {{government}} {{is involved in}} the economic development process, helping firms grow and attracting new firms. A portion of sales tax revenues is set aside for this, some going into the Grand <b>Forks</b> <b>Growth</b> Fund. Companies can request low-interest loans or grants from this fund provided they meet certain criteria, such as paying a relatively high wage and doing most of their business outside the city's trade region. The city also contributes to the Grand Forks Region Economic Development Corporation (EDC), a public-private organization that receives funding from banks and other major businesses. The EDC plays a consulting role for businesses, such as identifying suitable sites for expansion or assembling public funding packages. Its other key role is to vet businesses to see if they are suitable for funding by the Growth Fund.|$|R
50|$|As {{the typical}} lateral {{branch of a}} tree and its trunk expand in {{diameter}} at different rates, {{the base of the}} smaller branch becomes occluded in the larger trunk of the tree which is producing a larger increment of growth, and this occluded part of the branch forms a knot that provides substantial additional mechanical support to the attachment as it develops (Fig. 2). This is not the case in tree <b>forks,</b> where the <b>growth</b> rate of both branches is approximately equal, and no occluded knot is formed.|$|R
40|$|The {{bacterial}} SOS {{response to}} unusual levels of DNA {{damage has been}} recognized and studied for several decades. Pathways for re-establishing inactivated replication <b>forks</b> under normal <b>growth</b> conditions have received far less attention. In bacteria growing aerobically {{in the absence of}} SOS-inducing conditions, many replication forks encounter DNA damage, leading to inactivation. The pathways for fork reactivation involve the homologous recombination systems, are nonmutagenic, and integrate almost every aspect of DNA metabolism. On a frequency-of-use basis, these pathways represent the main function of bacterial DNA recombination systems, as well as the main function of a number of other enzymatic systems that are associated with replication and site-specific recombination...|$|R
40|$|The {{major role}} of RecA {{is thought to}} be in helping repair and restart stalled {{replication}} <b>forks.</b> During exponential <b>growth,</b> Bacillus subtilis recA cells exhibited few microscopically observable nucleoid defects. However, the efficiency of plating was about 12 % of that of the parent strain. A substantial and additive defect in viability was also seen for addB and recF mutants, suggesting a role for the corresponding recombination paths during normal growth. Upon entry into stationary phase, a subpopulation (∼ 15 %) of abnormally long cells and nucleoids developed in B. subtilis recA mutants. In addition, recA mutants showed a delay in, and a diminished capacity for, effecting prespore nucleoid condensation...|$|R

40|$|The {{currently}} used growth model for yellowfin tuna (Thunnus albacares) in the Atlantic Ocean is a two stanza model characterized by slow juvenile {{growth in the}} first stanza, and rapid adult growth in the second. This model was developed from age estimates from length-frequency analysis and tag-recapture studies, and did not include very small or very large fish. The current investigation addresses the 2003 ICCAT yellowfin stock assessment recommendation that “research should be conducted to validate the growth curve used for yellowfin tuna. ” In this study, the complete age and growth curve is derived using directly determined age estimates from the daily microstructure of sagittal otoliths from 132 fish (5. 2 - 179 cm FL) caught in the Gulf of Guinea and North Carolina. Using the age estimates and corresponding <b>fork</b> lengths, the <b>growth</b> curve and parameters were derived with the von Bertalanffy growth function which fit the data well. The resulting growth coefficient (k) is 0. 281; theoretical maximum FL, (Linf) 245. 5 cm; and theoretical FL at age zero (to), 0. 042.

The published article is copyrighted by Elsevier {{and can be found}} at: [URL] To the best of our knowledge, one or more authors of this paper were federal employees when contributing to this work. We are studying the impacts of parasites on threatened stocks of Oregon coastal coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch). In our previous studies, we have found high infections of digeneans and myxozoans in coho salmon parr from the lower main stem of West Fork Smith River (WFSR), Oregon. In contrast parr from tributaries of this river, and outmigrating smolts, harbor considerably less parasites. Thus, we have hypothesized that heavy parasite burdens in parr from this river are associated with poor overwintering survival. The objective of the current study was to ascertain the possible effects these parasites have on smolt fitness. We captured parr from the lower main stem and tributaries of WFSR and held them in the laboratory to evaluate performance endpoints of smolts with varying degrees of infection by three digeneans (Nanophyetus salmincola, Apophallus sp., and neascus) and one myxozoan (Myxobolus insidiosus). The parameters we assessed were weight, <b>fork</b> length, <b>growth,</b> swimming stamina, and gill Na+,K+ 36 -ATPase activity. We repeated our study on the subsequent year class and with hatchery reared coho salmon experimentally infected with N. salmincola. The most significant associations between parasites and these performance or fitness endpoints were observed in the heavily infected groups from both years. We found that all parasite species, except neascus, were negatively associated with fish fitness. This was corroborated for N. salmincola causing reduced growth with our experimental infection study. Parasites were most negatively associated with growth and size, and these parameters likely influenced the secondary findings with swimming stamina and ATPase activity levels...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} {{study was conducted}} to assess the effect of PIT tagging on survival and growth of young-of-the-year brown trout (Salmo trutta) and evaluate PIT tag loss as a function of body size at tagging. Transponders (11. 5 mm long and 2. 1 mm in diameter) were injected into the peritoneal cavity of fish ranging from 41 to 70 mm fork length (FL) using hypodermic needles. A total of 145 tagged fish and 136 control fish of similar size were reared over 4 weeks. Logistic regressions show that survival rate reached 95 % for fish ≥ 52 mm FL at tagging (with a tag retention rate > 70 %), and 99 % for fish ≥ 57 mm FL (tag retention rate > 80 %). No significant effect of tagging on <b>growth</b> (<b>fork</b> length and weight) was detected {{at the end of the}} experiment. The specific growth rate varied markedly among PIT-tagged fish regardless of fork length, weight or tag-to-body-weight ratio at tagging. Results suggest that juvenile brown trout larger than 57 mm FL (tag-to-body weight ratio in water < 3. 4 %) can be marked by injection of 11. 5 mm PIT into the peritoneal cavity with negligible effects on survival and growth, but this leads to a relatively high tag rejection rate (up to 20 %) ...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{work in this}} {{laboratory}} {{has indicated}} that in thymine low requiring strains of Escherichia coli, the transit time of a replication fork can be varied without an appreciable effect on the growth rate, simply by varying the thymine concentration in the growth medium. This results in {{a change in the}} DNA concentration and therefore changes the dosage of most genes. I have defined three more precise parameters which have previously been encompassed in the term gene dosage. These I have called gene concentration, relative gene dosage, and gene dosage. On theoretical grounds, these three parameters change in separate and distinct ways {{as a function of the}} replication velocity and as a function of the relative position of the gene on the chromosome. In order to distinguish the relative importance of each of them in determining the overall rate of protein synthesis, I have compared the rate of enzyme synthesis from five genes in a fully repressed or induced state and one in an autogenous state in cultures growing at the same rate but having different transit times. The data permit the following conclusions: (1) The initiation mass is independent of the transit time of a replication <b>fork</b> at one <b>growth</b> rate. (2) Replication is bidirectional. The chromosome origin is near the gene coding for tryptophanase and the terminus near the gene specifying tryptophan synthetase. The data place the origin in the region of 67 minutes on the E. coli linkage map. (3) The output of a gene under conditions when it is subject to regulation by a cytoplasmic effector decreases as its concentration is increased. In addition, I have used the observed differential effect of changes in replication velocity on gene concentration to determine if the replication of the sex factor F is directly coupled to any stage of the chromosome replication cycle. The data preclude the possibility that F replication is coupled to any part of the chromosome replication cycle other than to initiation (or to the replication of genes close to the origin) or, at the growth rate used here, that it occurs at a constant cell mass...|$|R
40|$|Southwestern mixed conifer forests cover {{approximately}} 2. 5 {{million acres}} in Arizona and New Mexico, and provide {{a wide range of}} commercial and noncommercial products. The problem is to develop a management prescription which will benefit the greatest mix of resources. An alternatives analysis predicted that a prescription that included small patch clearcutting, in addition to other stand modifications, would meet this criteria. The two Thomas Creek watersheds, in eastern Arizona, were used to validate and test the responses of the forest resources to the preferred prescription, and to increase the understanding of the mixed conifer forest system. The actual harvest created 63 small patch clearcut and group selection openings, averaging 1 - 2 acres, over 13 % of the South Fork watershed. Overall stand density was reduced 34 % to 132 square feet per acre. The harvest resulted in significant hydrological changes. Average annual streamflow increased by about 45 %, or 1. 72 inches, mostly because of increased winter runoff. A greater proportion of the snowmelt generated streamflow occurred earlier in the spring, while annual peak flows were increased by an average of 66 %, or about 2. 60 cubic feet per second per square mile. The number of days without flow decreased. Average watershed maximum snow water equivalents remained unchanged. The primary causes of the increases were reduced evapotranspiration and increased snow accumulation in the openings; however, it appears that the partially cut stand also contributed to the increases. The treatment benefitted the timber resource. Diameter growth on the South Fork increased for most species compared to the unharvested stand on North <b>Fork.</b> Stand gross <b>growth</b> remained unchanged, but the same volume was being added to fewer trees. The stand, including most openings, is well stocked with adequate numbers of natural and advance regeneration. The Thomas Creek prescription, after 8 years of evaluation, has achieved its objectives of increasing water yields and stand growth while insuring adequate regeneration. It has also benefitted many wildlife species as well as livestock. A similar prescription should increase water yields, by about 15, 000 acre-feet annually, from the Upper Black River Basin without adversely impacting other forest resources...|$|R
