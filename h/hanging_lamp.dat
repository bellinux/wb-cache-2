5|$|One of {{the largest}} groups of {{surviving}} works of art are the seal matrices that appear to have entered Scottish usage with feudalism in the reign of David I, beginning at the royal court and among his Anglo-Norman vassals and then by about 1250 they began to spread to the Gaelicised areas of the country. They would be made compulsory for barons of the king in a statute of 1401 and seal matrices show very high standards of skill and artistry. Examples of items that were probably the work of continental artists include the delicate <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> in St. John's Kirk in Perth, the vestments and hangings in Holyrood and the Medieval maces of the Universities of St Andrews and Glasgow.|$|E
5|$|There is {{relatively}} little information about native Scottish artists {{during the late}} Middle Ages. As in England, the monarchy may have had model portraits used for copies and reproductions, but the versions that survive are generally crude by continental standards. Much more impressive are the works or artists imported from the continent, particularly the Netherlands, generally considered the centre of painting in the Northern Renaissance. The products of these connections included the delicate <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> in St. John's Kirk in Perth; the tabernacles and images of St Catherine and St John brought to Dunkeld, and vestments and hangings in Holyrood; Hugo van Der Goes's altarpiece for the Trinity College Church in Edinburgh, commissioned by James III, the work after which the Flemish Master of James IV of Scotland is named, and the illustrated Flemish Bening Book of Hours, given by James IV to Margaret Tudor.|$|E
25|$|The Onias {{temple was}} not exactly similar to the Temple at Jerusalem, being more {{in the form of}} a high tower; and as regards the {{interior}} arrangement, it had not a candelabrum, but a <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp.</b> The building had a court (τέμενος) which was surrounded by a brick wall with stone gates. The king endowed the temple with large revenues—a fact that may have suggested to the writer of the letters mentioned above the wealth of wood and sacrificial animals.|$|E
5000|$|The {{church is}} unusual {{that there is}} no {{electricity}} or running water. Lighting in the nave is provided by <b>hanging</b> paraffin <b>lamps</b> and by wall mounted lamps with reflectors.

500|$|A {{few months}} later, Haj Amin complained to Chancellor that [...] "Jews were {{bringing}} benches and tables in increased numbers {{to the wall}} and driving nails in{{to the wall and}} <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> on them." ...|$|R
60|$|Gudrun {{looked on}} with delight. The solid wooden floor resounded to the {{knocking}} {{heels of the}} men, the air quivered with the clapping hands and the zither music, there was a golden dust about the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
60|$|The {{small boy}} brought round a small thin volume {{and a great}} greasy-backed one, laying them out {{together}} beneath the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp.</b>|$|E

60|$|Julian was {{standing}} amongst them now, very drawn and pale {{in the dim}} halo of light thrown down from the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp.</b> His answering monosyllable was cold and restrained.|$|E
50|$|The Balfour {{family of}} Stobo Castle {{presented}} {{a number of}} brass <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> to the kirk and one of these {{has been identified as}} being manufactured in Nuremberg by Hans Muller between 1693 and 1701. The others are copies or by other Nuremberg craftsmen.|$|R
60|$|At length {{they arrived}} in the capital, where the public rejoicings were grander and more {{brilliant}} than anywhere else. The queen awaited them in the great hall of the palace, surrounded by her entire court. It was getting dark, and hundreds of coloured <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> were lit to turn night into day.|$|R
25|$|Open stained pine trusses {{spring from}} corbels {{along the walls}} frame the ceiling. They are complemented by {{sandstone}} at the arches between the building sections and surrounding the windows and doors. The nave is lit by <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps.</b> In the chancel the bishop's throne, sedilia, prayer desk and stalls are all oak like the pews. The font is of Aubigny stone on a sandstone shaft.|$|R
60|$|In {{the hallway}} above, the saffron {{light from a}} <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> allowed him to select the gaudy numbers on the doors. He turned the knob of Number 9, entered {{and closed the door}} behind him.|$|E
60|$|By {{this time}} I {{had succeeded in}} raising myself on my elbow, and, by {{the dim light of}} a <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> somewhere down the passage, I was pretty well able to take stock of my surroundings.|$|E
60|$|Mr. Peaseley's eyes {{sought the}} ceiling, and {{rested on the}} <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp,</b> as if nothing short of direct providential {{interference}} could meet the occasion. Yet, as {{the eyes of his}} brother trustees were bent on him expectantly, he nerved himself to say something.|$|E
50|$|The {{interior}} puts forth {{a display}} of wealth and status: arches and columns, decorated with elaborate coffered <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> and fine carpets from the Royal Tapestry Factory. Ornamented ceramic tiles (azulejos) decorate walls, ceilings {{and all manner of}} structures. The luxurious rooms were designed to accommodate kings, presidents, celebrities and other guests of the Ibero-American Exposition of 1929. The floors are marble and wood.|$|R
60|$|When I awoke again, very {{stiff and}} bruised, but much refreshed, night had fallen, for <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> were lit about the room. By their light I saw the chamberlain of whom I have spoken {{standing}} before me. I asked him his errand. With many bows {{he said that}} if I were rested the Inca Upanqui desired my presence that he might speak with me.|$|R
50|$|A large, newly {{constructed}} choir loft looms {{above and}} over the narthex and entrance to the nave, which has a high ceiling with decorative <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps.</b> The framing of the ceiling, {{as well as the}} altar reredos, are made from Narra (Pterocarpus indices), wood donated by Brother Edward Tan, an avid sympathizer of the Church. The pulpit, lectern, pews and transept balconies have richly-carved woodwork with the same theme.|$|R
60|$|At a segregated, {{two-story house}} Father Rogan halted, and mounted the steps with the {{confidence}} of a familiar visitor. He ushered Lorison into a narrow hallway, faintly lighted by a cobwebbed <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp.</b> Almost immediately a door to the right opened and a dingy Irishwoman protruded her head.|$|E
60|$|A {{moment or}} two later M. Ernest Berty, or {{whatever}} his real name may have been, entered the room. Whether he had encountered his exquisite sister on the corridor or the stairs, I could not tell; his face, {{in the dim light}} of the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp,</b> looked impenetrable and sinister.|$|E
60|$|Tom Brangwen, {{with more}} {{particular}} thought, spied {{out what he}} called handy little things for her. He appeared {{with a set of}} new-fangled cooking-pans, with a special sort of <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp,</b> though the rooms were so low, with canny little machines for grinding meat or mashing potatoes or whisking eggs.|$|E
50|$|In the Graphite Pieces (1969-1970), Bollinger spread {{graphite}} dust over the floor, leaving clear {{traces of the}} process of creation while incorporating the sense of openness and expandability that was so important to Bollinger. The ready-made character of Bollinger’s works is especially apparent in the Droplights (<b>hanging</b> <b>lamps)</b> from 1969. Later works with floating tree trunks and barrels show Bollinger’s affinity for water. In 1973, he began working in cast iron.|$|R

50|$|The {{interior}} has plain plaster walls, {{its original}} wooden pews, and wide pine floors. A two-tiered platform {{is at the}} rear. A Farrand & Votey pump organ {{is in front of}} the rear door. It is screened by a paneled balustrade topped with a privacy curtain hung from turned posts that extend above each end of the balustrade. There is painted communion table in the front. Electrical lights have replaced the original kerosene <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps.</b>|$|R
60|$|She bent down, {{with the}} light of a big <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> upon her, and, forgetting the faintness and pain, which was considerable, Dane felt his heart bound within him. In spite of her swift orderliness, the girl's eyes were anxious as well as very pitiful, and there was a tension in her voice.|$|E
6000|$|It was a {{large and}} rather sparely {{furnished}} room, but Miriam and Ralph took no note of anything except the table, which {{stood in the middle}} of the floor, lighted by a <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp.</b> It {{was a large}} table and arranged for eight people with chairs at every place. The woman gave a little laugh, as she said:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|Paul Ruttledge. Help {{me over to}} the candles. I am weak, {{my knees}} are weak. I shall be strong when the words come. I shall be able to teach. [He lights a taper at the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> and tries to light the candles with a shaking hand. JEROME takes the taper from him and lights the candles.] Why are you crying, Jerome? ...|$|E
5000|$|Chai {{says his}} inspirations are {{the play of}} light and shadow in glowing camp fires on the beach, and {{moonlight}} shining through the leaves of palm trees. He wanted to make lamps because, [...] "I wanted to interact with the viewer. What better way than to turn something on?" [...] His work has been described as [...] "cutting edge <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> of intricate interlocking pieces of cut and finished plywood. The effect is origami in thin air with distinctive Hawaii touches." ...|$|R
40|$|Photograph {{of women}} working at sewing {{machines}} in a garment factory in Los Angeles, ca. 1928. Around twenty women are {{seated at a}} long table at center. They are all sitting in identical wooden chairs and are hunched over sewing machines in front of them. There are several vertical rectangular windows {{around the edge of}} the room, and a row of <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> can be seen over the table. Two cardboard boxes can be seen at left, and shelves on the wall hold many spools of thread...|$|R
60|$|Two <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> with crimson shades threw a rosy {{light over}} the table, where, in the centre stood a silver basket, full of irises. Through the open windows the garden was all {{clusters}} of black foliage in the dying light. Moths fluttered round the lamps; Greta, following them with her eyes, gave quite audible sighs of pleasure when they escaped. Both girls wore white, and Harz, who sat opposite Christian, kept looking at her, and wondering why he had not painted her in that dress.|$|R
6000|$|... “He {{had left}} the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> in the cabin burning as usual. It {{was part of his}} plan that {{everything}} should be as usual. Suddenly in the dim glow of the skylight panes a bulky shadow came up the ladder without a sound, made two steps towards the hammock (it hung right over the skylight), and stood motionless. The Frenchman! ...|$|E
60|$|Loyal to his resolution, {{he turned}} away from their parting, turned away from his wife as she stood under the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> to say good-night--away from the sight of her golden head shining so under the light, of her smiling mournful lips; away from the sight of Bosinney's eyes looking at her, so like a dog's looking at its master.|$|E
60|$|Other {{well-known}} {{faces are}} there also, dimly {{outlined in the}} fast-gathering gloom. But everyone notes Citizen-Deputy Déroulède, the idol of the people, as {{he sits on the}} extreme end of a bench on the right, with arms tightly folded across his chest, the light from the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamp</b> falling straight on his dark head and proud, straight brows, with the large, restless, eager eyes.|$|E
60|$|Under {{the arch}} of the Opera House large faces and lean ones, the {{powdered}} and the hairy, all alike were red in the sunset; and, quickened by the great <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> with their repressed primrose lights, by the tramp, and the scarlet, and the pompous ceremony, some ladies looked for a moment into steaming bedrooms near by, where women with loose hair leaned out of windows, where girls--where children--(the long mirrors held the ladies suspended) but one must follow; one must not block the way.|$|R
60|$|The {{room that}} Ayesha {{inhabited}} {{was not very}} large, as we saw by the <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps</b> with which it was lighted. It was plainly though richly furnished, the rock walls being covered with tapestries, and the tables and chairs inlaid with silver, but the only token that here a woman had her home was that about it stood several bowls of flowers. One of these, I remember, {{was filled with the}} delicate harebells I had admired, dug up roots and all, and set in moss.|$|R
50|$|Although Renaissance Revival {{architecture}} was {{in vogue}} at the time, Eames designed this church {{in a more}} austere style he believed was typical of churches in the early Christian era. The church is brick, painted dusky rose. The nave is flanked by stained glass windows by Emil Frei. Also notable are the intricate brass <b>hanging</b> <b>lamps,</b> designed by Eames himself, in form of dark globes. The steeple, buttresses, and arches echo Middle European traditions. Behind the sanctuary is a large mural in earth tones painted by Charles F. Quest.|$|R
