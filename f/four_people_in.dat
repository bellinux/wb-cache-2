5|$|Before Krosa {{struck the}} Philippines, PAGASA issued a number 3 warning signal for {{portions}} of northern Luzon, where winds {{were expected to}} reach over 100km/h (60mph). The agency noted for the potential for flooding and landslides. High winds knocked down trees across Luzon, and left about 80% of Cagayan province without power, {{as well as some}} areas without internet or cellphone service. Portions of the Pan-Philippine Highway were blocked, and in Lal-Lo, Cagayan, a car crashed into a gasoline truck due to power outages. Agriculture damage was estimated at P273million (PHP, $6.3million USD), occurring just {{before the start of the}} harvest. Across the island, the typhoon damaged 32,745houses, including 3,837 that were destroyed, forcing 65,648people to evacuate to storm shelters. Overall, Krosa killed <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> the Philippines, and left P273million (PHP, $6.4million USD) in damage. After the storm, workers quickly restored power lines, while the government provided monetary assistance to storm-ravaged families, after Cagayan was declared a state of calamity. Members of the Philippine military and Department of Public Works and Highways worked to clean up following the storm.|$|E
5|$|Croatian {{authorities}} prosecuted <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> {{connection with}} the 1991 killing of the prisoners of war, and convicted and sentenced them to 15 to 20 years in prison.

In 1998, the Chapel of Nativity of Mary was built in Kusonje at the initiative of the parents of the soldiers who were killed there, and a commemorative plaque containing the names of the 23 killed was placed at the chapel. The events of 1991 and 1993 are commemorated annually in Kusonje, with civilian and military representatives attending. In 2014, a feature film titled Number 55, based on the 1991 events in Kusonje, was released. The title of the film refers to the number of the house where the ZNG troops took shelter on 8–9 September 1991.|$|E
5|$|The Banglapedia project {{originated}} {{when the}} Asiatic Society of Bangladesh {{was working on}} a three-volume study titled History of Bangladesh, 1704-1971 in 1991. The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference, as that project progressed laboriously, culling facts from various libraries. The idea finally led to a concept paper prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994. The Banglapedia project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997, and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor. As the head of the Project Implementation Committee, his task was to plan and manage the project funding. In 1996, some three dozen committees were formed with three to <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> each committee to recommend the entries. Twenty-seven thousand entries were proposed, requiring a 20 volume compendium. Because of financial constraints, the number of entries was cut down to around 6,000. The project officially took off in 1998.|$|E

25|$|The six {{majority}} judges {{decided that}} section 41 {{was indeed a}} transitional provision, which only operated as a restraint on the first law that the Parliament of Australia passed concerning the federal franchise, the Commonwealth Franchise Act 1902. That is, section 41 only protected rights which were in existence before the Franchise Act was passed. No new rights protectable by section 41 could be acquired after that time. Because the <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> this case did not acquire their right to vote in state elections until well after 1902, section 41 did not give them a right to vote in federal elections.|$|E
25|$|On January 13, 1982, the {{northbound}} I-395 span {{was damaged}} by the crash of Air Florida Flight 90.

The crash killed 74 passengers and crew, plus <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> cars on the bridge. The repaired span was renamed the Arland D.

He succumbed to hypothermia and drowned while rescuers worked to rescue the last of the survivors. The name Rochambeau Bridge was shifted to the previously unnamed express-lane bridge.|$|E

He tells Chanie he can beat the impending bad weather if he travels quickly.|$|E
25|$|The {{cooking time}} depends {{primarily}} on the equipment being used, the amount of sunlight at the time, and the quantity of food {{that needs to be}} cooked. Air temperature, wind, and latitude also affect performance. Food cooks faster in the two hours before and after the local solar noon than it does in either the early morning or the late afternoon. Large quantities of food, and food in large pieces, take longer to cook. As a result, only general figures can be given for cooking time. With a small solar panel cooker, {{it might be possible to}} melt butter in 15 minutes, to bake cookies in 2 hours, and to cook rice for <b>four</b> <b>people</b> <b>in</b> 4 hours. With a high performing parabolic solar cooker, you may be able to grill a steak in minutes. However, depending on local conditions and the solar cooker type, these projects could take half as long, or twice as long.|$|E
