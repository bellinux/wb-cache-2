5|$|Chesney's acta, or documents, contain many {{examples}} of him settling judicial disputes, demonstrating how active {{he was in his}} diocese. More than 240 of his acta have survived, many of them concerning the religious houses within his jurisdiction. Chesney was appointed a papal judge-delegate at least once, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> court that the case of Philip de Broy, a canon in Bedfordshire accused of murdering a knight, was heard. The case was one of those that contributed to King Henry's determination that criminous clerks should be subject to royal justice, not just ecclesiastical justice.|$|E
5|$|In 1451, Mehmed {{was focused}} on {{defeating}} the Karamanids and Menteşe in the East, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> intentions to return to Albania. During this brief period of rest, Skanderbeg took up the rebuilding of Krujë and erected a new fortress in Modrica in the Drin Valley near Svetigrad (which had been lost in a 1448 siege) where Turkish forces had previously slipped through unhindered. The fortress was constructed {{in the heat of}} summer within a few months when few Turkish posts were present. This came as a huge blow to Ottoman efforts whose Albanian operations were thus inhibited.|$|E
5|$|Stephen {{responded by}} {{promptly}} moving south, besieging Arundel and trapping Matilda inside the castle. Stephen then {{agreed to a}} truce proposed by his brother, Henry of Blois; the full details of the agreement are not known, but the results were that Matilda and her household of knights were released from the siege and escorted to the south-west of England, where they were reunited with Robert of Gloucester. The reasons for Matilda's release remain unclear. Stephen may have thought <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> own best interests to release the Empress and concentrate instead on attacking Robert, seeing Robert, rather than Matilda, as his main opponent {{at this point in}} the conflict. Arundel Castle was also considered almost impregnable, and Stephen may have been worried that he risked tying down his army in the south whilst Robert roamed freely in the west. Another theory is that Stephen released Matilda out of a sense of chivalry; Stephen had a generous, courteous personality and women were not normally expected to be targeted in Anglo-Norman warfare.|$|E

As the Duke of Brunswick received compensation from the British for every one of his soldiers killed in America, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> best interest to report the deserters as dead, whenever possible.

25|$|Though Joaquín’s {{paternal}} {{grandfather was}} a Liberal his father was already reported as Traditionalist and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> footsteps that Joaquín followed. As a youngster and teenager Bau engaged in local Traditionalist juvenile organisations. He became head of the Tortosa section of Requeté, a formation established in 1909 as a sporting and outdoor grouping for the Carlist youth. He seemed particularly fond of social and charity initiatives, organising Christmas for the poor, working in Patronato Escolar Obrero de la Sagrada Familia and co-founding Sindicatos Católicos Obreros. In the early 1920s he already emerged as a dynamic local politician. Once Primo de Rivera replaced the liberal restauración with dictatorship, Bau enthusiastically engaged in the nascent primoderiverista structures; in 1924 he co-founded the Tortosa branch of Unión Patriótica and became its jefe provincial.|$|E
25|$|For his {{services}} {{on this occasion}} he was rewarded by the king with almost every distinction which <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> power to confer. On the arrival of Alexander at Persepolis, he bestowed upon Peucestas the important satrapy of Persis, but, previous to this, he had already raised him {{to the rank of}} somatophylax (the king's bodyguard), an honour rendered the more conspicuous in this instance by the number of those select officers being augmented on purpose to make room for his admission. At Susa, also, Peucestas was the first of those rewarded with crowns of gold for their past exploits. After this he proceeded to take possession of his government, where he conciliated the favour of the Persians subject to his rule, {{as well as that of}} Alexander himself, by adopting the Persian dress and customs, in exchange for those of Macedonia; whence he is considered a Persophile.|$|E
25|$|The {{occurrence}} of stećci in the Cetina county {{is related to}} the Nelipić noble family efforts to return economic and political power to whom was confiscated Knin in 1345 by king Louis I of Hungary in exchange for Sinj and Cetina county. They thrived with the support from the Vlachs, who for the service were rewarded with benefits and common Vlach law. After many conflicts and death of last noble Nelipić, then Ivan Frankopan, Vlachs supported Stjepan Vukčić Kosača. The ridge stećci of Dalmatian type can be found only in regions of Dalmatia and Southwestern Bosnia, parts ruled by the Kosača noble family. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> interest to settle militant and well organized Vlachs in the most risky part of his realm, to defend from Talovac forces in Cetina and Venice forces in Poljica and the coast. Thus Dalmatian type is found only West and South of Kosača capital Imotski, and later also North after fall of Bosnia.|$|E

25|$|The next king in the {{hierarchy}} was Nedunj Cheliyan III, who is considered {{the greatest of all}} the early Pandyan kings. Since the Pandyan kingdom was considerably larger than a few generations ago, he had to defend it against many neighbors invading from various fronts. Not only did he succeed in defending his territory, he also seems to have advanced into the enemy territories – the southern province of Cholas and eastern province of the Cheras. At one point, it is said that a coalition of his neighbors including the Cheras, Cholas and five other kingdoms, met him at a pitched battle in Talaialanganam, in present-day Tanjore district. Nedunj Cheliyan emerged victorious in the battle that ensued and ended up annexing several new territories to his kingdom. He thus {{came to be known as}} Talaialanganathu Seruvendra Pandyan. The genealogy after this king is not very clear but there are at least four other kings who are thought to have ruled in the immediate succeeding generations. Notable among them were, Musiri Mutriya Cheliyan for the fact that he conquered the town of Musiri on the coast of the Arabian Sea and Ukkirap Peruvaludi for the fact that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> court that the famous poet Tiruvalluvar submitted his much-acclaimed work Tirukkural.|$|E

500|$|Flanagan {{promoted}} the Marngrook theory {{in his novel}} The Call (1996), an historical imagining into Wills' life, and argued in an essay addressed to Wills {{that he must have}} known Aboriginal games as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> nature to play: [...] "There's two things about you everybody seems to have agreed on—you'd drink with anyone and you'd play with anyone." [...] He quotes Lawton Wills Cooke, a descendent of Horace Wills (Tom's brother), who said a family story had been passed down about Tom playing Marngrook as a boy. Family historian T. S. Wills Cooke disputed that such a story existed, calling the Marngrook link [...] "a bridge too far" [...] and a politically correct attempt to rewrite hsitory. Despite a lack of hard evidence in its favour, the theory is often presented as factual. In Moyston, the self-proclaimed birthplace of Australian football, stands an AFL-endorsed monument, unveiled by historian Col Hutchinson, commemorating Wills' childhood in the area playing Marngrook.|$|E
