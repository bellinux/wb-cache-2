5|$|Because each antenna {{was aimed}} to be {{sensitive}} primarily in a single <b>direction,</b> <b>the</b> length of the blips depended on {{the position of the}} target relative to the fighter. For instance, a target located 35 degrees above the fighter would cause the signal in the upper vertical receiver to be maximized, causing a long blip to appear on the upper trace, and none on the lower trace. Although less sensitive directly forward, both vertical antennas could see {{directly in front of the}} fighter, so a target located dead ahead caused two slightly shorter blips, one on either side of the centreline.|$|E
