5|$|Because the feats the Baron {{describes}} are overtly implausible, {{they are}} easily recognizable as fiction, {{with a strong}} implication that the Baron is a liar. Whether he expects his audience to believe him varies from version to version; in Raspe's original 1785 text, he simply narrates his stories without further comment, but in the later extended versions he is insistent that he <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> In any case, the Baron appears to believe every word of his own stories, no matter how internally inconsistent they become, and he usually appears tolerantly indifferent to any disbelief he encounters in others.|$|E

Bond is interrogated by Mr Big, who uses his fortune-telling employee, Solitaire (so named because she excludes men from her life), to determine if Bond <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> Solitaire lies to Mr Big, supporting Bond's cover story. Mr Big decides to release Bond and Leiter, and has one of Bond's fingers broken. On leaving, Bond kills several of Mr Big's men, while Leiter is released with minimal physical harm by a gang member, sympathetic because of a shared appreciation of jazz.|$|E

5|$|Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer) trains a {{temporary}} worker Cathy Simms (Lindsey Broad) {{so that she}} can take her place when she goes on maternity leave. In the break room, the other workers discuss how attractive Cathy is and how excited they are to have her in the office. Pam, being well into her pregnancy, is sensitive about her looks and so becomes offended by their discussion. Most of them respond by assuring Pam that she is, if anything, more sexually attractive than before she was pregnant. Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson), however, argues that sexual attractiveness is a mostly objective quality and pregnant women cannot be sexually attractive, and accuses the others of lying to spare Pam's feelings. Troubled by Dwight's comments, Pam asks her husband Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) if he finds the new temp attractive. Not wanting to upset his wife, Jim tells her that he does not find her replacement attractive, even objectively. Though Jim gives no sign of unease, Pam is convinced that he is lying to her, and enlists the help of the harshly honest Dwight to prove it. After a number of unsuccessful attempts to trick Jim into revealing he finds Pam's replacement attractive, Dwight and Pam convince Jim to submit to a lie detection test {{in the form of a}} retail store's blood pressure tester. At the conclusion of the interview, Dwight triumphantly announces that he recorded hypertension when Jim said he does not find the new temp attractive, but as Jim continues to insist he <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> Dwight admits that he recorded equal hypertension on every question, including Jim's name. Pam realizes that Jim has unusually high blood pressure, which his father also suffers from, and forgets about the issue in order to focus on her husband's health.|$|E

500|$|In August 2013, former Cardinals player Jack Clark accused Pujols {{of using}} performance-enhancing drugs {{on his radio}} show on WGNU in St. Louis. Clark served as the Cardinals' hitting coach during {{the early part of}} Pujols's tenure in St. Louis. [...] On the morning of August 9, Pujols issued a {{statement}} adamantly denying that he had ever taken PEDs. [...] He denounced Clark's allegations as [...] "irresponsible and reckless" [...] and threatened to sue Clark and WGNU over the allegations. Partly due to legal threats from Pujols, InsideSTL Enterprises, which owns WGNU's weekday airtime under a time brokerage agreement, cut ties with Clark. On October 4, 2013, Pujols filed a defamation lawsuit against Clark. In response on October 14, Clark challenged Pujols to both take polygraph tests to resolve who <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had [...] "no knowledge whatsoever" [...] that Pujols ever used PEDs.

However, soon after that, the warp caused by the alien craft begins to snap back and repair the natural order of the universe. Grodin, realizing that everything will be fixed naturally, gathers up Lana Chee and the pilot. Scully and Fletcher arrive at Fletcher’s home, and see Mulder standing by the moving truck. Joanne Fletcher berates Mulder about Scully but he insists that he and Fletcher have swapped bodies. Fletcher goes to help Joanne move a chair and confesses that Mulder <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b> He tells her enough of their past to convince her he is Morris Fletcher. Jeff Smoodge and a group of troops appear at Fletcher's home and detain Mulder, Fletcher, Scully and the flight data recorder in their car. Grodin explains that he is restoring everything and that he reversed the body-swap between the pilot and the old Hopi woman. The warp passes over them and the past few days are rewritten. Mulder and Fletcher are restored to their own bodies and returned to the moment when Fletcher’s troops pulled them over on the highway. This time no ship passes overhead and Mulder and Scully leave uneventfully. After Mulder and Scully leave the highway near area 51, Scully calls from FBI headquarters to tell Mulder that they have escaped reprimand from Director Kersh for going to Nevada. Scully opens her desk drawer to place a file inside and finds the penny and dime that were fused together from the event at the gas station in her desk drawer indicating that while some things have reversed themselves, not everything has. [...] Mulder enters his apartment and finds that Morris Fletcher has completely reorganized and cleaned his apartment and both Mulder and Scully are left to puzzle over their recollection of events.|$|E

2500|$|In any {{scenario}} where {{statements are}} assumed to be either true or false, a person whom we know is consistently lying would paradoxically be a source of truth, by taking the opposite of whatever they say. There are many such paradoxes, the most famous being known as the liar paradox, commonly expressed as [...] "This sentence is a lie", or [...] "This sentence is false." [...] The so-called Epimenides paradox ("All Cretans are liars", as stated by Epimenides the Cretan) is a forerunner of this, though its status as a paradox is disputed. A class of related logic puzzles are known as knights and knaves, in which the goal is to determine who, in a group of people, is lying and who <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth.</b>|$|E

Minister Merk thereupon declared in the interview that no pursuable statements had been proved to be true. The next day she explained in more detail, that the relevant audit report allegations had affected employment law issues and were not pursuable. As far as criminal matters were concerned, the statutes of limitations had already occurred.

2500|$|In Syndicat Northcrest v. Amselem (2004), the Supreme Court {{drew up a}} {{definition}} of freedom of religion under the Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms, mindful of the overlap with section 2(a). [...] The majority found freedom of religion encompasses a right to religious practices if the individual has a sincere belief that the practice is connected to religion. [...] It would not matter whether the practice was needed according to religious authority. [...] If courts can believe an individual <b>is</b> <b>telling</b> <b>the</b> <b>truth</b> in saying a practice is connected to religion, the courts then ask whether the infringement of freedom of religion is severe enough to trigger section 2. [...] The Court also said religious beliefs are vacillating, so courts trying to determine an individual belief should be mindful that beliefs may change. [...] Following this test in Multani v. Commission scolaire Marguerite‑Bourgeoys (2006), the Court found freedom of religion should protect a non-violent Sikh student's right to wear a kirpan (dagger) in school.|$|E
