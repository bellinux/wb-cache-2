40|$|A simple {{lift-off}} {{process was}} developed to rapidly fabricate nanopatterned photofunctional surfaces. Dye molecules of a perylene derivative (PDID) were adsorbed irreversibly on clean silicon through the holes of an <b>electron-beam</b> <b>lithographied</b> polymer mask. The subsequent removal of the mask in a proper solvent results in PDID nanosized regions of width as small as 30 nm for stripes and of diameter as small as 120 nm for dots. Numerical analyses of atomic force microscopy and laser-scanning confocal microscopy images show that the dye molecules are confined to the regions defined by the lithographic process, with the integrated fluorescence intensity being essentially proportional {{to the size of}} the nanofeatures. This demonstrates that a simple organic lift-off process compatible with clean-room technology, and not involving any chemical step, is able to produce photofunctional nanopatterned surfaces, even though the dye is not chemically bonded to the silicon surface.

40|$|This work {{describes}} the <b>electron-beam</b> (e-beam) <b>lithography</b> process developed to manufacture nano interdigital transducers (IDTs) {{to be used}} in high frequency (GHz) surface acoustic wave (SAW) applications. The combination of <b>electron-beam</b> (e-beam) <b>lithography</b> and lift-off process is shown to be effective in fabricating well-defined IDT finger patterns with a line width below 100 nm with a good yield. Working with insulating piezoelectric substrates brings about e-beam deflection. It is also shown how a very thin organic anti-static layer works well in avoiding this charge accumulation during e-beam lithography on the resist layer. However, the use of this anti-static layer is not required with the insulating piezoelectric layer laying on a semiconducting substrate such as highly doped silicon. The effect of the e-beam dose on a number of different layers (of insulating, insulating on semiconducting, semiconducting, and conductive natures) is provided. Among other advantages, the use of reduced e-beam doses increases the manufacturing time. The principal aim of this work is to explain the interrelation among e-beam dose, substrate nature and IDT structure.

The thickness and the oxygen-to-carbon atomic ratio of the pattern are strongly related that decreases progressively with increasing the electron dosage before reaching a steady level. In addition, as the electron dose increases the patterned area also expanded in lateral direction. The observations of the proximity effect are justified with our results and the Monte Carlo simulation of electrons trajectories.

30|$|One of {{the trends}} in this {{research}} field is increasing the working frequency of metamaterials, {{which began in the}} microwave frequency regime, up to the visible light frequency regions, which is several hundreds THz [5].
