5|$|Didsbury derives {{its name}} from the Anglo-Saxon Dyddi's burg, {{probably}} referring to a man known as Dyddi whose stronghold or township <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> low cliff overlooking a place where the River Mersey could be forded. In the 13th century Didsbury was variously referred to as Dydesbyre, Dydesbiri, Didsbury or Dodesbury.|$|E
5|$|The 1988 race {{contained}} a rare spectacle where {{an early morning}} breakaway group held on until the finish: 27 kilometres into the race a group of unknown riders broke away and the pack did nothing to chase them down throughout the race. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> section of cobblestones outside Roubaix that Thomas Wegmuller (SUI) and Dirk Demol (BEL) {{broke away from the}} lead group to try for the victory. As if the success of the breakaway wasn't enough, Paris–Roubaix was about to deliver a cruel irony.|$|E
5|$|The Soviet Union {{initially}} denied {{knowledge of}} the incident, but later admitted shooting down the aircraft, claiming that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> MASINT spy mission. The Politburo of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union {{said it was a}} deliberate provocation by the United States to probe the Soviet Union's military preparedness, or even to provoke a war. The White House accused the Soviet Union of obstructing search and rescue operations. The Soviet Armed Forces suppressed evidence sought by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) investigation, such as the flight recorders, which were released eight years later, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union.|$|E

25|$|The {{manor house}} was {{situated}} {{by what is}} now the east side of Hornsey Road near the junction with Seven Sisters Road. After the manor decayed, a new manor house was built in 1271 (see below) to the south-east; to differentiate it from the original manor and because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> hill, it was called Highbury, from which the area takes its name.|$|E
25|$|Christopher Awdry, {{for whom}} the stories were first devised, {{continued}} writing the stories almost by accident. He was a keen railway enthusiast like his father, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> visit to the Nene Valley Railway that he received the inspiration for his first story. A railwayman's account of a locomotive running out of steam short of its destination became Triple Header, a story in which Thomas, Percy and Duck take on Gordon's Express but find it more than they can handle. Christopher devised three other stories, Stop Thief!, Mind That Bike and Fish.|$|E

This was the only confirmed Argentine air-to-air victory of the war. One of these Pucarás crashed into Blue Mountain on the return flight to Port Stanley and was destroyed—the body of the pilot (Lt. Gimenez) was found in 1986, and was buried with military honours at Port Darwin by his family, the first Argentine relatives to visit the Falklands {{since the end of the}} war.|$|E
25|$|The Orthodox {{believe that}} the state of the soul in Hades can be {{affected}} by the love and prayers of the righteous up until the Last Judgment. For this reason the Church offers a special prayer for the dead on the third day, ninth day, fortieth day, and the one-year anniversary after the death of an Orthodox Christian. There are also several days throughout the year that are set aside for general commemoration of the departed, sometimes including nonbelievers. These days usually fall on a Saturday, since <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> Saturday that Christ lay in the Tomb.|$|E
25|$|The Army {{was showing}} renewed {{interest}} in opening the Mississippi River at just this time, and Porter met two men who would have great influence on the campaign. First was Major General William T. Sherman, a man of similar temperament to his own, with whom he immediately formed a particularly strong friendship. The other was Major General McClernand, whom he just as quickly came to dislike. Later they would be joined by Major General Ulysses S. Grant; Grant and Porter became friends and worked together quite well, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> more strictly professional level than his relation with Sherman.|$|E

25|$|By Lee's estimation, {{the fort}} {{could not be}} reduced by {{bombardment}} or direct assault, only by starvation. As long as supplies could be built up, they would be. The last Confederate supply ship to Fort Pulaski was the small workhorse steamboat Ida. On February 13, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> routine run to the fort down the North Channel. The new battery of Federal heavy guns on the north bank opened {{up for the first}} time. The old side-wheeler ran for Pulaski and the battery got off nine shots before the guns recoiled off their platforms. Union troops went back to work modifying platform construction and resetting the cannon. Two days later Ida ran up the South Channel under the extinguished lighthouse and returned to Savannah through Tybee Creek.|$|E
25|$|After {{holding the}} Crimson Tide to a three-and-out, the Razorbacks' Kyle Dickerson blocked a Jeremy Schatz punt that was {{recovered}} by John Aaron Rees at the Alabama eleven-yard line. The Alabama defense {{was able to}} get a stop and hold Arkansas to a 27-yard Balseiro field goal. The Crimson Tide scored the final points of the game late in the fourth when Croyle connected again with Hall, and this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> five-yard pass to make the final score 24–13. For his 15 tackle performance, DeMeco Ryans was named the SEC Defensive Player of the Week; and for his 275 punting yards that included a 72-yard punt, Jeremy Schatz was named the SEC Special Teams Player of the Week.|$|E
25|$|The south town, Al-Binya, called Villa Nueva ("new town") by the Spaniards, {{was built}} by the Merinids of Abu Yusuf Yaqub ibn Abd Al-Haqq in 1285. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> plateau that had once held the {{industrial}} neighborhood of Iulia Traducta, the Roman Algeciras. The steepness of its perimeter helped its defense, {{so it was not}} necessary to build such strong defenses as those of the Villa Vieja. The Villa Nueva housed the fortress and the troops who had been established in the city. Algeciras had about eight hundred horsemen and twelve thousand crossbowmen and archers, with a total population of thirty thousand people, according to information from captives given to the King of Castile {{in the early days of}} the siege.|$|E

25|$|Hobart Town {{had become}} a town {{dependent}} on external trade. Although many of the primary industries were highly successful, they were never conducted on a scale sufficient to bring long lasting wealth. By the 1830s, the sealing industry had petered out, and although whaling persisted, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> scale diminished from the first twenty years. Despite the decline in these industries, the export of Tasmanian wool continued to thrive. New industries were required to replace the declining trades, and shipbuilding {{was one of the}} new successes for Hobart Town in the 1830s. The quality of the island's hardwood timber resources, combined with excellent port facilities and access to major shipping routes meant that by 1850, Hobart Town was producing more wooden ships than all other Australian ports combined. Hobart built ships plied all of the world's oceans, and could be found as far a-field as the United States and Europe.|$|E
25|$|In May and June 1936, Hindenburg made {{surprise}} {{visits to}} England. In May <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> flight from America to Germany when it flew {{low over the}} West Yorkshire town of Keighley. A parcel was then thrown overboard and landed in the High Street. Two boys, Alfred Butler and Jack Gerrard, retrieved it and found the contents to be a bouquet of carnations, a small silver cross and a letter on official note paper dated May 22, 1936. The letter read: 'To the finder of this letter, please deposit these flowers and cross on the grave of my dear brother, Lt. Franz Shulte, 1 Garde Regt, zu fuss, POW in Skipton cemetery in Keighley near Leeds. Many thanks for your kindness. John P. Shulte, the first flying priest'. Historian Oliver Denton speculates that the June visit {{may have had a}} more sinister purpose: to observe the industrial heartlands of Northern England.|$|E
25|$|From 1909 to 1912, Laue was a Privatdozent at the Institute for Theoretical Physics, under Arnold Sommerfeld, at LMU. During the 1911 Christmas recess and in January 1912, Paul Peter Ewald was {{finishing}} {{the writing of}} his doctoral thesis under Sommerfeld. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>on</b> <b>a</b> walk through the Englischer Garten in Munich in January, that Ewald told Laue about his thesis topic. The wavelengths of concern to Ewald were in the visible region of the spectrum and hence {{much larger than the}} spacing between the resonators in Ewald’s crystal model. Laue seemed distracted and wanted to know what would be the effect if much smaller wavelengths were considered. In June, Sommerfeld reported to the Physikalische Gesellschaft of Göttingen on the successful diffraction of x-rays by Laue, Paul Knipping and Walter Friedrich at LMU, for which Laue would be awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics, in 1914. While at Munich, he wrote the first volume of his book on relativity during the period 1910 to 1911.|$|E
