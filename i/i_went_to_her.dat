500|$|In his written {{confession}} {{released by}} Peruvian police, Van der Sloot recounted that he briefly left {{the hotel to}} get some coffee and bread, and returned to find Flores using his laptop computer without his permission. A police source stated {{that she may have}} found information linking him to the disappearance of Holloway. An altercation allegedly began, and she attempted to escape. According to the aforementioned written confession released by Peruvian authorities, Van der Sloot stated, [...] "I did not want to do it. The girl intruded into my private life [...] [...] [...] she didn't have any right. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and I hit her. She was scared, we argued and she tried to escape. I grabbed her by the neck and hit her." [...] Van der Sloot reportedly stated that he was stoned on marijuana at the time. A detective linked to the case said that Van der Sloot considered getting rid of the body in a suitcase, but decided against it because he would have been stopped at the front desk. He then reportedly drank espresso and took amphetamines to counter fatigue before fleeing.|$|E
2500|$|Nonetheless, {{the early}} years of their {{relationship}} were difficult, as Wrangler and Whiting struggled with Wrangler's homosexuality. When Wrangler shouted at her in a restaurant that he was gay, Whiting responded, [...] "only around the edges, dear." [...] Wrangler explained in an interview : [...] "When I got with Margaret, I knew I had to change course. She would have my bags packed and sitting outside the door when I got home at night and things like that. Plus I would go through massive guilt whenever I did go out with a guy and I was with her. So I finally said that's it. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> one night and said I'm never going to cheat on you again with anybody. So my sex life became very masturbatory. And I'm good at that-very good at that, in fact.". The couple was married from 1994 until his death.|$|E
2500|$|The {{tour was}} among the first concerts {{attended}} by Britney Spears, who commented [...] "I remember the first time <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> show, I was just like 'Oh my God,' I wanted to be her." [...] Spears added, [...] "she just has this presence that you're so drawn to her, you can't keep your eyes off her." [...] Spears' rendition of [...] "Stronger" [...] on the Dream Within a Dream Tour referenced Jackson's performance of [...] "You", performing in a similar vein among masked dancers wearing one-piece attire. Several performances and themes of Spears' Onyx Hotel Tour drew comparisons for its choreography and sensuality, as well as a reworked lounge version of [...] "Baby One More Time" [...] sonically reminiscent of Jackson's [...] "Rope Burn." [...] Spears' following tour The Circus Starring Britney Spears used a circus theme, observed to be partially inspired by segments of the tour. During [...] "Lace and Leather" [...] on the Femme Fatale Tour, Spears performed a lap dance for a selected fan while wearing a boa after a pole dance, considered a direct reference to Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn." [...] An analysis of Rihanna's Last Girl on Earth Tour observed there was [...] "definitely a Janet vibe", particularly comparing Jackson's performance of [...] "Rope Burn", [...] "in which she tied an audience member to a bed and proceeded to seduce them", to Rihanna's rendition of [...] "Skin." [...] The critique added, [...] "Fast forward 13 years later, and there was Rihanna, writhing around on a lucky audience member at the conclusion of Skin off her current Loud album." [...] New Zealand's Stuff.co.nz praised Lady Gaga's Born This Way Ball as the best [...] "pop-star show" [...] since Jackson's Velvet Rope Tour.|$|E
6000|$|... "Tell me," [...] she asked, [...] "there {{is a girl}} {{there on}} that third seat, crying. Am I doing wrong if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and give her money for a night's lodging?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] said Celia, {{thinking}} it was very well for Sir James to say so, {{but he would not}} have been comfortable with Dodo. [...] "Shall <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her?</b> Could <b>I</b> help her, do you think?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And then I {{shall have}} to leave the house in their charge when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> you know, in Virginia. How many miles is it to Virginia, Martin? I should think it must be {{thousands}} of miles." ...|$|R
60|$|I felt {{a respect}} for Miss Jhansi McKenna; and <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> wedding later on.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{and having}} cut the straps, since I {{could not stop}} to untie their knots, lifted the veil.|$|E
60|$|I {{could not}} prevail on myself {{to speak to}} her. So <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room with my note, and knocked at the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you--I am so glad," [...] she said, {{with sweet}} earnestness, holding {{out her hand}} in congratulation. [...] "When may <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her?</b> <b>I</b> should like for <b>her</b> <b>to</b> come and stay here. Do you think she would?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{thinking}} of Emily. For her sake I hope and trust you are wrong. Ought <b>I</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at once? <b>I</b> don't {{know what to}} do!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Keep {{your own}} secrets," [...] he said; [...] "I {{only want to}} spare Mrs. Farnaby a dreadful disappointment. But I must know what I am talking about when <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> Can't {{you tell me how}} you found out this abominable swindle?" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room. In {{the morning}} she had seemed better, but now looked utterly exhausted. She had a letter in her hand.|$|E
6000|$|... "Precisely"--he {{felt himself}} wonderful; [...] "and I {{wanted to be}} no less. She sent for me, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> and that night I left Venice." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After I {{had heard}} this, <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> I supply her with many things, for {{she gets her}} books and other things from me. I said to her: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There's no hurry. I'll {{take time}} to think it over," [...] she replied. [...] "I hate Aunt Jane, of course; so if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>I</b> must be a hypocrite, and pretend <b>to</b> like <b>her,</b> or she never will leave me her property.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hugo," [...] said St. Aldegonde to Mr. Bohun, [...] "I {{wish you}} would tell Bertha to come to me. I want her. She is talking {{to a lot of}} women {{at the other end of}} the room, and, if <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> <b>I</b> am afraid they will get hold of me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then why has {{she treated}} {{me in this}} way? What right have I given <b>her</b> <b>to</b> be my advisor, because <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's church? Mr Maguire is my friend, and it might have come to that, {{that he should be}} my husband. Is there any sin in that, that I should be rebuked?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What do {{you call}} often? No; not often. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> last night because she {{had given me a}} commission. I have seen her three or four times altogether." ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> At {{my first}} step {{she gave a}} little cry and swayed, and had I not taken {{her in my arms}} I believe she would have fallen.|$|E
6000|$|But {{as he went}} {{he again}} {{encountered}} Beatrice. [...] "Tell Mary <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> to-day," [...] said she, [...] "and that I expect her up here to-morrow. If she does not come, I shall be savage." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'Surely of all {{the leading}} hostesses in New York Society there can be few more {{versatile}} than Mrs. Waddesleigh Peagrim. I am amazed every time <b>I</b> <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> delightful home on West End Avenue to see the scope and variety of her circle of intimates. Here you will see an ambassador with a fever....'" ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>went</b> across <b>to</b> <b>her</b> at once, {{with some}} dull obviousness upon my lips.|$|R
60|$|I knew Mrs. Reed had {{not spoken}} for days: was she reviving? <b>I</b> <b>went</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|Then, {{throwing}} her bonnet into a chair, and cutting some cake, she proceeded: 'Such hours as they keep! No one but Jane was up when I came, so <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> room, {{and told her}} I would hear the rights of it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "The world," [...] went on Lady Casterley, [...] "is a {{place of}} facts, not of romantic fancies. You have done more harm than can {{possibly}} be repaired. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> myself. I was very much moved.' If it hadn't been for your foolish conduct----" ...|$|E
60|$|Sylvia {{lived in}} the city, and I {{lived in the}} country, and {{although}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> whenever I could, {{and she and her}} mother dined several times with my grandmother, there were often long stretches, sometimes extending over the greater part of the day, when I did not see her at all.|$|E
6000|$|... "So <b>I</b> did <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her,</b> {{and got on}} {{with her}} very well, too, {{considering}} that I hadn't been there long when another woman came." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{she looks}} at me so pitiful that <b>I</b> <b>goes</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> and puts my arm round her and pats her on the back.|$|R
5000|$|She had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> {{work as a}} {{cryptographer}} at Bletchley Park. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> see <b>her</b> {{there and}} found her ill and exhausted with the long night shifts.|$|R
6000|$|... "That is true," [...] said Olive thoughtfully. [...] "Do you know, girls, {{this evening}} <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{room with a}} message from Mrs. Pickrell, and I do believe she had been crying. Her room looked dreadfully bare and cheerless, too. I think she is very poor. What are we to do, Jean?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'I {{told you}} {{yesterday}} morning that I was going abroad alone. Afterwards I changed my mind--I meant to take her. <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> lodgings for the purpose. I have lived too long amongst sentiments {{for such a}} piece of reality as that. Class has saved me; it has triumphed over my most primitive instincts.|$|E
6000|$|... "But I've {{never met}} a sweeter woman, nor a truer, that I swear. Woman! She's only twenty now! When <b>I</b> <b>went</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> last night, that brute--that Walenn--had found her out again; {{and when he came}} for me, swaggering and bullying--Look!"--he touched a dark mark on his forehead--"I took his throat in my hands, and when I let go--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No more we can,' said Festus, in {{a melancholy}} tone. 'But <b>I</b> must <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> {{and tell her}} the reason. She pulls me in spite of all.' ...|$|R
50|$|GEORGE: If there's any doubt, I do a leave-behind. Keys, gloves, scarf - <b>I</b> <b>go</b> back <b>to</b> <b>her</b> place <b>to</b> pick it up. Date number two.|$|R
6000|$|... "It might disturb my mother. What sleep {{she gets}} {{is in the}} morning. <b>I</b> never <b>go</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> till eleven o'clock, unless I am going out for the day." ...|$|R
