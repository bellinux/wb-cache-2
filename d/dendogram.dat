The present intrusion of high-throughput knowledge has lead to buildup of huge extent of biological data, which in rotate revise the advance of biological studies in a concoction of approaches. This work is mainly focus on constructing the <b>dendogram</b> for Cyclooxygenase of (COX) based on experimental values.

30|$|A cluster {{analysis}} was used to establish the guilds. Original matrices (all data) were transformed (angular transformation y[*]=[*]arcsine x 0.5) to reduce the kurtosis of a variable's distribution. Three <b>dendograms</b> were constructed (habitat, foraging technique, and both dimensions together) using the unweighted pair group method with arithmetic mean (UPGMA) (Sarrías et al. 1996; Gatto et al. 2008) linked to a Euclidean distance matrix (Sarrías et al. 1996; Legendre and Legendre 1998; López de Casenave et al. 2008). The average Euclidean distance between all species pairs was used to determine the level of similarity defining groups (guilds) in both the uni- and bidimensional <b>dendograms</b> (Pöysä 1983; Holmes and Recher 1986; Sarrías et al. 1996; Gatto et al. 2008; López de Casenave et al. 2008). The {{cluster analysis}} and <b>dendograms</b> were calculated with R project package, vers. 2.15. 0 (Project 2012) and the Vegan package, vers. 2.0 - 3 (Oksanen et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Lentil (Lens culinaris Medik.) is an {{important}} source of protein and carbohydrate food for people of developing countries and is popular in some developed countries where they are perceived as a healthy component of the diet. Ten lentil genotypes were tested for grain yield in five different environmental conditions, over two consecutive years to classify thes genotypes for yield stability. Seed yield of lentil genotypes ranged from 989. 3 to 1. 367 kg ha- 1 and the linear regression coefficient ranged from 0. 75 to 1. 18. The combined analysis of variance showed that the effect of environment (E) and genotype by environment (GE) interaction were highly significant while the main effect of genotype (G) was significant at 0. 05 probability level. Four different cluster procedures were used for grouping genotypes and environments. According to <b>dendograms</b> of regression methods for lentil genotypes there were two different genotypic groups based on G plus GE or GE sources. Also, the <b>dendograms</b> of ANOVA methods indicated 5 groups based on G and GE sources and 4 groups based on GE sources. According to <b>dendograms</b> of regression methods for environments there were 5 different groups based on G plus GE sources while the <b>dendograms</b> of ANOVA methods indicated 9 groups based on G and GE sources and 3 groups based on GE sources. The mentioned groups were determined via F-test as an empirical stopping criterion for clustering. The most responsive genotypes with high mean yield genotypes are G 2 (1145. 3 kg ha- 1), G 8 (1200. 2 kg ha- 1) and G 9 (1267. 9 kg ha- 1) and could be recommended as the most favorable genotypes for farmers...|$|R

In this paper, it is assumed that each product variant requires some operations and for each operation there exist some alternative machines. The focus is on grouping the products and consequently, building a <b>dendogram</b> based on commonality.

40|$|The {{construction}} of a <b>dendogram</b> {{on a set of}} individuals is a key component of a genomewide association study. However even with modern sequencing technologies the distances on the individuals required for the {{construction of}} such a structure may not always be reliable making it tempting to exclude them from an analysis. This, in turn, results in an input set for <b>dendogram</b> construction that consists of only partial distance information which raises the following fundamental question. For what subset of its leaf set can we reconstruct uniquely the <b>dendogram</b> from the distances that it induces on that subset. By formalizing a <b>dendogram</b> in terms of an edge-weighted, rooted phylogenetic tree on a pre-given finite set X with |X|> 2 whose edge-weighting is equidistant and a set of partial distances on X in terms of a set L of 2 -subsets of X, we investigate this problem in terms of when such a tree is lassoed, that is, uniquely determined by the elements in L. For this we consider four different formalizations of the idea of "uniquely determining" giving rise to four distinct types of lassos. We present characterizations for all of them in terms of the child-edge graphs of the interior vertices of such a tree. Our characterizations imply in particular that in case the tree in question is binary then all four types of lasso must coincide...|$|E
40|$|Actinomycetes are a {{group of}} prokaryotic organisms {{belonging}} to Gram-positive bacteria and play an important ecological role in recycling substances in the nature. To determine possible established correlation between isolated actinomycetes and its biochemical degradation (xylan, soluble starch, cassava, protein, lipid, uric acid, carboxymethyl cellulose and avicel degradation) and oxidation property (guaiacol), the actinomycetes were isolated from Termes sp. The <b>dendogram</b> was generated from UPGMA analysis with FreeTree software. In this work, 45 strains of actinomycetes were isolated from guts of Termes sp. Among these, 44 isolated strains could degrade protein, soluble starch and cassava starch. Twenty-three strains degraded uric acid and xylan. The isolated strains that able to degrade avicel and oxidize lignin were rare. The morphological character showed the variety of aerial hyphae and spore forming in each strain. The <b>dendogram</b> was constructed based on biodegradation activity of tested strains. The tested strains were classified into 5 clusters. Cluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3, cluster 4 and cluster 5 contained 14, 9, 9, 9 and 4 isolated strains, respectively. The actinomycetes strains showed a similar biodegration activity within a same cluster.

40|$|Single {{particle}} mass spectrometers are sophisticated instruments {{designed to}} measure the sizes and compositions {{of a wide range}} of individual particles in situ, in real-time. They characterize hundreds of thousands or millions of particles, generating vast amounts of rich and complex data, the proper mining of which requires dedicated state of the art tools. The analysis of individual particle mass spectra is particularly difficult because of their high dimensionality—each data point, representing a single particle, includes the 450 mass spectral peak intensities, particle size, and time of detection. The first step is to organize the data; a process typically accomplished by grouping particles of similar attributes. Since the common assumption is that the data should be reduced to become manageable, they are typically classified into a small number of clusters (∼ 10), each of which is represented by an average/representative spectrum. Our approach is quite different. We have developed a data mining and visualization software package we call SpectraMiner that makes it possible to handle hundreds of clusters, limiting loss of information and thus overcoming the boundaries set by traditional statistical data analysis approaches. Data, which often include over 1 million particle spectra, are organized using K-mean clustering algorithm. The clusters are merged into nodes by sequentially combining similar clusters.

30|$|This {{approach}} {{is based on}} an Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering technique which deals with joint activities in the peer review event log. Here, the main idea is to create multiple clusters which are consistent with the activities that each individual performs. Figure  11 (down) shows a <b>dendogram</b> derived from the Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering technique. The technique enabled us to generate flat or disjoint organizational entities by adjusting the <b>dendogram</b> with a threshold (i.e., certain value). As a result, by adjusting the <b>dendogram</b> with a threshold value of 0, we obtained 4 different clusters (meaning there are 4 different groups of individuals with dissimilar roles and duties) within the peer review event log. The first group, cluster 1, included Mr. A as the Editor-in-Chief and head of the organizing committee. The second group, cluster 2, consisted of the Mr. E, Mr. F, Mrs. D, and Ms. G who were in charge of receiving the reviews/feedback from the invited reviewers. The third group, cluster 3, consisted of Ms. B who behaved as a medium between cluster 2 and Mr. C. Thus, Ms. B was constantly in touch with cluster 2 and Mr. C. And consequently, the fourth group, cluster 4, included Mr. C as the secretary of the conference in charge of inviting reviewers, collecting all the reviews, and announcing the board decisions to the authors (i.e., whether the manuscript is accepted or rejected). Therefore, using the Organizational Miner technique we could investigate the data at a higher level of abstraction—compared with the previously mentioned techniques. While the handover of task, similarity of task and working together metrics emphasized more on the individuals and the transactions between individuals; the Organizational Miner and Role Hierarchy Miner technique mainly focused on the teams, groups and hierarchies as a whole.|$|E

To evaluate genetic polymorphism from cysticerci recovered from experimental infections, 4 pigs were infected with T solium eggs obtained from tapeworms released by 3 human carriers, a 10 -year-old female, a 25 -year-old female, and a 44 -year-old male, the 4 th pig was infected {{with a mixture}} of eggs from the 3 tapeworms. Each pig was orally inoculated with 50, 000 eggs. After 16 weeks pigs were humanely euthanized and cysticerci were excised. Parasites recovered from each pig were analyzed by RAPD. The proportion of polymorphic loci and the mean heterozygosity as well as a <b>dendogram</b> and an analysis of principal coordinate and minimum spanning tree were obtained. All four pigs developed viable cysticerci; the percent infection was obtained from the ratio of the number of eggs used for infection and the number of cysticerci counted in each pig after necropsy. Infection varied from 0. 2 to 4. 2 %. The values obtained for the proportion of polymorphic loci (0. 14 - 0. 55) and the average of expected heterozygosity (0. 06 - 0. 22) in the present experimental infection had a broader range than those reported in the literature from natural infections. The <b>dendogram</b> obtained clustered cysticerci into two main groups; the minimum spanning tree allowed to corroborate the data obtained in the <b>dendogram</b> and gave a better discrimination because in a three-dimensional plot it was easier to see that all cysticerci from each tapeworm were clustered amongst themselves. The results obtained could be hypothetically explained because environmental factors and genetic selection agents present in nature influence natural infections but do not participate in experimental ones.
