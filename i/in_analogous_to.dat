When deformed at strain rates up to 10 (- 4) s(- 1), strain hardening occurs, which {{is accompanied by}} grain growth and cavitation at all temperatures. The observed strengthening can be explained only partly by grain growth. The presence of relatively large cavities surprisingly contributes to strengthening, following the Hall-Petch type relationship between stress and mean free path between cavities.

40|$|Abstract — The goal of {{denoising}} is {{to remove}} the noise while preserving the important features as much as possible. By exploring the power of parsimonious wavelet basis representation and statistical decision methods, Donoho and Johnstone [5] pioneered the wavelet shrinkage. However, the performance of traditional wavelet shrinkage is not even as good {{as that of a}} simple multiscale product method (MPM) [22], because the wavelet basis representation in the traditional wavelet shrinkage is not shift-invariant. We numerically reveal the connection between the simple MPM [22] and Donoho-Johnstone’s hard thresholding [5]. Based on the observations and an analysis of the MPM, we propose a softened version of MPM which is <b>in</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> Donoho-Johnstone’s soft thresholding [5]. Thanks to the explicit detection of singularities and the use of both  ¢¡ and ¤£ stopping criteria to reduce the false detection, the performance of the softened MPM is superior to other methods with redundant wavelet representations for the functions of one-dimensional piecewise linear class. Combined with the local variance analysis discussed elsewhere, we extend the new method to two-dimensional image denoising. I...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2015 Protons (H+) play an {{important}} role in controlling cell function and metabolic processes in biological systems. H+ current affects a broad range of biological activities, from ATP synthesis in mitochondria[1] to neuron signaling in the brain. [2, 3] Being able to control H+ transfer with artificial devices would provide new opportunities to study the effect of H+ on biological functions. This understanding will be vital in the development of novel therapies and sensors based on proton flux. This thesis focuses on controlling H+ transfer in biopolymers with artificial devices. I first study the dynamics of palladium hydride (PdHx) as H+ injecting contacts and its use in protonic conducting devices. Two terminal devices with PdHx contacts display memory behavior. With PdHx as contacts, a polysaccharide integrated field effect transistor measures and modulates the flow of H+. By changing the gate voltage, this H+ conducting channel can be turned on or off. <b>In</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> semiconductors, a proton semi-conductor model is developed to describe H+ conduction. At last, I look at the applications of such H+ conducting devices for pH modulation in solution...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{purpose of}} these three papers is not to just revisit the {{modelling}} of unidirectional composites. It {{is to provide a}} robust framework based on physical processes {{that can be used to}} optimise the design and long term reliability of internally pressurised filament wound structures. The results given in paper Parts 1 and 2 concerning the behaviour of unidirectional composites, such as carbon fibre reinforced epoxy resin, are, here, extended to the behaviour of cross-plied composites consisting of unidirectional plies orientated at different angles with respect to the loading direction. In these laminates the plies orientated parallel to the loading direction (at 0 ∘) control the ultimate failure of the composite. This paper shows that the development of fibre breaks <b>in</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> that seen in the studies described in Part 1 and 2. Clustering of fibre breaks, shown by the development of 32 -plets, preceedes failure just before specimen loaded monotonically break but develop in a more stable manner when subjected to steady high level loads. The effect of separating the 0 ∘ plies into thinner layers impedes the development of fibre breaks clusters and increases ultimate lifetimes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractMany {{important}} {{applications of}} rewrite systems, e. g., automated reasoning, algebraic specifications of abstract data types, and functional/equational programming, rely either wholly {{or in part}} on rewrite systems that are constructor-based. In this paper, we study general transformations of rewrite systems that preserve confluence and normal forms. In 1985, Thatte showed that an orthogonal system can be transformed into an orthogonal constructor-based system that preserves normal forms {{up to a certain}} simple homomorphism. In 1988, Thatte claimed that this transformation works for all semiregular (confluent + nonoverlapping) systems. We show that Thatte's transformation fails to preserve confluence and normal forms for semiregular systems. We then introduce the concept of weak persistence and show that Thatte's transformation is correct for all weakly persistent confluent systems. We also give some general conditions that imply weak persistence and show that this class includes as subclasses the following: left-linear, nonoverlapping systems with confluent root overlaps (generalization of orthogonal systems), nonoverlapping noetherian systems with confluent root overlaps, and the nonlinear systems with no overlaps proved confluent by Klop. We show that our transformation scheme for convergent systems can also be applied to systems in which the innermost rewriting relation is confluent. Our results indicate that persistence plays a role in arbitrary confluent systems that <b>in</b> <b>analogous</b> <b>to</b> the role of the no-overlap restriction in left-linear systems; and similarly weak persistence plays a role that is analogous to that of the nonoverlapping restriction for left-linear systems...|$|E
