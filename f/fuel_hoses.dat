50|$|Alongside {{connected}} replenishment {{is a risky}} operation, as two {{or three}} ships running side-by-side at speed must hold to precisely the same course and speed {{for a long period}} of time. Moreover, the hydrodynamics of two ships running close together cause a suction between them. A slight steering error on the part of one of the ships could cause a collision, or part the transfer lines and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses.</b> At a speed of 12 knots, a 1 degree variation in heading will produce a lateral speed of around 20 feet per minute. For this reason, experienced and qualified helmsmen are required during the replenishment, and the crew on the bridge must give their undivided attention to the ship's course and speed. The risk is increased when a replenishment ship is servicing two ships at once.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} {{dramatic}} incidents affected Verstappen at the German Grand Prix. During his first scheduled pitstop during the race, fuel leaked onto the car after the <b>fuel</b> <b>hose</b> was disconnected. The car, with Verstappen in it, was engulfed in flames for several seconds. As was usual at the time, Verstappen had slightly opened the visor of his helmet for the pit stop, but apart from slight burns to his nose, he was uninjured.

Following the Japanese destroyer [...] that had been counterattacking , Leslie and Lieutenant Commander Wade McClusky, from Enterprise, managed to arrive above the Japanese task force at the precise moment its combat air patrol had been drawn down to the deck to repel Yorktowns torpedo bombers, {{and at the moment}} of the First Air Fleet's maximum vulnerability. With the Japanese Zeros too low to be effective, the SBD Dauntlesses of McClusky and Leslie's squadrons poured down through the miraculously open sky to unload their bombs on the Japanese carriers, their hangar decks cluttered with confused ranks of recovered and warming up aircraft, snaking <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses,</b> and stacks of munitions from the various rearmament operations.

5000|$|Off Saipan on 18 June, {{her support}} force was {{subjected}} to almost continuous Japanese air attacks from 1640 to 1830. At 1641, several bombs landed close aboard Neshanic, with no damage to the tanker. A minute later, however, a hundred-pound bomb landed on her cargo deck, aft on the starboard side, amongst drums containing lube oil. The bomb, without piercing the deck and the fuel oil tanks below, set off fires and blew fragments which cut <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> and destroyed fueling station rigs and bridge fittings. The fires, which were brought under immediate control, caused 1st, 2nd and 3rd degree burns to 33 of the damage control party, while retaliation was gained, to some extent, by the splashing of a [...] "Zeke" [...] and a [...] "Tony" [...] by the gun crews. That night the damaged tanker refueled the vessels which, the next day, went out to meet the enemy in what would {{be known as the}} Battle of the Philippine Sea. Neshanic sailed to Eniwetok for repairs and then returned to the Marianas to support the Guam offensive, retiring to Eniwetok again on 26 July. Proceeding from there to San Pedro, she underwent overhaul and returned to the Admiralties on 24 October to serve as station tanker at Manus until 29 January 1945. On that date she sailed for Ulithi, proceeding from there to Saipan, from which she sortied on 21 February to resupply the forces engaged in fighting in the Iwo Jima area. She returned to Ulithi on 7 March, departing again on the 26th to rendezvous with the forces preparing the way for the Okinawa assault. On 1 and 2 April, she remained in the refueling area to the southeast of the Ryūkyūs, proceeding, on the 3rd, to Kerama Retto. For the next five months she continued to provide logistical support for Operation Iceberg, returning to Ulithi when necessary for replenishment.|$|E

40|$|Biodiesel {{is one of}} {{the fast}} growing {{alternative}} fuels for diesel engines in the world with yearly consumption exceeds 300 million gallon. In 2000, the Hong Kong SAR Government has commissioned the University of Hong Kong to conduct a comprehensive evaluation on the performance of biodiesel on in-service diesel-powered vehicles in Hong Kong and to compare the results with those using ultra low sulphur diesel (50 ppm sulphur) currently used in Hong Kong. Three types of biodiesel fuels were tested with different biodiesel/ULSD blending ratios. The whole study comprised of two parts, namely, a chassis dynamometer exhaust emission test (NOx, CO and HC 1) and a diesel lug down test for each of the vehicle tested. The result of the test is positive and confirms the environmental benefit of using biodiesel fuel. However, a very slight increased in NOx concentration is reported. During the course of the study, some issues related to the durability and <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> compatibility have been raised that may affect the road worthiness of vehicles. In order to assess the compatibility of the rubber <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> with biodiesel, a fuel hose compatibility test was performed to study the characteristics of <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> subjected to fuels with different biodiesel percentages and with different durations. Result of the test leads to some recommendations on the use of special <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> for biodiesel fuel. A one-year durability test on three vehicles using biodiesel was carried out to observe the long term effect of biodiesel on vehicles. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Elastomeric {{fingerprinting}} is {{a quality}} control procedure designed to pro-vide a reproducible graphical {{trace of a}} unique rubber compound. Comparative analysis {{between the first and}} subsequent production runs of the rubber compound is made possible and to some extent, quantifiable. This procedure, coupled with industry standard physical tests, will enable rigorous configuration control of the production of rubber goods. This report documents the work done to develop an elastomeric fingerprinting procedure based on acetone extraction, Fourier Transform Infra-Red (FTIR) spectroscopy, and thermogravimetry using Navy rubber <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> as test samples. The elastomeric fingerprinting procedure is intended for use in Government/commercial procurements where the purchaser does not own the rubber compound formulations, yet requires production consistent with the first, opproved rubber product. This report includes both the method development and the refinement of the method, including a draft specification. Additional work is required in the definition of FrIR spectroscopy acceptance criteria and in interlaboratory testing preci-sion before the procedure is fully reliable...|$|E
40|$|Cooper Nuclear Station (CNS) {{returned}} {{one high}} pressure fuel hose to Engine Systems, Inc. (ESI) because CNS had found foreign material within the hose during receipt inspection. This fuel hose {{was one of four}} <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses</b> that had been supplied to CNS by ESI in October 2011. ESI performed an evaluation and found very small pieces of the elastomer tube internal to the hose. Apparently these pieces were introduced during assembly of the end fittings onto the hose during fabrication of the hose assembly. When installed, this fuel hose would be located after the engine fuel filter and before the fuel injection pumps. Foreign material within this hose could migrate to the fuel injection pumps. The entrance of foreign material could impact operability of one or more fuel injection pumps and therefore affect fuel delivery to one or more engine cylinders. This could impact the load carrying capability of the diesel engine or possibly cause complete engine shutdown. Either scenario has the potential to prevent the emergency diesel generator from performing its safety related function. These hoses were supplied only to CNS. 02 - 03 - 12; 03 : 43 PM; # 11 /...|$|E

The special features of the gated polymerization reaction have been studied, the mechanism of the initiation and gating process has been proposed. The procedure increasing the chemical activity of the fible surface on base of the completely-para-aromatic polyamide Tvaron with use of the metal-organic compounds has been shown. To create the covalent bonds on the fibre-rubber boundary the bifunctional compounds both low-molecular ones (glycidilmetaacrylate) and high-molecular ones (epoxy NA) being active relatively to the modified fibre and rubber matrix have been proposed.

40|$|The {{choice of}} rubber {{material}} {{for use in}} sealings and hoses in the fuel system is of great importance. If a wrong type of rubber is used, premature failure during service may occur. This impacts the environmental performance, the safety during driving, uptime and economy of the transport. In this diploma work, rubbers for use in sealing and hoses in the fuel system have been evaluated to assess which materials {{have the potential to}} be used under long-term use in contact with commercial fuels.   Three commercial <b>fuel</b> <b>hoses,</b> nitrile rubber (NBR), hydrogenated nitrile rubber (HNBR), ethylene-acrylic rubber (AEM) and fluorocarbon rubber (FKM) of varying types and compositions have been evaluated in diesel with 7 % RME (rapeseed methyl ester), 100 % biodiesel of RME and ethanol fuel. Tests were performed by immersing the materials in fuel and measure the compression set and changes in properties like volume, hardness, tensile strength and elongation at break.   The results showed that one NBR material, one AEM and all FKM are potential materials for long term use in diesel with 7 % RME. All types of NBR and two types of FKM (terpolymers, peroxide cured) may be used in ethanol fuel. NBR and HNBR were the only rubbers evaluated in biodiesel. NBR and HNBR with an ACN content of ~ 30 % might be used in 100 % RME at lower temperatures for shorter periods. The aging resistance in air was good for HNBR, AEM and FKM but poor for NBR.
