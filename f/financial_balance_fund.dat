Furthermore, the cause of the flypaper effect phenomenon concluded that the financial system of the country that regulate the financial balance between the center and the regions that lead to the flypaper effect phenomenon.

40|$|BackgroundTelestroke is {{recognized}} as a safe and time-efficient way of treating stroke patients. However, admission centers (spokes) are subject to financial charges which can make them reluctant to join the system. We implemented and assessed an economic model supporting our telestroke system, Virtuall, France, which includes one expert center (hub) and six spokes. MethodsThe model is based on payment for the expertise provided by the hub, distribution of charges related to telemedicine according to the fees perceived by the spokes, and transfer of patients between the spokes and the hub. We performed a cost–benefit analysis for all patients included in Virtuall from January 2014 to December 2015 to assess the economic balance in each center. Results 321 patients were prospectively included in the study. Application of the economic model resulted in overall <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> with <b>funding</b> of a dedicated medical service in the hub, and reduced costs directly related to telestroke {{by an average of}} 10 % in the spokes. The conditions generating the highest costs for the spokes were: a patient returning from the hub for re-hospitalization (mean cost of $ 1, 995 /patient); management of patients treated by intravenous thrombolysis without transfer to the hub (mean cost of $ 2, 075 /patient). The most favorable financial condition for the spokes remained simple transfer of patients to the hub and no return (mean cost of $ 329 /patient). ConclusionWe describe an economic model which can be applied to any telestroke system to ensure the optimal balance between hub and spoke centers...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—The paper {{studies the}} {{statistical}} {{correlation between the}} return on assets and some measures of <b>financial</b> <b>balance.</b> The research relies on the assumptions that the <b>financial</b> <b>balance</b> influences most of the indicators of performances of a company. Therefore, we chose the return on assets as dependent variable, as it represents the final result of the company’s business. As independent variables, meaning measures that point out the <b>financial</b> <b>balance,</b> we selected 24 indicators. All these indicators were calculated for 40 Romanian companies listed on Bucharest Stock Exchange and included a period of 4 years between 2007 and 2010. The data required to calculate these indicators were extracted from the annual financial statements of these companies. The study includes two years of economic growth for Romania (2007 and 2008) and two of downturn (2009 and 2010). It is thus expected that most indicators analyzed to worsen {{in the past two}} years. We concluded, at the end of research, that the profitability of the Romanian firms declined {{as a result of the}} economic crisis.
