50|$|Paper with a {{feathered}} edge {{is described as}} having a <b>deckle</b> <b>edge,</b> {{in contrast to a}} cut edge. Machine-made paper may artificially have its edges produced to resemble a <b>deckle</b> <b>edge.</b>|$|E
50|$|A <b>deckled</b> <b>edge</b> {{is also a}} feathery, {{unfinished}} paper edge. Many fine art works, and hand-made, fine art finished, or digital prints <b>deckle</b> the paper <b>edge.</b> Again, as in book printing, this was once considered an imperfection as the byproduct of hand-made paper-making. Now makers use it to create the appearance of greater value.|$|R

5000|$|With the {{appearance}} of smooth edges in the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> slowly emerged as a status symbol. Many 19th-century presses advertised {{two versions of the}} same book: one with edges trimmed smooth and a higher-priced deckle version, which suggested the book was made with higher-quality paper, or with more refined methods. This tradition carried forward into the 20th and 21st centuries. [...] modern deckle is produced by a purpose-built machine to give {{the appearance}} of a true <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> by cutting a smooth edge into patterns. Many modern readers are unfamiliar with the <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> and may see it as a defect; for example, Amazon.com has left notes to buyers that the deckle is not a flaw in the product. A <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> is unrelated to the practice of unopened pages, in which a reader must cut open pages with knife.|$|E

50|$|To {{attract more}} revenue, a luxury edition was printed on <b>deckle</b> <b>edged</b> {{paper with a}} {{circulation}} of 100 copies, and sold at four-times the usual price. This came about as Pfemfert wanted to remain independent, printing no advertisements, but also to regularly attend events such as balls, readings and lecture evenings. He turned down contributions from third parties, such as from Paul Cassirer, who made him such an offer during the war.|$|R
5000|$|The artworks {{were often}} erotic, both Toulouse-Lautrec and before him Legrand making {{detailed}} {{studies of the}} night life of late nineteenth-century Paris. For example, the 1896 Elles ("Women") {{was a series of}} ten Toulouse-Lautrec lithographs and a frontispiece, which Pellet had printed on high quality wove paper, in a small edition of only 100; the paper was left <b>deckle</b> <b>edged,</b> and was specially watermarked [...] "G. Pellet / T. Lautrec"; the women are mostly from Paris brothels, and they are shown relaxing, washing and dressing. Pellet inscribed the Elles prints in the lower right corner in pen with brown ink.|$|R
50|$|Before the 19th century, the <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> was unavoidable, {{a natural}} {{artifact}} of the papermaking {{process in which}} sheets of paper were made individually on a deckle. The deckle could not make a perfect seal against the screen at the edges and the paper slurry would seep under, creating a rough edge to the paper. The <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> could be trimmed off, but this extra step would add {{to the cost of}} the book. Beginning in the early 1800s with the invention of the Fourdrinier machine, paper was produced in long rolls and the <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> became mostly obsolete; although there was some deckle on the ends of the rolls, it was cut off, and the individual sheets cut out from the roll would have no deckle in any case.|$|E
5000|$|A deckle is a {{removable}} wooden frame or [...] "fence" [...] used in manual papermaking. In a related sense, {{it can also}} mean <b>deckle</b> <b>edge</b> paper—a type of paper with rough edges used in the book trade.|$|E

50|$|The only folio set {{produced}} in Klimt's lifetime, Das Werk Gustav Klimts, was published initially by H. O. Miethke (of Gallerie Miethke, Klimt's exclusive gallery in Vienna) from 1908 to 1914 in an edition of 300, supervised personally by the artist. The first thirty-five editions (I-XXXV) each included an original drawing by Klimt, {{and the next}} thirty-five editions (XXXVI-LXX) each with a facsimile signature on the title page. Fifty images depicting Klimt's most important paintings (1893-1913) were reproduced using collotype lithography and mounted on a heavy, cream-colored wove paper with <b>deckled</b> <b>edges.</b> Thirty-one of the images (ten of which are multicolored) are printed on Chine-collé. The remaining nineteen are high quality halftones prints. Each piece was marked with a unique signet—designed by Klimt—which was impressed into the wove paper in gold metallic ink. The prints were issued in groups of ten to subscribers, in unbound black paper folders embossed with Klimt's name. Because of the delicate nature of collotype lithography, {{as well as the}} necessity for multicolored prints (a feat difficult to reproduce with collotypes), and Klimt's own desire for perfection, the series that was published in mid-1908 was not completed until 1914.|$|R
