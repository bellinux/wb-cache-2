Lancashire selected a replacement captain, but when MacLaren returned to England, he re-committed to the club, stating the visit to Australia had improved the health of his wife, and he was reappointed.|$|E

5|$|The {{advent of}} railroads {{in the late}} 19th century led to further {{development}} in the watershed of Darby Creek. Stops along the Pennsylvania Railroad such as Darby, Prospect Park, and Ridley Park increased in population greatly. Concern <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> the creek led Lansdowne residents to raise funds to preserve a stretch of the creek in 1910. In the early 1900s, the major industries in the watershed of Darby Creek included agriculture. However, in modern times, agriculture is only done in a few small areas in the watershed's upper reaches. During this time period, railroads such as the Pennsylvania Railroad, the Philadelphia, Baltimore and Washington Railroad, and the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad crossed the watershed. A gauging station was established on the creek at Landsowne in 1911.|$|E

5|$|The study {{demonstrated}} that two bacterial divisions, Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, constitute over 90% {{of the known}} phylogenetic categories that dominate distal gut bacteria. Using the relative gene frequencies found within the gut these researchers identified 1,244 metagenomic clusters that are critically important <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> the intestinal tract. There {{are two types of}} functions in these range clusters: housekeeping and those specific to the intestine. The housekeeping gene clusters are required in all bacteria and are often major players in the main metabolic pathways including central carbon metabolism and amino acid synthesis. The gut-specific functions include adhesion to host proteins and the harvesting of sugars from globoseries glycolipids. Patients with irritable bowel syndrome were shown to exhibit 25% fewer genes and lower bacterial diversity than individuals not suffering from irritable bowel syndrome indicating that changes in patients’ gut biome diversity may be associated with this condition.|$|E
5|$|For grieving {{parents who}} form {{emotional}} bonds with reborn dolls, some child bereavement counselors advise against parents substituting their deceased child with the dolls. Reborn mothers contend {{that they are}} not replacing children but remembering them. Psychiatrist Sue Varma, teacher at the NYU school of medicine, says mothering reborn dolls rather than just collecting them can become a problem when it is used as prop and becomes the person's only form of socializing. Psychiatrist Gail Saltz with New York Presbyterian Hospital supports the use of reborns for people who do not want to make the commitment of having a real child, and also to comfort bereaved parents. She offers that in this case the reborn may symbolize a step in the grieving process. Concern should only come if someone who lost a baby grows too attached to their reborn because it could indicate their grief is not getting resolved. In this case, the likeness of the doll to the deceased child risks being harmful as a permanent replacement for the grieving parents. Ian James, a doctor at the Centre <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>Health</b> <b>of</b> the Elderly at Newcastle General Hospital in the U.K., said that holding the dolls helps calm elderly residents, helping them feel peaceful and quiet.|$|E
5|$|Mercedes {{begins to}} worry <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> her unborn baby and confides in John Paul. They {{go to the}} {{hospital}} to gain answers, and it is revealed that Mercedes baby had died and they ask her to prepare for induced labour. Mercedes is devastated and later goes to find Joe for support but is left further heartbroken when his half-brother, Jason Roscoe (Alfie Browne-Sykes), tells her that he has left the village following their argument. She is left to face giving birth alone, but is relieved when her family arrive to support her. After giving birth to her son who she decides to name Gabriel, Mercedes is left overwhelmed with grief and the funeral costs. Theresa decides to help raise money for the funeral by doing a naked photo shoot. However, even after the money for the funeral had been gathered, Mercedes is still left heartbroken and distraught. Theresa then decides to make a phonecall to Myra, informing her of the situation and begs her to come home. At Gabriel's funeral, Myra finds Mercedes sitting on the outside bench, and comforts her as she apologize to her for faking her death last year. Mercedes is delighted to see her and they make amends. Her family arrange a mini memorial service for Gabriel at their home where she says goodbye to him. When Joe finds out that Gabriel has died, he finds Mercedes and reveals he is still in love with her and they decide to go on holiday together. On New Year's Eve, Mercedes tells Joe the truth that he is Gabriel's father. Joe is devastated and breaks up with her, and sleeps with Lindsey in retaliation. He later reconciles with Mercedes.|$|E

In contact with air the copper formed compounds that prevented the absorption of vitamins by the intestines.|$|E

Cuba, as one of the last outposts of slavery, also relied on Spain for protection against any potential slave uprisings. As compared to most other Latin American countries at the time, a very large percentage of the Cuban population were Spaniards or their descendants; the native Taíno and Ciboney peoples had mostly disappeared in Cuba early in the colonial period.|$|E

25|$|As {{a growing}} urban area, Ithaca is facing steady {{increases}} {{in levels of}} vehicular traffic on the city grid and on the state highways. Outlying areas have limited bus service, and many people consider a car essential. However, many consider Ithaca a walkable and bikeable community. One positive trend <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> downtown Ithaca is {{the new wave of}} increasing urban density in and around the Ithaca Commons. Because the downtown area is the region's central business district, dense mixed-use development that includes housing may increase the proportion of people who can walk to work and recreation, and mitigate the likely increased pressure on already busy roads as Ithaca grows. The downtown area is also the area best served by frequent public transportation. Still, traffic congestion around the Commons is likely to progressively increase.|$|E
25|$|As <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>health</b> <b>of</b> {{the river}} overall, the dam has of course {{indirectly}} affected it by promoting {{the growth of}} cities and farms along it. However, construction of the dam also has had direct consequences to the morphology and vegetation zones along the river. By raising summer flows much higher than their natural average, and moderating the effects of most floods, the post-dam river supplies an even amount of water to the riparian zone each year, and resultantly vegetation has encroached on the river channel. The dam has vastly reduced the amount of sediment in the Sacramento, and the riverbanks now suffer decreased erosion, slowing the growth of meanders and side-channels. Additionally, nearly all the rock and sand used in the mixing of concrete for the dam was dredged from the river downstream of the dam, further depleting its sediment supply.|$|E
