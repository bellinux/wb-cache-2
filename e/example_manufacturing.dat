50|$|Congestion is {{considered}} a negative externality by economists. An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to third party, often, although not necessarily, {{from the use of}} a public good. For <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air.|$|E
50|$|Productivity that propels {{the desired}} {{economic}} development is what which results from production {{that leads to}} ever-growing links enterprise building. Optimizing productivity is achieved by prioritizing the prodyuction of tolls and machinery {{that are used in}} prroducing more goods.

50|$|First, {{the growth}} of the slowing action causes growth of the {{perceived}} need for investment (e.g. building additional manufacturing capacity). Another factor that can positively contribute to the perceived need to invest is the failure to uphold the performance standard (for <b>example</b> <b>manufacturing</b> error rate). The perceived need to invest positively translates into actually making the investment. The investment made then negatively influences the slowing action (e.g. removal of capacity limits).|$|E
50|$|As of June 2005, Erie's top-ten {{employers}} by size of {{work force}} are the government (6,435 persons, or 30%), manufacturers (5,200 persons, or 24%), medical services (4,774 persons, or 22%), and other (insurance, retail, and public utilities) (4,950 persons, or 23%). This diversity is less apparent among firms with fewer employees, however. For <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{is a significant}} 39% of the local economy among firms with 200 to 500 employees (18 of 46 firms).|$|E
5000|$|Application {{software}} {{can also be}} seen as being either horizontal or vertical. [...] Horizontal applications are more popular and widespread, because they are general purpose, for example word processors or databases. Vertical applications are niche products, designed for a particular type of industry or business, or department within an organization. Integrated suites of software will try to handle every specific aspect possible of, for <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> or banking systems, or accounting, or customer service.|$|E

50|$|The third {{consideration}} {{is how the}} overall transition from an agriculture-based economy to an urban, industrial economy. In the South, industrial growth started with labor-intensive, unskilled industries; for <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> employment increased from 14.5% in 1930 to 21.3% in 1960, but the increase was largest for non-durable goods (Nicholls 1964:26-27). For black males, in the South, agricultural employment dropped from 43.6% in 1940, to 4.9% in 1980; in that same time period, manufacturing employment rose from 14.2%, to 26.9% (Heckman & Payner 1989:148). There was also more pressure for African American women to work outside the home, often for low wages in the domestic service sector; for example, in the late 1930s, female domestics earned $3-8 per week, sometimes a bit less in the South (Thernstrom & Thernstrom 1999:35).|$|E
50|$|For <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> {{activities}} that cause air pollution impose health and clean-up costs {{on the whole}} society, whereas the neighbors of an individual who chooses to fire-proof his home may benefit from a reduced risk of a fire spreading to their own houses. If external costs exist, such as pollution, the producer may choose to produce more of the product than would be produced if the producer were required to pay all associated environmental costs. Because responsibility or consequence for self-directed action lies partly outside the self, an element of externalization is involved. If there are external benefits, such as in public safety, less of the good may be produced than {{would be the case}} if the producer were to receive payment for the external benefits to others. For the purpose of these statements, overall cost and benefit to society is defined as the sum of the imputed monetary value of benefits and costs to all parties involved. Thus, unregulated markets in goods or services with significant externalities generate prices that do not reflect the full social cost or benefit of their transactions; such markets are therefore inefficient.|$|E
5000|$|The GATE {{opened the}} first group in the UK in Feb 2014. The GATE is a Registered Charity and an {{emerging}} network of engineers and non-engineers that share the idea that engineers are responsible for changing engineered systems in order to adapt to reducing fossil fuel and other un-sustainable resources. Transition Engineering is a change management discipline. Like Safety Engineering, Transition Engineering uses and audit and stock-take of current system design and operation to quantify the risks to essential activities and resources over a time-frame of study. The time-frame of study should be commensurate with the lifetime of the assets involved in the activity. An activity is anything that the engineered system supports, for <b>example</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> sewage treatment, mobility, or food preservation. Transition Engineering recognizes that the analytical methods of strategic analysis over a life-cycle time-frame {{are at odds with}} most economic analyses that discount values with time. The strategic analysis carried out by Transition Engineers seeks to avoid stranded investment by recognizing resource risks. A classic example of stranded investments is the North Atlantic Cod Fishery - where the largest number of bottom trawling ships (e.g. those ships responsible for destroying the Cod spawning beds) were manufactured in the year that the fish stocks collapsed.The Global Association for Transition Engineering is registered charity number 1166048, registered with the UK Charity Commission on 14 March 2016.

30|$|This is {{one example}} that shows the {{conservative}} way of thinking. There {{is a big difference}} between the capabilities and resources needed for a small R&D-centered firm with a focus on developing pharmaceuticals and a firm that does everything, including, for <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> marketing, and logistics (Zott and Amit 2010). A different approach would be to work with business partners to overcome some resource constraints (Gulati 1999; Kask and Linton 2013). However, Drug Advance seemed determined not to change how it did things and not to think in novel ways about how to conduct its business processes, which can be considered the opposite of innovativeness (Lumpkin and Dess 1996).|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to study the relationship between human resource management interventionist strategies and organizational change; and flexibility that can make employees more adaptive and receptive to changes.

Structural Equation Modelling (SEM), a hypothesized relationship was tested using Amos 18 that allows test of complex relationships between variables. Our model shows that relationship exists among human resource management interventionist strategies and was consistent with organizational change in the studied industry.

40|$|Object-oriented {{database}} systems (OODBS) {{have gained}} wide attention {{as the most}} promising database technology for non-standard applications like computer aided design and computer integrated manufacturing. Among the most important requirements of these applications which are supported by OODBS are complex object modeling, advanced transaction management, and version management, to mention just a few. Active database systems (ADBS) have reached equal potential for non-standard applications as they offer event driven and constraint driven behavior of the database system necessary for implementing time critical reactions. For <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> plants need timely support of raw material and assemblies to keep going the manufacturing process. Active object-oriented database systems (AOODBS) provide {{the best of both}} worlds.

40|$|Incomplete {{information}} is an omnipresent issue {{when dealing with}} realworld optimization problems. Typically, such limitations concern the uncertainty of given data or the complete {{lack of knowledge about}} future parts of a problem instance. Our work is devoted to investigations on how to cope with incomplete information when solving scheduling problems. The particular problem class we consider is the class of machine scheduling problems which plays an important role within combinatorial optimization. These problems involve the temporal allocation of limited resources (machines) for executing activities so as to optimize some objective. Scheduling problems are apparent in many applications including, for <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing</b> and service industries but also compiler optimization and parallel computing. There are two major frameworks for modeling limited information in the theory of optimization. One deals with stochastic information, the other with online information. Within these models, we desig...|$|E
40|$|Statistical {{process control}} (SPC) descibes a widely-used set of {{approaches}} used to de- tect shifts in processes in, for <b>example,</b> <b>manufacturing.</b> Among these are charts". Control charts and other SPC techniques {{have been in}} use {{since at least the}} 1950 s, and, because they are comparatively unsophisticated, are often used by management or op- erations personnel without formal statistical training. These personnel will often have experience with the popular spreadsheet program Excel, but may have less training on a mainstream statistical package. Base Excel does not provide the ability to draw control charts directly, although add-ins for that purpose are available for purchase. We present a free add-in for Excel that draws the most common sorts of control charts.

40|$|Introduction Real-time {{systems are}} playing an {{increasingly}} {{vital role in}} today's society. Such systems include for <b>example</b> <b>manufacturing,</b> aerospace, robotics or military systems. In these real-time applications, computing systems must control a controlled system and keep it in a safe state. So, computing system operations have to be perform within a given maximum time. Serious damages can result from an unguaranteed deadline, then exceeding a given delay (critical delay) is often classed as a system breakdown. While scheduling real-time tasks, the critical delay {{has to be taken}} into account first and the classical scheduling performance criteria as CPU utilization, throughput, equal allocation or response time are only examinated in second position. Time constraints have repercussions on the computing systems which have to be robust and predictable. Then the operating system must include services dedicated to time management, tasks management or interrupts management, which ar...|$|E
