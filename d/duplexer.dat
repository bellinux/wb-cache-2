During World War I, she became flagship of Battleship Division 9, commanded by Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman. Sent {{to reinforce the}} British Grand Fleet in the North Sea, she conducted blockade and escort duties. She twice {{came into contact with}} German U-boats, and is believed to have accidentally sunk one. She returned to the United States {{at the end of the}} war, and began taking on patrol and training duties. New York was fitted with XAF RADAR in February 1938, including the first United States <b>duplexer</b> so a single antenna could both send and receive.|$|E

25|$|In most cases, the {{receiver}} does not detect the return while the signal is being transmitted. Through {{the use of}} a <b>duplexer,</b> the radar switches between transmitting and receiving at a predetermined rate.|$|E

50|$|Modern <b>duplexers</b> {{often use}} nearby {{frequency}} bands, so the frequency {{separation between the}} two ports is also much less. For example, the transition between the uplink and downlink bands in the GSM frequency bands may be about 1 percent (915 MHz to 925 MHz). Significant attenuation (isolation) is needed to prevent the transmitter's output from overloading the receiver's input, so such <b>duplexers</b> will employ multi-pole filters. <b>Duplexers</b> are commonly made for use on the 30-50 MHz ("low band"), 136-174 MHz ("high band"), 380-520 MHz ("UHF"), plus the 790-862 MHz ("800"), 896-960 MHz ("900") and 1215-1300 MHz ("1200") bands.|$|R
50|$|Along {{with the}} {{repeater}} units, most stations utilize <b>duplexers.</b> These are notch filters usually in {{an array of}} six, eight, and sometimes four units. They separate the transmitter and receiver signals from each other so one antenna and coaxial line can be utilized. While this solution is very efficient and easy to install, factors such as humidity and temperature can affect the performance of <b>duplexers,</b> so in most configurations a dryer is installed to keep humidity out of the <b>duplexers</b> and coaxial cable, along with heated buildings in which they are installed in. Excellent quality coaxial cable, connectors, and antennas must also be used, as a single-antenna is not as forgiving as a dual antenna system since any RF leakage or poor connection can greatly decay the reliability and performance of the repeater. In some applications, cables going from the repeater and <b>duplexers</b> must be tuned to mitigate these issues.|$|R
25|$|This {{new system}} {{operated}} at 106MHz (2.83 m) and had simplifications of the antenna, elimination of lobe-switching, {{and the addition}} of a <b>duplexer</b> developed by Zahl. Overall, there was a sacrifice in accuracy, but thus was balanced by ease in maintenance and greater range (up to 240 miles).|$|E
500|$|Stubs are not {{the only}} format of filter than can be used. [...] In principle, any filter {{structure}} could be applied to impedance matching, but some will result in more practical designs than others. [...] A frequent format used for impedance matching in waveguide is the stepped impedance filter. [...] An example {{can be seen in the}} <b>duplexer</b> pictured in figure 13.|$|E
500|$|She {{remained}} with the Pacific Fleet training {{as part of}} the series of Fleet Problems until 1937. That year she was selected to carry Admiral Hugh Rodman, the President's personal representative for the coronation of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth, and New York took part in the Grand Naval Review of 20 May 1937 as sole U.S. Navy representative. In 1937, eight /75 caliber AA guns in two quadruple mounts were added to improve the light AA armament. New York was fitted with XAF radar in February 1938, including the first United States <b>duplexer</b> so a single antenna could both send and receive. This made her the second ship to be outfitted with radar after the destroyer [...] The tests conducted on New York led to similar radars being installed on the [...] and [...] cruisers as well as newer battleship [...] For several years, she served primarily as a training ship for midshipmen and newly enlisted sailors.|$|E

50|$|Circuit blocks {{which have}} more than two ports include {{directional}} couplers, power splitters, circulators, diplexers, <b>duplexers,</b> multiplexers, hybrids and directional filters.|$|R
500|$|A {{diplexer}} is {{a device}} used to combine two signals occupying different frequency bands {{into a single}} signal. [...] This is usually to enable two signals to be transmitted simultaneously on the same communications channel, or to allow transmitting on one frequency while receiving on another. (This specific use of a diplexer is called a <b>duplexer.)</b> The same device {{can be used to}} separate the signals again {{at the far end of}} the channel. [...] The need for filtering to separate the signals while receiving is fairly self-evident but it is also required even when combining two transmitted signals. [...] Without filtering, some of the power from source A will be sent towards source B instead of the combined output. [...] This will have the detrimental effects of losing a portion of the input power and loading source A with the output impedance of source B thus causing mismatch. [...] These problems could be overcome with the use of a [...] directional coupler, but as explained in the previous section, a wideband design requires a filter design for directional couplers as well.|$|E
2500|$|The post-1958 Pirinçlik {{system had}} eight {{separate}} radar sets or channels, {{each with its}} own , transmitter, <b>duplexer,</b> receiver, and data display unit. These eight channels fed electromagnetic energy into sixteen fixed beams formed by the two antennas, each channel, or transmitter-receiver combination, being time-shared between two beams. Pneumatically driven switches operated on a three-second cycle to power each beam alternately for 1.5 seconds. There were antenna feeds for two additional beams which could be made to function with some patchwork in the wiring.|$|E
50|$|The <b>duplexer</b> is {{a filter}} that {{provides}} {{isolation of the}} transmitter leakage to its own receiver. In a mobile connected device, the transmitter and receiver {{are linked to the}} same antenna by means of a <b>duplexer.</b> <b>Duplexer</b> isolation of > 45 dB is considered feasible by the industry. If the <b>duplexer</b> isolation is not sufficient then the handset may experience self-desensitization. Multi-mode, multi-band handsets often have mode- and band-specific duplexers. <b>Duplexer</b> technology affects choice of duplex separation and centre band gap which have been designed for the APT band plan with these considerations in mind.|$|E
50|$|Any anomaly or {{fault with}} the antenna or antenna feed cable will reflect {{transmitter}} power {{back into the}} receiver, possibly causing the receiver to be overloaded. The reflected power will quickly exceed the <b>duplexer's</b> filtering ability.|$|R

50|$|In same-band repeaters, {{isolation}} between transmitter {{and receiver}} can be created by using a single antenna and a device called a <b>duplexer.</b> The device is a tuned filter connected to the antenna.

50|$|To prevent self-desensitization, a <b>duplexer</b> must {{attenuate}} Tx emissions at the own Rx {{frequency band}} below the Rx noise floor. This leads typically {{to at least}} a 45 dB attenuation requirement at the own Rx frequency band. Implementing this attenuation requirement is a simple matter with the suggested 2x50 MHz arrangement {{by the use of}} a dual <b>duplexer</b> because the own UL and DL bands are separated by much wider separation distance the 8 MHz {{that would have been the}} case if a single <b>duplexer</b> is applied. The center gap will also determine whether competitive networks can share base station sites with minimum interference and protective site filtering complexity.|$|E

50|$|The maximum {{bandwidth}} of an RF filter or <b>duplexer</b> for a terminal at this frequency range is today around 30-35 MHz. Any arrangement that efficiently uses the 108 MHz bandwidth {{in the frequency}} range 698-806 MHz must thus {{have more than one}} <b>duplexer.</b> “Dual duplexer” means that the handset has 2 duplexers, one per sub band as illustrated in figure 8.|$|E
50|$|When {{the cavity}} {{magnetron}} was first developed, {{its use in}} microwave RDF sets was held up because the <b>duplexers</b> for VHF were destroyed by the new higher-powered transmitter. This problem was solved in early 1941 by the T-R switch developed at the Clarendon Laboratory of Oxford University, allowing a pulse transmitter and receiver to share the same antenna without affecting the receiver.|$|R

40|$|This work {{makes an}} {{overview}} of the progress made during the last decade with regard to a novel class of IC compatible piezoelectric devices employing plate-guided micro-acoustic waves in micromachined thin film membranes. This class of devices, originally proposed by the author in 2005, is referred to as either thin film Lamb wave resonators (LWR) or piezoelectric contour-mode resonators (CMR) both employing thin film AlN membranes. Their principle of operation is complementary to the so called thin film bulk acoustic resonators (FBAR), while employing the same technological platform. FBARs are currently widely employed in commercial filters and <b>duplexers</b> for telecom applications. Thin film Lamb wave resonators have shown unique performance in both frequency control and sensing applications. Here we demonstrate high quality factors Lamb wave resonators for low noise and thermally stable performance and discuss their application in high resolution gravimetric and pressure sensors. Ongoing research activities will be further outlined. These are focused on the development of RF Transformer-filters and <b>duplexers</b> with performance comparable to their FBAR counterparts. A specific emphasis is put on the ability of these devices to operate in contact with liquids in view of advanced Bio-sensor applications...|$|R
50|$|A typical {{diplexer}} {{may have}} around 30 dB isolation between its L and H ports. That isolation {{is sufficient for}} many applications, but it is insufficient to allow simultaneous reception and transmission on one antenna. If the transmitter emits 1 kW, then 1 W of that signal would appear at the receiver; that 1 W may be enough power to overload the receiver. Diplexers designed for simultaneous reception and transmission have more stringent isolation requirements and are known as <b>duplexers.</b>|$|R
