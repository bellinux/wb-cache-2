25|$|I saw Owen and {{the other}} two players put their head in their hands and fired {{thinking}} it would perhaps do as a dejection pic. To be honest, had it happened earlier in the game when I had more time and things were less frantic, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> deleted it as you couldn't make out the faces on the crowd {{on the back of the}} camera, and it was only when I pulled it up on the laptop later that I realised what I had.|$|E

At the time I {{had already been}} playing two or three years, {{and it seemed like}} I had been playing a long time. I thought I’d never be able to change the way I played. The reality of the {{situation}} was that I hadn’t been playing very long at all, and I probably could have spent {{the same amount of time}} learning to play right handed. I did have a go at it, but I just didn’t have the patience. It seemed impossible to me. I decided to make do with what I had, and I made some plastic fingertips for myself. I just persevered with it.|$|E

Banks said, [...] "If I'd stayed on, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> gone down the acting route instead of writing. University isn't for everyone and I discovered that the other writers I know didn't finish their courses either. It was certainly the best thing that happened to me." ...|$|E

5000|$|All I {{have ever}} {{wanted was to}} be a writer. Unfortunately, the editors have decreed otherwise. But 'if it doesn't kill you....' The years of {{rejection}} have forced me to walk in paths and directions <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> not <b>have</b> if I'd been successful, to probe the limits of my ability and find a way past them and to look at things with an ever more critical and creative eye. The best is yet to come.|$|R

[...] "...if not for the controversy, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> hardly <b>have</b> paid attention to this subplot. For my money {{the best part of the}} episode was Claire’s preparation and debate for the council election, which featured some fine physical comedy from Julie Bowen as Claire physically fought her instinct to roll her eyes and point her finger." ...|$|R
500|$|Some {{have speculated}} that Clark's {{inexperience}} at giving [...] "soundbite" [...] answers hurt him in the media during his primary campaign. The day after he launched his campaign, for example, {{he was asked if}} he would have voted for the Iraq War Resolution, which granted President Bush the power to wage the Iraq War, a large issue in the 2004 campaign. Clark said, [...] "At the time, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> voted for it, but I think that's too simple a question," [...] then [...] "I don't know if I would have or not. I've said it both ways because when you get into this, what happens is you have to put yourself in a position—on balance, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> voted for it." [...] Finally, Clark's press secretary clarified his position as [...] "you said you would have voted for the resolution as leverage for a UN-based solution." [...] After this series of responses, although Clark opposed the war, The New York Times ran a story with the headline [...] "Clark Says He Would Have Voted for War". Clark was repeatedly portrayed as unsure on this critical issue by his opponents throughout the primary season. He was forced to continue to clarify his position and at the second primary debate he said, [...] "I think it's really embarrassing that a group of candidates up here are working on changing the leadership in this country and can't get their own story straight... I would have never voted for war. The war was an unnecessary war, it was an elective war, and it's been a huge strategic mistake for this country." ...|$|E
500|$|Cameron sketched Jack's nude {{portrait}} of Rose for a scene which he feels has {{the backdrop of}} repression. [...] "You {{know what it means}} for her, the freedom she must be feeling. It's kind of exhilarating for that reason," [...] he said. The nude scene was DiCaprio and Winslet's first scene together. [...] "It wasn't by any kind of design, although I couldn't have designed it better. There's a nervousness and an energy and a hesitance in them," [...] Cameron stated. [...] "They had rehearsed together, but they hadn't shot anything together. If I'd had a choice, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> preferred to put it deeper into the body of the shoot." [...] Cameron said he and his crew [...] "were just trying to find things to shoot" [...] because the big set [...] "wasn't ready for months, so we were scrambling around trying to fill in anything we could get to shoot." [...] After seeing the scene on film, Cameron felt it worked out considerably well.|$|E
500|$|... "The Winds of Winter" [...] saw the {{departure}} of several cast members and recurring guest actors from the series. Notables included Dean-Charles Chapman, whose character, King Tommen Baratheon, committed suicide in the episode. Before appearing {{in the role of}} Tommen, which was originally portrayed by actor Callum Wharry, Chapman appeared in the third season of the series as Martyn Lannister, a minor character who was also killed off. Chapman stated that he found out about his character's death the night before the initial table read for the season, saying [...] "I was in my hotel, minding my own business, and I got a phone call. I picked up the phone, and instantly, I knew it was coming. It was David Benioff and Dan Weiss, the two creators of the show, and they stated the facts. But they did it really nice. I couldn't have asked for a better way to have that news broken to me. Them telling me beforehand really helped me out, otherwise I would have been in a state when I read it in the scripts. <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> cried." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1992, he {{described}} his Roxy Music tenure as important to his career: [...] "As a result of going into a subway station and meeting , I joined Roxy Music, and, {{as a result of}} that, I have a career in music. If I'd walked ten yards further on the platform, or missed that train, or been in the next carriage, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been an art teacher now".

2500|$|In 1891, U.S. Senator Philetus Sawyer {{allegedly}} offered La Follette a bribe to {{side with}} him in a court case against former state officials. La Follette was outraged by Sawyer's proposal; the experience profoundly affected his nascent political career as, by his own lights: “Nothing else ever came into my life that exerted such a powerful influence upon me as that affair. It was the turning point, in a way, of my career. Sooner or later <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> done what I did in Wisconsin. But it would have been later.

2500|$|Grohl {{hoped to}} keep his {{anonymity}} and release the recordings in a limited run under the title [...] "Foo Fighters", taken from the World War II term [...] "foo fighter", {{used to refer to}} unidentified flying objects. [...] "Around the time that I recorded the first FF tape, I was reading a lot of books on UFO's. Not only is it a fascinating subject, but there's a treasure trove of band names in those UFO books!" [...] he said. [...] "So, since I had recorded the first record by myself, playing all the instruments, but I wanted people to think that it was a group, I figured that FOO FIGHTERS might lead people to believe that it was more than just one guy. Silly, huh?" [...] Continuing, Dave Grohl insisted that a more appropriate name could have been chosen. [...] "Had I actually considered this to be a career, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> called it something else, because it's the stupidest fucking band name in the world." ...|$|E

I want you to remember, Luke, that I am no longer very young, and that ever since I can remember anything, I have loved you. I must have loved you even though I did not know it. But if you had never spoken of love to me, if you had never written that letter which I received in Brussels, <b>I</b> <b>probably</b> <b>would</b> <b>have</b> been satisfied to go on with my humdrum life to the end of time; who knows? I might have found contentment if not happiness, by and by with some other man. We women are meant to marry. Men are fond of telling us that our only mission on earth is to marry. But all this possible, quiet content one letter has dissipated. I could never be happy now, never, save in continuing to love you. Life to me would be unspeakably hideous without you and your love. Therefore, I say, Luke, that you have no longer any right to keep me at arm's length. You have no right, having once come into my life, having once given substance and vitality to my love, to withdraw yourself away from me. Love, dear, is a bond, a mutual bond, as sacred, as binding as any that are contracted on this earth. You--when you wrote that letter, when first you spoke to me of love--entered into a bond with me. You have no right to force me to break it." ...|$|E

Auerbach explains in an interview held by Horrornovelreviews.com that the reason he believes his novel was so well received from horror fans was because that idea of a stalker hunting you down is such a raw and human fear.
