5|$|Following this disaster, Sayf al-Dawla {{needed time}} to recover his strength, {{but as soon as}} Nikephoros Phokas {{returned}} victorious from Crete in summer 961, he resumed the offensive in the east. The Byzantines captured Anazarbus in Cilicia, and followed a deliberate policy of devastation and massacre to drive the Muslim population away. Sayf al-Dawla's attempts to halt the Byzantine advance in Cilicia failed, and Nikephoros Phokas, with an army reportedly 70,000 strong, took Marash, Sisium, Duluk and Manbij, securing the western passes over the Anti-Taurus Mountains. Sayf al-Dawla sent his army north under Nadja to meet the Byzantines, but Nikephoros <b>ignored</b> <b>them.</b> Instead, the Byzantine general led his troops south and in mid-December, they suddenly appeared before Aleppo. There they defeated an improvised army before the city walls. The Byzantines stormed the city and plundered it, except for the citadel, which continued to hold out. The Byzantines departed in early 963, taking much of the populace with them as captives.|$|E
5|$|In 1904 the Wrights {{built the}} Flyer II. They decided {{to avoid the}} expense of travel and {{bringing}} supplies to the Outer Banks and set up an airfield at Huffman Prairie, a cow pasture eight miles (13km) northeast of Dayton. They received {{permission to use the}} field rent-free from owner and bank president Torrance Huffman. They invited reporters to their first flight attempt of the year on May 23, on the condition that no photographs be taken. Engine troubles and slack winds prevented any flying, and they could manage only a very short hop a few days later with fewer reporters present. Library of Congress historian Fred Howard noted some speculation that the brothers may have intentionally failed to fly in order to cause reporters to lose interest in their experiments. Whether that is true is not known, but after their poor showing local newspapers virtually <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> for the next year and a half.|$|E

5|$|Mortier {{demonstrated}} his tactical prowess in {{the deployment}} of his small force: he sent all his cavalry to the north to attack the Spanish left; three battalions were sent south between the fort at San Cristóbal and the Spanish right wing; and his remaining six infantry battalions assaulted the Spanish front. As the fog rose, the French light cavalry under Briche gained the heights and fell upon the Spanish left flank, while Latour-Maubourg took three dragoon regiments to attack the combined Spanish and Portuguese cavalry on the plains of the Caya. Despite outnumbering the French, the Allied horse ignored orders and immediately fled towards Elvas and Campo Maior. They escaped unscathed, largely because Latour-Maubourg <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> and instead launched his cavalry against the Spanish infantry line.|$|E
5|$|Militarily {{weaker than}} NATO, Khrushchev wanted to install Soviet R-12 MRBM nuclear {{missiles}} on Cuba {{to even the}} power balance. Although conflicted, Castro agreed, believing it would guarantee Cuba's safety and enhance the cause of socialism. Undertaken in secrecy, only the Castro brothers, Guevara, Dorticós and security chief Ramiro Valdés knew the full plan. Upon discovering it through aerial reconnaissance, in October the U.S. implemented an island-wide quarantine to search vessels headed to Cuba, sparking the Cuban Missile Crisis. The U.S. saw the missiles as offensive; Castro insisted they were for defense only. Castro urged Khrushchev to threaten a nuclear strike on the U.S. should Cuba be attacked, but Khrushchev was desperate to avoid nuclear war. Castro was {{left out of the}} negotiations, in which Khruschev agreed to remove the missiles in exchange for a U.S. commitment not to invade Cuba and an understanding that the U.S. would remove their MRBMs from Turkey and Italy. Feeling betrayed by Khruschev, Castro was furious and soon fell ill. Proposing a five-point plan, Castro demanded that the U.S. end its embargo, withdraw from Guantanamo Bay Naval Base, cease supporting dissidents, and stop violating Cuban air space and territorial waters. Presenting these demands to U Thant, visiting Secretary-General of the United Nations, the U.S. <b>ignored</b> <b>them,</b> and in turn Castro refused to allow the U.N.'s inspection team into Cuba.|$|E

25|$|Claims to land {{under the}} new plan began to arrive immediately, but Commissioner Brisbane <b>ignored</b> <b>them,</b> hoping for another {{reversal}} of the decision in Washington.

The sale provoked outcry from freedpeople who had already claimed land according to Chase's December order.|$|E

Among the well-known works that he painted for the Moulin Rouge and other Parisian nightclubs are depictions of the singer Yvette Guilbert; the dancer Louise Weber, {{better known as the}} outrageous La Goulue (The Glutton) who created the French Can-Can; and the much more subtle dancer Jane Avril.|$|E
25|$|In 1800, {{when she}} first met them, Marshman was appalled by the neglect with {{the way in which}} William Carey looked after his four boys; aged 4, 7, 12 and 15, they were unmannered, undisciplined, and even uneducated. Carey had not spoiled, but rather simply <b>ignored</b> <b>them.</b> Marshman, her husband and their friend the printer William Ward, took the boys in tow. Together they shaped the boys as Carey pampered his botanical specimens, {{performed}} his many missionary tasks and journeyed into Calcutta to teach at Fort William College. They offered the boys structure, instruction and companionship. To their credit - and little to Carey's - all four boys went on to useful careers.|$|E
25|$|Historiography {{has played}} {{a vital role in}} {{emphasizing}} and giving the proper place due to the theme of World War I prisoners of war, though at first it <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> and they were only gradually rehabilitated. The historiography of the Great War can be divided into three phases. The first is the military and diplomatic phase. Antoine Prost and Jay Winter (2004) speak of preserving the national atmosphere. Captivity was absent from all that was written on the conflict at the time. For instance, in 1929 Jean Norton Cru published a study of writings by former combatants: “The goal of this book is to give an image of the war according to those who saw it up close”. None of the 300 collected writings was by a former prisoner of war. The second phase was social, and the third is the social-cultural phase, wherein the prisoners have retaken their place.|$|E

25|$|In {{the early}} Xianning era (275–280), Emperor Wu named Xun Xu, Shi Bao (石苞) {{and others as}} the pioneers of the Jin dynasty and {{included}} them among those honoured in the Jin dynasty's ancestral temple. Around 280, when Wang Jun requested permission to lead an army to conquer Eastern Wu (the last of the Three Kingdoms), Xun Xu and Jia Chong strongly objected but Emperor Wu <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> and ordered Wang Jun and others to lead Jin forces on an invasion of Wu. The invasion turned out successful {{and led to the}} reunification of China under the Jin dynasty. When Emperor Wu assessed Xun Xu's contributions in helping him draft imperial edicts, he rewarded Xun Xu by enfeoffing one of his sons as a village marquis with 1,000 taxable households in his marquisate and awarding him 1,000 rolls of silk. The emperor also enfeoffed Xun Xu's grandson, Xun Xian (荀顯), as the Marquis of Yingyang Village (潁陽亭侯).|$|E
25|$|Following a {{nuisance}} raid by Japanese flying boats in May, Nimitz dispatched a minesweeper {{to guard the}} intended refueling point for Operation K near French Frigate Shoals, causing the reconnaissance mission to be aborted and leaving Yamamoto ignorant of whether Pacific Fleet carriers were still at Pearl Harbor. It remains unclear why Yamamoto permitted the earlier attack, and why his submarines did not sortie sooner, as reconnaissance was essential to success at Midway. Nimitz also dispatched his carriers toward Midway early, and they passed the intended picket line force of submarines en route to their station, negating Yamamoto's back-up security measure. Nimitz's carriers positioned themselves to ambush the Kido Butai (striking force) when it struck Midway. A token cruiser and destroyer force was sent toward the Aleutians, but otherwise Nimitz <b>ignored</b> <b>them.</b> On June 4, 1942, days before Yamamoto expected them to interfere in the Midway operation, US carrier-based aircraft destroyed the four carriers of the Kido Butai, catching the Japanese carriers at an especially vulnerable moment.|$|E
25|$|Both Cameron and Mackintosh {{appeared}} before the Privy Council and agreed to be bound by its decision. Initially the Council told them to agree a sum of compensation between themselves, but when this proved impossible, the Council ordered Cameron to pay Mackintosh 72,000 merks (about £3600 in English money of the time). Mackintosh tried to leave Edinburgh in secret, but was arrested and bound to keep the peace. However, {{as soon as he}} got home, he called on the Chattan Confederation to launch an expedition into Lochaber. Some of his friends tried to dissuade him, but Mackintosh <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> and led 1500 men to the south end of Loch Lochy. Cameron assembled a force from his own clan joined by MacGregor men, a clan that had served Glencairn in 1653-4, and a small party of MacIans of Glencoe. They numbered 300 bowmen, plus 900 men armed with guns, broadswords and targe shields. They then marched for Cameron's home at Achnacarry, which is in a strategic position on the south bank of the River Arkaig, on the isthmus between Loch Arkaig and Loch Lochy.|$|E

25|$|Result: Both teams {{wanted a}} {{designer}} shopping trolley, but Kinetic won it after Lewis unwittingly sabotaged Atomic's pitch by asking irrelevant questions and behaving in an unprofessional manner. Kinetic therefore got the trolley and a handheld vacuum cleaner, while Atomic chose a pie making machine and a bird {{house with a}} built-in camera (Harry M. and Hayley wanted an inflatable support pillow, but Haya <b>ignored</b> <b>them).</b> Both teams struggled to sell {{in the first half}} of the day, and had to resort to cutting prices as the day went on. The standout performers were Harry H. and Lizzie on Kinetic, who overcame their lack of a discount with very effective product demonstrations of the vacuum cleaner, and Harry M. on Atomic, who single-handedly made almost half of his team's revenue by selling five bird boxes at the end of the day. Kinetic won out with a profit of £1,138.77, largely due to Harry H. and Lizzie's work with the vacuum cleaners, while Atomic suffered their fourth successive defeat, raising just £847.42.|$|E
25|$|Jiangling was {{initially}} situated on flat lands {{and was a}} very accessible location. However, Lu Kang later ordered Zhang Xian (張咸) to oversee {{the construction of a}} large dyke to block the river flow and direct its waters to flood the flat lands, so as to create a large body of water around the city to serve as a barrier to invaders. When Yang Hu arrived, he planned to make use of this barrier by transporting supplies on boats, but he spread false news that he intended to destroy the dyke to make way for his land army to pass through. When Lu Kang heard that, he saw through Yang Hu's plot and ordered Zhang Xian to destroy the dyke. Lu Kang's officers were shocked and attempted to dissuade him from doing so because they thought he would be doing the enemy a favour, but Lu <b>ignored</b> <b>them.</b> When Yang Hu reached Dangyang (當陽), he was dismayed to hear that the dyke had been destroyed. He {{had no choice but to}} transport his supplies on land, resulting in the wasting of time and effort.|$|E
25|$|In 264, the Wei general Zhong Hui {{started a}} {{rebellion}} against Sima Zhao after leading Wei forces to conquer Shu. At the time, Sima Zhao only heard rumours about the rebellion {{and had no}} concrete evidence yet. As he had all along treated Zhong Hui well, {{he was reluctant to}} believe that Zhong would rebel against him. After Xun Xu cautioned him against trusting Zhong Hui, Sima Zhao led his forces to garrison at Chang'an as a precautionary measure. Guo Yi (郭奕) and Wang Shen (王深) urged Sima Zhao to banish Xun Xu because they feared that he would side with Zhong Hui, given that he was raised by the Zhong family (Zhong Hui was Zhong Yao's son). However, Sima Zhao <b>ignored</b> <b>them</b> and continued to treat Xun Xu as he did before, and even allowed Xun to ride in the same carriage as him. Previously, when Sima Zhao ordered Zhong Hui to lead Wei forces to conquer Shu, Xun Xu had nominated Wei Guan to be the army supervisor. Later, Wei Guan played a huge role in suppressing Zhong Hui's rebellion. After Shu had been pacified, Xun Xu followed Sima Zhao back to the Wei capital, Luoyang, where he, Pei Xiu and Yang Hu were put in charge of the privy council.|$|E
