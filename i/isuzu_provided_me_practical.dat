40|$|For {{over four}} decades, segregation, as the master {{narrative}} in South Africa, favoured {{the development of}} whites as mental health workers and empowered them to research and write {{about the lives of}} people of colour, thus becoming the experts on their lives. In this project I do something in reverse by being an Indian pastoral therapist to white counsellees. The project describes a postmodern narrative approach and social construction epistemology and the application of these towards culturally sensitive and respectful ways of doing pastoral therapy. Important feedback from white counsellees on race, culture and spirituality enabled me to reflect on culturally sensitive ways of doing pastoral therapy in a multicultural post Apartheid South Africa.

40|$|Graduate {{studies for}} me {{were more than}} just a career change. The ability {{to take the time to}} reflect upon a problem and begin to see what others have done before me {{required}} time to acquire. Going from what I could do to what can be done requires a different mindset, but offers greater rewards and more elaborate opportunities. My industrial experience <b>provided</b> <b>me</b> with good <b>practical</b> skills before I decided to pursue graduate studies. My academic experience showed me countless ways to approach a problem and gave me appreciation for how much has been done before and how many very talented people have solved so many problems. It also showed me that by taking the risk to try fundamentally different approaches, even if they appeared to be very difficult, turned out to be the most profitable experiences. I would like to express my gratitude towards my supervisor Professor Zeljko Zilic for his guidance, trust and patience through all the years I spent in the In-tegrated Microsystems Laboratory, first towards the completion of my Masters of Engineering and now for this doctoral thesis. His constant support and under-standing made a great difference and by far exceeded all my expectations of what a supervisor can provide to his students. I want to highlight the help of my good friend and colleague Stephan Bourduas for our collaboration on Network-on-Chip development, our many co-authored publications, and more recently for his insight on the verification methodology used at his work for the largest microprocessor company in the world. Marc Boule was also a key player in the work presented. His inspiring work on the MBAC hardware assertion compiler provided the foundation for many of the ideas pre-iii sented in this thesis. Through our many co-authored publications I was able to appreciate his astute mathematical abilities and enjoyed discussing and debating with him about our proposed debug methodologies...|$|R
