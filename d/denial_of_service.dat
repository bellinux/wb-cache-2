In MANET each node are self capable that support routing functionality {{in an ad}} hoc scenario, forwarding of data or exchange of topology information using wireless communications. These characteristic specifies a better scalability of network. But this advantage leads to the scope of security compromising.

25|$|NTP {{has been}} used in {{distributed}} <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> (DDoS) attacks. A small query is sent to an NTP server with the return address spoofed to be the target address. Similar to the DNS amplification attack, the server responds with a much larger reply that allows an attacker to substantially increase the amount of data being sent to the target. To avoid participating in an attack, servers can be configured to ignore external queries, or they can be upgraded to version 4.2.7p26 or later.|$|E

25|$|Several {{security}} concerns arose in late 2014. Previously, researchers {{became aware that}} NTP servers can be susceptible to man-in-the-middle attacks unless packets are cryptographically signed for authentication. The computational overhead involved can make this impractical on busy servers, particularly during <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attacks. NTP message spoofing {{can be used to}} move clocks on client computers and allow a number of attacks based on bypassing of cryptographic key expiration. Some of the services impacted by fake NTP messages identified are TLS, DNSSEC, various caching schemes (such as DNS cache), BGP, Bitcoin and a number of persistent login schemes.|$|E
25|$|An {{application}} layer DDoS attack is done mainly for specific targeted purposes, including disrupting transactions {{and access to}} databases. It requires less resources and often accompanies network layer attacks. An attack is disguised to look like legitimate traffic, except it targets specific application packets. The attack on the {{application layer}} can disrupt services such as the retrieval of information or search function as well as web browser function, email services and photo applications. In order to be deemed a distributed <b>denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>service</b> attack, more than around 3–5 nodes on different networks should be used; using fewer than 3–5 nodes qualifies as a Denial-of-service attack and not a DDoS.|$|E
25|$|Manipulation of the buffer, {{which occurs}} {{before it is}} read or executed, {{may lead to the}} failure of an {{exploitation}} attempt. These manipulations can mitigate the threat of exploitation, but may not make it impossible. Manipulations could include conversion to upper or lower case, removal of metacharacters and filtering out of non-alphanumeric strings. However, techniques exist to bypass these filters and manipulations; alphanumeric code, polymorphic code, self-modifying code and return-to-libc attacks. The same methods can be used to avoid detection by intrusion detection systems. In some cases, including where code is converted into unicode, the threat of the vulnerability has been misrepresented by the disclosers as only <b>Denial</b> <b>of</b> <b>Service</b> when in fact the remote execution of arbitrary code is possible.|$|E
