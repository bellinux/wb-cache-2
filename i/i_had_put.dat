500|$|The sole Kenyan athlete at the Games, Philip Boit, {{competed in}} the men's 10 {{kilometre}} classical cross-country skiing. The competition took place on 12 February, at the Snow Harp venue in Hakuba, Nagano. The beginning of the race was chaotic, with the skiers beset by heavy rain. Boit {{was not prepared to}} race on wet snow, and later attributed it as the reason for falling down on several occasions. He found that it added further complications, adding [...] "Going uphill, the skis were collecting snow. It was like <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> on high heeled-shoes!" ...|$|E
500|$|The first {{instalment}} of Tintin in the Land of the Soviets {{appeared in the}} 10 January 1929 edition of , and ran weekly until 8 May 1930. Hergé did not plot out the storyline in advance; he improvised new situations on a weekly basis, leaving Jean-Marc and Randy Lofficier to observe that both [...] "Story-wise and graphically, Hergé was learning his craft before our eyes." [...] Hergé admitted that the work was rushed, saying, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I {{was going to get}} Tintin out of the predicament <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> him in the previous week." [...] Michael Farr considered this evident, remarking that many drawings were [...] "crude, rudimentary, [...] rushed", lacking the [...] "polish and refinement" [...] that Hergé would later develop. Contrastingly, he thought that certain plates were of the [...] "highest quality" [...] and exhibited Hergé's [...] "outstanding ability as a draughtsman".|$|E
500|$|Tintin in the Congo was serialised {{under the}} French title of Tintin au Congo in Le Petit Vingtième from 5 May 1930 to 11 June 1931; it was {{syndicated}} to the French Catholic newspaper Cœurs Vaillants. Drawn {{in black and}} white, it followed the same formula employed in Land of the Soviets, remaining [...] "essentially plotless" [...] according to Michael Farr, and consisting of largely unrelated events that Hergé improvised each week. Hergé later commented {{on the process of}} writing these early adventures, stating, [...] "The [...] came out on Wednesday evening, and I often didn't have a clue on Wednesday morning how I was going to get Tintin out of the predicament <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> him in the previous week." [...] The strip's visual style was similar to that of Land of the Soviets. In the first instalment of Tintin in the Congo, Hergé featured Quick and Flupke, two young boys from Brussels whom he had recently introduced in another Le Petit Vingtième comic strip, in the crowd of people saying goodbye to Tintin.|$|E

Harkins, {{head of the}} US {{military}} mission to Vietnam, Diệm joked: [...] "I shouldn't have {{put him in the}} air force, because <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> his father in jail years ago". Diệm went on to predict that [...] "sometime I'm going to get shot right {{in the back of the}} neck. Sometime they'll get me that way". (He and Nhu were deposed and shot dead during the November 1963 coup.) Diệm reacted to the assassination attempt by cracking down on political dissidents and further tightening control of the press. Off the record, one official admitted that [...] "e don't even talk about freedom of the press or ask for other liberties any more... had completely surrounded himself in a protective oligarchy". Nhu justified further anti-opposition restrictions, remarking that [...] "here's always going to be an opposition. If we take these people in, there will be another opposition springing up, because they are controversial men." [...] Madame Nhu added, [...] "ou open a window to let in light and air, not bullets. We want freedom, but we don't want to be exploited by it." ...|$|E

[...] "The venture was mine, and <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>put</b> every dollar I possessed into the purchase. All week long I wrote wildly to meet the payroll and contractor costs."

[...] On 8 October Darwin wrote telling Lyell that the review was [...] "far from popular with non-scientific readers.

A week later, Suzuki released her second studio album, Infinity Eighteen Vol. 1, which sold 1,063,000 copies and debuted at number one.　Suzuki has said {{of this first}} period of her career {{that she was not}} free to do what she wanted and only followed what she was told, leaving her feeling [...] "pretty disheartened and down, like there was no future.".
