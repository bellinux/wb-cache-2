5|$|A snail {{does not}} have a dart to fire the very first time it mates, because the first mating is {{necessary}} to trigger the process of dart formation. Once a snail has mated, it fires a dart before some, but not all, subsequent matings. A snail often mates without having a dart to use, because <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> to create a replacement dart. In the case of the garden snail Cornu aspersum, it takes a week for a new dart to form.|$|E

25|$|The usual {{intravenous}} dose is 10–20 mEq {{per hour and}} it is given slowly since <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for the electrolyte to equilibrate into the cells. When used in state-sanctioned lethal injection, bolus potassium injection affects the electrical conduction of heart muscle. Elevated potassium, or hyperkalemia, causes the resting electrical potential of the heart muscle cells to be lower than normal (less negative). Without this negative resting potential, cardiac cells cannot repolarize (prepare for their next contraction).|$|E

25|$|Sometimes {{it is of}} {{interest}} {{to find out what}} is the immediate effect of a perturbation or knockout, since <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for regulatory changes to occur and for the organism to re-organize fluxes to optimally utilize a different carbon source or circumvent the effect of the knockout. MOMA predicts the immediate sub-optimal flux distribution following the perturbation by minimizing the distance (Euclidean) between the wild-type FBA flux distribution and the mutant flux distribution using quadratic programming. This yields an optimization problem of the form.|$|E
25|$|The {{pilgrimage to}} Mecca is less costly and arduous for the Sudanese {{than it is}} for many Muslims. Nevertheless, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> (or money if travel is by air), and the {{ordinary}} Sudanese Muslim has generally found it difficult to accomplish, rarely undertaking it before middle age. Some have joined pilgrimage societies into which members pay a small amount monthly and choose one of their number when sufficient funds have accumulated to send someone on the pilgrimage. A returned pilgrim is entitled to use the honorific title hajj or hajjih for a woman.|$|E
25|$|People with {{moderately}} {{pigmented skin}} (Types III-IV) {{are able to}} produce melanin in their skin in response to UVR. Normal tanning is usually delayed as <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for the melanins to move up in the epidermis. Heavy tanning does not approach the photoprotective effect against UVR-induced DNA damage compared to naturally occurring dark skin, however it offers great protection against seasonal variations in UVR. Gradually developed tan in the spring prevents sunburns in the summer. This mechanism is almost certainly the evolutionary reason behind the development of tanning behaviour.|$|E

25|$|Amylases {{are used}} in {{breadmaking}} and to break down complex sugars, such as starch (found in flour), into simple sugars. Yeast then feeds on these simple sugars and converts it into the waste products of alcohol and CO2. This imparts flavour and causes the bread to rise. While amylases are found naturally in yeast cells, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for the yeast to produce enough of these enzymes to break down significant quantities of starch in the bread. This {{is the reason for}} long fermented doughs such as sour dough. Modern breadmaking techniques have included amylases (often in the form of malted barley) into bread improver, thereby making the process faster and more practical for commercial use.|$|E
25|$|As of 2008, {{blogging}} {{had become}} such a mania that a new blog was created every second of every minute of every hour of every day. Researchers have actively analyzed the dynamics of how blogs become popular. There are essentially two measures of this: popularity through citations, as well as popularity through affiliation (i.e., blogroll). The basic conclusion from studies {{of the structure of}} blogs is that while <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for a blog to become popular through blogrolls, permalinks can boost popularity more quickly, and are perhaps more indicative of popularity and authority than blogrolls, since they denote that people are actually reading the blog's content and deem it valuable or noteworthy in specific cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{average time}} to death once a lethal {{injection}} protocol has been started is about 7 to 11 minutes. Since {{it only takes}} about 30 seconds for the thiopental to induce anesthesia, 30–45 seconds for the pancuronium to cause paralysis, and about 30 seconds for the potassium to stop the heart, death can theoretically be attained {{in as little as}} 90 seconds. Given that <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> to administer the drug, time for the line to flush itself, time for the change of the drug being administered, and time to ensure that death has occurred, the whole procedure takes about 7–11 minutes. Procedural aspects in pronouncing death also contribute to delay, so the condemned is usually pronounced dead within 10 to 20 minutes of starting the drugs. Supporters of the death penalty say that a huge dose of thiopental, which is between 14 and 20 times the anesthetic induction dose and which has the potential to induce a medical coma lasting 60 hours, could never wear off in only 10 to 20 minutes.|$|E
25|$|All viperids have {{a pair of}} {{relatively}} long solenoglyphous (hollow) fangs {{that are used to}} inject venom from glands located towards the rear of the upper jaws, just behind the eyes. Each of the two fangs is {{at the front of the}} mouth on a short maxillary bone that can rotate back and forth. When not in use, the fangs fold back against the roof of the mouth and are enclosed in a membranous sheath. The left and right fangs can be rotated together or independently. During a strike, the mouth can open nearly 180° and the maxilla rotates forward, erecting the fangs as late as possible so that the fangs do not become damaged, as they are brittle. The jaws close upon impact and the muscular sheaths encapsulating the venom glands contract, injecting the venom as the fangs penetrate the target. This action is very fast; in defensive strikes, it will be more a stab than a bite. Viperids use this mechanism primarily for immobilization and digestion of prey. Secondarily, it is used for self-defence, though in cases with nonprey, such as humans, they may give a dry bite (not inject any venom). A dry bite allows the snake to conserve their precious reserve of venom, because once it has been depleted, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> to replenish, leaving the snake vulnerable.|$|E

500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Final Fantasy VIII, Squall {{is known as a}} [...] "lone wolf" [...] because he never shows his feelings and seems cold to his associates. His superiors (such as teacher Quistis Trepe) consider him difficult to deal with, but respect his talents. Squall is stoic, with his taciturn nature used for comic relief. He is dragged into a heroic role when Cid, headmaster of Balamb Garden, appoints him leader of the academy midway through the game. During a late battle against Galbadia Garden, Squall has difficulty exhibiting leadership because of his lingering isolation. Although other characters try to pull him out of his shell and Rinoa Heartilly expends considerable energy pursuing him, <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for him to accept the others' friendship, fall in love with Rinoa and care for her. Squall is more comfortable later in a leadership role, especially when he must fight Ultimecia.|$|E
500|$|Its treble panel {{diaphragm}} {{is further}} subdivided into midrange and tweeter sections, achieved by clamping it {{on each side}} of its centre. Both midrange and tweeter sections are driven separately, and the entire treble unit operates at substantially lower voltages – operating voltages are said to be 6000V for the bass and 1500V for the treble. The speaker needs to be plugged into the mains and must be charged prior to use. This is because the diaphragm operates in a [...] "constant charge" [...] mode, and <b>it</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for the charge to build up. In practice, the speaker is usable after charging for less than half a minute, but the sound gradually improves as the charge builds up. Best performance is achieved when the speaker has charged fully, which can take up to an hour. The electricity is only to charge the diaphragm, so consumption is negligible.|$|E
500|$|There {{are three}} types of {{foraging}} behaviour observed in the common starling. [...] "Probing" [...] involves the bird plunging its beak into the ground randomly and repetitively until an insect has been found, and is often accompanied by bill gaping where the bird opens its beak in the soil to enlarge a hole. This behaviour, first described by Konrad Lorenz and given the German term zirkeln, {{is also used to}} create and widen holes in plastic garbage bags. <b>It</b> <b>takes</b> <b>time</b> for young common starlings to perfect this technique, and because of this the diet of young birds will often contain fewer insects. [...] "Hawking" [...] is the capture of flying insects directly from the air, and [...] "lunging" [...] is the less common technique of striking forward to catch a moving invertebrate on the ground. Earthworms are caught by pulling from soil. Common starlings that have periods without access to food, or have a reduction in the hours of light available for feeding, compensate by increasing their body mass by the deposition of fat.|$|E
