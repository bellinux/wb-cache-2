Tovey's nephew auditioned for the part of a younger Henry, but another child actor was cast for the role as the nephew was considered too young.|$|E

Hoppus {{was interested in}} {{being a part of}} the record, but DeLonge did not want it to turn into a Blink-182 album. DeLonge contended that the involvement of Barker was to refrain from having to pay a session musician. Regardless, Hoppus felt betrayed and unresolved tension dogged the band until their 2005 breakup. [...] "Nobody talked about it.

Barker felt guilty when he told Hoppus they were going to tour in support of the album: [...] "I <b>felt</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> <b>had</b> let him down [...] but he was ultimately more upset at Tom because they had ten years of history together before me." [...] Despite this tension, Hoppus lent vocals to the track [...] "Elevator" [...] and shared early ideas for the next Blink-182 album. In a later Reddit AMA, Hoppus concluded, [...] "The whole situation sucked. But I sang on the track because, at the heart of it, Tom and Travis are my friends.
