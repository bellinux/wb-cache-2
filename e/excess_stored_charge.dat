50|$|The {{function}} of this capacitor, {{known as a}} reservoir capacitor (or smoothing capacitor) is to lessen the variation in (or 'smooth') the rectified AC output voltage waveform from the bridge. There is still some variation, known as ripple. One explanation of 'smoothing' is that the capacitor provides {{a low impedance path}} to the AC component of the output, reducing the AC voltage across, and AC current through, the resistive load. In less technical terms, any drop in the output voltage and current of the bridge tends to be cancelled by loss of charge in the capacitor. This charge flows out as additional current through the load. Thus the change of load current and voltage is reduced relative to what would occur without the capacitor. Increases of voltage correspondingly <b>store</b> <b>excess</b> <b>charge</b> in the capacitor, thus moderating the change in output voltage / current.|$|R

The method {{involves the use of}} a pulse current source to anodise aluminium layers instead of the typically used constant current/voltage source, with the test structures experiencing positive and negative cycles periodically. By tuning the positive cycle percentage, it is demonstrated that the effective <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> can be manipulated in a range from - 5. 2 × 1011 to 2. 5 × 1012 q/cm 2 when the AAO is formed over a thin silicon dioxide layer. Photoconductance decay measurements on symmetrical n-type test structures with ∼ 150 Ω/□ boron-diffused surfaces were used to estimate the recombination current density associated with the diffused surface (Jop+), which was then correlated to the <b>stored</b> <b>charge.</b> As the effective <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> changed from positive towards negative values, the Jop+ was reduced from 210 fA/cm 2 to 100 fA/cm 2.

40|$|Power {{devices such}} as IGBTs (Insulated Gate Bipolar Transistors) operate within a large {{temperature}} range. Therefore, {{it is really important}} to understand the relationship between the device temperature and its electrical characteristics. From this viewpoint, the authors have studied the influence of the IGBT technology (Punch-Through PT or Non-Punch-Through NPT) on its thermal and electrical behaviours. This work points out that the variations with temperature of the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> in the IGBT base depend on the device technology. Using two-dimensional device simulations coupled with an analytical modelling, the authors show that the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> in PT devices is more temperature sensitive than in NPT devices. The modelling of the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> function of the current density and the device description proves that the concept of the charge injection control influences the temperature dependence.

50|$|Baker clamp is {{a generic}} {{name for a}} class of {{electronic}} circuits that reduce the storage time of a switching bipolar junction transistor (BJT) by applying a nonlinear negative feedback through various kinds of diodes. The reason for slow turn-off times of saturated BJTs is the <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> in the base.

Because the transistor went less deeply into saturation, the transistor accumulated fewer <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> carriers. Therefore, less time was required to clear <b>stored</b> <b>charge</b> during transistor turn off. A low-voltage diode arranged to prevent saturation of the transistor was applied to integrated logic families by using Schottky diodes, as in Schottky TTL.|$|R
