The basic design premise of the scheme is that any frequency drop in response to credible and non-credible contingency events should be limited to 47 Hz by the <b>controlled</b> <b>disconnection</b> of load through frequency sensing relays. UFLS operates only during rare events, usually following a non-credible contingency, where a drop-in frequency has not been arrested by FCAS.

Preventing overloads and blackouts is also among the goals of domotic systems like (Tecdomotica 2012), which support the <b>controlled</b> <b>disconnection</b> of appliances – in some cases, including static priorities, in others, like (Tecdomotica 2012), controlling UPS units and emergency lights, as well as light control based on environmental conditions. Energy saving and cost control are also among the main objectives of (Futursoft 2012), which operates by controlling the on/off times of “isles” of appliances based on the user configuration. The idea of constantly controlling the energy absorption is further developed in (EyeOn 2012), which considers appliances’ priorities in deciding the loads to exclude and re-activate to prevent blackouts.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a model-based fault detection algorithm {{for a specific}} fault scenario of the ADDSAFE project. The fault considered is the <b>disconnection</b> of a <b>control</b> surface from its hydraulic actuator. Detecting this type of fault {{as fast as possible}} helps to operate an aircraft more cost effective and can help to avoid an undetected increase in fuel consumption. The method proposed here uses an Adaptive Extended Kalman Filter (A-EKF) to detect the disconnection using only local measurements (control signal to the actuator and actuator rod position). For this purpose, an accurate physical model of the hydraulic actuator is needed and the fault is detected by parameter estimation. It is shown that the A-EKF performs better than the regular Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) for this application. Control & OperationsAerospace Engineerin...|$|R

Special attention {{is given to the}} challenge of maintaining system stability and security of supply in the presence of distributed and fluctuating renewable power generation and the integration of electro-mobility into the distribution grid. The proposed remedies, tailored for integration into future “smart grid ” communication and control structures, consist of introducing controlled islanding schemes for interconnected transmission grids, highly distributed under-frequency load shedding mechanisms on the customer level, and <b>controlled</b> <b>disconnection</b> of electric vehicles in case of a distribution grid overloading.

40|$|Research in the {{concurrency}} control of real-time data access over mobile networks is receiving growing attention. With possibly lengthy transmission delay and frequent <b>disconnection,</b> traditional concurrency <b>control</b> mechanisms may become very costly and time-consuming in mobile distributed database systems (MDRTDBS). Due to limited bandwidth and unpredictable behavior of mobile networks, the past research on {{concurrency control}} for distributed real-time database systems (DRTDBS) {{can not be}} directly applied to MDRTDBS. In this paper, we propose a distributed real-time locking protocol, called SDHP- 2 PL, based on the High Priority Two Phase Locking (HP- 2 PL) scheme {{and the concept of}} similarity for MDRTDBS. We consider the characteristics of mobile networks and adopt the concept of similarity to reduce the possibility of lock conflicts.

Carrier proteins are recognized both in cis and in trans by partner catalytic domains that effect chain-elongating condensations, redox adjustments, other tailoring steps, and finally kinetically <b>controlled</b> <b>disconnection</b> and {{release of the}} mature natural product. Dissection of regions of carrier proteins that are specifically recognized by upstream and downstream catalytic partner proteins is deciphering the logic for multiprotein assembly line construction of these large classes of natural products. The fatty acyl chains in primary metabolites, and the scaffolds of thousands of polyketide (PK) 1 and nonribosomal peptide (NRP) secondary metabolites are assembled by elongation of {{a small number of}} carboxylic acid building blocks (1 - 5).

The connector includes plug and receptacle components. The plug has a central pin surrounded by a plurality of lamellae. The lamellae have an end connected to the base and a free end.

40|$|Applications {{based on}} groups of self-organized mobile robots and - more generically - agents are {{becoming}} pervasive in communication, monitoring, traffic and transportation systems. Their advantage {{is the possibility}} of providing services without the existence of a previously defined infrastructure and {{with a high degree of}} autonomy. On the other hand, physical agents, in general, are prone to failures, adding uncertainty and unpredictability in the environments in which they operate. Therefore, a robust topology regarding failures is an imperative requirement. In this paper, we show that mechanisms based solely on connectivity maintenance are not enough to obtain a sufficiently resilient network, and a robustness-oriented approach is necessary. Thus, we propose a local combined control law that aims at maintaining the overall network connectivity while improving the network robustness via actions that reduce vulnerability to failures that might lead to network <b>disconnection.</b> The combined <b>control</b> law performance was validated from two perspectives: as a reactive and as a proactive mechanism. As a reactive mechanism, it was able to accommodate ongoing failures and postpone or avoid network fragmentation. As a proactive mechanism, the network topology was able to evolve from a potentially vulnerable topology w. r. t. failures to a more robust one...|$|R
40|$|Many adults {{complain}} that domestic products of today {{are more difficult}} to use than earlier products. Learning problems may have arisen because of (1) the increasing complexity of interfaces over the past years or (2) age-related cognitive changes. The organization of objects on an interface {{plays a key role in}} the user's understanding and recall of executable sequences of actions. Up until the eighties, objects on domestic products were organized in the breadth (single-layer). Later, a large expansion offunctionality on appliances made it infeasible to organize all objects on the same layer. Now objects are organized in depth (multi-layered) to hide less relevant functionality. Disadvantages of this solution are the reduction of status feedback on the device and the visual <b>disconnection</b> between a <b>control</b> and its function. Therefore, it can be assumed that it is easier to learn to use a device composed of a singlelayer interface than one composed of a multi-layered interface. It is assumed that older adults encounter even more difficulties than younger adults with multi-layered interfaces, due to age-related inefficiency of information processing and encoding. The learning behaviour of three age-groups was compared using a simulation of a single-layer and a two-layered videophone interface, with a counterbalanced block design. Younger people were found to encounter fewer interaction problems than older persons, and each of the three age-groups showed different learning progress. In general, the single-layer interface was found to be easier to use than the two-layered interface...|$|R
30|$|The {{starting}} point {{of this paper is}} that there is much more about energy management, and home management in general, than energy saving. One first aspect is that in several countries home energy meters also enforce a power threshold, forcing disconnection if the consumed power exceeds the contract limitb: this might cause several problems, from computer data loss if disconnection occurs unexpectedly, to frozen food rotting if the disconnection occurs when nobody is at home and persists for some hours, to more critical situations if the blackout occurs at night (difficulties in reaching the control panel, often positioned at the building basement, to reset the meter) or involves children (risk of fear or unexpected behaviour in the dark) or elderly people (risk of falling, running up against something, etc.). To face these aspects, energy monitoring is a necessary brick, since no prevention can be made without awareness (Enel 2012) (Energy@Home 2012); but basing prevention only on the users’ awareness of a potentially dangerous situation is clearly insufficient, as recognised by some domotic systems (e.g. (Tecdomotica 2012)) that allow the <b>controlled</b> <b>disconnection</b> of appliances to prevent overloads and blackouts. Although some systems also support priorities, the list of appliances to be disconnected in case of need is mostly pre-determined, or they are selected from a pre-determined list. Further approaches, are more focused on Web-based control and tele-diagnostics, enabling users to access and control each appliance remotely, again including alarms if pre-determined critical situations occur.|$|R
40|$|Technological {{advances}} of VLSI and wireless {{communication in the}} 90 's have been reshaping the existing form of network computing in the Internet into {{what is known as}} "Wireless Mobile Computing?. Host mobility and wireless access are two newly introduced design considerations which pose challenging problems at all layers of the networking protocol stack in the Internet. This thesis investigates their impacts on the designs of the link and transport layer protocols, particularly focusing on the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). At the transport layer, flow and congestion control are the most important problems. Although MobileIP at the network layer provides continuous network connectivity to mobile hosts, it cannot shield the effects due to host movement and wireless medium characteristics (noisy, long and varying latencies) from the TCP protocol at the transport layer. Mismatches between wired and wireless access thus cause severe performance degradation to TCP whose congestion control mechanisms are optimized for wired networks with stationary hosts. This thesis makes observations on the effects of noisy channels and temporary <b>disconnections</b> on the <b>control</b> mechanisms in a particular version of TCP, 4. 3 BSD TCP-Reno. Three phenomena, namely false congestion control trigger, multiple corruptions in a single window, and corruptions of retransmissions, are found to be the main causes of TCP through-put degradation in noisy medium. Based on these observations, an analytical methodology is developed to evaluate the throughput performance of TCP over noisy channels and to study the influences of the parameter such as fast retransmit threshold. Making use of a proposed negative acknowledgment implemented in the TCP option, this thesis proposes a scheme called NACK which has simple modifications to the congestion control mechanisms of TCP to improve its end-to-end performance with respect to the noisy channels. Two other designs based on an existing proposal, Last-Hop-ACKnowledgment (LHACK), are also proposed to provide better improvement compared with LHACK. To avoid throughput degradation due to bulk losses and the subsequent long pauses in communication during handoff, this thesis proposes buffering at the radio interfaces (BUFFER+FREEZE) and the use of probing (PROBE) to achieve better end-to-end TCP throughput. Although modifications at the transport layer are sufficient to improve the end-to-end performance of individual TCP session, packet retransmissions triggered by corruptions are wasteful to the scarce resource of wireless channels. Exploiting the phenomenon that fading characteristics of different channels are independent and location-dependent, this thesis proposes and investigates a number of scheduling algorithms at the MAC (Medium Access Control) layer of the radio interfaces which take the wireless channel status into account to defer packet transmissions to a destination in fade and use the corresponding resource to transmit packets whose destinations have good channels. It is found to have improvements in the aggregate throughput and channel utilization. Fairness issue is also studied in this thesis...|$|R
