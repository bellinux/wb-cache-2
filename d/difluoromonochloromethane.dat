5000|$|Chlorodifluoromethane or <b>difluoromonochloromethane</b> is a {{hydrochlorofluorocarbon}} (HCFC). This colorless gas {{is better}} known as HCFC-22, or R-22. It is commonly used as a propellant and refrigerant. These applications are being phased out in developed countries due to the compound's ozone depletion potential (ODP) and high global warming potential (GWP), although global use of R-22 continues to increase because of high demand in developing countries. [...] R-22 is a versatile intermediate in industrial organofluorine chemistry, e.g. as a precursor to tetrafluoroethylene. R-22 cylinders are colored light green.|$|E
