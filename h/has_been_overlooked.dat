5|$|Hoffman {{was held}} in high regard within the film and theater industry, and cited in the media {{as one of the}} finest actors of his generation.

5|$|Strange Days was a {{commercial}} failure and almost derailed Bigelow's career, making {{little more than}} a sixth of its $42 million production cost. Upon release, the film polarized film critics; some reviewers praised its gritty atmosphere and the performances by Fiennes and Bassett, while others criticized it for failing to comment on its violence. Nevertheless, the film's critical standing has improved over the years, with many fans feeling that the film <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. At the 22nd Saturn Awards, Bassett won Best Actress and Bigelow became the first woman to win the Best Director award.|$|E
5|$|The {{album was}} {{something}} of a stopgap for the band, who had already started work on The Dark Side of the Moon, and was recorded in two sessions in France between touring, with three days for mixing. The original plan was to just record small sections of music, but they ultimately created enough songs for a complete album. The resulting work <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> in the Pink Floyd canon because of the huge commercial success of later albums, but still has a positive reaction from fans and critics.|$|E

5|$|The known {{range of}} Boletopsis nothofagi {{is limited to}} two {{narrowly}} defined areas of New Zealand, one on the North Island {{and the other on}} the South Island. These areas are in Rimutaka Forest Park near Wellington, and Saint Arnaud {{in the northern part of}} the South Island. These locations are relatively far away from each other and isolated, which, together with its absence in the rest of New Zealand, makes it unlikely that the species is a recent import. It is more likely that the species is native to New Zealand and <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> in earlier surveys due to its rarity.|$|E
5|$|Pierce, so far, <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> for {{election}} to the National Baseball Hall of Fame. However, in October 2014 he was selected {{for the first time}} by the Baseball Writers' Association of America's (BBWAA) overview committee to be one of ten candidates on the Golden Era Committee ballot for possible induction in 2015. He and the other candidates, including former White Sox teammate Minnie Miñoso, all fell short of selection. The committee meets and votes on ten candidates selected from the 1947 to 1972 era every three years. Pierce received less than 4 votes of the required 12 votes from the committee at the MLB winter meeting on December 8, with no one elected to the Hall by the committee. Ron Santo received 15 votes at the committee's previous election, prior to his 2012 enshrinement.|$|E

25|$|Due to the {{increasing}} complexity of information and specialization of scientists, most of the cutting-edge research today is done by well-funded groups of scientists, rather than individuals. D.K. Simonton notes that due to the breadth of very precise and far reaching tools already used by researchers today {{and the amount of}} research generated so far, creation of new disciplines or revolutions within a discipline may no longer be possible as it is unlikely that some phenomenon that merits its own discipline <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked.</b> Hybridizing of disciplines and finessing knowledge is, in his view, the future of science.|$|E
25|$|All {{the qualities}} of CO in the list above, except the first three, are also possessed by SS2PL, which is a special case of CO, but {{blocking}} and constraining. This partially explains the popularity of SS2PL as a solution (practically, the only solution, for many years) for achieving global serializability. However, property 9 above, automatic resolution of global deadlocks, has not been noticed for SS2PL in the database research literature until today (2009; except in the CO publications). This, since the phenomenon of voting-deadlocks in such environments and their automatic resolution by the atomic commitment protocol <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked.</b>|$|E

25|$|Another {{theory of}} {{creative}} {{people is the}} investment theory of creativity. This approach {{suggest that there are}} many individual and environmental factors that must exist in precise ways for extremely high levels of creativity opposed to average levels of creativity. In the investment sense, a person with their particular characteristics in their particular environment may see an opportunity to devote their time and energy into something that <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> by others. The creative person develops an undervalued or under-recognised idea {{to the point that it}} is established as a new and creative idea. Just like in the financial world, some investments are worth the buy in, while others are less productive and do not build to the extent that the investor expected. This investment theory of creativity views creativity in a unique perspective compared to others, by asserting that creativity might rely to some extent on the right investment of effort being added to a field at the right time in the right way.|$|E
25|$|Foster, who {{is known}} by the Essex fans as Fozzy, is often {{regarded}} as the best wicket keeper in the game. In July 2011 Alec Stewart described him as the best pure wicket-keeper in the world. This {{is a fact that}} is underlined by his ability {{to stand up to the}} stumps to many quick bowlers with consistency and excellence, and for his athleticism standing back. However, he <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> by England selectors as a possible result of perceived mediocre batting, with Matt Prior, Steven Davies and Jos Buttler being preferred. Foster's batting is reliant on cuts, pulls and sweeps. In all forms of cricket, Foster uses the reverse sweep effectively. Foster usually bats at seven for Essex in all forms. He once hit 5 sixes off of the first five balls of a Scott Borthwick over vs Durham in a Pro40, but missed out on the elusive sixth when Borthwick bowled a leg-side wide.|$|E

500|$|Retrospectively, the film's {{critical}} standing has improved. Roger Ebert's correspondent Michael Mirasol {{felt that}} Strange Days had some obvious weaknesses, including a dialogue {{that is too}} polished for its setting, but nevertheless judged its [...] "devotion to its characters, its remarkable use of POVs to create its consistent atmosphere of apprehension and excitement, and most of all, its fearlessness." [...] In 2009, Drew Morton of the Pajiba website considered Strange Days an [...] "extremely underappreciated film" [...] and [...] "the best piece of cyberpunk to grace celluloid since Ridley Scott's Blade Runner." [...] Strange Days also garnered a small cult following, who felt that the film <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> by a casual mass audience and misguided critics. Overall, the film has a 63% [...] "fresh" [...] rating from 41 critics on the review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes.|$|E
500|$|Frusciante's guitar playing employs {{emphasis}} on appropriate melody, tone, and structure rather than virtuosity. Although virtuoso influences {{can be heard}} throughout his career, {{he has said that}} he often minimizes this. He feels that in general, guitar mastery has not evolved much since the 1960s and considers the greatest players of that decade unsurpassed. When he was growing up in the 1980s, many mainstream guitarists focused on speed. Because of this, he thinks that the skills of many defiant new wave and punk guitarists were largely overlooked. Therefore, he accentuates the melodically-driven technique of players such as Matthew Ashman of Bow Wow Wow and Bernard Sumner of Joy Division as much as possible because he thinks that their style <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked</b> and consequently underexplored. Despite this, he considers himself a fan of technique-driven guitarists like Randy Rhoads and Steve Vai, but represses an urge to emulate their style: [...] "People believe that by playing faster and creating new playing techniques you can progress forward, but then they realize that emotionally they don't progress at all. They transmit nothing to the people listening and they stay at where Hendrix was three decades ago. Something like that happened to Vai in the 80s." [...] Believing that focusing only on [...] "clean tones" [...] is negative, Frusciante developed an interest in playing with what he calls a [...] "grimy" [...] sound. As a result, he considers it beneficial to [...] "mistreat" [...] his guitar and employ various forms of distortion when soloing. He also tries to break as many [...] "stylistic boundaries" [...] as he can to expand his musical horizons. He thinks that much of the output from today's guitarists is unoriginal, and that many of his contemporaries [...] "follow the rules with no risk".|$|E
2500|$|From {{the very}} {{beginning}} of the early Christian church, women were important members of the movement, although some complain that much of the information in the New Testament on the work of women <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>overlooked.</b> Some also argue that many assumed that it had been a [...] "man's church" [...] because sources of information stemming from the New Testament church were written and interpreted by men. Recently, scholars have begun looking in mosaics, frescoes, and inscriptions of that period for information about women's roles in the early church.|$|E
