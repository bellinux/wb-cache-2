40|$|Statement of Problem: The use of dentine bondings on enamel and dentin {{in total}} etch {{protocols}} has recently become popular. Unfilled resin is hydrophobic and dentin bonding is hydrophilic in nature. This chemical difference could {{be effective in}} <b>enamel</b> bonding <b>process.</b> Purpose: The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the shear bond strength of unfilled resin to <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> and dentin bonding to <b>dry</b> and moist <b>enamel.</b> Materials and Methods: In this experimental study, a total of 30 incisor teeth were used. The specimens were randomly assigned to three groups of 10. 37 % phosphoric acid etchant was applied to the enamel surfaces in each group for 15 seconds, rinsed with water for 20 seconds and dried for 20 seconds with compressed air in groups one and two. After conditioning, group 1 received unfilled resin (Margin Bond, Colten) and group 2 received dentin bonding (Single Bond, 3 M) and in group 3 after conditioning and rinsing with water, a layer of dentin bonding (Single Bond) was applied on wet enamel. The enamel and dentin bonding were light cured for 20 seconds. A ring mold 3. 5 mm in diameter and 2 mm height was placed over the specimens to receive the composite filling material (Z 100, 3 M). The composite was cured for 40 seconds. The specimens were thermocycled and shear bond strengths were determined using an Instron Universal Testing Machine. The findings were analyzed by ANOVA One-Way and Tukey HSD tests. Results: Shear bond strength of dentin bonding to <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> was significantly less than unfilled resin to <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> (P< 0. 05). There was no significant difference between the bond strength of dentin bonding to moist and <b>dry</b> <b>enamel.</b> In addition bond strength of dentin bonding to wet enamel was not significantly different from unfilled resin to <b>dry</b> <b>enamel.</b> Conclusion: Based on the findings of this study, it is suggested that enamel surface should remain slightly moist after etching before bonding with single bond but when using unfilled resin, the enamel surface should be kept dry...|$|R

Materials and methodsOne conventional bracket and three different self-ligating brackets were bonded onto 160 bovine permanent mandibular incisors, divided randomly into 8 groups. For each type of bracket, 20 samples were bonded on <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> and 20 after water contamination. After 24 h, all specimens were tested for SBS using an Instron Universal Testing Machine, and ARI scores were evaluated. ResultsAll groups showed clinically adequate SBSs. Quick brackets bonded onto <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> showed significantly higher SBSs than all other groups tested, whereas the lowest shear strength values were recorded for Step, Quick, and Damon 3 MX brackets bonded onto contaminated enamel and for Damon 3 MX onto <b>dry</b> <b>enamel.</b> Frequency distribution of ARI Scores showed a prevalence of ARI “ 2 ” and “ 3 ” for all the groups tested.

Materials and methods 100 extracted premolars were stored in distilled water at 4 degrees Celsius. The teeth were cleaned, polished, and convenience distributed into 5 groups: (1) composite resin in <b>enamel</b> under <b>dry</b> conditions, (2) cyanoacrylate adhesive in <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> condition, (3) composite resin in enamel condition contaminated with artificial saliva before the primer, (4) composite resin enamel condition contaminated with artificial saliva after the primer, and (5) cyanoacrylate adhesive in artificial saliva contaminated enamel condition. The results showed that the adhesive system Transbond XT™ and Transbond MIP obtained the highest values of resistance to debonding in the <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> surface. ConclusionsThe adhesive system Transbond XT™ and Transbond MIP I provide an adequate in vitro resistance to debonding in every enamel condition. The system based on cyanoacrylate adhesive Smartbond obtained proper values of resistance to debonding in <b>dry</b> <b>enamel,</b> however it obtained the lowest values in contaminated with enamel artificial saliva conditions, unsuitable for orthodontics, and even some samples were not cemented successfully in vitro under these conditions...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} mechanical interlocking in the mechanism of enamel adhesion of composite resin in vivo. METHODS: Twenty patients had bilateral occlusal bite blocks bonded on posterior teeth to raise the bite during fixed orthodontic therapy. Depending on the individual clinical situation and enamel quality, {{the choice of the}} occlusal surfaces of teeth for the bite blocks included 35 o & 45 o, 16 o & 26 o and 36 o & 46 o. Composite resins (Z 100, 3 M) were syringed out of the capsules directly onto the acid etched and thoroughly <b>dried</b> <b>enamel</b> surfaces which had no liquid resin applied. The composite resins were light-cured and checked for even contacts between the left and right sides. The service durations of occlusal bite blocks recorded were analyzed by Kaplan Meier product limit method. RESULTS: 37 out of 40 (92. 5 %) of all the occlusal bite blocks lasted up to the end of their intended treatment purposes. They stayed on average for 36. 1 months (range 1. 5 to 45. 6 months) to completely serve their purposes in this case series. Three out of 40 occlusal bite blocks failed at 1. 5, 4. 1 and 5. 7 months, respectively. The one that failed at 1. 5 months was replaced to finish off the treatment. The other 2 bite blocks failed slightly before the treatment finished. They were not replaced. 17 out of 20 patients (85 %) experienced no failure of the occlusal bite blocks during their orthodontic treatment.

50|$|Vitreous enamel {{has many}} useful properties: it is smooth, hard, {{chemically}} resistant, durable, scratch resistant (5-6 on the Mohs scale), has long-lasting colour fastness, {{is easy to}} clean, and cannot burn. Enamel is glass, not paint, so it does not fade under ultraviolet light. A disadvantage of enamel {{is a tendency to}} crack or shatter when the substrate is stressed or bent, but modern enamels are relatively chip- and impact-resistant because of good thickness control and coefficients of thermal expansion well-matched to the metal. The Buick automobile company was founded by David Dunbar Buick with wealth earned by his development of improved <b>enamelling</b> <b>processes,</b> c. 1887, for sheet steel and cast iron. Such enameled ferrous material had, and still has, many applications: early 20th century and some modern advertising signs, interior oven walls, cooking pots, housing and interior walls of major kitchen appliances, housing and drums of clothes washers and dryers, sinks and cast iron bathtubs, farm storage silos, and processing equipment such as chemical reactors and pharmaceutical process tanks. Structures such as filling stations, bus stations and Lustron Houses had walls, ceilings and structural elements made of enamelled steel. One of the most widespread modern uses of enamel is in the production of quality chalk-boards and marker-boards (typically called 'blackboards' or 'whiteboards') where the resistance of enamel to wear and chemicals ensures that 'ghosting', or unerasable marks, do not occur, as happens with polymer boards. Since standard enamelling steel is magnetically attractive, it may also be used for magnet boards. Some new developments {{in the last ten years}} include enamel/non-stick hybrid coatings, sol-gel functional top-coats for enamels, enamels with a metallic appearance, and new easy-to-clean enamels.|$|R

Thus, {{the purpose of this}} study was to determine if SEPs used with an indirect bonding technique can provide acceptable bracket strengths under both dry and contaminated conditions. Sixty-four human maxillary premolars were cleaned, mounted, and randomly divided into four groups of sixteen. In group 1 (control), 16 orthodontic brackets were bonded to dry teeth using a traditional phosphoric acid etchant/primer; in group 2 (control), the same etchant/primer was used but saliva contamination occurred after the primer was applied; in group 3, a SEP was used on <b>dry</b> <b>enamel</b> surfaces; in group 4, the SEP was used, and saliva contamination occurred after SEP application. In all groups, the bonding adhesive and indirect bonding method were the same. The teeth were debonded ~ 36 hours following initial bonding using a universal testing machine. After debonding, the amount of residual adhesive remaining on each tooth was evaluated. Analysis of Variance was used to compare the shear bond strength of the four groups, and the Pearson exact test was used to compare the Adhesive Remnant Index (ARI) scores for the four groups. The Analysis of Variance (F= 1. 94) indicated that there were no significant differences (p = 0. 133) in bond strength between the groups. The comparisons of the ARI scores indicated that bracket failure mode was not significantly different (p = 0. 11). The present findings indicated that using an SEP with indirect bonding can provide acceptable bond strengths when bonding orthodontic brackets. Saliva contamination occurring after the placement of the primer or SEP had no negative effect on the shear bond strength; thus, the SEP provided no substantial benefit when bonding under contaminated conditions. For all groups, the ARI scores showed that the majority of the adhesive stayed on the teeth after debonding, providing evidence that contamination occurring after the primer/SEP application does not negatively affect the bond strength to enamel...|$|R

Potentially, these links provide a way to access life history of fossil species from teeth. Recently we assessed intra-specific predictions of the HHO on human children. We reported Retzius periodicity (RP) corresponded with enamel thickness, and cusp formation time, when calculated from isolated deciduous teeth. We proposed the biorhythm might not remain constant within an individual. Here, we test our findings. RP is compared between deciduous second and permanent first molars within the maxillae of four human children. Following this, we report the first RPs for deciduous teeth from modern great apes (n = 4), and compare these with new data for permanent teeth (n = 18) from these species, {{as well as with}} previously published values. We also explore RP in teeth that retain hypoplastic defects. Results show RP changed within the maxilla of each child, from thinner to thicker enameled molars, and from one side of a hypoplastic defect to the other. When considered alongside correlations between RP and cusp formation time, these observations provide further evidence that RP is associated with <b>enamel</b> growth <b>processes</b> and does not always remain constant within an individual. RP of 5 days for great ape deciduous teeth lay below the lowermost range of those from permanent teeth of modern orangutan and gorilla, and within the lowermost range of RPs from chimpanzee permanent teeth.

These findings provide a new framework from which to develop the HHO hypothesis, which can incorporate enamel growth along with other physiological systems.
