40|$|The HD Tree {{is a novel}} data structure, {{which was}} {{recently}} proposed by Yunfeng Gu to support multi-dimensional range queries in a distributed environment. My thesis work is a follow-up to the research on the HD Tree. It focuses on the basic routing strategies {{in order to support}} multi-dimensional range queries in the HD Tree. There are two basic routing strategies supported by the HD Tree data structure: hierarchical routing and <b>distributed</b> <b>routing.</b> Hierarchical routing is an adapted version of routing in the tree structure, while <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> is a novel routing strategy built over the distributed structure of the HD Tree in order to accommondate the distributed environment. Hierarchical routing can be applied to any source and destination pair in the HD Tree, but results in a massive work load on nodes near the root. It also has very limited options in case of a node failure. Although <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> is applied only to the source and destination pair at the same depth of the HD Tree, its communication load is distributed to two sets of nodes at neighboring depths. <b>Distributed</b> <b>routing</b> has more options to survive a node failure. In my thesis work, four <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms were explored. Each of these four is a stand-alone routing algorithm, and can be applied in different routing conditions. Both theoretical analysis and experimental results indicate that any routing algorithm alone is able to achieve similar or better performance compared to the equivalent tree structure. However, the significance of this thesis work pertains not only to the performance issue. These different routing algorithms provide multiple options to accommondate a changing environment. Based on my thesis work, there were two advanced routing algorithms developed, a X 2 X routing algorithm which is a combination of four <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms, and a DROCR algorithm which is a combination of the hierarchical and <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> algorithms. These algorithms not only achieve considerable performance gain over its equivalent tree structure, but also make the routing in the HD Tree highly error resilient and load balancing. They are the fundamental algorithms in supporting multi-dimensional range queries in the HD Tree...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{availability}} of {{increased number of}} resources on a single silicon chip is enforcing the designers {{to come up with}} mechanisms for efficient and effective management of these resources on a chip. Moreover defective components, chip virtualization and power-aware techniques may lead to irregular on chip interconnection topology making efficient routing a non trivial challenge. Nearly, all routing algorithms and topologies support switches that make use of routing tables for efficient routing. However memories do not scale well in terms of area and power consumption for the routing tables, thus not practical for scalable on chip networks. Logic based <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> (LBDR) is recently proposed as an alternative solution to the table based <b>distributed</b> <b>routing</b> which can drastically reduce the memory requirement even while being as efficient as table based <b>distributed</b> <b>routing.</b> LBDR is a simple methodology of routing that enables the removal of the routing tables at every switch and uses only a small set of bits per switch to enable efficient routing.
