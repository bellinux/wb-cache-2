5|$|The {{industry}} {{suffered a}} downturn {{between the two}} world wars, as working horses were replaced by lorries and peat demand dropped, but after the Second World War peat {{was used by the}} <b>horticultural</b> <b>industry</b> in increasing volumes, and harvesting expanded again. From 1947, experiments were made with locomotives on the tramways, and they soon replaced horses. A total of 23 had worked on the system {{by the time it was}} closed down. The extraction process was mechanised in the 1960s, with the introduction of machines that could cut and stack the peat turves. In 1981 mechanical loading of the turves into the trains was introduced. Surface milling of the peat was introduced in 1985, which completely stripped the surface of large areas of the moors.|$|E

By 1989, there were about [...] of permanent track on Hatfield Moors, and double that on Thorne Moors. Following {{the arrival of the}} Dutch workers in the 1890s, the community continued to expand with the arrival of workers from the Netherlands until about 1912, but most had returned to their country of origin by 1914. In the 1930s, the British Moss Litter Company employed around 160 people, and haulage was achieved by twelve horses. During the Second World War, the Ministry of Supply ran the works, and the workforce dropped to 138, although there were still twelve horses. After the war, several of the men were assisted by their wives, who helped with the stacking of the peat, but did not get paid for their labour. Numbers had dropped to 118 by the 1960s, although a number of unpaid wives were still working on the moors. With the increasing sales of peat for gardeners, the workforce increased to 185 by the mid-1970s, swelled by up to 90 contract workers during busy periods. The total annual output of dried peat at this time was around 45,000 tonnes, produced from 400,000 tonnes of wet peat, all of it going to the <b>horticultural</b> <b>industry.</b> Swinefleet Works stopped production in July 2000, and was fully decommissioned by September. Subsequently, peat from Thorne Moors was transferred to Hatfield for processing.|$|E

40|$|Residual {{chipping}} material, {{also called}} clean chip residual (CCR), has potential {{use as a}} growth substrate in the nursery and greenhouse <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries.</b> A survey was conducted in the southeastern United States among companies conducting harvesting operations on pine (Pinus sp.) plantations {{for the production of}} pulpwood in the forest industry. Fourteen operators in four states (Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, Florida) were visited to evaluate the on-site status of residual material. Sample analysis of CCR revealed that it was composed of ≈ 37. 7 % wood (range, 14. 2 % to 50. 5 %), 36. 6 % bark (range, 16. 1 % to 68. 5 %), 8. 8 % needles (range, 0. 1 % to 19. 2 %), and 16. 9 % indistinguishable (fine) particles (range, 7. 5 % to 31 %). pH ranged from 4. 3 to 5. 5 for all locations and electrical conductivity (EC) averaged 0. 24 mmho/cm. Most nutrients were in acceptable ranges for plant growth with the exception of three sites above recommended levels for iron and four sites for manganese. Survey participants estimated that ≈ 27. 5 % of the harvest site biomass was composed of CCR. Some harvesters were able to sell CCR as fuelwood to pulp mills, while others did not recover the residual material and left it on the forest floor (44. 3 % total site biomass). Operations in this survey included typical pine plantation chipping and grinding operations (harvesters), woodyards (lumber, fuelwood, etc.), and operations processing mixed material (salvage from trees damaged in hurricanes or mixed tree species cleared from a site that was not under management as a plantation). Residual material varied depending on the plantation age, species composition, site quality, and natural actions such as fire. Average tree age was 11. 5 years (range, 8 to 15 years), while average tree stand height was 37. 0 ft (range, 25 to 50 ft) and average diameter at breast height (DBH) was 5. 9 inches (range, 4 to 7 inches). Residual material on site was either sold immediately (28. 6 %), left on site for 1 to 3 months (28. 6 %), left on site for up to 2 years (7. 1 %), or not collected/sold (35. 7 %). Several loggers were interested in making CCR available to <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries.</b> Adequate resources are available to <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries,</b> rendering the use of CCR in ornamental plant production a viable option...|$|R

Regulation of bud break is also of signifi cant economic importance to fruit and <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries.</b> Bud break in protected raspberry crops is often poor and uneven, with many lateral buds failing to break at all.

40|$|In theory, {{consumers}} 2 ̆ 7 {{perceptions of}} fruit quality should drive production, marketing {{and research and}} development processes. This is being ‘marketing oriented’. In practice, in new <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries,</b> {{a great deal of}} effort is often expended in improving production parameters such as yield, size and reliability without knowing much about the demand for the product. Some new industries have failed because consumers 2 ̆ 7 perceptions of the product were not understood. This overemphasis on production-based information has even more serious consequences in newly emerging <b>horticultural</b> <b>industries</b> which are export oriented, because here, production and consumption are often separated both geographically and culturally. This paper presents a case study of the role of consumer perceptions {{in the development of the}} Australian non-astringent persimmon industry. The industry began from a zero base in the late 19702 ̆ 7 s and will be worth AUD 15 – 20 million by the year 2000. Its development has been driven by the potential to export to Asian markets, particularly Singapore. Focus groups with Singapore consumers identified colour and sweetness (including non-astringency) as key attributes of Australian non-astringent persimmons. Size and freedom from blemish were also important. This information was used in two ways. First we developed a quality management program focused on meeting consumer needs. Then, to embed these quality management concepts in the perceptions of consumers, we used focus group information to name and develop our brand, “Sweet Gold”. This approach to developing the non-astringent persimmon industry underpins the activities of the Australian Persimmon Export Company, an industry-wide group of key growers exporting 60 percent of Australia 2 ̆ 7 s crop. This company 2 ̆ 7 s vision is to achieve sustainable profitability through better consumer understanding...|$|R
