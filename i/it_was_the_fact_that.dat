Castellaneta was also a regular participant in The Ron Petke and His Dead Uncle Show, a radio show at NIU. The show helped Castellaneta hone his skills as a voice-over actor. He recalled [...] "We did parodies and sketches, we would double up on, so you learned to switch between voices. I got my feet wet doing voiceover. The show was just barely audible, but we didn't care. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> we got a chance to do it and write our own material." [...] He took a play-writing class and auditioned for an improvisational show. A classmate first thought Castellaneta would [...] "fall on his face with improvisation" [...] but soon [...] "was churning out material faster than [...] could make it work." ...|$|E
500|$|According to some writers, Sex {{also helped}} Madonna {{make a name}} in the porn industry, and earned her the title of S's first {{cultural}} ambassador and was praised for recreating [...] "porn-chic". Humberto Quiroga Lavié pointed out that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> Sex was considered pornographic that helped it become a bestseller. Steve Bachmann, on his book Simulating Sex: Aesthetic Representations of Erotic Activity pointed out that [...] "perhaps {{one of the most}} interesting aspects of Madonna's sexual phenomenon is the extent to which her book marked a new threshold in the pornographic franchise". McNair wrote in his book that [...] "Sex brought out the personal underground to the surface of pop culture". London art critic Sarah Kent wrote in Time Out magazine that the timing of Sex was [...] "impeccable. Obsessions about the human body was in vogue, with Madonna's book as well as artist Andres Serrano's [...] "cumming shots" [...] and Jeff Koons' The Jeff Koons Handbook, the latter portrayed fairytale pictures of the artist having sex with his pornographic actor wife, Cicciolina.|$|E

After Madonna accepted Hooper's suggestion to collaborate with Massive Attack, the band sent Madonna {{the music of the}} song first. Robert [...] "3D" [...] Del Naja, one of the band members, subsequently went to New York with Hooper and worked in the studio for two days. Del Naja said, [...] "I think the really cool thing about <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> [...] sang it so beautifully. There was no special effects, no messing around—it was just in there singing it with a lot of passion and soul." [...] The opening track of the compilation, [...] "I Want You" [...] starts with a long introduction featuring a hip-hop drum beat with emphasis on the bass section of the instrumental alongside a semi-tonal string figure. The second verse features a harp and a repeating drum loop accompanied with a telephone style bleeping sound. Madonna's vocals at times are accompanied by spoken passages with her overall vocals dominating the track, with lyrics discussing a man that no longer wants her, while she is determined to change his mind. The compilation closes with the orchestral version of [...] "I Want You" [...] in which the original drum track, bass and percussion are removed. The version starts slower with Madonna's vocals entering with a low string bass line only, gradually more string arrangements are added with harp and brass featured in the background of the mix. A moment {{towards the end of the}} track hears her voice with no accompaniment creating a [...] "dramatic" [...] theme, and overall the version features around 20 seconds less than the original.|$|E

Riegel left the role and returned several times, before permanently retiring from the role in 2010. [...] She attributed her 2008 return to the wishes of her fans. Through the web presence she created for herself during her web series Imaginary Bitches, fans let her know how much they wanted {{her back on the}} show.

[...] " [...] next thing I knew I got a call and they said, 'Okay, we've got something for you,'" [...] she said. The story the All My Children writers came up with involved a new love interest for Bianca, Reese Williams, who would be portrayed by daytime alumni Tamara Braun. Riegel addressed specific reasons she made the return. [...] "It was the storyline that got me excited," [...] she said. [...] "I always want to come back. I love All My Children, and they’re my family. I barely need an excuse -- it’s usually just about timing." [...] Riegel added that [...] "this time <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>the</b> <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> {{they were going to have}} Bianca in a committed relationship".

In the context of that, there’s some pretty exciting story line plot points that I’m aware of that are dramatic and fun to play and enticing as an actress." [...] In addition, Riegel was enthused about playing opposite Braun.
