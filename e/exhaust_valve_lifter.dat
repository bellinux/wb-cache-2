50|$|The Powerplus had twist grips on both handles; the {{throttle}} {{was controlled by}} the left twist grip while the right twist grip advanced or retarded the spark. Three controls were {{on the right side}} of the gas tank, a vertically-operated shifter, an <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifter,</b> and a hand clutch lever. The clutch lever was linked to the clutch pedal positioned on the left side of the bike.|$|E
50|$|During the Isle of Man TT {{practice}} in 1928 two fast laps were attempted {{and it was}} rumoured that under certain conditions the lower front ends of the swinging-fork assembly grounded and possibly the centre stand as well. Due to this problem it was not used in the actual race. In fact {{an article published in}} the 21 June issue of the Motor Cycle attributed the failure to complete the two high speed laps to a loose <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> affecting the valve operation. The motorcycle was not used in the actual race and was returned to the Birmingham factory. Despite assurances that the journalist apparently received that the model would go straight into production after the TT, this never happened. This could have been due to there being no provision for adjusting the suspension resulting in difficulty in setting the motorcycle up for riders of differing weights nor would it be possible to accommodate pillion loads.|$|E
5000|$|The {{drop-forged steel}} six-throw {{crankshaft}} runs in seven main bearings; unlike {{the majority of}} wide angle V6 engines which have only four main bearings. [...] The connecting rod bearing journals are offset 22° to one another. [...] Two overhead camshafts (OHCs) operate the automatic hydraulic <b>valve</b> <b>lifters</b> which, in turn, open and close the 39.0 mm intake and 34.3 mm <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> Since the two 'rows' of pistons and cylinders share a single cylinder head and head gasket, the piston crown (or top surface) is tilted. Intake and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> need different camshafts to vary valve overlap (they may be coaxial like in some 90° V8).|$|R
50|$|Valve {{clearance}} {{refers to}} the small gap between a <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and a <b>valve</b> stem that ensures that the valve completely closes. On engines with mechanical valve adjustment, excessive clearance causes noise from the valve train. A too small valve clearance can result in the valves not closing properly, {{this results in a}} loss of performance and possibly overheating of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves.</b> Typically, the clearance must be readjusted each 20000 mi with a feeler gauge.|$|R

5000|$|In a F-head/IOE engine, {{the intake}} {{manifold}} and its valves are located atop the cylinders, in the cylinder head, and are operated by rocker arms which reverse {{the motion of}} the pushrods so that the intake valves open downward into the combustion chamber. The exhaust manifold and its valves are located beside or as part of the cylinders, in the block. The <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are either roughly or exactly parallel with the pistons; their faces point upwards and they are not operated by separate pushrods, but by contact with a camshaft through the tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and an integrated valve stem/pushrod. The valves were offset to one side, forming {{what seemed to be a}} pocket, leading to the term [...] "pocket valve" [...] being used for IOE engines. An F-head engine combines features from both overhead-valve and flathead type engines, the inlet valve operating via pushrod and rocker arm and opening downward like an overhead valve engine, while the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is offset from the cylinder and opens upward via an integrated pushrod/valve stem directly actuated by the camshaft, much like the valves in a flathead engine.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{hot gases}} {{produced}} by the internal combustion engines passes through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and causes high temperatures in the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. To avoid damaging the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> heat must be transferred from the valve to its seat during the contact they make at the opening and closing cycle. Heat transfer rate from the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> to its seat {{is a function of}} many factors. One of the most important factors is the thermal contact conductance (TCC) between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Very few researches have been done about estimation of the TCC between the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat in the past. An experimental study has been conducted to determine the TCC between two co-axial cylinders, as the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and its seat. Furthermore, the influence of contact pressure and frequency of contact upon the TCC is studied. The results show that the TCC decreases as the frequency of contact increases. The experimental results obtained from the presen...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — The system aims at {{modifying the}} {{position}} and diameter of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> {{in order to reduce}} the probability of knocking (both in SI and in CI) and lessen the dilution of charge because of the small size of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> when compared to the size of inlet valve. The size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is smaller when compared to the size of inlet valve. It is done so because the region closer to the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is at a higher temperature compared to that of the temperature surrounding the inlet valve. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> size is increased there will be higher possibility of knocking because the charge coming inside the combustion chamber has a higher probability of combusting at <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve’s</b> surface (due to large surface area). On the other hand if the size is too small then, there will be greater possibility of dilution in the intake charge because there is no enough space for the burnt gas to leave the chamber. To reduce these problems, modifications in the engine is proposed. In general inlet and <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> are positioned vertically along the axis of the combustion chamber. Now if the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis (i. e. perpendicular to the cylinder axis) and if the size of the valve is increased then there will be less possibility for the dilution. But the probability of knocking increases. Since the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is placed along the horizontal axis, the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> will be in contact with the water cooling system of the combustion chamber (outside the chamber). Thus this cooling system or the coolant will be able to release the heat at the outer surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> and transfer heat from the seat surface of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> (commonly in tappet valves). The rate of Heat Transfer will be high because the surface area perpendicular to heat flow direction is large thereby enhancing heat transfer. The possibility of the dilution is reduced because, during the piston movement from BDC (Bottom Dead Center) to the TDC (Top Dead Center) the piston pushes the burnt gases outside through the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> since the size of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> is increased, it is easie...|$|R

25|$|The {{diaphragm}} is {{a flexible}} cover to the medium (intermediate) pressure chamber. When the diver consumes {{gas from the}} second stage, the pressure falls in the medium pressure chamber and the diaphragm deforms inwards pushing against the <b>valve</b> <b>lifter.</b> This opens the high pressure valve permitting gas to flow past the valve seat into the medium-pressure chamber. When the diver stops inhaling, pressure in the medium pressure chambers rises and the diaphragm returns to its neutral flat position and no longer presses on the <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> shutting off the flow until the next breath is taken.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. MAN Diesel’s 6 S 50 MC-C disel is a {{two-stroke}} {{marine diesel}} engine. Preload of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component is applied in four bolts. The preload of bolts {{can improve the}} fatigue strength of the exhaust component. In addition, the bolt pretension ensure the sealing in the maximum firing pressure. Using of simulation method, the displacement and deformation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component are analyzed when the maximum firing pressure and preload are applied. By analysis of the deformation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing under different preload force, the deformation of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing increase with the increaseing of preload. The maximum total deformation is 0. 40 mm in the preload of 720 KN. The maximum deformation occurs in the region near the bolt {{in the side of}} exhaust gas outlet. The deformation in the direction of Y-axis of <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> housing is along the Y-axis opposite direction when the preload is greater than 540 KN. This indicates that the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> seal well. The sealing and deformation of the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> component meets the desgin requirement...|$|R
50|$|Early/late <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closingEarly {{and late}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> closing can also reduce emissions. Traditionally, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> opens, and <b>exhaust</b> gas is {{pushed out of}} the {{cylinder}} and into the exhaust manifold by the piston as it travels upward. By manipulating {{the timing of the}} <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve,</b> engineers can control how much exhaust gas is left in the cylinder. By holding the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valve</b> open slightly longer, the cylinder is emptied more and ready to be filled with a bigger air/fuel charge on the intake stroke. By closing the valve slightly early, more exhaust gas remains in the cylinder which increases fuel efficiency. This allows for more efficient operation under all conditions.|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} IOE layouts used atmospheric {{inlet valves}} which were held {{closed with a}} weak spring and were opened by the pressure differential created when the piston went down on the inlet stroke. This worked well with low-speed early engines and {{had the benefit of}} being very simple and cheap, but the weak spring was unable to close the valve fast enough as the RPM's of engines increased, necessitating stronger springs, which in turn needed direct mechanical action to open, as the atmospheric pressure of 15psi limits the total force available from creating a pressure differential, meaning that a 15-lb spring is the strongest that can be used (for practical purposes, {{it would have to be}} lighter still). When the limits of this system were reached, the design was improved without substantial changes to the head casting by adding a mechanical system to open the inlet valves and stronger springs to close them. In both cases, the <b>exhaust</b> <b>valves</b> were in the block and were opened by contact with a camshaft through a tappet or <b>valve</b> <b>lifter</b> and closed by springs.|$|R
