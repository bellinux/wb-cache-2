To solve this problem three different structural systems were used to support the 10 story tall building over the 78 meter clear span. These were an X-braced truss system, a 10 story <b>catenary</b> <b>suspension</b> system, and a parabolic arch system. It is basically a building-bridge hybrid.|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{elongated}} {{shape of}} the city and the terrain conditions, the trolleybus network was planned along main streets. The network is powered with overhead lines because most of the network is located on wide, bi-directional streets.

From 1998, the overhead lines began to be overhauled with modern <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> produced by the Czech company Elektroline. Almost 80% of overhead line intersections and junctions were replaced with new parts. These new parts allow trolleybuses to use greater speeds. Additionally, 32 sectional isolators and two sectional disconnectors were installed.|$|R

40|$|A ringsail parachute, {{which had}} a nominal {{diameter}} of 40 feet (12. 2 meters) and reference area of 1256 square feet (117 m(exp 2)) and was modified to provide a total geometric porosity of 15 percent of the reference area, was flight tested {{as part of the}} rocket launch portion of the NASA Planetary Entry Parachute Program. The payload for the flight test was an instrumented capsule from which the test parachute was ejected by a deployment mortar when the system was at a Mach number of 1. 64 and a dynamic pressure of 9. 1 pounds per square foot (43. 6 newtons per m(exp 2)). The parachute deployed to <b>suspension</b> <b>line</b> stretch in 0. 45 second with a resulting snatch force of 1620 pounds (7200 newtons). Canopy inflation began 0. 07 second later and the parachute projected area increased slowly to a maximum of 20 percent of that expected for full inflation. During this test, the <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> twisted, primarily because the partially inflated canopy could not restrict the twisting to the attachment bridle and risers. This twisting of the <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> hampered canopy inflation at a time when velocity and dynamic-pressure conditions were more favorable...|$|R

50|$|The {{recovery}} sequence {{begins with}} {{the operation of the}} high-altitude baroswitch, which triggers the pyrotechnic nose cap thrusters. This ejects the nose cap, which deploys the pilot parachute. Nose cap separation occurs at a nominal altitude of 15704 ft, about 218 seconds after SRB separation. The 11.5 ft diameter conical ribbon pilot parachute provides the force to pull lanyards attached to cut knives, which cut the loop securing the drogue retention straps. This allows the pilot chute to pull the drogue pack from the SRB, causing the drogue <b>suspension</b> <b>lines</b> to deploy from their stored position. At full extension of the twelve 105 ft <b>suspension</b> <b>lines,</b> the drogue deployment bag is stripped away from the canopy, and the 54 ft diameter conical ribbon drogue parachute inflates to its initial reefed condition. The drogue disreefs twice after specified time delays (using redundant 7 and 12-second reefing line cutters), and it reorients/stabilizes the SRB for main chute deployment.

The force of lining structure is studied using numerical simulation based on the research and analysis of relevant theory and model test results. Firstly, the variation of the air pressure in the tunnel was calculated caused by the train when it is passing through the tunnel at different speeds (200 ~ 400 km/h).

The maximum normal stress of tunnel lining with train speed according to the power law, and maximum normal stress with train speed according to quadratic function relation; 2. Tunnel lining is subjected to push-pull stress because the magnitude and direction of aerodynamic loads change with the advance of the train; 3. The lining structure is mainly subjected to the stress of the Y direction, and this stress should not be neglected when design the structure of tunnel secondary lining. 4. The load spectrum of the lining structure under different train speed is given. The research results of this paper are of great significance to the optimization design of tunnel lining structure...|$|R
