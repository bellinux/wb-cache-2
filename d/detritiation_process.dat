40|$|The detritiation of L-[3 - 3 H] alanine in the {{reaction}} catalyzed by pig heart glutamate-pyruvate transaminase was monitored {{in the absence}} or presence of lactate dehydrogenase. The results indicated that each monodirectional conversion of L-[3 - 3 H] alanine to [3 - 3 H] pyruvate resulted in the generation of 3 HOH at a rate representing one-third of the total 3 H flux. No isotopic discrimination in reaction velocity between tritiated and 14 C-labelled L-alanine was observed. The mathematical modelling of {{the reaction}} revealed that, {{as a consequence of}} the <b>detritiation</b> <b>process,</b> the steady-state ratio in L-[3 - 3 H] alanine/[3 - 3 H] pyruvate does not inform on either the absolute or relative size of the amino acid and 2 -keto acid pools.
