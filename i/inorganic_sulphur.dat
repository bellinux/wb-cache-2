40|$|Abstract Background Coryne{{bacterium}} glutamicum is a high-GC Gram-positive soil bacterium {{of great}} biotechnological {{importance for the}} production of amino acids. To facilitate the rational design of sulphur amino acid-producing strains, the pathway for assimilatory sulphate reduction providing the necessary reduced sulfur moieties has to be known. Although this pathway has been well studied in Gram-negative bacteria like Escherichia coli and low-GC Gram-positives like Bacillus subtilis, little is known for the Actinomycetales and other high-GC Gram-positive bacteria. Results The genome sequence of C. glutamicum was searched for genes involved in the assimilatory reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds. A cluster of eight candidate genes could be identified by combining sequence similarity searches with a subsequent synteny analysis between C. glutamicum and the closely related C. efficiens. Using mutational analysis, seven of the eight candidate genes, namely cysZ, cysY, cysN, cysD, cysH, cysX, and cysI, were demonstrated {{to be involved in the}} reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds. For three of the up to now unknown genes possible functions could be proposed: CysZ is likely to be the sulphate permease, while CysX and CysY are possibly involved in electron transfer and cofactor biosynthesis, respectively. Finally, the candidate gene designated fpr 2 influences sulphur utilisation only weakly and might be involved in electron transport for the reduction of sulphite. Real-time RT-PCR experiments revealed that cysIXHDNYZ form an operon and that transcription of the extended cluster fpr 2 cysIXHDNYZ is strongly influenced by the availability of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> as well as L-cysteine. Mapping of the fpr 2 and cysIXHDNYZ promoters using RACE-PCR indicated that both promoters overlap with binding-sites of the transcriptional repressor McbR, suggesting an involvement of McbR in the observed regulation. Comparative genomics revealed that large parts of the extended cluster are conserved in 11 of 17 completely sequenced members of the Actinomycetales. Conclusion The set of C. glutamicum genes involved in assimilatory sulphate reduction was identified and four novel genes involved in this pathway were found. The high degree of conservation of this cluster among the Actinomycetales supports the hypothesis that a different metabolic pathway for the reduction of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds than that known from the well-studied model organisms E. coli and B. subtilis is used by members of this order, providing the basis for further biochemical studies. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{limitation}} of {{fossil fuel resources}} {{and the necessity of}} reducing CO 2 emission require an increase of the efficiency of coal based power plants. The Integrated Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) is a potential concept to realise these objectives. In the IGCC a broad range of different coals can be used to produce a fuel gas for gas turbines or synthesis gas for chemical applications. The direct use of hot flue gas for driving a gas turbine requires a hot gas cleanup to achieve corrosion prevention of the turbine blades and prevention of catalysts from poisoning. Main problems are related to alkali metal, sulphur, and chlorine compounds released during the coal gasification process. High and low-rank coals differ in the amount, mode of occurrence and release mechanism of alkali metal, sulphur, and chlorine. Therefore, release experiments have been done with 8 different coals at 1400 °C, 1 atm and a gas stream with 7. 5 % O 2 and 2. 5 % water steam. Differences of the release mechanisms of high and low-rank coals were identified.

Biodesulphurisation technology applied as a method to remove sulphur before coal combustion was investigated in this work. The desulphurisation abilities of three specific bacterial strains including Rhodococcus erythropolis IGTS 8, R. erythropolis X 309 and Shewanella putrefaciens strain NCIMB 8768 have been evaluated. R. erythropolis IGTS 8 and X 309 were found to be able to remove both <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> from model compounds and coal samples. Their abilities to remove sulphur from benzothiophene were observed for the first time. A novel desulphurising bacterium, S. putrefaciens was also found to be able to remove <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> from coal samples. The bacterium, however, lost its ability to remove organic sulphur from model compounds during the investigation. R. erythropolis IGTS 8 presented the greatest desulphurisation efficiency among the three bacterial strains. Nevertheless, the desulphurisation activity of R. erythropolis IGTS 8 was too low for an economical coal biodesulphurisation process as it removed only 32. 0 % of total sulphur in bituminous coal, and 21. 1 % of total sulphur in anthracite coal. Alternatively, coal biodesulphurisation can be carried out in inexpensive conditions by using the bacteria inherent in the coal itself. The type of coal has an important effect on desulphurisation efficiency since the sulphur reduction in bituminous coal, which is in a lower rank than anthracite, was greater than the sulphur reduction in anthracite coal. This work also developed and evaluated the analytical methods used in the field. A HPLC method was developed to detect the desulphurisation metabolites of model compounds.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} is to {{investigate}} the possibilities of minimizing the sulphur content in Kraft lignin. Kraft lignin contains about 1. 5 to 3 % sulphur. The sulphur {{is believed to be}} present in lignin as <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> as elemental sulphur, as adsorbed polysulphide and/or as organically bound sulphur. For the determination of these different types of sulphur components, different approaches and methods were used. For the determination of <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> lignin was washed with water at pH 6 and pH 2 and the wash waters were analysed with ion chromatography (IC). For the determination of total sulphur content in the lignin, two methods were used; Schöniger combustion followed by ion chromatography (IC) and wet digestion followed by inductively coupled plasma (ICP). The elemental sulphur content in water-extracted lignin was determined after n-pentane extraction. ICP analysis was performed on the washed lignin. Calcium present in the lignin may bind polysulphides and thus be a source of the observed sulphur. The lignin was thus ion-exchanged to remove any calcium. To further investigate how the sulphur content in lignin can be decreased, two different types of reactions were performed on lignin; oxidation and reduction. The oxidation reactions were made in sodium hydroxide with oxygen at different temperatures and time on both original and water-extracted lignin. The reduction reactions were made on water-extracted lignin with Raney nickel in three different solvent systems: methanol: water, acetone: water and sodium hydroxide.   The original lignin contained 2. 6 % sulphur as determined by ICP. Washing lowered the content to 1. 85 % sulphur. By n-pentane extraction the elemental sulphur was lowered to a level of 1. 82 % sulphur, which was considered to be organically bound sulphur. Neither the ion exchange nor the oxidation lowered the sulphur content significantly.   The reduction reactions successfully the organically bound sulphur from 1. 82 % to a level of 0. 54 %.   The relative distribution of the sulphur content in the studied softwood lignin was as follows: about 29 % as <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur,</b> about 1 % as elemental sulphur and approximately 70 % as organically bound sulphur, of which 49 % could be removed by Raney nickel...|$|E

The sulphur content of 76 different feedstuffs commonly used to formulate pig diets was evaluated from INRA‐AFZ database. Total sulphur content varied between 0. 5 and 15. 3 g S/kg dry matter. For most of the feedstuffs, protein sulphur contributed to most of the sulphur content. However, <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> was also found at a high level in some feedstuffs, especially in by‐products from industrial process. In vivo experiments were conducted on fattening pigs individually housed in metabolic cages for collection of excreta. Eleven experimental diets, mainly based on wheat and on soybean meal, were compared. They differed by their protein content and the incorporation of feedstuffs with different total sulphur content (wheat, dried distiller’s grains with solubles, sugar beet pulp or rapeseed meal). Sulphur supply varied between 3. 1 and 8. 3 g S/pig/day. Sulphur retention by animals was not affected by the diet and amounted to 1. 1 g S/pig/day on average. Sulphur excretion was highly affected by the diet and varied from 1. 5 to 6. 9 g/pig/day. Sulphur digestibility was 79 % on average and urinary sulphur excretion represented 55 % of intake.

This concentrate is a multi-mineral resource in which the copper sulphides are mainly chalcocite, covellite, bornite and chalcopyrite. The experiments undertaken to produce the techno-economic data were also an opportunity to carry out more fundamental research. The objective of this work was to combine {{the results of the}} bioleaching experiments, in terms of copper recovery, with the results of bacterial community monitoring and mineralogy residue analysis. Batch and continuous bioleaching tests were carried out with 10 % solids, at 42 °C and with a pH between 1. 2 and 1. 6. Final copper recovery was higher in batch cultures than in continuous mode (> 95 % vs. 91 %). Mineralogical analysis showed that the limiting factor for copper recovery was incomplete chalcopyrite dissolution in both cases. However, chalcopyrite was even less dissolved in continuous conditions. This was also related to a variation in bacterial community structure. The population in all tests was composed of Acidithiobacillus caldus, Leptospirillum ferriphilum and one or two species of Sulfobacillus (Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans and sometimes Sulfobacillus benefaciens), but Sulfobacillus and more generally sulphur oxidizers were more represented in batch mode.

Back trajectory modelling illustrated that a remote site, like ELA, is affected by distant Hg point sources in Canada and the United States. The sources identified from correlation analysis, principal components analysis and K-means cluster analysis were generally consistent. The discrepancies between the K-means and Hierarchical cluster analysis were the clusters related to transport of industrial/combustion emissions, photochemical production of RGM, and crustal/soil emissions. Although it was possible to assign the clusters to these source origins, the trajectory plots for the Hierarchical clusters were similar to some of the trajectories belonging to several K-means clusters.

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{utilization}} of several <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> compounds by three strains of Clostridium perfringens {{and the production}} of hydrogen sulphide from these compounds was investigated. Sulphate, sulphite, thiosulphate and sulphide cannot supply sulphur to the organism, neither do they have any effect, when added in non-toxic concentrations, on the growth in media containing utilizable organic sulphur. Cystine or cysteine, which can be replaced by glutathione, were required by the three strains tested; no additional sulphur source was needed by two of the strains, the third requiring also methionine, which can be replaced by homocyst (e) ine. Hydrogen sulphide is produced by growing cultures from sulphite, thiosulphate, cystine, cysteine and glutathione, but not from methionine. Different enzyme systems are concerned with hydrogen sulphide production from cystine and sulphite, respectively. The sulphite-reducing capacity of some cultures was often decreased after several passages in laboratory media, the presence of nicotinamide being then required for this reduction.

Excessive organic matter (OM) and sulphur compounds in sediments are often claimed to be major environmental co-factors triggering these events.

In order to assess these relationships, we conducted monthly field investigations between 2001 and 2002, at three regularly-spaced stations set between the inlet and {{the mouth of the}} Cabras lagoon. Results showed reduced conditions of sediments, worsening during the warm season. This was consistent with very high OM contents, up to > 20 %, with annual means of 14 - 16 %. Organic pollution-tolerant taxa, such as Tubificidae nc, Neanthes succinea and Polydora ciliata, dominated poor macrofaunal communities. Results of multivariate analysis indicated significant differences in both environmental variables and macrofaunal community structure and species composition between stations and through different periods.

We conclude that impoverished macrofaunal communities in the Cabras lagoon may show a slight recovery during winter-spring, but tend to regress to an early stage of faunal succession in late summer. We suggest that the combination of excessive amounts of sedimentary organic matter and high temperatures tends to lead to anoxic conditions especially in relatively deeper and more saline waters.

40|$|New {{methods have}} been {{developed}} for determining and/or speciating several important <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> species, including: thiosulphate, sulphate, sulphite, sulphide and polysulphide in kraft pulping liquors and effluents by capillary zone electrophoresis. In addition, several other key anions, including: hydroxide, carbonate, oxalate, formate and chloride can be quantified in the same process liquors. Two approaches were developed for determining the anions. In one method, anions were baseline resolved and quantified using sodium chromate, tetradecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide-based electrolytes with indirect UV-detection. In the second scheme, polysulphide was speciated, and sulphur species such as sulphide, thiosulphate and sulphite, as well as hydroxide were separated and determined using a sodium sulphate, tetradecyltrimethylammonium hydroxide-based electrolyte with direct UV-detection. A third approach, involving the use a 2 - (N-Cyclohexylamino) ethanesulfonic acid, hexamethonium hydroxide electrolyte with conductivity detection was also briefly examined and found to be unsuitable for the analysis of sulphide-bearing samples...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} {{ruminants}} to utilize <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> was first indicated by Warth (1932) {{and has been}} confirmed by many workers in recent years (Moir et al., 1967). The reduction of inorganic sulphate to sulphide has been demonstrated in the rumen (Lewis, 1954; Anderson, 1956) and in vitro (Henderickx, 1961) and <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> amino acids of rumen microbial protein (Block et al., 1951; Henderickx 1961). Finally cysteine and methionine synthesized in the rumen have been isolated from tissue proteins of. the host animal (Block and Stekol, 1950; Kulwich et al., 1957). Although a vast quantity of literature exists concerning the biology of micro-organisms that oxidize and reduce <b>inorganic</b> <b>sulphur</b> compounds, until recently little was known about the enzymatic mechanisms involved in the metabolism of these compounds. A large and diverse group of micro-organisms reduces sulphate in the small amounts required for the synthesis of cellular material, {{as evidenced by the}} ability of these organisms to grow on sulphate as their sole source of sulphur. This small-scale reduction of sulphate has been termed assimilatory sulphate reduction (Postgate, 1959). A much smaller group of micro-organisms reduces sulphate in great excess of nutritional requirements and produces massive amounts of sulphide. This large scale reduction of sulphate to sulphide has been termed dissimilatory sulphate reduction (Postgate, 1959). The chemical reduction of sulphate is a relatively difficult reaction and little progress was made on the mechanisms of biological sulphate reduction until Robbins and Lipmann (1958) simultaneously with Wilson and Bandurski (1958) elucidated the mechanism of sulphate activation in a number of organisms. Their observations, along with the initial observations of De Melo and Wizerkanisk (1956) are summarized in reviews by Gregory and Robbins (1960) and Wilson (1962). However, little if any published work relates to the mechanisms of sulphate reduction in the rumen. This investigation was designed to show that the reduction of inorganic sulphate in the rumen of sheep followed a similar pathway as that of Robbins and Lipmann (1958) and Wilson and Bandurski (1958). The initial stages involved the isolation of the intermediates adenosine- 5 '-phosphosulphate (PAPS) and 3 '-phospho -adenosine- 5 '- phosphosulphate (APS) from the rumen by use of S 35 -labelled sodium sulphate and the remainder of the experimental work was designed to show by use of the group V 1 anions - molybdate, selenate, chromate and tungstate - that the enzyme ATP-sulphurylase was involved in the activation of sulphate by ATP prior to reduction. The review of literature covers the general sulphur metabolism and a further section discusses the bacterial sulphate reduction in more detail. The experimental section of this thesis is divided into two parts. In part A, the isolation of APS and PAPS is presented. In section B the preliminary responses of the group V 1 anions on inorganic 4 sulphate reduction are presented followed by a more detailed study of the responses to these group V 1 anions. Finally the behaviour of pure species Desulphovibris desulphuricans - and sulphate-reducing bacteria isolated from the rumen in response to group V 1 anions has been investigated. Raw experimental data and statistical analyses have been recorded in the appendices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{serves to}} {{describe}} the elimination of toxic gas emissions in coal combustion chambers and activity of expanded clay soaked MgO and other alkali materials such as Lime, Hydrated lime, NaCl, MgCl 2 and KCl used in desulfurization. An chemical analysis of ash materials used to characterize the elimination of toxic substances was carried out. As well, {{the ability of the}} expanded clay to remove <b>inorganic</b> and organic <b>sulphur</b> and other pollutant substances were determined with their respective process control challenges. In this study, combustion tests of ??rnak asphaltite and different types of Turkish lignites; K?tahya Gediz, Tun?bilek, Soma K?srakdere were carried out. Lime, Hydrated lime, Magnesia, NaCl, MgCl 2 and KCl were used as desulfurizing solid sorbent. The different type of solid sorbents such as ??rnak limestone, marly limestone and claystone, MgO soaked expanded clay use in coal desulfurization were virtually investigated and discussed. Combustion of solid fuels in the presence of expanded clay was managed at low particle sized such as 1 - 2 mm. Expanded clay was examined as an absorbent for a conversion of toxic gas to friendly emissions. It can be a promising waste incineration for the production of electricity from nylon and plastic contaminated municipal wastes because of high activity in the collection and leaching in the toxic gas in the combustion reaction...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogen Sulfide (H 2 S, rotten-egg) {{is one of}} {{the major}} {{environmental}} pollutants having its sources in natural and anthropogenic activities. It’s had smell gas produced by anaerobic digestion in acid condition from organic and <b>inorganic</b> compounds containing <b>sulphur,</b> presents dual problems of its toxicity and foul ordour. One of methods of its removal is adsorption. Activated carbon is a widely used adsorbent in the treatment of air pollution. Adsorption type and capacity are primarily based on the physical properties of pores, namely the surface area. Convetionnally, activated carbon is produced from biomass residues, wood coal and agricultural residuces. Today, one promising approach for the production of cheap and efficient activated carbon is used of waste from palm oil mill industries, which is palm oil shell. Palm oil shell is available in large quantities of approximately 0. 53 million tonnes annually in Thailand. Palm oil shell is a by-products of the palm oil industry and was used as a raw material in this study due to its high carbon content, high density and low ash content. Normally, H 2 S in biogas, which is found the range between as low as about 50 - 10, 000 ppm depending on the feed material composition to prodction, can cause corrosion to engine and metal substance via of SO 2 from combustion. H 2 S must be removed from biogas product prior to further utilization. Therefore, in thes...|$|R
40|$|Industrial and {{technological}} {{developments of the}} past 100 years have resulted in significant perturbations to the global sulphur cycle. The use of biomonitors, such as lichens, for quantifying environmental changes has grown in importance over the last decades and offers promising developments for the understanding of global elemental cycles. [...] The present {{study was designed to}} investigate the response of lichens to changes in atmospheric sulphur conditions, as measured by changes in sulphur isotopic composition and concentration in lichen thalli. A reciprocal transplant of lichen thalli was performed between a "polluted" and "unpolluted" site, with respect to sulphur sources and concentration. Samples were collected monthly for a period of 18 months. [...] Multiple regression with periodic functions was used to model the observations. All lichens showed a gradual change in isotopic composition and concentration toward the values at the transplant site, but did not reach local conditions. No long-term trend was discernible for sulphur concentration measurements in lichens transplanted to the polluted site, probably due to a significant increase in sulphur concentrations at that site {{over the course of the}} experiment. Seasonal trends were identified at both sites, and at the polluted site appeared to be closely related to anthropogenic sulphur emission patterns. Some sources of seasonal variation at the unpolluted site were unidentifiable, but influences from anthropogenic sources were identified, and influences from biogenic sources suggested. The mechanics of relocation did not affect lichen responses. It is likely that distinguishing between the organic and <b>inorganic</b> fractions of <b>sulphur</b> would have helped in interpreting results...|$|R
