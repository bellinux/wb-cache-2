40|$|Abstract Background Recently, {{methods for}} {{measurement}} of dioxins {{in the blood}} have improved. Also, techniques for analyzing large quantities of data have been developed, such as data mining. Even in subjects with elusive characteristics, it is becoming possible to find previously unknown characteristics by checking all combinations of symptoms. Findings Using association {{analysis of the data}} mining technique, we extracted and compared combinations with a strong relationship between recent symptoms (2001 - 2004) and recent blood PeCDF levels, and between past symptoms (1986 - 1989) and recent PeCDF levels, in physical, blood, <b>dermatological,</b> <b>dental</b> <b>and</b> ophthalmological examinations. Patients with a higher PeCDF level were more likely to present with symptoms included in the diagnostic criteria, such as pigmentation. In addition, we obtained evidence that recent PeCDF levels had a stronger relationship with recent than past symptoms. Conclusions Recent PeCDF levels should not be compared directly with past symptoms. However, as the excretion rate of PeCDF has been constant, it is probable that PeCDF levels were higher in the past if recent PeCDF levels were also high. The study confirmed a relationship between past PeCDF levels and past clinical symptoms. For symptoms included in the diagnostic criteria, there was a stronger relationship between PeCDF levels and past symptoms than recent symptoms. Alleviation of symptoms in each patient or aging weakened the relationship between PeCDF levels and symptoms. </p...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Yusho an {{intoxication}} {{caused by}} oral dioxins and polychlorinated biphenyls occurred in 1968. Patients suffered from various systemic symptoms, including general fatigue, nausea, muscular and articular pain, acneform eruptions, black comedones, cutaneous and oral pigmentation, and increased eye discharge. The major causative factor was the contamination of rice oil with 2, 3, 4, 7, 8 -penta-chlorodibenzofuran (PeCDF). Recent technical advances have {{allowed us to}} measure blood levels of PeCDF. However, there is little information on which symptoms and laboratory data are directly associated with PeCDF levels. Methods Yusho patients underwent annual medical check-ups from 2001 to 2003. Blood PeCDF levels were correlated with {{the presence or absence}} of symptoms in medical, hematological, <b>dermatological,</b> <b>dental</b> <b>and</b> ophthalmological examinations. This study analyzed all combinations by using the association analysis. This is the most suitable method to evaluate all combinations of the data comprehensively. This method was used to determine the rate of patients with high PeCDF level in the population with each symptom, and to extract combinations of three symptoms which were strongly associated with high PeCDF level. Results and Conclusion The rate of the patients with high PeCDF level was high in populations with high uric acid, black comedones (face), second highest quartile of age, or high urea nitrogen. The combination of three symptoms associated with the highest rate of patients with high PeCDF level was "high uric acid, female sexuality, and history of acneform eruptions", followed by "history of Yusho in and after 1968, high cholesterol level, and subjective symptoms. " This analysis newly suggested that PeCDF concentration may be associated with history of dermatological symptoms, high uric acid, and elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate. </p...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyze quality of {{investigation}} and treatment in the specialized services – <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital and private health care institution “Medidermas”. Methods. Study population – patients with <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases. Randomly selected patients were interviewed in 2004 September-October. Totally 157 patients from state and 62 from private institution were investigated. MS Office Exel and EpiInfo 6. 0 packages were used in the statistical analysis. Results. Mean age of the investigated was 42. 5 ± 1. 1 yrs. One quarter of the investigated chose health care institution, recommended by familiar or friend, only 24 % applied to specialized departments with referrals. The majority of respondents (85. 5 %) of the private institution “Medidermas” were accepted after few days of registration, 38. 2 % (p< 0. 001) of the <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital were accepted after one or two weeks. 45. 2 % of the investigated in the private service were registered in the interval of 10 minutes, 43. 5 % - 15 minutes. In the state institution only 17. 8 % (p 0. 001) were registered during 10 minutes and half – 15 minutes. The respondents of “Medidermas” had a longer waiting time before acceptance to a medical doctor as compared to the state health care service (in 10 minutes 41. 9 % and 17. 3 %, p< 0. 001, respectively). 4 / 5 of the respondents of “Medidermas” had a visit to the doctor lasting 10 - 30 minutes, while 2 / 5 of patients of the state institution the visit to the doctor lasted only 10 - 15 minutes. 	The respondents in the private health care service institution were more satisfied with the interior order and keeping privacy as compared to the state health care institution. Female respondents of “Medidermas” were more satisfied with the competency of medical doctor, while male respondents were more satisfied in the state institution. Women with <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases in private institution preferred to accept positively the administered medication and their health status as compared to men and the respondents of the state health care institution. The majority of the respondents were satisfied with the facilities provided and the quality in health care, less satisfaction was documented among the patients in the <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital. Conclusions. The respondents of the private specialized institution “Medidermas” tended to be more satisfied with health care quality as compared to <b>dermatological</b> <b>and</b> sexually transmissible diseases outpatient department of the II Kaunas Clinical hospital...|$|R
