50|$|Studies on {{soil erosion}} suggest that {{increased}} rainfall amounts and intensities {{will lead to}} greater rates of soil erosion. Thus, if rainfall amounts and intensities increase {{in many parts of}} the world as expected, erosion will also increase, unless amelioration measures are taken. Soil erosion rates are expected to change in response to changes in climate for a variety of reasons. The most direct is the change in the erosive power of rainfall. Other reasons include: a) changes in plant canopy caused by shifts in plant biomass production associated with moisture regime; b) changes in litter cover on the ground caused by changes in both plant residue decomposition rates driven by temperature and moisture dependent soil microbial activity as well as plant biomass production rates; c) changes in soil moisture due to shifting precipitation regimes and evapo-transpiration rates, which changes infiltration and runoff ratios; <b>d)</b> <b>soil</b> erodibility changes due to decrease in soil organic matter concentrations in soils that lead to a soil structure that is more susceptible to erosion and increased runoff due to increased soil surface sealing and crusting; e) a shift of winter precipitation from non-erosive snow to erosive rainfall due to increasing winter temperatures; f) melting of permafrost, which induces an erodible soil state from a previously non-erodible one; and g) shifts in land use made necessary to accommodate new climatic regimes.|$|E

The concept of functional horizons {{is applied to}} the process of biological denitrification and 3 <b>D</b> <b>soil</b> horizon cartography is used to estimate its spatial variation. On one hand, detailed fieldwork (186 pedological auger holes) was undertaken to map 3 D horizon distribution within a 3 -ha riparian area using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). On the other hand, three classes of denitrifying capacities were defined according to the distribution of the denitrifying enzyme activity of 51 samples. The relationship between the process of denitrification and the cartography is assessed through soil characteristics, which both differentiate soil horizons and control the process of denitrification: organic carbon and textural fractions. This allows a class of denitrifying capacity to be attributed to each soil horizon. This information was inserted into the 3 <b>D</b> <b>soil</b> horizon cartography and the denitrifying functional horizons could be delimited. With this approach, field criteria are used and variations of the 3 D distribution of denitrification are considered in order to estimate the spatial variation of denitrification within the riparian area being studied...|$|E

The stability analysis of the three-dimensional (3 D) slope is essential to prevent landslides, but the most important and difficult problem is how to determine the 3 D critical slip surface with the minimum factor of safety in earth slopes. Basing on the slope stress field with the finite element method, a stability analysis method is proposed to determine the critical slip surface and the corresponding safety factor of 3 <b>D</b> <b>soil</b> slopes. Spherical and ellipsoidal slip surfaces are considered through the analysis. The moment equilibrium is used to compute the safety factor combined with the Mohr-Coulomb criteria and the limit equilibrium principle.

Simulated results indicate that the safety factor of the benchmark slope is 2. 14 using the spherical slip surface and 2. 19 using the ellipsoidal slip surface, which is close to the results of previous methods.

The efficacy of nitrification inhibitors such as dicyandiamide (DCD) {{is limited in}} soil due to biodegradation. This study investigated if the persistence of DCD could be sustained in soil by slow release from a chitosan hydrogel. DCD was encapsulated in glyoxal-crosslinked chitosan beads where excess glyoxal was (i) partly removed (C beads) or (ii) allowed to dry (CG beads). The beads were tested in water and in soil. The beads contained two fractions of DCD: one which was quickly released in water, and one which was not. A large DCD fraction within C beads was readily available: 84 % of total DCD bead content was released after 9 h immersion in water, while between 74 % and 98 % was released after 7 <b>d</b> in <b>soil</b> under low to high moisture conditions. A lower percentage of encapsulated DCD was readily released from CG beads: 19 % after 9 h in water, and 33 % after 7 <b>d</b> in <b>soil</b> under high rainfall conditions. Kinetic analysis indicated that the release in water occurred by quasi-Fickian diffusion. The results also suggest that DCD release was controlled by bead erosion and the leaching of glyoxal derivatives, predominantly a glyoxal-DCD adduct whose release {{was positively correlated with}} that of DCD (R 2 = 0. 99, p â©½ 0. 0001). Therefore, novel chitosan/glyoxal composite beads show a promising slow-release potential in soil for agrochemicals like DCD...|$|R
40|$|Soils are {{fundamental}} to ensuring water, energy and food security. Within {{the context of}} sus- tainable food production, {{it is important to}} share knowledge on existing and emerging tech- nologies that support land and soil monitoring. Technologies, such as remote sensing, mobile soil testing, and digital soil mapping, have the potential to identify degraded and non- /little-responsive soils, and may also provide a basis for programmes targeting the protection and rehabilitation of soils. In the absence of such information, crop production assessments are often not based on the spatio-temporal variability in soil characteristics. In addition, uncertain- ties in soil information systems are notable and build up when predictions are used for monitor- <b>ing</b> <b>soil</b> properties or biophysical modelling. Consequently, interpretations of model-based results have to be done cautiously. As such they provide a scientific, but not always manage- able, basis for farmers and/or policymakers. In general, the key incentives for stakeholders to aim for sustainable management of soils and more resilient food systems are complex at farm as well as higher levels. The same is true of drivers of soil degradation. The decision- making process aimed at sustainable soil management, be that at farm or higher level, also in- volves other goals and objectives valued by stakeholders, e. g. land governance, improved envi- ronmental quality, climate change adaptation and mitigation etc. In this dialogue session we will share ideas on recent developments in the discourse on soils, their functions and the role of soil and land information in enhancing food system resilience...|$|R
