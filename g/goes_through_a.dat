5|$|Odd Horten is an overcautious 67-year-old {{man about}} to retire after forty {{years as a}} train driver on the route between Oslo and Bergen. As he awakes, he <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> meticulous daily routine, as he prepares for his second-to-last time driving the train to Bergen.

The standard {{problem is the}} special case where the obstacles have infinite weight. This istermed as the weighted region problem in the literature.|$|R
5|$|Beyond the airport, Highway 82 turns due south. It {{bends to}} the {{southeast}} to cross the new Maroon Creek Bridge, with the original, listed on the National Register of Historic Places, immediately to its south. At this point, with a golf course on the north side, the Aspen city limit begins to follow the road, {{and by the time}} it <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> roundabout and passes the Holden/Marolt Mining and Ranching Museum to the south it is fully in the city of Aspen. Another stream crossing, Castle Creek, brings the highway into the developed portion of the city.|$|E
5|$|In the game, players take on {{the roles}} of {{spacecraft}} pilots. These characters fly single-seater ships, exploring the planets and space stations of 48 known star systems. They also engage in dogfights with other pilots (player- and computer-controlled) to protect traders or engage in piracy themselves. Other player activities include bounty-hunting and commodity trading. The single-player mode puts the player {{in the role of}} Edison Trent, who <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of missions to save the Sirius sector from a mysterious alien force. In multiplayer mode, players are free to take on any role and to explore anywhere from the start.|$|E
5|$|The bill then <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> third reading. At this stage, only {{amendments}} not of {{a material}} character may {{be made to the}} bill. The minister moving the third reading may also make a speech outlining the changes made to the bill. The bill is then put to the vote. In most cases, a simple majority of Parliament is all that is needed for the bill to be approved. However, bills seeking to amend the Constitution must be carried by a special majority: not less than two-thirds of all MPs on the second and third readings.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and go through a series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|The highway heads {{northeast}} into {{a wooded}} area from Sedona and follows Oak Creek as it enters Oak Creek Canyon. SR 89A then curves to the north as it follows the creek and provides access to Slide Rock State Park along {{this portion of the}} highway. The roadway leaves the creek as it begins to ascend through the canyon. Upon ascending, the road <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of hairpin turns (no trucks over 50ft.) towards the Mogollon Rim. The roadway continues northward away from the canyon towards Flagstaff. It curves northeastward as it passes {{to the west of the}} Forest Highlands Golf Club. The route continues to the northeast towards I-17 near Flagstaff Pulliam Airport. SR 89A begins to run concurrently with I-17 as a freeway northward. The two highways continue north to an interchange with I-40, where I-17 terminates. The route continues north along Milton Road, passing to the west of Northern Arizona University before reaching its northern terminus at I-40 Business in Flagstaff.|$|E
5|$|After {{the train}} departs from the station, it {{immediately}} begins {{to climb the}} vertical (90 degree) lift hill. Upon reaching {{the top of the}} lift, the train turns 45 degrees backwards putting the train and its riders in an upside down position. Then, as the train exits the lift, it <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> heartline roll before going down the only drop in the layout of the roller coaster. The train speeds through the station going back up the lift. Once it loses momentum the train then returns down passing through the station again. It then proceeds back up the drop and partially into the heartline roll before once again losing momentum and returning to the ground. After passing the station for the third time, the train is stopped {{near the top of the}} lift hill. It is then lowered back down to the station where the next riders board the train. The XT 150 has the option of sending riders around a second cycle at the operator's discretion. When the train stops on the lift hill at the end of the ride, instead of lowering slowly back to the station, the chain will raise the car up and send it through the ride again.|$|E

5|$|On {{his way to}} a meeting, Webber <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> red light, and collides {{with another}} vehicle, {{resulting}} in him becoming T-boned. Webber is taken to the neighboring Mercy West Hospital, where he is treated by former colleague Dr. Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), and subsequently discharged. Ferguson finally agrees to the surgery, after constant pleads from Lexie, and makes a start to physical therapy. Lexie returns home to see her sister Dr. Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo) and her new husband Dr. Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey) having sex in the kitchen. Dr. Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl) is at home, begging her husband Karev to spend time with her, but he dismisses her. At Dr. Mark Sloan (Eric Dane)'s apartment, his girlfriend Lexie has moved in, and his bisexual ex-girlfriend Torres walks in on Sloan in the shower. Lexie expresses her concern to Torres about doing this, and she apologizes. Robbins confronts Shepherd, the hospital's chief of neurosurgery, and asks him to run an expensive test to see if Andy has Tethered spinal cord syndrome, which reveals that he has it, and it is reversed through surgery. Stevens notices the girl Dr. George O'Malley (T.R. Knight) saved, Amanda (Shannon Lucio), sitting outside the hospital, and tells her to go get a life, because O'Malley did not save her so she could be miserable. At the conclusion of the episode, Stevens unites with Karev, and Webber announces that Seattle Grace will be merging with Mercy West.|$|E
5|$|The video {{begins with}} the younger version of Clarkson sitting at {{the back seat of}} a station wagon. Singing the first verse, she {{witnesses}} a depressing scene of her brother quarreling with her sister who are scolded by their mother. She slowly clasps both her hands before the video shifts to the present day where Clarkson is seen arriving on the red carpet with her publicist for the world premiere of The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement. After posing for the photographers, she enters the cinema and watches the film. The next scene switches back to the younger Clarkson who is sitting and looking around her neighborhood at her house's rooftop as a plane is seen flying across the sky. The video switches back to the older Clarkson who is now watching the aforementioned film in her laptop inside the plane as it <b>goes</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> mild turbulence. Clarkson is also seen reminiscing about her past job as a worker in a movie theater, singing with her co-workers. The next scene shows Clarkson singing with her band in a backyard party which is shown alternately with scenes from the film, as well as a montage of her family and co-workers waving away from her. In the final scene, the younger Clarkson is shown praying by her bedside.|$|E

However, Ezra tries to force himself on Terese and is fired from Lassiter's. When he tries to sue Paul and Terese, Paul pays Gary Canning (Damien Richardson) to attack Ezra. When Gary confesses to the police, Paul gives him more money to keep quiet about their arrangement. Paul hires Naomi to organise the Erinsborough Festival, two weeks of events celebrating the suburb. Hilary Robinson returns and convinces Paul to reinstate some of the community services. Paul tries to stop Daniel and Amber's wedding by sending Amber away on a photography trip and planning for her flight to be cancelled, so she will not make the wedding. He also asks Des Clarke (Paul Keane) to talk to Daniel about the dangers of marrying the wrong person. Imogen Willis (Ariel Kaplan) forces Paul to bring Amber back, but he realises Imogen loves Daniel and tells Amber. Daniel fails to appear for the wedding after he goes looking for Imogen.
