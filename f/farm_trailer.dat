50|$|This Bison {{had been}} used by the Home Guard to defend RAF Digby. Later in the war, Digby was {{downgraded}} and hence the additional airfield protection was not required. It was for a while stored at Ferrybridge, Yorkshire and it was used to defend a roadblock on the A15 just outside Sleaford. Towards {{the end of the war}} it was abandoned in a copse to the side of the A15 near Quarington Lane end. The ensuing years saw it stripped and vandalised until eventually the chassis was converted for use as a <b>farm</b> <b>trailer.</b> In 1988, the Lincolnshire Aircraft Recovery Group learned of its existence of these remains and research revealed what it really was.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The paper {{presents}} {{analysis of}} equipment with the machinery park in 30 ecologi-cal farms. Area of arable land {{was accepted as}} a grouping variable. Activities related to inte-gration of our country with the European Union constituted the second aspect of the paper. In order to fully realize the accepted objective of the paper, replacement value of the machinery park, which was at the average 16. 44 thousand PLN. ha- 1 AL, was calculated. Quantitative machinery equipment proved that each examined farm possessed inter alia one tractor and a <b>farm</b> <b>trailer</b> as a transport mean. Characteristics of tractors proved that {{they were at the}} av-erage 16 years old and their average power was of 5. 91 kW. ha- 1 AL. 24 out od 30 responders, declared that they additionally used available subsidies within structural funds both pre-accession and after integration with the EU.

500|$|Proposals for the South Beltline Freeway {{were nearly}} 25years old {{by the time}} initial {{construction}} was started in 1997. The Michigan State Legislature named the South Beltline {{around the same time}} for the Congressman Paul B. Henry, who died in office in 1993, serving in Gerald Ford's old US House seat. The cost of the construction of new roads like the South Beltline was a campaign issue when Engler ran for re-election against Geoffrey Feiger in 1998. The entire freeway was projected to open by 2008, with the first phase opening in 2002. MDOT gave the South Beltline its numerical designation on the July 1999 edition of the state map, marking M-6 {{for the first time as}} a dotted line, to denote it was [...] "under construction". The legislature approved Engler's [...] "Build Michigan III" [...] program in 2000; the plan accelerated road projects in the state. The capital outlay for the year was $82 million (equivalent to $ in [...] ). [...] Condemnation proceedings were initiated in the Kent County Circuit Court in 1999 to clear the way for the acquisitions. Land that contained homes, <b>farms,</b> <b>trailer</b> parks, and businesses was purchased by MDOT to acquire the right-of-way needed for the freeway.

40|$|AbstractTurkey {{is one of}} the few {{countries}} in the World which are self-sufficient in food. Total tractor number was 1 125 001 for 2011. Number of tractor power ranged between 50 - 70 HP is 422 389. Total combine number is 14 313. 4148 of the are older than 20 years. This situation causes increasing harvesting losses.

Turkey's agricultural mechanization indicators are 56. 25 tractor/ 1000 ha, 2. 42 kW/ha, 17. 78 ha/tractor, 444. 65 tractor/ 1000 tract/ha. Agricultural mechanization indicators of Turkey are better than their neighbours, except Greece. However, Turkey is behind the developed countries according to the agricultural mechanization indicatorsThere are 13 tractors manufacturer and more than 1000 agricultural machinery manufacturers in Turkey. Export of tractor and agricultural equipment and machinery in Turkey gradually increases and contribute to the economy of the country. Despite a strong Tractor manufacturers firms, there are many small agricultural machinery manufacturers. Agricultural mechanization problems may vary due to regions but main agricultural mechanization problems are; small scale and fragmented farming, unnecessary tractor and agricultural machinery selection, Lack of knowledge on effective and proper usage, maintenance of tractor and agricultural machineries and old combine and tractor Park. Agricultural mechanization policies of Turkey must help farmers to buy agricultural machineries which need less energy for improving yield and quality. In addition, control systems for preventing excessive inputs and yield monitors etc. will also be supported by policy makers to protect environment...|$|R

50|$|A dead axle, {{also called}} a lazy axle, {{is not part}} of the drivetrain, but is instead free-rotating. The rear axle of a front-wheel drive car is usually a dead axle. Many trucks and {{trailers}} use dead axles for strictly load-bearing purposes. A dead axle located immediately in front of a drive axle is called a pusher axle. A tag axle is a dead axle situated behind a drive axle. Dead axles are also found on semi <b>trailers,</b> <b>farm</b> equipment, and certain heavy construction machinery serving the same function. On some vehicles (such as motorcoaches), the tag axle may be steerable. In some designs the wheels on a lazy axle only come into contact with ground when the load is significant, thus saving unnecessary tire wear.|$|R
5000|$|The {{primacy of}} figure {{painting}} {{in his work}} is manifest in his [...] "Artists & Models Series" [...] (late 1990s-2008); portraits of iconic artists and their subjects. Single and group portraits of both the famous and the obscure populate his oeuvre, from Pope John Paul II to anonymous nursing graduates, family snaps, a Native American tribe, and his noted 'Convention Pictures'; monumental group portraits of corporate and civic gatherings captured on a cinematic scale. Stout's work ruminates on themes of the Individual and Society 10, and the passing of time.His images of intimacy and of anonymity in 20th-21st century culture are rendered with a sensitive, but dispassionate eye, covering a spectrum of moods from the melancholic to the ridiculous. Portraits of Doris Day and D.W. Griffiths' golden age of Hollywood are juxtaposed with winos, and landscapes of decaying New England cinemas, Masonic lodges, abandoned <b>farms,</b> factories, <b>trailers,</b> and fast food outlets.Where Photo Realists and Pop Realists assert a coolly ironic stance towards similar imagery 11, Stout expresses {{an interest in the}} psychological and emotional character of his subjects as well as their graphic/optical attributes. Where the former use flatness and color to achieve a sense of distance, Stout uses light and pigment to create illusionistic depth and engagement.A sense of restlessness and transience haunt Stout's depopulated landscapes, while the faces in his portraits convey a complicity and bafflement about their roles in the occasions captured. Stout's wide-ranging subject matter forms an additive portrait of contemporary society in transition; moments frozen within a broader, uncertain human narrative. 14.|$|R
40|$|Polistes dominula (Christ, 1791) (Fig. 1) is a Palearctic paper wasp {{that was}} {{discovered}} in eastern North America near Boston, Massachusetts in the late 1970 s (Hathaway 1981). This species has spread westward into various Canadian provinces and several states within the U. S. (see Cervo et al. 2000; Hoebeke and Wheeler 2005; Liebert et al. 2006; Buck et al. 2008 and references therein). The range of P. dominula has expanded westward to at least the Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area in eastern Minnesota (Liebert et al. 2006). A second distinct front of P. dominula originated along the Pacific coast of North America (Landolt and Antonelli 1999; Borkent and Cannings 2004) and has extended into the western interior of the U. S. (Buck et al. 2008; Liebert et al. 2006). Polistes dominula has a proclivity for nesting in and around human shelters, and in cavities provided by items such as <b>farm</b> implements, machinery, <b>trailers,</b> and recreational equipment (Silagi et al. 2003). Thus, P. dominula is likely to follow patterns of human habitation and activity, and to continue to expand its range in North America (Cervo et al. 2000; Silagi et al. 2003). In this paper, I document the first record of the adventive Palearctic P. dominula nesting in South Dakota...|$|R
50|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{ambulances}} and 10 fire engines attended the accident. The first ambulance arrived at Marden station at 21:06. Ambulances from Ashford, the Medway Towns and Southborough attended. The fire engines came from Ashford, Cranbrook, Maidstone, Marden, Matfield, Tonbridge and Tunbridge Wells. The {{site of the}} accident was difficult for the emergency services to reach, with the darkness and fog contributing to this. David Winch, the farm manager at Brook Farm, Marden, and his staff provided access by using <b>farm</b> tractors hauling <b>trailers</b> across two ploughed fields. Rescuers were transported to the site, and the passengers {{were taken from the}} site to waiting ambulances. The WRVS set up a field kitchen to provide hot food and drink to the rescuers. The driver of the passenger train and three passengers had been killed in the collision. All the injured had been freed from the wreckage by 23:37. The last of the deceased was not removed until 08:55 on 7 January. Eleven passengers were taken to hospital. Of those, nine were admitted, with eight having been discharged by the end of January and the ninth being discharged on 1 April. Two people were seriously injured; one losing his left arm and the other with a broken back. For his part in the rescue operation, Stanley Skinner, who was the officer in charge of the ambulances at the scene, was awarded the British Empire Medal. All the injured were taken to the West Kent Hospital, Maidstone, apart from one person who was taken by a passing motorist to Ashford Hospital.|$|R
5000|$|The road {{takes one}} last drop, only to rise again and officially enter Ridge Manor at the {{intersection}} of Kettering Road and Croom-Rital Road which leads to a trailhead for the Withlacoochee State Trail US 98-SR 50 pass under a bridge for this trail. At the crossing over the Withlacoochee River, two former sections of the road exist {{on the east side of}} the river; Paul N. Steckle Lane, and Ridge Manor Boulevard. The shorter Paul N. Steckle Lane exists on the north side and contains a Hernando County Firehouse, local residences, and one entrance to the Cypress Lake Preserve. Ridge Manor Boulevard begins on the south side, and crosses over to the north side east of the firehouse and west of the Hernando County Eastside Solid Waste Convenience Station. When SR 50 continues east and narrows down to two lanes toward Clermont, Orlando, and Titusville, US 98 turns southeast and also narrows down to two lanes even as it crosses the Withlacoohcee River for the second time, this time at the Hernando-Pasco County Line, entering Trilby. The first major intersection is a blinker-light intersection with County Road 575, but a far more important one is with US 301 in Trilacoochee, where it shares yet another concurrency running south. South of this point, US 98-301 passes by the Owensboro Junction Trailhead, of the Withlacoochee State Trail. This was once a former junction between the Atlantic Coast Line and Seaboard Air Line Railroads, until both were merged into the Seaboard Coast Line and the segments that crossed Routes 98 and 301 were abandoned. From that point, the road runs up and down a series of hills where it passes by some small motels, local auto repair shops, <b>trailer</b> parks, <b>farms,</b> a Moose Lodge, a local golf course, and a drive-in movie theater. The road officially enters Dade City in the vicinity of the aforementioned drive-in theater, and passes by the Pioneer Florida Museum right next to a former citrus plant. Across from the south end of that plant is the intersection with eastern County Road 578, and shortly afterwards veers to the left at an at-grade interchange onto the former US 98-301 Truck Bypass, which was converted into mainline US 98-301 in 2007. The former segment of US 98-301 is now SR 39 as well as hidden state routes hidden SRs 35-700 and runs into downtown Dade City. US 98-301 moves closer to the CSX Wildwood Subdivision (part of the S-Line), where it encounters the eastern terminus of SR 52 and the Dade City Atlantic Coast Line Railroad Depot. At County Road 35 Alternate, US 98-301 turns from southeast to southwest as it moves back towards another at-grade interchange with the former [...] "Business" [...] US 98-301, and runs straight south again onto a four-lane divided highway. After the intersection with County Road 52 Alternate in Clinton Heights, US 98 branches off to the southeast taking hidden SR 35 and 700 with it, while US 301(SR 39) continues south towards Zephyrhills, Hillsborough River State Park, and eventually the Manatee-Bradenton-Sarasota area. The road climbs various hills, and includes random <b>farms</b> and <b>trailer</b> parks. The road has another encounter with both CR ALT 35 and the Wildwood Subdivision near Ellerslie, at a bridge over both, and an unnumbered interchange with the former of these two. Continuing southeast, the road encounters fewer farms and approaches the western edges of the Green Swamp, where it encounters the northernmost bridge over the Hillsborough River, which is nothing more than an elevated culvert. At the Pasco-Polk County Line, the road becomes the eastern terminus of County Road 54, and then the southern terminus of State Road 471.|$|R
