40|$|Maltose <b>fermentation</b> <b>activator</b> protein, MAL 63 homologue, MAL 63 (NCYC 1006), was cloned from S. cerevisiae NCYC 1006. This yeast strain is top-fermenting yeast, and ferments maltose very well. Laboratory yeast S. cerevisiae YNN 27 ferments maltose very poorly, {{however, the}} {{transformant}} with MAL 63 (NCYC 1006) could ferment maltose very well. Genome sequencing by a next generation sequencer revealed the chromosomal location of MAL 63 (NCYC 1006). These typical chromosomal structures are conserved among top-fermenting yeast strains and bottom-fermenting yeast strain...|$|E

MAL 63 (NCYC 1006) has zinc-finger motif, which is transcriptional activation motif. It is inferred that MAL 63 (NCYC 1006) {{is located on}} chromosome VII. There are variations of maltose fermenting gene family among inter-Saccharomyces strains and intra-Saccharomyces strain genomes...|$|E
