40|$|Mestrado em Engenharia do Ambiente - Tecnologias Ambientais - Instituto Superior de AgronomiaDetergents are {{substances}} or preparations containing soaps {{or other}} surfactants intend for water based laundry or dishwashing processes. Detergents {{may be used}} in any form (liquid, powder, paste, bar, cake, shape, etc,) widely for household laundry products, domestic and industrial cleaners, cosmetic products, and industrial purposes. Surfactants are organic substances, used in detergents, intentionally added to achieve cleaning, rising and/or fabric softening due to its surface-active properties. They consist of one or more hydrophilic and hydrophobic groups of such nature and size that they are capable of forming micelles. Surfactants belong to a group of chemicals of high environment relevance due to their large production volumes. They are mainly discharged into the environment by the wastewater pathway, either after treatment in a wastewater treatment plant or directly where no treatment is available. Environmental compartments, which may be influenced by surfactants, are the fresh water environment (water body and sediments), the soil if surfactants loaded sewage sludge is added, and the marine environment. The wastewaters of detergent manufacturing contain high levels of inhibitory surfactants that pose appreciable impacts on the environment. In addition to industrial wastewaters, domestic wastewater also includes synthetic organic compounds like surfactants, personal-care products, additives that have severe effects on wildlife and human health due to their toxicological properties. Therefore there is a growing research need on the inhibitory effects and removal of such compounds. Linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> (LAS) and sodium lauryl ether sulphate (SLES) {{play an important role in}} our everyday, since they have been announced as biodegradable and environmentally friendly surfactants compared to branched <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> like Dodecyl <b>Benzene</b> <b>Sulphonates.</b> LAS are known as biodegradable due to the linear structure of the alkyl benzene group present in this molecular structure. However, it has also been reported that surfactants, specifically linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonates</b> decrease the affinity of substrate to biomass and lower maximum growth rates are observed in the presence of surfactants. Sodium lauryl ether sulphate consists of straight carbon chains, usually 12 to 14, and, due to its more simple structure (i. e., no benzene ring), it can be more easily biodegradable than other surfactants such as LAS. Biodegradation is an important factor for reduction and removal of organic contaminants from the environment. The evaluation of biodegradability of anthropogenic organic substances is an essential parameter for environmental risk assessment and required according to appropriate legislation. In a risk assessment study it has been pointed out that the risk imposed on the aquatic by the anionic surfactants depends upon the applied treatment scheme prior to discharge of wastewater. [...] RESUMO O presente trabalho foi desenvolvido numa indústria de produtos de limpeza doméstica (LD) e higiene pessoal (HP), onde está implementada uma estação de tratamento de águas residuais industriais (ETARI). Durante o estudo foi monitorizada e avaliada a biodegradabilidade de algumas substâncias base dos detergentes (tensoactivos aniónicos), nomeadamente o LAS e o SLES, bem como o efluente da indústria nas diferentes fases de tratamento implementado na ETARI. Ao longo do processo de tratamento dos fluxos que compõem as águas residuais industriais, procurou-se estabelecer relações entre parâmetros chave de avaliação do conteúdo em matéria orgânica (Carência Química Oxigénio – CQO e Carência Bioquímica Oxigénio – CBO) com os tensoactivos anteriormente referidos.

The {{effective and efficient}} use of detergents in cleaning process, was attracted {{to be used in}} laundry’s industry commercially, though, it has some drawback to the society and environments. Since the active materials in the compounds can cause irritating to the skins, cataracts to mature eyes and some other environmental issues due to the excess of foams can prevent oxygen dilution in the water so it be hazardous to water living organisms. Once the promising method to solve this problem is by photo-degradation using photo-catalyst. Photo-catalyst is the process using light and catalyst in order to accelerate chemical transformation, thus,  solar or uv-rays can be used as light sources. This research aims at to show the ability of catalyst TiO 2  to degrade active material in linear alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (LAS) and alkyl <b>benzene</b> <b>sulphonate</b> (ABS) which is available in commercial detergent. Photo-degradation of LAS and ABS compounds was determined by optimum capacity TiO 2  and irradiance time. Whereas, for environmental application, the degrade compounds such Rinso® and Wipol® was chosen since it is commonly used in daily life. Beside, artificial water waste and laundry water was chosen to show the environmental effect.   The result shows that the optimum number of catalyst TiO 2  addition for LAS degradation was 1. 5 g, and optimum time was 120 minute. Whereas  the optimum number of catalyst TiO 2  addition for ABS degradation was 2. 0 g, and optimum time was 120 minute as well. Thus, for detergent Rinso®, at optimum catalyst addition, we found degradation number was 75. 83 %, and for detergent Wipol®, at optimum catalyst addition, we found degradation number was 57. 94 %.
