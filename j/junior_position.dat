5|$|The newly {{appointed}} commander of this troubled fleet was Villaret de Joyeuse; although formerly in a <b>junior</b> <b>position,</b> {{he was known}} to possess a high degree of tactical ability; he had trained under Admiral Pierre André de Suffren in the Indian Ocean during the American war. However, Villaret's attempts to mould his new officer corps into an effective fighting unit were hampered by another new appointee, a deputy of the National Convention named Jean-Bon Saint-André. Saint-André's job was to report directly to the National Convention on the revolutionary ardour of both the fleet and its admiral. He frequently intervened in strategic planning and tactical operations. Shortly after his arrival, Saint-André proposed issuing a decree ordering that any officer deemed to have shown insufficient zeal in defending his ship in action should be put to death on his return to France, although this highly controversial legislation {{does not appear to have}} ever been acted upon. Although his interference was a source of frustration for Villaret, Saint-André's dispatches to Paris were published regularly in Le Moniteur, and did much to popularise the Navy in France.|$|E

25|$|Workers do {{not engage}} in any formal {{religious}} training. Overseers pair new workers with senior companions until they are deemed ready to move beyond a <b>junior</b> <b>position.</b> The workers are assigned new companions annually. Workers organize and assign members to the home meetings, appoint elders, and decide controversies among members. Workers are not registered marriage celebrants, so members are married by secular functionaries (such as a justice of the peace). However, workers will give sermons and prayers at members' weddings if requested, and they officiate at the funerals of members.|$|E

25|$|The films usually {{involved}} the Gump character, usually called Norman, in a manual occupation {{in which he}} is barely competent and in a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> to a straight man, often played by Edward Chapman (as Mr Grimsdale) or Jerry Desmonde. They benefited from Wisdom's capacity for physical slapstick comedy and his skill at creating a sense of the character's helplessness. The series often contained a romantic subplot; the Gump's inevitable awkwardness with women is a characteristic shared with the earlier Formby vehicles. His innocent incompetence still made him endearing to the heroine.|$|E
25|$|He {{was given}} {{assistance}} {{getting a job}} at London Weekend Television (LWT) by fellow ex-Newcastle journalist Nicholas Evans, {{who was at the}} time working on Weekend World. Dyke got a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> on LWT's local politics programme, in the current affairs department. His bosses there were John Birt and Peter Jay. He attracted attention for trying to give the programmes he worked on a more populist edge. This led to him being given the chance to launch a new early evening current affairs topical news programme. This became The Six O'Clock Show, fronted by Michael Aspel, with co-hosts Danny Baker and Janet Street-Porter. The show is seen by many as the first example of British tabloid TV.|$|E

This led to an unusually bitter fall-out, and Mr Besson writing a book titled Qui connaît Madame Royal ? (Who knows Mrs Royal?), published on 20 March. In it, Besson accuses Royal of being a populist, an authoritarian and a luddite and says {{that he will not}} vote for her and hopes that she is not elected. He then went on to join the Sarkozy campaign and was rewarded with a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> in the next government on 18 May 2007.|$|E

He was the elected president of Karachi Municipality for 1911–1921, and before that he was elected as member of Municipality in 1888. As mayor of Karachi, he oversaw a major beautification project which involved development of new roads, parks, residential and recreational areas.

She is the {{daughter}} of Ted Archer, a prominent unionist with the Shop, Distributive and Allied Employees Association and Australian Workers' Union. She worked in several government departments throughout the 1980s, and was the cause of some controversy when she was promoted from a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> with the Office of the Parliamentary Secretary in the Department of Premier and Cabinet to a much more senior position with the state Office of Industrial Relations in 1989. It was during this time, in 1990, that she began a relationship with unionist Kevin Reynolds, whom she later married. She was subsequently sacked by the OIR in 1992 after being tried and convicted on 35 counts of welfare fraud, and unsuccessfully appealed the decision to the state Industrial Relations Commission. The conviction was later declared spent in 2002, after the requisite ten-year period had passed.|$|E

In addition, for Harrison, while he began to match Lennon and Paul McCartney as a songwriter {{towards the end of the}} group's career, his relatively <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> in the Beatles was a source of frustration to him, which, according to music journalist Mikal Gilmore, left [...] "deep and lasting wounds".|$|E

500|$|Lieutenant-Colonel Thomas Edward Knowles Stansfield, CBE (born 1862; died 19 February 1939) was a British {{pathologist}} {{of mental}} illnesses and a medical officer. The {{son of a}} leather merchant hailing from a Todmorden family, Stansfield trained in medicine at the University of Edinburgh and graduated in 1889 with an MB and an interest in pathology. Shortly afterwards he took up a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> at London County Council's Banstead Asylum, where he set about improving working practices and establishing a laboratory. He rose quickly through the ranks, and in 1893 was appointed Senior Assistant Medical Officer at the new Claybury Asylum.

500|$|Wodehouse {{expected}} to follow Armine to the University of Oxford, but the family's finances took {{a turn for the}} worse at the crucial moment. Ernest Wodehouse had retired in 1895, and his pension was paid in rupees; fluctuation against the pound reduced its value in Britain. Wodehouse recalled, [...] "The wolf was not actually whining at the door and there was always a little something in the kitty for the butcher and the grocer, but the finances would not run to anything in the nature of a splash". Instead of a university career, in September 1900 Wodehouse was engaged in a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> in the London office of the Hongkong and Shanghai Bank. He was unsuited to it and found the work baffling and uncongenial. He later wrote a humorous account of his experiences at the bank, but at the time he longed for the end of each working day, when he could return to his rented lodgings in Chelsea and write. At first he concentrated, with some success, on serious articles about school sports for Public School Magazine. In November 1900 his first comic piece, [...] "Men Who Missed Their Own Weddings," [...] was accepted by Tit-Bits. A new magazine for boys, The Captain, provided further well-paid opportunities, and during his two years at the bank, Wodehouse had eighty pieces published in a total of nine magazines.|$|E
2500|$|When {{pressure}} on unification started to mount Arellano again sided with Rodezno; by some scholars he is even considered co-leader of the Rodeznistas, pressing compliance and advocating the Carlist entry {{into a new}} partido unico. During charged meetings of February, March and April he enjoyed [...] "voz cantante" [...] when pushing the intransigent Fal into minority. Conscious of Carlist <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> within the coalition, he argued that sacrifice of the Requeté should not be wasted by allowing total Falangist predomination in a new monopolist state party. Even in case its program {{had little to do}} with Traditionalist ideario, he calculated that after the war Carlism would regain the lost ground. Apparently he did not realize the terms of forthcoming amalgamation; in the last-minute attempt as representative of Carlist labor structure Obra Nacional Corporativa Arellano was delegated to negotiate unification conditions.|$|E

2500|$|When Stephen Harper became Prime Minister on February 6, 2006, he did {{not include}} any Ministers of State in his cabinet. Derek Burney, the head of Harper's {{transition}} team, noted to the press that this was intentional: Ministers of State {{and the role of}} Deputy Prime Minister were omitted to create a cabinet of full equals. In actuality, Harper did appoint a number of Ministers of State in order to give certain ministers responsibilities outside of their portfolios, however all of these Ministers of States were also full Cabinet ministers and their formal titles were styled such as to omit [...] "of state". On January 4, 2007, Harper added five Secretaries of State to his ministry thus reviving the practice of appointing junior ministers outside of the Cabinet. On October 30, 2008, Harper added 11 Ministers of State to his Cabinet. On January 4, 2011, Harper added one Minister of State to his Cabinet to a total of 12. In 2015, the 29th cabinet led by Justin Trudeau, formed and updated several ministries including the formation of Minister of Sport and Persons with Disabilities from the previous <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> Minister of State (Sport).|$|E
2500|$|Hume {{appears to}} have planned a {{comprehensive}} work on the birds of India around 1870 and this [...] "forthcoming comprehensive work" [...] finds mention in the second edition of The Cyclopaedia of India (1871) by his cousin Edward Balfour. Hume made several expeditions solely to study ornithology the largest being an expedition to the Indus area in late November 1871 and continued {{until the end of}} February 1872. In March 1873, he visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal along with geologists Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka and Dr. Dougall of the Geological Survey of India and James Wood-Mason of the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1875, he made an expedition to the Laccadive Islands aboard the marine survey vessel IGS Clyde under the command of Staff-Commander Ellis. The official purpose of the visit being to examine proposed sites for lighthouses. During this expedition Hume collected many bird specimens, apart from conducting a bathymetric survey to determine whether the island chain was separated from India by a deep canyon. And in 1881 he made his last ornithological expedition to Manipur, a visit in which he collected and described the Manipur bush quail (Perdicula manipurensis), a bird that has remained obscure with few reliable reports since. Hume spent an extra day with his assistants cutting down a large tract of grass so that he could obtain specimens of this species. This expedition was made on special leave following his demotion from the Central Government to a <b>junior</b> <b>position</b> on the Board of Revenue of the North Western Provinces. Apart from personal travel, he also sent out a trained bird-skinner to accompany officers travelling in areas of ornithological interest such as Afghanistan. Around 1878 he was spending about ₤ 1500 a year on his ornithological surveys.|$|E
