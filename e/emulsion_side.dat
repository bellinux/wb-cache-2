5000|$|A {{contact print}} is a {{photographic}} image produced from film; sometimes from a film negative, and sometimes from a film positive. In a darkroom an exposed and developed piece of photographic film is placed <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> down, {{in contact with}} a piece of photographic paper, light is briefly shone through the negative and then the paper is developed to reveal the final print.|$|E
50|$|To use sheet film, the {{photographer}} places {{a sheet of}} film, <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> out, into a film holder in the dark, and closes the dark slide over the loaded film. Next, the holder is inserted into a large-format camera, and the dark slide {{is removed from the}} holder. The exposure is made, the dark slide is replaced, and the film holder is removed from the camera.|$|E
50|$|In photography, a {{dark slide}} is a wooden or metal plate {{that covers the}} {{sensitized}} <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> of a photographic plate. In use, a pair of plates joined back to back were used with both plates covered with a dark slide. When used, the dark slide is removed {{for the period of}} the exposure and then replaced. Modern dark slides are used in conjunction with a film holder, that either holds in place pieces of cut sheet film or, if modified, some piece of light sensitive material such as glass.|$|E

50|$|Film {{optimized}} for sensing X-ray radiation {{is commonly used}} for medical imaging by placing the subject between the film {{and a source of}} X-rays, without a lens, as if a translucent object were imaged by being placed between a light source and standard film. Unlike other types of film, X-ray film has a sensitive <b>emulsion</b> on both <b>sides</b> of the carrier material. This reduces the X-ray exposure for an acceptable image - a desirable feature in medical radiography. The film is usually placed in contact with a thin layer of lead which also enhances its sensitivity.|$|R
50|$|Kodachrome {{films are}} non-{{substantive}}. Unlike substantive transparency and negative color films, Kodachrome films did not incorporate dye couplers into the emulsion layers. The dye couplers were added during processing. This means that Kodachrome emulsion layers are thinner and less light is scattered upon exposure, {{meaning that the}} film could record an image with more sharpness than substantive films. Transparencies made with non-substantive films have an easily visible relief image on the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> of the film. Kodachrome films have a dynamic range of around 12 stops, or 3.6-3.8D.|$|E
5000|$|Sheet {{films have}} notches cut into one short side. This makes it simple to {{determine}} which side is the emulsion, when the film is hidden from sight (in the darkroom, or inside a changing bag). When holding the sheet in [...] "portrait" [...] orientation (short side up), with the notches in the upper right, the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> is facing the photographer. The notch patterns vary in size and layout; each type of film has its own distinct pattern, {{commonly referred to as}} a notch code, to enable film type identification.|$|E
5000|$|Riso {{film is a}} Japanese {{silk screen}} product {{composed}} of a Saran-type plastic that has been bonded to a screen mesh of various sizes. When the Riso film is exposed to the infrared bulb inside the machine, the saran plastic <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> opens up wherever there is an ink toner on the photocopy. Paint and other mediums can then be screened once the film is mounted on a frame. The imaging barrel inside the Thermofax is 8.5" [...] wide, but the film can be of any length. These modern uses have kept up the demand {{for most of the}} models of Thermofax machines.|$|E

For a purpose of studying the healing {{action of the}} fir oil emulsion the action of 5 -, 10 -, 25 - and 50 %-emulsion has been investigated {{on the model of}} the purulent wound on the rat. The comparative investigation with such known healing agents as the chlorophyllipt and chloromycol has been performed. The antimicrobic, allergic and irritant action of the fir oil preparations and also their influence on the growth of the cells in the culture and synthesis of the protein in the wound have been determined.

40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] To {{compare the}} tolerance, efficacy, and {{pharmacokinetics}} of amphotericin deoxycholate (Fungizone) prepared in a parenteral fat emulsion (Intralipid 20 %) or glucose in HIV patients with candidiasis. DESIGN [...] Non-blind randomised controlled trial. SETTING [...] University hospital; tertiary clinical care. PATIENTS [...] 22 HIV positive patients with oral candidiasis. INTERVENTIONS [...] Amphotericin 1 mg/kg/day given on four consecutive {{days as a}} one hour infusion dissolved in either 5 % glucose (amphotericin-glucose) or parenteral fat emulsion at a final concentration of 2 g/l fat emulsion (amphotericin-fat emulsion). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES [...] Clinical tolerance (fever, chills, sweats, nausea, arterial pressure, and pulse rate); biological tolerance (serum creatinine, electrolyte, and magnesium values); clinical score of candidiasis; and serum concentrations of amphotericin. RESULTS [...] 11 patients were enrolled in each group. All the amphotericin-fat emulsion infusions were given without serious problem whereas four amphotericin-glucose infusions were stopped because of renal impairment (n = 3) or severe chills (n = 2), or both. For patients completing the amphotericin-glucose treatment creatine concentration increased by 42 mumol/l; four of seven patients {{had at least one}} creatinine value > or = 133 mumol/l versus one of 11 receiving amphotericin-fat emulsion. Magnesium concentration fell significantly with amphotericin-glucose but not with amphotericin-fat <b>emulsion.</b> Clinical <b>side</b> effects were noted in 36 / 38 infusions with amphotericin-glucose but 10 / 44 with amphotericin-fat emulsion. Oral candidiasis score was reduced similarly in both groups. Serum amphotericin concentrations were significantly lower and the volume of distribution of the drug higher after infusion of amphotericin-fat emulsion than after amphotericin-glucose. CONCLUSIONS [...] Clinical and renal toxicity of amphotericin are reduced when the drug is prepared in fat emulsion. Preparation is simple and cost effective. Its efficacy {{is similar to that of}} conventional amphotericin...|$|R
2500|$|Despite a {{contract}} with MGM to distribute his cartoons, {{and the introduction of}} a new character named “Flip the Frog”, and later “Willie Whopper”, the Iwerks Studio was never a major commercial success and failed to rival either Disney or Fleischer Studios. [...] Newly-hired animator Fred Kopietz recommended that Iwerks employ a friend from Chouinard Art School, Chuck Jones, who was hired and put [...] to work as a cel washer. [...] The Flip and Willie cartoons were later distributed on the home-movie market by Official Films in the 1940s. From 1933 to 1936, he produced a series of shorts (independently distributed, not part of the MGM deal) in Cinecolor, named ComiColor Cartoons. The ComiColor series mostly focused on fairy tales with no continuing character or star. Later in the 1940s, this series would receive home-movie distribution by Castle Films. Cinecolor produced the 16 mm prints for Castle Films with red <b>emulsion</b> on one <b>side</b> and blue <b>emulsion</b> on the other. Later in the 1970s Blackhawk Films released these for home use, but this time using conventional Eastmancolor film stock. They are now in the public domain and are available on VHS and DVD. He also experimented with stop-motion animation in combination with the multiplane camera, and made a short called The Toy Parade, which was never released in public. In 1936, backers withdrew financial support from the Iwerks Studio, and it folded soon after.|$|R
50|$|One {{side of a}} clean {{glass plate}} was coated with {{a thin layer of}} iodized collodion, then dipped in a silver nitrate solution. The plate was exposed in the camera while still wet. Exposure times varied from five to sixty seconds or more {{depending}} on the brightness of the lighting and the speed of the camera lens. The plate was then developed and fixed. The resulting negative, when viewed by reflected light against a black background, appears to be a positive image: the clear areas look black, and the exposed, opaque areas appear relatively light. This effect was integrated by backing the plate with black velvet; by taking the picture on a plate made of dark reddish-colored glass (the result was called a ruby ambrotype); or by coating one side of the plate with black varnish. Either the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> or the bare side could be coated: if the bare side was blackened, the thickness of the glass added a sense of depth to the image. In either case, another plate of glass was put over the fragile <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> to protect it, and the whole was mounted in a metal frame and kept in a protective case. In some instances the protective glass was cemented directly to the emulsion, generally with a balsam resin. This protected the image well but tended to darken it. Ambrotypes were sometimes hand-tinted; untinted ambrotypes are monochrome, gray or tan in their lightest areas.|$|E
50|$|Wet gate {{printing}} {{eliminates the}} refraction itself by {{filling in the}} gouges in the substrate with a fluid such as perchloroethene that shares approximately the same refractive index as the substrate. With the fluid temporarily displacing {{the air in the}} scratches and abrasions, refraction simply no longer occurs, so the defects are not reflected on the new copy. The light used is fully collimated, as with standard optical printing, and the film is undamaged by the process. This method does not work if the scratches on the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> are deep enough to have removed some of the silver or dye image in the original film.|$|E
50|$|Film is also {{classified}} {{according to}} its gauge and the arrangement of its perforations— gauges range from 8 mm to 70 mm or more, while perforations may vary in shape, pitch, and positioning. The film is also distinguished by how it is wound with regard to perforations and base or <b>emulsion</b> <b>side,</b> as well as whether it is packaged around a core, a daylight spool, or within a cartridge. Depending on the manufacturing processes and camera equipment, lengths can vary anywhere from 25 to 2000 feet. Common lengths include 25 feet for 8 mm, 50 feet for Super 8, 100 and 400 feet for 16 mm, 400 and 1000 feet for 35 mm, and 1000 for 65/70 mm.|$|E
5000|$|A notch code {{is a set}} of notches or {{recesses}} {{cut into}} the edge of a piece of sheet film to provide a tactile way to identify the film brand, type, and processing chemistry (e.g. black and white, color negative, or color reversal) in the dark. It enables photographers to identify the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> of the film when loading sheet film holders, and helps processing lab technicians avoid placing sheets in the wrong processor. After processing the notches serve as a permanent visual record of the same information. When the film is oriented vertically (portrait format), the notches are in the top edge near the upper right corner when the emulsion faces the viewer.|$|E
50|$|At {{least two}} PTRs {{are needed in}} the film path - one for the base side {{and one for the}} <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> - though four are {{frequently}} used. A set of PTRs is frequently placed in the film paths of projectors, telecine machines, scanners and printers in order to remove dust and contaminants {{from the surface of the}} film before projection, transfer or duplication. PTRs are also used in some dedicated film cleaning machines, or mounted between rewind heads and used for manual cleaning. The contaminants are lifted from the film and adhere to the roller as the film passes in contact with it. The rollers themselves are then cleaned, usually in soapy water, and dried before the next use.|$|E
50|$|The {{first step}} in the process was the removal of the antihalation backing with an {{alkaline}} solution and wash. The film was then developed using a developer containing phenidone and hydroquinone, which formed three superimposed negative images, one for each primary color. After the first developer was washed out, the film underwent re-exposure and redevelopment. Re-exposure fogged the silver halides that were not developed in the first developer. A color developer then developed the fogged image, and its exhaustion products reacted with a color coupler to form a dye in the color complementary to the layer's sensitivity. The red-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the base of the film with red light, then redeveloped forming cyan dye. The blue-sensitive layer was re-exposed through the <b>emulsion</b> <b>side</b> of the film with blue light, then redeveloped forming yellow dye. The green-sensitive layer was redeveloped with a developer that chemically fogged it and formed magenta dye. After color development, the metallic silver was converted to silver halide using a bleach solution. The film was then fixed, making these silver halides soluble and leaving only the final dye image. The final steps were to wash the film to remove residual chemicals which might cause deterioration of the dye image, then to dry, cut, and mount the film in slide frames.|$|E
