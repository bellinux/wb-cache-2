Under his stewardship his often financially troubled abbey remained solvent (a difficult task given the small endowment {{and the vast}} cost of providing hospitality to travellers by land and sea and the king’s sailors) {{and he was able}} to build up a <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> worth more than £100, a huge sum for the time and not far off the annual net income of the abbey, and to pay down the debts. He also maintained high standards of religious life at the abbey, and he and his seven monks gained good reports to the king from the local gentry and were much respected in the neighbourhood. Thomas was trusted by the government too, as is shown by his being given custody of two Franciscan friars, who presumably had offended the king by opposing his religious policies.|$|E

Wellingborough's Local Plan states that [...] "planning permission will be granted for a heritage park {{in association with the}} archaeological remains of the Chester camp ancient monument" [...] as part of the planned River Nene Regional Park.

The sponsor has been identified, but unlike most {{television}} programs, the performer hasn't been provided with a script. As a matter of fact, I have been permitted to choose my own words and discuss my own ideas regarding the choice that we face {{in the next few}} weeks.I have spent most of my life as a Democrat. I recently have seen fit to follow another course. I believe that the issues confronting us cross party lines. Now, one side in this campaign has been telling us that the issues of this election are the maintenance of peace and prosperity. The line has been used, [...] "We've never had it so good."But I have an uncomfortable feeling that this prosperity isn't something on which we can base our hopes for the future. No nation in history has ever survived a tax burden that reached a third of its national income. Today, 37 cents out of every dollar earned in this country is the tax collector's share, and yet our government continues to spend 17 million dollars a day more than the government takes in. We haven't balanced our budget 28 out of the last 34 years. We've raised our debt limit three times in the last twelve months, and now our national debt is one and a half times bigger than all the combined debts of all the nations of the world. We have 15 billion dollars in gold in our treasury; we don't own an ounce. Foreign dollar claims are 27.3 billion dollars. And we've just had announced that the dollar of 1939 will now purchase 45 cents in its total value.As for the peace that we would preserve, I wonder who among us would like to approach the wife or mother whose husband or son has died in South Vietnam and ask them if they think this is a peace that should be maintained indefinitely. Do they mean peace, or do they mean we just want to be left in peace? There can be no real peace while one American is dying some place in the world for the rest of us. We're at war with the most dangerous enemy that has ever faced mankind in his long climb from the swamp to the stars, and it's been said if we lose that war, and in so doing lose this way of freedom of ours, history will record with the greatest astonishment that those who had the most to lose did the least to prevent its happening. Well I think it's time we ask ourselves if we still know the freedoms that were intended for us by the Founding Fathers.Not too long ago, two friends of mine were talking to a Cuban refugee, a businessman who had escaped from Castro, {{and in the midst of}} his story one of my friends turned to the other and said, [...] "We don't know how lucky we are." [...] And the Cuban stopped and said, [...] "How lucky you are? I had someplace to escape to." [...] And in that sentence he told us the entire story. If we lose freedom here, there's no place to escape to. This is the last stand on earth.And this idea that government is beholden to the people, that it has no other source of power except the sovereign people, is still the newest and the most unique idea in all the long history of man's relation to man.This is the issue of this election: whether we believe in our capacity for self-government or whether we abandon the American revolution and confess that a little intellectual elite in a far-distant capitol can plan our lives for us better than we can plan them ourselves.You and I are told increasingly we have to choose between a left or right. Well I'd like to suggest there is no such thing as a left or right. There's only an up or down: up man's old -- old-aged dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order, or down to the ant heap of totalitarianism. And regardless of their sincerity, their humanitarian motives, those who would trade our freedom for security have embarked on this downward course.In this vote-harvesting time, they use terms like the [...] "Great Society," [...] or as we were told a few days ago by the President, we must accept a greater government activity in the affairs of the people. But they've been a little more explicit in the past and among themselves; and all of the things I now will quote have appeared in print. These are not Republican accusations. For example, they have voices that say, [...] "The cold war will end through our acceptance of a not undemocratic socialism." [...] Another voice says, [...] "The profit motive has become outmoded. It must be replaced by the incentives of the welfare state." [...] Or, [...] "Our traditional system of individual freedom is incapable of solving the complex problems of the 20th century." [...] Senator Fulbright has said at Stanford University that the Constitution is outmoded. He referred to the President as [...] "our moral teacher and our leader," [...] and he says he is [...] "hobbled in his task by the restrictions of power imposed on him by this antiquated document." [...] He must [...] "be freed," [...] so that he [...] "can do for us" [...] what he knows [...] "is best." [...] And Senator Clark of Pennsylvania, another articulate spokesman, defines liberalism as [...] "meeting the material needs of the masses through the full power of centralized government."Well, I, for one, resent it when a representative of the people refers to you and me, the free men and women of this country, as [...] "the masses." [...] This is a term we haven't applied to ourselves in America. But beyond that, [...] "the full power of centralized government" [...] -- this was the very thing the Founding Fathers sought to minimize. They knew that governments don't control things. A government can't control the economy without controlling people. And they know when a government sets out to do that, it must use force and coercion to achieve its purpose. They also knew, those Founding Fathers, that outside of its legitimate functions, government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector of the economy.Now, we have no better example of this than government's involvement in the farm economy over the last 30 years. Since 1955, the cost of this program has nearly doubled. One-fourth of farming in America is responsible for 85% of the <b>farm</b> <b>surplus.</b> Three-fourths of farming is out on the free market and has known a 21% increase in the per capita consumption of all its produce. You see, that one-fourth of farming -- that's regulated and controlled by the federal government. In the last three years we've spent 43 dollars in the feed grain program for every dollar bushel of corn we don't grow.Senator Humphrey last week charged that Barry Goldwater, as President, would seek to eliminate farmers. He should do his homework a little better, because he'll find out that we've had a decline of 5 million in the farm population under these government programs. He'll also find that the Democratic administration has sought to get from Congress an extension of the farm program to include that three-fourths that is now free. He'll find that they've also asked for the right to imprison farmers who wouldn't keep books as prescribed by the federal government. The Secretary of Agriculture asked for the right to seize farms through condemnation and resell them to other individuals. And contained in that same program was a provision that would have allowed the federal government to remove 2 million farmers from the soil.At the same time, there's been an increase in the Department of Agriculture employees. There's now one for every 30 farms in the United States, and still they can't tell us how 66 shiploads of grain headed for Austria disappeared without a trace and Billie Sol Estes never left shore.Every responsible farmer and farm organization has repeatedly asked the government to free the farm economy, but how -- who are farmers to know what's best for them? The wheat farmers voted against a wheat program. The government passed it anyway. Now the price of bread goes up; the price of wheat to the farmer goes down.Meanwhile, back in the city, under urban renewal the assault on freedom carries on. Private property rights are so diluted that public interest is almost anything a few government planners decide it should be. In a program that takes from the needy and gives to the greedy, we see such spectacles as in Cleveland, Ohio, a million-and-a-half-dollar building completed only three years ago must be destroyed to make way for what government officials call a [...] "more compatible use of the land." [...] The President tells us he's now going to start building public housing units in the thousands, where heretofore we've only built them in the hundreds. But FHA Housing Authority and the Veterans Administration tell us they have 120,000 housing units they've taken back through mortgage foreclosure. For three decades, we've sought to solve the problems of unemployment through government planning, and the more the plans fail, the more the planners plan. The latest is the Area Redevelopment Agency.They've just declared Rice County, Kansas, a depressed area. Rice County, Kansas, has two hundred oil wells, and the 14,000 people there have over 30 million dollars on deposit in personal savings in their banks. And when the government tells you you're depressed, lie down and be depressed.We have so many people who can't see a fat man standing beside a thin one without coming to the conclusion the fat man got that way by taking advantage of the thin one. So they're going to solve all the problems of human misery through government and government planning. Well, now, if government planning and welfare had the answer -- and they've had almost 30 years of it -- shouldn't we expect government to read the score to us once in a while? Shouldn't they be telling us about the decline each year in the number of people needing help? The reduction in the need for public housing?But the reverse is true. Each year the need grows greater; the program grows greater. We were told four years ago that 17 million people went to bed hungry each night. Well that was probably true. They were all on a diet. But now we're told that 9.3 million families in this country are poverty-stricken on the basis of earning less than 3,000 dollars a year. Welfare spending is 10 times greater than in the dark depths of the Depression. We're spending 45 billion dollars on welfare. Now do a little arithmetic, and you'll find that if we divided the 45 billion dollars up equally among those 9 million poor families, we'd be able to give each family 4,600 dollars a year. And this added to their present income should eliminate poverty. Direct aid to the poor, however, is only running only about 600 dollars per family. It would seem that someplace there must be some overhead.Now -- so now we declare [...] "war on poverty," [...] or [...] "You, too, can be a Bobby Baker." [...] Now do they honestly expect us to believe that if we add 1 billion dollars to the 45 billion we're spending, one more program to the 30-odd we have -- and remember, this new program doesn't replace any, it just duplicates existing programs -- do they believe that poverty is suddenly going to disappear by magic? Well, in all fairness I should explain there is one part of the new program that isn't duplicated. This is the youth feature. We're now going to solve the dropout problem, juvenile delinquency, by reinstituting something like the old CCC camps Conservation Corps, and we're going to put our young people in these camps. But again we do some arithmetic, and we find that we're going to spend each year just on room and board for each young person we help 4,700 dollars a year. We can send them to Harvard for 2,700! Course, don't get me wrong. I'm not suggesting Harvard is the answer to juvenile delinquency.But seriously, what are we doing to those we seek to help? Not too long ago, a judge called me here in Los Angeles. He told me of a young woman who'd come before him for a divorce. She had six children, was pregnant with her seventh. Under his questioning, she revealed her husband was a laborer earning 250 dollars a month. She wanted a divorce to get an 80 dollar raise. She's eligible for 330 dollars a month in the Aid to Dependent Children Program. She got the idea from two women in her neighborhood who'd already done that very thing.Yet anytime you and I question the schemes of the do-gooders, we're denounced as being against their humanitarian goals. They say we're always [...] "against" [...] things -- we're never [...] "for" [...] anything.Well, the trouble with our liberal friends is not that they're ignorant; it's just that they know so much that isn't so.Now -- we're for a provision that destitution should not follow unemployment by reason of old age, and to that end we've accepted Social Security as a step toward meeting the problem.But we're against those entrusted with this program when they practice deception regarding its fiscal shortcomings, when they charge that any criticism of the program means that we want to end payments to those people who depend on them for a livelihood. They've called it [...] "insurance" [...] to us in a hundred million pieces of literature. But then they appeared before the Supreme Court and they testified it was a welfare program. They only use the term [...] "insurance" [...] to sell it to the people. And they said Social Security dues are a tax for the general use of the government, and the government has used that tax. There is no fund, because Robert Byers, the actuarial head, appeared before a congressional committee and admitted that Social Security as of this moment is 298 billion dollars in the hole. But he said there should be no cause for worry because as long as they have the power to tax, they could always take away from the people whatever they needed to bail them out of trouble. And they're doing just that.A young man, 21 years of age, working at an average salary -- his Social Security contribution would, in the open market, buy him an insurance policy that would guarantee 220 dollars a month at age 65. The government promises 127. He could live it up until he's 31 and then take out a policy that would pay more than Social Security. Now are we so lacking in business sense that we can't put this program on a sound basis, so that people who do require those payments will find they can get them when they're due -- that the cupboard isn't bare?Barry Goldwater thinks we can.At the same time, can't we introduce voluntary features that would permit a citizen who can do better on his own to be excused upon presentation of evidence that he had made provision for the non-earning years? Should we not allow a widow with children to work, and not lose the benefits supposedly paid for by her deceased husband? Shouldn't you and I be allowed to declare who our beneficiaries will be under this program, which we cannot do? I think we're for telling our senior citizens that no one in this country should be denied medical care because of a lack of funds. But I think we're against forcing all citizens, regardless of need, into a compulsory government program, especially when we have such examples, as was announced last week, when France admitted that their Medicare program is now bankrupt. They've come to the end of the road.In addition, was Barry Goldwater so irresponsible when he suggested that our government give up its program of deliberate, planned inflation, so that when you do get your Social Security pension, a dollar will buy a dollar's worth, and not 45 cents worth?I think we're for an international organization, where the nations of the world can seek peace. But I think we're against subordinating American interests to an organization that has become so structurally unsound that today you can muster a two-thirds vote on the floor of the General Assembly among nations that represent less than 10 percent of the world's population. I think we're against the hypocrisy of assailing our allies because here and there they cling to a colony, while we engage in a conspiracy of silence and never open our mouths about the millions of people enslaved in the Soviet colonies in the satellite nations.I think we're for aiding our allies by sharing of our material blessings with those nations which share in our fundamental beliefs, but we're against doling out money government to government, creating bureaucracy, if not socialism, all over the world. We set out to help 19 countries. We're helping 107. We've spent 146 billion dollars. With that money, we bought a 2 million dollar yacht for Haile Selassie. We bought dress suits for Greek undertakers, extra wives for Kenyan government officials. We bought a thousand TV sets for a place where they have no electricity. In the last six years, 52 nations have bought 7 billion dollars worth of our gold, and all 52 are receiving foreign aid from this country.No government ever voluntarily reduces itself in size. So, governments' programs, once launched, never disappear.Actually, a government bureau is the nearest thing to eternal life we'll ever see on this earth.Federal employees -- federal employees number two and a half million; and federal, state, and local, one out of six of the nation's work force employed by government. These proliferating bureaus with their thousands of regulations have cost us many of our constitutional safeguards. How many of us realize that today federal agents can invade a man's property without a warrant? They can impose a fine without a formal hearing, let alone a trial by jury? And they can seize and sell his property at auction to enforce the payment of that fine. In Chico County, Arkansas, James Wier over-planted his rice allotment. The government obtained a 17,000 dollar judgment. And a U.S. marshal sold his 960-acre farm at auction. The government said it was necessary as a warning to others to make the system work.Last February 19th at the University of Minnesota, Norman Thomas, six-times candidate for President on the Socialist Party ticket, said, [...] "If Barry Goldwater became President, he would stop the advance of socialism in the United States." [...] I think that's exactly what he will do.But as a former Democrat, I can tell you Norman Thomas isn't the only man who has drawn this parallel to socialism with the present administration, because back in 1936, Mr. Democrat himself, Al Smith, the great American, came before the American people and charged that the leadership of his Party was taking the Party of Jefferson, Jackson, and Cleveland down the road under the banners of Marx, Lenin, and Stalin. And he walked away from his Party, and he never returned til the day he died -- because to this day, the leadership of that Party has been taking that Party, that honorable Party, down the road in the image of the labor Socialist Party of England.Now it doesn't require expropriation or confiscation of private property or business to impose socialism on a people. What does it mean whether you hold the deed to the -- or the title to your business or property if the government holds the power of life and death over that business or property? And such machinery already exists. The government can find some charge to bring against any concern it chooses to prosecute. Every businessman has his own tale of harassment. Somewhere a perversion has taken place. Our natural, unalienable rights are now considered to be a dispensation of government, and freedom has never been so fragile, so close to slipping from our grasp as it is at this moment.Our Democratic opponents seem unwilling to debate these issues. They want to make you and I believe that this is a contest between two men -- that we're to choose just between two personalities.Well what of this man that they would destroy -- and in destroying, they would destroy that which he represents, the ideas that you and I hold dear? Is he the brash and shallow and trigger-happy man they say he is? Well I've been privileged to know him [...] "when." [...] I knew him long before he ever dreamed of trying for high office, and I can tell you personally I've never known a man in my life I believed so incapable of doing a dishonest or dishonorable thing.This is a man who, in his own business before he entered politics, instituted a profit-sharing plan before unions had ever thought of it. He put in health and medical insurance for all his employees. He took 50 percent of the profits before taxes and set up a retirement program, a pension plan for all his employees. He sent monthly checks for life to an employee who was ill and couldn't work. He provides nursing care for the children of mothers who work in the stores. When Mexico was ravaged by the floods in the Rio Grande, he climbed in his airplane and flew medicine and supplies down there.An ex-GI told me how he met him. It was the week before Christmas during the Korean War, and he was at the Los Angeles airport trying to get a ride home to Arizona for Christmas. And he said that were a lot of servicemen there and no seats available on the planes. And then a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, [...] "Any men in uniform wanting a ride to Arizona, go to runway such-and-such," [...] and they went down there, and there was a fellow named Barry Goldwater sitting in his plane. Every day in those weeks before Christmas, all day long, he'd load up the plane, fly it to Arizona, fly them to their homes, fly back over to get another load.During the hectic split-second timing of a campaign, this is a man who took time out to sit beside an old friend who was dying of cancer. His campaign managers were understandably impatient, but he said, [...] "There aren't many left who care what happens to her. I'd like her to know I care." [...] This is a man who said to his 19-year-old son, [...] "There is no foundation like the rock of honesty and fairness, and when you begin to build your life on that rock, with the cement of the faith in God that you have, then you have a real start." [...] This is not a man who could carelessly send other people's sons to war. And that is the issue of this campaign that makes all the other problems I've discussed academic, unless we realize we're in a war that must be won.Those who would trade our freedom for the soup kitchen of the welfare state have told us they have a utopian solution of peace without victory. They call their policy [...] "accommodation." [...] And they say if we'll only avoid any direct confrontation with the enemy, he'll forget his evil ways and learn to love us. All who oppose them are indicted as warmongers. They say we offer simple answers to complex problems. Well, perhaps there is a simple answer -- not an easy answer -- but simple: If you and I have the courage to tell our elected officials that we want our national policy based on what we know in our hearts is morally right.We cannot buy our security, our freedom from the threat of the bomb by committing an immorality so great as saying to a billion human beings now enslaved behind the Iron Curtain, [...] "Give up your dreams of freedom because to save our own skins, we're willing to make a deal with your slave masters." [...] Alexander Hamilton said, [...] "A nation which can prefer disgrace to danger is prepared for a master, and deserves one." [...] Now let's set the record straight. There's no argument over the choice between peace and war, but there's only one guaranteed way you can have peace -- and you can have it in the next second -- surrender.Admittedly, there's a risk in any course we follow other than this, but every lesson of history tells us that the greater risk lies in appeasement, and this is the specter our well-meaning liberal friends refuse to face -- that their policy of accommodation is appeasement, and it gives no choice between peace and war, only between fight or surrender. If we continue to accommodate, continue to back and retreat, eventually we have to face the final demand -- the ultimatum. And what then -- when Nikita Khrushchev has told his people he knows what our answer will be? He has told them that we're retreating under the pressure of the Cold War, and someday when the time comes to deliver the final ultimatum, our surrender will be voluntary, because by that time we will have been weakened from within spiritually, morally, and economically. He believes this because from our side he's heard voices pleading for [...] "peace at any price" [...] or [...] "better Red than dead," [...] or as one commentator put it, he'd rather [...] "live on his knees than die on his feet." [...] And therein lies the road to war, because those voices don't speak for the rest of us.You and I know and do not believe that life is so dear and peace so sweet as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery. If nothing in life is worth dying for, when did this begin -- just in the face of this enemy? Or should Moses have told the children of Israel to live in slavery under the pharaohs? Should Christ have refused the cross? Should the patriots at Concord Bridge have thrown down their guns and refused to fire the shot heard 'round the world? The martyrs of history were not fools, and our honored dead who gave their lives to stop the advance of the Nazis didn't die in vain. Where, then, is the road to peace? Well it's a simple answer after all.You and I have the courage to say to our enemies, [...] "There is a price we will not pay." [...] "There is a point beyond which they must not advance." [...] And this -- this is the meaning in the phrase of Barry Goldwater's [...] "peace through strength." [...] Winston Churchill said, [...] "The destiny of man is not measured by material computations. When great forces are on the move in the world, we learn we're spirits -- not animals." [...] And he said, [...] "There's something going on in time and space, and beyond time and space, which, whether we like it or not, spells duty."You and I have a rendezvous with destiny.We'll preserve for our children this, the last best hope of man on earth, or we'll sentence them to take the last step into a thousand years of darkness.We will keep in mind and remember that Barry Goldwater has faith in us. He has faith that you and I have the ability and the dignity and the right to make our own decisions and determine our own destiny.Thank you very much." ...|$|E

40|$|The New Zealand dairy {{industry}} has grown significantly {{over the past}} decade through increasing both area farmed and the number of cows milked. Dairy farm systems have intensified {{as a result of the}} use of supplementary feeding, increased stocking rate and land use changes. Environmental regulations have been implemented as a means to limit and mitigate the negative environmental impacts of dairy under the National Policy Statement for Fresh Water. In the Waikato, regulation to date has predominatly been focused on effluent storage and application. As such, regulation has not yet shaped how Waikato farm systems are implemented. It is likely that future regulation for the Waikato will include nitrogen loss limits. Management of nutrient cycles will therefore become a high priority for effective farm management as well as being used to inform the adoption of changes to farming systems. Four nitrogen (N) loss mitigation strategies were modelled for Waikato dairy farm systems of low, medium and high input to show the changes in N leaching and economic <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> per hectare. Reductions in N leaching for farm environmental compliance were able to be achieved through farm management practices as well as through additional farm infrastructure. Large reductions of 20 percent and 17 percent were achieved through destocking and cow housing scenarios respectively. A corresponding lift in <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> per hectare of 1 percent and 11 percent was recorded. Similarly, moderate reductions in N leaching were achieved through winter grazing off farm (9 percent) and increased effluent management facilities (8 percent). However a 4 percent reduction in <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> was noted for the winter grazing scenario while increasing the effluent area had no material impact on farm working expenses or revenue. This research identified cow housing as farm infrastructure which for low, medium and high input farm systems was able to return a reduction in N leaching greater than 15 percent and increase <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> by greater than 9 percent. The implementation of cow housing was modelled for a large scale farm system in the Taharua catchment where N limits are currently being enforced. Results of the modelling show a cow housing facility for large scale dairy farming has a positive internal rate of return of 13 percent. Waikato dairy farmers were surveyed to gather data on the initial capital cost of compliance and the farm system implications of increased regulation to date. The survey illustrated that effluent compliance has been the focus of investment and highlights the significant cost to the {{dairy industry}} of internalising environmental impacts. Aggregated survey results indicate that the capital cost of environmental spending to date for the average Waikato farm system has totaled $ 1. 02 per kgMS, $ 1487 per hectare or $ 404 per cow. This equates to an average investment of $ 110, 000 per farm. A clear understanding of the impact of environmental regulation and the relative cost of compliance for different farm systems is needed to produce accurate measures of environmental performance and to improve the cost efficiency of dairy production systems. Importantly there is a need to understand how different farming systems can work together at a catchment, regional and national level to achieve both value creation and environmental sustainability as set out in the national policy frameworks...|$|E
40|$|In the Starborough-Flaxbourne {{area the}} local farming community, alarmed at the {{increasing}} hill slope erosion, {{set up a}} soil conservation group. Accelerated erosion was {{a symptom of the}} past 12 years of below average rainfall. Removal of vegetative cover by livestock had enabled wind to erode areas of the thin topsoil exposing vulnerable sodic subsoil to rill and tunnel erosion. This highlighted the need for farms to adapt their livestock systems to a drier environment if they were to survive. An adaptation process had been undertaken on Bonavaree by the land owners, the Avery family. In redesigning their farm system they moved away from ryegrass pastures and brassica crops to a lucerne grazing system. This system prioritised the performance of multiple bearing ewes, high pre-weaning lamb liveweight gains (390 g/day) and a rigorous decision making process that avoided relying on the most risky periods of forage growth. The result has been 5 years of an improving economic <b>farm</b> <b>surplus,</b> lower grazing pressure on hill slopes and improving vegetative cover...|$|E

The model allows pasture to be used by grazing animals in 12 periods throughout the year, subject to maximum and minimum constraints on pasture cover which have the effect of limiting the amount of feed that can be transferred from one period to the next. Supplementary feed activities within the model include hay and nitrogen. The animal production activities considered by the model were: (1) a breeding sheep system producing meat and wool; (2) a beef cattle system comprising breeding and finishing stock; and (3) a bull beef system. The model was used to optimise <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> ($/farm). The results demonstrated that farm profitability could be substancially increased in direct proportion to the rate at which bull beef substitutes for, firstly sheep, and secondly breeding and finishing cattle. However, to attain higher profits, current management constraints, in particular the maximum number of Friesian bulls and/or the minimum number of breeding ewes on the property will have to be overcome. Investigation of these issues as well as the effect of climatic variability on the various plans derived are clearly identified as areas requiring further study and consideration...|$|E
40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the management and}} profitability of three lambings in two years under Southland conditions, and how they compare with those of a conventional Southland farming system. There has been little work done world wide but what overseas literature there is suggests that lambing ewes three times in two years (ie. a sustained 8 monthly lambing interval) is possible. It does however require the seasonal breeding nature of the ewe to be altered either by cross-breeding, selection, use of the 'ram effect', exogenous hormones {{or a combination of}} the above. There has been no work done in New Zealand on three lambings in two years, so overseas information and New Zealand data on autumn lambing has been used in this study. To analyse the conventional and three lambings in two years farming systems, a feed profile model has been used to determine stock numbers carried and lamb production under each of the conception and feeding regimes studied. Feasibility of each system is dependant on average pasture cover remaining above the minimum required pasture cover (to achieve desire intakes) at all times. Results from feed profiling showed that the winter and early spring is the critical feeding period, thus determining the stocking rate. The conventional system wintered 19. 4 SU/ha under all grass and hay wintering. However the use of a high yielding winter feed crop was necessary to maintain a stocking rate of 13. 6 SU/ha through winter for a multiple lambing system. For the prices received in the 1988 / 89 year, the financial result {{is that there is a}} lower return for three lambings in two years than for a high producing conventional Southland farm ($ 76 000 vs $ 92 000 cash <b>farm</b> <b>surplus).</b> Thus there are no financial benefits to the farmer to compensate for the additional risk, and labour and management requirements associated with such a system. Even with price conditions which favour the multiple lambing system (ie lower wool prices and higher prices for lambs sold in winter) the return is only slightly above that of the traditional farms - A return that is too low to warrant lambing ewes three times in two years in Southland...|$|E
40|$|The {{environmental}} impact of 12 dairy farms in Denmark, Germany and Italy was evaluated using an LCA approach {{and the most important}} parameters influencing their environmental sustainability were identified. The farms represent different production methods (organic vs. conventional), summer feeding systems (confinement vs. pasture) and annual production levels (6275 – 10, 964 kg ECM cow− 1). There was large variability in stocking rates (1. 1 – 11. 0 LU ha− 1) among farms, which has a major impact on the production per unit area of farmland, on feed self-sufficiency and on <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> of nitrogen. The proportion of grassland on farmland used for forage production or pasture varied from 0 to 100 %. The lowest global warming potential (GWP), acidification, eutrophication and non-renewable energy use were achieved by the German pasture-based system, followed by the Danish organic dairy system and the very intensive Italian farming system with very similar {{environmental impact}} values. However, a sensitivity analysis showed that when emissions relating to direct land use change of soybean production were included in the assessment, the GWP changed considerably for the conventional farms due to the inclusion of conventional soymeal in the feed concentrate. There were strong and positive correlations between the four impact categories, and overall the results indicate that improving greenhouse gas emissions would improve the general environmental sustainability of the dairy farm. The land occupation was lowest in the farms with the highest stocking rate. The organic Danish farms had the lowest impact on biodiversity loss, which in general was positively influenced by the share of grassland in the system. A high proportion of grassland also had a significant positive effect on GWP, acidification and energy use. The other feature that mainly improved the environmental impact was the feed efficiency of the dairy cows, which was negatively correlated with GWP, acidification and eutrophication. We found no relation between the environmental impact and the milk production per cow or the stocking rate at the farm. However, due to the limited number of observations (only 12 farms were assessed), the results of the correlation analyses should be handled with care. There was also large variation in the relative contributions from on- and off-farm activities among farms and for the different impact categories, showing the importance of a holistic approach and the difficulties in evaluating a farming system both in a product and area-based perspectiv...|$|E

40|$|Public Law 480, the Trade Development and Assistance Act, {{was passed}} by the 83 rd. Congress in July, 1954, for the purpose of {{utilizing}} surplus agricultural commodities to further the foreign policy of the United States. The Act provides that surplus agricultural commodities shall be sold for foreign currencies, with the proceeds of the sales used for trade development, economic development, the payment of U. S. obligations abroad, and other uses which promote U. S. foriegn policy. The majority of P. L. 480 exports are shipped under Title I, sales for foreign currencies. The rationale behind the use of surplus agricultural commodities to promote economic development in receiving countries is the following: The U. S. sells agricultural commodities to underdeveloped countries. It then grants or loans the majority of the local currency proceeds back to the country involved to be used in its development program. The additional investments undertaken {{as a result of the}} grants and loans create new income, part of which are spent on the agricultural products supplied by P. L. 480. Thus, P. L. 480 provides additional resources for the receiving countries, and enables them to undertake a greater amount of investment than would be possible in the absence of the food aid. Food aid through P. L. 480 can increase the rate of economic development in the receiving country by increasing the rate of capital formation and by increasing the efficiency of the use of capital. It increases the rate of capital formation by freeing foreign exchange, redistributing income, and by reducing inflationary inflationary pressures which tend to curtail capital formation. It increases the efficiency of the use of capital by furthering education and technical training. There are several problems which seem likely to accompany the use of food aid to promote economic development. The two most serious problems are first, that surplus food imports tend to decrease agricultural prices in the receiving country, and second, that the local currencies generated by P. L. 480 Title I transactions tend to be inflationary in the receiving country. The inflation problem is compounded by the lags which frequently occur between the shipment of the agricultural commodities and the transfer of the local currencies back to the receiving country. It is very likely that P. L. 480 will continue in the next decade, due to the continued existence of the U. S. <b>farm</b> <b>surplus.</b> Because of its apparent success in promoting economic development, and because of its negligible effect on the U.

40|$|Many {{changes have}} taken place in New Zealand during the last 20 years. These changes have {{affected}} the dairy sector in its broadest sense, at both industry and farm level. After economic deregulation (1984), a survey was conducted in 1992 amongst a sample of pastoral New Zealand farmers to assess the perception of risk and the strategies most commonly used by them to manage risk. Dairy farmers were part of the total sample analysed. Since the 1980 s agriculture, not only in New Zealand but world wide, has changed at a rapid rate with farmers facing a challenging environment. The identification of both sources of variation and management strategies for them has made risk management a high priority issue. Therefore {{there is a need to}} understand the critical aspects of the environment faced by New Zealand dairy farmers, to update our knowledge of how they are recognizing and managing risk. The main objective of this research was to assess farmers' risk perception and identify the main variables affecting risk in New Zealand dairy systems. To accomplish the objectives, the 1992 survey was replicated with another sample of dairy farmers. Additionally a logistic regression was used to analyse the ProfitWatch Database (Dexcel). The four most important sources of risk perceived by farmers in 2004 were from the market side of their operations (2), Human (1) and Financial (1). To control risk, farmers were mainly focused in the use of Production and Financial strategies. The risks perceived and the use of risk management strategies have changed significantly during the last twelve years. Now farmers perceive more risk in almost all the sources identified in the surveys and they also make more intensive use of almost all the strategies to cope with those sources of risk. Significant differences were also found in the perception of some of the risk sources of the different groups of farmers analysed (Sharemilkers vs. Owner-operators and; North Island vs. South Island dairy farmers). Finally the database analysis showed that of the seven variables included in the logistic regression to assess risk, measured as Return on Equity (ROE), only four of them were found to be significant for the model. In order of importance, these were: the Debt Servicing Capacity (DSC), the Debt to Asset Ratio (DTAR), the Asset Turnover Ratio (ATR) and the Operating Profit Margin (OPM). The findings of this research have confirmed that currently farmers are mainly concerned about the changes of prices, changes in world situation, accidents or health problems and changes in interest rates; however to control risk they are both production- and financial-orientated. With this clear profile, it can be stated that indeed risk perception and the way farmers manage risk has changed during the last twelve years. Additionally, farmers perceive sources of risks and manage them differently, according to their specific situation (e. g. Ownership structure, Geographic location). The analysis of the database showed that increases in farm size were not associated with a decrease in risk (ROE). Also, the use of Farm Working Expense Ratio and Economic <b>Farm</b> <b>Surplus</b> as the main variables to evaluate cost control and profitability of dairy farms overlook more useful ratios of ATR and OPM. Finally, high levels of debt can lead to reduction in the risk faced by a dairy business if non-equity capital (money borrowed) is efficiently used and high levels of efficiencies, both capital and operational, are achieved...|$|E
40|$|Dairy {{production}} in Argentina {{is based on}} grazed pastures, with the inclusion of supplements as a secondary source of feed. The average milk production per hectare in Argentine dairy farms is low and this affects the profitability of the farms. The low efficiency of production per hectare appears {{to be associated with}} low stocking rate and low utilisation of the cheapest source of feed, which is grazed pasture. Data reviewed in the present study suggested that stocking rate (SR) and the amount of imported feed are factors with significant influence on dairy farm productivity and profitability in Argentina, as is also the case in New Zealand and Australia. Stocking rate, expressed as the number of cows per hectare, is a simplification of the relationship between feed demand and feed supply. This relationship can be better expressed as kilograms of live weight per tonne of dry matter total feed supply, defined as comparative stocking rate. The aim of this thesis was to quantify the effects of comparative SR and supplementation (imported feed) on the productivity and profitability of Argentine dairy farms. A simulation model was developed to predict pasture dry matter (DM) intake and the harvesting efficiency of grazing dairy cows in Argentina (Chapter 3). In validation tests, using data from cows grazing lucerne in Argentina and ryegrass-clover in Ireland, the model predicted satisfactorily. Following this, a simulation model was developed to predict milksolids (MS) production and live weight (Lwt) change of Argentine Holstein cows in grazing dairy systems, given a determined intake of metabolisable energy (Chapter 4). Finally, a whole-farm simulation model called the Argentine Dairy System Model (ADSM) was developed (Chapter 5). by integrating the models developed in Chapter 3 and 4, together with a pre-existent economic model for Argentine dairy farms. Model validation was conducted by comparing results from the model against data form eight Argentine dairy farms. The accuracy of model predictions was satisfactory. Twenty-two dairy systems were tested with ADSM, in order to allow the effects of comparative SR and supplementation to be explored. The cow type used was the Argentine Holstein (550 kg Lwt and 6. 8 % MS content). The present study suggests that the low MS production of Argentine dairy farms could be increased by increasing both comparative SR and the amount of supplements imported into the farm. Model predictions indicated that MS production per hectare would be maximised at a comparative SR of approximately 100 kg Lwt/t DM, economic <b>farm</b> <b>surplus</b> ($US/ha) at 90 kg Lwt/t DM, and return on assets at 80 kg Lwt/t DM. Additionally, the model predicted that cows stocked at a comparative SR of about 80 kg Lwt/t DM will neither increase nor decrease Lwt change over a complete season (lactating and dry periods). These results suggest that the optimum comparative SR, in terms of both economic and sustainable physical performance for the Argentine Holstein cows seems to be around 80 kg Lwt/t DM. Annual pasture utilization values were 70 %, 76 %, and 81 % for comparative SRs of 80, 90, and 100 kg Lwt /t DM, respectively. At the milk payout and concentrates price used in this study, it would be profitable {{to increase the amount of}} imported feed up to 3. 6 t DM per hectare, provided that SR is simultaneously increased, in order to achieve pasture utilisation of 70 % or higher. A dairy system with 8. 6 t DM/ha/year produced on-farm, importing 3. 6 t DM concentrates per year and stocked at 81 kg Lwt/t DM (1. 8 cows/ha) would be able to utilise 71 % of pasture and produce 626 kg MS/ha/year, which is about two-fold the average MS production of Argentine farms. Changing either the price of milk or the cost of concentrates by 10 % did not alter the relative profitability of the different systems...|$|E

Johnston and Kilby (1975) and Mellor (1976) first documented the structural transformation process in the regions of Asia where the Green Revolution later bloomed. The structural transformation process starts with broad-based agricultural growth, causing a build-up of purchasing power by millions of small farmers.
