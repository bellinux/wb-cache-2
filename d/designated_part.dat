5|$|What is now MD 5 between Leonardtown Road and Poplar Hill Road was {{constructed}} as {{a gravel road}} by 1927. This road was <b>designated</b> <b>part</b> of MD 233. In 1956, MD 382 was extended west into Charles County along part {{of what had been}} MD 233 to MD 5 at Beantown. MD 382 was removed from Charles County in 1989. That same year, MD 205 was assigned to the westernmost portion of Poplar Hill Road in Beantown and north along two-lane MattawomanBeantown Road to US 301 and MD 5 at Mattawoman. The route was expanded to a four-lane divided highway and was taken over as MD 5's bypass of Waldorf in 1997.

5|$|Greene {{was again}} {{temporarily}} elevated to command of his division, now <b>designated</b> <b>part</b> of the XII Corps of the Army of the Potomac, at the Battle of Antietam. His division's three brigades {{were led by}} junior officers who had survived Cedar Mountain. Even though XII Corps commander Brig. Gen. Joseph K. Mansfield was killed shortly after the fighting began, Greene led a crushing attack against the Confederates near the Dunker Church, achieving the farthest penetration of Maj. Gen. Stonewall Jackson's lines than any Union unit. Under immense pressure, Greene held his small division (only 1,727 men engaged {{at the start of}} the day) in advance of the rest of the army for four hours, but eventually withdrew after suffering heavy losses. While the division was posted to Harpers Ferry, Greene took a three-week sick leave. Maj. Gen. Oliver O. Howard speculated that Greene, like many of his fellow officers, was sickened by the stench of dead and wounded at Antietam. When he returned, there was a new division commander, Brig. Gen. Geary. Greene was disgruntled that Geary, with only a few days seniority over him, was selected for the post; Geary had been wounded at Cedar Mountain and his combat record was not as good, but his political connections and a sentiment that a wounded officer should not be set back in his career unnecessarily, gave him the nod.|$|E
5|$|In 1960, MD 416 was {{designated}} concurrent with MD 2 between Solomons and Sunderland. In 1965, the MD 416 concurrency {{was replaced by}} an overlap with MD 4. Also, MD 2 was shifted to a new alignment between Sunderland and Owings, with the former route becoming MD 765. MD 2/MD 4 was widened to a divided highway between Huntingtown and the split in Sunderland in 1967. The divided highway was extended to south of Huntingtown in 1969, bypassing Huntingtown to the east. The former alignment through the community became MD 524. In 1970, MD 2/MD 4 became a divided highway between Prince Frederick and south of Huntingtown. In January 1978, MD 4 was rerouted north of Solomons onto the Governor Thomas Johnson Bridge over the Patuxent River. In 1979, the divided highway was extended south from Prince Frederick to Port Republic. MD 2/MD 4 was shifted west to a new divided highway between south of St. Leonard to Port Republic in 1981, with the former two-lane routing <b>designated</b> <b>part</b> of MD 765. In 1987, MD 2/MD 4 between Solomons and south of St. Leonard was shifted to a new divided highway. The bypassed alignment through Lusby and Solomons became another part of MD 765.|$|E

25|$|Within Europe, when {{driving a}} vehicle with right-traffic {{headlamps}} in a left-traffic country {{or vice versa}} for a limited time (as for example on vacation or in transit), it is a legal requirement to adjust the headlamps temporarily so that their wrong-side beam distribution does not dazzle oncoming drivers.

Some projector-type headlamps {{can be made to}} produce a proper left- or right-traffic beam by shifting a lever or other movable element in or on the lamp assembly.
