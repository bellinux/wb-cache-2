40|$|Continuous {{itinerary}} topologies {{in higher}} dimensions. (English summary) Topology Proc. 40 (2012), 131 – 153. With {{the use of}} itinerary topologies the author considers four closely related themes: (1) the classification of dynamical systems in which a system is described {{by means of a}} certain amount of combinatorial data, called the <b>kneading</b> <b>set</b> (the analogue of the kneading sequence in one dimension); (2) the reconstruction of a dynamical system (or a similar one) using only the combinatorial information which describes it; (3) the investigation of how information about the <b>kneading</b> <b>set</b> can lead to information about the original dynamical system; (4) the attempt to determine conditions which decide whether or not a given collection of combinatorial data can be the <b>kneading</b> <b>set</b> for a dynamical system of some desired type...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. According to the {{characteristics}} of solid propellant <b>kneading</b> machine, a <b>set</b> of wireless temperature measurement system is designed. In the system, the temperature signal is collected by three sets of temperature sensors and AT 89 C 55, then the signal is transmitted through NRF 2401 +, which is the wireless transceiver module, at last, the single-chip communicate with the remote host through the RS 232. Proved by experiments, the system have some advantages, such as the designed of the simple circuit, easy data transfer, multiple simultaneous acquisition, real-time good and remote monitoring...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this research}} was to evaluate the physical and mechanical properties of composites of Wood Flour (WF) and Recycle Polypropylene (RPP) prepared under various WF contents, WF sizes and modifier contents. WF from mixed-soft wood species and Eucalyptus deglupta Blume species were used as filler. The composites composed of 0 - 70 % WF, 0 - 70 % Polypropylene (PP) or RPP, various sizes of WF (60 - 80; 80 - 100 and < 120 mesh), various contents of MAH modifier (0, 1, 2. 5, 5, 7. 5 and 10 %) and 15 % Dicumyl Peroxide (DCP) initiator (based on MAH weight). <b>Kneading</b> conditions were <b>set</b> at 170 °C, 10 - 50 rpm for 15 min. The physical and mechanical properties of composites were greatly affected by WF content, WF size and modifier content. The greater the WF loading resulted in the greater was the reduction of tensile strength and breaking elongation values {{and at the same time}} the greater was the increasing of Young`s modulus value. The smaller the WF size resulted in the greater the tensile strength of composites. Addition of MAH modifier improved the physical and mechanical properties of composites. WF-RPP composites with 120 mesh WF size and 2. 5 % MA modifier had tensile strength, breaking elongation and Young`s modulus about 2. 15, 2. 27 and 1. 18 times, respectively higher compared with composites free-MAH modifier and absorbed considerably less water. Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) indicated that addition of MAH improved the adhesion between WF and RPP...|$|R
