500|$|Burton {{insisted that}} the film be bloody, as he felt stage {{versions}} of the play which {{cut back on the}} bloodshed robbed it of its power. For him, [...] "Everything is so internal with Sweeney that [...] is like his emotional release. It's more about catharsis than it is a literal thing." [...] Producer Richard D. Zanuck said that [...] " [...] had a very clear plan that he wanted to lift that up into a surreal, almost Kill Bill kind of stylization. We had done tests and experiments with the neck slashing, with the blood popping out. I remember saying to Tim, 'My God, do we dare do this?'" [...] On set, the fake blood was colored orange to render correctly on the desaturated color film used, and crew members wore bin liners to avoid getting stained while filming. This macabre tone made some studios nervous, and it was not until Warner Bros., DreamWorks and Paramount had signed up for the project that the film's $50 million budget was covered. Burton said [...] "the studio was cool about it and they accepted it because they knew what the show was.

The video which was uploaded to YouTube went viral. Powers of Los Angeles Times discussed about the incidents, saying: [...] "As a pop queen, Beyoncé is almost too perfect.
