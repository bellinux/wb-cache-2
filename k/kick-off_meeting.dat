40|$|MBA thesisSouth Africa is {{estimated}} to have 2. 5 -trillion worth of mineral resources. The development of the assets to extract these resources is critical for the economic success of the country. Despite {{the fact that there}} have been major improvements in the project process, many projects continue to fail. Contracts are a critical tool for project execution as they are the means by which projects utilise resources to achieve their objectives. Limited research has been conducted into the impact of contract administration on project management success and the contract administration actions required to support project management success. This research aims to assist in filling this gap. A structured interview was conducted on a case study, the AngloAmerican Sishen South project. This project aimed to develop a 9 million ton per annum iron ore mine. A cross section of project members was chosen as participants in the interviews. Contract administration does impact the project schedule, project costs and project scope and thus the project management success. In line with literature, effective contract administration needs to incorporate scope management, performance management, document control and dispute resolution to positively impact project management success. In addition to these, the research highlights effective contract <b>kick-off</b> <b>meetings,</b> training of contract administration staff and continuous improvement as contract administration actions that are also needed to positively impact project management success. Project managers should view contract administration as an important project management tool that contributes towards to project management success. The contract administration team should be expected to contribute towards managing the project’s schedule, costs and scope...|$|R
40|$|The {{two main}} {{goals of the}} European Commission’s Initiative on Breast Cancer (ECIBC) are to develop the European {{guidelines}} for breast cancer screening and diagnosis (European Breast Guidelines) {{and to develop a}} voluntary European Quality Assurance scheme for Breast Cancer Services (the European QA scheme). The present report describes the kick-off and the second meeting of the two working groups established within the initiative to develop the guidelines and the European QA scheme, the Guidelines Development Group (GDG) and the Quality Assurance Scheme Development Group (QASDG), respectively. The two working groups were set up based on a Call for Expression of Interest organised by the Directorate-General for Health and Food Safety (DG SANTE). Thirty-four members for each working group were nominated in July 2015. The GDG includes individual citizens and patients, clinicians and methodology experts; the QASDG includes individual citizens and patients, clinicians and healthcare quality & safety experts. This is to ensure that a person-centred, while scientifically robust, process is followed for developing the European Breast Guidelines and the European QA scheme. The <b>kick-off</b> <b>meetings</b> were held at the Joint Research Centre (JRC) premises in Ispra (Italy), on 7 - 9 September, 2015 for the GDG and 9 - 11 September, 2015 for the QASDG. The second set of meetings were held in Baveno (Italy) on 9 - 11 December 2015, back-to-back with the ECIBC 2015 Plenary. The meetings were dedicated to the introduction to the ECIBC project, the definition of the groups' working modalities and the draft scope of the European Breast Guidelines and of the European QA scheme. The first recommendations from the European Breast Guidelines and the draft European QA scheme are expected to be available starting from 2017. JRC. F. 1 -Health in Societ...|$|R

40|$|This report {{presents}} a study {{made at the}} Centre of Excellence Design for Robustness at GKN Aerospace AB (GAS) in Trollhättan, Sweden. GAS is a first-tier supplier in the global aerospace industry and manufactures components within the main product areas of civil and military aircraft as well as space propulsion including nozzles and turbines. In the increasingly competitive global market the need to identify proactive working methods within product development and ways to measure these has increased. The study has mainly addressed lessons learned and how these are brought back from the manufacturing department to the design function {{in order to provide}} a greater understanding of what manufacturing capabilities the process can handle. This research has been conducted as a case study, including thirteen interviews conducted at GAS and three benchmarking interviews in collaboration with SCA, SKF and Volvo Construction Equipment. The interviews together with a review of internal documentation and relevant literature showed that lessons learned are handled in different ways among the compared companies, that they all consider it to be an important improvement area but also that they have reached different performance levels. It was concluded that the main critical success factors that contributed to a favourable project outcome were the choice of material and the extent of the interdepartmental collaboration in terms of working proximity between the manufacturing and design departments, the extent of the collaboration between them and the empowerment of the manufacturing function within the project group. Five main recommendations were made in the study and arranged in short-, medium- and long-term according to their feasibility of implementation. First, GAS should standardize the team setup practices developed in project D to deal with design related failures. Second, GAS is advised to structure the spread of project-to-project learning around <b>kick-off</b> <b>meetings,</b> knowledge brokers, post-project reviews and lessons learned documents. Third, GAS is recommended to establish a core FMEA addressing the most critical factors for a specific manufacturing method where it can be universally applied as a starting point. Additionally, their current efforts in using QFD should be expanded to include all four houses of quality in order to fully connect the customer requirements to the process controls. Fourth, it is suggested to explore noise factors and sources of unwanted variation to deal with robustness failures. Lastly, several possibilities for improving the IT system were also mentioned, such as having a system bringing together all technical documentation in order to provide full traceability...|$|R
