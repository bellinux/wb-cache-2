5|$|Early {{tropical}} cyclone computer models anticipated Mireille would pass close to Guam, prompting officials to undergo {{preparations for the}} storm. The storm ultimately passed north of Saipan, causing damage along the island's northern portion. Mireille <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> trees and damaged over 70% of Saipan's crops while also eroding coastal roads.|$|E

If the bottle is <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> and the die knocked onto the table, the player is awarded points equal to whatever side of the die lies facing upward when the die comes to a stop. This adds a random effect to hitting the bottle and in practice often results in players only striking the bottle in combination with other point-scoring shots.|$|E
5|$|After {{reaching}} peak intensity, Debby slowly weakened, and {{was between}} Category2 and 1 when it passed south of Newfoundland early on September19. Thereafter, the storm accelerated and was moving at roughly 60mph (95km/h) towards the east. Debby was rapidly approaching the British Isles on September20, shortly before it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone. Overall, impact was minor in the Lesser Antilles, with only light to moderate rainfall in Dominican Republic, Puerto Rico, and the United States Virgin Islands. On Bermuda, high winds caused some power outages and <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> trees, though {{damage on the}} island was minimal. In addition, Debby dropped rainfall and produced moderately strong winds on Newfoundland.|$|E
5|$|In Massachusetts, the {{hurricane}} moved from Connecticut through the Springfield area. There {{was a small}} F1 tornado in Middlesex County that damaged trees. High winds <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> thousands of trees, and about 500,000 people statewide lost power. Heavy rainfall caused stream flooding, although the heaviest damage was from the winds. The hurricane destroyed a radio tower in Framingham and damaged hundreds of homes in the eastern portion of the state. Along the coast, the storm tide caused minor coastal flooding and damaged hundreds of boats. Across Massachusetts, damage was estimated at $61 million, including $6 million from crop damage.|$|E

5|$|In New Hampshire, the {{hurricane}} produced winds gusts {{of up to}} 38mph (61km/h) and around 1inch (25mm) of rain along the coast. In Maine, heavy surf closed several beaches and injured two people. Waves also damaged several boats. Winds were moderate near the coast, peaking at 47mph (76km/h) with gusts to 54mph (87km/h) at Mount Desert Island. The winds <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> several trees and caused sporadic power outages throughout the state, including loss of power for 1,900 Portland residents. In Kittery, water fell through an office building, damaging computer equipment. Rainfall was minor, peaking at 1.23inches (31.24mm) in Eastport.|$|E
5|$|In match race mode, {{the player}} competes {{in a series}} of races against AI-controlled snowboarders. The game times the player {{throughout}} the level and players receive a damage meter which fills if the snowboarder falls down or is <b>knocked</b> <b>over.</b> The difficulty level in match races can be set to easy, medium, or hard, adjusting the complexity and number of races. If the player fails at defeating an AI competitor, they must retire. The player is given three chances to beat the computer before the game is over.|$|E
5|$|Johnston then <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> Charlie Barnett's stumps as the batsman leaned {{onto the}} front foot and inside edged the ball into his stumps for eight; this brought Godfrey Evanswho was given two livesto the crease at 6/60. Evans hit Johnston hard {{in the air to}} cover, where the ball went through Bradman for a boundary. The second {{catching}} opportunity went in the same direction before traveling through Bradman's hand and striking him in the abdomen. However, Johnston eventually snared Evans, who hit a ball strongly, but straight to short leg where Arthur Morris took the catch close in, as England reached 8/74.|$|E

5|$|Returning to Australia, Edwards {{became the}} Australian Representative for Selection Trust. In 1966 his wife, Cherry, died; he married Dorothy Carew Berrick in 1972. The pair {{were said to}} {{complement}} each other well, as Dorothy limped on her left leg after being <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> by a car on a crosswalk in Sydney in 1970, while Edwards limped with his right after his flying accident in 1938. In 1974, Edwards relinquished his position as the Australian Representative for Selection Trust and was appointed Governor of Western Australia. He was sworn in on 7 January 1974, and appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) the following October.|$|E
5|$|Toshack {{returned}} {{for the final}} county match against Sussex before the First Test. He did not take a wicket but pinned down the local batsmen as Lindwall blasted them out with match figures of 11/59. Eight of Lindwall's victims had their stumps <b>knocked</b> <b>over.</b> Toshack bowled 15 overs for 23 runs in the first innings as the hosts were skittled for 86. He did not bat as Australia made 5/549 and then returned in the second innings for 17 overs that yielded only three scoring shots {{for a total of}} six runs. He finished the match with a total of 0/29 from 32 overs.|$|E
5|$|Due to its unusual nature, both heavy {{snowfall}} {{and strong}} winds caused {{a swath of}} devastation stretching from the Mid-Atlantic states to northern New England. In the Middle-Atlantic region, moderate damage occurred at sea but little was noted inland. In New England, strong gusts inflicted significant damage to numerous churches. Widespread residential damage, in contrast, was mostly negligible and had no lasting consequences. Thousands of trees were <b>knocked</b> <b>over,</b> obstructing roads and fiscally damaging the timber industry throughout the region. Cold temperatures, wet snow, and high winds downed numerous branches in fruit orchards, froze potato crops, flattened dozens of barns, and killed over a hundred cattle. In general, the agriculture, shipping, timber, and livestock trades suffered most acutely following {{the passage of the}} snow hurricane, while structural damage was widespread but generally inconsequential.|$|E

5|$|In Acapulco, {{the storm}} {{produced}} strong waves and heavy rain, leaving coastal streets {{with up to}} 16inches (405mm) of water. The heavy rainfall flooded 200houses and caused a mudslide, resulting {{in the death of}} a seven-year-old boy. Flooding also occurred at the airport in Acapulco, though service was not interrupted. Offshore, strong waves capsized a boat, leaving one person missing. Heavy rainfall in the port of Lázaro Cárdenas, Michoacán, overflowed a canal, forcing over 500people to evacuate their homes. 500acres (2km2) of crops were destroyed by Lane in Michoacán. Road and airport damage in Colima totaled to about $30million (2006MXN, $2.7million 2006USD). In Cajón de Peña, Jalisco, rainfall totaled to 7.36inches (187mm). One man died in Pueblos Unidos after being <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> by strong winds. Throughout Jalisco, 109people had to evacuate their homes due to landslides and heavy rainfall.|$|E
5|$|Julius Mutekanga was {{eliminated}} {{in the first}} round of the 800 metres while Abraham Kiplimo and Geofrey Kusuro similarly were unable to advance to final of the 5000 metres after finishing in a non-qualifying position. Jacob Araptany also did not progress to the final in the 3000 metres steeplechase while Kiplagat advanced to the later stages of the same event before being disqualified for changing to the track's inside line after being <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> by another athlete. Kispiro made it to the 5000 metres final as the slowest qualifier and secured a fifteenth-place finish, and took a tenth-position result in the 10,000 metres despite falling onto the track's surface. Thomas Ayeko finished in sixteenth in the same event. Kiprotich won the men's marathon, securing Uganda's first gold medal since 1972.|$|E
5|$|Leon of the Table D'hote is a 1910 American silent short comedy {{produced}} by the Thanhouser Company. The film follows Leon, a waiter at a table d'hote restaurant who {{is in love with}} Rosa, a French cashier at the same restaurant. Leon goes on vacation and poses as a foreign noble, attracts the interest of Violet Hope's mother as a suitable candidate to marry her daughter. While at the beach, Leon is <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> by a breaking wave and Violet rescues him, earning Leon's gratitude. Rosa arrives after tracking Leon down and forces him to confess and return to the restaurant. Violet's mother then allows her daughter to marry the man of her choice. No cast or staff credits are known for the production. The film was released on October 4, 1910, and was met with praise by the reviewer of The New York Dramatic Mirror. The film is presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|Quinton, {{a student}} at the school {{mentioned}} before, calls his father after he sees the legless beggar man in his room at night. His father tells him that it was his imagination, goes back downstairs, but then screams. Quinton rushes down to find his father dead and his eyes turned red with blood. Doggett and Scully investigate this latest death after the police tell them about the strange man the boy saw. While discussing the lack of any damage to the body except the broken blood vessels in the eyes, Scully comes {{to the conclusion that the}} man is still inside the latest victim. She rushes to the morgue and finds the boy’s father with a distended belly. She cuts into him and then sees a hand emerge from the scalpel incision. After being temporarily <b>knocked</b> <b>over,</b> she follows a bloody trail, opens a door at the end of the trail, and finds no one there. Unbeknownst to her, however, the beggar is watching her.|$|E
5|$|Strong wind gusts downed nearly 1,500power {{lines and}} <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> 28 large high tension wire towers at {{a power plant}} in Mariel. As a result, {{more than half of}} the {{electricity}} customers in Havana Province were left without power for 12days after the storm, and all of Pinar del Río Province was without power for over 11days. Blackouts continued in areas where power returned. The power outages resulted in lack of drinking water for numerous people, including no potable water in the city of Havana for four days. As a result, the Cuban government sent water tanks to satisfy the short term need. Similarly, there was a lack of gas for cooking for over a week. However, one Cuban government official stated that it could take up to two months for basic utilities to be returned to many isolated villages.|$|E
5|$|The chariots {{themselves}} were modified war chariots, essentially wooden carts with two wheels {{and an open}} back, although chariots were by this time no longer used in battle. The charioteer's feet were held in place, but the cart rested on the axle, so the ride was bumpy. The most exciting part of the chariot race, {{at least for the}} spectators, was the turns at the ends of the hippodrome. These turns were very dangerous and often deadly. If a chariot had not already been <b>knocked</b> <b>over</b> by an opponent before the turn, it might be overturned or crushed (along with the horses and driver) by the other chariots as they went around the post. Deliberately running into an opponent to cause him to crash was technically illegal, but nothing could be done about it (at Patroclus' funeral games, Antilochus in fact causes Menelaus to crash in this way,) and crashes were likely to happen by accident anyway.|$|E
