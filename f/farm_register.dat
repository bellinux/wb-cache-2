Basic terminology of the registers is spotted and methodological differences between the Statistical <b>Farm</b> <b>Register</b> and Administrative <b>Farm</b> <b>Register</b> were delineated. A general model of the Statistical <b>Farm</b> <b>Register</b> was elaborated and main updating principles were emphasised.

40|$|Health {{organizations}} worldwide {{have advocated}} that treatment records {{be required to}} show that antibiotics are used prudently by veterinarians and farmers alike. In 2000, the French government passed legislation making a <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> mandatory for all farms that raise animals for food production. The <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> is a comprehensive record designed to track all animal movements, treatments, and veterinary interventions on the farm. We conducted a survey to assess the knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors of dairy farmers toward the <b>farm</b> <b>register,</b> with particular emphasis on recording of antibiotic treatments. The 43 farmers interviewed belonged to veterinary health cooperatives. All farmers correctly named an antibiotic or antibiotic preparation, yet only 2 recognized the 5 components of the <b>farm</b> <b>register.</b> Farmer attitudes toward the register were globally positive, even though they named {{a wide variety of}} constraints. Nevertheless, 72 % of farmers interviewed had a permanent health record, and approximately half had recorded either the last treatment (irrespective of drug class) or the last intramammary tube administered. Results were discussed in the light of health behavior change models that are applied in human medicine. We suggest that programs that seek compliance with the <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> should focus on educational interventions and bonus incentives...|$|E

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the attitudes associated with issues about the production of wheat. We have analyzed the responses of 130 wheat producers from the five counties of eastern Croatia, deliberately chosen from the <b>Farm</b> <b>Register.</b> The questionnaire contained several themes: Country-policy-agricultural production, Production Technology-Economy, Purchase of wheat and Wheat production and impact of EU accession. It appears that participants have the most positive attitudes in the aspect of Production Technology-Economy, and the most negative in the aspect of Country-policy-agricultural production. In the aspect of Production Technology-Economy, more positive attitudes have participants who work in economies with a large number of members (more than 5). Low to medium high positive significant correlations, found between certain aspects of attitudes about wheat production, suggest that the attitudes to all questions related to the production of wheat are similar. Older workers (age group 61 - 80 years) have a negative attitude to the aspects of Production Technology-Economy and Wheat production and impact of EU accession. Among the links between certain aspects of attitudes on wheat production with selected agroeconomics indicators, highlights the finding that some of these indicators are negatively associated with private ownership of land, and positively with the lease of the land, in separate aspects of Production Technology-Economy, Purchase wheat and Influence of entry into the EU...|$|E
40|$|The {{agricultural}} {{enterprise and}} income statistics describe farm income subject to taxation and the expenditure, assets and debts of farms, {{as well as}} changes in the fixed assets of farms. Income {{data were collected from}} the Tax Register and production sectors were received form the <b>Farm</b> <b>Register.</b> The challenge was to combine the two administrative registers with different register units into a statistical register in which a new statistical unit, an agricultural enterprise, was defined for the combined register. The definition of the new statistical unit was formed to correspond as well as possible with real units of the farm population. In addition, a statistical survey of agricultural enterprises was used to collect more detailed data from the sales of agricultural products and expenses. An exceptional feature was large item non-response because large farms seemed to have difficulties in answering a questionnaire. The statistical register of agricultural enterprises was used to complete partially filled questionnaires. In most cases, simple ratio imputation was used but for farmers with several different products multiple imputation was applied. After imputation, the item nonresponse group was accepted as respondents in the final data, when response rates rose to 76 %- 79 %. The response behaviour of nonresponse was studied using the variables of the statistical register. Sample design contained a rotating panel in which a half of the sample remained the same in successive years. The data collection is automated by building the questionnaire into the bookkeeping software that decreases the farmers' response burden in future, and automation of sending a questionnaire via the Internet is expected to enhance the number of respondents. In estimation processes, the register data were used as an auxiliary information to adjust nonresponse bias and to increase accuracy...|$|E
40|$|The {{tracking}} {{of the land}} use/land cover changes {{that took place in}} Essexdale Farm (a communal resettlement area in Marondera District of Zimbabwe) from the period 1985 to 2012 was conducted using the two methods: the Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) Trend Analysis and the calculation of changes in proportions of the land use/land cover classes. Four land classes: woodland, cropland, wooded grassland and wetland, were considered. The analysis of the stakeholder management framework was conducted using both the formal and informal survey methods to offer an explanation for the observed trends in the land cover changes. The NDVI Trend Analysis results revealed that there is evidence of woodland and wetland degradation as was shown by the decrease in the NDVI values of the corresponding land classes from 1985 to 2012. There was however insignificant change in the trend analysis of the cropland and wooded grassland land classes. There was a general increase in the proportion of land under woodland from 1985 to 2012. However the effects of the Fast Track Land Reform process were evidenced by an increase in the proportion of the cropland at the expense the woodland. Deforestation was identified by the stakeholders to be the main environmental problem and its contributing factors being the cutting down of trees for tobacco curing, clearing land for cultivation, selling of firewood to neighbouring towns and poverty. The clearing of land for cultivation under the post 2000 era, during the Government of Zimbabweâ€™s Fast-Track Resettlement Programme, emerged as the main contributing factor. It was also noticed that the conversion of the woodland to cropland and wooded grassland was more pronounced from 2000 to 2005 than was for 2006 to 2012. It was observed that there are now more than 265 families on Essexdale Farm, a figure which is almost double the carrying capacity of 136 families pegged by the land use planners in the Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement, Marondera district. There are also illegal settlers (who are not recorded in the official <b>farm</b> <b>register</b> at the District Offices) farming on marginal land. The suggested possible solutions to the environmental challenges were tree planting, environmental education and awareness campaigns and firebreak construction, as well as strict environmental law enforcement. It was noted that the practicability and the effectiveness of these environmental management strategies would only be realised in a well managed sustainable stakeholder framework. This would demand the necessary political will to initiate institutional reforms and restructuring, with the major move being to shift the A 1 land resettlement mandate from the Ministry of Local Government Rural and Urban Development to the more accountable Ministry of Lands and Rural Resettlement {{to deal with the problem}} of illegal resettlements. Capacity building of the individual farmers, local leadership and staff of all the government institutes would greatly benefit the conservation initiatives, with the major task of coordinating these efforts lying with the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources Management...|$|E

50|$|Besides {{fish and}} crustaceans, turtles (primarily, the Chinese Soft-shelled Turtle Pelodiscus sinensis) have been {{extensively}} farmed as well since the 1980s and 1990s. Based on a 2002 survey of 684 turtle farms, researchers estimated that these farms had the total herd {{of more than}} 300 million animals; they sold over 128 million turtles each year, with the total weight of about 93,000 tons, worth around US$750 million. Since these data are based on {{less than half of}} all turtle <b>farms</b> <b>registered</b> with the appropriate regulating agencies (i.e., 684 out of 1,499), it was estimated that the overall herds and production amounts are at least twice as high.|$|R
