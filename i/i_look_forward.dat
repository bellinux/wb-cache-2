25|$|Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina {{issued a}} {{statement}} to congratulate Trump, saying: I am confident that under your leadership, the existing bilateral relation between our two friendly nations would be further strengthened. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working closely with you for advancing our bilateral and multilateral interests and contributing to create a safe and secured world, where our coming generations could live and continue to prosper peacefully. I cordially invite you and Mrs Melania Trump to visit Bangladesh at a mutually convenient time and see for yourself the phenomenal development {{that took place in}} Bangladesh in the recent years.|$|E
25|$|Prime Minister Frank Bainimarama congratulated Trump, {{while also}} taking the {{opportunity}} to emphasise that action on climate change is a priority for Fiji: Fiji has {{a close relationship with}} the United States and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with you and your administration in the months and years ahead. We especially seek America's support in our struggle against the extreme weather events and rising sea levels caused by climate change, which pose a particular threat to the Pacific islands and other low lying areas of the world. We also look forward to working with you to protect our oceans and seas from the threat of pollution and overfishing. With every best wish as you prepare to assume the presidency.|$|E
25|$|During the 2012 presidential {{election}} primary campaign, Romney called Arizona’s approach to illegal immigration “a {{model for the}} nation.” He vowed that {{on his first day}} in office as president, he would {{bring an end to the}} lawsuits the Obama Administration’s Justice Department had brought challenging Arizona’s immigration policy. He also praised the anti-illegal immigration efforts of Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, a law professor who had drafted much of Arizona’s SB 1070 immigration enforcement law and similar measures around the country. Campaigning with Kobach in January 2012, Romney said, “We need more conservative leaders like Kris willing to stand up for the rule of law. With Kris on the team, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with him to take forceful steps to curtail illegal immigration and to support states like South Carolina and Arizona that are stepping forward to address this problem.” When the Supreme Court struck down parts of Arizona's SB 1070 in June 2012, a Romney campaign spokesman said that Romney supports the rights of states to make their own immigration laws when the federal government has failed to address illegal immigration.|$|E

500|$|Regarding Metrobus improvements, General Manager Sarles reported, [...] "Bus {{service will}} benefit from new {{technology}} that integrates fare box, destination signage and next bus systems to improve our reliability and customer information delivery. And, we will begin work in certain priority bus corridors that will deliver faster travel times for bus customers. Additionally, <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with the District of Columbia on potential bus rapid transit service improvements, such as curb running and signal preference to make bus service even more attractive, efficient, and an even more powerful antidote to traffic congestion." ...|$|E

500|$|The episode {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from television critics. Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an A– grade. John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a largely positive review and awarded it an 8 out of 10. He wrote, [...] "Overall, {{this was an}} uneven yet highly enjoyable mythology episode, far better than the episode {{that appears to have}} spawned it ('Trustno1') [...] <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to whatever directorial/writing work David Duchovny might do in the future. And if this is indeed the last we see of William, well, I’m not going to complain! Still, by now, Carter and Spotnitz ought to know how to write an episode with the time constraints in mind." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1989, Young Guns film {{director}} Christopher Cain optioned {{the rights to}} Final Blackout and developed a script for a possible film-version of the book. The film was not made. [...] According to the Church of Scientology company Bridge Publications, Cain signed a contract to write a screenplay {{based on the book}} and to direct the film. [...] "The book is massive in scope and transcends time. It's a powerful look at the idiocy and futility of war. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to making 'Final Blackout' into a major movie," [...] said Cain in a press release put out by Bridge Publications. An audiobook was released by Bridge Publications in 1991 and read by Planet of the Apes actor Roddy McDowall, who also voiced audiobook versions of Hubbard's novels Battlefield Earth and Fear.|$|E
500|$|In view of {{the return}} of the Oscars to Hollywood, the Academy hired film {{producer}} and Sony Pictures Entertainment chairman Laura Ziskin in September 2001 to oversee production of the telecast. AMPAS president Frank Pierson explained the decision to hire Ziskin saying, [...] "This show {{is one of the most}} difficult—if not the most difficult—producing jobs in show business. Laura Ziskin brings intelligence, experience and wit expressed in everything she has done." [...] This marked the first occurrence that a woman produced the Oscars solo. Four months later, Whoopi Goldberg was selected as host of the 2002 ceremony. In an article in the Los Angeles Times, Ziskin justified her choice of Goldberg commenting that she has [...] "great warmth, with humor, humanity and social conscience, all qualities that I feel are essential for this year's show. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to collaborating with Whoopi to put on a meaningful and entertaining evening." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{courtesy}} and chivalry of Crillon attracted much admiration {{during his lifetime}} and afterwards. As the English anecdotist William Seward put it in 1798, [...] "Courtesy, no less than courage, was always the appenage {{of the family of}} Crillon". During the siege of Gibraltar, he sent his English opponent General George Eliott a gift of fruits, vegetables and game, along with some ice, which he presumed [...] "will not be disagreeable in the excessive heat of this climate at this season of the year." [...] He expressed his [...] "pleasure to which <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> of becoming your friend, after I shall have learned to render myself worthy of the honour, by facing you as an enemy." [...] Five years later, when his old adversary Eliott was promoted to the peerage and became Lord Heathfield, Crillon wrote to his [...] "dear and respectable enemy", whom he now considered a friend, to offer his congratulations.|$|E
500|$|The most {{well-documented}} early European {{team was}} founded by activist Nettie Honeyball in England in 1894. It was named the British Ladies' Football Club. Nettie Honeyball is quoted, [...] "I founded the association late last year , with the fixed resolve of proving {{to the world that}} women are not the 'ornamental and useless' creatures men have pictured. I must confess, my convictions on all matters where the sexes are so widely divided are all on the side of emancipation, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to the time when ladies may sit in Parliament and have a voice in the direction of affairs, especially those which concern them most." [...] Honeyball and those like her paved the way for women's football. However, the women's game was frowned upon by the British football associations, and continued without their support. It has been suggested that this was motivated by a perceived threat to the 'masculinity' of the game.|$|E
500|$|Forty-five {{cars were}} entered for {{qualifying}}, but only forty-three could {{qualify for the}} race because of NASCAR's qualifying procedure. Kahne clinched the 20th pole position of his career, {{with a time of}} 30.525 seconds. He was joined on the front row of the grid by Edwards. McMurray qualified third, Bill Elliott took fourth, and A. J. Allmendinger started fifth. Johnson, David Reutimann, Mark Martin, David Ragan and Regan Smith rounded out the top ten. Hamlin only managed 37th, having getting close to the wall. The two drivers that failed to qualify for the race were Patrick Carpentier, and Michael McDowell. Once the qualifying session completed, Kahne commented, [...] "That was the best qualifying run by far since I joined Red Bull. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to Sunday’s race. It’s going to be exciting being up front now, being in the mix with Denny , Kevin [...] and Jimmie [...] They’re all going to be fast throughout the race. I’m just glad we are so far.

500|$|In December 2011, Jenkins {{exited the}} project, citing [...] "creative differences". She stated, [...] "I {{have had a}} great time working at Marvel. We parted on very good terms, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to working with them again." [...] Jenkins felt she could not have made a good film [...] "out of Thor 2 because I wasn’t the right director... I could have made a great Thor if I could have done the story that I was wanting to do. But I don’t think I was the right person to make a great Thor out of the story they wanted to do." [...] Jenkins had {{intended}} to create a film based on the premise of Romeo and Juliet, where Jane was stuck on Earth with Thor forbidden to come save her. After Thor eventually does travel to Earth, he and Jane would have discovered that Malekith was [...] "hiding the dark energy inside of Earth because he knows that Odin doesn't care about Earth, and so he's using Odin's disinterest in Earth to trick him." ...|$|E
500|$|Kenny {{formed a}} {{minority}} government after securing {{the support of}} several Independent TDs, and on 19 May 2016, appointed McEntee as Minister of State for Mental Health and Older People. She was one of eighteen deputies to take up junior ministerial roles {{in the government of}} the 32nd Dáil, and one of four women to hold office as a junior minister; the others were Marcella Corcoran Kennedy (Minister of State for Health Promotion), Catherine Byrne (Minister of State for Communities and the National Drugs Strategy), and Regina Doherty (Government chief whip). Responding to the announcement McEntee said she was delighted to be appointed a junior minister. Her appointment was also welcomed by Dr. Shari McDaid, director of Mental Health Reform, a coalition of organisations that campaigns for improvements to mental health services in Ireland: [...] "The new Minister takes office {{at a time when there}} is widespread support for reform of Ireland’s mental health system. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to supporting her so that she can deliver better outcomes for children and adults who experience a mental health difficulty." ...|$|E
500|$|Recurring guest actors for {{the series}} Eugene Simon, Julian Glover, Roger Ashton-Griffiths, Finn Jones, and Ian Gelder, who portrayed Lancel Lannister, Pycelle, Mace Tyrell, Loras Tyrell, and Kevan Lannister, respectively, also made their final {{appearance}} in the series. Finn Jones, who was cast concurrently in the leading role for the upcoming television series Marvel's Iron Fist, spoke about his departure saying, [...] "I had been on Thrones for six years. It was yearly employment. Now I was at a crossroads and I had {{to think of what}} the future is. I was very blessed that something like this has come along at the right moment," [...] referring to Iron Fist. Eugene Simon also spoke about his learning of his departure, saying that the showrunners promised a [...] "huge scene" [...] for his character in the season finale, with Simon responding, [...] "for everything that you've done for the last six years, thank you. This is a wonderful way to go. I really, really appreciate it, and <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to doing it for you." ...|$|E

500|$|The 100m at the DN Galan {{meeting in}} Stockholm saw Gay's first match-up {{of the year}} against Bolt. He {{surprised}} the Olympic and World champion with a resounding victory, beating him with 9.84 to Bolt's 9.97seconds. This was {{only the second time}} Bolt had lost a 100m final – the first occurring in July 2008 against Powell (also at Stockholm Olympic Stadium). Gay broke Powell's stadium record and earned a one carat diamond for the feat. Gay chose not to overstate the significance of the win, acknowledging that Bolt was far from peak fitness: [...] "It feels great to beat Usain but deep down inside I know he is not 100%. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to beating him when he is". With Bolt and Powell both out with injuries, Gay won unchallenged at the London Grand Prix the following week, running a world leading time of 9.78seconds despite poor weather. A victory at the Memorial van Damme in 9.79seconds earned him the first Diamond Race Trophy for the 100m.|$|E
500|$|Katsura's {{participation}} in the 1952 World Three-Cushion Billiards title {{marked the first time}} that a woman had competed for any world billiards title. This was only ten years after Ruth McGinness became the first woman to have ever been invited to play in any men's professional billiard championship (the New York State Championship of 1942). The defending champion was the then 64-year-old internationally renowned Willie Hoppe, who would retire later that year with 51 world titles to his name between 1906 and 1952 in three forms of carom billiards, three-cushion, (four sub-disciplines of) balkline and cushion caroms. Before the tournament, speculation had it that when Hoppe met Katsura in the championship in the [...] to 50 points format, he would defeat her with Katsura still needing at least 40. After seeing her play, Hoppe said [...] "she has a fine stroke and can make shots with either hand. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to playing with her." [...] The public was fascinated by the novelty of a woman player. Life magazine reported that [...] "San Franciscans who did not know a cue from a cucumber crowded in to see her... Katy ... stole the show." ...|$|E
500|$|Parker was {{frequently}} compared to Derrick Rose in high school. According to Chicago Sun-Times writer Michael O'Brien, , Rose had a 3–0 advantage in defining moments: [...] "the back-to-back dunks against Washington {{in the city}} championship at the United Center, the game-winning shot in overtime to give Simeon the state championship against Peoria Richwoods and the dismantling of Oak Hill, the top-ranked team in the country." [...] Rose's game against the Oak Hill team with Brandon Jennings, Nolan Smith and Alex Legion on ESPN is described as Rose's national introduction. Although there are comparisons to Rose, his game is most often compared to Grant Hill and Paul Pierce. Dime Magazine describes him as [...] "Grant Hill with a jump shot". Parker claims to model his game after Paul Pierce and Carmelo Anthony. He hopes {{to be regarded as}} the best high school basketball player {{in the history of the}} city of Chicago and has stated that [...] "being compared to Derrick also drives me. I know if I get better than him or break the records he broke I could be one of the best players to come out of Chicago. <b>I</b> <b>look</b> <b>forward</b> to being one of those players." ...|$|E
