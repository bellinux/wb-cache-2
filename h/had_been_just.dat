5|$|ZANU-PF won a {{landslide}} victory, with 61% {{of the presidential}} vote and over two-thirds of parliamentary seats. The elections were not considered free and fair; there were widespread stories of vote rigging and many voters may have been fearful of the violence that had surrounded the 2008 election. During the campaign, many MDC supporters had remained quiet about their views {{out of fear of}} reprisals. The MDC was also negatively impacted by its time in coalition government, with perceptions that it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> as corrupt as ZANU-PF. ZANU-PF had also capitalised on its appeals to African race, land, and liberation, while the MDC was often associated with white farmers, Western nations, and perceived Western values such as LGBT rights.|$|E

25|$|Childcare {{facilities}} were also expanded, {{with the number}} of places in crèches rising steadily between 1981 and 1986. In addition, the minimum wage was significantly increased. From 1981 to 1984, the SMIC rose by 125%, while prices went up by only 75% during that same period. Various measures were also introduced to mitigate the effects of rising unemployment.

25|$|Callaghan {{introduced}} his next Budget on 4 May. He had informed {{the house that}} he would bring a full Budget to the House {{when he made his}} 'little budget' speech prior to the election. The main point of his budget was the introduction of a Selective Employment Tax, penalising the service industry and favouring the manufacturing industry. Twelve days after the budget, the National Union of Seamen called a national strike and the problems facing Sterling were multiplied. Additional strikes caused the balance of payments deficit to increase and the 3.3billion loan was now due. Unemployment was also rising; it <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> over 300,000 when Labour came to power, but two years later it was climbed to more than 500,000.|$|E

25|$|In Western Australia's {{home match}} against Queensland that season, Price {{had a large}} role in a tense 19 runs win, despite coming into the side due to an injury. He took 5 for 68 in the first innings, with the fifth wicket coming from a hit wicket. Earlier in the innings, off his first three overs of the match, Price had three catches dropped off his bowling. Chasing 229 for victory, Queensland were well placed at 5-154, albeit with only 80 minutes {{remaining}} on the final day. After taking the new ball, Price dismissed all-rounder Colin McCool and wicket-keeper Ernest Toovey off successive deliveries. Queensland batsman Lawrence Chapman survived the hattrick but was trapped leg before wicket the very next ball to give Price a third wicket in the space of four balls. Price would secure the win soon after, dismissing Mick Raymer with just 16 minutes to spare, giving him a 10 wicket haul. It <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> his third first-class match for Western Australia and was the performance that secured a spot his spot in the team.|$|E

25|$|By {{the time}} Steve Davis {{won his first}} world title in 1981, there <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> ten world champions since 1927, with Davis {{becoming}} the eleventh, including {{the winner of the}} boycotted 1952 title, Horace Lindrum. Stephen Hendry became the fourteenth in 1990 and dominated through the 1990s. Reardon won six (1970, 1973–1976 and 1978), Davis also six (1981, 1983, 1984 and 1987–1989) and Hendry seven (1990, 1992–1996 and 1999). O'Sullivan is the closest to dominance in the modern era, having won the title on five occasions in the 21st century (2001, 2004, 2008, 2012 and 2013). Mark Williams has won twice (2000 and 2003) and John Higgins four times (1998, 2007, 2009, 2011) but {{since the beginning of the}} century, there has not been a dominant force like in previous decades, and the modern era has seen many players playing to a similar standard, instead of one player raising the bar. Davis for example, won more ranking tournaments than the rest of the top 64 players put together by 1985 and still holds the record for most tournament wins overall, at a time when there were far fewer tournaments than today. By retaining his title in 2013, O'Sullivan became the first player to successfully defend the world championship since 1996 when Hendry won the sixth of his seven titles, his fifth in a row.|$|E

500|$|In 1893, {{bimetallism}} <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> {{one of many}} proposals by Populists and others. [...] As {{the economic}} downturn continued, free silver advocates blamed its continuation on {{the repeal of the}} silver purchase act, and the issue of silver became more prominent. [...] Free silver especially resonated among farmers in the South and West, as well as miners. [...] June 1894 marked the publication of William H. Harvey's Coin's Financial School. [...] The book, composed of accounts of (fictitious) lectures on the silver issue given by an adolescent named Coin to Chicago audiences, became an immense bestseller. [...] The book included (as foils to the title character) many of Chicago's most prominent men of business; some, such as banker and future Secretary of the Treasury Lyman Gage, issued denials that they had participated in any such lectures. [...] This popular treatment of the currency issue was highly influential. [...] A Missourian, Ezra Peters, wrote to Illinois Senator John M. Palmer, [...] "Coins [...] Financial School is raising h— in this neck of the woods. [...] If those in favor of honest money don't do something to offset its influence the country is going to the dogs." [...] A Minnesota correspondent wrote in Outlook magazine: [...] "high school boys are about equally divided between silver and baseball, with a decided leaning toward the former".|$|E
500|$|Part of {{what made}} reform {{possible}} in Britain {{in the second}} half of the eighteenth century was the dramatic increase in publishing; books, periodicals, and pamphlets became much more widely available than they <b>had</b> <b>been</b> <b>just</b> a few decades earlier. This increase in available printed material helped facilitate the rise of the British middle class. Reacting against what they viewed as aristocratic decadence, the new professional middle classes (made prosperous through British manufacturing and trade), offered their own ethical code: reason, meritocracy, self-reliance, religious toleration, free inquiry, free enterprise, and hard work. They set these values against what they perceived as the superstition and unreason of the poor and the prejudices, censorship, and self-indulgence of the rich. They also helped establish what has come to be called the [...] "cult of domesticity", which solidified gender roles for men and women. This new vision of society rested on the writings of Scottish Enlightenment philosophers such as Adam Smith, who had developed a theory of social progress founded on sympathy and sensibility. A partial critique of the rationalist Enlightenment, these theories promoted a combination of reason and feeling that enabled women to enter the public sphere because of their keen moral sense. Wollstonecraft's writings stand at the nexus of all of these changes. Her educational works, such as her children's book Original Stories from Real Life (1788), helped inculcate middle-class values, and her two Vindications, A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), argue for the value of an educated, rational populace, specifically one that includes women. In her two novels, [...] and , she explores the ramifications of sensibility for women.|$|E
500|$|The next {{race was}} the Breeders' Cup Classic on November 1. Because many leading older horses retired in 2014, {{most of the}} main contenders for the 2014 Classic were the three year olds: in {{addition}} to California Chrome, former foes Bayern, Candy Boy and Tonalist entered. His chief rival {{was considered to be}} the then-undefeated American Champion Two-Year-Old Colt, Shared Belief, a gelding who missed the Triple Crown series due to hoof problems; the two had never faced each other. California Chrome was 4-1 on the morning line, second favorite to Shared Belief. In the race, Bayern bumped into Shared Belief at the start, then took the lead {{for the duration of the}} race. California Chrome was clear of traffic, maintained third place for most of the race, was closing at the end, and finished a very close third, only a neck behind winner Bayern, who won by a nose over second-place finisher Toast of New York. Shared Belief was fourth. Post race analysis noted that California Chrome stayed on the outside throughout the race, and actually ran 44 feet farther than the winner. [...] Sherman spoke in positive terms of the horse's finish, stating, [...] "My horse ran his eyeballs out. He was right there, right down to the money. I thought it was a great effort. He came back strong." [...] Espinoza was less enthusiastic: [...] "On the backstretch I thought I had a chance to win... The last sixteenth [...] was digging as hard as he could, but getting just a little tired. I wish he had one more race. It was a little too much for him today." [...] Coburn visited the colt the following day and stated, [...] "He was full of himself. I think he thought he won.
