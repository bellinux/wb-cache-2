5|$|Altar Q is {{the most}} famous {{monument}} at Copán. It was dedicated by king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat in AD776 and has <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> 16 kings of the Copán dynasty carved around its side. Each figure is depicted seated on his name glyph. A hieroglyphic text is inscribed on the upper surface, relating {{the founding of the}} dynasty in AD426427. On one side, it shows the dynastic founder K'inich Yax K'uk' Mo' transferring power to Yax Pasaj. Interestingly, Tatiana Proskouriakoff first discovered the inscription on the West Side of Altar Q that tells us the date of the inauguration of Yax Pasaj. This portrayal of political succession tells us much about Early Classic Maya culture.|$|E
5|$|Ceolnoth, Archbishop of Canterbury {{throughout}} Æthelwulf's reign, also minted coins {{of his own}} at Canterbury: {{there were}} three different portrait designs, thought to be contemporary with <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three of Æthelwulf's Canterbury issues. These were followed by an inscribed cross design that was uniform with Æthelwulf's final coinage.

On 5 September 2009, one week before the programme's first episode aired, the group announced on the YouTube channel ChartJackersProject their intention to release a number one single within their ten-week time frame. A different task would be undertaken each week, so that, {{by the end of the}} project, the song would be completed.|$|E

Qualifying {{consisted of three}} parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two sessions. Only the two Mercedes drivers were capable of proceeding into {{the second part of}} qualifying (Q2) without having to use the faster, soft tyres.

Those were both Marussia drivers, the Sauber of Marcus Ericsson and Fernando Alonso for McLaren.|$|E
5|$|Dickov {{retained}} {{his place}} in the first team {{at the start of the}} 1999–2000 season.

The run of starting appearances came to an end on 27 October, when he damaged knee ligaments in a match against Ipswich Town. During the subsequent absence, Manchester City signed Robert Taylor, and most of Dickov's appearances in the second half of the season were as a substitute. One of these substitute appearances was the final match of the season, a 4–1 win at Blackburn. Dickov scored the third Manchester City goal as City clinched promotion to the Premier League.|$|E

The name, like the names of <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> seven {{satellites}} of Saturn to be discovered, was suggested by William Herschel's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope. He chose these names because Saturn, known in Greek mythology as Cronus, {{was the leader of}} the Titans.|$|E
5|$|Hunt {{scored a}} try in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two {{games of the}} season.

They'll then use their judgement to predict the outcome or have their powers of observation tested. Either way, the contestants must strike their buzzer and pick either red or black.|$|E
5|$|In {{the final}} non-conference game the 2012 season, Alabama {{shut out the}} Western Carolina Catamounts 49–0 in Tuscaloosa.

5|$|On April 2, 2011, Kinsler {{became the}} first player in major league history to hit a lead-off {{home run in the}} first two games of a season (giving him a total of 15 lead-off homers in his career). In his next game against the Red Sox, he hit another home run in the third inning. Kinsler and Nelson Cruz also {{became the first}} two {{teammates}} to homer in <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> three games in a season. The two also joined Dean Palmer (1992) as the only Texas ballplayers to ever homer in the first three games of the season.|$|E
5|$|Originally, the French {{team were}} {{scheduled}} to play a team from the United States, but the latter withdrew from the competition as three of their team were {{taking place in the}} hammer throw at the same time. The Scandinavians were accepted as late entrants by the organisers, and their team was composed primarily of athletes who were competing in other events, though it also included a journalist, Edgar Aabye, to make up the numbers. The mixed team won <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two pulls against the French in a best-of-three contest to win the gold medal. Due to a second, unofficial, match subsequently taking place between the United States and the Scandinavians, some records have erroneously listed the United States as gold medalists.|$|E
5|$|Qualifying {{consisted}} of three parts, 18, 15 and 12 minutes in length respectively, with five drivers eliminated from competing after <b>each</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>first</b> two sessions.

Jenson Button, who had problems with his car all during practice, was unable to set a time when his car broke down on his out lap. Lewis Hamilton set the fastest time, with Valtteri Bottas in second. Along with Button, both Manor Marussia cars were eliminated in Q1, as well as Daniil Kvyat– who made a mistake during his final lap– and Pastor Maldonado. Fernando Alonso was the first driver to reach a second qualifying session for McLaren {{over the course of}} the season.|$|E
