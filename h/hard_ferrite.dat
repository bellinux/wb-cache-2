Although the decrease was uniform across the frequency range and noise also dropped the same amount, preserving the dynamic range, the decrease misaligned Dolby noise reduction decoders that were sensitive to level settings. The chrome coating was harder than competitive coatings, and that led to accusations of excessive head wear. Although the tape wore <b>hard</b> <b>ferrite</b> heads faster than oxide based tapes, it actually wore softer permalloy heads at a slower rate; and head wear was more a problem for permalloy heads than for ferrite heads. The head wear scare and licensing issues with DuPont kept blank consumer chrome tapes at a great disadvantage versus the eventually more popular Type II tapes that used cobalt-modified iron oxide, but chrome was the tape of choice for the music industry's cassette releases.

This review deals with the various hard materials now in production, illustrated by a few new laboratory results. If the old theory of pinned Bloch walls, initially developed for magnet steels, comes back again for cobalt-rare earths alloys substituted with copper and iron, the origin of the properties of most modern hard materials is interpreted in terms of single domain fine — particle theory : in one case, magnetization reversal is governed, either by a shape anisotropy (Ticonals, powder magnets) or a crystal anisotropy (platinum-cobalt alloy, <b>hard</b> <b>ferrites)</b> — in the other case, it is governed by nucleation of reversed domains or unpinning of Bloch walls (sintered cobalt-rare earths magnets). The study of first magnetization curves, as well as intrinsic curves or recoil curves, is very useful to distinguish between various mechanisms of coercivity, and is illustrated here by new results obtained on high coercivity materials, as Ticonal 2000 ((BHmax) = 6. 5 × 106 G.
