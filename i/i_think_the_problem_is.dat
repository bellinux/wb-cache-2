The book received negative reaction from critics, conservative and feminist anti-porn groups, due to its sexually explicit photographs which many characterized as hardcore pornography. Taraborrelli opined that much of the book appears surprising and not shocking. He derided the whole concept as childish and impetuous rather than an adult book. According to him, though Madonna insisted that she was trying to demystify sexuality altogether, the author believed she just wanted to publish pornographic text and pictures and get away with it. [...] "She was being a brat, not a revolutionary", the author concluded. Author Lucy OBrien declared that the book was a bold, harrowing exercise in frustration, and despite Madonnas attempt at invincibility, the book appeared as [...] "a curious act of self-destruction". [...] "The overwhelming effect of the book is numbing," [...] stated Anthony DeCurtis of Rolling Stone. [...] "The images are derivative, and Madonna herself seems far too eager to shock; that, not even prurient arousal, seems the ideal response the book tirelessly seeks. The potency of Sexs subject matter is dissipated by Madonna and Meisels self-congratulatory - and silly - sense of their own bravery, as if their naughty games were somehow revolutionary." ...|$|E

During the Drowned World Tour of 2001, Madonna was asked whether she had really sent the book for Morton's well-being. She replied sarcastically: [...] "Why yes, I always send bibles and philosophy books to my biographers." [...] Motioning to her then husband Guy Ritchie she continued, [...] "Just ask my husband, he'll tell you that my greatest concern these days is not this fucking tour, or him or even our kids, why, it's Andrew Morton's spiritual enlightment of course."

I never saw a groom walk down an aisle with a bigger smile than Guy Ritchie," [...] adding that Morton's claims were a retread of [...] "tired old gossip. It's same old, same old."

In this installment of Building Security In, we’ll learn what this field can teach us. Diagnosis Software developers began building sophisticated Web applications in the mid 1990 s, using CGI and Perl scripts to connect their users to databases and back-end content. Even back then, security people knew immediately that security would be an issue—after all, developers were publishing back-end content from their core business databases and applications onto the Web and letting users post content there as well. In response, the security industry moved as never before or since to build and deploy two security mechanisms. The first was a network firewall to keep the “good stuff ” (enterprise data and functionality) separate from the “bad stuff ” (the Internet). The second mechanism was the SSL to encrypt the link from the user’s Web browser to, ideally, the Web server. What happened next was the dotcom boom—businesses figured out that they could make buckets of money on the Web, developers began innovating feverishly, Web applications became more sophisticated and personalized, and s...|$|R
40|$|Training {{farmers to}} tackle Newcastle disease Cue: Newcastle {{disease is a}} killer disease in poultry flocks all over the world. Young {{chickens}} are particularly vulnerable, and outbreaks can easily cause 100 % mortality. Apart from a sudden high number of deaths, symptoms of the disease include paralysis, breathing difficulties and green diarrhoea. To prevent {{spread of the disease}} all birds should be vaccinated, with chicks needing a double dose of vaccine, once during their first week and a second dose after two months. Vaccines are usually given in drinking water, but to be effective farmers must know exactly how much water to mix the vaccine with. Timing of vaccination in adult birds also needs to be carefully controlled, since outbreaks of the disease are often linked to seasonal changes in the climate. For this reason, if poultry farmers are to vaccinate their own birds, they usually need training from livestock officers. In The Gambia, such training has been provided by the Department of Livestock Services from its poultry unit in Abuko. Mr Demba Touray, a livestock assistant at the unit, recently spoke to Ismaila Senghore about the disease, and attempts by the Department to control it. IN:		?Well it?s drastic because it is a disease? OUT:		?. farmers are doing it on their own. ? DUR?N		 4 ? 34 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Mr. Demba Touray on how the Gambian Department of Livestock Services has been helping farmers to tackle Newcastle disease in their poultry flocks. Transcript Touray	Well it?s drastic because it is a disease that can wipe out your whole flock, especially that of Newcastle Disease. It?s a major concern. I think it?s worldwide. Senghore	So The Gambia is no exception when it comes to Newcastle Disease? Touray	The Gambia is of no exception, especially now {{if you go to the}} rural areas Newcastle is everywhere. So this is a concern. Senghore	Now at what period does Newcastle Disease affect chickens; does it come up regularly or is it always around? Touray	Yes formerly it normally happens during the Harmattan but now the disease is persistent, it has no time. Senghore	It used to be around November, December? Touray	Yes sometimes around October, November, December but now it?s all year round. Senghore	Could you tell me now if that?s the case what are the strategies that your department has in place to tackle major diseases like Newcastle for example? Touray	Well the department is doing vaccination programmes. Every three months we are vaccinating against Newcastle and other domestic diseases. But the problem is I think there are certain gaps that are lacking especially at the farmers? level because to dispose of the dead carcasses from the disease is also a concern. So farmers will be sensitised, how to go about the disease when there is an outbreak. Proper disposal of dead carcasses, disinfecting the environment and so on will at least reduce the risk of disease. Senghore	Now what are the kind of drugs that you have in stock, or the kinds of drugs that farmers demand from you? Touray	Now we have all these vaccines that are concerned. We have the NCD vaccines in various doses. Senghore	NCD means Newcastle Disease? Touray	Newcastle Disease. We have five hundred doses, we have one thousand doses and then farmers are buying it. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> <b>is</b> the process of dilution also is a problem because some farmers who don?t know how many litres to put for one vial [of vaccine] but technically we have our staff at the field level who are administering effectively. But for the disposal of these dead carcasses, it is a concern. Senghore	What about right here in your own experimental station? What is the effectiveness of the drugs that you use? Can you say your pilot can be a model for farmers to adopt? Touray	Exactly yes. My pilot, well farmers are adopting it because in here every dose of vaccine is calculated accordingly and then it is also formulated. When I say formulated it is mixed according to the number of litres. Because always it is important to calculate the number of birds, times the age, divided by the dose. It is very important. Always give the vaccine according to age. If that is done then you have no problem. So in here in Abuko we have tap water but for the Newcastle Vaccine always you have to use well water. We have to go to the well and get well water because we need water that you know has no chlorine because the chlorine might affect the organism itself and then we would have ended the vaccine, not even potential. Senghore	So you mean none of your birds die of Newcastle Disease here? Touray	No, none of our birds die of Newcastle because the place is well controlled. Before you enter the door you have to disinfect and then much more, the equipment that we are using. The environment is well sterilised. Senghore	What about other diseases, do they affect your birds here? Touray	Yes sometimes, well it?s difficult to say that there is no, we don?t have any other diseases, it?s very very difficult. But what I am emphasising on is that you have to disinfect. Always try to disinfect all your materials. You have to make strict control of the entry and exit. Senghore	Now what do you think other African countries can learn from our experience in poultry disease control? Touray	Well what other people can benefit from our experience is the simple method, whereby farmers now, they can vaccinate their own birds because they have been trained here, they learn a lot of practices. Now even farmers have gone beyond, that they are even ordering their own stock, their own day old chicks. They manage their own flocks through the training that they have gained from this department. So I can see that now the technology has been effectively transferred even in terms of disease control, farmers are doing it on their own. End of track.

40|$|The Buddhist {{thought of}} Seng-chao is {{basically}} {{inherited from the}} teaching and translation works of Kumārajīva whose works are mainly on the Prajñā-sūtras and the Mādhyamika School. This thesis reviews the important doctrines of the Prajñā-sūtras and the Mādhyamika firstly, and then carefully elaborates the most important essays of Seng-chao, namely, "Prajñā is not knowledge", "The emptiness of the unreal" and "The immutability of things". We can see the thought of Seng-chao is consistently linked up with the Prajñā-sūtra and the Mādhyamika School. The concept of emptiness of the Prajñā-sūtras {{is characterized by the}} doctrine that the phenomenal world and the ultimate reality are mutually inclusive. It does not deny the phenomenal world, but emphasizes that the phenomenal world in the eye of a normal person should not be simply treated as real. The Mādhyamika elaborates the concept of emptiness as not existence and not non-existence. Emptiness is regarded as the general nature of phenomenal world, The phenomenal world is not existence {{in the sense that it}} is not the reality. The phenomenal world is not non-existence in the sense that it is not nothing. Seng-chao inherited the concept of emptiness of the Prajñā-sūtra and the Mādhyamika School and further elaborated it. In his "Prajñā is not knowledge", he claims that "In the mind of sage, there is no cognized and therefore there is no uncognized. " In "The emptiness of the unreal", Seng-chao uses 'unreal' to elaborate emptiness. "Unreal' excludes the view that things are real, and also excludes the view that things do not exist at all, because 'unreal' still represents a certain state of existence. By virtue of this two-fold exclusion, it gives rise to another way of understanding of existence, i. e. dependent origination (pratītyasamutpāda) which is what the concept of emptiness denotes. In "The immutability of things", he states that "there is no dharma (thing) that goes and comes. " Things exist momentarily and do not station in the stream of time. So things do not alter their positions in the temporal order. In the final section, based on the above understanding of Seng-chao's concept of emptiness, the author tries to give an answer to the question concerning the position of "The immutability of things". This essay of Seng-chao was criticized for holding a Hinayana (Small Vehicle) position. It was found that the argument of the criticizer was based on misunderstanding of Seng-chao's concept of Ch'ien. By clarifying the concept of Ch'ien and other related concepts, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> can be dissolved...|$|R
40|$|Dear Sir or Madam: I am {{a scholar}} of macroeconomics, and now {{studying}} {{at the school of}} economics of Peking University in PRC. Although there is much to do to develop the education, academicians and students are active thinkers and raised many interesting questions. I followed some of the issue and proposed my own idea. As for the monetary transmission mechanism, many theories do not tell us the route from one static equilibrium point to another. Some academicians argue that the mechanism is like camera bellows, and we cannot and need not know the process. But we should at least prove that the economy is able to transmit from one point to another [...] The cobweb model in microeconomics shows that although the equilibrium point is determined by the intersection of the supply curve and demand curve. However, after a shock to the supply, the economy will not always result in a convergent point, and even bounds larger and larger round the equilibrium. Statistics shows that although the economy sometimes fluctuates sharply around the equilibrium, it will generally become stable, and such cases as the out-of -equilibrium never exist for long. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>problem</b> partly lies in the assumption. The model implies that everyone must behave rigidly. In fact, individuals are unpredictable, and a mathematical model cannot simplify their behavioral. Moreover, some academicians made similar misleading deduction of the monetary transmission mechanism. Deduction 1 shows their theory. <b>I</b> personally <b>think</b> that although <b>the</b> multiplier theory is a wonderful tool to help us explain the change of economy, it also set our students` minds in a rigid way of thinking. I developed an alternative deduction, and designed a computer program, which may demonstrate the whole transmission process and strengthen my argument. I hope my argument can give our students a new idea, though it does not fully resolve <b>the</b> <b>problem.</b> During my study, I consulted several macroeconomists. Ben S. Bernanke, the Howard Harrison and Gabrielle Snyder Beck Professor of Economics and Public Affairs at Princeton University, whom I contacted several times, gave me many valuable suggestions on the flaws of my article. Michael Parkin, professor of the University of Western Ontario, also gave me some terrific ideas. Professor N. Gregory Mankiw, University of Harvard, said that my article involved an issue of out-of-equilibrium IS-LM model, which was far from fully resolved in the economic field. I am really grateful to their help. I hope my article will be published soon so that we can discuss the unresolved issue openly, and call on the students of macroeconomics {{from all over the world}} to participate in the debate. Whether you publish it or nor, please notify me soon after a decision is made Address: building 38, Room 409, Peking University, Beijing, PRC. Monetary transmission mechanism,multiplier...|$|R
