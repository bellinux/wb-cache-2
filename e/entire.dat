5|$|Aircraft deicing {{vehicles}} {{have also}} improved since the accident, usually {{consisting of a}} large tanker truck, containing the concentrated de-icing fluid, with a water feed to dilute the fluid according to the ambient temperature. The vehicle also normally has a cherry picker crane, allowing the operator to spray the <b>entire</b> aircraft in as little time as possible; an <b>entire</b> Boeing 737 can be treated in under 10 minutes by a single de-icing vehicle. Airport runways are also deiced by sprayers fitted with long spraying arms. These arms are wide enough to cross the <b>entire</b> runway, and allow de-icing of the <b>entire</b> airstrip {{to take place in}} a single pass, reducing the length of time that the runway is unavailable.|$|E

5|$|An old style mercury {{barometer}} {{consists of a}} vertical glass tube about 1cm in diameter partially filled with mercury, and with a vacuum (called Torricelli's vacuum) in the unfilled volume (see diagram to the right). Notice that the mercury level {{at the center of}} the tube is higher than at the edges, making the upper surface of the mercury dome-shaped. The center of mass of the <b>entire</b> column of mercury would be slightly lower if the top surface of the mercury were flat over the <b>entire</b> cross-section of the tube. But the dome-shaped top gives slightly less surface area to the <b>entire</b> mass of mercury. Again the two effects combine to minimize the total potential energy. Such a surface shape is known as a convex meniscus.|$|E

5|$|At {{the age of}} five, Giridhar {{memorised}} the <b>entire</b> Bhagavad Gita, {{consisting of}} around 700verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 15days, {{with the help of}} his neighbour, Pandit Murlidhar Mishra. On Janmashtami day in 1955, he recited the <b>entire</b> Bhagavad Gita. He released the first Braille version of the scripture, with the original Sanskrit text and a Hindi commentary, at New Delhi on 30 November 2007, 52years after memorising the Gita. When Giridhar was seven, he memorised the <b>entire</b> Ramcharitmanas of Tulsidas, consisting of around 10,900verses with chapter and verse numbers, in 60days, assisted by his grandfather. On Rama Navami day in 1957, he recited the <b>entire</b> epic while fasting. Later, Giridhar went on to memorise the Vedas, the Upanishads, works of Sanskrit grammar, the Bhagavata Purana, all the works of Tulsidas, and many other works in Sanskrit and Indian literature.|$|E

Warren demanded an immediate halt to the <b>entire</b> cleanup operation. He was especially concerned about plutonium, which was undetectable on site.|$|E

5|$|Digging deeper {{is usually}} done for finding magma, which as a fuel source, removes the player's {{dependence}} on coal or wood. Another reason to dig deeper is for searching for specific raw materials, ores or gems. Magma pools or even bigger magma seas are found while digging into warm rock. Near magma seas, raw adamantine strata can be found. They are shaped like columns, which pass {{down through the}} <b>entire</b> magma sea. These columns are hollow and can be broken, revealing an <b>entire</b> shaft leading deeper into the underworld or hell. Underworld creatures are countless and can bring <b>entire</b> fortresses to ruin.|$|E
