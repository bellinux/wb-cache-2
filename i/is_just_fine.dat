2500|$|Using the Tralfamadorian {{passivity}} of fate, Billy Pilgrim {{learns to}} overlook {{death and the}} shock involved with death. Pilgrim claims the Tralfamadorian philosophy on death to be his most important lesson:The most important thing I learned on Tralfamadore was that when a person dies he only appears to die. He {{is still very much}} alive in the past, so it is very silly for people to cry at his funeral. All moments, past, present, and future, always have existed, always will exist. [...] When a Tralfamadorian sees a corpse, all he thinks is that the dead person is in bad condition in that particular moment, but that the same person <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>fine</b> in plenty of other moments. Now, when I myself hear that somebody is dead, I simply shrug and say what the Tralfamadorians say about dead people, which is [...] "So it goes."Billy Pilgrim continues throughout the novel to use the term [...] "so it goes" [...] as it relates to death. The ideas behind death, fate, time, and free will are drastically different when compared to those of Christianity.|$|E
