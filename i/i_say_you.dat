500|$|Although Parliamentary leaders, Vane among them, {{had promised}} Cromwell on 19 April 1653 to delay {{action on the}} {{election}} bill, Vane was likely one of the ringleaders that sought to have the bill enacted the next day before Cromwell could react. [...] Cromwell was however alerted by a supporter, and interrupted the proceedings that would otherwise have passed the bill. [...] Bringing troops into the chamber, he {{put an end to}} the debate, saying [...] "You are no Parliament. [...] <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are no Parliament. [...] I will put an end to your sitting." [...] Vane protested, [...] "This is not honest; yea, it is against morality and common honesty", to which Cromwell shouted in response, [...] "O Sir Henry Vane, Sir Henry Vane; the Lord deliver me from Sir Henry Vane!" [...] This ended the commonwealth, and Cromwell began to rule as Lord Protector. [...] Vane, [...] "daily missed and courted for his assistance", was invited to sit on Cromwell's council, but refused.|$|E
2500|$|From {{the middle}} of 1649 until 1651 Cromwell was away on campaign. In the meantime, with the king gone (and with him their common cause), the various factions in Parliament began to engage in infighting. On his return, Cromwell tried to galvanise the Rump into setting dates for new elections, uniting the three kingdoms under one polity, and {{to put in place}} a broad-brush, {{tolerant}} national church. However, the Rump vacillated in setting election dates, and although it put in place a basic liberty of conscience, it failed to produce an alternative for tithes or dismantle other aspects of the existing religious settlement. In frustration, in April 1653 Cromwell demanded that the Rump establish a caretaker government of 40 members (drawn both from the Rump and the army) and then abdicate. However, the Rump returned to debating its own bill for a new government. Cromwell was so angered by this that on 20 April 1653, supported by about forty musketeers, he cleared the chamber and dissolved the Parliament by force. Several accounts exist of this incident: in one, Cromwell is supposed to have said [...] "you are no Parliament, <b>I</b> <b>say</b> <b>you</b> are no Parliament; I will put an end to your sitting". At least two accounts agree that Cromwell snatched up the mace, symbol of Parliament's power, and demanded that the [...] "bauble" [...] be taken away. Cromwell's troops were commanded by Charles Worsley, later one of his Major Generals and one of his most trusted advisors, to whom he entrusted the mace.|$|E
