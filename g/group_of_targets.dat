40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a novel {{technique}} for the efficient prediction <b>of</b> multiple continuous <b>target</b> variables from high-dimensional and heterogeneous data sets using a hierarchical clustering approach. The proposed approach {{consists of three}} phases applied recursively: partitioning, localization and prediction. In the partitioning step, similar target variables are grouped together by a clustering algorithm. In the localization step, a classification model is used to predict which <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>target</b> variables is <b>of</b> particular interest. If the identified <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>target</b> variables still contains a large number <b>of</b> <b>target</b> variables, the partitioning and localization steps are repeated recursively and the identified group is further split into subgroups with more similar target variables. When the number <b>of</b> <b>target</b> variables per identified subgroup is sufficiently small, the third step predicts target variables using localized prediction models built from only those data records that correspond to the particular subgroup. Experiments performed {{on the problem of}} damage prediction in complex mechanical structures indicate that our proposed hierarchical approach is computationally more efficient and more accurate than straightforward methods <b>of</b> predicting each <b>target</b> variable individually or simultaneously using global prediction models. 1...|$|R

5000|$|BrahMos {{was first}} test-fired on 12 June 2001 from the Integrated Test Range (ITR), Chandipur in a {{vertical}} launch configuration. On 14 June 2004, another test {{was conducted at}} ITR and BrahMos was fired from a mobile launcher. On 5 March 2008, the land attack version of the missile was fired from the destroyer [...] and the missile hit and destroyed the right target among a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets.</b> The vertical launch of BrahMos was conducted on 18 December 2008 from INS Ranvir. The BrahMos I Block-I for the army was successfully tested with new capabilities in the deserts of Rajasthan, at a test range near Pokharan in December 2004 and March 2007.During a user trial on 20 January 2009, BrahMos was tested with a new navigation system but it failed to hit the target. BrahMos Aerospace Corporation's director Dr Sivathanu Pillai said, [...] "The missile performance was absolutely normal until the last phase, but the missile missed the target, though it maintained the direction." [...] and that [...] "The problem was in the software, not hardware". The Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO) {{said that there were}} [...] "small hitches" [...] in the last stage of the test firing due to delay in input of satellite navigation input to the Inertial Navigation System, the missile traveled for 112 seconds instead of the slated 84 seconds and fell 7 km away from the target. According to BrahMos Corporation, another test of the new missile was to be conducted within one month, but it was eventually conducted on 4 March 2009 and was deemed successful. BrahMos was test-fired again on 29 March 2009. For the test, the missile had to identify a building among a cluster of buildings in an urban environment. BrahMos successfully hit the intended target in two and a half minutes of launch. According to official sources, [...] "The new seeker is unique and would help us to hit our targets, which are insignificant in terms of size, in a cluster of large buildings. India is now the only nation in the world with this advanced technology" [...] After the third test, Lt Gen Noble Thamburaj, said that the Indian Army wanted the BrahMos to achieve high standards of accuracy and congratulated the scientists on behalf of the Indian Army. The Indian Army confirmed that the test was extremely successful and the army is absolutely satisfied with the missile. This marking the completion of the development phase of BrahMos Block-II, and it was ready for induction.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a coordinated standoff tracking methodology of groups of moving targets using multiple UAVs. The vector field guidance approach is first applied to track a <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> {{for a single}} UAV by defining a variable standoff orbit to be followed, which can keep all targets within the field-of view of the UAV. A new feedforward term {{is included in the}} guidance command considering variable standoff distance, and the convergence of the vector field to the standoff orbit is analysed and enhanced by adjusting radial velocity using two active measures associated with vector field generation. Moreover, for multiple group tracking by multiple UAVs, a two-phase approach is proposed as a suboptimal solution for an NP-hard problem, consisting of target clustering/assignment and cooperative standoff group tracking with online local replanning. Lastly, localisation sensitivity to the <b>group</b> <b>of</b> <b>targets</b> is investigated for different angular separations between UAVs and sensing configurations. Numerical simulations are performed using randomly moving ground vehicles with four UAVs to verify the feasibility and benefit of the proposed approach. © 2013 IEEE...|$|E
