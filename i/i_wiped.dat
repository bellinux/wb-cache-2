25|$|Walter {{embraced the}} idea of making their {{fortunes}} in the New World. With him as their musical director, impresario, and chaperone, the three older sisters – including Rosalind, then – arrived in New York at Christmas 1911, with enough money for three weeks in a hotel. They would have to make enough money by singing to pay for their return ticket. They were an instant success; within six months they were invited to sing at the White House, but left for home before they could fit the President into their busy schedule. At this point, the eldest sister (who had studied the harp and singing at the Royal College of Music) got married and was replaced by the youngest. As The Fuller Sisters they continued making immensely successful tours, with Rosalind their most bewitching performer. President Woodrow Wilson invited them to sing for him on two occasions, once at the White House and once at his summer residence. Their career ended when the entry of the US into World War <b>I</b> <b>wiped</b> out the demand for folksongs.|$|E
500|$|In 1921 {{the couple}} went to Europe where Tunis freelanced {{as a sports}} writer for American {{publications}} and played in some tennis tournaments on the Riviera, including a match against King Gustaf V of Sweden, who was 70 at the time. Tunis also played a doubles match against the French women's champion Suzanne Lenglen. Returning to the U.S. {{at the end of}} the summer, he dropped in on former Harvard classmate Lawrence Winship, the Sunday editor of The Boston Globe. When Winship learned that Tunis actually knew the flamboyant Lenglen, he insisted he write an article about her for the Globe before leaving the building. The pressure of that deadline caused him such anxiety that after half an hour of struggle he went to the building's fire escape, [...] "leaned over the railing, and threw up. I'll never forget it. <b>I</b> <b>wiped</b> my face with copy paper. But I did the story." [...] Between 1920 and 1940 Tunis freelanced for a number of major magazines, including Reader's Digest, Harper's, Atlantic Monthly, Collier's, The Saturday Evening Post and Esquire, writing primarily on two topics: sports and education. He also covered sports for the New York Evening Post from 1925 to 1932 and had a weekly column in The New Yorker. According to Norman Cousins in Writing for Love or Money, Tunis was known for producing [...] "fact-packed articles based upon research". Working six days a week and taking the seventh to play tennis, Tunis published over 2,000 articles and short stories, becoming one ofAmerica's premier sportswriters.|$|E

60|$|I {{went to my}} mother. Presently {{she raised}} herself {{from the ground and}} sat up with her hands over her face. The blood from the wound the stick had made ran down her face on to her breast, and <b>I</b> <b>wiped</b> it away with grass. She sat for a long while thus, while the child cried, the cow lowed to be milked, and <b>I</b> <b>wiped</b> up the blood with the grass. At last she took her hands away and spoke to me.|$|E
