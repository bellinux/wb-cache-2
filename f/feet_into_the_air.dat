Water brakes {{can only be}} used when a splashdown element, in which {{a body of water}} surrounds a section of track, is present within the layout of the roller coaster. When scoops on the last car of each train come in contact with the surrounding water, the train slows down and the water is sprayed several <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> behind it.|$|E
5|$|On May 24, {{the strikers}} seized the Strong mine on Battle Mountain, which {{overlooked}} {{the town of}} Victor. The next day, at about 9am, 125 deputies arrived in Altman and set up camp {{at the base of}} Bull Hill. As they started to march toward the strikers' camp, miners at the Strong mine blew up the shafthouse, hurling the structure more than 300 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> A few moments later, the steam boiler was also dynamited, showering the deputies with timber, iron and cable. The deputies fled to the rail station and left town.|$|E
5|$|Danner's {{physical}} strength extends to his legs, {{allowing him to}} leap great heights and distances. At age 10 he can leap 40 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and run faster than a train. During his freshman year in college, he easily breaks a world track record, though he actually doesn't run at his full speed. While {{in the service of}} the French Foreign Legion in World War I, he traverses thirty-seven miles round trip in just thirty minutes (a speed of about 148mph); all while carrying 2,000 pounds of food, water, and ammunition for his unit. Despite his great strength, he is still susceptible to fatigue.|$|E

25|$|The Old Courthouse {{interior}} {{is composed of}} quadrants which are set apart by broad hallways which meet at the building's center. There they form a large, open three story rotunda. The rotunda is the dominating feature of the interior. It rises over 100 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> {{and at the top}} features an allegorical painting representing peace and prosperity. The halls have mosaic floors and wall treatment composed of white marble dado which is capped with antique verde serpentine stone. Marbleized plaster, scagliola, panels complete the walls. The building's ceilings are decorated with plaster cornices and molded leaf and rosette compliments. The Honduras mahogany doors have a rail and panel design and beveled glass is used for decorative side lights and panels.|$|E
25|$|Knievel and his daredevils debuted on January 3, 1966, at the National Date Festival in Indio, California. The {{show was}} a huge success. Knievel {{received}} several offers to host the show after their first performance. The second booking was in Hemet, California, but was canceled due to rain. The next performance was on February 10, in Barstow, California. During the performance, Knievel attempted a new stunt {{in which he would}} jump, spread-eagled, over a speeding motorcycle. Knievel jumped too late and the motorcycle hit him in the groin, tossing him fifteen <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> He was hospitalized {{as a result of his}} injuries. When released, he returned to Barstow to finish the performance he had started almost a month earlier.|$|E

5000|$|Nearly all {{variations}} on the dance are based upon the simple cinq pas (five step) tourdion. The cinq pas begins in either a posture droit or posture gauche (the former with the right foot slightly in front, the latter with the left), with weight evenly distributed between the feet. Assuming a posture gauche, a pied en l'air droit and a petit saut follow in one beat, that is, a small kick of <b>the</b> right <b>foot</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> at <b>the</b> same time as a slight hop as to land with the left foot. (It should be remembered that all pieds en l'air are accompanied by the petit saut of the opposite foot.) ...|$|R

2500|$|Around 17:00 on 12 August 1945, 360 miles {{south-east}} of Okinawa, while I-58 {{was running}} northwards {{on the surface}} at 12 knots, her Type 3 radar detected multiple targets. Soon after ships were sighted on the horizon. The submarine dived, and at 17:16, the crew sighted what they {{believed to be a}} seaplane carrier escorted by a destroyer. In reality, the [...] "seaplane carrier" [...] was the dock landing ship , escorted by the [...] en route from Okinawa to Leyte. At 18:26, Oak Hill sighted a periscope, and the Nickel attacked at flank speed. The Nickel fired depth charges, and attempted to ram, sustaining minor damage to her hull. A Kaiten broke surface astern of Oak Hill and exploded. Half an hour later the Nickel sighted another periscope astern of Oak Hill, and fired depth charges. An explosion followed, throwing a black geyser of oil and water 50 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> An oil slick was also sighted.|$|E

2500|$|The next {{engagement}} {{occurred on}} May 13, 1943, when [...] sank Mambi. Mambi was with Convoy NC-18, sailing six miles off Manati, {{when she was}} hit by a single torpedo, sinking her quickly. Twenty-three men were killed, including five American United States Navy Armed Guards, who manned the ship's weapons. Eleven others survived, including the ship's master and one of the armed guards. The 2,249 ton American ship SS Nickeliner was also sunk during the same attack, after being struck by two torpedoes. The first torpedo explosion lifted the ship's bow {{out of the water and}} threw up a column of water and flames about 100 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> The second damaged the tanks of ammonia water the ship was carrying. Miraculously, the crew, which included seven armed guards, escaped into lifeboats without a single loss of life. They were rescued by a Cuban submarine chaser as Nickeliner sank, and landed at Nuevitas.|$|E
2500|$|The 2006 event drew 58,000 spectators. On {{the last}} day after the show ended, Sunday, July 16, 2006, a Hawker Hunter jet (N58MX) flown by pilot Robert [...] "Bob" [...] Guilford, crashed after takeoff. After the plane was airborne, Guilford climbed about 1500 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> and made a right turn. He came back around towards the Hillsboro Airport, and after his turn and passed by the airport losing {{altitude}} and speed quickly. Soon after, the Mk.58 Hunter stalled and impacted {{the ground in a}} fireball. Four houses were damaged and the pilot died on impact, but there were no casualties on the ground. After the crash, the rest of the air show was canceled. The jet had been on static display at the show, and was not an aerial performer. The pilot had taken off to return to his home in California {{near the end of the}} show when the crash occurred.|$|E
2500|$|On {{the morning}} of 9 August, 260 miles {{north-east}} of Aparri, Luzon, I-58 sighted a zigzagging [...] "convoy of ten transports" [...] escorted by three destroyers, and Kaiten No.'s 4 and 5 were launched. In fact the [...] "convoy" [...] was the hunter-killer team Task Group 75.19 led by the escort carrier , carrying out anti-submarine sweeps between Leyte and Okinawa. The destroyer escort [...] sighted and attacked Kaiten No.5 [...] with her guns, and then attacked Kaiten No.4 with depth charges. Kaiten No.5 was sunk by fire from her 5-inch stern gun. Kaiten No.4 sighted again over an hour later and again attacked with depth charges {{which resulted in a}} violent explosion, throwing water 30 <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air.</b> I-58 came to periscope depth after her hydrophones reported a distant explosion. In Hashimoto's opinion, the previously sighted destroyer had disappeared. He headed northwards to evade pursuit. The crew of Johnnie Hutchins were later awarded the Navy Unit Commendation.|$|E

2500|$|Through the maquis {{caused the}} Germans much difficulty, the guerrillas tended not to fare well in {{sustained}} combat. The SOE agent André Hue who was leading a maquis band in Brittany later recalled about the Battle of Saint Marcel as the firefight on 18 June 1944 at a farmhouse outside Saint Marcel {{he was using}} as his base: [...] "Now every weapon that the enemy possessed was {{brought to bear on}} our front line in a cacophony of shots and explosions which could not drown an even more sinister noise: the occasional crack of a single bullet. A man within feet of me slumped to the ground with blood spurting two <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> from the side of his neck [...] [...] [...] We had anticipated an infantry assault-possibly backed up with light armour-but snipers, a threat we had not met before, were difficult to counter. Within minutes of the first casualty, another seven of our men lay dying within the farm complex: all had been shot from long range." [...] As the snipers continued to cut down his men while he could hear the sound of panzers coming up in the distance, Hue ordered his men to retreat into the woods under the cover of darkness while using his radio to call in a RAF airstrike that disorganised the Germans enough to make escape possible. Summarizing up the Battle of Saint Marcel, Hue wrote: [...] "The majority of the younger men had never been in battle, and seeing their friends' brains and guts oozing on to the grass and mud made them sick in the head and stomach. Just as terrifying to the young Frenchmen was the sight of those who were wounded and who yet had to die without help. I was not surprised that so many had enough. I was perhaps astonished that the number of defectors were so low".|$|E

The two steps are then repeated, with care that the kicks are small (as the dance is brisk). Following the four kicks, one performs a saut moyen—a small jump <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>air</b> that pulls <b>the</b> <b>feet</b> <b>into</b> <b>the</b> posture gauche or droit—whichever {{is the opposite of}} the first.
