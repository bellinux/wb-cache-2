5|$|Portsmouth, as {{the most}} densely {{populated}} city in the United Kingdom, is the only city whose population density exceeds that of London. As of the 2011 census, the city had 205,400 residents. This equates to 5,100 people living in every square kilometre (0.4 sq.mi.), which is eleven {{times more than the}} regional average of 440 people per square kilometre and more than London, which has 4,900 people per square kilometre. The city used to be even more densely populated, with the 1951 census showing a population of 233,545. In a reversal of that decrease, the population of the city <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>gradually</b> <b>increasing</b> since the 1990s. With about 860,000 residents, the South Hampshire built-up area is the fifth-largest urban area in England and the largest in South East England, forming the centre of one of the United Kingdom's most populous metropolitan areas.|$|E

2500|$|Since the 1850s, a large {{proportion}} of the world's grasslands have been tilled and converted to croplands, allowing the rapid oxidation of large quantities of soil organic carbon. [...] However, in the United States in 2004 (the most recent year for which EPA statistics are available), agricultural soils including pasture land sequestered 0.8% (46 teragrams) as much carbon as was released in the United States by the combustion of fossil fuels (5988 teragrams).

2500|$|The Garnkirk and Glasgow Railway {{opened in}} 1831 and linking with other railways, {{it was the}} first railway that {{directly}} competed with the canal. Fearing disaster from this competition, [...] "the company reduced their dues to about one-third of the rate which had been charged up till that time".

60|$|It {{very rarely}} happens that the nominal price of labour universally falls, but we well {{know that it}} {{frequently}} remains the same, while the nominal price of provisions <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>gradually</b> <b>increasing.</b> This is, in effect, a real fall {{in the price of}} labour, and during this period the condition of the lower orders of the community must gradually grow worse and worse. But the farmers and capitalists are growing rich from the real cheapness of labour. Their increased capitals enable them to employ a greater number of men. Work therefore may be plentiful, and the price of labour would consequently rise. But the want of freedom in the market of labour, which occurs more or less in all communities, either from parish laws, or the more general cause of the facility of combination among the rich, and its difficulty among the poor, operates to prevent the price of labour from rising at the natural period, and keeps it down some time longer; perhaps till a year of scarcity, when the clamour is too loud and the necessity too apparent to be resisted.|$|E
50|$|The lack of {{correlation}} between results obtained from traditional salt spray testing and the ‘real world’ atmospheric corrosion of vehicles, left {{the automotive industry}} without a reliable test method for predicting the service life expectancy of their products.
