5|$|After {{the failure}} and <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Hospitallers, {{the history of}} the region is {{shrouded}} in obscurity for decades. But the trend toward the unification of the Romanian polities seems to begin with Voivode Litovoi. He (or his namesake son) was at war with the Hungarians and killed in battle sometime between 1270 and 1280. In the battle, his brother, Bărbat was captured. Bărbat was forced not only to pay ransom but also to recognize Hungarian rule.|$|E

5|$|Glacier retreat {{results in}} the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher {{elevations}} are cooler, the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of {{a significant portion of the}} accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.|$|E
2500|$|<b>The</b> {{practical}} concerns <b>of</b> <b>the</b> ancient Greeks {{to establish}} a calendar is first exemplified by the Works and Days <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek poet Hesiod, who lived around 700 BC.

[...] Around 450 BC we begin to see compilations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> seasonal appearances and <b>disappearances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> stars in texts known as parapegmata, which were used to regulate <b>the</b> civil calendars <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Greek city-states on <b>the</b> basis <b>of</b> astronomical observations.|$|R

5|$|Many of {{the special}} effects in A Trip to the Moon, as in {{numerous}} other Méliès films, were created using the substitution splice technique, in which the camera operator stopped filming long enough for something onscreen to be altered, added, or taken away. Méliès carefully spliced the resulting shots together to create apparently magical effects, such as {{the transformation of the}} astronomers' telescopes into stools or the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> exploding Selenites in puffs of smoke. Other effects were created using theatrical means, such as stage machinery and pyrotechnics. The film also features transitional dissolves.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} surviving {{church in}} Bristol is St James' Priory in Horsefair, Whitson Street. It {{was founded in}} 1129, as a Benedictine priory, by Robert Rufus. The 12th century also saw the founding of All Saints and St Philip and Jacob churches. Temple Church, now in ruins, {{was built on the}} site of the oval church of the Knights Templar, a Christian military order forcibly disbanded in 1312. Either just before or just after the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Templars, the church was rebuilt on a rectangular plan and served as a parish church.|$|E
5|$|The rapid <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Rodrigues rail {{may have}} been caused by {{introduced}} cats, but {{it is also possible that}} deforestation by tortoise hunters may have contributed significantly; from 1735, these hunters burned off forests so they could collect giant Cylindraspis tortoises for their meat and oil. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré, who visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, wrote in 1763 that the bird was extinct by the time of his visit.|$|E
5|$|This {{record of}} disputed {{succession}} {{was by no}} means unique to Northumbria, and the kingdoms of Mercia and Wessex experienced similar troubles during the eighth and ninth centuries. In Wessex, from the death of Centwine in 685 to Egbert's seizure of power in 802, the relationships between successive kings are far from clear and few kings are known to have been close kinsmen of their predecessors or successors. The same may be true of Mercia from the death of Ceolred in 716 until the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Mercian kingdom in the late ninth century.|$|E
30|$|Psoas muscle {{spasticity}} is hypothesised as a rare {{cause of}} {{low back pain}} in patients with infantile cerebral palsy. The authors describe a new manoeuvre for <b>the</b> study <b>of</b> psoas tenderness and ultrasound (US)-guided transabdominal botulinum toxin injection technique. A possible causal relationship between psoas tension and low back pain was found incidentally in two examined cases. In subsequent patients, botulinum toxin was injected and, in cases <b>of</b> <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> symptoms, <b>the</b> psoas tendon was sectioned at the pelvic brim with definitive <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> pain. <b>The</b> relationship between psoas tension and low back pain in patients with infantile cerebral palsy seems likely, given the result in the four patients.|$|R

5|$|Two plagues afflicted coastal New England in 1614 and 1617, {{possibly}} {{transmitted from}} British and French fishermen to natives {{on the shore}} (although no concrete evidence exists to prove such a connection). The plague killed between 90% and 95% of the local Wampanoag inhabitants. The near <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> tribe from the site left their cornfields and cleared areas vacant for the Pilgrims to occupy; it also meant that the Native Americans were in no condition to resist {{the arrival of the}} colonists.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model of}} the {{evolution}} of this genus, also proposed by Casier in 1960, is that the direct ancestor of the Carcharocles is the shark Otodus obliquus, which lived from 60 mya to 13 mya during the Paleocene and Miocene epochs. In this model, O. obliquus evolved into O. aksuaticus, which evolved into C. auriculatus, and then into C. angustidens, and then into C. chubutensis, and then finally into C. megalodon. The evolution of this lineage is characterized by the increase of serrations, the widening of the crown, the development of a more triangular shape, and the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lateral cusps. The genus Otodus is ultimately derived from Cretolamna, a shark from the Cretaceous period.|$|E
5|$|Banksia ericifolia {{depends on}} fire for regeneration; if fires are too infrequent, populations age and {{eventually}} die out. However, too-frequent fires also threaten this species, which takes around {{six years to}} reach maturity and flower. One study estimated an optimum fire interval of 15–30years. For {{a large part of}} its distribution Banksia ericifolia grows near areas of human habitation on Australia's eastern coastline. Bushland near urban areas is subject to both arson and prescribed burns, drastically reducing fire intervals and resulting in the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> species from some areas. The hotter a fire the more quickly seed is released; timing of rains afterwards is also critical for seedling survival.|$|E
50|$|Although {{the older}} Slavic-Iranian tribes were enveloped by the {{widespread}} Turkic Empires <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Pontic-Caspian steppe, the following centuries saw a complete <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> both <b>the</b> Iranian and Turkic languages, indicating dominance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Slavic language among the common people.|$|R
30|$|A {{system is}} said to be elastic when it goes back to its steady state after <b>the</b> <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> stress. <b>The</b> stress can be of {{compression}} or expansion type and its effect is stored in internal energy “potential” form.|$|R
500|$|Anthropogenic {{climate change}} has likely exerted a major effect on {{amphibian}} declines. [...] For example, in the Monteverde Cloud Forest, {{a series of}} unusually warm years led to <b>the</b> mass <b>disappearances</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Monteverde Harlequin frog and the Golden Toad. [...] An increased level of cloud cover, a result of geoengineering and global warming, which has warmed the nights and cooled daytime temperatures, has been blamed for facilitating the growth and proliferation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fungus Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis (<b>the</b> causative agent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> fungal infection chytridiomycosis).|$|R
5|$|In {{contrast}} to the kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and Wessex, little reliable evidence about {{the kingdom of the}} East Angles has survived, because of the destruction of its monasteries and the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two East Anglian sees that occurred as the result of Viking raids and settlement. The main primary sources for information about Anna's life and reign are the Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum (Ecclesiastical History of the English People), completed in Northumbria by Bede in 731, and the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, initially written in the ninth century, which mentions Anna's death. The mediaeval work known as the Liber Eliensis, written in Ely in the twelfth century, is a source of information about Anna's daughters Æthelthryth and Seaxburh, and also describes Anna's death and burial.|$|E
5|$|Increased Sabbat {{activity}} {{coincides with}} the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> Malkavian chief, Alistair Grout. At Grout's mansion, the fledgling sees Nines leaving and discovers Grout's remains in the mansion with vampire hunter Grunfeld Bach, who denies involvement in Grout's death. Learning about Nines' presence at the mansion, LaCroix tells the other chiefs to approve Nines' execution. The fledgling {{is sent to the}} Museum of Natural History to recover the sarcophagus, but finds that it has been stolen. Jack later suggests to the fledgling that LaCroix wants the sarcophagus to drink the blood of the ancient within, gaining its power.|$|E
5|$|No East Anglian {{charters}} (and {{few other}} documents) have survived to modern times and those mediaeval chronicles that {{refer to the}} East Angles are treated with great caution by scholars. Very few records from the Kingdom of the East Angles have survived, because of the complete destruction of the kingdom's monasteries and the <b>disappearance</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> two East Anglian sees {{as the result of}} Viking raids and settlement. The principal documentary source for the early period of the kingdom's history is Ecclesiastical History of the English People, written by Bede in the eighth century. East Anglia is first mentioned as a distinct political unit in the Tribal Hidage, which is thought to have been compiled somewhere in England during the seventh century.|$|E
