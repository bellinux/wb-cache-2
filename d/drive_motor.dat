25|$|A {{driving licence}} in Poland (prawo jazdy) is a {{document}} {{issued by the}} relevant government agency, regional or local government, confirming {{the rights of the}} holder to <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles.|$|E
25|$|A class 3 {{or class}} 3A licence permits the holder to drive motorcars {{weighing}} less than 3,000kg when unladen and to carry {{no more than}} seven passengers. In addition, the holder may drive a motor tractor or other motor vehicles with an unladen weight of less than 2,500kg. A class 3A licence limits the holder to <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles without a clutch pedal, typically automatic transmission cars, whereas a class 3 licence allows the holder to drive all motor vehicles. Class 3A drivers {{are not allowed to}} drive manual transmission cars.|$|E
25|$|Zopiclone causes {{impaired}} driving skills {{similar to}} those of benzodiazepines. Long-term users of hypnotic drugs for sleep disorders develop only partial tolerance to adverse effects on driving with users of hypnotic drugs even after 1 year of use still showing an increased motor vehicle accident rate. Patients who <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles should not take zopiclone unless they stop driving due to a significant increased risk of accidents in zopiclone users. Zopiclone induces impairment of psychomotor function. Driving or operating machinery should be avoided after taking zopiclone as effects can carry over to the next day, including impaired hand eye coordination.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first attempt}} to apply TOPS to diesel {{multiple}} units saw each carriage within a unit being allocated its own unique class number. This was probably because most DMUs were not kept in permanent formations. Classes were allocated according to the following division: 100-131: <b>Driving</b> <b>Motor</b> cars 140-150: <b>Driving</b> Trailer cars 160-190: Trailer cars 201-203: DEMU <b>Driving</b> <b>Motor</b> cars 211-212: DEMU Driving Trailer cars 221-225: DEMU Trailer cars 251: Express DEMU <b>Driving</b> <b>Motor</b> cars 261: Express DEMU Trailer cars ...|$|R

Later, two of the trailers were rebuilt into Control Trailers.|$|R
25|$|In the 85D, {{the rear}} drive unit is {{replaced}} by a smaller one to save cost and weight, while the second motor of similar size is added to the front wheels. This results in an AWD car with comparable power and acceleration to the RWD version. Additionally, Tesla said the 85D has a 2% (5-mile) range increase and 11% increase in top speed over the 85. In the P85D, the high-power rear drive unit is retained, while a new front <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> boosts the total power by about 50%. This results in a significant increase in acceleration and top speed. Deliveries of the P85D started in December 2014, with the 85D models starting in February 2015, and the 70D models starting in April 2015.|$|E
25|$|The rising {{popularity}} of disco came {{in tandem with}} developments {{in the role of}} the DJ. DJing developed from the use of multiple record turntables and DJ mixers to create a continuous, seamless mix of songs, with one song transitioning to another with no break in the music to interrupt the dancing. The resulting DJ mix differed from previous forms of dance music in the 1960s, which were oriented towards live performances by musicians. This in turn affected the arrangement of dance music, since songs in the disco era typically contained beginnings and endings marked by a simple beat or riff that could be easily used to transition to a new song. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct <b>drive</b> <b>motor.</b> DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings. DJs helped to introduce rare records and new artists to club audiences.|$|E
25|$|Unexpected {{problems}} and failures have impacted the station's assembly time-line and work schedules leading to periods of reduced capabilities and, in some cases, could have forced {{abandonment of the}} station for safety reasons, had these problems not been resolved. During STS-120 in 2007, following the relocation of the P6 truss and solar arrays, it was noted during the redeployment of the array that it had become torn and was not deploying properly. An EVA {{was carried out by}} Scott Parazynski, assisted by Douglas Wheelock. The men took extra precautions {{to reduce the risk of}} electric shock, as the repairs were carried out with the solar array exposed to sunlight. The issues with the array were followed in the same year by problems with the starboard Solar Alpha Rotary Joint (SARJ), which rotates the arrays on the starboard side of the station. Excessive vibration and high-current spikes in the array <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> were noted, resulting in a decision to substantially curtail motion of the starboard SARJ until the cause was understood. Inspections during EVAs on STS-120 and STS-123 showed extensive contamination from metallic shavings and debris in the large drive gear and confirmed damage to the large metallic race ring at the heart of the joint, and so the joint was locked to prevent further damage. Repairs to the joint were carried out during STS-126 with lubrication of both joints and the replacement of 11 out of 12 trundle bearings on the joint.|$|E

It was stated that it took only 10 months for their turnover to rise to $1 million in annual recurring revenue following their official launch. They also attended the AutoVentures Conference in 2016, where <b>Drive</b> <b>Motors</b> was listed as a contestant for the main award and pitched their product as the future of the auto industry. <b>Drive</b> <b>Motors</b> was announced the winner following Aaron Krane's presentation.|$|R

[...] Compared to the , the Rega [...] has a thicker, heavier plinth; the <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> is mounted on the plinth using a rubber suspension for improved isolation. The glass platter is also thicker, as is the felt mat.|$|E
500|$|A second {{challenge}} {{was how to}} overcome {{the rotation of the}} suspended parts – the sub-chassis, platter, arm and cartridge – relative to the motor. This was done by re-imagining a suspension that had less freedom of lateral movement relative to the <b>drive</b> <b>motor.</b> The Xerxes uses a relatively light medium-density fibreboard (MDF) top board on which the bearing and tonearm assemblies are mounted. Firm rubber [...] "Blobs" [...] mounted on the bottom board (along with the motor assembly) support yet decouple from the top board. Aesthetically, the two boards are encased by a wooden surround fixed to the base board with screws. These design principles can be seen throughout the evolution of the Xerxes, right through to the Xerxes 20plus.|$|E
500|$|... {{women in}} Saudi Arabia have limited freedom of {{movement}} and in practice {{are not allowed to}} <b>drive</b> <b>motor</b> vehicles. In 1990, dozens of women in Riyadh drove their cars in protest, were imprisoned for one day, had their passports confiscated, and some of them lost their jobs. In September 2007, the Association for the Protection and Defense of Women's Rights in Saudi Arabia, co-founded by Wajeha al-Huwaider and Fawzia al-Uyyouni, gave a 1,100 signature petition to King Abdullah asking for women to be allowed to drive. On International Women's Day 2008, Huwaider filmed herself driving and received international media attention after the video was posted on YouTube. Inspired by the Arab Spring, a woman from Jeddah, Najla Hariri, started driving in the second week of May 2011, stating [...] "Before in Saudi, you never heard about protests. [...] after {{what has happened in the}} Middle East, we started to accept a group of people going outside and saying what they want in a loud voice, and this has had an impact on me." ...|$|E

2500|$|Traditionally, a DJ {{will use}} two {{turntables}} simultaneously and mix between the two. These {{are connected to}} a DJ mixer, an amplifier, speakers, and various electronic music equipment such as a microphone and effects units. The DJ mixes the two albums currently in rotation and/or does [...] "scratching" [...] by moving one of the record platters while manipulating the crossfader on the mixer. The result of mixing two records is a unique sound created by the seemingly combined sound of two separate songs into one song. Although there is considerable overlap between the two roles, a DJ {{is not the same}} as a record producer of a music track. The development of DJing was also influenced by new turntablism techniques, such as beatmatching, a process facilitated by the introduction of new turntable technologies such as the Technics SL-1200 MK 2, first sold in 1978, which had a precise variable pitch control and a direct <b>drive</b> <b>motor.</b> DJs were often avid record collectors, who would hunt through used record stores for obscure soul records and vintage funk recordings.

They were originally intended to have all-motored axles as in the 1992 Stock, so that they would have enough traction and acceleration for faster running times; however, it was later decided that 75% of motored axles would be sufficient, which reduced project costs by around £10 million (about 3.5% of the overall cost). They have mechanical-only Scharfenberg couplers.|$|R
