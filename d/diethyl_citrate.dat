40|$|<b>Diethyl</b> <b>citrate</b> (Et 2 Cit) {{is a new}} {{potential}} anticoagulant. The coordination {{dynamics and}} coordination mechanism of Et 2 Cit with Ca 2 + ions {{and the effect of}} pH on the complex were examined. The result was compared with that for the conventional anticoagulant sodium citrate (Na 3 Cit). The reaction order (n) of Et 2 Cit and Na 3 Cit with Ca 2 + was 2. 46 and 2. 44, respectively. The reaction rate constant (k) was 120 and 289 [*]L·mol− 1 ·s− 1. The reverse reaction rate constant (kre) was 0. 52 and 0. 15 [*]L·mol− 1 ·s− 1, respectively. It is indicated that the coordination ability of Et 2 Cit with Ca 2 + was weaker than that of Na 3 Cit. However, the dissociation rate of the calcium complex of Et 2 Cit was faster than that of Na 3 Cit. Increased pH accelerated the dissociation rate of the complex and improved its anticoagulant effect. The Et 2 Cit complex with calcium was synthesized and characterized by elemental analysis, XRD, FT-IR, 1 H NMR, and ICP. These characteristics indicated that O in –COOH and C–O–C of Et 2 Cit was coordinated with Ca 2 + in a bidentate manner with 1 [*]:[*] 1 coordination proportion; that is, complex CaEt 2 Cit was formed. Given that CaEt 2 Cit released Ca 2 + more easily than Na 3 Cit, a calcium solution was not needed in intravenous infusions using Et 2 Cit as anticoagulant unlike using Na 3 Cit. Consequently, hypocalcemia and hypercalcemia were avoided...|$|E

40|$|Lymphatic {{filariasis}} (LF) is {{a serious}} socioeconomic and public health problem in the world. As on De-cember 2006, the total population at risk for LF {{was estimated to be}} 1254 million in 83 endemic countries, of which 64 % contributed by Southeast Asia region alone. In India, it is estimated that 554. 2 million population are at risk of LF infection in 243 imple-mentation units (districts) 1. National Health Policy 2002 aims at elimination of transmission and the prevention of disability due to LF by the year 20152. In Andhra Pradesh (A. P.), sixteen districts are under mass drug administration (MDA) programme cover-ing 54 million population with annual single dose of <b>diethyl</b> carbamazine <b>citrate</b> (DEC) tablets orally 2.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The main aim of {{the study}} was to develop orodispersible tablets of <b>diethyl</b> carbamazine <b>citrate</b> (an anthelmintic) for {{improving}} patient compliance,especially those of paediatric & geriatric categories with difficulties in swallowing. In the wet granulation method mixture of sodium bicarbonate and tartaric acid along with agar were used as disintegrants. The tablet formulation containing 28 mg of agar, 26 mg of sodium bicarbonate and 26 mg of tartaric acid considered as the overall best formulation (with an in vitro dispersion time of approx. 54. 39 sec and in vitro drug release of 98. 4 %) Short term stability studies (at 40 ± 2 ºC/ 75 ± 5 % RH) on the best formulation indicated that there no significant changes in drug content. IR spectroscopic study indicated that there are no drug excipient interactions. The use of mixture of tartaric acid and sodium bicarbonate further assists in taste masking. Undoubtedly the availability of various technologies and the manifold advantages of orodispersible tablets will surely enhance the patient compliance providing rapid onset of action...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the study}} was to develop colon {{specific}} sustained release matrix tablets of <b>diethyl</b> carbamazine <b>citrate</b> (DEC), an anthelmintic for improving patient compliance, delivered to colon for its effective actions. The colon targeted matrix tablet was prepared by wet granulation technique using different percentage of guar gum as matrix carrier and coated with Eudragit L 100. Seven batches of matrix tablets were prepared with varying percentage of guar gum and hydroxyl propyl methyl cellulose (HPMC). The dissolution study of DEC matrix tablet in simulated colonic fluid (phosphate buffer pH 6. 8) was 96. 78 % at the end of 24 hr study. The best result of studies showed that colon targeted matrix tablet containing 48 % guar gum was most to provide targeting of DEC for local action in the colon. Short term stability studies (at 40 ± 2 ºC/ 75 ± 5 % RH for 3 months) on the best formulation indicated that there no significant changes in drug content. IR spectroscopic study indicated that there are no drug excipient interactions...|$|R
40|$|Filariasis and {{helminth}} {{infections are}} public health problems in Indonesia. Starting in 2005, the Ministry of Health launched filariasis elimination by implementing preventive mass drug administration (MDA) or “POPM”. At least as 65 % {{of the population}} in the district/city are given <b>diethyl</b> carbamazine <b>citrate</b> (DEC) and combined with albendazole. With the existence of this program, it is expected filariasis can be eliminated and worm infections can be controled. This study aims to determine the constraints and problems encountered in the implementation of filariasis elimination and helminth infections control. The method applied is a review of scientific article, policy inventory, discussions with experts and practitioners, as well as confirmation data in the field. This study known 233 districts/cities in Indonesia were endemic filariasis with mf rate average of 3. 61 %, and the prevalence of helminth disease in 173 districts/cities with an average of 28. 12 %. Among the 233 districts/cities endemic filariasis, 104 districts/cities were also endemic helminth diseases; and only 135 regencies/cities implemented MDA filariasis. Within the 135 districts/cities reported to implement MDA filariasis, only 16 districts/cities actually executed MDA with prevalence of helminth infections above 30 % (MDA helminth requirement). Recommendations is necessary to accelerate MDA filariasis in the district/city with endemic filariasis and also those with endemic helminth diseases above 30 %...|$|R
