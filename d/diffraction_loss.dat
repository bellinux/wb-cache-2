40|$|Thermal {{noise is}} {{expected}} to be the dominant source of noise in the most sensitive frequency band of second generation ground based gravitational wave detectors. Reshaping the beam to a flatter wider profile which probes more of the mirror surface reduces this noise. The "Mesa" beam shape has been proposed for this purpose and was subsequently generalized to a family of hyperboloidal beams with two parameters: twist angle alpha and beam width D. Varying alpha allows a continuous transition from the nearly-flat to the nearly-concentric Mesa beam configurations. We analytically prove that in the limit of infinite D hyperboloidal beams become Gaussians. The Advanced LIGO <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> design constraint is 1 ppm per bounce. In the past the <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> has often been calculated using the clipping approximation that, in general, underestimates the <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss.</b> We develop a code using pseudo-spectral methods to compute the <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> directly from the propagator. We find that the <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> is not a strictly monotonic function of beam width, but has local minima that occur due to finite mirror effects and leads to natural choices of D. For the Mesa beam a local minimum occurs at D = 10. 67 cm and leads to a <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> of 1. 4 ppm. We find that if one requires a <b>diffraction</b> <b>loss</b> of strictly 1 ppm, the alpha = 0. 91 pi hyperboloidal beam is optimal, leading to the coating thermal noise being lower by about 10 % than for a Mesa beam while other types of thermal noise decrease as well. We then develop an iterative process that reconstructs the mirror to specifically account for finite mirror effects. This allows us to increase the D parameter and lower the coating noise by about 30 % compared to the original Mesa configuration. Comment: 13 pages, 12 figures, 4 tables.

40|$|According to {{a recent}} {{proposal}} [S. Takayama et al., Appl. Phys. Lett. 87, 061107 (2005) ], the triangular lattice of triangular air holes may allow to achieve a complete photonic band gap in two-dimensional photonic crystal slabs. In this work we present a systematic theoretical study of this photonic lattice in a high-index membrane, and a comparison with the conventional triangular lattice of circular holes, {{by means of the}} guided-mode expansion method whose detailed formulation is described here. Photonic mode dispersion below and above the light line, gap maps, and intrinsic <b>diffraction</b> <b>losses</b> of quasi-guided modes are calculated for the periodic lattice as well as for line- and point-defects defined therein. The main results are summarized as follows: (i) the triangular lattice of triangular holes does indeed have a complete photonic band gap for the fundamental guided mode, but the useful region is generally limited by the presence of second-order waveguide modes; (ii) the lattice may support the usual photonic band gap for even modes (quasi-TE polarization) and several band gaps for odd modes (quasi-TM polarization), which could be tuned in order to achieve doubly-resonant frequency conversion between an even mode at the fundamental frequency and an odd mode at the second-harmonic frequency; (iii) <b>diffraction</b> <b>losses</b> of quasi-guided modes in the triangular lattices with circular and triangular holes, and in line-defect waveguides or point-defect cavities based on these geometries, are comparable. The results point to the interest of the triangular lattice of triangular holes for nonlinear optics, and show the usefulness of the guided-mode expansion method for calculating photonic band dispersion and <b>diffraction</b> <b>losses,</b> especially for higher-lying photonic modes.
