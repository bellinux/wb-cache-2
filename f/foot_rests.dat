5|$|Peake again painted Henry {{outdoors}} in about 1610. In this portrait, {{now at the}} Royal Palace of Turin, the prince looks hardly older than in the 1603 double portrait; but his left <b>foot</b> <b>rests</b> on a shield bearing the three-feathers device of the Prince of Wales, a title he did not hold until 1610. Henry is portrayed {{as a young man}} of action, about to draw a jewel-encrusted sword from its scabbard. The portrait was almost certainly sent to Savoy in connection with a marriage proposed in January 1611 between Henry and the Infanta Maria, daughter of Charles Emmanuel I, Duke of Savoy.|$|E

[...] The upper basin of the fountain, which is approximately [...] high and [...] wide and weighs 15 tons, {{is supported by a}} 8-ton shaft adorned with three allegorical figures, the Arts of Ocean Navigation. [...] The figures, which are approximately [...] tall and [...] wide and weigh 12 tons, represent the Sea, the Stars and the Wind. [...] The Sea is represented by a female figure with long hair holding a boat in her right hand while caressing a seagull on her shoulder with her left hand.

[...] The Wind is a nude male figure draped with a ship sail. [...] He is holding a conch shell with his left hand to use as a horn and is facing right. [...] The water pours over the upper basin into a large lower basin that is approximately [...] tall. [...] The inscription on the outer rim of the lower basin states: [...] "THIS MEMORIAL FOUNTAIN REPLACES A STATUE ERECTED BY THE CONGRESS OF THE UNITED STATES IN RECOGNITION OF HIS DISTINGUISHED SERVICES.

40|$|Expansive {{soils are}} highly {{susceptible}} to volumetric changes leading to rapid {{loss in the}} bearing capacity of footings resting on them. Among several techniques available to treat expansive soils, lime or fly ash stabilization gained prominence {{during the past few}} decades due to its abundance and adaptability. Chemical stabilization is widely used to treat expansive soils as it develops base exchange and cementation processes between clay particles. When expansive soils are treated with chemicals, it is essential to obtain the load-settlement response of <b>footing</b> <b>resting</b> on stabilized ground. In this study, Finite Element Analysis is performed using the commercial software, PLAXIS 2 D, to obtain the load-settlement response of a strip <b>footing</b> <b>resting</b> on untreated and treated expansive soil.

2500|$|Continental {{had begun}} {{deploying}} BusinessFirst seats that allowed customers to lie completely flat, reclining 180-degrees and providing [...] of sleeping {{space in the}} fully extended position on its 777-200ER and 757-200 aircraft. The Flat Bed Seat offered a seat measuring up to [...] wide when the adjustable armrest was positioned flush with the seat cushion. Electronic controls enabled customers to easily move the seats to an infinite combination of seat adjustments, including lumbar support, leg and <b>foot</b> <b>rests.</b> iPod connectivity was available in the Flat Bed Seat. The new BusinessFirst seats had a six-way adjustable head rest, an individual overhead reading light and an adjustable seat light allowing customers to read in bed without disturbing their neighbor and a privacy shell that allowed for seclusion from other travelers. BusinessFirst customers also received {{one of the highest}} crew to passenger ratios (1:8) among all international business class products.|$|E
2500|$|As {{a patron}} entered the front doors, {{he would have}} {{found himself in a}} lobby with two {{stairwells}} leading up to the balcony, a manager's office, and a smoking room. [...] Upon stepping through the terracotta leather covered and gold trimmed wooden doors into the auditorium, a patron would have been softly bathed in the shimmering glow of 94 gas lights. [...] These lights, were crafted of polished brass and fitted with etched glass globes. [...] The stage itself was equipped with 174 gas lights. [...] All the lights in the entire theatre were controlled from the stage by means of a pipe system, allowing the stage manager to ignite or extinguish any or all of these brilliant lights in an instant. [...] Beneath a dome resplendent with painted cherubs, a large chandelier, known as an [...] "Opal glass reflector", scattered sparkles of reflected light over all. [...] Elegant red Brussels' carpet softened patrons' steps, and grand opera chairs, upholstered in dark Cardinal plush awaited to seat them. [...] These chairs were engraved with the monogram, B.S.T., Barton Tibbits' initials, and many of these chairs offered <b>foot</b> <b>rests</b> and hat and umbrella racks. [...] Amazingly the auditorium originally held 1,000 seats for patrons. [...] The seating area was divided into the parquet and the parquet circle – two separate areas {{on the floor in front}} of the orchestra pit. [...] The walls of the auditorium, colored in cameo tints and dashes of cardinal, green, and gold color in [...] "conventional figures" [...] produced [...] "a warm, sunny effect and [...] the auditorium a bright and airy appearance which is very pleasing." [...] Dominating the scene was a grandly ornate -wide by -long proscenium stage with elegant opera boxes situated within the massive tin and plaster arch.|$|E

60|$|The {{ornament}} {{in question}} {{is a group of}} statuary in bronze, elevated upon a marble pedestal and basement, representing Lord Nelson expiring in the arms of Victory. One <b>foot</b> <b>rests</b> on a rolling foe, and the other on a cannon. Victory is dropping a wreath on the dying admiral's brow; while Death, under the similitude of a hideous skeleton, is insinuating his bony hand under the hero's robe, and groping after his heart. A very striking design, and true to the imagination; I never could look at Death without a shudder.|$|E
60|$|Two {{of these}} winding tunnels stand {{as proof of}} Nature's mining abilities. Their floors are level, they are seven feet wide, and their roofs are gently arched. Their height is not uniform, however. We passed through one a hundred feet long, which leads through a spur {{of the hill and}} opens out well up in the sheer wall of a precipice whose <b>foot</b> <b>rests</b> in the waves of the sea. It is a commodious tunnel, except that there are {{occasional}} places in it where one must stoop to pass under. The roof is lava, of course, and is thickly studded with little lava-pointed icicles an inch long, which hardened as they dripped. They project as closely together as the iron teeth of a corn-sheller, and if one will stand up straight and walk any distance there, he can get his hair combed free of charge.|$|E
