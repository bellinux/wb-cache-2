But {{this does not}} imply that improved <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> is worthless: higher <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> enables greater production and a higher material quality of life. For example, a more efficient steam engine allowed the cheaper transport of goods and people that contributed to the Industrial Revolution. However, if the Khazzoom–Brookes postulate is correct, increased <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency,</b> by itself, will not reduce the rate of depletion of fossil fuels.|$|E

These experiments have provided a variety of conditions in which to examine the <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> of pellets injected into DIII-D plasmas. The <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> defined as the total increase in number of plasma electrons divided {{by the number of}} pellet fuel atoms, is determined by measurements of density profiles before and just after pellet injection. The authors have found that there is a decrease in the pellet <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> with increased neutral beam injection power. The pellet penetration depth also decreases with increased neutral beam injection power so that, in general, <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases with penetration depth. The <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> is generally 25 % lower in ELMing H-mode discharges than in L-mode due to an expulsion of particles with a pellet triggered ELM. A comparison with <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> data from other tokamaks shows similar behavior...|$|R
40|$|The authors {{present a}} {{comparison}} of the wall deuterium retention and plasma fueling requirements of three diverted tokamaks, DIII-D, TdeV, and ASDEX-Upgrade, with different fractions of graphite coverage of stainless steel or Inconel outer walls and different heating modes. Data from particle balance experiments on each tokamak demonstrate well-defined differences in wall retention of deuterium gas, even though all three tokamaks have complete graphite coverage of divertor components and all three are routinely boronized. This paper compares the evolution of the change in wall loading and net <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> for gas during dedicated experiments without Helium Glow Discharge Cleaning on the DIII-D and TdeV tokamaks. On the DIII-D tokamak, it was demonstrated that the wall loading could be increased by > 1, 250 Torr- 1 (equivalent to 150 {times} plasma particle content) plasma inventories resulting in an increase in <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> from 0. 08 to 0. 25, whereas the wall loading on the TdeV tokamak could only be increased by < 35 Torr-{ell} (equivalent to 50 {times} plasma particle content) plasma inventories at a maximum <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> {approximately} 1.

5|$|The Jevons {{paradox is}} {{sometimes}} used {{to argue that}} energy conservation efforts are futile, for example, that more efficient use of oil will lead to increased demand, and will not slow the arrival or the effects of peak oil. This argument is usually presented as a reason not to enact environmental policies or pursue <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> (e.g. if cars are more efficient, it will simply lead to more driving). Several points have been raised against this argument. First, {{in the context of}} a mature market such as for oil in developed countries, the direct rebound effect is usually small, and so increased <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> usually reduces resource use, other conditions remaining constant. Second, even if increased efficiency does not reduce the total amount of fuel used, there remain other benefits associated with improved efficiency. For example, increased <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> may mitigate the price increases, shortages and disruptions in the global economy associated with peak oil. Third, environmental economists have pointed out that fuel use will unambiguously decrease if increased efficiency is coupled with an intervention (e.g. a fuel tax) that keeps the cost of fuel use the same or higher.|$|E
5|$|Airbus briefly {{considered}} the variable camber wing, {{a concept that}} requires changing the wing profile for a given phase of flight. Studies were carried out by British Aerospace (BAe), now part of BAE Systems, at Hatfield and Bristol. Airbus estimated this would yield a two per cent improvement in aerodynamic efficiency, but the feature was rejected because of cost and difficulty of development. A true laminar flow wing (a low-drag shape that improves <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency)</b> was also considered but rejected.|$|E
5|$|Another of Harrison's goals was {{to raise}} {{the morale of the}} {{workforce}} and locomotive engineers; crews were assigned to the same locomotives, and senior engineers were allowed to paint their names on their engines. When business declined in 1914 Harrison reduced his salary by 20percent, but introduced smaller and graduated cuts for other staff, with the smallest percentages at the lowest pay scales. Other efforts to improve morale included rewards for <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> and the improvement of safety, including stricter investigation of accidents.|$|E
30|$|The market {{expansion}} {{of new and}} used passenger cars also affects the environment, because expanding the market of new passenger cars with relatively high <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (km/l) contributes to reducing CO 2 emissions during the driving phase, whereas it increases CO 2 emissions in the car manufacturing phase (Kagawa et al. 2011). An {{important point is that}} expanding the market of used cars with relatively low <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> conversely contributes to increasing CO 2 emissions in the driving phase, whereas zero emission is achieved the car manufacturing phase. Regarding the use of used products, Curran (2010) showed that extending product life spans through the reuse of furniture and appliances in the UK has an effect on reducing waste and raw materials. There are two relevant previous studies on life-cycle emissions in the driving phase that include the impact of the <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of motor vehicles and their annual travel distance: Ou et al. (2010) and Pauliuk et al. (2012).|$|R

The observed carbon <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> from injecting methane gas was similar in reverse and normal field. EDGE 2 D modeling used an externally applied force to create the SOL flows, without specifying {{the origin of the}} force. The resulting flow agreed reasonably with the experimental values between the separatrix and 4 cm mid-plane depth in the SOL. The effect of the flow on the calculated carbon screening was 5 to 15 % higher carbon <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> for the low flow velocity with reverse field...|$|R
40|$|A {{fueling system}} by {{supersonic}} pulsed gas injection has been {{installed on the}} high field side of Tore Supra. First results are encouraging, demonstrating a <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> four times {{higher than that of}} conventional gas puff. One-dimensional modeling shows that the increase of efficiency is linked to the short injection time and to the prompt cooling of the plasma edge consecutive to the massive injection of matter. Improvements of the system could lead to the formation of a high-P blob which could experience a drift down the magnetic field, analogously to pellet injection, thus further increasing the <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the method.

They had retractable canards for better low-speed control, turbojet engines providing nearly the <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> {{and range of}} Concorde and {{a top speed of}} Mach 2.35. Passenger service commenced in November 1977, but after the 1978 crash the aircraft was taken out of service. The aircraft had an inherently unsafe structural design as a consequence of an automated production method chosen to simplify and speed up manufacturing.|$|E
5|$|The body shell, {{suspension}} and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight, improving handling and <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Changes {{to the model}} line-up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate (which was merged with the standard Calais variant, represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore's line-up) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1970s, {{operating}} cost replaced capacity {{as the primary}} factor in airliner purchases. As a result, the 767's design process emphasized <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> from the outset. Boeing targeted a 20 to 30percent cost saving over earlier aircraft, mainly through new engine and wing technology. As development progressed, engineers used computer-aided design for {{over a third of}} the 767's design drawings, and performed 26,000 hours of wind tunnel tests. Design work occurred concurrently with the 757 twinjet, leading Boeing to treat both as almost one program to reduce risk and cost. Both aircraft would ultimately receive shared design features, including avionics, flight management systems, instruments, and handling characteristics. Combined development costs were estimated at $3.5 to $4billion.|$|E
2500|$|The Wankel engine's {{drawbacks}} {{of inadequate}} lubrication and cooling in ambient temperatures, short engine lifespan, high emissions and low <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were tackled by Norton rotary engine specialist David Garside, who developed three patented systems in 2016.|$|R
40|$|The problem {{discussed}} in {{this paper is to}} determine the range of a fleet of n aircraft with fuel capacities g gallons and <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> ri gallons per mile (i= 1, [...] ., n). It is assumed that the aircraft may share fuel in flight and that any of the aircraft may be abandoned at any stage. The range is defined to be the greatest distance which can be attained in this way. Initially the fleet is supposed to have g gallons of fuel. A theoretical solution is obtained by the method which Richard Bellman [1] calls dynamic programming. Explicit solutions are obtained in the case of two aircraft with different fuel capacities and <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> {{and in the case of}} any number of aircraft with identical fuel capacities and identical <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> The problem is similar to the so-called jeep problem. The jeep problem was solved rigorously by N. J. Fine [2]. A solution was also obtained by O. Helmer [3, 4]. Fine cited an unpublished solution by L. Alaoglu. The problem was generalized by C. G. Phipps [5]. Phipps informally developed the special result which is deduced in [section] 4 of this paper...|$|R
40|$|Plasma {{impurity}} content {{depends upon}} the impurity sources, <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and confinement. In JET [Joint European Torus], carbon is the primary impurity, and its <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> has been studied using methane gas injection and modeled with the SOL [scrape-off layer] codes: DIVIMP and EDGE 2 D. In this paper, EDGE 2 D modeling of similar AUG [ASDEX-Upgrade] experiments and projections to ITER are described. The parameters have been identified which govern the size scaling of carbon screening. Size scaling is complex. For carbon injected from the main chamber, the important factors include: the SOL temperature, {{the magnitude of the}} thermal force at the divertor entrance, and the parallel distance to the divertor. For carbon injected at the strike points, the intersection of the carbon ionization region with the region of strong thermal force determines the carbon <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> ITER projects to have much better carbon screening than JET. The ITER SOL is hotter so that main chamber carbon is ionized further from the separatrix making the calculated carbon <b>fueling</b> <b>efficiency</b> lower. Also, the carbon originating near the strike point has less chance of escaping the divertor by factors of about 100. The carbon sputtering is projected to be larger by similar factors, making the projected ITER core contamination similar to JET. However, that result is based upon the assumption that the wall materials have similar composition and behavior as observed on JET. A general result is that the core contamination at fixed total sputtering rate and core impurity confinement increases when the fraction of carbon ionized in the main chamber SOL increases, and decreases for larger machine size and higher density operation...|$|R
5|$|In {{the mid-1970s}} Airbus began {{development}} of the A300B9, a larger derivative of the A300, which would eventually become the A330. The B9 was essentially a lengthened A300 with the same wing, coupled with the most powerful turbofan engines available. It was targeted at the growing demand for high-capacity, medium-range, transcontinental trunk routes. Offering the same range and payload as the McDonnell Douglas DC-10 but with 25 per cent more <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency,</b> the B9 {{was seen as a}} viable replacement for the DC-10 and the Lockheed L-1011 TriStar trijets.

5|$|Mindful of {{the long}} time {{required}} to bring the 777X to the market, Boeing continued to develop improvement packages which improve <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency,</b> as well as lower prices for the existing product. As of February 2015, the backlog of undelivered 777s totals 278 aircraft, representing just under three years of current production at 8.3 aircraft per month, causing Boeing to ponder the 2018-2020 time frame. In January 2015, United Airlines ordered 10 Boeing 777-300ERs, normally costing around $150 million each but paid around $130 million, a discount to bridge the production gap to the 777X.|$|E

5|$|The fan {{diameter}} {{varies with}} the different models of the CFM56, and that change has {{a direct impact on}} the engine performance. For example, the low-pressure shaft rotates at the same speed for both the CFM56-2 and the CFM56-3 models; the fan diameter is smaller on the -3, which lowers the tip speed of the fan blades. The lower speed allows the fan blades to operate more efficiently (5.5% more in this case), which increases the overall <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the engine (improving specific fuel consumption nearly 3%).|$|E
5|$|With {{the fuel}} price {{increases}} of the 2000s, the EPA and many companies {{have sought to}} increase diesel truck fuel economy. One such example is the hydraulic hybrid vehicle, which stores energy in hydraulic tanks and hydraulic motors (as opposed to the electric hybrid vehicle which uses batteries and regenerative brakes). Electric hybrid vehicles are another option, with savings of 35 to 60 percent over traditional vehicles. Drivers themselves may improve <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> by using a method called progressive shifting, in which the driver shifts through the gears (typical trucks may have between 10 and 18 gears) {{in such a manner}} as to optimize the power range of the engine.|$|E
30|$|In July 2001, the Japanese Ministry of Economy, Trade, and Industry (METI), the Ministry of the Environment (MOE), and the Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, Transport, and Tourism (MLIT) jointly {{implemented}} the “Action Plan for the Development and Diffusion of Low-emission Vehicles”. The action plan promotes {{the use of}} cars powered by natural gas (CNG), electricity, methanol, and hybrid cars that have higher <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> (METI [2011]). In the same year, anti-pollution incentives were incorporated into the car taxation system. Specifically, the special measures adopted for calculating tax rates included the following: taxes were reduced for cars with low environmental loads (i.e., cars with higher <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiencies</b> and low gas emissions) and taxes were raised by approximately 10 % for cars that were older than a specified number of years (13 years after registration for gasoline-powered cars and 11 years for diesel-powered cars).|$|R

5|$|Because the {{aviation}} industry is especially {{sensitive to the}} weather, accurate weather forecasting is essential. Fog or exceptionally low ceilings can prevent many aircraft from landing and taking off. Turbulence and icing are also significant in-flight hazards. Thunderstorms are a problem for all aircraft because of severe turbulence due to their updrafts and outflow boundaries, icing due to the heavy precipitation, as well as large hail, strong winds, and lightning, {{all of which can}} cause severe damage to an aircraft in flight. Volcanic ash is also a significant problem for aviation, as aircraft can lose engine power within ash clouds. On a day-to-day basis airliners are routed {{to take advantage of the}} jet stream tailwind to improve <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Aircrews are briefed prior to takeoff on the conditions to expect en route and at their destination. Additionally, airports often change which runway is being used to take advantage of a headwind. This reduces the distance required for takeoff, and eliminates potential crosswinds.|$|E

He further added that the car's performance issues could be traced back to a lack of outright power and poor <b>fuel</b> <b>efficiency</b> from the engine. Éric Boullier, the team principal, further suggested that the main problem that the team faced was improving the efficiency of the RA615H's energy recovery systems, both in harvesting and deploying the additional power, and that by developing these areas, the car could make up several seconds on lap time, enough for the car to compete regularly for podium finishes.|$|E

Initial targets included the reuse of treated wastewater for non-potable uses and zero discharge of solid waste into the sea. For economic and other reasons, as well as to reduce energy consumption from incineration, some of these measures were not implemented. Queen Mary 2s environmental performance nevertheless is an improvement from that of many older ships, as well as international standards on waste.|$|E
