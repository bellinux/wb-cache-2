5|$|The Driffield Navigation, Leven Canal, Market Weighton Canal and Pocklington Canal offer <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> tranquillity.

5|$|Max Eckhardt's Shiny Brite company {{manufactured}} colorful glass ornaments in {{a variety}} of sizes and shapes through the era.

The reds and greens of the past were supplemented with turquoise, chartreuse, orange, purple, and other vibrant colors.|$|E
5|$|A {{teaser trailer}} has been {{released}} on 5 November 2012. The teaser shows Björk stuck in a bed of quicksand, wearing a blue wig. The video was premiered at an exclusive screening at the MOCA Grand Avenue on November 12, 2012. It was digitally released on November 13, 2012 on MOCA YouTube's channel, MOCAtv, {{as part of a}} series of music videos called ART+MUSIC which features collaborations between artists and musicians. The channel also posted a behind-the-scenes video on the same day. The video features <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> filming and an interview with the director of the video, who explains the filming process.|$|E

5|$|According to {{continuation}} Bond author Raymond Benson, {{there was}} {{further development of}} the Bond character in Thunderball, with <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> both his sense of humour and his own sense of mortality being shown. Felix Leiter had his largest role to date in a Bond story and much of his humour came though, whilst his incapacity, suffered in Live and Let Die, had not led to bitterness or to his being unable to join in with the underwater fight scene {{towards the end of}} the novel.|$|E
5|$|After a {{year away}} from the bike, Marchant {{returned}} to cycling and turned professional in 1958. Within a year he left for Europe with Ron Murray and Alan McLellan on the professional racing circuit. The trip was unsuccessful. The group did not take their track bikes with them, with Marchant ordering one from Italy. The equipment never arrived and he competed in Belgium and Copenhagen on borrowed bikes. Marchant only displayed <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> his ability, defeating the Italian champion in one outing and also winning the La Trobe race in Tasmania. Marchant then retired in 1961.|$|E
5|$|Between 355 and 351BC, Demosthenes {{continued}} practising law privately {{while he}} was becoming increasingly interested in public affairs. During this period, he wrote Against Androtion and Against Leptines, two fierce attacks on individuals who attempted to repeal certain tax exemptions. In Against Timocrates and Against Aristocrates, he advocated eliminating corruption. All these speeches, which offer early <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> his general principles on foreign policy, such as {{the importance of the}} navy, of alliances and of national honour, are prosecutions (graphē paranómōn) against individuals accused of illegally proposing legislative texts.|$|E

5|$|In Demosthenes's initial {{judicial}} orations, {{the influence}} of both Lysias and Isaeus is obvious, but his marked, original style is already revealed. Most of his extant speeches for private cases—written early in his career—show <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> talent: a powerful intellectual drive, masterly selection (and omission) of facts, and a confident assertion of the justice of his case, all ensuring the dominance of his viewpoint over his rival. However, {{at this early stage}} of his career, his writing was not yet remarkable for its subtlety, verbal precision and variety of effects.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sequel}} series' first season, Avatar Aang's spirit {{occasionally}} {{serves as the}} spiritual advisor to seventeen-year-old Korra (much like the previous Avatar incarnation, Roku, did for Aang). Initially, Aang is only able to give Korra <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> his memory concerning Yakone in relation to her confrontations with his two sons, Amon and Tarrlok, the products of Yakone's Bloodbending vendetta on the Avatar. It is only after she loses her ability to bend that Korra allows herself {{to listen to her}} past lives, at which point Aang restores her powers by triggering the Avatar State and teaching her to Energybend.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the Beirut law school's {{curriculum}} before the 5th century. The Scholia Sinaitica and the Scholia to the Basilica provide <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> the school's teaching method, comparable to the method of rhetoric schools at the time. The lecturer would discuss and analyze juridic texts by adding his own comments, which included references to analogous passages from imperial constitutions or from the works of prominent classical Roman jurists, such as Ulpian. He would then formulate the general legal principles and use these to resolve legal problems inspired from actual, practical cases. This method differed from the scheme of classical times in which the student had to master the law basics before engaging in case studies.|$|E

5|$|The {{character}} of Samson, the diminutive co-manager of the carnival, sets up each {{season with a}} monologue, giving <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> the show's complex story and good-versus-evil mythology. By telling the story visually and deploying dialogue sparely, Carnivàle is a demanding show {{with a lot of}} subtext, and similar to reading chapters of a book, viewers need to watch episodes of Carnivàle in the right order or risk being spoiled with too little or too much story information. Many reviewers found the story too slow and confusing, but praised the show for its cinematography and realistic portrayal of the 1930s. Carnivàle received much award recognition in mostly technical categories, including fifteen Emmy nominations with five wins.|$|E
5|$|The show {{centers on}} FBI special agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) {{who work on}} cases linked to the paranormal, called X-Files. Mulder is a believer in the paranormal, while the skeptical Scully has been {{assigned}} to debunk his work. In this episode, Mulder wakes up in a hotel with blood all over him and no memory of what happened. Mulder and Scully soon discover that Mulder {{was involved in a}} double homicide and may have been the killer. It is soon revealed that Mulder had been seeing a doctor who had allowed him to view <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> his past memories. After evidence becomes paramount, Mulder is cleared of the murder charges.|$|E
5|$|Nicolas Roeg had {{employed}} the fractured editing style of Don't Look Now on his previous films, Performance and Walkabout, {{but it was}} originated by editor Antony Gibbs on Petulia. Roeg served as the cinematographer on Petulia, which incidentally also starred Julie Christie, and Gibbs went on to edit Performance and Walkabout for Roeg. Roeg's use of colour—especially red—can {{be traced back to}} earlier work: both Performance and Walkabout feature scenes where the whole screen turns red, similar in nature to the scene during Christine's drowning when the spilt water on the church slide causes a reaction that makes it—along with the whole screen—turn completely red. The mysterious red-coated figure and its association with death has a direct parallel with an earlier film Roeg worked on as cinematographer, The Masque of the Red Death, which depicted a red clad Grim Reaper character. The fleeting <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> the mysterious red-coated figure possibly draw on Proust: in Remembrance of Things Past, while in Venice, the narrator catches sight of a red gown in the distance which brings pack painful memories of his lost love.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with several scenes interspersing, {{starting}} with Carey underwater, while holding onto a dolphins fin, {{as well as}} Carey lying on a beach at night in a bikini. As the song's introduction plays, scenes of the Hawaii beaches are shown, as well as close-up <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> T.I. Carey then is shown inside a small cabana, singing to the camera and enjoying herself at a small party. Similar scenes of Carey in a gold bikini are shown, {{as well as more}} scenes of Hawaiian landscape. By the second verse, Carey, now in a black bikini, is shown {{at the bottom of a}} ravine by the beach staring at the sun, then altering to scenes of the party once more. As T.I.'s verse starts, he's shown behind a waterfall, in the midst of shrubbery outside, where Mariah then appears sitting in a large body of clear water with golden sand. She then lies in the water, as the scene then switches to her underwater with the dolphin again.|$|E
5|$|The player {{continues}} to {{journey into the}} remains of a once sprawling city {{at the base of the}} mountain. Eventually making it safely to the mountain, the traveler begins to climb it, struggling as they enter the colder climates and encounter deep snow and high winds. With the crevice still a fair distance away, the traveler falls and collapses in the snow. Six of the white-robed figures appear before the character and grant the traveler new energy, allowing the player to reach the summit of the mountain and walk into the crevice as the screen fills with white. The player is then shown the game's credits, playing over the ending cinematic scene. This scene shows a shooting star emanating from the crevice and traversing the path the traveler took through the ruins, and shows <b>glimpses</b> <b>of</b> other robed travelers heading towards the mountain. Eventually, the star comes to rest at the sand dune where the game began, and the player is given the option of starting the game again. As the credits end, the player is shown the PlayStation Network IDs of the other travelers who shared part of the trek.|$|E
