40|$|The {{geographic}} {{organization of}} surface deformation on Venus as on Earth {{is a key}} to understanding the global tectonic system. To date we have mapped the distribution of three unambiguous tectonic land forms on Venus: (1) linear <b>foldbelts</b> analogous to those at plate margins of the Earth; (2) linear rift zones, analogous to continental rifts on the Earth; and (3) distributed plains deformation in the form of wrinkle ridges and extensional faults and fractures. The linear <b>foldbelts</b> are the dominant structural style in the Northern Hemisphere; ninety percent of the planet's <b>foldbelts</b> lie above the equator. In contrast, compressive deformation in the Southern Hemisphere is dominated by two large, sweeping patterns of wrinkle ridges. The two hemispheres are divided by an equatorial region that is largely covered by rift zones and several large tessera blocks. A tectonic model of generally poleward convergence of the Northern Hemisphere explains the distribution of <b>foldbelts</b> and rift zones. In our model, a northern hemispherical plate (or system of plates) moves poleward and deforms along discrete, predominately longitudinal bands. We recognize four types of <b>foldbelts</b> based on their relationships to other large-scale tectonic features on Venus. There are <b>foldbelts</b> that lie within the low plains, <b>foldbelts</b> associated with coronae, novae and chasmata, <b>foldbelts</b> that lie at the margins of poly-deformed tessera plateaus, and the folded mountain belts around Lakshmi Planum. We see a geometric increase in the area of fold belts when normalized to percent area at a given latitude. This increase is consistent with our model of poleward convergence. Also, the orientations of most <b>foldbelts</b> are either approximately north-south or parallel to lines of latitude in the northern hemisphere. This observation is also consistent with the model in that the longitudinal bands are the result of the decreasing area of the sphere as the plate moves poleward and the latitudinal belts are the direct result of poleward compression. The trends of wrinkle ridges have been mapped over the planet and several large, sweeping patterns evidently reflect long-wavelength topography. Using wrinkle ridges as paleostress indicators, we have developed local and regional stress trajectory maps...|$|R

40|$|There {{is ample}} field {{evidence}} that the deformation of glacial sediment {{in the front of}} advancing glaciers produces distinct compressional features that are comparable to those in tectonic <b>foldbelts.</b> Like the deformation that occurs in thin-skinned contractional belts, glaciotectonic push moraines often possess an arcuate shape. In order to understand how glaciotectonic ridges are formed, and to provide a basis for comparison with field observations, it is essential to model this environment in the laboratory. By appropriately scaling the mechanics and composition of the push moraine, a laboratory model can encompass the basic physics that control the formation of glacial ridges and also allow the calculation of strain orientations resulting from their formation.

50|$|The {{public domain}} U.S. Geological Survey Bulletin 2201-G {{describes}} the basin as follows.The basin occupies a swampy plain between the Ural Mountainsand the Yenisey River. On the north, the basin extends offshoreinto the southern Kara Sea. On the west, north, and east, thebasin {{is surrounded by}} the Ural, Yenisey Ridge, and Turukhan-Igarka foldbelts that experienced major deformations during theHercynian tectonic event and the Novaya Zemlya <b>foldbelt</b> thatwas deformed in early Cimmerian (Triassic) time. On the south,the folded Caledonian structures of the Central Kazakhstan andAltay-Sayan regions dip northward beneath the basin’s sedimentarycover. The basin is a relatively undeformed Mesozoic sagthat overlies the Hercynian accreted terrane and the Early Triassicrift system. The basement is composed of foldbelts that weredeformed in Late Carboniferous-Permian time during collisionof the Siberian and Kazakhstan continents with the Russian craton.The basement also includes several microcontinental blockswith a relatively undeformed Paleozoic sedimentary sequence.The sedimentary succession of the basin is composed ofMiddle Triassic through Tertiary clastic rocks. The lower part ofthis succession is present only {{in the northern part}} of the basin;southward, progressively younger strata onlap the basement, sothat in the southern areas the basement is overlain by Toarcianand younger rocks. The important stage in tectono-stratigraphicdevelopment of the basin was formation of a deep-water sea inVolgian-early Berriasian time. The sea covered more than one million km2 in the central basin area. Highly organic-richsiliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation were depositedduring this time in anoxic conditions on the sea bottom. Rocksof this formation have generated more than 80 percent of WestSiberian oil reserves and probably a substantial part of its gasreserves. The deep-water basin was filled by prograding clasticclinoforms during Neocomian time. The clastic material wastransported by a system of rivers dominantly from the easternprovenance. Sandstones within the Neocomian clinoforms containthe principal oil reservoirs. The thick continental Aptian-Cenomanian Pokur Formation above the Neocomian sequencecontains giant gas reserves {{in the northern part of}} the basin.Three total petroleum systems are identified in the WestSiberian basin. Volumes of discovered hydrocarbons in thesesystems are 144 billion barrels of oil and more than 1,300trillion cubic feet of gas. The assessed mean undiscoveredresources are 55.2 billion barrels of oil, 642.9 trillion cubic feetof gas, and 20.5 billion barrels of natural gas liquids.The largest known oil reserves are in the Bazhenov-Neocomian Total PetroleumSystem that includes Upper Jurassic and younger rocksof the central and southern parts of the basin. Oil reservoirs aremainly in Neocomian and Upper Jurassic clastic strata. Sourcerocks are organic-rich siliceous shales of the Bazhenov Formation.Most discovered reserves are in structural traps, but stratigraphictraps in the Neocomian clinoform sequence are productiveand are expected to contain much of the undiscoveredresources. Two assessment units are identified in this total petroleumsystem. The first assessment unit includes all conventionalreservoirs in the stratigraphic interval from the Upper Jurassic tothe Cenomanian. The second unit includes unconventional (orcontinuous), self-sourced, fractured reservoirs in the BazhenovFormation. This unit was not assessed quantitatively.The Togur-Tyumen Total Petroleum System covers thesame geographic area as the Bazhenov-Neocomian system, butit includes older, Lower-Middle Jurassic strata and weatheredrocks at the top of the pre-Jurassic sequence. A Callovianregional shale seal of the Abalak and lower Vasyugan Formationsseparates the two systems. The Togur-Tyumen system isoil-prone; gas reserves are insignificant. The principal oilreserves are in sandstone reservoirs at the top and bottom of theLower-Middle Jurassic Tyumen Formation; comparativelysmall reserves are in pre-Jurassic carbonate and clastic rocks.The principal source rocks are lacustrine to marine shales of theToarcian Togur Bed. Traps are structural, stratigraphic, or acombination of the two. The total petroleum system was asssessedas a single assessment unit. Most of the undiscoveredresources are expected in stratigraphic and combination traps.The northern onshore and offshore parts of the basin areincluded in the Northern West Siberian Mesozoic CompositeTotal Petroleum System that encompasses the entire sedimentarycover. The system is strongly gas-prone; it contains giantgas reserves and comparatively small oil reserves. The majorpart of hydrocarbon reserves is dry gas in the upper Aptian-Cenomaniansandstones (Pokur Formation and equivalents). Smallerreserves of wet gas and some oil are in Jurassic and Neocomiansandstones. Source rocks for the dry gas in the Pokur Formationthat constitutes more than 80 percent of the hydrocarbonreserves are unknown. Wet Neocomian gas and oil were generatedfrom Jurassic source rocks, including the Bazhenov Formation.Almost all discovered reserves are in structural traps;however, stratigraphic traps in the Neocomian interval probablycontain large undiscovered gas resources. The onshore and offshoreparts of the total petroleum system were assessed as separateunits because of different exploration maturity and differentinfrastructure requirements. The onshore area is substantiallyexplored, especially in the shallow Aptian-Cenomaniansequence, whereas only three exploratory wells have been drilledoffshore. Undiscovered gas potential of both assessment units isvery high.|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1990 The Sulaiman <b>foldbelt</b> is {{an active}} and {{conspicuous}} tectonic feature on the northwestern margin of the Indo-Pakistani plate. Seismic reflection data have been combined with surface geological mapping and drillhole data to interpret the structural style and tectonic shortening of the eastern Sulaiman <b>foldbelt</b> and its adjacent foredeep. The data show that the basement is more than 8 km deep near the deformation front and that it deepens towards the west. The foredeep adjacent to the eastern Sulaiman <b>foldbelt</b> is a broad synclinal structure, with a steep western limb; the more gentle eastern limb has monoclinal dips from near zero to 2. 5 °. Several salt-cored anticlines are observed on {{the eastern part of}} the monocline, but the salt structures are lacking in the western foredeep and in the frontal part of the Sulaiman <b>foldbelt.</b> The basal decollement under the Sulaiman lobe lies either in ductile Eocambrian salt, or within a deep zone of other material that undergoes ductile behavior. Near the deformation front, ramps from the basal detachment become flats in lower Triassic and lower Cretaceous shales. A steep and highly elevated zone immediately to the west of frontal folds is interpreted to be underlain by a passive-roof duplex. The culmination wall of this oblique duplex is separated from the overlying roof sequence by a passive-roof thrust in lower Cretaceous shales. The roof-thrust has a back-thrust sense of movement, relative to the forelandward propagating duplex, and may extend obliquely 100 km into the interior of the <b>foldbelt.</b> Fault-propagation and fault-bend folds are present in the frontal portion of the eastern Sulaiman <b>foldbelt.</b> Palinspastic restoration of a balanced cross-section shows 108 km of shortening in the eastern Sulaiman <b>foldbelt</b> east of the Kingri strike-slip fault. The presence of more than 11 km of pre-Neogene strata on top of basement suggests that the Mesozoic rifted margin of the Indian subcontinent may lie beneath the Sulaiman <b>foldbelt.</b> This interpretation is also favored by the presence of ophiolites and flysch deposits overthrusted on late Cretaceous shelf strata...|$|E
40|$|The Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> {{is part of}} the Prypiat-Dnieper-Donets intracratonic rift basin (Belarus-Ukraine-southern Russia) that {{developed}} in Late Devonian times and was reactivated in Early Carboniferous. To the southeast, the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> joins the contiguous, deformed Karpinsky Swell. Basin "inversions" led first to the uplift of the Palaeozoic series (mainly Carboniferous but also syn-rift Devonian strata in the southwesternmost part of the Donbas <b>Foldbelt,</b> which are deeply buried in the other parts of the rift system), and later to the formation of the fold-and-thrust belt. The general structural trend of the Donbas <b>Foldbelt,</b> formed mainly during rifting, is WNW-ESE. This is the strike of the main rift-related fault zones and also of the close to tight "Main Anticline" of the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> {{that developed}} along the previous rift axis. The Main Anticline is structurally unique in the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> and its formation was initiated in Permian times, during a period of (trans) tensional reactivation, during which active salt movements occurred. A relief inversion of the basin also took place at this time with a pronounced uplift of the southern margin of the basin and the adjacent Ukrainian Shield. Subsequently, Cimmerian and Alpine phases of tectonic inversion of the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> {{led to the development of}} flat and shallow thrusts commonly associated with folds into the basin. A fan-shaped deformation pattern is recognised in the field, with south-to southeast-vergent compressive structures, south of the Main Anticline, and north- to northwest-vergent ones, north of it. These compressive structures are clearly superimposed onto the WNW-ESE structural grain of the initial rift basin. Shortening structures that characterise the tectonic inversion of the basin are (regionally) orientated NW-SE and N-S. Because of the obliquity of the compressive trends relative to the WNW-ESE strike of inherited structures (major preexisting normal faults and the Main Anticline), in addition to reverse displacements, right lateral movements occurred along the main boundary fault zones and along the faulted hinge of the Main Anticline. The existence of preexisting structures is also thought to be responsible for local deviations in contractional trends (that are E-W in the southwesternmost part of the basin). © 2003 Elsevier B. V.

The collision zones (sutures) between the terranes are dated by granitoids which melted from the crust of the terranes in two periods of time: 1. 9 and 1. 8 billion years ago. Local metamorphism and granite generation inside the collision (fault) zones were accompanied by synchronous areal dry granulite metamorphism in the adjacent terranes. This implies a fairly uniform field of high temperatures and pressures typical of the thicker crust of the collision prism.

The observations of the satellite GOCE have allowed to achieve a qualitative leap ahead in today’s global gravity. The new global field has an improved resolution of 80 km with precision of 5 mGal; this resolution is sufficient to study crustal thickness variations and the upper crustal structure. Geological macrostructures generating density variations are mapped for the first time by a global satellite derived field in continental areas, which opens a new series of applications in geophysical exploration. The study area is located in and around the Congo craton, which is a part of Africa poorly covered in ground gravity surveys, so that GOCE data are essential there. The GOCE gravity field is reduced by the effect of topography, of the isostatic crustal thickness and by sediments, obtaining the field representative of the geologic lineaments. The <b>foldbelts</b> surrounding the Congo craton are identified well through the field, generating signals near to 50 mGal. Compared to the existing geologic map, along the Kibalien belt, a narrow belt with increased density is distinguished, about 125 km wide, and 800 km long, that must be representative of a major compressive or magmatic geologic event that generated these rocks. The distinction of separate geologic units characterized by density variation is useful for identifying the areas where focused future geophysical and geologic mapping will be effective in the exploration of new mineral resources...|$|R

These source rocks are widely distributed and mature for oil and gas generation across the Mesopotamian foredeep and Zagros <b>foldbelt.</b> Lesser amounts of oil and gas are derived from: 1) Upper and Lower Cretaceous oil-prone source rocks within the Zagros foldbelt; 2) Triassic oil-prone source rocks in northwestern Iraq; and 3) Silurian gas-prone source rocks in western Iraq. The oil generated from the Jurassic source rocks migrated vertically to fill stacked reservoir intervals in many fields. Lateral migration of oil occurred along the western margin of the Mesopotamian foredeep, as proven by small fields and large seeps that are located where source rocks are absent or immature for oil or gas generation. The tectonics and sedimentation during the Phanerozoic created the source-rich setting of Iraq. Sedimentation was widespread across Iraq during most of the Paleozoic, although intervals of strata are absent and interpreted either not to have been deposited or to have been eroded following deposition. A notable example is the absence of Early and Middle Devonian strata from Iraq. The distribution of Pre-Permian strata, including the gas-prone Silurian source rocks, and therefore the Paleozoic hydrocarbon system and plays, was controlled in large part by erosion at the unconformity that separates Late and Early Carboniferous. Following siliciclastic infill of the topography at this unconformity, Iraq was covered by platform-wide deposition of carbonate sediments on an east-dipping ramp in the Permian, Triassic, and Early Jurassic. Continental fragments rifted from the northern and eastern margins of Arabia during these times, after which a large portion of eastern Iraq subsided. This intra-shelf basin, named the Gotnia Basin, was the location of organic-rich “starved” sedimentation in the Middle to Late Jurassic that formed the important Sargelu and Naokelekan source rocks. The Gotnia Basin was rimmed by carbonate shelf margins. The Gotnia Basin filled with anhydrite and salt layers in the latest Jurassic and then continued to fill throughout the Cretaceous, primarily by prograding carbonate and siliciclastic sediments that entered the basin along the southern, western, and northern margins. These progradational deposits contain the major reservoir units of Iraq, whereas the basinal sediments include most of the sealing facies, predominantly marine shales, as well as some locally important source rocks. The basinal area continued to contract by sedimentary infill until the Turonian, when the Arabian plate was disturbed by a compressional event related to the initial closing of the Tethys Ocean. This event is marked by a hiatus in deposition and, at least locally, erosion at an unconformity. Faults were inverted and folding of anticlines in the Mesopotamian foredeep (and probably in the Zagros <b>foldbelt)</b> occurred at this event. Marine waters flooded across this unconformity in the Late Turonian and Coniacian, with renewed carbonate deposition. Ophiolites were obducted onto Arabia in the middle part of the Late Cretaceous and are present in far northeastern Iraq. At the same time, thick calcareous and muddy sediments filled rapidly subsiding extensional grabens present in western Iraq. A subsiding trough formed in the position of the existing Mesopotamian foredeep and Zagros <b>foldbelt</b> of Iraq, and siliciclastic sediments started to fill the deep-water trough from the north and northeast due to the encroaching Tethys closure. Basinal carbonate and shale were deposited {{in the center of the}} trough in the Paleocene and Eocene, while the basin was partly filled by prograding carbonate shelf margins located on the southwestern and north-eastern sides of the basin. This continued through the Oligocene and Early Miocene, until the remaining basins were filled with anhydrite of the Dhiban Formation and the overlying carbonates of the Jeribe Formation in the Early Miocene. Deposition throughout the Late Cretaceous and Cenozoic provided the burial for the Mesozoic source rocks to generate oil and gas. Closure of the Tethys Ocean continued, with local uplift and erosion of areas of Iraq in the Early Miocene. Thick evaporitic deposits of the Fatha Formation lap onto and over the older Cenozoic strata. The marine seaway along the Mesopotamian foredeep was closed by the Middle Miocene, with ensuing non-marine siliciclastic deposition and folding associated with west-verging shortening deformation in the Zagros <b>foldbelt.</b> Oil and gas plays are proven and their distribution is well known for the Cenozoic and most of the Cretaceous. The deeper plays of the Lower Cretaceous, Jurassic, and older reservoirs are less well explored in the Mesopotamian foredeep, Gotnia Basin, and Kirkuk embayment of the Zagros <b>foldbelt.</b> Exploration is occurring in the marginally drilled interior of the Kurdistan region of the Zagros <b>foldbelt</b> in northeastern Iraq. Paleozoic plays in western Iraq are also marginally explored...|$|E
40|$|The Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> (DF) is the uplifted and {{deformed}} {{part of the}} up to 20 -km-thick Dniepr-Donets Basin (DDB) {{that formed}} {{as the result of}} rifting of the East European Craton (EEC) in the Late Devonian. Uplift, especially of the southern margin of the basin, occurred in Early Permian times, in a (trans) tensional tectonic stress regime while folding and reverse faulting mainly occurred later-mainly during the Late Cretaceous. A seismic refraction/wide-angle reflection survey was carried out in 1999 (DOBREfraction' 99) to complement existing Deep Seismic Sounding (DSS) data from the area that did not record significant Pn phase arrivals because of insufficient maximum offset. DOBREfraction' 99 comprised some 245 recording stations along a line of 360 km length with 11 in-line shot points as well as a 100 km away, parallel 190 km long subsidiary fan profile. The main profile runs between the shores of the Azov Sea in the south to the Ukraine-Russia border in the north, across the Azov Massif (Ukrainian Shield), the <b>Foldbelt,</b> and the Voronezh Massif. Particular scientific targets include the nature of the crust-mantle transition and the geometry of crustal-upper mantle structures related to rifting and subsequent basin inversion. Tomographic inversion as well as ray-trace based velocity modelling has been carried out. The velocity signature of the sedimentary basin itself is well resolved, indicating an asymmetric form, with a steeper basement surface in the south than in the north, and a total thickness of about 20 km. A thick (> 10 km) high velocity (> 6. 9 km/s) lower crustal body lies beneath the rift basin itself, offset slightly to the north compared to the main basin depocentre, likely related to the rifting processes. Velocities in the crust below the Ukrainian Shield, south of the <b>Foldbelt,</b> are in general higher than beneath the Voronezh Massif to the north. The Moho displays only slight topography around a depth of 40 km along the profile. © 2003 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|The Carboniferous {{to early}} Permian {{apparent}} polar wander (APW) path for Eurasia {{is not well}} constrained, because of the paucity of reliable paleomagnetic poles. This is at least {{partly responsible for the}} Pangea A vs. B controversy in the early Permian: is the overlap between the northern and southern continents during the early Permian caused by a lack of reliable paleomagnetic data (Pangea A) or must a large displacement along a mega-shear zone be invoked (Pangea B) ? Here, we present results from six paleomagnetic sampling sites ranging in age from the early Carboniferous to the early Permian from sedimentary rocks in the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> (Ukraine) to improve the Carboniferous-early Permian APW path for Eurasia and to contribute to solving the Pangea A vs. B controversy. Six time intervals were sampled in the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> (eastern Ukraine), which was filled with sediments and volcanic units during the late Devonian to Permian syn- and post-rift subsidence phases. We present results from sediments that were corrected for inclination shallowing with the elongation/inclination (E/. I) method. We conclude that there is a general northward movement of the Donbas Foldbelt: the resulting paleolatitudes are slightly but generally significantly higher than expected from existing APW paths. The late Carboniferous to early Permian data provide three new reliable paleopoles for Eurasia. The early Permian pole does not necessarily require a Pangea B reconstruction. It results in higher paleolatitudes for Laurussia in the early Permian and removes the overlap between Gondwana and Pangea. We also reconstructed the position of Laurussia based on Carboniferous Laurentian poles recently corrected for inclination shallowing, which clearly favours a Pangea B configuration. It seems that the Pangea A vs. B debate is as lively as before. The three early Carboniferous paleopoles give reliable paleolatitudes, but declinations significantly deviate from the expected directions. We argue that the southernmost part of the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> underwent a counterclockwise rotation, related to Mesozoic compressional events that are recognised in paleostress analyses. © 2010 Elsevier B.

40|$|Two {{years of}} {{continuous}} recordings of ambient seismic noise observed at 354 stations in South China from 2009 to 2010 {{are used to}} estimate Rayleigh wave group and phase velocity maps from 6 to 40 s period. These results are merged with Rayleigh wave phase velocity maps from 25 to 70 s period derived from earthquakes {{in the same time}} frame. Eikonal tomography generates the dispersion maps, which, by Monte-Carlo inversion, are used to estimate a 3 -D Vsv model of the crust and upper mantle down to a depth of 150 km across all of South China with attendant uncertainties. A clear image emerges of the 'West Yangtze Block', a region of the western Yangtze Craton characterized by relatively thick crust (~ 40 km) overlying a seismic mantle lithosphere that extends to at least 150 km that may have been the nucleus for the formation of the Yangtze craton in the Archean and may present a present-day obstacle to the eastward expansion of Tibet. The West Yangtze Block contrasts with the thinner crust (~ 30 km) and mantle lithosphere (~ 70 - 80 km) beneath the eastern Yangtze Craton and South China <b>Foldbelt.</b> These observed differences are consistent with processes associated with flat slab subduction in the Mesozoic that may have eroded the lithosphere of the eastern Yangtze Craton and the South China <b>Foldbelt.</b> 19 page(s...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} an integrated geophysical {{study of the}} southern margin of the East European Craton (EEC) in the Karpinksy Swell-North Caucasus area. It presents new interpretations of deep refraction and wide-angle reflection "deep seismic sounding" (DSS) data as well as conventional seismic and CDP profiling and new analyses of potential field data, including three-dimensional gravity and magnetic modelling. An integrated model of the physical properties {{and structure of the}} Earth's crust and, partially, upper mantle displays distinct features that are related to tectonic history of the study area. The Voronezh Massif (VM), the Ukrainian Shield and Rostov Dome (RD) of the EEC as well as the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> (DF), Karpinsky Swell (KS), Scythian Plate (SP) and Precaspian Basin (PCB) constitute the geodynamic ensemble that developed on the southern margin of the continent Baltica. There proposed evolutionary model comprises a stage of rifting during the middle to late Devonian, post-rift extension and subsidence during Carboniferous-early Permian times (synchronous with and related to the southward displacement of the Rostov Dome and extension in a palaeo-Scythian back-arc basin), and subsequent Mesozoic and younger evolution. A pre-Ordovician, possibly Riphean (?), mafic magmatic complex is inferred on a near vertical reflection seismic cross-section through the western portion of the Astrakhan Dome in the southwest part of the Precaspian Basin. This complex combined with evidence of a subducting slab in the upper mantle imply the presence of pre-Ordovician (Riphean?) island arc, with synchronous extension in a Precaspian back-arc basin is suggested. A middle Palaeozoic back-arc basin ensemble in what is now the western Karpinsky Swell was more than 100 km to the south from its present location. The Stavropol High migrated northwards, dislocating and moving fragments of this back-arc basin sometime thereafter. Linear positive magnetic anomalies reflect the position of associated faults, which define the location of the eastern segment of the Karpinsky Swell. These faults, which dip northward, are recognised on crustal DSS profiles crossing the Donbas <b>Foldbelt</b> and Scythian Plate. They are interpreted in terms of compressional tectonics younger than the Hercynian stage of evolution (i. e., post-Palaeozoic). © 2004 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
