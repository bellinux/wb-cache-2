500|$|Allen {{has said}} that Match Point {{is one of his}} few [...] "A-films", and even [...] "arguably may be the best film that I've made. This is {{strictly}} accidental, it just happened to come out right. You know, <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> them all good, but some come out and some don't. With this one everything seemed to come out right. The actors fell in, the photography fell in and the story clicked. I caught a lot of breaks!" ...|$|E
500|$|In one of {{his first}} interviews, Cobain told Sounds {{journalist}} John Robb, [...] "When I write a song the lyrics are the least important thing. I can go through two or three different subjects in a song and the title can mean absolutely nothing at all. Sometimes <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> things harder for myself, just to try to make myself a bit more angry. I try out a few subconscious things I suppose, like conflicts with other people. Most of the lyrics on the Bleach album are about my life in Aberdeen." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{there are}} certain aspects readers can almost always expect in García Márquez's writing, like {{instances}} of humour, he did not stick to any clear and predetermined style template. In an interview with Marlise Simons, García Márquez noted:In every book <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a different path [...] One doesn't choose the style. You can investigate and try to discover what the best style would be for a theme. But the style {{is determined by the}} subject, by the mood of the times. If you try to use something that is not suitable, it just won't work. Then the critics build theories around that and they see things I hadn't seen. I only respond to our way of life, the life of the Caribbean.|$|E

5000|$|I {{particularly}} {{changed the}} nature of the relationship between Clara and Drosselmeyer. In the ballet, he's a mischievous sort of dirty old man, always playing tricks on people. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him a kind of anti-social guy with no family who is obsessed with making toys. His only relationship is with this little girl. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him sympathetic.|$|R
500|$|Madonna {{then said}} she was [...] "doing this to {{liberate}} America — free us all of our hang-ups". She told Spin magazine [...] "We live in a very repressed society, and I deal with erotic themes. The point <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> is: Why should we feel ashamed of our sexuality?". Later she revealed that [...] " [...] does not condone unsafe sexual practices". Nicholas Callaway from Callaway Arts & Entertainment said that the book [...] was [...] "inevitably going to be controversial. The book explores every aspect of sexual fantasy. It's hard to calculate the effect, , Sex should be considered 'art'". Originally it was rumored that Time Warner was nervous about {{the release of the}} book; however, in an interview with Vanity Fair, William Sarnoff, president of Warner Books, said he felt that Madonna [...] "should pursue all avenues of creativity as she defines it". The Warner company had also previously assured that they would make sure Sex reached its main target audience and also reminded that the book was safely wrapped in a Mylar bag to prevent in-store peeping and contained a warning label. Michael Kilian of the Chicago Tribune published an article on October 7, 1992, regarding the then upcoming release of Sex: [...] "Prepare thyself, , The mega-event of the millennium is to occur in precisely two weeks. It's an event far more mega than the November election, the collapse of communism or even the crowning of Leanza Cornett as the new Miss America." [...] Kilian also described it as the [...] "personal sexual fantasy picture book in all Christendom, then it goes far beyond all previous 'truly twisted' personal sexual fantasy picture books—perhaps beyond all imagining what such a book could be".|$|E
2500|$|Nina was {{a singing}} {{champion}} on Tanghalan ng Kampeon, with her winning pieces [...] "Better Days" [...] and [...] "Love Takes Time". She expressed {{having so much}} sacrifices for her singing career, stating [...] "I always order Halo-halo without ice. If I want to eat ice cream, I have to let it melt first or else microwave it. I also don’t eat spicy food or mint candies." [...] She explained, [...] "Of course, {{it was hard for}} me [...] But you get used to it." [...] She also sings twenty songs a day for practice. She takes good care of her voice and maintains a healthy diet, and swore it takes her only three days or less to recover from throat infections. In her 2011 documentary on TvN Asia, it was revealed that despite all the fame and success, Nina still regularly comes back to the Center for Pop Music to train her vocals and make it even stronger. She is also known for doing covers of popular hits. She expressed herself in a statement, saying [...] "I can say that the songs I sing in my albums very much represent who I am [...] <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it my own even if it was done originally by another artist." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Not quite," [...] he answered. [...] "I'll {{confess that}} I'm not {{satisfied}} yet, but <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{the most of}} the good things that come along--and I'm glad I got up early. It's a glorious morning!" ...|$|E

6000|$|My amiable intentions, however, were frustrated; for, when I approached, with as Christian an {{expression}} as my principles would allow, {{and asked the}} question--"Shall <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> you more comfortable, sir?"

6000|$|... 'No, but really--here, old feller; you!' This was the gentleman's way of {{appealing}} to Edward Dorrit, Esquire, on whom he pounced {{as a great}} and providential relief. 'Let you and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> this all right. Lady so very much wishes no Row.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, sometimes. When I {{am pleased}} or frightened I have made little cries. But {{it is only}} when I am not {{thinking}} of it at all that I can do that. If <b>I</b> <b>TRY</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> a sound I cannot do it at all." ...|$|E

6000|$|Randal {{passed this}} over without notice. [...] "Be so good," [...] he said, [...] "as to tell Catherine that <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> every {{possible}} allowance for her, but that I cannot consent {{to sit at}} her dinner-table, and that I dare not face my poor little niece, after what I have heard." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' {{said the}} other, 'I know it isn't. I admit it. Still, let you and <b>I</b> <b>try</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> it all right, and avoid Row.

60|$|I {{thought he}} {{was no more than}} summing up his catastrophes so as to get violent with good excuse, as men will do, and <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> him {{understand}} such things was trifles.|$|R
60|$|I did all I could <b>to</b> <b>make</b> {{her like}} me. I did feel {{rather like a}} usurper, you know. <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> her see that I didn't at all want to put on airs.|$|R
60|$|I {{began to}} pity him profoundly. And {{in a tone}} which <b>I</b> <b>tried</b> <b>to</b> <b>make</b> as little sarcastic as {{possible}} I said that I was glad he had found something to occupy his morning hours.|$|R
