50|$|The {{system was}} mainly used for {{key-to-disk}} operations {{to replace the}} previously popular IBM card punches and more advanced <b>key-to-tape</b> systems manufactured for example by Mohawk Data Sciences (MDS) or Singer. In addition to the basic key-to-disk function, the proprietary operating system, called XLOS, supported indexed file operations for on-line transaction processing even with data journaling. The system was programmed in two different ways. The data entry was either described in several tables that specified {{the format of the}} input record with optional automatic data validation procedures or the indexed file operations were programmed in a special COBOL dialect with IDX and SEQ file support.|$|E
50|$|In many data {{processing}} applications, the punched cards were verified by keying {{exactly the same}} data a second time, {{checking to see if}} the second keying and the punched data were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for keypunch operators, usually women, who worked full-time on keypunch and verifier machines, often in large keypunch departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input. In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals {{led to the development of}} additional <b>key-to-tape</b> and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.|$|E
