40|$|Abstract: In 1948, a {{schizophrenic}} woman {{admitted to}} the Eastern State Hospital in Knoxville, Tennessee, began shredding rags into coloured thread and begging hospital staff {{to give her a}} sewing needle. In the space of seven years, she created several garments, densely embroidered with images and glossolalic text. Ward notes dismissively summarized, “She sews without purpose…is non-productive”. In 1955 she was medicated with the newly developed drug, chlorpromazine, and stopped sewing. Over the years, most of the works were lost – – along with the medical records of their creator, who is known by the pseudonym, “Myrllen”. Today, only two artifacts remain: a scarf, which hangs in Lakeshore Mental Health Center in Knoxville; and a coat, preserved in the Tennessee State Museum. My research is the first academic study of these artifacts, which are virtually unknown outside of Tennessee and Maryland.

All of the panels exhibit Alice drawn {{older than she}} was at the creation of these sketches, as she was eleven at the time. She is sitting in a chair on a top floor while William is in a room below her. William is seen <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>an</b> instrument as he is serenading his sister in the first panel. He stands more erect in the next two panels. William is wearing a large head feather in each of the panels which progressively gets closer to the ceiling until it is pushing against it in the final panel. Growing from the outside of the building is a full bush in the first panel. The bush in the second panel is almost completely devoid of leaves and in the third panel, it is no longer there. The walls of the building shrink throughout the panels until they are almost nonexistent in the final panel. It has been argued that this triptych is a visual representation of a defloration fantasy.|$|R

Onset of pain is commonly related to activity that would stress the low back such as lifting heavy objects.

However, many years of active, manual work involving a lot of movement, such as postman and café owner, had caused him severe joint problems, as had the cumulative effect of long hours <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> heavy old manual typewriter in cold, draughty barracks, and a yo-yo weight problem caused by an underlying medical condition.|$|E

50|$|In one building, {{they come}} across a ratlike being <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> Martian book. Tweel angrily chases the rat-thing away and replaces the book on a shelf, though the Earthmen are not sure whether the rat-thing was reading the book or eating it. Elsewhere in the building, {{which seems to be}} a library, Tweel shows the Earthmen a huge mural of a human {{kneeling}} before a seated Martian. When Leroy remarks that the Martian in the mural looks like the Egyptian god Thoth, Tweel excitedly repeats the name, pointing to itself and all around them at the city. The Earthmen realize that Tweel's people, the Thoth, had visited ancient Egypt and served as inspiration for the Ibis-headed god. (This is actually anachronistic, since Thoth was the classical Greek version of the god's name.)Over the next three days, Tweel shows the Earthmen around the city, including a solar-powered pumping station designed to move water down the canal. Finally, a mile south of the ancient Martian city, the Earthmen find a valley filled with dream-beasts. As the dream-beasts mesmerize them, the two Earthmen see everything they have ever desired spread out before them, and rush forward helplessly. Tweel attacks one of the dream-beasts, momentarily freeing Jarvis. The Earthman kills the dream-beast with a pistol shot, then kills another that is attacking Leroy, and the three of them flee the valley. Jarvis and Leroy return to their rocket to recover from their encounter with the dream-beasts.|$|E
5000|$|Józef Wittlin, in {{his essay}} My Lwów {{described}} him in the following words: Ostap Ortwin was not a Count but it's {{hard to imagine a}} person with a more aristocratic soul and bearing... he discovered Staff and made it possible for Stanisław Brzozowski to become famous and more importantly, to be understood. He was an excellent critic although he often didn't feel like writing, mostly because he spend all his time reading. He read everything, from Spengler to Bend to even all the introductory articles in all the daily papers. He usually expressed his opinions through loud yelling, which shook the large windows at the Cafe Roma where he spent his non-working hours ... He took every undertaking with the utmost seriousness {{while at the same time}} he laughed at everyone and himself, in a way that only Olympic Gods could laugh. Ortwin, the last president of the Lwów Literary Club, was probably the only Polish writer of Jewish ethnicity before whom retreated in reverence all the antisemitic idiots. It seemed that in general he was untouchable. Tall, wide shouldered, grey haired, with thick eyebrows and a black Cossack style mustache he presented himself in a way that paralyzed all kinds of scumbags. He argued with and insulted policemen who asked him for identification after he woke up people of Lwów by loudly threatening futurism. Insulted policemen saluted him as if he were their captain ... in 1942 it turned out that Ortwin was not untouchable. The Germans chased that great, trouble making, soul out of his aristocratic body ... If in the after life there are cafes, then without doubt in one of them there now sits Ostap Ortwin, <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> pile of newspapers ... and he laughs loudly from behind them, and he reads and he reads and he yells and he laughs at us all until the heavens themselves start to shake" [...] Józef Wittlin ...|$|E
40|$|Blood {{pressure}} (BP) measurement {{is one of}} the mostcommon {{procedures that}} clinicians perform. Ideally, a trained health care professional using a validated, calibrated device with an appropriately sized cuff should measure BP in a patient who has rested in a seated position for at least 5 minutes with his or her feet on the floor and back supported (1). The clinician then diagnoses hypertension or assesses BP control after considering the most recent BP in the context of measurements from previous visits. Yet, deviations from these standards are extraordinarily common (2). In practice, BP measurement is remarkably casual. As clinicians and patients, we have personally observed major deviations from accepted standards: Cuffs are applied over clothing, BPs are obtained without allowing the patient to rest for 5 minutes, and measurements are taken while the patient sits <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> on <b>an</b> examination table with hi...|$|R

40|$|The {{works in}} Act/React create an {{impression}} of sociability through interactivity. In our encounters with other people, {{we take for granted}} the premise that social interaction involves autonomous beings who are aware of each other. Yet when the other is a machine, this autonomy and awareness exist primarily {{in the mind of the}} human: the sociability is subjective and the transparency or opaqueness of this illusion is a central element in the machine’s design. This essay concerns the nature of this form of sociability in relation to art, public space, and technology. As human beings, we interact with one another through many modalities: gaze, touch, gesture, and speech. In our daily experience with laptops and desktops– – e-mail checking, Web surfing, and game playing––touch and text are our main communication channels. When the interface grows in scale to become something approached from a distance rather than <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> at <b>a</b> desk, and especially when it moves from office to gallery, the channel changes. Large interactive art installations often use vision, albeit a primitive version of that acute human sense, as their main input modality.

50|$|The {{aardwolf}} feeds {{primarily on}} termites {{and more specifically}} on Trinervitermes. This genus of termites has different species throughout the aardwolf's range. In East Africa, they eat T. bettonianus, and in central Africa, they eat T. rhodesiensis, and finally in southern Africa, they eat T. trinervoides. Their technique consists of licking them off the ground {{as opposed to the}} aardvark, which digs into the mound. They locate their food by sound and also from the scent secreted by the soldier termites. An aardwolf may consume up to 250,000 termites per night using its sticky, long tongue. They do not destroy the termite mound or consume the entire colony, thus ensuring that the termites can rebuild and provide a continuous supply of food. They often memorize the location of such nests and return to them every few months. During certain seasonal events, such as the onset of the rainy season and the cold of midwinter, the primary termites become scarce, so the need for other foods becomes pronounced. During these times, the southern aardwolf will seek out Hodotermes mossambicus, a type of harvester termite active in the afternoon, which explains some of their diurnal behavior in the winter. The eastern aardwolf, during the rainy season, subsists on termites from the genera Odontotermes and Macrotermes. They are also known to feed on other insects, larvae, eggs, and, some sources say, occasionally small mammals and birds, but these constitute {{a very small percentage of}} their total diet. Unlike other hyenas, aardwolves do not scavenge or kill larger animals. Contrary to popular myths, aardwolves do not eat carrion, and if they are seen eating while <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> dead carcass, they are actually eating larvae and beetles. Also, contrary to some sources, they do not like meat, unless it is finely ground or cooked for them. The adult aardwolf was formerly assumed to forage in small groups, but more recent research has shown that they are primarily solitary foragers, necessary because of the scarcity of their insect prey. Their primary source, Trinervitermes, forages in small but dense patches of 25 - 100 cm. While foraging, the aardwolf can cover about 1 km per hour, which translates to 8 - 12 km per summer night and 3 - 8 km per winter night.|$|E
5000|$|A taciturn, white-blonde Virginian bricklayer, and {{the husband}} of Mildred. On the {{character}} of Richard, Nichols stated, [...] "Richard speaks in a clipped manner, then it's the way he holds his head {{in front of the}} rest of the body, how self-conscious he seemed in front of the camera. He'd laugh and quickly cover his lips over his tobacco-stained teeth. He's a bricklayer ... they're hunched over all day long, and they turn their bodies into these assembly lines for laying brick. What I gave Edgerton, in terms of coherent character on the page, he added specificity." [...] When describing Richard, Edgerton stated that he [...] "... was a quiet hero, and sometimes quiet dignity speaks louder than the typical movie hero who's all too eager to fight." [...] He spoke of some of the challenges in portraying Richard, such as the Virginian accent, in which he stated, [...] "The importance of the story itself, not to treat it with kid gloves but to maintain a reverence for the truth, for the responsibility we felt toward these real people. And conveying so much with so few words was one of the biggest challenges." [...] To capture the physical quality of Richard, Edgerton bleached his hair, adopted a receding hairline, and wore prosthetic teeth. He spoke of the influences in Errol Morris' The Thin Blue Line (1988), recommended by Nichols, which assisted in his finding of Richard's accent. He was drawn to Nichols' version of the character, as according to him he was: [...] "just shut down and emasculated and weathered by this situation" [...] while Edgerton noted the version was keeping more in line with the man in Buirski's The Loving Story (2011). Both Nichols and Edgerton felt the main challenge of bringing Richard to the screen was the question of where he fell on the intellectual spectrum, as Richard was not well educated nor naturally gifted, and may not have understood the case's complexities or its social ramifications, with both actor and director holding conversations on the subject. Edgerton spoke of Richard, the difficulty in holding an accent with a taciturn approach, while referring to roles of the past: [...] "With a character like John Connolly of Black Mass (2015), you really get to fly on the rhythm of an accent, and the rhythm is so much a part of what an accent is. When you don’t have much to say, it’s hard to latch onto that cadence." [...] Edgerton also involved himself in bricklaying to prepare for the role, and while speaking of his experience he remarked that he began to fully understood Richard's posture: [...] "Suddenly it made sense because of the mechanics of his work ... Here was a man who looked awkward in his own body because he was so used to conserving energy. A man who slumped because he spent his days <b>hunched</b> <b>over</b> <b>a</b> pile of bricks." [...] In an interview with People, Edgerton spoke of Richard and Mildred's daughter Peggy: [...] "Peggy is as shy as her father and we were really just hoping for her acceptance and her blessing, which I think we got. One day on set she called me ‘Daddy’ and it was like the greatest blessing I’ve ever had." ...|$|E

My own personal research into the American author/propagandist, admittedly originally inspired by Hunter S. Thompson, led me to a cultural/rhetorical investigation of Eastern and Western poetry. I set out with the naive intention of analyzing pieces of poetry from different cultures and performing an analysis of the rhetorical devices employed by the authors. Realizing the staggeringly ambiguous nature of this query, I then sought to narrow my focus and settle on those works that were written directly before, during, or after periods of social/political instability, more specifically revolution, occupation, civil war, etc. With this common denominator, I analyzed the rhetorical devices employed by the authors and discovered some surprising similarities between the pieces, as I expected that, because of the different attitudes towards rhetoric in “Eastern ” and “Western ” cultures, the device...|$|R
