500|$|One notable {{advocate}} for the fledgling movement was Mark Twain. Manipulative treatments had purportedly alleviated the symptoms of his daughter Jean's epilepsy as well as Twain's own chronic bronchitis. In 1909, he spoke before the New York State Assembly at a hearing regarding the practice of osteopathy in the state. [...] "I don't know as I cared much about these osteopaths until <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> were going to drive {{them out of the}} state, but since I heard that I haven't been able to sleep." [...] Philosophically opposed to the American Medical Association's stance that its own type of medical practice was the only legitimate one, he spoke in favor of licensing for osteopaths. Physicians from the New York County Medical Society responded with a vigorous attack on Twain, who retorted with [...] "he physicians think they are moved by regard for {{the best interests of the}} public. Isn't there a little touch of self-interest back of it all?" [...] "...The objection is, people are curing people without a license and you are afraid it will bust up business." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the book, <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>You</b> Paint Houses: Frank [...] "The Irishman" [...] Sheeran and the Closing of the Case on Jimmy Hoffa (2004), author Charles Brandt {{claims that}} Sheeran, a {{professional}} killer for the mob and {{longtime friend of}} Hoffa's, confessed to assassinating Hoffa. According to Brandt, Chuckie O'Brien drove Sheeran, Hoffa, and fellow mobster Sal Briguglio to a house in Detroit. He claimed that while O'Brien and Briguglio drove off, Sheeran and Hoffa went into the house, where Sheeran claims that he shot Hoffa twice behind the right ear. Sheeran says that {{he was told that}} Hoffa was cremated after the murder. Sheeran also confessed to reporters that he murdered Hoffa. [...] Blood found in the Detroit house where Sheeran claimed the murder happened was determined not to be Hoffa's.|$|E

2500|$|In 1969 {{the group}} {{began to make}} the first of their {{unreleased}} tapes. Rumors have surfaced of two (of perhaps hundreds) unreleased reel-to-reel items titled Rusty Coathangers for the Doctor and The Ballad of Stuffed Trigger. The actual titles are in question (as is the notion that these were album-length recordings), but the first title has been confirmed by a former head of the now defunct Smelly Tongues fan club. Further evidence of pre-1970 recordings surfaced with the release of the song <b>I</b> <b>Heard</b> <b>You</b> Got Religion, supposedly recorded in 1969, and released originally as a downloadable track from Ralph America in 1999. Cryptic says there are lots of tapes dating back decades, but they were all recorded before the group had officially become [...] "The Residents" [...] so the band does not consider them to be part of its discography.|$|E
2500|$|Zhou Yu {{personally}} welcomed Jiang Gan {{and told}} him, [...] "Ziyi, you tried hard. You travelled {{all the way}} here just to be {{a spokesman for the}} Caos?" [...] Jiang Gan replied, [...] "I'm an old friend of yours but we've not been in contact for years. When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> have become famous now, I travelled here to visit you and reminisce our past days, as well as to tour the region. Are you suspecting my intentions when you called me a 'spokesman'?" [...] Zhou Yu said, [...] "I may not be as good as the musicians of ancient times, but I still know how to appreciate a beautiful piece of music." [...] Zhou Yu then invited Jiang Gan to dine with him. After the meal, before he left, Zhou Yu told Jiang Gan, [...] "I've something confidential to attend to, and I need to leave now. I'll treat you to another meal again after I'm done with that." ...|$|E
2500|$|George Bales, a {{stage hand}} at Fox Theater gave Jerry Garcia Heil's phone number, and Heil remembers Garcia calling to say [...] "Hey man, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> {{have a really}} big PA." [...] Heil had been toying and {{tinkering}} with the large speakers that the Fox had replaced months earlier with a new system. [...] Heil, {{one of the two}} organists at the Mighty Wurlitzer in the Fox (dating back to 1956) was given their old speakers which Heil built into his new sound system using the massive Altec Lansing A-4 speaker cabinets. Heil replaced the 15-inch speakers with JBL D140s, and added an array of four radial horns and ring tweeters all driven by McIntosh amplifiers. He has stated [...] "That made a huge difference. It was like a big 'hi-fi' system. Except for Bill Hanley of Hanley Sound (Medford, MA) no one was putting radial horns into PA systems; they were just doing speakers in columns, like the Vocalmaster. The horns are what give the system intelligibility — you can actually understand the lyrics." [...] His stack riggings resulted in an unusual frequency range from below 200Hz to well over 15kHz.|$|E

2500|$|The New York Post {{wrote that}} the lyrics [...] "express {{emotions}} ranging from the flip to the resigned". Sharan Shetty of Slate stated that the song is about [...] "heartbreak and redemption", while a Yahoo! News reviewer noted that it is about [...] "personal travails and confusion". Nora Crotty of Elle magazine described the single as an [...] "ode to repenting {{in the morning for}} the foolish mistakes you made the night before". Billboards Vena stated that a [...] "plucky acoustic guitar" [...] accompanies Rihanna's vocals while she sings the lines, [...] "I think I've had enough/ Might get a little drunk/ I say what's on my mind/ I might do a little time. Cause all of my kindness/ Is taken for weakness." [...] After the first chorus West sings, [...] "Woke up an optimist/ Sun was shining, I'm positive/ Then <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>you</b> was talking trash/ Hold me back/ I'm about to spazz." [...] On the second chorus, he and Rihanna harmonize as they sing, [...] "Now I'm four, five seconds from wildin'/ And we got three more days 'till Friday/ I'm just trying to make it back home by Monday morning." [...] McCartney's voice can be heard sped up underneath West's opening vocals. McCartney originally played his guitar part slower and in a lower key, which West later speeded up for the finished release, thus causing McCartney's voice to sound much higher than its normal tone. McCartney's lyrics were improvised mid-performance and are for the most part drowned out by West's vocals except for the lines [...] "We can run around" [...] and [...] "How 'bout a mystery" ...|$|E
