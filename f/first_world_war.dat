Allingham also marched past the Cenotaph on Remembrance Sunday in 2005 and laid wreaths at memorials in Saint-Omer on Armistice Day. That {{was the last time}} a <b>First</b> <b>World</b> <b>War</b> veteran marched past the Cenotaph and it marked the end of an era.

50|$|Older pump-action {{shotguns}} {{are often}} faster than modern semi-automatic shotguns, {{as they often}} {{did not have a}} trigger disconnector, and were capable of firing a new round as fast as the pump action was cycled, with the trigger held down continuously.
