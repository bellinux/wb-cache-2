[...] You signed that paper, knowing only what the interpreter told you it said. If anything happened when the paper was being made up that changed its order, if you had been educated and could read and write, you could have known about it and refused to put your name on it. <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>intend</b> to let your children remain in the same condition of ignorance in which you have lived, which will compel them always to meet the whiter man at a great disadvantage through an interpreter, as you have to do? [...] As your friend, Spotted Tail, I urge you to send your children with me to this Carlisle School and I will do everything I can to advance them in intelligence and industry in order that they may come back and help you." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't suppose <b>you</b> <b>did.</b> But {{never mind}} me. What I {{want to know}} is, <b>do</b> <b>you</b> fellows <b>intend</b> to smash all the glass in those hotbed frames out yonder?" ...|$|R

[...] The defending counsel, Aubrey Melford Stevenson, supported by Sebag Shaw and Peter Rawlinson, would have advised Ellis of this possible question before the trial began, because it is standard legal practice to do so.
