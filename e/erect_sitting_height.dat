40|$|As {{pediatric}} PMHS {{data are}} extremely limited, evidence of kinematic differences between pediatric ATDs and live humans comes from comparison of laboratory data to field crash data. Despite {{the existence of}} regulations intended to prevent head injuries, these remain the most common serious injuries sustained by children in crashes. In this study, nine frontal sled tests using a Hybrid III 6 YO and three tests performed with a child-size adult PMHS were compared, with focus on the kinematic responses (especially of the head) and the seatbelt forces generated during the impact. Two different restraint systems (a pretensioning, force-limiting seatbelt, and a non pretensioning force-limiting standard belt) and two different impact speeds (29 km/h and 48 km/h) were compared. Data from the PMHS were scaled using the <b>erect</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> of a 50 th percentile 6 YO and both scaled and unscaled data are presented. The ATD predicted correctly the peak values of the scaled displacements of the PMHS, but differences in relevant parameters such as torso angle and resultant acceleration at different locations {{were found between the}} dummy and the PMHS. The ATD’s stiffer thoracic spine is hypothesized as a major cause of these differences...|$|E

Target stature, body mass, and <b>erect</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> were established by reference to the median values for these dimensions in a recent Army study. Body landmark locations from 100 soldiers {{with a wide range}} of body size obtained in a single squad seating condition were analyzed using regression methods to establish target surface landmark and internal joint center locations. Laser scan data from 126 men in up to four seated postures were analyzed using principal component analysis and regression to obtain a statistical model predicting body shape as a function of overall body dimensions and surface landmark locations. A subset of the target landmarks obtained in the squad posture analysis were used as input to the body shape model, resulting in a three-dimensional representation of the mean expected body shape for soldiers matching the target body dimensions in the reference seating condition. Small adjustments to the posture and shape were made to obtain a symmetrical posture with the thighs horizontal and legs vertical.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} whether the differences in timing of the peak growth velocity (PGV) between <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> total body height, subischial leg length, and foot length can be used to predict whether the individual patient with adolescent idiopathic scoliosis is before or past his or her PGV of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Furthermore, ratios of growth of different body parts were considered in order to determine their value in prediction of the PGV of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> in the individual patient. Ages of the PGV were determined for <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (n = 360), total body height (n = 432), subischial leg length (n = 357), and foot length (n = 263), and compared for the whole group and for the individual child in particular.

The mean ages of the PGV all differed significantly from the mean age of the PGV of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> However, the variation over individual children of the age differences in PGV between body dimensions was large, and the differences in timing of the PGV were not useful to predict whether the individual child is before or past his or her PGV of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> © 2010 The Author(s) ...|$|R
40|$|Associations {{of breast}} cancer overall with {{indicators}} of exposures during puberty are reasonably well characterized; however, uncertainty remains regarding the associations of <b>height,</b> leg length, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and menarcheal age with hormone receptor-defined malignancies. Within the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition cohort, Cox proportional hazards models were {{used to describe the}} relationships of adult height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and age at menarche with risk of estrogen and progesterone receptor negative (ER-PR-) (n = 990) and ER+PR+ (n = 3, 524) breast tumors. Height as a single risk factor was compared to a model combining leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The possible interactions of height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> with menarche were also analyzed. Risk of both ER-PR- and ER+PR+ malignancies was positively associated with standing height, leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and inversely associated with increasing age at menarche. For ER+PR+ disease, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (hazard ratios: 1. 14 [95 % confidence interval: 1. 08 – 1. 20]) had a stronger risk association than leg length (1. 05 [1. 00 – 1. 11]). In comparison, for ER-PR- disease, no distinct differences were observed between leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Women who were tall and had an early menarche (= 13 years) showed an almost twofold increase in risk of ER+PR+ tumors but no such increase in risk was observed for ER-PR- disease. Indicators of exposures during rapid growth periods were associated with risks of both HR-defined breast cancers. Exposures during childhood promoting faster development may establish risk associations for both HR-positive and -negative malignancies. The stronger associations of the components of height with ER+PR+ tumors among older women suggest possible hormonal links that could be specific for postmenopausal women...|$|R
40|$|Objectives The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{correlate}} <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> measured by stadiometry with lumbar spine height (LSH) modifications measured by musculoskeletal ultrasonography (MSU). Methods Eighteen healthy young adults were recruited for this study (mean age: 21. 5 ± 1. 5 years). All subjects were tested in the following sequence: (1) lying supine for 10 minutes, (2) sitting under loaded (9. 5 kg) and unloaded conditions for 5 minutes each, (3) lying supine for 15 minutes with passive lumbar extension, and (4) sitting unloaded for 5 minutes. Both stadiometry and MSU measurements were taken after each step of the testing sequence. Results Following the loaded <b>sitting</b> step, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (measured by stadiometry) decreased by 3. 4 ± 1. 6 mm, whereas following sustained lumbar extension, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> increased by 5. 4 ± 3. 5 mm (P. 05).

40|$|BACKGROUND: Tallness has {{consistently}} {{been associated with}} an increased risk of breast cancer. We investigated the association further by decomposing height into leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> METHODS: From the prospective Danish cohort ‘Diet, Cancer and Health’, 23 864 postmenopausal women enrolled during 1993 – 1997 were followed for a diagnosis of breast cancer in the Danish Cancer Registry through 2009. RESULTS: The incidence rate ratios for breast cancer were 1. 11 (95 % CI 1. 06 – 1. 16) for each 5 cm increase in total height and 1. 09 (95 % CI 1. 01 – 1. 17) and 1. 14 (95 % CI 1. 04 – 1. 25) for each 5 cm increase in leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> respectively. There was no statistical significant difference between the associations for leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (P 0. 47).

40|$|Objectives: Leg {{length and}} {{relative}} leg length {{are considered to}} be reliable markers of prepubertal living conditions. Cessation of leg growth, driven by estrogen, occurs earlier in puberty in girls than boys. We hypothesized that leg length and relative leg length, as <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio, might have sex-specific associations with age of puberty. Methods: We used multivariable linear regression in 10, 046 older (≥ 50 years) Chinese from the Guangzhou Biobank Cohort Study (Phase 3) to examine the associations of recalled age of puberty (women: age of menarche, and men: mean age of first nocturnal emission, voice breaking, and first pubic hair) with subischeal leg length, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Results: Leg length and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio had different associations with age of puberty in men and women (P-values for interaction < 0. 001), but <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> did not. Per year earlier puberty, legs were longer among men by 0. 09 cm (95 % confidence interval (CI) 0. 01 - 0. 18) and shorter among women by 20. 16 cm (95 % CI 20. 20 to 20. 12). Further adjustment for age, hip size (as a marker of buttock fat), and several markers of childhood conditions did not obviate the difference in association by sex. Conclusions: Adult leg length and relative leg length (<b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to leg ratio) may be biomarkers of different exposures in men and women, with corresponding implications for their interpretation as a biomarker of early life exposures. © 2010 Wiley-Liss, Inc. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background Knowing {{the timing}} of the pubertal growth spurt of the spine, {{represented}} by <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> is essential for the prognosis and therapy of adolescent idiopathic scoliosis. There are several indicators that reflect growth or remaining growth of the patient. For example, distal body parts have their growth spurt earlier in adolescence, and therefore the growth of the foot can be an early indicator for the growth spurt of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Shoe size is a good alternative for foot length, since patients can remember when they bought new shoes and what size these shoes were. Therefore the clinician already has access to some longitudinal data at the first visit of the patient to the outpatient clinic. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the increase in shoe size during adolescence and to determine whether {{the timing of}} the peak increase could be an early indicator for {{the timing of the}} peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Methods Data concerning shoe sizes of girls and boys were acquired from two large shoe shops from 1991 to 2008. The longitudinal series of 242 girls and 104 boys were analysed for the age of the "peak increase" in shoe size, as well as the age of cessation of foot growth based on shoe size. Results The average peak increase in shoe size occurred at 10. 4 years (SD 1. 1) in girls and 11. 5 years (SD 1. 5) in boys. This was on average 1. 3 years earlier than the average peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> in girls, and 2. 5 years earlier in boys. The increase in shoe size diminishes when the average peak growth velocity of <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> takes place at respectively 12. 0 (SD 0. 8) years in girls, and 13. 7 (SD 1. 0) years in boys. Conclusions Present data suggest that the course of the shoe size of children visiting the outpatient clinic can be a useful first tool for predicting the timing of the pubertal growth spurt of <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> as a representative for spinal length.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} a pilot {{experimental}} study aimed at a first evaluation of the introduction of an articulation in {{the upper part of}} the seat backrest. The idea of introducing this articulation sprang from prevention of whiplash injuries and this study tentatively assesses its potential for improvement in comfort. This was done considering a pre-defined articulation height. A height for the articulation of 43. 5 cm above the H-point of a reference seat was theoretically deduced based on a population with an average <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> of 88 cm. Participants evaluated the articulated seat in comparison with the reference seat. Twelve participants were divided into three groups of <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> In a laboratory environment subjective comfort evaluations and preferred values of deployment of the articulation and of counter-tilting of the headrest were registered. Driving on the roads completed and validated the laboratory assessments. The reference seat was deemed less comfortable for the participants with short and medium <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> than for the tall ones. There was a notable improvement in comfort for most of the medium and short <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> participants when using the articulated seat.

40|$|Aim In an anthropometric assessment, {{elderly are}} {{frequently}} unable to measure their height due to mobility and skeletal deformities. An {{alternative is to}} use a surrogate value of stature from arm span, knee <b>height,</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The equations developed for predicting height in Indonesian elderly using these three predictors. The equations put in the nutritional assessment card (NSA) of older people. Before the card which is the first new technology in Indonesia will be applied in the community, it should be tested. The study aimed was to conduct diagnostic test of predicted height model in the card compared to actual height. Methods Model validation towards 400 healthy elderly conducted in Jakarta City with cross-sectional design. The study was the second validation test of the model besides Depok City representing semi urban area which was undertaken as the first study. Result Male elderly had higher mean age, height, weight, arm span, knee <b>height,</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> as compared to female elderly. The highest correlation between knee height and standing height was similar in women (r = 0. 80; P < 0. 001) and men (r = 0. 78; P < 0. 001), and followed by arm span and <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Knee height had the lowest difference with standing height in men (3. 13 cm) and women (2. 79 cm). Knee height had the biggest sensitivity (92. 2 %), and the highest specificity on <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (91. 2 %).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Three {{questions}} were addressed: (1) Do female gymnasts have adolescent growth spurts in <b>height,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> and leg length? (2) Are the sequence {{and magnitude of}} spurts comparable with female adolescent non-athletes? (3) How do the data compare with other female gymnasts and with short girls? STUDY DESIGN: <b>Height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> were measured annually on 15 Belgian gymnasts from 8. 7 +/- 1. 5 to 15. 5 +/- 1. 5 years. The gymnasts trained, on average, approximately 15 h/wk. Leg length was estimated as <b>height</b> minus <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> The Preece-Baines Model I was fitted to individual growth records to estimate ages at peak velocity and peak velocities for the three dimensions. Age at menarche and skeletal age were also assessed. RESULTS: Gymnasts have clearly defined adolescent spurts in height, estimated leg length, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> that occur approximately 1 year later and are slightly less intense than in nonathletic adolescent girls. Age at menarche and skeletal age are consistent with later somatic maturation. The pattern of adolescent growth and maturation {{is similar to that}} of other gymnasts, short normal late-maturing girls, and late-maturing girls with short parents.

40|$|This {{paper is}} closed access. Background: We analyse the NHANES III sample {{to assess the}} {{suitability}} of measured stature and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> to estimate leg length (tibia + femur) and predict fatness. High rates of overweight in the United States population may lead to greater gluteo-femoral fat mass which will increase <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and artificially decrease estimates of both absolute and relative leg length. Methods: The analyses include 3076 women and 3233 men, 20. 0 - 49. 9 years of age of White, Black or Mexican-American ethnicity. The poverty index ratio, measured stature, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> upper leg length, weight, four skinfolds, buttocks circumference and elbow, biacromial and biiliac breadths were extracted from the database. The <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio, % body fatness, % upper leg length (ULL/stature), and other indices were estimated. Correlation and principle component analysis {{were used to assess}} the relationship between measures of body fatness, relative leg length and the other variables. Results: For adults in the NHANES III %body fat is more strongly correlated with buttocks circumference (r = 0. 87 and 0. 78 for women and men), than with any measure of estimated leg length (r's range from - 0. 28 to - 0. 10 for both sexes). Principle components analysis separates fatness, stature and estimated leg length into uncorrelated factors for this sample. Conclusion: Reports of a negative association between leg length and fatness for adults of the NHANES III are likely spurious, due to greater gluteo-femoral fat thickness increasing <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Future rounds of the NHANES, and similar surveys in other nations with high body fat populations, should measure lower extremity length directly to better assess its relationship to health and disease risk. © The Author 2008; all rights reserved...|$|R

Four traits of linear dimensionality (stature, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm and leg lengths) were studied in the age span of 3 to 18 years. A significant average annual increase of all four anthropometric parameters were observed up to 14 and 15 years of age in girls and 16 years of age in boys, showing that girls had a shorter growing period. In the prepubertal period until 9 years of age, gender differences were negligible. At the age of 10, boys were overgrown by girls in all parameters due to the earlier onset of puberty in girls.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to describe the relationship between the level of flexibility (sit-and-reach test) and relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (<b>sitting</b> height/body <b>height</b> ratio). The survey was conducted between 2011 - 13 in 1370 individuals (739 women and 631 men) divided into 6 age groups: 18 - 29 (n= 451), 30 - 39 (n= 310), 40 - 49 (n= 248), 50 - 59 (n= 147) 60 - 69 (n= 164) and 70 + years (n= 50). Flexibility was measured using the sit-andreach test, according to the methodology of Eurofit (3 attempts, only the best one was recorded). The values of relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> were computed from the ratio between <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and total body height. he results showed that there is a significant correlation between the examined variables (r = 0. 213), i. e. a proportionally longer trunk and shorter legs may {{have an impact on the}} result of sit-and-reach test, but the correlation is low (r 2 = 0. 045). This finding indicated that the result in the sit-and-reach test can be influenced by more factors than only by pure flexibility.

40|$|Objectives This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} changes and interrelationships between changes in selected anthropometric growth parameters and motor and physical fitness, among boys over a 2 year period during mid-adolescence. Methods Speed, agility, hand-eye coordination, explosive power, muscle strength, and aerobic endurance were measured once a year, and the anthropometric measurements (stature, body mass, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> arm span, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio), were measured {{three times per}} year, 4 months apart (among 73 adolescent boys). A hierarchical linear model, adjusting for covariates and partial correlation analysis (R 2) were {{used to analyze the}} data. Results All anthropometric, motor, and physical measurements improved significantly over the two-year period. Significantly, greater changes were seen between 13 and 14 years in stature, arm span, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and body mass. Changes in muscle strength, speed and agility were mainly significant between 13 and 14 years while the biggest changes occurred in explosive power and upper-body-arm-and-shoulder-strength during year 2 (14 – 15 years). The majority of interrelationships, indicating moderate to small relationships, were found between changes in stature, arm span, and <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> and changing strength, speed, agility, and hand eye coordination over the two-year period, after adjusting for maturity age and physical activity levels. Conclusion Motor and physical fitness improved significantly from 13 to 15 years, showing definite interrelationships with anthropometric growth during the mid-adolescence period. Awareness and education about these changes are recommended as it can have significant effects on the sport performance and fitness training of boys during mid-adolescence. Am. J. Hum.

40|$|The {{relationship}} between vowel formants {{and the second}} subglottal resonance (Sg 2) has previously been explored in English, German, Hungarian and Korean. Results from these studies indicate that vowel space is categorically divided by Sg 2 and that Sg 2 correlates well with standing height. One {{of the goals of}} this work is to verify if the above findings hold true in Mandarin as well. The correlation between Sg 2 and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (trunk length) is also studied. Further, since Mandarin is a tonal language (with more pitch variations compared to English), we study the {{relationship between}} Sg 2 and fundamental frequency (F 0). A new corpus of simultaneous recordings of speech and subglottal acoustics was collected from 20 native Mandarin speakers. Results on this corpus indicate that Sg 2 divides vowel space in Mandarin as well, and that it is more correlated with <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> than standing height. Paired t-tests are conducted on the Sg 2 measurements from different vowel parts, which represent different F 0 regions. Preliminary results show that there is no statistically-significant variation of Sg 2 with F 0 within a tone.

Births to Maya immigrant women have created a sizable number of Maya American children. The <b>height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> of 5 to 12 years children (n = 431) were measured in 1999 and 2000. Leg length was estimated and the <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio was calculated. These data were compared with a sample of Maya children living in Guatemala measured in 1998 (n = 1, 347). Maya American children are currently 11. 54 cm taller and 6. 83 cm longer-legged, on average, than Maya children living in Guatemala. Consequently, the Maya Americans have a significantly lower average <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio (i. e., relatively longer legs in proportion to length of the head and trunk) than do the Maya in Guatemala.

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{combination}} chemotherapy and cranial irradiation on final height and body proportions was retrospectively examined in {{a cohort of}} 142 children treated for acute lymphoblastic leukaemia (ALL). Eighty four children (48 girls, 36 boys) received 24 Gy cranial irradiation and 58 (35 girls, 23 boys) 18 Gy. None had received testicular or spinal irradiation. A significant reduction in standing height SD score from diagnosis to final height was seen in all groups. Of the 109 children in whom <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> measurements were available, 88 (81 %) had relatively shorter backs than legs and in 25 (23 %) this disproportion was of a marked degree. After mathematical correction for <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> loss {{there was no longer}} a significant reduction in standing height SD score at final height in all except the 24 Gy group of girls. These data suggest that disproportion is a common finding after treatment for ALL and that, at least in some children, much if not all of the height loss seen is due to a reduction in <b>sitting</b> <b>height.</b> Possible explanations for this disproportion include a disturbance of puberty or an effect of chemotherapy on spinal growth, or both...|$|R
40|$|Adult <b>height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> {{may reflect}} genetic and {{environmental}} factors, including early life nutrition, {{physical and social}} environments. Previous studies have reported divergent associations for height and chronic disease mortality, with positive associations observed for cancer mortality but inverse associations for circulatory disease mortality. Sitting height might be more strongly associated with insulin resistance; however, data on <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and mortality is sparse. Using the European Prospective Investigation into Cancer and Nutrition study, a prospective cohort of 409, 748 individuals, we examined adult <b>height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> in relation to all-cause and cause-specific mortality. Height was measured {{in the majority of}} participants; <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> was measured in ~ 253, 000 participants. During an average of 12. 5 years of follow-up, 29, 810 deaths (11, 931 from cancer and 7, 346 from circulatory disease) were identified. Hazard ratios (HR) with 95 % confidence intervals (CI) for death were calculated using multivariable Cox regression within quintiles of height. Height was positively associated with cancer mortality (men: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 1. 11, 95 %CI = 1. 00 - 1. 24; women: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 1. 17, 95 %CI = 1. 07 - 1. 28). In contrast, height was inversely associated with circulatory disease mortality (men: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 63, 95 %CI = 0. 56 - 0. 71; women: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 81, 95 %CI = 0. 70 - 0. 93). Although <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> was not associated with cancer mortality, it was inversely associated with circulatory disease (men: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 64, 95 %CI = 0. 55 - 0. 75; women: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 60, 95 %CI = 0. 49 - 0. 74) and respiratory disease mortality (men: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 45, 95 %CI = 0. 28 - 0. 71; women: HRQ 5 vs. Q 1 = 0. 60, 95 %CI = 0. 40 - 0. 89).

The samples consist of 579 healthy {{women from the}} province of Cagliari and 138 {{from the town of}} Rieti, aged 20. 0 – 39. 9 years, measured in the period 2003 – 2006. The women were divided into four 5 -year age groups. The anthropometric variables were considered according to different socioeconomic status (SES) in the Cagliari sample, while the Rieti sample was considered as a whole, as the SES was homogeneous. ANOVA results suggest that the secular trend was very slow or had come to a halt in the Rieti sample but continues in the Cagliari sample, as shown by the statistically significant differences for estimated lower limb length (pr 0. 02), and relative <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (pr 0. 05). However, these differences disappear after ANCOVA with sibship size and socioeconomic status controlled for, suggesting that they depend mainly on the composition of the Cagliari sample in terms of SES. Therefore, it can be hypothesised that the secular trend might be very slow or has stopped in the Cagliari subsamples homogeneous for SES...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Decomposing stature {{into its}} major {{components}} {{is proving to}} be a useful strategy to assess the antecedents of disease, morbidity and death in adulthood. Human leg length (femur + tibia), <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> (trunk length + head length) and their proportions, for example, (leg length/stature), or the <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio (<b>sitting</b> height/stature × 100), among others) are associated with epidemiological risk for overweight (fatness), coronary heart disease, diabetes, liver dysfunction and certain cancers. There is also wide support for the use of relative leg length as an indicator {{of the quality of the}} environment for growth during infancy, childhood and the juvenile years of development. Human beings follow a cephalo-caudal gradient of growth, the pattern of growth common to all mammals. A special feature of the human pattern is that between birth and puberty the legs grow relatively faster than other post-cranial body segments. For groups of children and youth, short stature due to relatively short legs (i. e., a high <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> ratio) is generally a marker of an adverse environment. The development of human body proportions is the product of environmental x genomic interactions, although few if any specific genes are known.

40|$|The {{test battery}} {{was unable to}} {{significantly}} discriminate between the two performance levels in any junior male or female age group, although multiple regression analysis yielded significant models for junior males (P= 0. 000) and females (P= 0. 000) accounting for 74 % and 47 % {{of the variance in}} swimming per-formance respectively. In junior males, arm span, waist circum-ference, torso to waist ratio and CMJ were significant predictors of performance (P< 0. 05) and in junior females, arm span, <b>sitting</b> <b>height,</b> <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> percentage and CMJ were significant pre-dictors of performance (P< 0. 05). Several of the characteristics identified as important for junior swimming performance are those that individually differentiate between performance level in senior swimmers (in males, torso to waist ratio and CMJ and in females, <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> and <b>sitting</b> <b>height</b> percentage). Hence, some characteristics possessed by elite junior swimmers may also be important for elite senior swimming performance. All regression analyses were unable to explain 100 % of the vari-ance in swimming performance indicating that some of this vari-ance must be attributed to other factors such as more detailed physiological measures, swimming technique, psychological and/or environmental characteristics. It seems likely that the inclusion of swimming specific tests in the battery would pro-vide additional predictive power to this analysis, although fur-ther multidisciplinary research is required to establish any con-tribution these factors may have to elite swimming performance. CONCLUSION The characteristics that predict swimming performance differ from junior to senior level in both males and females. A longitu-dinal approach to this type of research would provide valuable information about the importance of certain characteristics to performance during growth and development and at senior level. This type of approach suggests that an appropriate multidiscipli-nary test battery combined with multivariate analyses could be useful as an important predictive and diagnostic tool for talent identification and development in elite junior swimmers...|$|R
