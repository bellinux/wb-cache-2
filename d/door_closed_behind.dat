6000|$|Sometimes {{people would}} stay {{long after the}} shop was closed--"They don't mind a bit at Shalford's," [...] these ladies used to say--it is always ladies {{do this sort of}} thing--and while they loitered it was {{forbidden}} to touch a wrapper, or take any measures to conclude the day until the <b>doors</b> <b>closed</b> <b>behind</b> them.|$|R
