5000|$|The moment one {{became a}} student at Victoria College, one was given the student handbook, a series of {{regulations}} governing every aspect of school life—the kind of uniform we were to wear, what equipment was needed for sports, the <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays,</b> bus schedules, and so on. But the school’s first rule, emblazoned on the opening page of the handbook, read: [...] "English {{is the language of}} the school; students caught speaking any other language will be punished." [...] Yet, there were no native speakers of English among the students. Whereas the masters were all British, we were a motley crew of Arabs of various kinds, Armenians, Greeks, Italians, Jews, and Turks, each of whom had a native language that the school had explicitly outlawed. Yet all, or nearly all, of us spoke Arabic—many spoke Arabic and French—and so we were able to take refuge in a common language, in defiance of what we perceived as an unjust colonial structure.

50|$|<b>School</b> <b>holidays</b> (also {{referred}} to as vacations, breaks, and recess) are the periods during which schools are closed. The <b>dates</b> and periods <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> vary considerably throughout the world, and there is usually some variation even within the same jurisdiction. Governments often legislate on the total number <b>of</b> <b>school</b> days for state <b>schools.</b> The <b>holidays</b> given below apply to primary and secondary education. Teaching sessions (terms or semesters) in tertiary education are usually shorter.|$|R
5000|$|In Australia, summer officially lasts from December to February, and {{therefore}} includes Christmas and New Year <b>holidays.</b> The <b>dates</b> <b>of</b> Australian <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> (the term used, rather than [...] "vacation") {{are determined by}} each state's Department of Education, the Christmas summer holiday being the longest in duration. Typically Christmas summer holiday in Australia last approximately six weeks, usually from mid-December (depending on school year, see below) to late January. This is significantly shorter than North American summer <b>holiday,</b> but Australian <b>schools</b> also break for two weeks at Easter, and in June and September, giving students and teachers a total of twelve weeks of annual holidays. In many public schools, years 10 through 12 will finish before December 15, allowing time to complete exam marking and results. Year 10 commonly finishes {{at the end of}} November, Year 11 at the end of October, and year 12 (Senior Year) also at mid or the end of October after 3 weeks of end-of-year exams. This can bring the normal 12 weeks of vacation to 20 weeks of vacation. The intervening periods <b>of</b> <b>school</b> operation without <b>holidays</b> are called [...] "School Terms", each term lasting approximately ten weeks. All Australian states have relatively similar holiday periods between each term, but there is the ability for this to change, {{as it did in the}} Melbourne 2006 Commonwealth Games, when the first term in Victorian schools was shortened to 6 weeks and the other subsequently extended to 12 weeks due to severe disruptions to the public and private bus networks used by school students. Most private schools in Australia have up to four weeks of additional holidays, due to their longer teaching hours during term.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe role of social-distancing measures, such {{as school}} closures, is a {{controversial}} aspect of pandemic mitigation planning. However, the timing of 2009 pandemic provides a natural experiment for evaluating the impact <b>of</b> <b>school</b> closure during <b>holidays</b> on influenza transmission. To quantify the transmission intensity of the influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm’ 09 in India, by estimating the time varying reproduction number (Rt) and correlating the temporal changes in the estimates of Rt for different regions of India with the timing <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays.</b> We used daily lab-confirmed case reports of influenza A (H 1 N 1) pdm’ 09 in India (during 17 May’ 09 to 17 May’ 10), stratified by regions. We estimated the transmissibility of the pandemic for different regions from these time-series, using Bayesian methods applied to a branching process model of disease spread and correlated the resulting estimates with the timing <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> in each region. The North-west region experienced two notable waves, with {{the peak of the}} first wave coinciding with the start of a 4 week <b>school</b> <b>holiday</b> (September–October’ 09). In the southern region the two waves were less clear cut, though again the first peak of the first wave coincided with the start <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> – albeit <b>of</b> less than 2 weeks duration (August’ 09). Our analysis suggests that the <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> had a significant influence on the epidemiology of the 2009 pandemic in India. We estimate that <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> reduced the reproduction number by 14 – 27 % in different regions of India, relative to levels seen outside holiday periods. The estimates of the reproduction number obtained (with peak R values below 1. 5) are compatible with those reported from other regions of the world. This work reinforces past studies showing the significant impact <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> on spread <b>of</b> 2009 pandemic virus, and by inference the role of contact patterns in children on transmission...|$|R

40|$|SummaryBackgroundChronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease (COPD) {{exacerbations}} {{are associated}} with viral infections. We wished to determine if respiratory viral infection {{of children in the}} community was associated with hospital admissions of patients with exacerbations of COPD. MethodsWe collected data over a 45 -month period from the Northern Ireland Regional Virus Laboratory and from a general hospital in the same locality. We studied the relationship between upper respiratory infections in children and COPD admissions. We also examined the role <b>of</b> <b>school</b> <b>holidays.</b> ResultsCorrelations were seen between the frequency of all viral infections in children and the number of adult COPD hospitalizations (P< 0. 005). Subgroup analysis showed distinct relationships with epidemics of; influenza A (P< 0. 001), influenza B (P< 0. 05), adenovirus (P= 0. 05), respiratory syncytial virus (P< 0. 005) and hospital admissions of patients with COPD. There were significantly fewer COPD admissions in the week after the start <b>of</b> a <b>school</b> <b>holiday</b> period (P< 0. 05). ConclusionsWhen children are hospitalized with viral respiratory infection there is an associated rise in adult COPD admissions. This suggests exacerbations of COPD {{are associated with}} epidemics of respiratory viruses. When children are on <b>school</b> <b>holidays</b> there is a reduction in COPD admissions in the community. This provides further support for respiratory viruses in the pathogenesis of COPD exacerbations...|$|R
