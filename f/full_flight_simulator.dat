5|$|On 12 June 2017, Per-Willy Amundsen, Minister of Justice and Public Security, {{announced}} {{the opening of}} Leonard's AW101 Norway Training Centre at Stavanger Sola Airport. The training centre includes an AW101 <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulator</b> (FFS), jointly developed by Leonardo and CAE to Level D, which is a CAE Series 3000 device, along with an AW101 SAR console training system linked to the FFS to provide rear crew training. The first training course at the centre started prior to delivery of the first rotorcraft. The training center will be used by both Norwegian and foreign AW101 customers.|$|E

2500|$|In early 2015, Airbus {{claimed that}} the H160 is {{intended}} to have a [...] "day one" [...] availability rate expectation exceeding 95 percent. The H160 features the Helionix avionics suite, the cockpit being equipped {{with a total of}} four [...] multifunctional displays. Airbus Helicopters collaborated with Esterline CMC to develop portions of the avionics, such as the CMA-9000 Flight Management System and the CMA-5024 GPS landing system sensor, to automate the landing process. A <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> has also been developed for the H160, in partnership with Helisim and Thales Group. The avionics provide a level of commonality with the company's earlier Eurocopter EC145 T2 and Eurocopter EC175 helicopters. Commentators have stated that this commonality to be similar to AgustaWestland's rotorcraft family concept.|$|E

50|$|The company {{started as}} an {{engineering}} consultancy group specializing {{in all aspects}} of microprocessor industrial applications. When the aeronautical regulations later evolved to allow Mechtronix' technology to be offered on to the aviation training market, the graduate students launched in 1996 its family of <b>flight</b> training <b>simulators</b> ranging from software applications to <b>full</b> motion <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulators</b> (FFS). The launch was quickly followed by orders received worldwide for Level D <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>simulators</b> and <b>Flight</b> Training Devices (FTD). Mechtronix today has customer support and services centers in Canada, Europe, and Asia. Textron bought Mechtronix in November 2013.|$|R

50|$|In contrast, civil {{airliner}} <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulators</b> to {{the international}} Level D/Type 7 standard must have a 6-axis platform, and many military simulators for large aircraft and helicopters follow the civil Level D/Type 7 design.|$|R
50|$|Thales Training & Simulation Ltd. is a {{multinational}} company which manufactures <b>simulators,</b> including <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulators</b> and military simulators, and provides related training and support services. It is a wholly owned {{subsidiary of the}} Thales Group.|$|R
50|$|Currently, AXIS {{manufactures}} <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulators</b> and <b>Flight</b> Training Devices for {{all types}} and configurations of aircraft from business jets like the Cessna XLS, to turboprop commuters like ATR 42/72 and passenger jetliners like the Fokker 100.|$|R
50|$|<b>Full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> (FFS) is a {{term used}} by {{national}} (civil) aviation authorities (NAA) for a high technical level of flight simulator. Such authorities include the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) in the United States and the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA).|$|E
50|$|There are {{currently}} four levels of <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulator,</b> levels A - D, level D being the highest standard and being eligible for zero flight time (ZFT) training of civil pilots when converting from one airliner type to another. In about 2012, these FFS levels {{will be changed}} {{as a result of}} work by an international working group chaired by the UK Royal Aeronautical Society Flight Simulation Group (RAeS FSG), which rationalised 27 previous categories of flight training device into 7 international ones. This work has been accepted by ICAO and is published under ICAO document 9625 Issue 3. The new Type 7 <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulator</b> will be the old Level D with enhancements {{in a number of areas}} including motion, visual and Communications/air traffic simulations.|$|E
50|$|In this role, the payload is {{a replica}} cockpit and a visual display system, {{normally}} of several channels, for showing the outside-world visual scene to the aircraft crew {{that are being}} trained. Payload weights {{in the case of}} a <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> for a large transport aircraft can be up to about 15,000 kilogrammes.|$|E
5000|$|Fixed based — No motion platform, {{normally}} {{housed in}} a dome, commonly military application. <b>Full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulators</b> can also be fixed based, these are generally basic training devices that have no visual and are control trainers only.|$|R
50|$|The Toulouse campus has {{a number}} of fixed and <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulators</b> (Robin DR400, Socata TB-20, Airbus A320 and Airbus A340). The air {{navigation}} department has control tower simulators (at 120 or 360 degrees), a ground-controlled approach and an area control center simulator.|$|R
50|$|In November 2006, Baltic Aviation Academy (originally flyLAL Training) was {{established}} {{based on the}} training center of FlyLAL.

5000|$|In 1990, {{in order}} to support {{steadily}} increasing demand, Frasca International again relocated to a 70000 sq ft office building and manufacturing facility in Urbana, Illinois, adjacent to Frasca Field. [...] The new facility provided a substantial increase in manufacturing capacity, and allowed for the production of the company's first <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulator</b> (FFS) a short time after moving to the new location.|$|E
5000|$|... 2004 AXIS {{was founded}} in Graz/Austria by {{aviation}} experts with sophisticated soft- and hardware skills, well proven in the industry. This team of engineers and professional pilots decided to enter the market not in the usual way. Instead of building lower level training devices first and expanding the product range later on, AXIS's first design was already a level D <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulator.</b>|$|E
50|$|In October 1996, a <b>full</b> motion <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> {{was added}} to the squadron's establishment.|$|R
5000|$|... 2010 The {{engineering}} and production departments {{moved to a}} new facility in Lebring. This increase in manufacturing capacity enables the company to manufacture multiple training devices simultaneously. The relocation became necessary with the consecutive orders of two <b>Full</b> <b>Flight</b> <b>Simulators</b> and an accompanying order for a Flat Panel Trainer.|$|R
40|$|The need {{to provide}} {{increased}} access to <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> training for U. S. regional airlines, which historically have been limited by cost considerations {{in the use of}} such equipment for pilot recurrent training, is discussed. In light of that need, the issue of whether more affordable fixed-base <b>simulators,</b> identical to <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulators</b> in all respects except for absence of platform motion, might provide an equivalent level of safety when employed for recurrent training, is examined. Pertinent literature from the past two decades is reviewed. The paper observes that no definitive conclusion can be drawn that would warrant modification of current qualification requirements for platform motion in <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulators.</b> The article concludes that this situation will remain unchanged unless new research is undertaken, which takes into account the lessons learned from past research, and the opportunities engendered by new technology. Broad guidelines for an appropriate research design are discussed...|$|R
50|$|The Stewart {{platform}} {{design is}} extensively used in flight simulation, {{particularly in the}} so-called <b>full</b> <b>flight</b> <b>simulator</b> for which all {{6 degrees of freedom}} are required. This application was developed by Redifon, whose simulators featuring it became available for the Boeing 707, Douglas DC-8, Sud Aviation Caravelle, Canadair CL-44, Boeing 727, Comet, Vickers Viscount, Vickers Vanguard,Convair CV 990, Lockheed C-130 Hercules, Vickers VC10, and Fokker F-27 by 1962.|$|E
5000|$|Most recently, Frasca has {{partnered with}} FlightSafety International {{to produce and}} qualify the first Level 7 FTD in August 2009.
