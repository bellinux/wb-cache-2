2500|$|Prenatal cocaine {{exposure}} (PCE), theorized in the 1970s, {{occurs when}} a pregnant woman uses cocaine and thereby exposes her fetus to the drug. [...] "Crack baby" [...] was a term coined to describe children {{who were exposed to}} crack (<b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine</b> in smokable form) as fetuses; the concept of the crack baby emerged in the US during the 1980s and 1990s {{in the midst of a}} crack epidemic. Other terms are [...] "cocaine baby" [...] and [...] "crack kid". [...] Early studies reported that people who had been exposed to crack in utero would be severely emotionally, mentally, and physically disabled; this belief became common in the scientific and lay communities. Fears were widespread that a generation of crack babies were going to put severe strain on society and social services as they grew up. Later studies failed to substantiate the findings of earlier ones that PCE has severe disabling consequences; these earlier studies had been methodologically flawed (e.g. with small sample sizes and confounding factors). Scientists have come to understand that the findings of the early studies were vastly overstated and that most people who were exposed to cocaine in utero do not have disabilities.|$|E

Some research suggests that smoking <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine</b> can be even more cardiotoxic than other routes of administration because of methylecgonidine's effects on lung tissue and liver tissue.|$|E

50|$|Like {{other forms}} of cocaine, smoking crack can {{increase}} heart rate and blood pressure, leading to long-term cardiovascular problems. Some research suggests that smoking crack or <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine</b> has additional health risks compared to other methods of taking cocaine. Many of these issues relate specifically {{to the release of}} methylecgonidine and its effect on the heart, lungs, and liver.|$|E

5000|$|Pryor's career {{suffered}} a major setback in 1980 {{when he was}} badly burnt while <b>freebasing</b> <b>cocaine,</b> which he acknowledged in his [...] "Live on Sunset Boulevard" [...] performance. During this, he waved a lit match around, and stated, [...] "This is Richard Pryor, Running down the street!" [...] In 1986, Pryor {{announced that he had}} multiple sclerosis and this eventually led to his retirement as a standup comedian in 1992. This album features some material from his 1992 concerts.|$|R

50|$|After {{successful}} arena {{tours in}} 1977 and 1978, further {{work as a}} group was complicated by Crosby's newfound dependence on <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine.</b> Earth & Sky, a 1980 Nash album, was envisaged as a Crosby & Nash project following aborted 1978 CSN sessions until Nash determined that Crosby was not in shape to participate after his colleague stopped a jam to retrieve his freebase pipe.|$|E

The psychological and physiological effects of the paco are quite severe. Media usually report that it is extremely toxic and addictive. According {{to a study by}} Intercambios, media appear to exaggerate the effects of paco. These stereotypes create a sense that nothing can be done to help a paco addict and thus stands in the way of rehabilitation programs.|$|E
50|$|According {{to initial}} police reports, on November 1, 1987 around 7:00 p.m., Steinberg {{rendered}} Lisa unconscious {{with a severe}} blow to the head. Nussbaum remained alone with the dying child for roughly ten hours, failing to notify police or medical personnel. Steinberg departed and returned several times, sometimes <b>freebasing</b> <b>cocaine.</b> According to initial police reports, Nussbaum didn't notify authorities because she believed Steinberg had supernatural healing powers. At roughly 6.00 a.m. the next morning, Lisa stopped breathing. Shortly thereafter, Steinberg telephoned 911 at Nussbaum's urging.|$|R

He was taken to a hospital, where he was treated for second- and third-degree burns {{covering}} more than half of his body. Pryor spent six weeks in recovery at the Grossman Burn Center at Sherman Oaks Hospital. His daughter, Rain, stated that the incident happened {{as a result of a}} bout of drug-induced psychosis.|$|R

50|$|In 1979, Crosby & Nash {{attempted}} {{a new album}} for Capitol Records, but sessions were dampened by Crosby's increased dependence upon <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine.</b> Material from the sessions eventually appeared on Nash's Earth & Sky without any songs from Crosby. Crosby's problems during the 1980s with drugs, and his prison time, precluded any activity solely with Nash, the pair appearing on the CSN and CSNY albums of that decade. The 1990 CSN album Live It Up started as a Crosby & Nash record, but like its predecessor Daylight Again which was initially sessions for a Stills & Nash effort, Atlantic Records was reluctant to release anything that didn't include the full trio.|$|E

In 1983, shortly after her photo spread appeared in Penthouse magazine, she went to an audition for a movie where the director was a well-known porn veteran. There, {{in an effort to}} calm her nervousness, the director offered Lynn a pipe with some <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine.</b> It was her first encounter with the drug; she later described the feeling of being as, [...] "It's as if the birds are singing.

Roger manages to get Stan backstage at a show and onto the tour bus, but when Stan tells a bogus story about <b>freebasing</b> <b>cocaine</b> with 'Tina Jivestrong' & 'the black guy from The Beatles', they get thrown off the bus. Roger steals a car to get them to the next concert in Albany, New York. However, Stan does not get through the backstage entrance after Roger abandons him.|$|R

5000|$|However, by 1981, Holmes {{had become}} desperately {{addicted}} to <b>freebasing</b> <b>cocaine,</b> {{and his career}} had declined due to chronic impotence. In order to settle a substantial debt to drug kingpin Ron Launius, leader of the widely feared Wonderland Gang which dominated the LA cocaine trade in 1981, he conspired to invade Nash's home and commit a robbery in which Nash and his bodyguard were brutalized and humiliated. Two days later Launius and three other people were found bludgeoned to death at their home at 8763 Wonderland Avenue in Laurel Canyon, Los Angeles. Though Nash had planned to have Holmes killed alongside his Wonderland associates, he later decided to spare Holmes' life and use the Wonderland murders to [...] "teach Holmes a lesson" [...] by having him forcibly witness and allegedly partake, albeit against his will, in the quadruple murders.|$|R
5000|$|Based on {{a promise}} he made to Crosby should he clean himself up, Young agreed to rejoin the trio in the studio upon Crosby's release from prison for American Dream in 1988. Stills (then battling his own {{incipient}} addiction to <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine)</b> and Crosby (enfeebled by myriad health problems from his fallow period, eventually necessitating a 1994 liver transplant) were barely functioning for {{the making of the}} album, and the late eighties production completely swamped the band. It did make it to #16 on the Billboard chart, but the record received poor critical notices, and Young refused to support it with a CSNY tour. The band did produce a video for Young's title-song single, wherein each member played a character loosely based on certain aspects of their personalities and public image. CSNY also reunited to play the Bill Graham memorial concert called [...] "Laughter, Love and Music" [...] on November 3, 1991.|$|E

Extremely beautiful as a young woman, Joelle later becomes a member of the Union of the Hideously and Improbably Deformed (U.H.I.D.), and wears a veil to hide her face. According to Molly Notkin, Joelle's face was disfigured by a beaker of acid her mother threw, intending to hit Joelle's father, who had just revealed {{he was in love with}} her (Joelle). Joelle says she wears the veil because her superlative attractiveness plagued her throughout her life, causing her to suffer social and romantic isolation until she met Orin. Joelle tries to [...] "eliminate her own map" [...] (that is, commit suicide) in Notkin's bathroom by massive ingestion of <b>freebase</b> <b>cocaine,</b> which lands her in Ennet House as a resident.

He also wanted to give up drug use and homosexuality and produce an heir. His father refused to attend the wedding, going as far as to place an advertisement in The Times that he had a prior engagement. The marriage lasted for three years, but quickly fell apart after he started <b>freebasing</b> <b>cocaine</b> and using rent boys. During the marriage, the Earl accidentally drove a car half way over a cliff while Francesca was a passenger. They had no children. He later formed a close friendship with James Whitby, who became a companion for most of the remainder of his life.|$|R
