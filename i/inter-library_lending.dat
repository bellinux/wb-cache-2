2500|$|Barnett {{was one of}} {{the first}} advocates for a Canadian {{national}} library. At the opening of the 20th century the Canadian identity was just awakening and the need for national cultural and educational institutions was beginning to be discussed within the broader political arena. Barnett was vocal in his thoughts. Beginning in 1910, J D Barnett saw the function of a national library as storage, lending and <b>inter-library</b> <b>lending</b> with a leadership role in a joint-action agreements between provincial library and a national library with regard to joint functions such as <b>inter-library</b> <b>lending.</b> He saw the primary role of a library as education; a national library’s role within the national educational context. He was also a vocal advocate of advertising any library, but particularly a national library where one had yet to be founded. More controversial at the time, he supported a collections management strategy of quality and not demand. In May 1918 Barnett wrote an article for the Ontario Library Review advocating a national library. [...] Unfortunately timing was not in his favour, and it was not until nearly 20 years after his death that the National Library of Canada was created by an Act of Parliament in 1953 and later as the Library and Archives of Canada.|$|E

40|$|The {{state of}} <b>inter-library</b> <b>lending</b> (ILL) {{in the world}} today is placed {{in the context of the}} still {{developing}} electronic publishing environment: in particular the impact of the big deals, open access and retrospective conversion of serial back-files which have contributed to the dramatic decline in ILL over the last ten years. The factors that influence developments in ILL are identified and analysed. The robust state of ILL and document supply in the US, or American ‘exceptionalism’, will be considered briefly. The continued importance of the inter-lending and document supply service is stressed, given the background of reduced library budgets, increasing serial prices and increasing demands from more researchers for material not held locally. Reference is made to developments in various countries, especially the UK, Denmark, the US and The Netherlands...|$|E
40|$|In 2003 the {{libraries}} of ten municipalities in {{the northern}} part of Sweden were each given 10 000 (SEK) by the BIN-project to purchase books on demand instead of making inter-library loans. This attempt was called Köpa på efterfrågan (Purchasing on demand). The purpose of this master thesis is to evalutate Köpa på efterfrågan. The results of the evaluation show that the books purchased on demand were quite popular. Almost all the purchased books were non-fictional with most books being bought within the field of medicin. There is also a correspondence between the education held in the participating municipality and which subject the purchased books belonged to. The libraries have all made rather similar purchases regarding subject, with the exception of Robertsfors. The most expensive subject was medicin, both per book and overall. The libraries have mostly bought their books on Internet bookstores due to their low cost and swift delivery. Purchasing on demand entails more benefits than <b>inter-library</b> <b>lending,</b> as it is less expensive, and a book, once bought, is available on the shelf for others to borrow it, although the increase of the library’s collection demands more thorough media-planning...|$|E
