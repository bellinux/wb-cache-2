5|$|Sport {{fishing is}} also popular on the Klamath River, with steelhead trout {{being the most}} popular, though Chinook salmon are also highly sought after when low salmon returns do not prevent fishing.

5|$|The {{reservoir}} {{was also}} once popular with anglers (through the Cardiff <b>Fly</b> <b>Fishing</b> Club), picnickers, birdwatchers and walkers. Fishing at the reservoir stopped in 1998 {{and many of}} the other activities have been curtailed since 2004 due to the security fence that was constructed around the banks of the reservoir and (less securely) to the site boundary.|$|E
5|$|Fishing {{is popular}} in the park. Some of the finest <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> in North America {{can be found in}} the streams that flow through Glacier National Park. Though the park {{requires}} that those fishing understand the regulations, no permit is required to fish the waters within the park boundary. The threatened bull trout must be released immediately back to the water if caught; otherwise, the regulations on limits of catch per day are liberal.|$|E
5|$|Caddisflies {{are called}} sedges by anglers. Individual species emerge en masse at {{different}} times, {{and are used}} one after the other, often {{for only a few}} days each year, as models for artificial fishing flies for <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> in trout streams. A mass emergence is known as a hatch. Each type has its own angling name, so for example Mystacides is the dancer; Sericostoma the caperer; Leptocerus the silverhorn; Phryganea the murragh or great red sedge; Brachycentrus subnubilis the grannom; Lepidostoma the silver sedge; Oecetis the longhorn sedge; Cheumatopsyche the little sister sedge; Helicopsyche the speckled Peter, an important fishing fly in North America; and Hydropsyche the specked sedge, perhaps the most important caddisfly genus for anglers with over 50 species of net-makers.|$|E
5000|$|Business grew, and <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> now {{produces}} {{a range of}} beers year-round, along {{with a variety of}} seasonal specialties. <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> beers are ten-time medal winners at the Great American Beer Festival, the most of any New Jersey brewery. Success meant expansion, and in 2012, <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> moved from Cherry Hill to its new facility in Somerdale, making it the largest brewery built in the state since prohibition.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> was {{established}} in 1995 as the world’s first virtual microbrewery, something novel that drew a lot of attention. Capitalizing on this early notoriety, founder Gene Muller took <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> into brick and mortar, constructing the first microbrewery in South Jersey. While New Jersey once boasted more than 50 breweries, <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> was the first new brewery built in Southern New Jersey {{in more than half}} a century.|$|R
50|$|Unshaken by {{this long}} day of attack, <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> closed on Truk once more 2 September 1942, and {{attacked}} a 400-ton patrol vessel, only to see the torpedoes fail to explode upon hitting the target. The patrol ship ran down the torpedo tracks and began a depth charge attack, the second salvo of which damaged <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> considerably. A second patrol ship came out to join the search; <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> successfully evaded both opponents and cleared the area. Determinedly, {{she returned to the}} scene late the next night, and finding a single patrol vessel, sank her with two torpedoes just after midnight early on 4 September. Two hours later a second patrol craft came out, and as <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> launched a stern shot, the Japanese ship opened fire, then swerved to avoid the torpedo. <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> dived for safety, enduring seven depth charge runs by the patrol vessel. Two destroyers joined the patrol craft, and all three kept the submarine under attack for five hours. At last able to get clear, <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> sailed for Pearl Harbor, where she arrived 15 September.|$|R
5|$|Maben was {{concerned}} {{that one of the}} problems with the film was that it was too short. In early 1973, Maben was <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> with Waters, and suggested the possibility of improving the film by watching them at work in a recording studio. Subsequently, Maben was invited with a small crew using a single 35mm camera to Abbey Road Studios to film supposed recording sessions of The Dark Side of the Moon, as well as interviews conducted off-camera by Maben, and footage of the band eating and talking at the studio cafeteria. Maben was particularly happy about this footage, feeling it captured the spontaneous humour of the band. This version premiered on 21 August 1974, and ran for 80 minutes.|$|E
5|$|Some uses {{of heavy}} metals, {{including}} in sport, mechanical engineering, military ordnance, and nuclear science, {{take advantage of}} their relatively high densities. In underwater diving, lead is used as a ballast; in handicap horse racing each horse must carry a specified lead weight, based on factors including past performance, so as to equalize the chances of the various competitors. In golf, tungsten, brass, or copper inserts in fairway clubs and irons lower the centre of gravity of the club making it easier to get the ball into the air; and golf balls with tungsten cores are claimed to have better flight characteristics. In <b>fly</b> <b>fishing,</b> sinking fly lines have a PVC coating embedded with tungsten powder, so that they sink at the required rate. In track and field sport, steel balls used in the hammer throw and shot put events are filled with lead in order to attain the minimum weight required under international rules. Tungsten was used in hammer throw balls at least up to 1980; the minimum size of the ball was increased in 1981 to eliminate the need for what was, at that time, an expensive metal (triple the cost of other hammers) not generally available in all countries. Tungsten hammers were so dense that they penetrated too deeply into the turf.|$|E
25|$|British fly-fishing {{continued}} {{to develop in}} the 19th Century, {{with the emergence of}} <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> clubs, along with the appearance of several books on the subject of fly tying and <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> techniques.|$|E

25|$|Participation in <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> {{peaked in}} the early 1920s in the eastern states of Maine and Vermont and in the Midwest in the spring creeks of Wisconsin.

5000|$|<b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> was {{purchased}} in the West Indies and {{no record of}} the vessel or the transaction reached the Admiralty in London. Unusually, the acquirers gave her the same name as that of another vessel in the area, [...] The pre-existing <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> received a name change to Firefly in 1807, but was wrecked that same year. The new <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> may have been commissioned under Lieutenant H.G. Massie, but if so, command quickly transferred to Lieutenant James Glassford Gooding.|$|R
50|$|In December 1808 <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> was sailing {{along the}} coast of San Domingo, working her way towards Port Royal, Jamaica, with a {{schooner}} in tow, a prize that she had taken. As the weather worsened, Gooding sailed closer to shore. When breakers were sighted ahead, he attempted to turn <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish,</b> but was unable to do so before she grounded. Although the strike was gentle, water poured in and <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish</b> was quickly turned on her side. The prize came in and removed all the men on <b>Flying</b> <b>Fish.</b> The subsequent court martial reprimanded the master for failing to take frequent depth soundings as the vessels approached shore, and admonished Gooding not to sail so close to shore in the future.|$|R

25|$|A major {{concept in}} the sport of <b>fly</b> <b>fishing</b> is that the fly imitates some form of fish prey when {{presented}} to the fish by the angler. As aquatic insects such as Mayflies, Caddisflies and Stoneflies were the primary prey being imitated during the early developmental years of <b>fly</b> <b>fishing,</b> there were always differing schools of thought on how closely a fly needed to imitate the fish's prey.|$|E
