30|$|Material balance {{analysis}} {{is considered a}} powerful engineering tool when dealing with oil and <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> In <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> which can be represented by simple volumetric tanks, a straight line relationship between (P/Z) and cumulative gas production exists. However, many <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> do not follow these simple assumptions. Therefore, several modifications have been presented to handle commingled <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (Fetkovich et al. 1990; El-Banbi and Wattenbarger 1996, 1997; Juell and Whitson 2011) and compartmentalized <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (Hower and Collins 1989; Lord and Collins 1989, 1992; Payne 1996; Hagoort and Hoogstra 1997; Sallam 2016). Although the complications related to either commingled <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> or compartmentalized <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have been addressed, either model alone cannot be applied when both conditions coexist.|$|R
30|$|Composite tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are {{distributed}} widely in anticline belts, deep depressions, and slope zones {{as a result}} of superimposition of conventional and deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in deep basins, also including buoyancy-adjusted deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> reconstructed through subsequent fault or fracture development (e.g., subsequent inner-sag uplifting). Gas charging and accumulation processes are based on early buoyancy and then later on molecular expansive force. Composite tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are formed through accumulation followed by densification and re-accumulation, and two genetic mechanisms can be identified. Driven by the first mechanism, conventional tight and deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of the same depth form before and after reservoir densification, respectively. Given the order of gas accumulation processes, composite tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> are superimposed by different reservoir types following a period of multi-phase hydrocarbon expulsion. The other mechanism refers to partial uplifting in deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> induced by subsequent tectonic adjustments and improved reservoir physical properties close to those of conventional reservoirs (low porosity and high permeability) {{as a result of}} fault and fracture reconstruction. Buoyancy then occurs again, changing partial gas–water distribution and maintaining large gas-bearing areas in deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> ultimately leading to the development of composite tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of an adjusted genesis (Pang et al. 2013, 2014).|$|R

25|$|The {{original}} {{agreement between}} Home Oil and British Gas was a 15-year contract valued at £27million for {{the delivery of}} 75 million standard cubic feet per day (MMSCFD) (2.1 million m3/d) of gas with a maximum flow of 100 MMSCFD (2.8 million m3/d). By 1974 aquifer water ingress into the <b>gas</b> <b>reservoir</b> had significantly reduced gas production to about 1 MMSCFD (28,300 m3/d). The production and gas treatment facility was permanently shutdown in October 1974. Over three years it had produced 11.3 billion standard cubic feet of gas (320 million standard m3), only 4.5% of the estimated recoverable reserves.|$|E
25|$|Because {{natural gas}} is not a pure product, as the {{reservoir}} pressure drops when non-associated gas is extracted from a field under supercritical (pressure/temperature) conditions, the higher molecular weight components may partially condense upon isothermic depressurizing—an effect called retrograde condensation. The liquid thus formed may get trapped as the pores of the <b>gas</b> <b>reservoir</b> get depleted. One method {{to deal with this}} problem is to re-inject dried gas free of condensate to maintain the underground pressure and to allow re-evaporation and extraction of condensates. More frequently, the liquid condenses at the surface, and one of the tasks of the gas plant is to collect this condensate. The resulting liquid is called natural gas liquid (NGL) and has commercial value.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{scholars}} in China and abroad have carried out studies on accumulation mechanisms and type classifications of tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> Based on reservoir characteristics, Guan and Niu (1995) divided tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into three types: good (dense), moderate (overly dense), and poor (extremely dense). Law (2002) classified tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in central basin areas into two types, direct and indirect, {{in light of}} organic matter types of source rocks. Jiang et al. (2006) divided tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into three types, the “densification–accumulation” (DA) deep tight type and the “accumulation–densification” (AD) tight conventional type, based on hydrocarbon expulsion peak timing and reservoir densification evolution. Dong et al. (2007) classified tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into reformed and original types based on relationships between tight gas accumulation and structural evolution and different accumulation principles. Zou et al. (2011 a) classified tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into slope lithological and deep structural types based on formation conditions, distribution characteristics, trap types, exploration practices, etc. Guo et al. (2012), based on accumulation modes, divided accumulation zones of tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into continuous and transitional types. Dai et al. (2012) classified tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into continuous and trap types based on reservoir characteristics, reserves, and structural locations. Li et al. (2012) classified tight sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> into slope, anticline structural, and deep sag types based on structural locations, accumulation mechanisms, and evolution principles. Zhao et al. (2012), according to trap types and distribution, proposed continuous, quasi-continuous, and non-continuous type classifications. However, all of the classifications noted above pertain to geological features of <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> without classifying tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> based on accumulation dynamics.|$|R
30|$|With {{reservoirs}} in deep depressions first {{reach the}} lower limit of buoyancy accumulation, deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> first form in deep depressions and gradually extend outward (Song et al. 2013). Deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> have always expanded symmetrically from central areas of depressions (e.g., <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Red Desert Basin of Wyoming {{and in the}} San Juan Basin of New Mexico, USA), from foreland lateral margin slopes (e.g., <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in Elmworth of Alberta, Canada and in the Green River Basin of Wyoming, USA), and from structural slope belts (e.g., Milk River <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in Alberta, Canada and Clinton sandstone <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Appalachian Basin of eastern Ohio, USA). “Four low, two large, and one close contact” principles are thus used as discriminant criteria for deep tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> “Four low” denotes hydrocarbon accumulation and inversion in structurally low positions, enrichment in zones of relatively low porosity and permeability, and stable reservoir formation under low pressure. “Two large” denotes large distribution area and large reserve scale. “One close contact” denotes close contact between source rocks and reservoirs (Pang et al. 2014).|$|R

In this paper, we summarize the geological {{features of the}} source rocks and “continuous” tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> in the Xujiahe Formation of the middle-south transition region, Sichuan Basin. The source rocks of the Xul Member and reservoir rocks of the Xu 2 Member are thick (Xul Member: 40 m, Xu 2 Member: 120 m) and are distributed continuously in this study area. The results of drilled wells show that the widespread sandstone reservoirs of the Xu 2 Member are charged with natural gas. Therefore, the natural <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> of the Xu 2 Member in the middle-south transition region are “continuous” tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs.</b> The accumulation of “continuous” tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> is controlled by an adequate driving force of the pressure differences between source rocks and reservoirs, which is demonstrated by a “one-dimensional” physical simulation experiment.

30|$|Therefore, {{conventional}} tight reservoirs {{are characterized}} by: distribution in structurally high areas; partial enrichment in zones of relatively high porosity and permeability; no direct connection between sources and reservoirs; overlaying cap rocks that {{play a significant}} role in sealing processes; a uniform gas–water interface; higher inner pressure than hydrostatic pressure under a stable state; continuously high pressure; and relatively small distribution areas and reserve scales. By trap type, conventional tight reservoirs can be subdivided into anticlinal tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> fault block tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> lithological tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs,</b> and stratigraphic tight <b>gas</b> <b>reservoirs</b> (Pang et al. 2014).|$|R

Although Ozkan et al. (2010) and Brown et al.
