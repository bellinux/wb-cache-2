First, market signals can act ex ante in the competition among different paradigms: if more paradigms are available, firms would select {{one or the other}} according to their <b>expected</b> <b>profitability.</b> But once a paradigm is affirmed, the direction of technological change would be already implied by its technological prescriptions. Second, market signals can act by selecting ex post those applications of the affirmed paradigm (i.e. the final products) that best fit the market requests. However, at that point their impact on the direction of technical change would be null, since such direction had already been decided by the prescriptions of the affirmed paradigm.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the primary}} reasons that sellers elect out of the {{installment}} method is the harsh treatment of contingencies in the regulations accompanying IRC 453. Contingent payments are common in some types of installment sales, where, for example, payments {{are based on the}} actual rather than the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of the item sold (typically some percentage of the future profits). Where the contract calls for contingent payments, the regulations recognize three possibilities.|$|E

50|$|Venture {{capital is}} a way of {{corporate}} financing by which a financial investor takes participation in the capital of a new or young private company in exchange for cash and strategic advice. Venture capital investors look for fast-growing companies with low leverage capacity and high-performing management teams. Their main objective is to make a profit by selling the stake in the company in the medium term. They <b>expect</b> <b>profitability</b> higher than the market to compensate for the increased risk of investing in young ventures. In addition to this, there are also corporate venture capitalists (Corporate venture capital) that strongly focus on strategic benefits.|$|R
50|$|For both {{business}} {{within the}} market and consumers, a single market is a competitive environment, making the existence of monopolies more difficult. This means that inefficient companies will suffer a loss of market share and may have to close down. However, efficient firms can benefit from economies of scale, increased competitiveness and lower costs, as well as <b>expecting</b> <b>profitability</b> to increase as a result. Consumers are benefited by the single market {{in the sense that}} the competitive environment brings them cheaper products, more efficient providers of products and also increased choice of products. What is more, businesses in competition will innovate to create new products; another benefit for consumers.|$|R

50|$|Profit-at-Risk (PaR) {{is a risk}} {{management}} quantity most often used for electricity portfolios that contain some mixture of generation assets, trading contracts and end-user consumption. It is used to provide {{a measure of the}} downside risk to profitability of a portfolio of physical and financial assets, analysed by time periods in which the energy is delivered. For example, the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> and associated downside risk (PaR) might be calculated and monitored for each of the forward looking 24 months. The measure considers both price risk and volume risk (e.g. due to uncertainty in electricity generation volumes or consumer demand). Mathematically, the PaR is the quantile of the profit distribution of a portfolio. Since weather related volume risk drivers can be represented in the form of historical weather records over many years, a Monte-Carlo simulation approach is often used.|$|E
5000|$|Sidecars have {{precedents}} in the reinsurance market {{under the}} name [...] "quota-share reinsurance." [...] In such an agreement, a re/insurer agrees to cede to the quota-share reinsurer a percentage of all premiums arising from a book of business {{in exchange for the}} reinsurer bearing the same percentage liability for losses. The quota-share reinsurer pays an amount called the [...] "ceding commission" [...] to compensate the ceding company for its expenses. The ceding commission typically also includes a profit allowance, which increases in proportion to the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of the business. These reinsurance treaties currently and traditionally provide ceding companies with the ability to write more business than they could bear based on their own capital and to earn a certain amount of fee-based income (through the ceding commission). Quota-share reinsurers act as insurance wholesalers, allowing them to earn a return on capital without creating primary insurance distribution. Lloyd's of London [...] "names" [...] act as such reinsurers, placing the resources of individual and firms at risk to books of business written by professional underwriters and agents.|$|E

40|$|We use a {{variance}} decomposition {{approach to}} examine why aggregate valuation ratios differ across countries. In {{a cross section}} of 22 developed countries from 1980 to 2009, we find that 50 percent of all cross-country differences in the aggregate price-to-book ratio (P/B) can be explained by cross-country differences in <b>expected</b> future five-year <b>profitability.</b> In the second half of our sample period, this percentage exceeds that of the first half, rising to almost 64 percent. Although international differences in accounting standards and conventions may have made earnings from different countries more difficult to compare relative to dividends, we find that it is still cross-country differences in <b>expected</b> future <b>profitability,</b> rather than dividend growth rates, that are more closely related to international differences in valuation ratios. Even among 25 emerging markets, we find that <b>expected</b> future <b>profitability</b> at the five-year horizon can account for 29 percent of all cross-country P/B variations. Our results show that international investors are able to identify substantial cross-country differences in future-earnings prospects and incorporate them into stock market valuations.

40|$|The {{selection}} of a portfolio encounters several extremely complex situations. From among them, {{it has to be}} highlighted, due to its difficulty and transcendence, the Financial Assets selection when interrelations (positive and/or negative) occur among the <b>expected</b> <b>profitabilities</b> of each one of them. The tools traditionally used have tried to approach it by simplifying reality and, therefore, the obtained results are not fully satisfactory. This situation has encouraged the authors to questioning whether better solutions can be reached by applying the so called Intelligent Technologies. Thus, one of the available tools is the one constituted by Genetic Algorithms, due to its utility when offering solutions to complex optimization problems. Furthermore, by using the Fuzzy Sets Theory, we intend to obtain a closer representation for the uncertainty that characterises Financial Market. This way, it is intended to outline an approach to solve Financial Assets selection problems for a portfolio in a non-linear and uncertainty environment, by applying a Fuzzy Genetic Algorithm to optimize the investment profitability...|$|R

40|$|Evidence {{that cash}} flow has a {{significant}} effect on investment after controlling for Tobin's average Q has been interpreted as suggesting the importance of financing constraints. Recent work shows that the Q model may not be identified if there are `bubbles' in stock market valuations that are persistent and correlated with fundamental values. Cash flow may then provide additional information about <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> that is not captured by average Q. Using data on UK companies, we find severe measurement error in average Q.

40|$|This paper empirically {{investigates the}} impact of {{exchange}} rate shocks on corporate investment. An intertemporal optimization model is developed in which an individual corporation in an open economy adjusts its capital stock according to the Tobinfs q, which represents the future stream of the profit rate and changes by the real exchange rate. By explicitly considering the marginal q, the transmission mechanism from real exchange rate shocks to investment dynamics via <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> is examined based on the Vector Autoregressive model. Empirical {{evidence suggests that the}} depreciation of the Japanese yen increases the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of the firm and stimulates corporate investment, especially in the machinery sector.

40|$|Commercialization of new {{carbon capture}} {{simulation}} initiative (CCSI) technology will include two {{key elements of}} risk management, namely, technical risk (will process and plant performance be effective, safe, and reliable) and enterprise risk (can project losses and costs be controlled within the constraints of market demand to maintain profitability and investor confidence). Both of these elements of risk are incorporated into the risk analysis subtask of Task 7. Thus far, this subtask has developed a prototype demonstration tool that quantifies risk based on the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of expenditures when retrofitting carbon capture technology on a stylized 650 MW pulverized coal electric power generator. The prototype {{is based on the}} selection of specific technical and financial factors believed to be important determinants of the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of carbon capture, subject to uncertainty. The uncertainty surrounding the technical performance and financial variables selected thus far is propagated in a model that calculates the <b>expected</b> <b>profitability</b> of investments in carbon capture and measures risk in terms of variability in expected net returns from these investments. Given the preliminary nature of the results of this prototype, additional work is required to expand the scope of the model to include additional risk factors, additional information on extant and proposed risk factors, the results of a qualitative risk factor elicitation process, and feedback from utilities and other interested parties involved in the carbon capture project. Additional information on proposed distributions of these risk factors will be integrated into a commercial implementation framework for the purpose of a comparative technology investment analysis...|$|E
