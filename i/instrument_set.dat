40|$|Comments are welcome. Please do not quote Abstract: A panel {{data model}} which {{combines}} an autoregressive fixed effects panel data equation and a static equation with measurement errors is considered. Examples of models for pure time series data with errors in variables are the starting point. Two {{versions of the}} Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) for this panel data model are considered, with fixed effects accounted for by, respectively, (i) transforming the equation to differences and keeping the instruments in levels, (ii) keeping the equation in levels and transforming the instruments to differences. In specifying the set of valid moment conditions and <b>instrument</b> <b>sets,</b> patterns with finite memory of disturbances, of latent regressors and of the measurement errors are discussed. Focus is on examining how the potential <b>instrument</b> <b>sets</b> which satisfy both the rank conditions for the instrumented variables and the orthogonality conditions for the composite errors and disturbances, change when the model’s memory pattern changes. Sometimes the joint occurrence of measurement errors and long memories implies that the potential <b>instrument</b> <b>sets</b> becomes too small to make consistent estimation possible. An application based on panel data for capital stock and output from Norwegian manufacturing firms is presented...|$|R

50|$|The Yamaha CP-300 has 88 {{graduated}} weighted keys. This {{means that}} the keys are somewhat heavier on the low end than the high. It has onboard stereo speakers, {{as well as an}} output for PA usage. Yamaha digitally sampled in stereo each key at multiple attack intensities to obtain the tonal quality, presence, hammer and damper noises of an acoustic piano. The harpsichord (including pick noise), pipe organ, and other sampled instruments in main <b>instrument</b> <b>set</b> were also sampled. The extended <b>instrument</b> <b>set</b> of over a hundred instruments are generated, rather than sampled. The MIDI interface can control other instruments or be controlled. It also has onboard digital recording and editing capabilities. Like other stage pianos, it is built for touring.
