[...] The school also offers 33 {{undergraduate and graduate}} certificates. With a number of interdisciplinary degree programs, its curriculum is designed to allow study that crosses traditional disciplinary lines and enable {{students to participate in}} collaborative research labs. In 2002 the UTD Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science was the first in the United States to offer an ABET-accredited B.S. degree in telecommunications engineering. UTD's Arts and Technology program is Texas's first comprehensive degree designed to merge computer science and engineering with creative arts and the humanities. In 2004 the School of Arts and Humanities introduced the Arts and Technology (ATEC) program with the Erik Jonsson School of Engineering and Computer Science, and in 2008 a complementary major, Emerging Media and Communication (EMAC), was offered. In January 2007 the university offered the first doctoral degree in criminology in Texas. The School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences administers the degree. The Bioengineering department offers MS and PhD degrees in biomedical engineering in conjunction with programs at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas and the University of Texas at Arlington. <b>Geospatial</b> <b>Information</b> Sciences is jointly offered with the School of Natural Sciences and Mathematics and with the School of Economic, Political and Policy Sciences (EPPS), which administers the degree.

The present work aims to evaluate the operational {{efficiency in}} wood forest chips supply chain in an alpine contest. Wood chips availability is related to ordinary forest operations and it is evaluated in relation to logging residues and un-merchantable logs availability after planned harvesting and logging operations. Evaluation about the most realistic availability of un-merchantable logs for energy production is based on analysis of previous forest utilization data. Further analysis concerns forest operations cost and working site features according to forest road net and terrain characteristics. Geospatial analysis is thus applied in order to define supply cost according to transport cost. Thus forest biomass suitable to be used as wood fuel is determined and classified according to supply cost and wood fuel quality. <b>Geospatial</b> <b>informations</b> are used then to define the supply plan up to three years. Supply plan will be investigated according to supply cost, yearly available amount and wood chips quality...|$|R
