25|$|Segregation in {{education}} has major social repercussions. The prejudice that many young African-Americans experience causes them undue stress {{which has been}} proven to undermine cognitive development. Eric Hanushek and his co-authors have considered racial concentrations in schools, and they find large and important effects. Black students appear to be systematically and physically hurt by larger concentrations of black students <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>school.</b> These effects extend neither to white nor to Hispanic students in the school, implying that they are related to peer interactions and not to school quality. Moreover, {{it appears that the}} effect of black concentrations in schools is largest for high achieving black students.|$|E
25|$|By {{the time}} Navalar was born, Protestants from England and America had {{established}} nine mission {{stations in the}} Jaffna peninsula.

25|$|Justice Anthony Kennedy did {{not join}} {{the rest of the}} opinion by the Chief Justice, therefore, those parts of the opinion did not command a majority. In this Plurality Opinion, Roberts wrote that the Schools at issue contend that a racially diverse {{environment}} is beneficial for education and they submit this as the reason why they consider race alone <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>school</b> assignments. However, Roberts considers that this interest is not compelling and that the use of race for this goal is not narrowly tailored, it is instead used for racial balancing, which is unconstitutional. The schools base their numbers in demographics, therefore making this goal a means to achieve a numerical quota to achieve racial balancing. Roberts concludes that racial balancing cannot be a compelling state interest.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] North-West University, Vaal Triangle Campus, 2007 The aims of this {{research}} were to determine, {{by means of the}} literature review research, the nature {{of the impact of the}} HIVIAIDS epidemic on school systems and the role of School Management Teams in dealing with this epidemic; to determine the perceptions of principals, deputy principals and heads of department on the impact of HIVIAIDS on educators, learners and the teaching and learning situation; and to make suggestions for a strategic management approach which School Management Teams can adopt in dealing with the HlV/AlDS epidemic at <b>their</b> <b>schools.</b> The literature review proceedings revealed that the HlV/AlDS epidemic has a potential to affect schools through the following ways: reduction in demand for schooling among children and adolescents of school-going age; reduction in supply of teaching services due to educator absenteeism, illness, medical boarding because of ill-health, and death; reduction in availability of educational resources because the Department of Education spends more money on HlVlAlDS than on schools' material resources; the need for schools to social adjust in response to the special needs of a rapidly increasing number of learner orphans as a result of the HIVIAIDS epidemic; the need to adapt to new social interactions both within schools and between schools and communities; the need to modify curriculum to meet the needs of an HIVIAIDS era; the need to alter roles that have to be adopted by educators and the school systems; the need to organize school systems systemically; the need for effective management of the school system; and the need for donor support for schools. The empirical research proceedings revealed that the majority of School Management Team participants were frustrated; stressed; had a decreased interest in teaching as a profession; not coping with the demands of the teaching and learning situation during this era of the HlV/AlDS epidemic; experiencing low morale; depressed; and were feeling like resigning. The School Management Team participants also revealed during the empirical research proceedings that the HlVlAlDS epidemic has a detrimental effect on the teaching and learning situation <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; classes <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> are too big; it is impossible for them to pay attention to individual learners; learners of <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> are frequently absent; educator workload <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> is too heavy; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> are not motivated; there is frequent absence of educators <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> due to family responsibilities; there is frequent absence of educators <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> due to personal illness; lack of motivation among learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; there is positive social interactions of learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> do not suffer from hyperactivity; there is passivity of learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> classrooms; there is an indication of nervousness among learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; there is poor discipline <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; absenteeism of learners is moderate <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; tiredness of learners is a problem; learners lack motivation; learners lack concentration; learners exhibit memory loss; learners experience poor attention span; learners have developed decreased interest in school and school activities; learners manifest personal illnesses; illness of family members is a problem <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> have experienced loss of family members; learners of <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> have too many responsibilities at their homes; poor academic performance is experienced <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; many learners suffer rejection from their peer groups; learners do not have <b>school</b> related problems <b>in</b> <b>their</b> schools; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> suffer from diarrhea; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> suffer from pneumonia; learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> suffer from tuberculosis; and learners <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>schools</b> suffer from severe weight loss.

Another scene from the episode sees Ms. Hoover telling the students to stare at the blackboard for fifteen minutes until class is over. Daspit and Weaver write that it is [...] "the absolute power that teachers have over students' every action that allows for the image to be presented on The Simpsons. It would be comforting to tell ourselves that this is simply parody run amok, that the writers are stretching reality to make a point, but the discussants in the study [...] had memories of a reality very much like the one presented in this program."
