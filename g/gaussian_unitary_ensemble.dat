40|$|We {{present the}} results of {{experimental}} and theoretical study of irregular, tetrahedral microwave networks consisting of coaxial cables (annular waveguides) connected by T-joints. The spectra of the networks were measured in the frequency range 0. 0001 - 16 GHz {{in order to obtain}} their statistical properties such as the integrated nearest neighbor spacing distribution and the spectral rigidity. The comparison of our experimental and theoretical results shows that microwave networks can simulate quantum graphs with time reversal symmetry. In particular, we use the spectra of the microwave networks to study the periodic orbits of the simulated quantum graphs. We also present experimental study of directional microwave networks consisting of coaxial cables and Faraday isolators for which the time reversal symmetry is broken. In this case our experimental results indicate that spectral statistics of directional microwave networks deviate from predictions of Gaussian orthogonal ensembles (GOE) in random matrix theory approaching, especially for small eigenfrequency spacing s, results for <b>Gaussian</b> <b>unitary</b> <b>ensembles</b> (GUE).

In particular, in addition to providing an elementary derivation of the aforementioned σ-form and Painleve IV we show that the quantity r_n(a) satisfies a particular case of Chazy's second degree second order differential equation. For the discrete equations we show that the quantity r_n(a) satisfies a particular form of the modified discrete Painleve II equation obtained by Grammaticos and Ramani in the context of Backlund transformations.
