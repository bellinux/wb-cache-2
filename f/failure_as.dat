5|$|In September 2009, {{more than}} two years after the accident, CENIPA {{announced}} the results of official investigations. The report shows that one of the thrust levers, which control engines, was in position to accelerate when it should be in idle, but it was not proved if there was mechanical or human <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> the cause of the accident.|$|E
5|$|It did {{not seem}} to Dietz as if there was any {{relationship}} between critical praise and audience enthusiasm for January films. The best-rated, Disney's 2004 animated musical Teacher's Pet, was a commercial <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> was 2001's The Pledge. Cloverfield, the third entry, was a success, and behind it Freedom Writers had ridden its good reviews to do some modest box office in 2007; however How She Move had flopped that same year.|$|E
5|$|Steiger died of {{pneumonia}} and kidney <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> {{a result of}} complications from surgery for a gall bladder tumor on July 9, 2002, in Los Angeles, and was buried in Forest Lawn– Hollywood Hills Cemetery.

5|$|The {{tactical}} {{assessment of}} both sides was radically different. Bomber Command believed the attack was a <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> a result of poor formation flying and leadership. It was also maintained that better beam defensive armament and self-sealing fuel tanks were needed. These tactical considerations might, they believed, still salvage the day-bomber concept.|$|E
5|$|Abhishek Bachchan is an Indian {{actor and}} {{producer}} {{known for his}} work in Bollywood films. He made his debut in 2000, opposite Kareena Kapoor, in the J. P. Dutta-directed war drama Refugee. His portrayal of the titular unnamed refugee garnered him a nomination for Best Male Debut at the Filmfare Awards ceremony. However, the film was a box office <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> were a series of his subsequent films, including Bas Itna Sa Khwaab Hai (2001), and Shararat (2002). His career prospects improved in 2004, when he played a gangster in the Mani Ratnam-directed political drama Yuva, and a police officer in Sanjay Gadhvi's action thriller Dhoom. For the former, he won his first Filmfare Award for Best Supporting Actor, and the latter became one of the highest-grossing films of the year and his first commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Although Tito's headquarters, {{along with}} several other Partisan organisations, was {{temporarily}} disrupted and key staff were lost during the operation, all Partisan organisations were quickly re-located and resumed operation. Drvar reverted to Partisan control {{within a few weeks}} of the operation. The operation was a <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> Tito, his principal headquarters staff and the allied military personnel escaped, despite their presence in Drvar {{at the time of the}} airborne assault. The operation failed due to a number of factors, including Partisan resistance in the town itself and along the approaches to Drvar. The failure of the various German intelligence agencies to share the limited intelligence available on Tito's exact location also contributed to the unsuccessful outcome for the Germans, and this failure to share intelligence was compounded by a lack of contingency planning by the commander of the German airborne force.|$|E

40|$|Considering such crucial {{issues as}} hype and hope in {{adopting}} new technologies, quality assurance, professional development, leadership, management and research, the authors conclude by recommending more wide-ranging and in-depth studies into the efficacy, scalability, and transferability of new methods and technologies, {{and the need}} to publicise the <b>failures</b> <b>as</b> well as the successes...|$|R
5|$|Although the Charter of 1215 was a <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> a peace treaty, it was resurrected {{under the}} new {{government}} of the young Henry III {{as a way of}} drawing support away from the rebel faction. On his deathbed, King John appointed a council of thirteen executors to help Henry reclaim the kingdom, and requested that his son be placed into the guardianship of William Marshal, {{one of the most famous}} knights in England. William knighted the boy, and Cardinal Guala Bicchieri, the papal legate to England, then oversaw his coronation at Gloucester Cathedral on 28 October.|$|E
5|$|As {{the wine}} {{business}} began to prosper, Schnaufer also gave thought to alternative employment possibilities in peacetime aviation. With his wartime friend Hermann Greiner, he traveled from Weil am Rhein to Bern in Switzerland to meet South American diplomats; the two {{hoped to find}} employment as pilots in South America. To get to Bern, they crossed the Swiss-German border illegally. The meeting was a <b>failure.</b> <b>As</b> they returned to Germany, they were caught by Swiss border guards attempting to make a second illegal border crossing. The Swiss handed {{them over to the}} French occupation authorities and they were imprisoned in Lörrach, where they remained until Schnaufer managed to make contact with a French general, who was a customer of the Schnaufer winery and had them released. This misadventure kept him away from his business for about half a year.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the remote}} {{location}} of the Itcha Range, future eruptions are not a major hazard. Future volcanism is most likely {{in the form of}} basaltic cinder cones, but eruptions of felsic magma can not be ruled out. The most immediate hazard relating to future eruptions is of local concern only and includes the possibility of forest fires by lava flows and the disruption of local air traffic if an eruption column is produced. Volcanic ash reduces visibility and can cause jet engine <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> well as damage to other aircraft systems.|$|E
40|$|The Time-Triggered Architecture (TTA) is an {{architecture}} for safety-critical applications. Fault-tolerance mechanisms are therefor of upmost importance to ensure correct system operation in presence of <b>failures</b> <b>as</b> well as after transient disturbances. Currently the TTA tolerates one faulty component. Multiple transient failures are {{outside of the}} fault hypothesis of the TTA and scenarios can be established, after multiple transient failures, which cannot be corrected by the conventional TTA mechanism. Therefore, we propose an algorithm, for correction of the system after multiple transient <b>failures,</b> <b>as</b> an extension to the faulttolerance mechanisms of the TTA. Furthermore, we discuss variations of this algorithm...|$|R

5|$|By August {{the plan}} was already behind schedule: severe {{shortages}} of stores and wages slowed work at the Brest shipyards, while the troops {{set aside for the}} invasion of Cornwall proved unreliable, deserting in large numbers. A practice voyage of the Cornish invasion fleet ended in total <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> the small ships intended for the operation proved unable to operate in open water. The plan was dropped and the reliable soldiers from the unit were merged into the Ireland expeditionary force and the rest returned to prison. Reinforcements from the Mediterranean Fleet were also delayed: seven ships from the expedition under Contre-amiral Joseph de Richery had to shelter from the British blockade squadron in Rochefort, only arriving in Brest on 8 December, while a second squadron under Contre-amiral Pierre-Charles Villeneuve did not arrive until after the expeditionary force had departed.|$|E
5|$|Conker the Squirrel {{also had}} its own game. Originally named Conker's Quest, the title was renamed to Twelve Tales: Conker 64. However, the new title was criticised for being too family-friendly and too similar to Banjo-Kazooie. As a result, the team renamed the game to Conker's Bad Fur Day and was re-revealed again in 2000. Conker's Bad Fur Day, unlike Banjo-Kazooie, was {{intended}} for a mature audience, and features violence, profanity and scatological humour. The game received positive reviews from critics, but was a commercial <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> the game was released {{at the end of}} the Nintendo 64's life cycle and the game was not actively promoted by Nintendo.|$|E
5|$|Despite Lee's {{hope for}} an early start, it took all morning to arrange the {{infantry}} assault force. Neither Lee's nor Longstreet's headquarters sent orders to Pickett to have his division on the battlefield by daylight. Historian Jeffrey D. Wert blames this oversight on Longstreet, describing it either as a misunderstanding of Lee's verbal order or a mistake. Some of the many criticisms of Longstreet's Gettysburg performance by the postbellum Lost Cause authors cite this <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> evidence that Longstreet deliberately undermined Lee's plan for the battle.|$|E

5|$|Georg Eduard Albert Krugers (Banda Neira, 4 November 1890 – The Hague, 10 August 1964; {{also written}} as G. Kruger) was a {{cameraman}} and film director {{active in the}} Dutch East Indies (modern Indonesia) during the early 20th century. He is recorded as having worked in film since the mid-1920s, and in 1927 he made his directorial debut, Eulis Atjih. He joined hajj pilgrims in 1928 and screened the resulting documentary in the Netherlands. His 1930 film Karnadi Anemer Bangkong {{is thought to be}} the first talkie in the cinema of the Indies, but was a commercial <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> the majority Sundanese audience considered it insulting. After making two works for Tan's Film in the early 1930s, Krugers moved to Hong Kong and then the Netherlands.|$|E
5|$|In 1886, Black Allan (later {{known as}} Allan F-1) was born. By the {{stallion}} Allendorf (from the Hambletonian family of Standardbreds) {{and out of}} a Morgan mare named Maggie Marshall, he became the foundation sire of the Tennessee Walking Horse breed. A <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> a trotting horse, due to his insistence on pacing, he was instead used for breeding. From his line, a foal named Roan Allen was born in 1904. Able to perform several ambling gaits, Roan Allen became a successful show horse, and in turn sired several famous Tennessee Walking Horses.|$|E
5|$|In August2007, Frank Beamer closed team {{practices}} to outside observers {{for the first}} time in 20years. He cited concerns about unknown individuals watching Virginia Tech practice in Atlanta before the Hokies' loss to Georgia, potentially leading to the defeat. During the 2007season, Virginia Tech quarterback Sean Glennon was replaced as the Hokies' starter by freshman Tyrod Taylor, causing many pundits to point to the four interceptions Glennon threw in the Chick-fil-A Bowl as an example of his <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> a quarterback. Brian Mimbs, the former walk-on who kicked and recovered the onside kick that began Georgia's rally was named the Bulldogs' starting punter for the 2007 season, partially due to his performance in the Chick-fil-A Bowl.|$|E

India lost the Test series 3–0 and the margin of defeat was heavy {{in each of these}} matches – 285 runs, 180 runs, innings and 141 runs. The highlight of the Test series came in the final Test when V. V. S. Laxman scored 167 at a run a ball in fading light at the Sydney Cricket Ground and came for much praise from the media. India's ODI series performance matched the Test series in <b>failure</b> <b>as</b> India managed to win just one match against Pakistan and Kapil had to come out in defense of his team.|$|E
5|$|Problems also {{arose in}} Mikan's {{professional}} sports career. In the 1957–58 NBA season, Lakers coach John Kundla became {{general manager and}} persuaded Mikan to become coach of the Lakers. However, this was a <b>failure,</b> <b>as</b> the Lakers endured a 9–30 record until Mikan stepped down and returned coaching duties to Kundla. The Lakers ended with a 19–53 record, to record {{one of the worst}} seasons in their history. After this failure, Mikan then concentrated on his law career, raising his family of six children, successfully specializing in corporate and real estate law, and buying and renovating buildings in Minneapolis.|$|E
