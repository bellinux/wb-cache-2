5|$|Every {{configuration}} of Rule 90 has exactly four predecessors, other configurations {{that form the}} given configuration after a single step. Therefore, in contrast to many other cellular automata such as Conway's Game of Life, Rule 90 has no <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden, a configuration with no predecessors. It {{provides an example of}} a cellular automaton that is surjective (each configuration has a predecessor) but not injective (it has sets of more than one configuration with the same successor), showing that the converse of the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden theorem is not true.|$|E

5|$|In Rule 90, on an {{infinite}} one-dimensional lattice, every configuration has exactly four predecessor configurations. This is because, in a predecessor, any two consecutive cells may have {{any combination of}} states, but once those two cells' states are chosen, {{there is only one}} consistent choice for the states of the remaining cells. Therefore, there is no <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden in Rule 90, a configuration with no predecessors. The Rule 90 configuration consisting of a single nonzero cell (with all other cells zero) has no predecessors that have finitely many nonzeros. However, this configuration is not a <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden because it does have predecessors with infinitely many nonzeros.|$|E

5|$|Marge {{dreams that}} she and Homer are Adam and Eve. They peacefully live in the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden until a snake (Snake Jailbird) tempts Adam into eating dozens of apples from the {{forbidden}} tree. He persuades Eve to try one when God (Ned Flanders) witnesses his sin. Even though Adam ate many apples, God only caught Eve eating an apple, and she is therefore banished from the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden. Adam is unwilling to come clean, but misses Eve and thinks {{of a way of}} getting her back in by digging a tunnel with the help of some of the animals. God's unicorn, named Gary, becomes exhausted from the digging and dies just before God catches Adam trying to smuggle Eve back into the Garden. The death of the unicorn enrages him further, and he expels them both from the <b>Garden</b> <b>of</b> Eden.|$|E
