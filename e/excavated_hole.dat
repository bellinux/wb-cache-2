2500|$|To {{build the}} high banking, crews had to {{excavate}} {{over a million}} square yards of soil from the track's infield. Because of the high water table in the area, the <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> filled with water to form what {{is now known as}} Lake Lloyd, named after Joseph [...] "Sax" [...] Lloyd, one of the original six members of the Daytona Beach Speedway Authority. (The lake would be stocked with 65,000 fish, and France would arrange speedboat races on it.) 22 tons of lime mortar had to be brought in to form the track's binding base, over which asphalt would be laid. Because of the extreme degree of banking, Moneypenny {{had to come up with}} a way to pave the incline. He connected the paving equipment to bulldozers anchored at the top of the banking. This would allow the paving equipment to pave the banking without slipping or rolling down the incline. Moneypenny subsequently patented his construction method and later designed Talladega Superspeedway and Michigan International Speedway. By December 1958, France had begun to run out of money and started relying on race ticket sales to complete construction.|$|E

Where possible, an area of rotten wood surrounded by sound timber is used. Where trees are in short supply, the gilded flicker and ladder-backed woodpecker <b>excavate</b> <b>holes</b> in cactus and the Andean flicker and ground woodpecker dig holes in earth banks. The campo flicker sometimes chooses termite mounds, the rufous woodpecker prefers to use ants nests in trees and the bamboo woodpecker specialises in bamboos.

Females lay from three to 12 eggs in a previously <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> 6-8 in (15-20 cm) deep, and then depart.|$|E
5000|$|Deep cement mixing {{involves}} first extracting {{soil from}} the ground into which binder material is later to be injected. Typically this is done with an auger type machine in order to penetrate deeply but narrowly into the soil. Upon reaching the required depth, cement or sometimes another binder material is being injected into the <b>excavated</b> <b>hole.</b> As the soil is soft, the binder material mixes with the soil diffusing back into the <b>excavated</b> <b>hole,</b> so {{it is important to}} choose a binder material appropriate for the specific soil, although {{in the vast majority of}} cases, cement works well. As the cement-soil mix begins to harden, further cement is added on top of the growing column until the column reaches all the way up to the start. During this process further excavation of the diffusing soil may be required. Finally the machinery is moved to the location of the next column where the process is repeated in order to form another column. Once fully hardened these columns are then able to bear much higher loads than the seabed (when using the technique to reclaim land) or the typically soft soil upon which one wants to build.|$|E

Construction started on the site of an old yeast manufacturing plant, but progress was slow and the developers had gone into receivership by the end of 2009. In May 2010 receivers signed a conditional contract with Innovus; this bid failed due diligence and Soho Square was back on the market in August 2010. In 2011 the site was purchased by Progressive Enterprises with a plan to open a supermarket, an underground carpark, and other retail shops.

50|$|The {{lake was}} created from 1912 when {{aggregate}} was excavated; {{according to the}} German Wikipedia entry, this was for what are now Bundesautobahn 4 (Aachen-Cologne) and Bundesautobahn 3 (Krefeld-Cologne), {{but according to a}} newspaper article from 1935, the fill was used for work on the railway line from Aachen to Cologne (which was indeed widened to four tracks from 1912 onwards). With the river Rhine nearby, the <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> quickly filled with water. From the 1930s onwards, people came to the lake to swim while excavations were still going on. In 1967, the lakes were officially turned into a recreation area. A total of seven lakes are interconnected, all grouped around a central rowing facility. The various lakes have different purposes: one is for swimming and diving, one for fishing, one for windsurfing, and three for swimming and boating, and one for rowing.|$|E
5000|$|The site at 2nd Avenue and Pine Street was {{originally}} proposed for a 240 ft residential tower developed by Paul Brenneke {{and planned to}} break ground in 2006.

40|$|Experiments, analyses, and {{simulations}} {{have shown}} that the engine exhaust plume of a Mars lander large enough for human spaceflight will create a deep crater in the martian soil, blowing ejecta to approximately 1 km distance, damaging the bottom of the lander with high-momentum rock impacts, and possibly tilting the lander as the <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> collapses to become a broad residual crater upon engine cutoff. Because of this, we deem that we will not have adequate safety margins to land humans on Mars unless we robotically stabilize the soil to form in situ landing pads prior to the mission. It will take a significant amount of time working in a harsh off-planet environment to develop and certify the new technologies and procedures for in situ landing pad construction.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a comparison of}} reactor and power conversion design options for 50 kWe class lunar and Mars surface power applications with scaling from 25 to 200 kWe. Design concepts and integration approaches are provided for three reactor-converter combinations: gas-cooled Brayton, liquid-metal Stirling, and liquid-metal thermoelectric. The study examines the mass and performance of low temperature, stainless steel based reactors and higher temperature refractory reactors. The preferred system implementation approach uses crew-assisted assembly and in-situ radiation shielding via installation of the reactor in an <b>excavated</b> <b>hole.</b> As an alternative, self-deployable system concepts that use earth-delivered, on-board radiation shielding are evaluated. The analyses indicate that among the 50 kWe stainless steel reactor options, the liquid-metal Stirling system provides the lowest mass at about 5300 kg followed by the gas-cooled Brayton at 5700 kg and the liquid-metal thermoelectric at 8400 kg. The use of a higher temperature, refractory reactor favors the gas-cooled Brayton option with a system mass of about 4200 kg {{as compared to the}} Stirling and thermoelectric options at 4700 and 5600 kg, respectively.

40|$|A basic {{procedure}} for robotically constructing a manned Mars base is outlined. The research procedure {{was divided into}} three areas: environment, robotics, and habitat. The base as designed will consist of these components: two power plants, communication facilities, a habitat complex, and a hangar, a garage, recreation and manufacturing facilities. The power plants will be self-contained nuclear fission reactors placed approx. 1 km from the base for safety considerations. The base communication system will {{use a combination of}} orbiting satellites and surface relay stations. This system is necessary for robotic contact with Phobos and any future communication requirements. The habitat complex will consist of six self-contained modules: core, biosphere, science, living quarters, galley/storage, and a sick bay which will be brought from Phobos. The complex will be set into an <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> and covered with approximately 0. 5 m of sandbags to provide radiation protection for the astronauts. The recreation, hangar, garage, and manufacturing facilities will each be transformed from the four one-way landers. The complete complex will be built by autonomous, artificially intelligent robots. Robots incorporated into the design are as follows: Large Modular Construction Robots with detachable arms capable of large scale construction activities; Small Maneuverable Robotic Servicers capable of performing delicate tasks normally requiring a suited astronaut; and a trailer vehicle with modular type attachments to complete specific tasks; and finally, Mobile Autonomous Rechargeable Transporters capable of transferring air and water from the manufacturing facility to the habitat complex...|$|E
40|$|Drilled shafts are {{cylindrical}} deep foundations {{constructed by}} casting fluid concrete into an <b>excavated</b> <b>hole.</b> These elements rely largely on side shear resistance generated by their substantial diameters and lengths to effectively transfer loads. Therefore, an exceptional concrete to soil interface {{is essential for}} proper performance of these structures. The FDOT preferred stabilization fluid, bentonite slurry, has been proven to degrade this interface with increased exposure time due to filter cake formation. For this reason, slurry exposure time has been limited to 36 hours by FDOT. Alternately, polymer slurries do not form a filter cake but rather stabilize excavations through continuous soil infiltration and the associated cohesion that accompanies the slurry presence. As polymer slurry use is relatively new {{to the state of}} Florida, FDOT does not presently have clear specifications regarding polymer exposure time limits. Hence, this thesis presents the results of pullout tests performed on 1 / 10 th scale drilled shafts constructed with both polymer and bentonite slurries and with varying exposure times. To explore the effect of exposure time on side shear resistance, 24 - 4 in diameter 8 ft long shafts were constructed: 6 with bentonite and 18 with three different polymer products (6 each). After being exposed to the respective slurry for 0, 1, 2, 4, 8 or 24 hours, each <b>excavated</b> <b>hole</b> was concreted and tested after 7 days of curing. Pullout tests served as a direct measure of side shear resistance due to the absence of base resistance associated with compression testing. After testing, shafts were exhumed and sectioned for filter cake measurement. As expected, shafts constructed using bentonite slurries immediately exhibited a decrease in capacity with increased exposure time. Between 0 and 24 hours a 34 % reduction in capacity was witnessed. These reductions were attributed to filter cake thickness which increased with exposure time along with the reduction in effective shaft. After 4 hours of exposure, side shear resistance for the bentonite shafts approached an asymptote, likely defined by the strength of the filter cake formed. The side shear resistance of all polymer shafts exceeded that of the 24 hr bentonite control shaft by 20 - 50 percent depending on the polymer product used. For a given polymer product no capacity reduction was noted with respect to time. Inspection of exhumed shafts revealed the formation of a soil cake (region of stabilized soil stuck to the shaft) {{around the perimeter of the}} polymer shafts. Therefore, the side shear resistance of the polymer shafts was defined by the soil-to-soil interface surrounding the shaft and not by an intermediate filter cake. The study resulted in the following findings: (1) open excavations using polymer slurry stabilization are not adversely affected by extended exposure time, (2) the effect of filter cake formation in bentonite supported excavations slows with time whereby no significant degradation in capacity was noted after 8 hours, (3) shafts constructed with polymer slurry performed better than those constructed with bentonite, and (4) as polymer slurry flow into the surrounding soil does not slow with time, more slurry volume is required (compared with bentonite) and slurry level must be continuously maintained...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. Measurement of soil {{compaction}} caused by vehicle loading {{is difficult and}} often subject to extreme variability. Two types of soil transducers were compared in an experiment conducted in a Norfolk sandy loam soil in the USDA-ARS National Soil Dynamics Laboratory’s (NSDL) soil bin facilities. Stress-state transducers (SSTs), electronic transducers developed at the NSDL for measuring six directional pressures and determining the stress state, were used for this experiment. Rubber bulbs connected by a rubber hose to a dial pressure gauge, which measure hydrostatic pressure, were also used in this experiment. Both transducers were buried at depths of 7. 5, 15, or 23 cm and were used to measure soil pressures caused by a 30. 5 L- 32 tire with dynamic loads of 19 or 37 kN. The SSTs were buried by inserting them into an <b>excavated</b> <b>hole,</b> while the rubber bulbs were inserted with a special tool designed to leave the soil surface and surrounding soil undisturbed. Peak values of mean normal stress (calculated from measurements of pressure) from the SSTs and hydrostatic pressure measured with the rubber bulbs {{were found to be}} affected by both loading and burial depth. Similar magnitudes and variation were observed for each transducer. Residual pressure, defined as the pressure remaining after loading was removed, was found to be affected by both loading and burial depth when measured with the rubber bulbs. Continued development and testing of the rubber bulb transducers could provide a simple method of determining levels of compaction that could damage soils an...|$|E
