60|$|There {{are far too}} few {{harbours}} {{of refuge}} on our exposed coasts; the consequence is that our fishing-boats are caught by the storm and wrecked, and not unfrequently {{as many as a}} hundred lives are lost in a few hours: Who is to blame? A large vessel goes on the rocks because there is no lighthouse there to give warning of danger; a post has been neglected and the enemy has crept in: Who neglected that post? After the ship has got on the rocks, it is made known to the horrified passengers that there are no ship's lifeboats aboard, neither are there any life-belts: Whose blame <b>is</b> <b>that?</b> <b>Still</b> there seems hope, for the shore is not far off, and anxious people line it; but no ordinary boat can live in such a sea. There is no rocket apparatus on this part of the coast; no mortar apparatus by which a line might be sent on board: Why not? The nearest lifeboat station is fifteen miles off: Whose fault is that? Is the storm our enemy here? Is not selfish, calculating, miserly man his own enemy in this case? So the ship goes to pieces, and {{the result is that the}} loss of this single vessel makes 60 widows and 150 fatherless children in one night! not to speak of thousands of pounds' worth of property lost to the nation.|$|E
6000|$|And it must {{be remembered}} when we {{consider}} Socialism's early extravagancies, that any idea or system of ideas which challenges the existing system is necessarily, in relation to that system, outcast. Mediocre men go soberly on the highroads, but saints and scoundrels meet in the gaols. If A and B rebel against the Government, they are apt, although they rebel for widely different reasons, to be classed together; they are apt indeed to be thrown together and tempted to sink even quite essential differences in making common cause against the enemy. So that from its very beginning Socialism was mixed up--to this day it remains mixed up--with other movements of revolt and criticism, with which it has no very natural connection. There is, for example, the unfortunate entanglement between the Socialist theory and that repudiation of any but subjective sexual limitations which is called [...] "free love," [...] and there <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> more unfortunate association of its rebellion against orthodox economic theories, with rebellion against this or that system of religious teaching. Several of the early Socialist communities, again, rebelled against ordinary clothing, and their women made short hair and bloomers the outward and visible associations of the communistic idea. In Holyoake's History of Co-operation it is stated that one early experiment was known to its neighbours as [...] "the grass-eating Atheists of Ham Common." [...] I have done my very best (in Chapter VIII., § 2) to clear the exposition of Socialism from these entanglements, but it is well to recognize that these are no corruptions of its teaching, but an inevitable birth-infection that has still to be completely overcome.|$|E

6000|$|I recall {{with perfect}} ease {{the idea in}} which [...] "The Awkward Age" [...] had its origin, but re-perusal gives me pause in respect to naming it. This composition, as it stands, makes, to my vision--and will have made perhaps still more to that of its readers--so {{considerable}} a mass beside the germ sunk in it and still possibly distinguishable, that I am half-moved to leave my small secret undivulged. I shall encounter, I think, {{in the course of}} this copious commentary, no better example, and none on behalf of which I shall venture to invite more interest, of the quite incalculable tendency of a mere grain of subject-matter to expand and develop and cover the ground when conditions happen to favour it. I say all, surely, when I speak of the thing as planned, in perfect good faith, for brevity, for levity, for simplicity, for jocosity, in fine, and for an accommodating irony. I invoked, for my protection, the spirit of the lightest comedy, but [...] "The Awkward Age" [...] was to belong, in the event, to a group of productions, here re-introduced, which have in common, to their author's eyes, the endearing sign that they asserted in each case an unforeseen principle of growth. They were projected as small things, yet had finally to be provided for as comparative monsters. That is my own title for them, though I should perhaps resent it if applied by another critic--above all in the case of the piece before us, the careful measure of which I have just freshly taken. The result of this consideration has been in the first place to render sharp for me again the interest of the whole process thus illustrated, and in the second quite to place me on unexpectedly good terms with the work itself. As I scan my list I encounter none the [...] "history" [...] of which embodies a greater number of curious truths--or of truths at least by which I find contemplation more enlivened. The thing done and dismissed has ever, at the best, for the ambitious workman, a trick of looking dead, if not buried, so that he almost throbs with ecstasy when, on an anxious review, the flush of life reappears. It is verily on recognising that flush on a whole side of [...] "The Awkward Age" [...] that I brand it all, but ever so tenderly, as monstrous--which is but my way of noting the QUANTITY of finish it stows away. Since I speak so undauntedly, when need is, of the value of composition, I shall not beat about the bush to claim for these pages the maximum of that advantage. If such a feat be possible in this field as really taking a lesson from one's own adventure I feel I have now not failed of it--to so much more demonstration of my profit than I can hope to carry through do I find myself urged. Thus it <b>is</b> <b>that,</b> <b>still</b> with a remnant of self-respect, or at least of sanity, one may turn to complacency, one may linger with pride. Let my pride provoke a frown till I justify it; which--though with more matters to be noted here than I have room for I shall accordingly proceed to do.|$|E

When Brenna woke up, the dream faded, which frustrated her day-by-day as well. Waking up from the dream and {{trying to find a way}} to note it down, Brenna suddenly finds a crystal ball holding a man who has appeared in her dreams, and he insists her on finding a little girl named Lyra. Bewildered and confused, Brenna follows the strange man's guide, as she feels that she can trust him. Brenna is led to a strange house, whose is herbalist, through the Nexus gateway. After concocting a memory recovery potion, Brenna remembers everything: herself as Faye, her husband Fidget, her missing daughter Lyra, and her family's rival: the Fairy Queen of Dreams, Lilith. Faye quickly goes on her way to rescue Lyra by following the clues left for her by an anonymous. In order to open new areas in the Fairy Realm, Faye needs to forge more Dream Jewels, which leads her to an area called the Forging Area. Then she acknowledges that Lilith is hiding in her underwater retreat. On the way finding an amulet to unleash the cliffside elevator's power that could help reaching Lilith's retreat, Faye returns to her home in the Town of Wish for the first time ever since the first journey. The familiarity <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> no one besides her, but this time the house is full of dust. As Faye feels more closer to Lyra, she encourages herself to keep going on.|$|E
50|$|Up to {{the twelfth}} century {{the windows of the}} Romesque churches had small {{openings}} for light, a sloping intrados, and an inclined sill. Originally without decoration, they later received a framework, that is, they were surrounded by a border of slender shafts as by a frame. In the further development these round shafts received small bases and capitals, the intrados was divided into rectangular intervals in which small columns were set. Gothic art adopted this framework, merely changing the round arch into a pointed one, and later replacing the rectangular intervals of the intrados by flutings. As the style grew the small capitals of the round shafts were abandoned and later the shafts themselves, by which the style returned to the simple framework. The late Gothic ceased to use even the framework and employed the sloping intrados alone, without further ornament. Naturally there were innumerable exceptions to the development sketched here only in its general features. In Romanesque art the sills had originally only a slight inclination. This gradually became greater until it became more than a right angle. Characteristic of the Romanesque style is the grouping together of two to four windows, the so-called clustered window. Above the window the flat surface of the arch remained without ornamentation or was pierced by small round windows. Romanesque art used, in addition to windows enclosed by the round arch, others surrounded by the trefoil or fan-arch, and even openings for light entirely Baroque in design with arbitrarily curved arches. In the Gothic period the windows were longer and broader, in a number of cathedrals they almost replace the walls. Although the clustered window with three openings did not entirely disappear, yet it was more customary to use two narrow windows combined by a common shaft and a common pointed arch above them. The shafts grew constantly more slender and a circular arch was introduced under the pointed arch. This led in the course of time to the appearance of tracery which was so largely used in window ornamentation in the Gothic period that it became almost the most important consideration in the construction of windows. Tracery is formed by setting together separate parts of a circle called foils; their points of contact are named cusps. By means of tracery the pointed arches of the windows were constantly filled with new forms and devices, simple in the early Gothic, artificial and confused the more the style developed, until finally in the late Gothic or Flamboyant style the wavy tracery was used which no longer consisted of circles and segments of circles but assumed forms comparable to flames, a style particularly in vogue in England and France. Towards the end of the Gothic period greater sobriety of form came into use and tracery began to decline. The elaboration undergone by the tracery was also shared by the shafts of the windows and intrados. Undivided at first they gradually received richer contours and were separated into main and subordinate pillars. The earliest tracery of which the date is known <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> existing in the choir chapels of the Reims Cathedral (1211).|$|E

In addition, digital processors offer extra features, e. g. communication protocols, software protections, and so on. Therefore, this study has an increasing practical interest.

It is a matter, therefore, of taboos and of which taboos {{can and should be}} justified, when it’s a question of not abandoning the basic principles of modernity to erosion. An almost ebullient cultural criticism, which declares the concepts human being, humanity, freedom, individuality to be Western mechanisms of repression, argues and criticizes within the horizon of a stable economic-technical civilization and society whose existence was never called into question. But <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>still</b> the case? In the face of the new world risks will not the reflexivity of a modernity vehemently calling itself into question necessarily also become aware of its own limits? At issue is the problem of a self-limitation of modernity: How are post-traditional, reflexive taboos made possible? Modernity must become aware of its own threatened modernity, of its own sacredness, which also involves the question of a transcendental horizon...|$|E
