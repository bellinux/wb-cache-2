The body officially came into existence in April 1991, and undertook its first major task in 1992 when it began reviewing the state of legal education in England and Wales. After two consultation papers in 1994 it published a pair of full reports in 1995, titled Access to and participation in undergraduate legal education and Funding legal education.

40|$|This article {{analyses}} {{the regulatory}} handbooks {{produced by the}} new regulators <b>for</b> <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers,</b> the main legal professions in England and Wales, following the Legal Services Act 2007. It focuses on the new codes of conduct and the 10 high-level regulatory standards that are a feature of each handbook. The article examines {{the ways in which}} key interests have been dealt with in the handbooks {{from the perspective of the}} historical narratives of the legal professions and their publications, including their previous codes of conduct. It is found that the barristers’ and solicitors’ codes project different ethical orientations towards the supposedly universal ‘standard conception of the lawyer’s role’ based on the principles of neutrality and partisanship. The origins, meaning and significance of the high-level standards are considered. They are found not to reflect the content of the codes of conduct or to communicate cherished elements of the professions’ historical narratives. It is argued that this is problematic in terms of the professional functions of regulation, education and communication...|$|E

50|$|Many {{professional}} degrees span {{teaching at}} bachelor's and master's level, {{leading to a}} master's level award. This includes older degrees that retain the names of bachelor's degrees for historic reasons, e.g. the Bachelor of Medicine, Bachelor of Surgery (MBBS, MBBCh, etc.), Bachelor of Dental Surgery (BDS) and Bachelor of Veterinary Science (BVS), and newer integrated master's degrees such as the Master of Engineering (MEng) or Master of Pharmacy (MPharm). In some subjects, qualification can be via separate bachelor's and master's degrees, e.g. a Bachelor of Engineering (BEng) followed by a Master of Science (MSc) in Engineering, or a Bachelor of Arts (BA) or Bachelor of Science (BSc) in Architecture followed by a year of professional experience, then a two-year Master of Architecture (MArch). In some subjects the normal professional degree is a bachelor's degree, e.g. the Bachelor of Laws (LLB) or BA in Law (<b>for</b> both <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers)</b> or a BSc in Surveying. Some professional bodies also offer different levels of professional recognition, e.g. a master's degree is needed for Chartered Engineers or Chartered Scientists but a bachelor's degree for Incorporated Engineers and a bachelor's or foundation degree for Registered Scientists.|$|R
40|$|Professional Responsibility and Legal Ethics in Queensland {{offers a}} proven, {{practical}} approach to identifying and resolving ethical issues that may arise in daily legal practice in Queensland. It {{is an excellent}} resource for practitioners and students alike who need to navigate relevant legislation and understand legal ethics through accessible, problem-based scenarios. The introduction of the Australian <b>Solicitors</b> Conduct Rules <b>and</b> Barristers’ Rule 2011, and changes to enforcement mechanisms where breaches have occurred, make the Second Edition essential reading <b>for</b> <b>solicitors,</b> <b>barristers</b> <b>and</b> law students in Queensland. Diverse practice structures, {{the enactment of the}} new rules, and other legislative developments will affect lawyers’ work and the way they must interact with their clients, {{with each other and with}} the court. Providing detailed explanation and analysis of these changes, the authors explain the ethical and regulatory environment for Queensland lawyers as the national legal services market continues to evolve. ...|$|R
40|$|The legal {{profession}} in England and Wales {{has a long}} established approach to the regulation of lawyers’ behaviour. This is built on investigation and prosecution of disciplinary breaches by the professional bodies, with more serious cases being brought before disciplinary tribunals. These tribunals have wide disciplinary powers, including the ultimate sanction of striking off or disbarring offenders or re-admitting offenders {{after a period of}} time. The establishment of the Legal Services Board (LSB), with regulatory oversight for the {{legal profession}}s, by the Legal Services Act 2007 focused attention on approaches to regulation and led to a switch in the emphasis of regulation from the individual to firms (or ‘entities’). The appointment of independent regulators of the professions suggested that there might be significant changes in regulatory philosophy and strategy. The Solicitors Regulation Authority (SRA) acquired powers to administer small fines on individual solicitors. It also promised to practise ‘risk based regulation’. It adopted a system of ‘outcomes focused regulation’ (OFR) based on a structure of auditing systems and processes. It was anticipated that these changes would drive changes in professional regulation. This research establishes a baseline for assessing these changes. It locates the work of the disciplinary tribunals <b>for</b> <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers</b> in the wider context of legal services regulation. It then provides a detailed analysis of all the disciplinary tribunal cases for the main legal professions heard in 2008. This analysis focuses on processes of investigation and prosecution, on the characteristics of respondents before the disciplinary tribunals, such as age, sex and institutional affiliations, the processing of cases and the imposition of sanctions...|$|E
5000|$|In England and Wales, {{one does}} not have to be {{admitted}} to the bar to practice law, but qualifications are required to become a solicitor or barrister, both of whom are qualified lawyers and have special rights of audience in law courts. <b>For</b> both the <b>solicitor</b> <b>and</b> <b>barrister</b> professions, one must either obtain an undergraduate law degree (LL.B., which typically lasts three years), or complete the Common Professional Examination/Graduate Diploma in Law (which lasts one year after completing an undergraduate degree). Potential barristers must complete the Bar Professional Training Course (formerly Bar Vocational Course), followed by a year of vocational training known as a pupillage and be member of the four prestigious Inns of Court. Potential solicitors are required to complete the Legal Practice Course which lasts one year, then a two-year apprenticeship under a training contract, during which the trainee solicitor has to complete a Professional Skills Course. There are legal executives, whose primary role is to provide assistance to solicitors in law firms. Legal executives may charge for works done for both contentious and non-contentious matters, but should not be confused with qualified lawyers (i.e. <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers).</b> [...] <b>Solicitors</b> Regulation Authority.

40|$|The present {{research}} is a contribution towards understanding Australian lawyers’ experiences of, and attitudes towards, depression. It was found that, like Australian law students, <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers</b> exhibited {{significantly higher levels}} of psychological distress than did members of the general population and that experiences of depression were disproportionately high. The research also found that many lawyers had low expectations about the efficacy of consulting mental health professionals, but that rates of help-seeking were nonetheless surprisingly high. Participants’ own attitudes towards people with depression were complex and varied but there was strong agreement that discrimination was likely to arise against people with depression in their workplaces. These results are discussed {{within the context of the}} kinds of strategies that legal professional bodies might adopt in order to increase awareness of the commonality of depression amongst <b>solicitors</b> <b>and</b> <b>barristers</b> <b>and</b> to provide support and treatment for those upon whom it impacts. 29 page(s...|$|R
