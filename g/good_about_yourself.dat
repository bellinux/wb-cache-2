Whatever it is, whether it's in jeans and a t-shirt, or someone else's shirt. Just something that makes you feel beautiful and sexy." [...] —Gomez on the music video's concept The accompanying music video for [...] "Good for You" [...] was directed by Sophie Muller. In the video, Gomez wanted to represent her journey to womanhood and to promote female empowerment — which she felt strongly about and wanted to depict in a raw and vulnerable way. With the clip, she wanted to prove that young women should not be self-conscious of their sex appeal or be obliged to wear lingerie to feel attractive. [...] "I feel like people here, especially guys are like, 'Ah, lingerie and sexy.' I think being sexy as a young woman or girl, is not caring what other people think, wearing like casual things, feeling sexy". The singer felt it was important to collaborate with a female director as a means of female empowerment and wanted the visual to be raw and vulnerable. She was also drawn to jeans and T-shirt attire and believed it would prove to women that they need not dress in lingerie to feel attractive. She chose the video to be specifically about her, absent of a {{love interest}} or men, to reflect the song's meaning of female self-empowerment. She later said Muller [...] "created a beautiful and intimate visual representation" [...] of [...] "Good for You". Speaking of the music video's theme, Gomez stated, [...] "It's very jeans and a T-shirt, moments where a woman is deep in thought, or in a moment where she's in this crazy little rage. It just captures real things that women do. There {{are a lot of things}} that women do that are sexy that aren't just the typical, cheap way of being sexy." ...|$|E
