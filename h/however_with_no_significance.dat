40|$|Prospective {{cohort study}} {{performed}} to evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) changes up to 12 months postpartum of healthy women and {{its association with}} breastfeeding, contraceptive methods, amenorrhea, and body mass index (BMI). There is a trend in bone loss during the first 6 months with posterior recovery, with evidence of a protective effect of hormonal contraception. This {{study was conducted to}} evaluate bone mineral density (BMD) changes during postpartum period among healthy women and its association with breastfeeding, use of contraceptive methods, amenorrhea and body mass index (BMI). A prospective cohort study including 100 healthy women. Distal BMD was measured 7 - 10 days, 3, 6, and 12 months postpartum at the nondominant forearm using dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Data about breastfeeding duration, amenorrhea, contraceptive use and BMI were collected. Seventy-eight women had a complete set of BMD measurements. The mean duration of exclusive breastfeeding was 125. 9 (+/- 66. 6) days, with a median total lactation period of 263. 5 days. The mean duration of amenorrhea was 164. 2 (+/- 119. 2) days. BMD measurements showed a significant decrease in the distal radius, <b>however</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>significance</b> in the ultradistal radius. When considering only the nonhormonal contraceptive users, the difference at 12 months was significant. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that both BMI and contraceptive use were significantly correlated with BMD. Multiple linear regression analysis showed significant correlation of distal radius with baseline BMD at the same site, pregestational BMI, age, years of schooling and difference in BMI. For ultradistal radius, there was a significant direct correlation with its baseline BMD and pregestational BMI. There was a trend in bone loss during the first 6 months postpartum with posterior recovery. Also, hormonal contraceptive methods provided protection of bone loss. However, the long duration of breastfeeding and the follow-up were not sufficient to draw definitive conclusions on postweaning BMD conditions...|$|E
40|$|In {{the current}} study uteri from {{recently}} slaughtered mares were flushed in a seriesconnected defined pattern three times in succession. The recovered fluid was analysed for different factors. The main interest {{was to determine the}} density of uterine epithelial cells in the recovered fluid and to quantify the amount of living cells among those with the method of trypan blue staining. Both investigations haven’t been described before. Smear preparates from each flushing procedure were made with different staining methods to analyse them for their quality and various corpuscular structures in the fluid. The study demonstrates that the density of epithelial cells significantly decreased according to the sequence of flushings. In the first and second flush a significantly higher amount of cells was observed in mares during estrus compared to mares in diestrus. The amount of vital epithelial cells within all epithelial cells reached the highest value with the first of the three flushing procedures and decreased in each of the continuous two, <b>however</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>significance.</b> The time of exitus didn’t have any significant effect on the amount of vital epithelial cells. The analysis of the smear preparates revealed the fact, that each routine testing for morphological aspects, manually done by an examiner, is always subjectively influenced. Smears from same aliquots, even though equally analysed, led to partly different results among the different staining methods. The reduction of polymorphnuclear neutrophil granulocytes according to the chronology of flushing procedures though was consistently observed with significance among PAP-Quick and Diff-Quick, noticeably, but without significance under May-Grünwald-Giemsa staining. In conclusion we can say that the average value of 3, 37 ± 4, 87 vital epithelial cells in the recovered fluid seems to be low, even though references in literature don’t exist. In studies with cuts of cattle uterus the methods generate a many times higher amount of vital cells but require the excision of the uterus or euthanizing of the patient. The current studies aim was to serve as a prestudy for further investigations in the living patient. The results, including density an vital amount of epithelial cells obtained by uterine flushing can therefore be considered as a new guideline...|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{study was to determine}} the effectiveness of caries preventive measures started during pregnancy on the caries experience of first-time mothers and their infants. Eighty-one pregnant women with low social background were selected on the basis of the presence of active carious lesions and were randomly divided into control (38) and experimental (43) groups. The initial dental status (DMFS and white spot lesions) was established through clinical examination. The prophylactic measures were repeated during pregnancy and 6 and 12 months after delivery. Both groups received primary care intervention. They were instructed in relation to the etiologic factors of dental caries and received oral hygiene kits. Oral hygiene instructions were reinforced through interactive brushing. The experimental group also received antimicrobial treatment (topical application of NaF and iodine solution immediately after prophylaxis and 3 and 5 days later) and restorative care using glass ionomer cement. By the time the children were 2 years of age, 33. 3 % of the infants in the control group and 14. 7 % in the experimental group had caries activity. A significant difference in caries prevalence was observed between children with and without visible dental plaque. The mean number of tooth surfaces with carious lesions (including areas of demineralization) was higher among the children in the control group compared to the experimental group (6. 3 x 3. 2), <b>however,</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> statistical <b>significance.</b> Maternal caries increase was a significant factor influencing the caries experience of the children. These data support the evidence of an association between caries prevalence in young children and clinical (dental plaque) and maternal factors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background: Feedback usually applied as {{positive}} reinforcement {{is one of}} the most effective interventions to support learning. Corrective feedback is necessary if patient safety is compromised or ethical boundaries are touched. This observational study investigates frequency and severity of mistakes made by medical students during teaching sessions as well as the frequency and the corrective level which was applied by teachers in these situations. Teaching experience of instructors is analyzed as a potential factor. Methods: During summer term 2008, 44 teaching sessions (TS) of 50 min each, delivered by 31 clinical teachers were video-recorded. TS were part of a course in emergency medicine during the first clinical year. Teachers were physicians from traumatology, internal medicine and anaesthesiology. Analysis was performed using a standardized matrix, sorting students’ mistakes into “minor” and “major”. Reactions of teachers were classified according to four corrective levels: 0) no corrective feedback 1) minimal corrective feedback (without explanation) 2) elaborative corrective feedback (simple explanation) 3) interactive corrective feedback (interactive elaboration). We included only one video of each teacher and only those, where practical mistakes occurred. To evaluate the influence of professional experience we considered only anaesthetists. Influence of the factors „severity of mistakes“ and „professional experience of teachers“ on the corrective level was analysed using t-tests. Results: 24 TS met the inclusion criteria for the primary study question. For analysis of the influence of professional experience 18 videos could be used. In total, 78 major and 63 minor mistakes were observed (3. 3 major and 2. 6 minor mistakes per TS). •	 62. 8 % of major mistakes were addressed by teachers. They reacted upon 39. 7 % of minor mistakes. •	Average corrective level of all teachers was 1. 19 (± 0. 71 SD) for major mistakes, and 0. 69 (± 0. 79 SD) for minor mistakes; <b>no</b> statistical <b>significance</b> (p = 0. 056; t-test). •	A significant correlation between individual average corrective level of teachers and quality of their feedback could not be shown. •	For more experienced teachers the proportion of corrected mistakes and the corrective level were higher than for less experienced teachers, <b>however</b> <b>with</b> <b>no</b> statistical <b>significance</b> (correction of major mistakes: 70. 6 % ± 31. 6 % SD vs. 62. 1 % ± 32. 0 % SD; p= 0. 34; corrective level: 1. 33 ± 0. 71 SD vs. 1. 07 ± 0. 82 SD; p= 0. 537). •	An influence of the discipline of teachers could not be evaluated with the material available. Conclusion: Practical mistakes of medical students in emergency medicine courses occur regularly, but only about one half of them are addressed by teachers...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to examine the {{differences}} at quality of life and loneliness between elderly people. Data were collected from 180 persons aged 60 - 93 years old from Greece. Quality life was estimated through the Quality of Life Index, loneliness through the UCLA Loneliness Scale, and demographic characteristics with a questionnaire. For quality of life, males had higher scores than females, older than oldest old and finally married than divorced and widows/ers respectively. Further, divorced had better quality of life than widows/ers, but <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>significance.</b> Concerning loneliness, males scored lower than females, older than oldest old and married than divorced and widows/ers respectively. Divorced had lower loneliness than widowers, but <b>with</b> <b>no</b> <b>significance.</b> The internal consistency of the Quality of Life Index subscales ranged from 0. 749 to 0. 881, whereas for the UCLA Loneliness Scale was 0. 849.
