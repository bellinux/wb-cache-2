40|$|Abstract. A new finish method uses an {{effective}} electrode connecting with a nonconductive grinding tool {{to execute the}} design of compound processes of electrochemical finishing and grinding following turning is investigated. The submitted processes {{can be used for}} various turning operations. Through simple <b>equipment</b> <b>attachment,</b> electrochemical finishing and grinding can follow to execute the finishing process on the same machine. Among the factors affecting electrochemical finishing the performance of grinding combined with electrochemical finishing is primarily discussed. In the experiment, the electrode is used with continuous and pulsed direct current. The grinding tool moves following the electrode and grinds the workpiece surface. The experimental parameters are electrical current rating, feed rate of electrode and grinding tool, rotational speed of workpiecel, pulsed period, and geometry of finish-tool. The results show that pulsed direct current with longer off-time can slightly improve the finish effect for its dregs discharge mobility. Using an adequate rotational speed of workpiece with high rotational speed is advantageous to the finish effect. A thinner plate-form electrode with a smaller end radius is associated with larger discharge space and produces higher current density and provides faster feed rate and a better finish effect.

40|$|Purpose: The ultrasonic-aided {{electrochemical}} finishing following traditional turning by a turning-form electrode {{for several}} die materials is demonstrated. Design/methodology/approach: A guide {{line for the}} design process is followed a scientific method including the design requirement, design development, detail design, and experimental analysis is adopted in the current study. The proposed design of turning-form electrode combined with the ultrasonic-aided electrochemical finishing is presented. Findings: Smaller end radius and smaller declination angle are associated with higher current density and provides larger discharge space and better polishing effect. The plate-shape electrode with small end radius and decreasing the surface area of top-view performs the best. The ultrasonic assistance can avoid the difficulty of dreg discharge in the electrochemical finishing, thus increasing the finishing effect. Research limitations/implications: The potential for electrode design and using ultrasonic energy transmitted to the electrolyte to assist discharging dregs out of electrode gap during the electrochemical finishing {{is yet to be}} explored. Practical implications: This process can be used for various turning operations including end turning, form turning, and flute and thread cutting. Through simple <b>equipment</b> <b>attachment,</b> the electrochemical finishing can follow the cutting on the same machine and chuck.

40|$|Excessive {{exposure}} to crystalline silica remains {{prevalent in the}} U. S. construction industry. Chronic inhalation of respirable crystalline silica {{is associated with the}} development of progressive pulmonary fibrosis and has been implicated in the pathogenesis of lung cancer and various autoimmune diseases such as systemic sclerosis, chronic renal disease, lupus, and rheumatoid arthritis. Although the relationship between silica-containing dust and pulmonary disease has been documented for centuries, the pathways triggering a progressive and untreatable disease state remain largely unclear. Attenuation of silica-related disease is dependent upon improved methods for assessing and reducing dust exposure, but a latent exposure-response to this abundant mineral reinforces the need for better biological indicators of chronic exposure and improved knowledge of biological interactions from silica mixtures. In the most recent National Occupational Research Agenda (NORA) for Construction, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) has requested research to advance current deficiencies in hazard communication, dust control, and exposure assessment for silica exposures and related illnesses. The central purpose of this dissertation was to characterize unevaluated silica-related dust exposures and exposure controls while advancing methods for outdoor exposure assessment and communication of risk for task-based operations in roadway construction. During an exposure assessment of concrete curb cutting with a hand-held cut-off saw, wet suppression and local exhaust ventilation (LEV) control were found to significantly (p 3 ̆c 0. 001) reduce personal respirable dust exposure by + 78. 0 percent and + 73. 2 percent respectively when compared to no dust control, an exposure scenario where crystalline silica exposure was estimated to exceed the American Conference of Governmental Industrial Hygienists (ACGIH) Threshold Limit Value (TLV) by almost 40 times. Videos of these exposure control methods were presented side-by-side with real-time dust concentration to local construction supervisors followed by an anonymous survey. Supervisors answered 2 ̆ 2 yes 2 ̆ 2 on 85 percent of returned surveys when asked if they would consider changing current uncontrolled work practices {{as a result of the}} training. During an exposure assessment of asphalt grinding with a cold-planer <b>equipment</b> <b>attachment,</b> an 80 percent increase in respirable dust exposure was observed for wet suppression when compared to no dust control during matched wind conditions, identifying a unique flaw in wet control technology. A new systematic method of reporting wind condition also identified that exposure can differ significantly by more than 1000 percent across 30 degree by 400 feet per minute (fpm) wind condition categories (WCCs). Reporting outdoor exposure data using the methods developed in this assessment will allow future researchers to easily compare tool-specific exposure during specific wind conditions, ultimately improving outdoor exposure assessments and reducing selection error for dust controls. During an exposure assessment of soil stabilization with lime and cement mixtures, excessive overexposures to Portland cement and calcium oxide were identified for multiple work tasks, but simultaneous {{exposure to}} crystalline silica was either non-detectable or below the ACGIH TLV in all mixed dust samples. These same four workers evaluated in the soil stabilization assessment were individually matched with four non-exposed roadway workers by gender (male), race (Caucasian), age (± 2 years), height (± 3 in.), and pack-years (± 2. 5 pack years). The natural log of the difference in cumulative calcium exposure between each matched pair was a significant predictor (p 3 ̆c 0. 05, r 2 = 0. 98) of the natural log of the difference in sputum neutrophil count. In the context of prior research, this indicates that the neutrophils remain present during tissue repair and after inflammation subsides, providing further evidence of possible mechanisms of disease potentiation by metallic irritants co-generated with quartz. Collectively, this study advanced silica exposure assessment and control by quantifying exposure for multiple dust-generating tasks, determining the effectiveness of unevaluated tool-specific dust controls, surveying the perception of tool-specific video exposure training among construction supervisors, developing a new methodology for reporting and adjusting exposure by wind condition, and detecting a possible field-friendly biological marker of cumulative exposure for a substance that commonly accompanies silica in construction dust. ...|$|E

There were a total of 50 CROPS. demonstrators (25 in New York and 25 in Virginia), with 45 observers attending the New York CROPS demonstrations and 36 observers attending the Virginia CROPS demonstrations, for a total of 70 participants in New York and 61 in Virginia. The oldest retrofitted tractors were 77 to 62 years old, while the newest retrofitted tractors were 40 to 37 years old. The most frequently retrofitted tractor in the CROPS demonstration project was a Ford 3000 series tractor (n = 19; 38 %), followed by Ford 4000 (n = 11; 22 %), Massey Ferguson 135 (n = 11; 22 %), and Ford 8 N (n = 9; 18 %). A major issue of CROPS retrofitting was the rear wheel fenders. The effort involved in disassembling the fenders (removing the old bolts was often faster by cutting them with a torch), modifying the fender mounting brackets, and then reinstalling the fenders with the CROPS generally required the most time. In addition, various other semi-permanent <b>equipment</b> <b>attachments,</b> such as front-end loaders, required additional time and effort to fit with the CROPS. Demonstrators were asked to rank the reasons why they had not retrofitted their tractors with ROPS until they had enrolled in the CROPS demonstration program.
