40|$|Dense media {{separation}} (DMS) {{plays an}} integral part in coal processing {{as well as in}} the upgrade of low grade ore bodies prior to further processing like flotation and leaching. Various separating vessels are used in DMS; of which the dense media (DM) cyclone is the most common. However, the limited materials of construction available for DM cyclones leave the industry with little choice. In addition, the DM cyclones available moved away from the basic principles of classification hydrocyclones which is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> in order to achieve improved efficiency. The ceramic tiled DM cyclones available in the market have ceramic tiles installed perpendicular to each other in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber,</b> which increase the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> at the expense of longer equipment life. For that reason, a research project was initiated to establish the current installed base of DM cyclones in Southern Africa and to develop and evaluate a DM cyclone with a laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> design to reduce the turbulence when feeding the cyclone, whilst achieving the same or superior wear properties. Because Cavex is well proven in hard rock mining and coal classification, it was used as basis for the development of a DM cyclone. Individual moulds were developed and produced in order to fabricate a Cavex DM cyclone with the exact laminar spiral <b>feed</b> <b>chamber</b> that exists when moulded out of rubber. Afterwards, the Cavex ceramic tiled (CVXT) cyclone was manufactured, installed and commissioned. Using the basic operating principles of hydrocyclones, the predicted results were achieved. The 650 CVXT results confirmed that a DM cyclone and a classification cyclone are inherently the same piece of equipment; it is the selection criteria and material of construction that differ. There is a definite benefit in focussing on metallurgical efficiency in conjunction with wear properties, rather than equipment life (wear life) as the only parameter during equipment fabrication. A simple way to achieve improved performance is to reduce the turbulence in the <b>feed</b> <b>chamber.</b> Further work must include the evaluation of the Cavex CVXT DM cyclone in near gravity coal circuits and to investigate whether the same lower operating pressures (6 D compared to conventional 9 D) will result in improved coal yield, as was illustrated successfully in the separation of fluorspar by DMS, whilst achieving the desired ash contents.

Changes in the {{relative}} abundance of each algal species were determined in 5 -h feeding trials from <b>feeding</b> <b>chambers</b> and by gut content analyses. All age-groups rejected Scenedesmus quadricauda and preferentially selected Nannochloropsis oculata and Selenastrum capricornutum, principally {{on the basis of}} size. Changes in the relative abundance of algae in <b>feeding</b> <b>chambers</b> did not differ significantly among age-groups. Observed differences in the ingested quantities of the similar-sized N. oculata and S. capricornutum were attributed to other particle-related characteristics. Results indicate that the rainbow mussel can be fed similar-sized algae at all ages in captive propagation facilities. When developing a suitable algal diet for rearing juvenile mussels, one probably need not investigate different species at each stage of development if the algae used are in the 2. 8 – 8. 5 -mm size range. Propagation studies of native freshwater mus-sels (order Bivalvia: family Unionidae) have been used to describe much of their basic life history, including host 2 fish relationships (Neves et al. 1985; O’Connell and Neves 1999), environmental stress thresholds (Dimock and Wright 1993), and habitat and substrate use (Michaelson and Neves 1995).

Algae have been the most popular food source for captive juvenile mussels. Various combinations of algal species have been used to culture juveniles (Hud-son and Isom 1984; Gatenby et al. 1996, 1997), and because of their apparent importance in the diet of unionids, algal species have been incor-porated into the design of recirculating culture sys-tems as the primary food source (O’Beirn et al...|$|R

Immediately after the drug injections, the animals {{were placed in the}} <b>feeding</b> <b>chamber</b> and feeding and non-ingestive behaviours such as grooming, rearing, resting, sniffing and locomotion were recorded for 30 min. The results showed that both doses of PHE injected into the MnR of overnight fasted animals decreased food intake accompanied by an increase in the latency to start feeding. A reduction in feeding duration was observed only after treatment of the MnR with the 20 nmol dose of PHE. Both locomotion duration and sniffing frequency increased after injection with the highest dose PHE into the MnR. Feeding frequency and the other non-ingestive behaviours remained unchanged after PHE treatment in the MnR. Both doses of PHE injected into the MnR of food-restricted rats decreased food intake. This hypophagic response was accompanied by a decrease in feeding duration only after treatment of the MnR with the highest dose of PHE. The latency to start feeding and feeding frequency were not affected by injection of either dose of PHE into the MnR. While both doses of PHE increased sniffing duration, the highest dose of PHE increased resting duration and resting frequency.

40|$|The {{green peach aphid}} (GPA), Myzus persicae (Hemiptera: Aphidae), is a {{polyphagous}} insect that feeds on {{a broad range of}} more than forty different plant families and also vectors over one hundred plant viruses. Feeding damage, and viral diseases that they transmit, contribute to yield losses in many economically important crops worldwide. The current measures used to control GPAs include genetic resistance and the application of insecticides. Although chemical insecticides provide control and are widely used for managing aphid infestations, they are expensive and some are not environmentally safe. Moreover, insecticides are not always effective because GPAs readily develop resistance. An alternate approach is to exploit the naturally occurring eukaryotic phenomenon of RNA interference (RNAi) to silence vital genes of aphids. RNAi is the sequence-specific degradation of homologous RNA molecules guided by small RNAs and can be triggered by the introduction of double-stranded RNA (dsRNA). This approach is environmentally-friendly, appears to be an effective strategy to silence vital genes of plant pathogens and pests such as nematodes and insects, and could be a competitive alternative to current methods of pest control. However, to develop transgenic plants expressing GPA genes, first suitable gene targets have to be identified and tested for their effects on aphid survival and reproduction through RNAi. Hence, the aims of this research were to identify essential genes of GPAs and to investigate the effects of gene silencing by artificial feeding of dsRNA and delivery of dsRNA through transgenic plants. Comparative bioinformatics was undertaken for in silico identification of candidate genes of GPA. Six putative functional classes: embryogenesis, osmoregulation, moulting, cuticularisation, feeding, and locomotion were identified based on the life-cycle of GPA. All available expressed sequence tags (ESTs) of GPA were compared to the genomic resources of the free-living nematode, Caenorhabditis elegans to identify genes belonging to the putative functional class and also having lethal RNAi phenotypes. In this way, GPA orthologues of C. elegans genes with an RNAi phenotype belonging to the six putative functional classes were identified and also compared to nucleotide sequences of other insects to identify genes with known or predicted functions. Fifty target genes were identified in silico of which ten were then used for molecular characterisation and RNAi studies. The ten genes chosen for detailed study were named with a prefix Mp representing Myzus persicae and were: MpVha- 8 (vacuolar H+ ATPase), MpEat- 6 (EATing: abnormal pharyngeal pumping), MpCct- 6 (Chaperonin Containing TCP- 1), MpLev- 11 (LEVamisole resistant; tmy- 1), MpSox- 2 (alternative splicing transcription factors), MpTnc- 2 (Troponin C), MpAqp- 4 (aquaporin or aquaglyceroporin related), MpPdi- 2 (protein disulphide isomerase), MpPod- 2 (polarity and osmotic sensitivity defect), and MpCars- 1 (cysteinyl amino-acyl tRNA synthetase).

The retentate is the remainder of the feed leaving the membrane <b>feed</b> <b>chamber,</b> which is not permeated through the membrane. The chemical potential can be expressed in terms of fugacity, given by Raoult's law for a liquid and by Dalton's law for (an ideal) gas. During operation, due to removal of the vapor-phase permeate, the actual fugacity of the vapor is lower than anticipated on basis of the collected (condensed) permeate. Separation of components (e.g. water and ethanol) is based on a difference in transport rate of individual components through the membrane. This transport mechanism can be described using the solution-diffusion model, based on the rate/ degree of dissolution of a component into the membrane and its velocity of transport (expressed in terms of diffusivity) through the membrane, which will be different for each component and membrane type leading to separation.|$|R

Fleas feeding on cats anesthetized with xylazine/ketamine or ketamine/halothane combinations consumed a volume of blood that was similar to those fleas that fed on manually restrained cats. ^ The volume of blood consumed by actively reproducing female fleas, while feeding in confinement <b>feeding</b> <b>chambers</b> for three hours, was investigated using two radionuclide blood tags (51 Cr-erythrocyte tag and 125 I-albumin tag) and the gravimetric method. One hundred actively reproducing female fleas consumed an average of 0. 110 ml (± 0. 026 ml) of blood as determined using the dual-radionuclide system. In these investigations the single 51 -Cr-erythrocyte tag overestimated blood consumption by 11. 3...|$|R

The purpose of a turbopump is to produce a high-pressure fluid for <b>feeding</b> a combustion <b>chamber</b> or other use.|$|R
5000|$|... "Can You Make Out Their Voices" [...] {{derives from}} {{a news story}} in January 1931 about tenant farmers in Arkansas, who raided a local Red Cross office to <b>feed</b> themselves. <b>Chambers</b> picked up on a common fear of the moment, namely, that this event marked the {{beginning}} of further popular uprisings in the face of drought and depression. In his story, the farmers have in their midst a quiet, dignified man—a communist—who unites them so that they take food by gunpoint, opposing the town's top businessman (a local banker, no less—a typical fat cat).|$|R
40|$|The {{spray cone}} angles {{produced}} by several simplex pressure-swirl nozzles are examined using three liquids whose viscosities range from 0. 001 to 0. 012 kg/ms (1 to 12 cp). Measurements {{of both the}} visible spray cone angle and the effective spray cone angle are carried out over wide ranges of injection pressure and for five different values of the discharge orifice length/diameter ratio. The influence {{of the number of}} swirl <b>chamber</b> <b>feed</b> slots on spray cone angle is also examined. The results show that the spray cone angle widens with increase in injection pressure but is reduced by increases in liquid viscosity and/or discharge orifice length/diameter ratio. Variation in the number of swirl <b>chamber</b> <b>feed</b> slots between one and three has little effect on the effective spray cone angle...|$|R
50|$|When {{engaged in}} combat shooting, {{sometimes}} cartridges do not <b>feed</b> into the <b>chamber</b> properly. These malfunctions must be corrected quickly so that firing can be resumed. There are variations of malfunction drills, including {{the two most}} often required in competition: clearing a cartridge that fails to fire, and clearing a double feed malfunction.|$|R
