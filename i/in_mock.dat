5|$|On February 12, 1952, Bennett married Ohio art {{student and}} jazz fan Patricia Beech, {{whom he had}} met the {{previous}} year after a nightclub performance in Cleveland. Two thousand female fans dressed in black gathered outside the ceremony at St. Patrick's Cathedral in Manhattan, New York, <b>in</b> <b>mock</b> mourning. The couple had two sons, D'Andrea (Danny, born 1954) and Daegal (Dae, born 1955).|$|E
5|$|When {{they entered}} service, the IK-3s {{suffered}} from minor equipment and instrument faults, largely caused by {{deficiencies in the}} Yugoslav aeronautical industry which had resulted {{in a mixture of}} foreign and Yugoslav-made instruments being fitted to the aircraft. The Yugoslav Minister of War approved the acquisition of a further 48 IK-3s to be delivered in 1941–42. The operational aircraft were allocated to the 51st Independent Fighter Group at Zemun, six each to the 161st Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Savo Poljanec) and the 162nd Fighter Squadron (Kapetan Todor Gogić). The IK-3 was then tested against Yugoslav Messerschmitt Bf 109Es <b>in</b> <b>mock</b> dogfights. The evaluation concluded that the IK-3 had several advantages over the Bf 109E; the Yugoslav aircraft was more manoeuvrable in level flight, enabling it to quickly get behind a pursuing Bf 109E by making tight horizontal turns.|$|E

5|$|A {{wide variety}} of {{displays}} are seen, with aggressive behaviours outnumbering pro-social ones. Crouching low and uttering quiet begging calls are common signs of submission. The manus flutter is a submissive display where a magpie will flutter its primary feathers in its wings. A magpie, particularly a juvenile, may also fall, roll over on its back and expose its underparts. Birds may fluff up their flank feathers as an aggressive display or preceding an attack. Young birds display various forms of play behaviour, either by themselves or in groups, with older birds often initiating the proceedings with juveniles. These may involve picking up, manipulating or tugging at various objects such as sticks, rocks or bits of wire, and handing them to other birds. A bird may pick up a feather or leaf and flying off with it, with other birds pursuing and attempting {{to bring down the}} leader by latching onto its tail feathers. Birds may jump on each other and even engage <b>in</b> <b>mock</b> fighting. Play may even take place with other species such as blue-faced honeyeaters and Australasian pipits.|$|E

40|$|Abridged] We {{perform on}} galaxy mock {{catalogues}} the same colour-density analysis made by Cucciati et al. (2006) on a 5 Mpc/h scale using the VVDS-Deep survey, {{and compare the}} results from mocks with observed data. We use mocks with the same flux limits (I= 24) as the VVDS (CMOCKS), built using the semi- analytic model by De Lucia & Blaizot (2007) applied to the Millennium Simulation. From CMOCKS, we extracted samples of galaxies mimicking the VVDS observational strategy (OMOCKS). We computed the B-band Luminosity Function LF and the colour-density relation (CDR) <b>in</b> the <b>mocks.</b> We find that the LF <b>in</b> <b>mocks</b> roughly agrees with the observed LF, but at z< 0. 8 the faint-end slope of the model LF is steeper than the VVDS one. Computing the LF for early and late type galaxies, we show that mocks have an excess of faint early-type and of bright late-type galaxies with respect to data. We find that the CDR in OMOCKS is in excellent agreement with the one in CMOCKS. At z~ 0. 7, the CDR <b>in</b> <b>mocks</b> agrees with the VVDS one (red galaxies reside mainly in high densities). Yet, {{the strength of the}} CDR <b>in</b> <b>mocks</b> does not vary within 0. 2 <z< 1. 5, while the observed relation flattens with increasing z and possibly inverts at z= 1. 3. We argue that the lack of evolution in the CDR <b>in</b> <b>mocks</b> is not due only to inaccurate prescriptions for satellite galaxies, but that also the treatment of central galaxies has to be revised. The reversal of the CDR can be explained by wet mergers between young galaxies, producing a starburst event. This should be seen on group scales. A residual of this is found in observations at z= 1. 5 on larger scales, but not <b>in</b> the <b>mocks,</b> suggesting that the treatment of physical processes affecting satellites and central galaxies in models should be revised.

25|$|The {{conflict}} over military flight activities {{has led to}} a practice of continuous tactical military provocations. Turkish aircraft regularly fly in the zones over which Greece claims control (i.e., the outer four miles of the claimed Greek airspace and the international parts of Athens FIR), while Greek aircraft constantly intercept them. Aircraft from both countries frequently engage <b>in</b> <b>mock</b> dog-fights. These operations often cause casualties and losses for both the Greek and Turkish Air Forces.|$|E

Three aircraft flew {{during the test}} program, and, along with two other airframes, were transferred to NASA for atmospheric testing, as the Crusader III was capable of flying above 95% of the Earth's atmosphere. NASA pilots flying at NAS Patuxent River routinely intercepted and defeated U.S. Navy Phantom IIs <b>in</b> <b>mock</b> dogfights, until complaints from the Navy {{put an end to}} the harassment.|$|E
