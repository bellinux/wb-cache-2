25|$|Their {{goal was}} to find {{experimental}} designs for investigating the dependence of some measured quantity {{on a number of}} independent variables (factors), each taking L levels, {{in such a way as}} to minimize the variance of the estimates of these dependencies using a limited number of experiments. Interactions between the factors were considered negligible. The solution to this problem is to find an experimental design where each combination of levels for any pair of factors appears the same number of times, throughout all the experimental runs (refer to table). A complete <b>factorial</b> <b>design</b> would satisfy this criterion, but the idea was to find smaller designs.|$|E
25|$|For {{the case}} of two levels (L=2), Plackett and Burman used the method found in 1933 by Raymond Paley for {{generating}} orthogonal matrices whose elements are all either 1 or −1 (Hadamard matrices). Paley's method {{could be used to}} find such matrices of size N for most N equal to a multiple of 4. In particular, it worked for all such N up to 100 except N=92. If N is a power of 2, however, the resulting design is identical to a fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>design,</b> so Plackett–Burman designs are mostly used when N is a multiple of 4 but not a power of 2 (i.e. N=12, 20, 24, 28, 36 …).

40|$|Introduction: Non-regular {{two-level}} fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs,</b> such as Plackett–Burman designs, {{are becoming}} popular choices {{in many areas}} of scientific investigation due to their run size economy and flexibility. The run size of non-regular two-level <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> is a multiple of 4. They fill the gaps left by the regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> whose run size is always a power of 2 (4, 8, 16, 32, …). In non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> each main effect is partially confounded with all the two-factor interactions not involving itself. Because of this complex aliasing structure, non-regular <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> had not received sufficient attention until recently. [...] . In practical applications of non-regular designs, it is often in the case that some of the two-factor interactions are important and need to be estimated in addition to the main effects. In this article, we consider how to select non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> when some of the two-factor interactions are presumably important. We propose and study a method to select the optimal non-regular two-level fractional <b>factorial</b> <b>designs</b> in the situation that some of the two-factor interactions are potentially important. We then discuss how to search for the best designs according to this method and present some results for the Plackett-Burman design of 12 runs...|$|R
