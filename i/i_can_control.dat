500|$|Dr.Dre {{has said}} that his primary {{instrument}} in the studio is the Akai MPC3000, a drum machine and sampler, and that he often uses {{as many as four}} or five to produce a single recording. He cites 1970s funk musicians such as George Clinton, Isaac Hayes and Curtis Mayfield as his primary musical influences. Unlike most rap producers, he tries to avoid samples as much as possible, preferring to have studio musicians re-play pieces of music he wants to use, because it allows him more flexibility to change the pieces in rhythm and tempo. In 2001 he told Time magazine, [...] "I may hear something I like on an old record that may inspire me, but I'd rather use musicians to re-create the sound or elaborate on it. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> it better." [...] Other equipment he uses include the E-mu SP-1200 drum machine and other keyboards from such manufacturers as Korg, Rhodes, Wurlitzer, Moog, and Roland. Dr. Dre also stresses the importance of equalizing drums properly, telling Scratch magazine in 2004 that he [...] "used the same drum sounds on a couple of different songs on one album before but you'd never {{be able to tell the}} difference because of the EQ." [...] Dr. Dre also uses the digital audio workstation, Pro Tools and uses the software to combine hardware drum machines and vintage analog keyboards and synthesizers.|$|E

[...] However the new management, under Keim, in fact was not keen to continue Gowen's affiliation with the company at all. [...] Following a confrontation between the two old friends, in which Gowen was told (by his own later recounting) [...] "you were not a very successful president of this company, and now other people have got hold of it; we are responsible and you are not"; Gowen's hyperbolic response eventually obtained him a position as counsel, allowing him to offer advice but make no decisions.|$|E

I would light the alien so that he looked good, but if he passed into a shadow while going down the street you could see all the seams in his make-up. So I sometimes had to block all the streets with black paper." [...] The aliens were not too different from humans, and an incorrect lighting or camera angle could give away seams in the makeup. In attempting {{to identify with the}} aliens regarding a unique look, Greenberg chose a deep blue color for filming. He said, [...] "We ended up with very deep, strong blue â€“ a sort of moonlight blue. We tried to do all the scenes in the movie that appear to be their places heavily favored by this deep blue color. The Encounters Club was one of those places." [...] Greenberg used Arriflex cameras and Zeiss lenses along with Fuji stock. Commenting on film grain he said, [...] "I figured out from tests that it is better for me to use Fuji. Once film is blown up to 70mm the grain will stand out more and Fuji has smaller grain than Kodak. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>control</b> the contrast with light, but I {{have to live with the}} grain." [...] Making use of multiple cameras, Greenberg noted, [...] "Photographically, of course, one camera is best. But as a movie maker, and because I want the film to be a success, I realize that the photography is not the most important thing. The whole movie is most important. So in pre-production, I was the one pushing the director to always shoot with two or three cameras." ...|$|E

It is not impossible that something similar to what they related to me really happened when the early Portuguese discoverers first came to Aru, and has formed the foundation for a continually increasing accumulation of legend and fable. I have no doubt that to the next generation, or even before, I myself shall be transformed into a magician or a demigod, a worker of miracles, and a being of supernatural knowledge. They already believe that all the animals I preserve will come to life again; and to their children it will be related that they actually did so.

30|$|During Mtb infection, {{multiple}} {{molecules and}} their associated signaling pathways in macrophages {{are involved in}} the regulation of cellular fates of host cells. After being inhaled, Mtb can bind to phagocytic receptors and enters resident alveolar macrophages recruited from the bloodstream (Bhatt and Salgame, 2007). Macrophages also express Toll-like receptors (TLRs) that recognize conserved pathogen-associated-molecular patterns (PAMPs) on Mtb to mediate the production of cytokinesÂ such as tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and type I Interferons (IFNs) (Bhatt and Salgame, 2007; Hayashi et al., 2001; Killick et al., 2013). TNF can induce both apoptosis and necroptosis. Type <b>I</b> IFNs <b>can</b> <b>control</b> Mtb growth as well as cause damage to host cells by induction of either apoptosis or necroptosis. In addition, accumulating studies have shown that Vitamin D plays a vital role in host defense against Mtb by regulating innate immunity in human macrophages, mainly through induction of cathelicidin and autophagy (Liu et al., 2006; Shin et al., 2010).|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} three essays in experimental economics. The essays investigate different aspects of reputation in fairness games in a controlled laboratory environment. It {{has been established in}} the literature of economics, sociology, and psychology that social norms together with other-regarding preferences often govern subjects' decisions in addition to strategic considerations. The dissertation examines the incentives connected with the existence of social norms that could cause deviations from standard economic model predictions. I use experiments so that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> tightly <b>control</b> the environment and provide rigorous tests of existing theories, stylized facts, and anecdotal evidence on the importance of reputation in economic interactions. The first essay presents findings that reputation triggers indirectly reciprocal behavior of subjects. However, reputation might only be signaling what is considered as socially appropriate behavior. This hypothesis and the results of the first essay led me to develop a set of experiments in the second essay to contrast pure reputation effects with the social influence of reputation. The third part of the dissertation, co-authored with Ninghua Du, examines reputation and efficiency wages in a labor market setting by analyzing the effects of negative technological shocks on long run relationships between firms and workers...|$|R

40|$|The {{first step}} in {{developing}} a geometric language that combines physical and digital processes: sketching with a mechanical pencil. With every sketch I consider the erasure markings, the horizontal or vertical composition, the intensity of each shape or line, the simplicity or complexity of each design, and the symmetry each design {{may or may not}} have. My designs reflect the influence of abstract artists such as Wassily Kandinsky and Kazimir Malevich in addition to Bauhaus artists such as Josef Albers and Paul Klee. The second step is to bring these sketches into Adobe Illustrator software, because it allows for the precision I am looking for in my work. Moreover, in Illustrator <b>I</b> <b>can</b> adjust each line or shape to establish a hierarchy of conversation. <b>I</b> <b>can</b> also <b>control</b> the path of a certain mark, twisting and turning, to produce either an exact geometry or a distorted form. When this stage is finished, I incorporate color. In each piece, the geometrical figure is illuminated with a bright color on a dark contrasting background. This brings forth the geometry, but also gives the composition a sense of depth in space. My designs are playful and possess an animated mood that flows within the rectangular space. With each design there is a balance between expansion and contraction and the combination of these two forces produces a geometrical pattern that is distinctive and transformative. In my work I manipulate and organize shapes that together bring about a fluidity of motion. This is the realm within which I make my greatest artistic impression...|$|R
