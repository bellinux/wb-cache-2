5000|$|An {{important}} difference between lasso regression and Tikhonov regularization is that lasso regression forces more <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> [...] to actually equal 0 than would otherwise. In contrast, while Tikhonov regularization forces <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> [...] to be small, {{it does not}} force more {{of them to be}} 0 than would be otherwise. Thus, LASSO regularization is more appropriate than Tikhonov regularization in cases in which we expect the number <b>of</b> non-zero <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> [...] to be small, and Tikhonov regularization is more appropriate when we expect that <b>entries</b> <b>of</b> [...] will generally be small but not necessarily zero.

5|$|Gernot Klepper, in an {{analysis}} similar to Krugman and Baldwin, has also used the Brander Spencer and other models to analyze the effects of entry into the transport aircraft industry. He included the effects of learning during the production process which depends {{on the scale of}} production. His calibrated model suggested that per unit production costs can fall by as much as 20% if total production is doubled. In that case, the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> another firm (in this case, Airbus) into the market would decrease per firm output and reduce the learning and scale effects. In his analysis, the <b>entry</b> <b>of</b> Airbus would cause an increase in consumer surplus, but this would be smaller than the resulting loss in producer surplus.|$|E
