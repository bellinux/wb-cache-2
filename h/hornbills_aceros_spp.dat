40|$|The {{occurrence}} of a coccidian parasite, Cryptosporidium, among {{birds in the}} Kuala Lumpur National Zoo was investigated in this study. A hundred bird fecal samples were taken from various locations of the zoo. Fecal smears prepared using direct smear and formalin ethyl acetate concentration technique were stained with modified Ziehl-Neelsen stain. Samples positive for Cryptosporidium with Ziehl-Neelsen stain were later confirmed using the immunofluorescence technique and viewed under the epifluorescence microscope. Six species of bird feces were confirmed positive with Cryptosporidium oocysts. They included Wrinkled <b>Hornbill</b> (<b>Aceros</b> corrugatus), Great Argus Pheasant (Argusianus argus), Black Swan (Cygnus atratus), Swan Goose (Anser cygnoides), Marabou Stork (Leptoptilos crumeniferus), and Moluccan Cockatoo (Cacatua moluccencis). These birds were located in the aviary and lake, with the Moluccan Cockatoo routinely used as a show bird. Results obtained in this study indicated that animal sanctuaries like zoos and bird parks are important sources of Cryptosporidium infection to humans, especially children and other animals...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out at the Malaysian National Zoo to ascertain, not only the current {{prevalence}} rate in the birds, but also to determine the association between cryptosporidiosis in birds and the bird handlers. A total of 116 fecal samples from 71 species of birds were collected from six different locations in Zoo Negara, and eight fecal samples from bird handlers were also sampled. Results showed that the prevalence of Cryptosporidium oocysts in birds and bird handlers were 3. 4 and 12. 5, respectively. The birds that were positive for cryptosporidiosis were Wreathed <b>Hornbill</b> (<b>Aceros</b> undulatus) and Great Currasow (Crax rubra) from the aviary, Bushy-crested Hornbill (Anorrhinus galeritus) from the bird house, and the Common Peafowl (Pavo cristatus) from the lake. Birds at the lake showed the highest percentage (12. 5) of positivity, followed by birds at the aviary (5. 4) and the birdhouse (2. 8). Result {{of the present study}} seemed to indicate that cryptosporidiosis might be spreading to other species of birds and to other locations in the zoo, which was not previously documented. This study also suggested the probable association of cryptosporidiosis among birds and their bird handlers.

40|$|AbstractMalaysia and Thailand share {{a common}} border {{stretching}} from Perlis, Kedah, Perak and Kelantan in Malaysia; and Satun, Songkhla, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand. Malaysia's Belum-Temengor Forest Complex (BTFC) and Ulu Muda Forest Reserve are well within Thailand's Sungalakiri NP (National Park), Nam Tok Than To FP (Forest Park), Banglang NP, Bang Lang Reservoir, Si-Po Waterfall NP and Khao Luang NP (THAI-NPs). This paper intends to study the tourism potential of hornbill migration between BTFC in Northern Perak, Peninsular Malaysia and the enclave of THAI-NPs. BTFC is the only forest complex in Malaysia with 10 species of hornbill in the world. Plain-pouched <b>Hornbill</b> (<b>Aceros</b> subruficollis) is the fascinating species of hornbill that seasonally migrate daily in large numbers. An ongoing study by Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) on the migrating, roosting and feeding sites of the Plain-pouched Hornbill (PPHB) is in progress. There is no record of large daily migrating PPHB anywhere else known in the world. Preliminary observations indicate {{there is a possibility}} for PPHB crossing into Thailand from BTFC. This made it an important tourist attraction and a natural phenomenon worth conserving and perhaps promoting as wildlife cross border migration tourism. The methods include researching data from various sources and interviews. Results showed that the sheer large numbers of PPHB {{has been one of the}} attractions for bird watching and tourists visiting BTFC. Promoting this phenomenon will helps prevent the lost of the natural habitats sharing the same common border that support this PPHB.

40|$|The loss of {{tropical}} forests and associated biodiversity {{is a global}} concern. Conservation efforts in tropical countries such as India have mostly focused on state-administered protected areas despite the existence of vast tracts of forest outside these areas. We studied hornbills (Bucerotidae), an ecologically important vertebrate group and a flagship for tropical forest conservation, to assess the importance of forests outside protected areas in Arunachal Pradesh, north-east India. We conducted a state-wide survey to record encounters with hornbills in seven protected areas, six state-managed reserved forests and six community-managed unclassed forests. We estimated the density of hornbills in one protected area, four reserved forests and two unclassed forests in eastern Arunachal Pradesh. The state-wide survey showed that the mean rate of encounter of rufous-necked <b>hornbills</b> <b>Aceros</b> nipalensis was four times higher in protected areas than in reserved forests and 22 times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The mean rate of encounter of wreathed hornbills Rhyticeros undulatus was twice as high in protected areas as in reserved forests and eight times higher in protected areas than in unclassed forests. The densities of rufous-necked hornbill were higher inside protected areas, whereas the densities of great hornbill Buceros bicornis and wreathed hornbill were similar inside and outside protected areas. Key informant surveys revealed possible extirpation of some hornbill species at sites in two protected areas and three unclassed forests. These results highlight a paradoxical situation where individual populations of hornbills are being lost even in some legally protected habitat, whereas they continue to persist {{over most of the}} landscape. Better protection within protected areas and creative community-based conservation efforts elsewhere are necessary to maintain hornbill populations in this biodiversity-rich region...|$|R
40|$|Background: The Visayan Tarictic Hornbill (Penelopides panini) and the Walden's <b>Hornbill</b> (<b>Aceros</b> waldeni) are two {{threatened}} hornbill species {{endemic to}} the western islands of the Visayas that constitute - between Luzon and Mindanao - the central island group of the Philippine archipelago. In order to evaluate their genetic diversity and to support efforts towards their conservation, we analyzed genetic variation in similar to 600 base pairs (bp) of the mitochondrial control region I and at 12 - 19 nuclear microsatellite loci. The sampling covered extant populations, still occurring only on two islands (P. panini: Panay and Negros, A. waldeni: only Panay), and it was augmented with museum specimens of extinct populations from neighboring islands. For comparison, their less endangered (= more abundant) sister taxa, the Luzon Tarictic Hornbill (P. manillae) from the Luzon and Polillo Islands and the Writhed Hornbill (A. leucocephalus) from Mindanao Island, were {{also included in the}} study. We reconstructed the population history of the two Penelopides species and assessed the genetic population structure of the remaining wild populations in all four species. Results: Mitochondrial and nuclear data concordantly show a clear genetic separation according to the island of origin in both Penelopides species, but also unravel sporadic over-water movements between islands. We found evidence that deforestation in the last century influenced these migratory events. Both classes of markers and the comparison to museum specimens reveal a genetic diversity loss in both Visayan hornbill species, P. panini and A. waldeni, as compared to their more abundant relatives. This might have been caused by local extinction of genetically differentiated populations together with the dramatic decline in the abundance of the extant populations. Conclusions: We demonstrated a loss in genetic diversity of P. panini and A. waldeni as compared to their sister taxa P. manillae and A. leucocephalus. Because of the low potential for gene flow and population exchange across islands, saving of the remaining birds of almost extinct local populations - be it in the wild or in captivity - is particularly important to preserve the species' genetic potential...|$|R

Results Here we present the first complete mt genome of the avian family Bucerotidae, i. e., that of two Philippine <b>hornbills,</b> <b>Aceros</b> waldeni and Penelopides panini. The mt genomes are characterized by a tandemly duplicated region encompassing part of cytochrome b, 3 tRNAs, NADH 6, and the control region. The duplicated fragments are identical to each other except for a short section in domain I and for the length of repeat motifs in domain III of the control region. Due to the heteroplasmy with regard to the number of these repeat motifs, there is some size variation in both genomes; with around 21, 657 bp (A. waldeni) and 22, 737 bp (P. panini), they significantly exceed the hitherto longest known avian mt genomes, that of the albatrosses. We discovered concerted evolution between the duplicated fragments within individuals. The existence of differences between individuals in coding genes {{as well as in the}} control region, which are maintained between duplicates, indicates that recombination apparently occurs frequently, i. e., in every generation. Conclusions The homogenised duplicates are interspersed by a short fragment which shows no sign of recombination. We hypothesize that this region corresponds to the so-called Replication Fork Barrier (RFB), which has been described from the chicken mitochondrial genome. As this RFB is supposed to halt replication, it offers a potential mechanistic explanation for frequent recombination in mitochondrial genomes. </p...|$|R
