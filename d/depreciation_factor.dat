For a home acquisition an individual household uses own equity provided by the buyer and outside equity provided by banks. Such outside equity can help to increase the volume of new housing starts, {{but it can also}} drive up the prices of all homes. The crisis of home asset prices started already in 1997 in the U. S., but accelerated in 2002 and reached its breaking points in 2005 - 2006 when 65 % of the new outside equity was used to increase house prices rather than the volume of housing starts. From 1997 house prices were rising faster than the CPI index, while over the period 2000 - 2006 incomes just kept up with the CPI index. The value of savings out of the increased income levels were worth less and less in purchasing power as compared to the asset price movements. The savings <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor</b> was 34 % over the latter period. Both the Houses of Congress and the Fed had a policy of benign neglect of the growing gap between asset values and incomes and savings developments. Banks did not take the savings <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor</b> into account and undervalued their real risks to their portfolios and substantially overvalued their profits for 2005 and 2006. The mortgage securitisation process transferred the risks in a substantial manner to European savers, which did not diminish the risks of the savings <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor,</b> but only changed the providers of the savings.

The research will Identify possible losses from liquidation of current and prospective operational clients and propose suitable valuation procedure for equipment to be secured. The researcher conducted a case study survey from the IDC’s operational strategic business units (SBUs) employees. The data for the {{research was}} collected using a questionnaire in a structured survey format and examining current records on trends with regards to the propositions. For each of the SBUs, copies of well-structured questionnaires were given to an account manager. The study also sampled valuation reports prepared by valuers at IDC. The contents of valuation reports were examined and compared with data recovered by IDC after a client default. The researcher noted that recoveries from physical collateral generally lagged behind expected recoveries as reported in valuation reports. There were, however, mixed responses on the certainty and uncertainty of valuation figures reported. The key findings were that there was a need to re-look at the factors considered in the valuation practice. The recognition of appraisal depreciation considers the progressive decline in value as operational use and changes to the technical and economic environment diminish the worth of an asset. The expected asset retirement profile with its influence on life characteristics, in addition to the applied operation and maintenance policies, influences the rate of asset <b>depreciation.</b> These <b>factors</b> {{play a critical role in}} making sound estimates as far as valuation is concerned...|$|R

40|$|One of {{the crucial}} factors to be {{considered}} {{during the process of}} valuation of plant, machinery and equipment (PME) is the <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor.</b> This {{is due to the fact}} that most PME have pre-determined economic life and majority of them are already in use. Most PME are subjected to at least three different types of depreciation which will affect the value of each PME. Hence, there is a dire need for the Valuer to be able to identify and quantify depreciation factors which should be done during the inspection of PME. Depreciation of PME could be in the form of physical obsolescence, economic obsolescence or functional (technological) obsolescence. Physical obsolescence (PO) is one of the categories of depreciation that affect PME most, due to wear and tear and exposure to the elements and specifically with regard to the climate of a particular country where PME is located. At present, it seems there is no standard procedure or a methodological approach to identify and quantify PO during the inspection. This paper concerns the identification and quantification of the PO. The preliminary study done among a group of valuers with different background found that, much guess work take place during the inspection itself. Further study needs to be done to eliminate this problem and perhaps to come up with a methodological approach to enable valuers to identify and quantify PO while carrying out the inspection of PME. The methodological approach will not only strengthen the basis on the depreciation given on PME but also a standardized format that can be used as part of the valuation process of PME where PO is part of the depreciation that needs to be considered. The approach once developed, will remove the guess work of identifying and quantifying of PO and hence giving the valuation reports added credibility...|$|E

In this case, the assessment {{of the value of the}} industrial machinery that can be reused is a problem that often arises. In the literature different approaches to estimate plant and industrial machinery are illustrated. Each method includes several specification and, in practice, only in exceptional cases, there are consistent data for comparison. The major problem consists in the identification and the valuation of the level of depreciation which intervenes in the definition of the value of used industrial machinery. In the present work an algorithm to determine in a rational manner the depreciation of used industrial machinery has developed. The procedure has its theoretical basis in the analysis of formal deductions of the value of new machinery. The model defined in this research considers the factors that contribute to decrease the original value of the machinery. Empirical formulas have been developed to estimate the market value of used industrial machinery on the basis of quantitative and qualitative analysis of depreciation functions. The interpretation and schematization of the results have led to the definition of value-time curves for the three main <b>depreciation</b> <b>factors</b> (age, income decay, obsolescence).

40|$|Cars {{and also}} {{equipment}} used in production processes depreciate in value through their use. Other assets like homes, share and bonds do not depreciate {{in the same}} manner. The latter asset values {{go up and down}} not {{as a consequence of the}} remaining life period, but because of their links with income, savings and interest rate developments in a country. It is a well accepted fact that when average incomes grow slower than the CPI index, individual households cannot continue to buy the same package of goods and services as in previous years. The purchasing power of the income level is reduced. This can be called the “income depreciation” factor. The depreciation does not take place on the goods side, but on the money side. Savings –the act of postponing consumption to a future date- can show the same type of “depreciation”. Savings are used to buy assets like homes, shares and bonds. Most individual households who want to buy a home need a mortgage to get onto the property ladder. They need outside equity –other people’s savings. Outside equity is usually provided by the banking sector. Mortgage lending by the banks can help to build more homes – the economic use of funds - but it can simultaneously cause a rise in house prices above the CPI index, provided that incomes keep pace with the latter – the financial or non-economic use of funds. These are non-economic because such price changes neither create output nor employment. Existing homeowners become richer on paper as their own equity in their home increases. However prospective homeowners see the value of their savings reduced. This phenomenon can be called “savings depreciation” and can be measured by the “savings depreciation factor”. In this paper the U. S. was chosen to demonstrate the impact of the savings <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor</b> and its relationship to economic growth levels. ...|$|E

The aim {{of this article is to}} analyze the expenses of the project “Development strategy of the Russian healthcare system for the long-term period 2015 – 2030 ”. The main objectives of this article are the definition of the technical condition of the buildings and improvement of health facilities, evaluation of the value of fixed assets in the healthcare and medical equipment depreciation, evaluation of tariff s in the compulsory health insurance system. Methodology. the method of comparative analysis of 10 past years indicators is used in this article Results. From 2005 to 2014 healthcare expenditures have increased 3 times, which is comparable to GDP growth. In the same period, investments in health have increased by 2 times. The main increase in expenditures occurred in the wages. These trends may indicate a lack of attention in relation to fixed assets. In relation to the renovation and the <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor,</b> rate of growth and the level of investment cast doubt on the adequacy and sustainability of the healthcare’s material basis for the provision of necessary medical assistance. It is required to calculate the standard, which includes continuous updating of fixed assets based on the each region of RF, depending on the regional characteristics and the structure of fixed assets. Conclusions / Significance. The study concluded that at the moment the size of the annual investment in health by the federal and regional budgets do not meet the needs of even simple reproduction, not to mention the modernization and development. Planning budget investment requirements can be carried out based on a special standard ratio, which takes into account the volume, composition and structure of fixed assets. Financial stability of the Russian healthcare depends not only on compulsory health insurance system, as a source of operating costs, but also on the cost of investments, providing capital expenditures. </p...|$|E
40|$|In an {{influential}} paper from 1995, "International R&D spillovers", David Coe and Elhanan Helpman use data {{on trade and}} R&D expenditures for 22 countries to estimate {{the effects of a}} country's own R&D effort and the R&D effort of its trade partners on the country's TFP. They use a model of endogenous, innovation-driven growth as basis for the empirical equations. The main idea is that a country benefits from the cumulative R&D stock of its trade partners as well as its own R&D stock, through spillover effects from trade in intermediate inputs. The intermediate inputs can be horizontally differentiated, which means that a new input is equally good as an old, and investment in R&D increases the number of available varieties. The inputs can also be vertically differentiated, so that {{the development of a new}} input will replace an old one because of its increased quality. In the endogenous growth framework, R&D investments are made by firms seeking monopoly profits in imperfectly competetive markets. This R&D effort generates a product or process than can be patented and give rise to a profit for the firm, as well as a non-appropriable product that will increase the country's stock of knowledge. This non-appropriable part is what generates the spillover effect. In the case of horizontally differentiated inputs, the investments in R&D increase the stock of knowledge through an increase in the number of available inputs, which in turn decreases future R&D costs. With vertically differentiated inputs, the development of a higher quality input will enable future entrepreneurs to build on a higher quality foundation. In both cases, the stock of knowledge increases and there are spillovers from current to future R&D activities. Coe and Helpman (1995) argue that since intermediate inputs are traded internationally, a country's productivity depends on its own R&D stock as well as the R&D stock of its trade partners. The domestic R&D stock is constructed as the sum of the country's cumulative R&D expenditures, multiplied by a constant <b>depreciation</b> <b>factor.</b> In the basic specification used in Coe and Helpman (1995), the foreign R&D stock variable is constructed as a weighted sum of the R&D stocks of the country's trade partners, where the weight is the imports from one country as share of the total imports. They find a positive and significant effect of both R&D stocks on the country's TFP, and interpret this as evidence that there are significant international R&D spillovers from trade. Norway is one of the countries used in the paper. I use panel data on Norwegian firms to see whether this effect of imported R&D spillovers can be found on the firm level in Norway. The data set consists of data from the accounting and manufacturing statistics, as well as data on trade and R&D expenditures for Norwegian firms. This is combined with data on R&D expenditures on the sector level for 22 member countries of the OECD. The variables are constructed on the basis of the variables used in Coe and Helpman (1995) with some adjustments to fit the data set at hand. I estimate the basic specification from Coe and Helpman (1995) using the fixed effects estimator. The software used for the estimations is Stata 11. I find a positive and significant effect of the firm's own R&D stock. However, the foreign R&D stock appears to have no significant impact on the productivity of the firms. This indicates that any spillover effects that Norway might get from foreign R&D, are not transmitted through each firm's imported intermediate inputs. I also estimate several extensions of the original specification. In the first extension, I substitute the firm's own R&D stock with the lagged R&D expenditure, because of the nonstationarity of the R&D stock variable. In the second, the weights are changed to reflect the fact that a firm can purchase intermediate inputs domestically as well as internationally. The foreign R&D stock variable is then constructed using the imports from one country as share of total purchase of intermediate inputs as weights. The third extension is aggregating the foreign R&D stock variable to the sector level, to see if I can detect any intra-industry spillovers that are transmitted through trade in intermediate inputs. The positive and significant effect of the firm's own R&D stock is stable in the various specifications. The foreign R&D stock variable is however not statistically significant at any of the conventional levels. This confirms the indication that any spillover effects do not emanate from each firm's imports of intermediate inputs, and it also indicates that any spillover effects have to appear at a more aggregated level...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{is focused on}} the question of proportional development in economic growth modeling. A multilevel dynamic optimization model is developed for the construction of balanced proportions for production factors and investments in a situation of changing prices. At the first level, models with production functions of different types are examined within the classical static optimization approach. It is shown that all these models possess the property of proportionality: in the solution of product maximization and cost minimization problems, production factor levels are directly proportional to each other with coefficients of proportionality depending on prices and elasticities of production functions. At the second level, proportional solutions of the first level are transferred to an economic growth model {{to solve the problem of}} dynamic optimization for the investments in production factors. Due to proportionality conditions and the homogeneity condition of degree 1 for the macroeconomic production functions, the original nonlinear dynamics is converted to a linear system of differential equations that describe the dynamics of production factors. In the conversion, all peculiarities of the nonlinear model are hidden in a time-dependent scale factor (total factor productivity) of the linear model, which is determined by proportions between prices and elasticities of the production functions. For a control problem with linear dynamics, analytic formulas are obtained for optimal development trajectories within the Pontryagin maximum principle for statements with finite and infinite horizons. It is shown that solutions of these two problems differ crucially from each other: in finite horizon problems the optimal investment strategy inevitably has the zero regime at the final stage, whereas the infinite horizon problem always has a strictly positive solution. A remarkable result of the proposed model consists in constructive analytical solutions for optimal investments in production factors, which depend on the price dynamics and other economic parameters such as elasticities of production functions, total <b>factor</b> productivity, and <b>depreciation</b> <b>factors.</b> This feature serves as a background for the productive fusion of optimization models for investments in production factors in the framework of a multilevel structure and provides a solid basis for constructing optimal trajectories of economic development...|$|R

As the light sources currently being specified continue to evolve, it is necessary to reevaluate the methods used in calculating light loss factors, as well as carefully consider the consequences of different product performance attributes.

Despite its proven importance, it is common to see a construction project failing to achieve its objectives within the specific cost. Cost variation is a very frequent phenomenon and is almost associated with nearly constructing all wastewater projects. Maintaining steady cost projection on wastewater projects had been recently an issue of serious concern, both to the client and project contractors. Cost deviation from initial cost plan had been prevalent on construction sites. However, little or no effort has been made to curtail the phenomenon, this research work attempts to identify, investigate and rank factors perceived to affect cost variation in the Egyptian wastewater projects with respect to their relative importance so as to proffer possible ways of coping with this phenomenon. To achieve this objective, author invited practitioners and experts, comprising a statistically representative sample, to participate in a structured questionnaire survey. Brain storming was taken into consideration, through which a number of cost variation factors were identified for constructing wastewater projects. Totally 52 factors were short-listed to be made part of the questionnaire survey and the survey was conducted with experts and representatives from private, public and local general construction firms. The data were analyzed using Relative Importance Index, ranking and simple percentages. It was analytically discovered that factors such as: (1) Lowest bidding procurement method; (2) Additional work; (3) Bureaucracy in bidding/tendering method; (4) Wrong method of cost estimation; and (5) Funding problems were critical for causing cost variation, while (1) Inaccurate cost estimation; (2) Mode of financing and payment for completed work; (3) Unexpected ground conditions; (4) Inflation; and (5) Fluctuation in prices of raw materials are also responsible. The study concluded with recommending, ensuring adequate and available source of finance, allocating sufficient time and funding the design phase while cost estimators should be aware of the problems, but must not allow to deflect them from their primary tasks, which must always use all data and time available to produce the best possible estimate, improve owner’s project management procedures, material bulk purchase, establishing fraudulent system of individual accountability to discourage stealing and other related vices, adequate planning by breaking project planning into short term achievable goals, medium term planning and long term planning, and through estimation process for projects cost calculations, with vigilant planning, keeping in view trends of inflation and <b>depreciation</b> <b>factors,</b> construction cost variation trends in wastewater projects with lead to smoother implementation and achievement of desired cost control. Also, this paper serves as a guide and reference for contractors and construction managers for more effective management in constructing wastewater projects to achieve a competitive level of quality and a cost effective project...|$|R
30|$|These {{changes in}} CAR in {{relation}} to psychological stress raises the possibility of CAR also being an appropriate measure to monitor responses to physiological stressors (i.e., exercise). The benefits of a biomarker such as CAR are severalfold. Firstly, measures can be obtained via saliva which is less invasive to obtain as compared to biomarkers obtained from plasma or serum. Secondly, and in contrast to other assessments of overstrain which require an athlete to complete multiple exercise sessions [38], the measures can be obtained at rest, greatly reducing subject burden. Lastly, the multitude of factors that are thought to affect CAR could confer a potential marker of global stress (e.g., allostatic load), which {{may be more important}} for monitoring health or potential of burnout or overtraining in athletes. Since the symptomology of the overtraining syndrome includes psychosocial disturbances which accompany the <b>depreciation</b> of physiological <b>factors,</b> CAR may be useful in monitoring both components simultaneously.|$|R
40|$|The basic neoclassical growth model {{accounts}} {{well for}} the postwar cyclical behavior of the U. S. economy prior to the 1990 s, provided that variations in population growth, <b>depreciation</b> rates, total <b>factor</b> productivity, and taxes are incorporated. For the 1990 s, the model predicts a depressed economy, when in fact the U. S. economy boomed. We extend the base model by introducing intangible investment and non-neutral technology change with respect to producing intangible investment goods and find that the 1990 s are not puzzling {{in light of this}} new theory. There is compelling micro and macro evidence for our extension, and the predictions of the theory are in conformity with U. S. national products, incomes, and capital gains. We use the theory to compare current accounting measures for labor productivity and investment with the corresponding measures for the model economy with intangible investment. Our findings show that standard accounting measures greatly understate the boom in productivity and investment. ...|$|R
40|$|The global {{economic}} recovery which {{had begun in}} mid 2009 has continued, though its strength has varied from one region to another. The emerging economies have been the driving force, propelling the revival of international trade, while the upturn {{is likely to be}} more gradual in the advanced economies, as is generally the case after economic recessions accompanied by a financial crisis. The euro area has also returned to positive growth since mid 2009, but this growth has been far less dynamic than {{in the rest of the}} world. Moreover, the increase in budget deficits and public debt has given rise to fears over the sustainability of public finances in some countries, causing renewed tensions on the financial markets. In Belgium, activity also started to pick up from the third quarter of 2009, although the pace remained moderate. Altogether, however, the decline in GDP of 3 p. c. in 2009 was slightly smaller than in the euro area as a whole, and growth is estimated to be a little more sustained this year and next. According to the projections, it will reach 1. 3 p. c. in 2010 and 1. 7 p. c. in 2011. At first, it is likely to be underpinned by foreign demand, while consumption and, later, investment should gradually gather momentum. The labour market has displayed some resilience, considering the seriousness of the economic recession. Job losses and the rise in unemployment were limited by large-scale use of temporary layoffs and by a sharp fall in corporate productivity. However, since these factors are likely to return to normal, the reduction in employment is projected to continue in 2010. Net job losses are estimated at 12, 900 persons in the course of the year, following a decline of 38, 500 units during 2009. Employment should resume growth during 2011. The unemployment rate increased from 7 p. c. in 2008 to 8 p. c. in 2009; it is forecast at 8. 8 p. c. in 2011. Following a brief period of disinflation during 2009, resulting from negative base effects influencing the movement in energy prices, inflation began rising again at the end of last year and during the initial months of 2010, owing to the recent rise in international oil prices and the euro’s <b>depreciation.</b> While this <b>factor</b> will continue to play during the coming months, the pressures exerted by wages are expected to be contained at first, before gathering strength at the end of the forecasting period as economic activity picks up. In all, as an annual average, inflation – which had been zero in 2009 – is forecast at 2 p. c. in 2010 and 1. 9 p. c. in 2011. According to the NAI data, Belgium’s public finances recorded a deficit of 6 p. c. of GDP in 2009. In the macroeconomic context described above, and taking account of the measures adopted by the federal and regional governments, if the policy remains unchanged that deficit should come to 5 p. c. of GDP in 2010 and 5. 3 p. c. in 2011. After having declined continuously since 1993, to reach 84. 2 p. c. in 2007, the ratio of public debt to GDP has been rising again in 2008, mainly as a result of the capital injections and loans granted to financial institutions, and in 2009, due to the economic recession. The debt ratio is projected to rise further, although at a slower pace, over the projection horizon, from 96. 8 p. c. of GDP in 2009 to 100. 2 p. c. in 2010 and 103. 1 p. c. in 2011.
