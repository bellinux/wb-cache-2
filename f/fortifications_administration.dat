50|$|The Royal Swedish Air Force Materiel Administration was {{established}} on 1 July 1936 {{with the task}} in technical and economic terms to exercise top management and oversight of the Swedish Air Force. The agency was first organized in the Materiel Department (1936-1954), Commissariat Department (1936-1954), Building Department (1936-1948, was merged {{with the exception of}} the Airfield Department (Flygfältsbyrån) into the <b>Fortifications</b> <b>Administration)</b> and the Civil Office (1936-1954). In 1948 the Airfield Department (1948-1963) became an own unit, and in 1952/1953 so did the Central Planning (to 1963) and the Personnel Office (until 1954).|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1940s the decades ago planned {{relocation}} of the regiment to Järvafältet became reality. On 5 October 1946 the Svea Life Guards officially left its barracks at Linnégatan in Östermalm, Stockholm and {{this took place}} at a ceremony in the park at the memorial stone. The then executive officer, colonel Gösta von Stedingk handed the memorial stone over to the City of Stockholm, represented by the municipal commissioner of the Stockholm Central Board of Administration (Stadskollegium), Yngve Larsson. It then left Stockholm which had been its location for more than 400 years. The regiment moved in 1947 to Sörentorp in Solna. The design of the area {{was carried out by}} the Royal <b>Fortifications</b> <b>Administration.</b> The area was given a relatively free pooled plan, and Bertil Karlén was the architect of the buildings. In 1970 Svea Life Guards moved again, this time to an area at Granhammar Castle in Kungsängen.|$|E
5000|$|Triewald {{was given}} the title {{director}} mechanicus, and in 1735 was appointed kapten-mekanikus (Captain of Mechanics) at the <b>Fortification</b> <b>Administration,</b> deemed to be [...] "the {{only one in the}} country suitable for this post", and given an annual pension by the Parliament.|$|R
50|$|As {{early as}} 1 January 1944, {{the next major}} change {{occurred}} in the Army Materiel <b>Administration,</b> when the <b>fortification</b> board and the medical board became independent government agencies (as <b>Fortification</b> <b>Administration</b> (Arméns fortifikationsförvaltning) and Defense Medical Administration (Försvarets sjukvårdsförvaltning)). After this the Army Materiel Administration consisted of an ordnance department, a civilian bureau and supply department; the latter consisting of central, industrial (suspended in 1945), maintenance, motor fuel, barracks investigation (suspended in 1952) and the equine and veterinary stock bureaus-- {{as well as the}} inventory control office.|$|R
40|$|The {{land around}} Herrevad Abbey {{consists}} mostly of pastures {{with a lot}} of old coarse oaks, a touch of broad-leaved decidous forest andmixed deciduous and coniferous forest. In the year 2010 the Swedish Environmental Protection Agency became owner of the area around Herrevad Abbey, previously owned by the Swedish National <b>Fortification</b> <b>Administration.</b> A high pressure from hunting occurred during the Swedish National <b>Fortification</b> <b>Administration</b> ownership. This resulted in a decrease of the roe deer (Capreolus capreolus L.) population. A pellet-group count is a reliable, indirect inventory method that is used with high frequence within wildlife management since the 1930 s. Pellet-group count is used in Swedish Wildlife research since the 1977 at Grimsö Research Station and today an increasing interest for this method is seen both in nature management, among hunters and  in the Swedish Association for Hunters. Through a pellet-group count of a roe deer population, an underestimated index of the total density is shown, which means that the investigated population can be larger than the survey shows. The pellet-group count in this study covered 3, 20 km- 2 with a total of 315 plots. The plot had a circular shape and covered 10 m 2, which is recommended for roe deer surveys. Each plot was investigated twice, one round clockwise and one round counter clock-wise to increase the precision of the survey. The calculation showed 10, 76 roe deer per 1, 00 km- 2 in winter population during 2010; with a 10 % set-off for winter mortality and 8, 22 roe deer per 1, 00 km- 2 in winter population with a 30 % set-off. The density with 10, 76 roe deer /km- 2 is low compared to experimental plots at Bogesund, Ekenäs, where the population is estimated to around 17 - 23 roe deer/ 1, 00 km- 2. A calculation for carrying capacity shows that the population will reach the density limit within four years at Herrevad Abbey...|$|R
50|$|On {{either side}} of the river, on the left bank of the river in between the waterfalls and the weir, there is a temple {{dedicated}} to Shiva enclosed by strong <b>fortification.</b> The District <b>Administration</b> has recently constructed a swimming pool which is very popular among the children.|$|R
50|$|After {{the conquest}} of Babylon by the Persian Empire, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews {{to return to their}} native land and rebuild Jerusalem, sacked by Nebuchadnezzar II in 586 BC. While {{rebuilding}} the city's <b>fortifications,</b> the Persian <b>administration</b> also constructed a new citadel north of the Temple Mount enclosure, as part of a general Persian effort to bolster the empire's defences. This citadel is the Biryah (Hebrew: בירה) referred to in Nehemiah 2:8 and 7:2, appearing as the Baris in Greek translations of the Septuagint. The origin of the word is not entirely clear, but may have been borrowed into Hebrew from Assyrian birtu or bistu meaning a citadel or castle within a city, or a fort located at a strategic position outside a city. It may also derive from the Old Persian baru, meaning 'fort'.|$|R
