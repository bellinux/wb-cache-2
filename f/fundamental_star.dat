Tycho preferred observing the angular distance between the sun and Venus when the latter was visible in the daytime.|$|E

STAR is a biological solid waste treatment system that reduces solid waste, neutralizes pathogens, and produces a stabilized product amenable to nutrient reuse and water recovery in a closed life support system. The STAR system is designed for long-duration space missions or long-term remote planetary operations. A system-level design analysis for sizing a STAR process and the subsequent ESM-based sensitivity analysis based on a 600 -day Mars surface mission with a 6 -person crew will be presented.

The problems found in the FK 3 /FK 4 /FK 5 sequence are not present in either the GC or the N 30. This lends support to the hypothesis advanced in our previous paper that the FK 3, {{and to a lesser}} extent the FK 4 declination system, are distorted by high angular frequency systematics. On the other hand, both the GC and N 30 equatorial coordinate and proper motion distributions nicely follow the predictions of mathematical statistics.

40|$|We {{present a}} set of hydro-dynamical {{numerical}} simulations of the Antennae galaxies {{in order to understand}} the origin of the central overlap starburst. Our dynamical model provides a good match to the observed nuclear and overlap star formation, especially when using a range of rather inefficient stellar feedback efficiencies (0. 01 50 % (> 35 %) of the emission in each band is concentrated in the overlap region while only < 30 % (< 15 %) is distributed to the combined emission from the two galactic nuclei in the simulations (observations). As a proof of principle we show that parameter variations in the feedback model result in unambiguous changes both in the global and in the spatially resolved observable far-infrared properties of Antennae galaxy models. Our results strengthen the importance of direct, spatially resolved comparative studies of matched galaxy merger simulations as a valuable tool to constrain the <b>fundamental</b> <b>star</b> formation and feedback physics.

40|$|We review recent {{advances}} in the analytical and numerical modeling of the star formation rate in molecular clouds and discuss the available observational constraints. We focus on molecular clouds as the <b>fundamental</b> <b>star</b> formation sites, {{rather than on the}} larger-scale processes that form the clouds and set their properties. Molecular clouds are shaped into a complex filamentary structure by supersonic turbulence, with {{only a small fraction of}} the cloud mass channeled into collapsing protostars over a free-fall time of the system. In recent years, the physics of supersonic turbulence has been widely explored with computer simulations, leading to statistical models of this fragmentation process, and to the prediction of the star formation rate as a function of fundamental physical parameters of molecular clouds, such as the virial parameter, the rms Mach number, the compressive fraction of the turbulence driver, and the ratio of gas to magnetic pressure. Infrared space telescopes, as well as ground-based observatories have provided unprecedented probes of the filamentary structure of molecular clouds and the location of forming stars within them. 1...|$|E

40|$|Star forming dwarf galaxies (SFDGs) {{have a high}} {{gas content}} and low metallicities, {{reminiscent}} of the basic entities in hierarchical galaxy formation scenarios. In the young universe they probably also {{played a major role}} in the cosmic reionization. Their abundant presence in the local volume and their youthful character make them ideal objects for detailed studies of the initial stellar mass function (IMF), <b>fundamental</b> <b>star</b> formation processes and its feedback to the interstellar medium. Occasionally we witness SFDGs involved in extreme starbursts, giving rise to strongly elevated production of super star clusters and global superwinds, mechanisms yet to be explored in more detail. SFDGs is the initial state of all dwarf galaxies and the relation to the environment provides us with a key to how different types of dwarf galaxies are emerging. In this review we will put the emphasis on the exotic starburst phase, as it seems less important for present day galaxy evolution but perhaps fundamental in the initial phase of galaxy formation.

40|$|Optical {{networking}} is {{a promising}} solution {{to support the}} ever-increasing Internet traffic. This thesis aims to investigate the important issues of topology design, resource sharing, differentiated service provision, flow control {{as well as the}} methodology for performance evaluation of optical networks. We first build two analytical models in order to approximate the loss rate of an Optical Burst Switching (OBS) node more accurately than the traditional burst-based methods. Through the analysis of interacting bursts at the core nodes, we compare the loss ratio of different flows under various assembly parameters. We then propose a DiffSery scheme by adjusting the assembly parameters for different optical bursts. This scheme is suitable for a distributed OBS network without any requirement on centralized information or operation. Next, we design a feedback-based OBS controller by assigning an exponential distribution to the burst assembly intervals. The loss rate of a flow can be controlled by adjusting the assembly timer. Based on this, we design and study a generic OBS controller for different assembly algorithms and signaling protocols that do not need global network information nor affect the network throughput. Some efficient predictor and adjuster models are proposed to implement the control process. Performance evaluation shows that this method is superior to other ordinary schemes based on the rate-adjustment method. Some critical issues on the system design and parameter settings are also investigated and discussed. Finally, we revisit the <b>fundamental</b> <b>star</b> topology to develop an overlaid-star topological variation and address various implementation issues in such architecture. We model the node connections as an asymmetrical multiconnection three-stage Clos network, and propose a network flow model to solve the routing, wavelength assignment and time slot assignment problems under the time-division-multiplexing operation. We demonstrate via simulations that this overlaid-star topology can support flexible QoS provisioning that we are currently studying. In summary, our work provides a technologically feasible solution to provide required QoS for future high-speed networks using available optical technologies...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Balmer {{lines are}} an {{important}} diagnostic of stellar atmospheric structure, since they are formed at {{a wide range of}} depths within the atmosphere. The different Balmer lines are formed at slightly different depths making them useful atmospheric diagnostics. The low sensitivity to surface gravity for stars cooler than ∼ 8000 K makes them excellent diagnostics in the treatment of atmospheric convection. For hotter stars Balmer profiles are sensitive to both effective temperature and surface gravity. Provided we know the surface gravity of these stars from some other method (e. g. from eclipsing binary systems), we can use them to determine effective temperature. In previous work, we have found no significant systematic problems with using uvby photometry to determine atmospheric parameters of <b>fundamental</b> (and standard) <b>stars.</b> In fact, uvby was found to be very good for obtaining both Teff and log g. Using Hα and Hβ profiles, we have found that both the Canuto & Mazzitteli and standard Kurucz mixinglength theory without approximate overshooting are both in agreement to within the uncertainties of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>stars.</b> Overshooting models were always clearly discrepant.

40|$|Abstract. The {{combination}} of HIPPARCOS measurements with suitable ground-based astrometric data improves significantly {{the accuracy of}} the proper motions of bright stars. The comparison of both types of data allows us also to identify and to eliminate, at least partially, cosmic errors in the quasi-instantaneously measured HIPPARCOS data which are caused by undetected astrometric binaries. We describe a simple averaging method for the {{combination of}} two independent compilation catalogues. The combination of the basic FK 5 with HIPPARCOS leads to the Sixth Catalogue of <b>Fundamental</b> <b>Stars</b> (FK 6). The accuracy of the FK 6 proper motions is higher than that of HIPPARCOS by a factor of about 2 in the single-star mode, and by a factor of more than 4 in the long-term prediction mode which takes cosmic errors into account. We present also the error budget for a combination of the Boss General Catalogue (GC) with HIPPARCOS data.
