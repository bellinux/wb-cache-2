5|$|Families {{living in}} the area harvest the grapes {{in the spring and}} summer to produce a variety of {{products}} ranging from raisins, <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> a molasses known as dibs. The Bethlehem area, Beit Jala in particular, and the village of Jifna are known regionally for their apricots and apricot jam as is the Tulkarm area for its olives and olive oil.|$|E
5|$|Granulated sugars {{are used}} at the table, to {{sprinkle}} on foods and to sweeten hot drinks (coffee and tea), and in home baking to add sweetness and texture to baked products (cookies and cakes) and desserts (pudding and ice cream). They are also used as a preservative to prevent micro-organisms from growing and perishable food from spoiling, as in candied fruits, <b>jams,</b> <b>and</b> marmalades.|$|E
5|$|McCudden was {{determined}} his machine {{would remain in}} first-class fighting order. He spent three days working with his fitters and armourers, stripping down the Vickers gun's synchronising gear, firing at the butts and making eight test flights shooting at ground targets. His armourers joked that his guns would never work in the air if he wore {{them out on the}} ground. He continued to experience <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> his unclaimed victim of 14 September 1917—Ernst Wiegand—was able to escape and crash-land wounded in German territory thanks to another stoppage. Since his crash was not witnessed his claim went uncredited.|$|E

40|$|The aim {{of study}} is to make {{preserved}} products using wood apple. Wood apple is the cheaper, highly nutritious and easily perishable and seasonally available fruit and {{it was decided to}} preserve for human consumption throughout the year. This study was planned to utilize the preserved wood apple by preserving them as <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar. Using wood apple preserved products like <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar were developed, stored and quality parameters were assessed for a periods of 90 days. Organoleptic evaluation shows storage stability was good in both <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit Bar with respect to flavour and consistency. Nutritive analysis shows reduction in Vitamin C, Calcium and Phosphorous in both <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar during 90 th day of storage. The acidic content of the preserved products decreased in both Jam (2. 5 %) and fruit bar (1. 66 %). No Significant change observed in TSS, pH, pectin and ash value for both <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar during storage. Total sugar increased up to 0. 68 and 0. 89 % and reducing sugar increased to 2. 59 and 1. 53 % in both <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar, respectively. The microbial load of both <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar was under the limit at the end of 90 days. Hence, the prepared <b>jam</b> <b>and</b> fruit bar was safe and fit for consumption...|$|R
50|$|In February 1986, The Human League {{were flown}} out to Minneapolis {{to work at}} Flyte Time Studios with <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Lewis. After initial enthusiasm on both sides the working {{relationship}} began to break down. <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Lewis had total control over the final album and insisted that their own tracks take precedence over the band's material. <b>Jam</b> <b>and</b> Lewis were also intolerant of the band's laid back working methods and their lack of musical technical ability.|$|R
5|$|The crucial factor which {{frustrated}} firefighting efforts was the narrowness of the streets. Even {{under normal}} circumstances, {{the mix of}} carts, wagons, and pedestrians in the undersized alleys was subject to frequent traffic <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> gridlock. During the fire, the passages were additionally blocked by refugees camping in them amongst their rescued belongings, or escaping outwards, away from the centre of destruction, as demolition teams and fire engine crews struggled in vain to move in towards it.|$|E
5|$|The {{sweetness}} of carrots allows the vegetable {{to be used}} in some fruit-like roles. Grated carrots are used in carrot cakes, as well as carrot puddings, an English dish thought to have originated in the early 19th century. Carrots can also be used alone or blended with fruits in <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> preserves. Carrot juice is also widely marketed, especially as a health drink, either stand-alone or blended with juices extracted from fruits and other vegetables.|$|E
5|$|In August 1979, {{after two}} warm-up shows in Copenhagen, Led Zeppelin headlined two concerts at the Knebworth Music Festival, playing {{to a crowd}} of {{approximately}} 104,000 on the first night. A brief, low-key European tour was undertaken in June and July 1980, featuring a stripped-down set without the usual lengthy <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> solos. On 27 June, at a show in Nuremberg, Germany, the concert {{came to an abrupt}} halt {{in the middle of the}} third song, when Bonham collapsed onstage and was rushed to hospital. Speculation in the press suggested that his collapse had been the result of excessive alcohol and drug use, but the band claimed that he had simply overeaten.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{has long}} been a problem in {{wireless}} communications, but with recent advances in adaptive <b>jamming,</b> adaptive anti-jamming, <b>and</b> other advanced physical layer security techniques, it is hard to understand whether we can keep the jammer at bay. In this work, we consider this problem and introduce a game-theoretic framework which gives us a tool to analyze the complex adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming space. To illustrate the strengths and weaknesses in intelligent <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques, we present a straightforward twoplayer instance and analyze a number of possible <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques.

5|$|The 2-acre (1 ha) walled {{kitchen garden}} {{was built in}} the early 1700s to provide fruit and {{vegetables}} for the estate. The Victorian head gardener's cottage is built into the southern wall. Alongside the west wall is a private path, known as the Colonel's Walk, used by the family to bypass the kitchen garden on their way to church. There are traces of original chimneys built into the wall supporting espaliered fruit trees, located there in order to maintain an optimum temperature for year-round growth. One of these chimneys has been restored. The garden is still in use today and includes traditional and exotic varieties , and fruit bushes, some of which are used to make <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> chutneys for sale in the hall's tearooms.|$|E
5|$|The {{fruit of}} {{blackcurrants}} can be eaten raw, {{but it has}} a strong, tart flavour. It can be made into <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> jellies which set readily because of the fruit's high content of pectin and acid. For culinary use, the fruit is usually cooked with sugar to produce a purée, which can then be passed through muslin to separate the juice. The purée {{can be used to make}} blackcurrant preserves and be included in cheesecakes, yogurt, ice cream, desserts, sorbets and many other sweet dishes. The exceptionally strong flavour can be moderated by combining it with other fruits, such as raspberries and strawberries in summer pudding, or apples in crumbles and pies. The juice can be used in syrups and cordials. Blackcurrants are a common ingredient of Rødgrød, a popular kissel-like dessert in North German and Danish cuisines.|$|E
5|$|Heat {{waves are}} a common feature of summers in the city. These heat waves place extra demand on {{electricity}} usage, leading to shortages. In extreme cases, these power shortages during heat waves can cause traffic <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> protests, such as the December 2013 heat wave (longest heat wave ever recorded in Buenos Aires) where increased energy demand lead to energy shortages and power cuts, protests against the government over the lack of service, and traffic jams {{as a result of}} these protests. However, most heat waves are of short duration (usually less than a week), and are followed by the passage of the cold, dry Pampero wind, which brings violent and intense thunderstorms with strong gusts and hail followed by cooler temperatures and lower humidity. Occasionally, a tornado can form, which can strike the city although most tornadoes are relatively weak and rarely cause deaths. The greatest risk for tornadoes occurs in the summer season due to the favourable conditions. These severe storms can damage cars, houses and disrupt public services such as transportation and collection and disposal of urban solid waste.|$|E

5|$|The {{options for}} the new stadium {{included}} adding a third tier to the existing National Stadium, or moving to a new site. This last option was discounted {{because it would have}} required a vast car parking facility, and that would have put severe short-term pressures on the local transport infrastructure, creating traffic <b>jams</b> <b>and</b> pollution. The committee eventually chose a new stadium on the same site but with considerable increase in its capacity. It would also involve moving the alignment of the stadium from west-east to north-south. This was the option supported by the Millennium Commission. It would become the fourth redevelopment of the Cardiff Arms Park site. It was also decided that the new stadium should have a sliding roof to accommodate a multi-use venue, with a grass pitch for rugby and football. The only other sliding roofs in Europe at the time were at two Dutch stadia – the Amsterdam Arena, completed in 1996 with a capacity of 50,000; and Gelredome in Arnhem, a 30,000-capacity ground built from 1996 to 1998.|$|E
5|$|While moving {{offshore}} Atlantic Canada, {{the former}} hurricane produced gale-force winds, peaking at 52mph (83km/h) in Halifax, Nova Scotia. There, the storm also dropped heavy rainfall reaching 9.84in (250mm) over two days, including 3.6in (90mm) in 24hours. Flooding covered {{streets in the}} province, causing traffic <b>jams,</b> <b>and</b> farmlands. In Annapolis Valley, the rainfall washed out a bridge while the winds damaged {{about one-third of the}} apple crop. The dam at Chocolate Lake overflowed due to the rainfall, and a dam broke in Great Village, destroying a nearby bridge. Many trees fell during the storm, resulting in power outages after some fell onto lines. Outside Nova Scotia, the storm produced winds of 51mph (81km/h) in Shediac, New Brunswick, where high waves left coastal damage. In Newfoundland, the storm washed out three bridges, as well as portions of roads and rails, and flooded one house. Throughout Atlantic Canada, high waves washed ashore, sank, or broke at least ten boats from their moorings, killing nine people including seven from an overturned boat sailing from Boston to Yarmouth. Overall damage in Canada was estimated at around $1million (1933CAD), including $250,000 in lost apple crop.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Jamming {{has long}} been a problem in {{wireless}} communications. Recently, adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming techniques have been proposed which aim to use feedback to better perform their task. For an anti-jamming receiver this means detecting <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> adapting its protocol appropriately. For a jammer this means using feedback from the legitimate system to design a high-impact, low-power, hard-to-detect attack. In this work we introduce a toolbox to allow users to tests the performance of adaptive <b>jamming</b> <b>and</b> anti-jamming on the USRP 2 radio platform. These test provide an important function by letting developers understand how well new protocols work against evolving jamming technologies...|$|R
