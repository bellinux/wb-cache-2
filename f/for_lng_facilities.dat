40|$|ABSTRACT: Two-dimensional {{hydrodynamic}} and advection-dispersion simulations {{were carried}} out to identify the appropriate locations of inlet and outlet for cool seawater discharges from the proposed Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal using MIKE- 21 suites of software. The model simulations were validated by comparing the observed and simulated hydrodynamics in terms of water depths, current speeds and directions. The model is satisfactorily correlated with coefficients 0. 98, 0. 86 and 0. 91 for water depth, current speed and direction, respectively. The validated model was extended to predict the advection-dispersion phenomena for the two scenarios based on positions of inlet and outlet and their discharges. The predicted results of cool water discharges were compared to the existing Environmental Health and Safety, World Bank guidelines <b>for</b> <b>LNG</b> discharge <b>facilities.</b> It was observed that a trade-off is required before taking engineering decisions for selecting an environmentally acceptable and energy efficient option for such cool water discharges from an <b>LNG</b> <b>facility...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{consuming}} east region, {{particularly the}} states in the northern part, heavily rely on stored gas to meet the peak demand during the cold winter months. Due to the prevailing cold winters, large population centers and developed infrastructure, {{it is not surprising that}} this region has the highest level of working gas storage capacity of the other regions and the largest number of storage sites, mainly in depleted reservoirs. In addition to underground storage, LNG is increasingly playing a crucial role in providing supplemental backup and/or peaking supply to LDCs on a short term basis. Although the total capacity <b>for</b> these <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> does not match those of underground storage in scale, the short term high deliverability makes up for that.|$|R
40|$|The {{safety and}} {{security}} of liquefied natural gas (LNG) facilities has prompted the need for continued study of LNG mitigation systems. Water spray systems are widely recognized as an effective measure for dispersing LNG vapor clouds. Currently, there are no engineering guidelines available for water curtain applications in the LNG industry {{due to a lack}} of understanding of the complex interactions between the LNG vapor cloud and water droplets. This research applies computational fluid dynamics (CFD) modeling to investigate the forced dispersion of LNG vapor using upward-oriented full-cone spray nozzles. A Eulerian-Lagrangian approach was applied to simulate the energy and momentum exchange between the continuous (gas flow) and discrete (droplets) phases. Discussed are the physical parameters that are essential inputs to the CFD simulation of the water spray-LNG system. The experimental data collected from the Mary Kay O?Connor Process Safety Center?s outdoor LNG spill work in March 2009 at the Brayton Fire Training Field were used to calibrate the physical parameters. The physical mechanisms of the water spray application were investigated using LNG forced dispersion modeling. The effects of momentum imparting from the droplets to the air- vapor mixture, thermal transfer between the two phases (droplet/vapor) and effects of various levels of air entrainment rates on the behavior of the LNG vapors are evaluated. Lastly, the key parametric dependences of the design elements for an effective water curtain system are investigated. The effects of different droplet sizes, droplet temperatures, nozzle cone angles, and installation configurations of water spray applications on LNG vapor behavior are analyzed. This work aims to investigate the complex interaction of the water droplet-LNG vapor system, which will serve in developing guidelines and establishing engineering criteria for a site-specific LNG mitigation system. Finally, the potentials of applying CFD modeling in providing guidance for setting up the design criteria for an effective forced mitigation system as an integrated safety element <b>for</b> <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEmission {{reduction}} {{targets are}} driving {{a new way}} of thinking and a range of technological solutions within the shipping and port sectors. So far, four major solutions have been identified for cleaner ship fuels: (i) Marine Gas Oil, (ii) Heavy Fuel Oil + Scrubber, (iii) Liquefied Natural Gas – herein referred to as LNG, and (iv) Methanol. From those alternatives, most experts recognise LNG as the most developed fuel solution, both in the short- and in the medium-term. In 2014, the United States Energy Information Administration (EIA) as well as the International Gas Union (IGU) reported a significant growth of terminals for LNG liquefaction and regasification. Moreover, the European Commission, as part of its Clean Power for Transport package, has adopted in 2014 a Directive ‘on the deployment of alternative fuels, recharging and refuelling infrastructure’. Nevertheless, there are several constraints {{that need to be addressed}} yet, more particularly in LNG importing countries in order to meet the future demand of the expected LNG-powered fleet. They include facilities for storage and transhipment of LNG for fuelling berths, barges and ships. This paper provides an overview of the use of LNG for the maritime industry and examines its potential for future growth on the basis of the LNG-powered fleet (current and in order) and planned expansion of LNG bunkering facilities, mainly in European ports. Most data here presented come from a variety of sources including international databases such as IHS Maritime, ports websites, and reports from LNG-related organisations. In addition, the results from past and current EU-funded projects in this field were reviewed and consultations were conducted among representatives from participating ports. Overall, it was found that the LNG powered fleet is expanding slowly and the trend is towards building LNG-propelled vessels for smaller ship sizes and short distances. Although Norway is the newbuilding front runner, other countries, mainly in Europe (e. g. the Netherlands, Denmark, Italy, and Malta), have ordered an important amount of new buildings. Similarly, European ports are expanding considerably their LNG bunkering capacities. Remarkable are the activities conducted by the ports of Spain and Italy with planned expansion for LNG handling and storage facilities beyond 2020. Finally, with regards to regulations, while international standards have been adopted for the construction and operation of LNG powered ships and crew's training, no harmonisation exists yet <b>for</b> <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> in ports. The latter have allowed major ports to undertake independent initiatives to overcome the situation...|$|E

40|$|By {{the end of}} 2004, {{there were}} over sixty {{proposals}} <b>for</b> new <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> at both the producing and importing ends of the operation. Since the mid 1990 s, the costs of every step in the LNG chain have dropped substantially and today are considerably below those of domestic pipeline gas in Europe, China, and the United States. This paper examines the causes of these cost reductions and examines how the LNG industry is likely to evolve. It also explores the national security implications of the projected volume of natural gas traded {{in the form of}} LNG. The paper concludes that the financial risks inherent in the investments to liquefy, ship, and regasify LNG will force companies to continue to rely heavily on contracts, as opposed to relying on spot sales, and will advantage the larger private multinational companies. Security concerns will increase as China and the United States dramatically increase their imports of LNG, but security risks will remain less than those for oil and, as demonstrated by the Japanese experience, are manageable. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{the growth in}} the volume of LNG traded and the motivation behind offshore LNG production. Offshore <b>LNG</b> <b>facilities</b> represent billion dollar investments in new unproven technology and there are both advantages and challenges that need to be overcome. The potential business exposure is considerable and the UKOOA Ref. / 1 / framework for decision making is introduced with the aim of aiding the decision-maker in selecting techniques to aid the investment decision. The framework draws upon the abilities of Quantitative Risk Assessment (QRA) as a tool to provide unique insight to issues that affect the selection of conceptual designs. The paper uses QRA concepts to evaluate safety and business risks for a conceptual floating <b>LNG</b> <b>facility</b> and compares estimated risks with an equivalent onshore facility. The paper concludes that the floating <b>LNG</b> <b>facility</b> safety levels are comparable to those found onshore to indicate that on this basis, the concept is a plausible alternative <b>for</b> <b>LNG</b> production.

25|$|LNG is most cost {{efficiently}} {{produced in}} relatively large facilities due to economies of scale, at sites with marine access allowing regular large bulk shipments direct to market.
