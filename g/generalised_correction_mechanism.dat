Keywords: Bilinear model; Cointegration; Consumption; Exchange rates; Non-linear dynamics JEL classification: C 32 1. Introduction It is by now well known that systems in which non-stationary variables are cointegrated can be described by error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> (see, e. g., Granger, 1986; Engle and Granger, 1987). In the great majority of papers that have reported error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms,</b> an implicit assumption is that the adjustment to equilibrium is a constant proportion of the error. More recently, a number of authors (e. g., Escribano and Mira, 1996) have discussed non-linear error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> This approach involv [...] ...|$|R

Methodological issues provide {{a major focus of}} the paper. Our results favor use of full system estimation in error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> or subsystem methods that are asymptotically equivalent.

Although good designed retransmission schemes can be optimal with respect to energy efficiency, they can introduce problems to fulfill the required QoS of an application. Since the channel conditions and the requirements vary dynamically, we concentrate on adaptive implementations of error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms.</b> Error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> traditionally optimize the performance and provide an optimal solution to withstand all possible errors.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Building {{innovation}} {{literature and}} policy documents state that public clients should evaluate bids {{on the highest}} value-price ratio, but as an ongoing investigation into Economically Most Advantageous Tender (EMAT) award mechanisms applied in the Dutch construction industry shows, in practice hardly any mechanism exists that explicitly defines {{the total value of}} offers. This paper investigates that discrepancy for the so-called price <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> by mapping it into the value-price model. Therefore the two options of preference determination, namely value minus price or value divided by price, need to be explored. The result of this procedure is the conclusion that with the current price <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> the total value is determined in an implicit way, {{and that it would be}} better to determine the total value of offers explicitly. Furthermore it becomes evident that with price <b>correction</b> <b>mechanisms</b> preference is based on value minus price rather than value divided by price, which is strange from a theoretical point of view...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is the {{development}} of models for converging economies. After discussing models of balanced growth, univariate models of the gap between per capital income in two economies are examined. The preferred models combine unobserved components with an error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> and allow a decomposition into trend, cycle and convergence components. A new type of second-order error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> is shown to be particularly useful in this respect. The levels of per capita income in two economies may be modelled jointly by bivariate convergence models. These models generalise balanced growth models and can be based on autoregressive or unobserved components formulations. Both approaches provide coherent forecasts but the unobserved components models also yield a description of trends, cycles and convergence components. The methods are applied to data on the US and Japan. The generalisation to multivariate series is then set out. cycles, balanced growth, error <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism,</b> stochastic trend, unobserved components...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} seeks to explore degree of market {{integration}} and price transmission in major onion markets of Pakistan using Co-integration technique and Error <b>Correction</b> <b>Mechanism</b> (ECM). Average monthly wholesale prices (January 2000 -December 2009) of four onion markets Lahore, Hyderabad, Peshawar, and Quetta {{were used for}} analysis. The findings of the study revealed that selected four major onion markets were integrated with each other. The results of Error <b>Correction</b> <b>Mechanism</b> for pair of onion markets showed that 5 to 28. 5 percent of the disequilibrium was removed each time period i. e. one month. This implies that following one standard error shock to the selected markets which cause disequilibrium, economic agents take 3 to 4 months to adjust the disequilibrium and move back to long run equilibrium. These findings were supported {{with the results of}} Granger causality analysis which confirmed the presence of co-integrating relationship among the variables. The high degree of market integration observed in this case is consistent with the view that onion markets in Pakistan are linked with each other for price transmission and related physical arbitrage.

A <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> including two piezoelectric actuators was constructed and installed between double nuts. The <b>correction</b> <b>mechanism</b> corrects positioning error if both piezoelectric actuators are expanded to the same length, and corrects angular error if one piezoelectric actuator is expanded {{and the other is}} contracted. First, the positioning and angular errors correction functions were investigated separately. A load was applied {{to one side of the}} table in order to simulate a counter force during machining. In the positioning error correction, a low-frequency component of positioning error was corrected effectively under the condition that the load for the table was set to at least 50 N. In the angular error correction, the correction capability was comparable to that of the positioning error correction up to the maximum load torque to the table, 1. 4 Nm. The load torque was limited to 1. 4 Nm because both piezoelectric actuators reached their saturation voltage. Finally, simultaneous correction of positioning error and angular error was examined, and the simultaneous correction capability was confirmed to be equivalent to the separate correction capabilities...|$|R
