40|$|Over {{the past}} year we have {{researched}} {{the development of a}} network-based real-time laser-based nonintrusive field-deployable detection for the delineation of moving vehicles. The primary goal of this project is to develop a roadway detection system {{that can be used to}} gather reliable travel time data non-intrusively. A powerful Rabbit 3200, instead of multi-microchips, is used to <b>control</b> <b>digitally</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>potentiometers</b> (DCP), which adjust the gain of the sensors' signals. Utilizing <b>digitally</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>potentiometers</b> allow for quick and easy adjustment on the highway with only the need of pushing a button. The adjustment, which used to take half or an hour, now only takes several seconds. The Rabbit 3200 is also used as a data sender to a computer through the Ethernet. The rabbit digital input ports are triggered to collect the signals by an interrupt pulse from a PWM signal, which also acts as the laser source trigger. The Rabbit 3200 will then pack all of the data into TCP packages and send them to a remote computer over a network. The Rabbit 3200 is also able to filter noise after having finished the task of adjustment. The software of the system has been modified for 8 channels. Compared with the previous 4 channel code, the new system is able to obtain more information on vehicles, including the profile of a passing vehicle. In order to improve the precision of the system, we improved the mechanical design, optical design and electric circuit design. We also use an interrupt to sample signals instead of a fixed sampling interval strategy. This method ensures every signal generated by the APD will be captured by the Rabbit 3200. The laser sources are pulsed at 10 kHz and the sampling rate of the Rabbit 3200 is synchronized to the 10 kHz laser pulse. This report describes the design and implementation of each functional component of the field-deployable system, the configuration of the field detection system, software design and implementation, and a signal calibration method to obtain higher system precision. It also demonstrates four different ways to test the field-deployable system and the results from each way of testing for future improvement. ...|$|R
40|$|The diploma thesis {{deals with}} the modern design of the control {{circuits}} for digital potentiometers and their application in analog systems. The concept of the digital control is demonstrated on the electronically controlled active 2 -nd order filter and programmable oscillator. The proposed design of the active filter describes a programmable active 2 -nd order filter Sallen-Key. In this circuit it is possible independently programme cut-off frequency, Q factor and type of approximation with very good accuracy. The circuits of the designed filter and designed oscillator are simulated in PSpice (OrCAD), parasite effects and effects of the real parts are studied. Properties simulated circuits are compare with experimental results. These results appreciate quality and efficiency of the <b>digitally</b> <b>controlled</b> <b>potentiometers</b> in dependence on variable input circuit parameters.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{presents}} a portable <b>digitally</b> <b>controlled</b> oscillator (DCO) by using two-input NOR gates as a <b>digitally</b> <b>controlled</b> varactor (DCV) in fine-tuning delay cell design. This novel varactor uses the gate capacitance difference of NOR gates under different digital control inputs {{to establish a}} DCV. Thus proposed DCO can improve delay resolution 256 times better than a single buffer design. This study also examines different types of NOR/NAND gates (2 -input or 3 -input) for DCV. The proposed DCO with novel DCV can be implemented with standard cells, and thus it can be ported to different processes in short time. Furthermore, the final circuit layout can be generated using an auto placement and routing (APR) tools. A test chip demonstrates that LSB resolution of the DCO can be improved to 1. 55 ps with standard 0. 35 - m 2 P 4 M CMOS digital cell library. The proposed DCO has good performance in terms of fine resolution, high portability, and short design turnaround cycle compared with conventional DCO designs.
