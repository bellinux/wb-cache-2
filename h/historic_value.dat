Many pillboxes still exist, {{especially}} on the north eastern part of the island. A few of them have been restored and are cared for, but many others were demolished. Some pillboxes are still being destroyed as they are not considered to have any architectural or <b>historic</b> <b>value.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 1952, the {{two couples}} {{discovered}} that Red House {{was up for}} sale, and as architects {{with an interest in}} Morris, they recognised its <b>historic</b> <b>value.</b> By this point, the Red House had been empty for 18 months, after Thomas Hills and his family had left in 1951, and had fallen into a state of dilapidation. Deciding to share the property between themselves, they were able to afford a mortgage {{with the aid of a}} loan from Toms' father-in-law; he only agreed to provide the loan if the house was owned in Toms' name, and thus the Hollambys became Toms' tenants. The two families then moved in with their six children, and a seventh was born soon after. They camped in the house's grounds while carrying out a project of renovation.|$|E
5|$|In 2008, {{an article}} in The Day stated that the push to restore the house came from {{conservation}} specialist Doug Royalty, who was researching prefabricated homes from the 1920s and 1930s. Royalty approached Abigail Van Slyck, the chairwoman of Connecticut College's art history department and architectural studies program about the house. The Day referred to the house's <b>historic</b> <b>value</b> as a new discovery, but its history {{was included in the}} Winslow Ames House National Register of Historic Places nomination in 1995. The Winslow Ames House nomination detailed the House's origin, but criticized its gable roof modification. After its re-discovery, Connecticut College began collecting grants to restore the house under the direction of Royalty and Van Slyck. Royalty stated that the House and Winslow Ames House are very rare, with only a few surviving examples in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Today, {{conservation}} {{work in our}} built {{cultural heritage}} has to be reformulated due to the new energy efficiency requirements put forward. On both a national and an international level, energy efficiency measures are considered key actions within sustainability work, answering to the global issue of climate change. What does this imply for our built heritage? Contemporary conservation {{is characterized by the}} concept of sustainability, and integrated conservation is also expected to be sustainable. It is inherent in this tradition, but {{how are we going to}} balance the <b>historic</b> and architectural <b>values</b> with the new energy requirements? A research project, Energy Efficiency in Our Cultural Heritage (EEPOCH), consisting of a multiple case study, has been carried out over three years, studying selected objects restored within the Halland Model, a project over a decade long. In EEPOCH the multiple units of analysis are energy efficiency, <b>historic</b> and architectural <b>values,</b> management, and legislation. All are applied to the selected objects. The results and conclusions drawn from the analysis show that there are actions that are possible to take and to recommend, including national inventories of <b>historic</b> <b>values</b> in the existing building stock as well as guidance for the management of <b>historic</b> <b>values</b> on a municipal level for continued sustainable development...|$|R
