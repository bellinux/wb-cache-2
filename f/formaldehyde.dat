5|$|Over {{the next}} decade, megamasers were also {{discovered}} for <b>formaldehyde</b> (H2CO) and methine (CH). Galactic <b>formaldehyde</b> masers are relatively rare, and more <b>formaldehyde</b> megamasers are known than are galactic <b>formaldehyde</b> masers. Methine masers, {{on the other}} hand, are quite common in the Milky Way. Both types of megamaser were found in galaxies in which hydroxyl had been detected. Methine is seen in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption, while <b>formaldehyde</b> is found in galaxies with hydroxyl absorption {{as well as those}} with hydroxyl megamaser emission.|$|E
5|$|Generally, in {{cabinets}} or {{display cases}} that are entirely or partially made of wood, the hydrolysis of acetyl groups in the wood hemicelluloses creates acetic acid. The {{rate at which the}} acetic acid is produced is proportional to the concentration of esters in the wood, the humidity, the temperature, and the overall acidity of the environment. Acidic fumes can also be released from <b>formaldehyde</b> which can occur in wood as a degradation product of lignin. Acidic fumes can also be given off from ubiquitous <b>formaldehyde</b> resins (commonly urea-formaldehyde resins).|$|E
5|$|Observations {{during a}} flyby on March 12, 2008, {{revealed}} additional {{chemicals in the}} plume, including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane, propane, acetylene and <b>formaldehyde.</b> The plumes' composition, {{as measured by the}} INMS, is similar to that seen at most comets.|$|E
5|$|Small {{quantities}} of methane and <b>formaldehyde</b> detected by Mars orbiters are both {{claimed to be}} possible evidence for life, as these chemical compounds would quickly break down in the Martian atmosphere. Alternatively, these compounds may instead be replenished by volcanic or other geological means, such as serpentinization.|$|E
5|$|The Mars Orbiter Mission by India {{is searching}} for methane in the atmosphere, while the ExoMars Trace Gas Orbiter, {{launched}} in 2016, would further study the methane {{as well as its}} decomposition products, such as <b>formaldehyde</b> and methanol.|$|E
5|$|Using modern catalysts, this {{reaction}} {{can have an}} acetic acid yield greater than 95%. The major side-products are ethyl acetate, formic acid, and <b>formaldehyde,</b> {{all of which have}} lower boiling points than acetic acid and are readily separated by distillation.|$|E
5|$|For {{those with}} {{recurrent}} infections, taking a short course of antibiotics when each infection occurs {{is associated with}} the lowest antibiotic use. A prolonged course of daily antibiotics is also effective. Medications frequently used include nitrofurantoin and trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole (TMP/SMX). Methenamine is another agent used for this purpose as in the bladder where the acidity is low it produces <b>formaldehyde</b> to which resistance does not develop. Some recommend against prolonged use due to concerns of antibiotic resistance.|$|E
5|$|Several {{chemical}} tests {{have been documented}} that can help confirm the identify of this species. On the cap flesh, application of <b>formaldehyde</b> turns the tissue pinkish, iron salts result in a colour change to greyish-green, aniline causes a lavender to reddish-brown colour, and phenol a purplish pink to reddish brown. On the cap cuticle, nitric acid causes an orange-salmon colour, sulphuric acid creates orange-red, ammonia usually makes brown, and a potassium hydroxide solution usually makes orange.|$|E
5|$|Even on a {{habitable}} {{planet with}} enough radioisotopes to heat its interior, various prebiotic molecules are required {{in order to}} produce life; therefore, the distribution of these molecules in the galaxy is important in determining the galactic habitable zone. A 2008 study by Samantha Blair and colleagues attempted to determine {{the outer edge of the}} galactic habitable zone by means of analyzing <b>formaldehyde</b> and carbon monoxide emissions from various giant molecular clouds scattered throughout the Milky Way; however, the data is neither conclusive nor complete.|$|E
5|$|In {{the first}} case, acetic acid reacts with the calcium {{carbonate}} (one {{of the main}} components of freshwater, marine and land shells, birds' eggs and other such specimens) producing calcium acetate, a salt. <b>Formaldehyde</b> can be oxidized by the oxygen in air to create formic acid, which then has basically the same effects as acetic acid, reacting with calcium carbonate to produce a salt. The salts (calcium acetate and calcium formate) crystallize through the specimen's outer surface, destroying its fine detail and exposing more areas for further reaction. As the condition progresses, the salt crystals build up over the specimen's surface, which becomes increasingly eroded.|$|E
5|$|Sigurður {{has used}} a variety of {{techniques}} to preserve the penises, including preservation in <b>formaldehyde,</b> pickling, drying, stuffing and salting. One particularly large penis taken from a bull has been converted into a walking stick. Many of the museum's exhibits are illuminated by lamps made by Sigurður from rams' testicles. Sigurður has also carved wooden phalluses, which can be found adorning various objects around the museum, and has a bow tie decorated with images of phalluses that he wears on special occasions.|$|E
5|$|Silver metal {{is a good}} {{catalyst}} for oxidation reactions; {{in fact it is}} somewhat too good for most purposes, as finely divided silver tends to result in complete oxidation of organic substances to carbon dioxide and water, and hence coarser-grained silver tends to be used instead. For instance, 15% silver supported on α-Al2O3 or silicates is a {{catalyst for}} the oxidation of ethylene to ethylene oxide at 230–270°C. Dehydrogenation of methanol to <b>formaldehyde</b> is conducted at 600–720°C over silver gauze or crystals as the catalyst, as is dehydrogenation of isopropanol to acetone. In the gas phase, glycol yields glyoxal and ethanol yields acetaldehyde, while organic amines are dehydrated to nitriles.|$|E
5|$|The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame paid $6,000 to {{taxidermist}} Sergio Vigilato {{to preserve}} the dress. It had been frozen following the two television appearances, although Vigilato discovered signs of decomposition on the dress which had occurred prior to it being frozen, and noted it was emitting an odor once it was defrosted. It was treated with bleach, <b>formaldehyde</b> and detergent to kill any bacteria which had formed, and was reconditioned by being dyed dark red once it was preserved so {{to give it the}} same appearance as when first worn. However, after the preservation there were several pieces of beef left over and not included in the reworked dress.|$|E
5|$|The {{standard}} {{conditions for the}} Weinreb–Nahm ketone synthesis are known to tolerate {{a wide variety of}} functional groups elsewhere in the molecule, including alpha-halogen substitution, N-protected amino acids, α-β unsaturation, silyl ethers, various lactams and lactones, sulfonates, sulfinates, and phosphonate esters. A wide variety of nucleophiles can be used in conjunction with the amide. Lithiates and Grignard reagents are most commonly employed; examples involving aliphatic, vinyl, aryl, and alkynyl carbon nucleophiles have been reported. However, with highly basic or sterically hindered nucleophiles, elimination of the methoxide moiety to release <b>formaldehyde</b> can occur as a significant side reaction.|$|E
5|$|The {{surface of}} the nucleus is {{generally}} dry, dusty or rocky, suggesting that the ices are hidden beneath a surface crust several metres thick. In addition to the gases already mentioned, the nuclei contain a variety of organic compounds, which may include methanol, hydrogen cyanide, <b>formaldehyde,</b> ethanol, and ethane and perhaps more complex molecules such as long-chain hydrocarbons and amino acids. In 2009, {{it was confirmed that}} the amino acid glycine had been found in the comet dust recovered by NASA's Stardust mission. In August 2011, a report, based on NASA studies of meteorites found on Earth, was published suggesting DNA and RNA components (adenine, guanine, and related organic molecules) may have been formed on asteroids and comets.|$|E
5|$|In 1896, Cope began {{suffering}} from a gastrointestinal illness he said was cystitis. His wife cared for him in Philadelphia when she was able; at other times, Cope's university secretary, Anna Brown, tended to him. Cope at this time lived in his Pine Street museum and rested on a cot surrounded by his fossil finds. Cope often prescribed himself medications, including large amounts of morphine, belladonna, and formalin, a substance based on <b>formaldehyde</b> used to preserve specimens. Osborn was horrified by Cope's actions and made arrangements for surgery, but the plans were put on hold after a temporary improvement in Cope's health. Cope went to Virginia looking for fossils, became ill again, {{and returned to his}} home very weak. Osborn visited Cope on April 5, inquiring about Cope's health, but the sick paleontologist pressed his friend for his views on the origin of mammals. Word of Cope's illness spread, and he was visited by friends and colleagues; even in a feverish condition Cope delivered lectures from his bed. Cope died on April 12, 1897, 16 weeks short of his 57th birthday.|$|E
5|$|Infectious {{particles}} possessing {{nucleic acid}} are dependent upon it to direct their continued replication. Prions, however, are infectious by {{their effect on}} normal versions of the protein. Sterilizing prions, therefore, requires the denaturation of the protein to a state in which the molecule is {{no longer able to}} induce the abnormal folding of normal proteins. In general, prions are quite resistant to proteases, heat, ionizing radiation, and <b>formaldehyde</b> treatments, although their infectivity can be reduced by such treatments. Effective prion decontamination relies upon protein hydrolysis or reduction or destruction of protein tertiary structure. Examples include sodium hypochlorite, sodium hydroxide, and strongly acidic detergents such as LpH. 134°C (274°F) for 18 minutes in a pressurized steam autoclave {{has been found to be}} somewhat effective in deactivating the agent of disease. Ozone sterilization is currently being studied as a potential method for prion denaturation and deactivation. Renaturation of a completely denatured prion to infectious status has not yet been achieved; however, partially denatured prions can be renatured to an infective status under certain artificial conditions.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> is {{a common}} {{precursor}} to more complex compounds and materials. In approximate order of decreasing consumption, products generated from <b>formaldehyde</b> include urea <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, melamine resin, phenol <b>formaldehyde</b> resin, polyoxymethylene plastics, 1,4-butanediol, and methylene diphenyl diisocyanate. The textile industry uses formaldehyde-based resins as finishers to make fabrics crease-resistant. Formaldehyde-based materials are key to the manufacture of automobiles, and used to make components for the transmission, electrical system, engine block, door panels, axles and brake shoes. The value of sales of <b>formaldehyde</b> and derivative products was over $145 billion in 2003, about 1.2% {{of the gross domestic}} product (GDP) of the United States and Canada. Including indirect employment, over 4 million people work in the <b>formaldehyde</b> industry across approximately 11,900 plants in the U.S. and Canada.|$|E
25|$|An aqueous {{solution}} of <b>formaldehyde</b> {{can be useful}} as a disinfectant as it kills most bacteria and fungi (including their spores). <b>Formaldehyde</b> solutions are applied topically in medicine to dry the skin, {{such as in the}} treatment of warts. Many aquarists use <b>formaldehyde</b> as a treatment for the parasites Ichthyophthirius multifiliis and Cryptocaryon irritans.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} bacterial products for toxoid vaccines. <b>Formaldehyde</b> is also used {{to inactivate}} unwanted viruses and kill bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> {{levels in}} {{building}} environments {{are affected by}} a number of factors. These include the potency of formaldehyde-emitting products present, the ratio of the surface area of emitting materials to volume of space, environmental factors, product age, interactions with other materials, and ventilation condition. <b>Formaldehyde</b> emits from a variety of construction materials, furnishings, and consumer products. The three products that emit the highest concentrations are medium density fiberboard, hardwood plywood, and particle board. Environmental factors such as temperature and relative humidity can elevate levels because <b>formaldehyde</b> has a high vapor pressure. <b>Formaldehyde</b> levels from building materials are the highest when a building first opens because materials would have less time to off-gas. <b>Formaldehyde</b> levels decrease over time as the sources suppress.|$|E
25|$|Glutaraldehyde and <b>formaldehyde</b> {{solutions}} (also used as fixatives) {{are accepted}} liquid sterilizing agents, {{provided that the}} immersion time is sufficiently long. To kill all spores in a clear liquid {{can take up to}} 22 hours with glutaraldehyde and even longer with <b>formaldehyde.</b> The presence of solid particles may lengthen the required period or render the treatment ineffective. Sterilization of blocks of tissue can take much longer, due to the time required for the fixative to penetrate. Glutaraldehyde and <b>formaldehyde</b> are volatile, and toxic by both skin contact and inhalation. Glutaraldehyde has a short shelf life (<2 weeks), and is expensive. <b>Formaldehyde</b> is less expensive and has a much longer shelf life if some methanol is added to inhibit polymerization to paraformaldehyde, but is much more volatile. <b>Formaldehyde</b> is also used as a gaseous sterilizing agent; in this case, it is prepared on-site by depolymerization of solid paraformaldehyde. Many vaccines, such as the original Salk polio vaccine, are sterilized with <b>formaldehyde.</b>|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> {{inhalation}} {{has also}} shown to cause oxidative stress and inflammation in animals. Mice studied over an exposure to a high dose of <b>formaldehyde</b> (3ppm), showed increased NO levels in plasma. This result suggests that FA inhalation either decreased NO production or increased NO scavenging, which may be an anti-stress mechanism in the body. <b>Formaldehyde</b> inhalation changes the sensitivity of immune system, which influences oxidative stress.|$|E
25|$|There {{are several}} web {{articles}} claiming that <b>formaldehyde</b> has been banned from manufacture or import into the European Union (EU) under REACH (Registration, Evaluation, Authorization, and restriction of Chemical substances) legislation. This {{appears to be}} misinformation, as official EU chemical databases contradict these claims as of February 19, 2010. This misconception has gained some ground. <b>Formaldehyde</b> is not listed in the Annex I of Regulation (EC) No 689/2008 (export and import of dangerous chemicals regulation), nor on a priority list for risk assessment. However, <b>formaldehyde</b> is banned from use in certain applications (preservatives for liquid-cooling and processing systems, slimicides, metalworking-fluid preservatives, and antifouling products) under the Biocidal Products Directive. In the EU, the maximum allowed concentration of <b>formaldehyde</b> in finished products is 0.2%, and any product that exceeds 0.05% has to include a warning that the product contains <b>formaldehyde.</b>|$|E
25|$|Interstellar <b>formaldehyde</b> {{was first}} {{discovered}} in 1969 by Lewis Snyder, David Buhl, B. Zuckerman and Patrick Palmer using the National Radio Astronomy Observatory. <b>Formaldehyde</b> {{was detected by}} means of the 111 - 110 ground state rotational transition at 4830MHz.|$|E
25|$|Processes in {{the upper}} {{atmosphere}} contribute up to 90% of the total <b>formaldehyde</b> in the environment. <b>Formaldehyde</b> is an intermediate in the oxidation (or combustion) of methane, {{as well as of}} other carbon compounds, e.g. in forest fires, automobile exhaust, and tobacco smoke. When produced in the atmosphere by the action of sunlight and oxygen on atmospheric methane and other hydrocarbons, it becomes part of smog. <b>Formaldehyde</b> has also been detected in outer space (see below).|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> {{does not}} {{accumulate}} in the environment, {{because it is}} broken down {{within a few hours}} by sunlight or by bacteria present in soil or water. Humans metabolize <b>formaldehyde</b> quickly, so it does not accumulate, converting it to formic acid in the body.|$|E
25|$|<b>Formaldehyde</b> {{is used to}} {{inactivate}} bacterial products for toxoid vaccines (vaccines that use an inactive bacterial toxin to produce immunity). It {{is also used to}} kill unwanted viruses and bacteria that might contaminate the vaccine during production. Urinary tract infections are also often treated using a derivative of <b>formaldehyde</b> (methenamine), a method often chosen because it prevents overuse of antibiotics and the resultant development of bacterial resistance to them. In an acid environment, methenamine is converted in the kidneys to <b>formaldehyde,</b> which then has an antibacterial effect in the urinary tract. Some topical creams, cosmetics, and personal hygiene products contain derivatives of <b>formaldehyde</b> as the active ingredients that prevent the growth of potentially harmful bacteria.|$|E

25|$|The <b>formaldehyde</b> {{surrounding}} the shark, Hirst says, {{is the process}} of death and decay. Though <b>formaldehyde</b> is used as a preservation means, over time, the object being preserved will soon wilt, flake, and wrinkle. Because the sculpture itself was made in 1991, the shark is very much rotting and deformed due to the <b>formaldehyde</b> taking its toll on the corpse. With the corpse rotting away, it symbolizes that no matter how well we take care of ourselves or how timeless we think we are, our mind will start to fade away and we slowly will begin to forget.|$|E
25|$|A resin {{used for}} making non-wrinkle shirts {{releases}} <b>formaldehyde,</b> which could cause contact dermatitis {{for some people}} - particularly those who have already developed an allergy; no disclosure requirements exist, and in 2008 the U.S. Government Accountability Office tested <b>formaldehyde</b> in clothing and found that generally the highest levels were in non-wrinkle shirts and pants.|$|E
25|$|The {{principal}} carbon-containing {{products of}} incomplete ethane combustion are single-carbon compounds such as carbon monoxide and <b>formaldehyde.</b> One important route {{by which the}} carbon-carbon bond in ethane is broken, to yield these single-carbon products, is the decomposition of the ethoxy radical into a methyl radical and <b>formaldehyde,</b> which can in turn undergo further oxidation.|$|E
25|$|Studies on the {{interactions}} between <b>formaldehyde</b> and proteins {{at the molecular level}} have been reported on the effects of the body’s carrier protein, serum albumin. The binding of <b>formaldehyde</b> loosens the skeletal structure of albumin and exposure of aromatic ring amino acids in the internal hydrophobic region. Symptoms may affect personal awareness, making one feel tired or fatigued.|$|E
