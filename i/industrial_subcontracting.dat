While less pervasive than on the mainland, <b>industrial</b> <b>subcontracting</b> is a vital component in Hokkaido's space economy and it is found in every industrial sector. To explain the relations between small and large firms two conceptual models are introduced: dualism and flexible production.

The choice of ownership structure involves a trade-off between minimizing holdup risk and spreading natural risk. Concentrating ownership under one party reduces her exposure to holdup but increases her exposure to environmental uncertainty. Using data on Mexican apparel subcontracting, the author finds evidence that supports the model: the share of production subcontracted is high in market segments where demand is highly variable and low in market segments where manufacturers make large relationship-specific investments.

40|$|<b>Industrial</b> <b>subcontracting,</b> outcontracting and {{networking}} between firms has generated {{a lot of}} attention in the field of research. This attention is quite understandable because it reflects a number of important developments in the international restructuring of the economy. However, not all aspects of industrial networking have been given equal attention. Most research deals with the description and explanation of the marketing and organisational aspects of networking - financial and technical - for the firms involved. In contrast to this, very little attention is paid to the spatial and cultural aspects of industrial networking. In this study a combination of both fields of interest is made in which organisational as well as cultural, spatial and also policy aspects of industrial networking are included. The study is built up in two parts. In the first part, consisting of chapter 1 through 4, the infuence of physical distance on the â€™birthâ€™ and functioning of subcontracting-outcontractingand network-relations is the central topic. In the second part, consisting of chapter 5 through 9, not only physical distance, but also other influencing factors like trust, regional culture and personal background of decision makers are dealt with. In this way, a broad overview of factors influencing industrial relations is obtained which can help to understand the spatial organisation of these relations. ...|$|E

By improving the competitiveness of the price-sensitive segment, the strategy contributed to the successful expansion of the Group until 2002. However, high range products, manufactured in Italy, record decreasing sales especially on the US market, despite the companys efforts in R&D and marketing and its investments in information technology.

40|$|Changing {{forms of}} {{subcontracting}} and especially vertically disintegrated supply chains {{have been a}} central issue in the management and purchasing literature during the 1990 â€™s. The movement has had its origins in the Japanese industry (see e. g. Kidd 1995, Hines 1995, 1996) and the â€™Japanese approach â€™ has given a rise to concepts such as Just-in-time production (JIT), total quality management (TQM) and lean production. However, a growing Western interest in similar organisational strategies has also lead to restructuring of <b>industrial</b> <b>subcontracting</b> systems. The most influential engines of change are large â€™postmodern â€™ global corporations. â€™Fluid, flexible and adaptive â€™ large organisations stick to their core competencies or core intellectual and service capabilities (Koivisto, Ahmaniemi and Koski 1999). For a small subcontractor company this restructuring means taking more risk and responsibility over the production of complete deliveries for the customer organisation. This, in turn, creates new types of subcontracting models. This study concentrates on the restructuring of subcontractor relationships within the Finnish Electronics industry, focusing especially on the acquisition of software. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to discuss how the â€™trend â€™ of increasing the level of outsourcing and thus pushing risk and responsibility downwards in the supply chain has been applied to the acquisition of software development.

Qualitative Descriptive Research of Creative Management Process and Employment Relations in the Creative Industries of T-shirt in the Sleman District, Yogyakarta. Faculty of Social and Political Sciences, University of Sebelas Maret Surakarta. The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} is to know about the creative process of production management and marketing in t-shirtâ€™s industries and know about working relationship in the creative industries of t-shirt and how to maintain and develop the continuity of t-shirt business. This research used qualitative methods in exploring data, through in depth interview and direct observation. The primary data obtained from some interviews. This research used triangulation of data to test the validity of data by using something other than data such as picture documentation. Triangulation reflects an attempt to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} researchâ€™s phenomenon. The researchâ€™s sampling is through purposive sampling which is the sample choose deliberately to finding what is in accordance with the purpose of the research. From this research can be concluded that the creative process of production and marketing management by the creative industries of t-shirt is a creative process and art in creating the aesthetic value products. The process include how the existing design concept will be used on t-shirt, but this process do not stop at the concept or just an idea. The concept or idea must be realized and used by society. The meaning is the creative industries should pay attention to the values in society while creating the designâ€™s concept. Then, there are forms of subcontract relationship in the creative industries of t-shirt. There are commercial subcontracting relationship between FIBERS company as the principal with RUSTER company as the subcontractor company. Fibers subcontracting its production to Ruster because Fibers has not factor of production such as production equipment and manpower in t-shirt production. Then, there are <b>industrial</b> <b>subcontracting</b> relationship between MCK company as a sub contractor with DEMON. INC as a principal. DEMON. INC subcontract their production because they do nonâ€™t have the factor of production such as production equipment and manpower in t-shirt production. In addition, the creative industries of t-shirt have patron and client relationships. Patron and client relationship happens because employees who work in FIBERS company is co-entrepreneur who lives around the same business environment. In this case, the entrepreneur is the patron who has the business assets and employees is a client who works on entrepreneur...|$|E

40|$|A close {{examination}} of the organisation of the clothing industry in Thailand exhibits a rather paradoxical situation: although the structural features of the sector - the breaking down of the production process, high labour intensity, low asset specificity, low skilled labour - seem to legitimate a market co-ordination mechanism, it is a close, durable and multiform co-operation which cements, in Thailand, the relations between contractors and subcontractors, {{as well as between}} subcontractors themselves. We defend the idea that this kind of co-operative organisation of economic activities represents an appropriate answer to the flexibility required by ever changing markets. Co-operation is here understood as a mechanism of temporal co-ordination of economic activities which, far from substituting itself to the market co-ordination mechanism, rather completes it.

The focus on both institutional setting and interfirm relationships is essential in regions undergoing rapid change. In the article we also use Burt's concept of structural holes and the idea of a competence-difficulty gap to examine the nature of relationships within networks of firms, arguing that global integration {{can be viewed as a}} bridging process.

40|$|Purpose of the paper: Italian {{firms are}} {{increasingly}} drawn {{to modify their}} own competitive positioning. Traditional network relations, such as <b>industrial</b> districts or <b>subcontracting</b> value chains, are not themselves sufficient to generate this repositioning, since they are not designed to achieve a strategic goal, but tend to emerge spontaneously. We focus on an evolutionary path, empirically drawn from two case studies, leading {{to the definition of}} strategic network, i. e., an aggregation resulting from joint projects designed to manage the shift of partner firms towards an higher value-added segment of the value chain. Methodology: This paper analyzes the formal network contract as an empirical phenomenon capturing the theoretical concept of strategic network. It does so investigating the case of network contracts flourished in the area of Brescia. Findings: Strategic networks analyzed via two network contracts showed that different strategies exist to exploit value from the diversity of member firms; risks can arise from this diversity; risks can be tackled by means of proper governance mechanisms. Research limits: The analysis is focused on two representative cases. Undoubtedly, enriching this analysis with the observation of networks embedded in other areas would enhance and enrich the discussion raised in the article. Practical implications: The article analyzes the problems tackled, the strategies used, and the solutions selected by the network actors embedded in a network-intensive area (Brescia province). The idea is that these networks can act as a models for other entrepreneurs who want to build new networks or promote the existing ones. Originality of the study: The emergence of networks by means of formal network contracts remains largely unexplored. The analysis highlights the critical issues and the great potential of this instrument...|$|R
40|$|This study elucidated {{the spatial}} {{structure}} of interfirm linkages of the electronics industry in Japan {{in terms of}} the production system of a large manufacturer. First, a case core firm of the electronics industry was selected. Second, interfirm linkages of the core firm and its suppliers were examined based on the field survey in existing and new industrial agglomeration areas. Third, regional implications of the core firm 2 Ì† 7 s production systems were interpreted through interfirm linkages in both areas. In an existing industrial agglomeration area, the core firm 2 Ì† 7 s interfirm linkages covered wide areas of eastern Japan. The core firm depended its subcontracting on many suppliers with specialized technology in this area. These suppliers achieved spatial divisions of labor between metropolitan and non-metropolitan regions through establishing branch plants. The core firm could build a flexible production system through selecting such suppliers. In a new industrial agglomeration area,the core firm formed local linkages,while it depended its specialized technology on non-local linkages in different parts of Japan. Because of less industrialization in this area,there were few local suppliers to entrust core firm 2 Ì† 7 s subcontracting. The core firm supported bringing up local suppliers to reduce labor costs. Local suppliers could not acquire a wider range of technology because of exclusive transactions with the core firm. Non-local linkages for specialized technology were sustained. The core firm attempted to achieve a flexible and efficient production system. The core firm 2 Ì† 7 s production system implied the hierarchical and spatial organization of suppliers based on the degree of suppliers 2 Ì† 7 agglomeration in different regions.
