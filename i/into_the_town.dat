About half a mile (0.8km) north of this junction, US 5 leaves Main Street to go on Prospect Hill Road, bypassing the Warehouse Point area. There is also a partial interchange with I-91 in this area (at exit 44).

In the rural backdrop north of Jones Crossing, NY205 intersects with CR45's western terminus. The parallel alignments of NY205 and CR11 end {{a short distance}} to the north in the hamlet of Hartwick as CR11 enters the community on the east–west Main Street and intersects NY205 in the hamlet's center. CR11 leaves NY205 for good outside of Hartwick, continuing on a generally easterly track toward Cooperstown, while NY205 passes Hartwick Town Park and crosses over Otego Creek as it heads northward <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>town</b> of Otsego.|$|E
