5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various places around the ship, including the main <b>deck,</b> <b>superstructure,</b> and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E

500|$|Hōshō {{was planned}} as a {{seaplane}} carrier like the British [...] with a forward flying-off deck, 32 aircraft, four low-angle [...] guns, and four anti-aircraft (AA) guns. The plan was revised after reports were received from Japanese observers with the Royal Navy in Europe about the desirability {{to be able}} to land aircraft on the ship. The new requirements were modeled on [...] after she received her rear flight deck in 1918. The ship was to be capable of [...] and fitted with a forward flight <b>deck,</b> <b>superstructure</b> and funnels amidships, and a large hangar aft. Shortly thereafter based on observations of landing trials on Furious and , the world's first flush-decked aircraft carrier, Hōshō's flight deck design was revised in April 1919. The superstructure was removed and the funnels were moved to one side to create an unobstructed, full-length flight deck, and the ship was reclassified as an aircraft carrier. The ship's hull was based on that of a large cruiser and she was given a small island. Her three funnels were mounted on the starboard side and swiveled to lie horizontal during flight operations. Hōshōs designed speed was reduced to , based on British experiences during World War I.|$|E

A prominent feature of the bridge is the main span which is 105m long supported by two pairs of diagonal reinforced concrete struts founded on abutments 170m apart. The reinforced concrete deck together with two pairs of inclined supports at eastern and western sides of the river form a rigid frame structure. The two spans {{on the eastern side}} have a total length of 110m and this section of deck is supported by vertical columns 45m from the end.

50|$|The air inlets {{of the gas}} {{turbines}} were optimised to minimise any turbulence and back flow of the exhaust gas on deck and living areas. The bottom of the hull is solid fibreglass.

The <b>deck</b> <b>superstructure</b> is made of a carbon frame to which glass panels are glued. The glass is composed of Lexan and a triple laminate of glass. The interior bulkheads and cabin soles carry no structural loads, so they are made of thin wood and laminate veneer skins with cores.

50|$|Multihulls use {{flotation}} and/or weight positioned {{away from}} the centre line of the sailboat to counter {{the force of the}} wind. This is in contrast to heavy ballast that can account for up to 90% (in extreme cases like AC boats) of the weight of a monohull sailboat. In the case of a standard catamaran, there are two similarly-sized and -shaped slender hulls connected by beams, which are sometimes overlaid by a <b>deck</b> <b>superstructure.</b> Another catamaran variation is the proa. In the case of trimarans, which have an unballasted centre hull similar to a monohull, two smaller amas are situated parallel to the centre hull to resist the sideways force of the wind. The advantage of multihulled sailboats is that they do not suffer the performance penalty of having to carry heavy ballast, and their relatively lesser draft reduces the amount of drag, caused by friction and inertia when moving through the water.|$|E
50|$|The 1,300 metre long {{elevated}} road consists of 30 spans of 35 m precast concrete segments erected using a specially fabricated launching girder and strand jack.

The pedestrian and vehicular underpass on Western Express Highway in Vile Parle is 45 metres long, and the MIAL underpass on Justice MC Chhagla Road is 48 metres long.
