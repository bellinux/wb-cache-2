5|$|A few sheep {{conditions}} are transmissible to humans. Orf (also known as scabby mouth, contagious ecthyma or soremouth) is a skin disease leaving lesions that is transmitted through skin-to-skin contact. Cutaneous anthrax is also called woolsorter's disease, as the spores {{can be transmitted}} in unwashed wool. More seriously, the organisms that can cause spontaneous <b>enzootic</b> abortion in sheep are easily transmitted to pregnant women. Also of concern are the prion disease scrapie and {{the virus that causes}} foot-and-mouth disease (FMD), as both can devastate flocks. The latter poses a slight risk to humans. During the 2001 FMD pandemic in the UK, hundreds of sheep were culled and some rare British breeds were at risk of extinction due to this.|$|E
25|$|Since human plague {{is rare in}} {{most parts}} of the world, routine {{vaccination}} is not needed other than for those at particularly high risk of exposure, nor for people living in areas with <b>enzootic</b> plague, meaning it occurs at regular, predictable rates in populations and specific areas, such as the western United States. It is not even indicated for most travellers to countries with known recent reported cases, particularly if their travel is limited to urban areas with modern hotels. The CDC thus only recommends vaccination for: (1) all laboratory and field personnel who are working with Y. pestis organisms resistant to antimicrobials; (2) people engaged in aerosol experiments with Y. pestis; and (3) people engaged in field operations in areas with <b>enzootic</b> plague where preventing exposure is not possible (such as some disaster areas).|$|E
25|$|Except for {{one study}} in Europe, {{much of the}} data implicating lizards is based on DNA {{detection}} of the spirochete and has not demonstrated lizards are able to infect ticks feeding upon them. As some experiments suggest lizards are refractory to infection with Borrelia, it appears likely their involvement in the <b>enzootic</b> cycle is more complex and species-specific.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} {{reported}} cases of the disease has been increasing, as are endemic regions in North America. For example, B. burgdorferi sensu lato was previously thought to be hindered {{in its ability to}} be maintained in an <b>enzootic</b> cycle in California, because it was assumed the large lizard population would dilute the prevalence of B. burgdorferi in local tick populations; this has since been brought into question, as some evidence has suggested lizards can become infected.|$|E
25|$|SeV is {{responsible}} for a highly transmissible respiratory tract infection in mice, hamsters, guinea pigs, rats, and occasionally pigs, and marmosets with infection passing through both air and direct contact routes. The virus can be detected in mouse colonies worldwide, generally in suckling to young adult mice. Epizootic infections of mice are usually associated with a high mortality rate, while <b>enzootic</b> disease patterns suggest that the virus is latent and can be cleared {{over the course of}} a year. Sublethal exposure to SeV can promote long-lasting immunity to further lethal doses of SeV.|$|E
25|$|The Black Death, {{caused by}} Yersinia pestis, is <b>enzootic</b> (commonly present) in populations of ground rodents in Central Asia. Morelli et al. (2010) {{reported}} {{the origin of}} the plague bacillus to be in China. An older theory places the first cases in the steppes of Central Asia, and others, such as the historian Michael W. Dols, argue that the historical evidence concerning epidemics in the Mediterranean and specifically the Plague of Justinian point to a probability that the Black Death originated in Central Asia (not Africa - Asia (http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/206309.php) where it then became entrenched among the rodent population.|$|E
25|$|The {{government}} had already paid substantial compensation to farmers {{because of the}} foot and mouth outbreak in 2001 followed by the bluetongue outbreak in 2007, {{against the background of}} EC Directives 77/391 and 78/52 on eradication of tuberculosis, brucellosis or <b>enzootic</b> bovine leucosis. In the 2001 foot and mouth outbreak, a total of £1.4 billion in compensation was paid. The Cattle Compensation (England) Order 2006 (SI2006/168) was overturned when the High Court decided the Order was unlawful; in the test case, farmers had been receiving compensation payments of around £1,000 on animals valued at over £3,000, but in extreme cases the discrepancy between animal value and compensation paid was over one thousand percent. This case was itself overturned on appeal in 2009.|$|E
25|$|During the 20th century, F. magna was {{reported}} in these American states: Arkansas, California, Colorado, Illinois, Iowa, Kansas, Louisiana, Michigan, Minnesota, Montana, New York, Oklahoma, Oregon, South Carolina, Texas, Washington, and Wisconsin. Areas of New England are not areas normally inhabited by F. magna, but the fluke {{has been reported in}} this region. In Canada, the fluke {{was reported}} in Alberta, British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec. Currently, F. magna is <b>enzootic</b> in five major areas: (1) the Great Lakes region; (2) the Gulf coast, lower Mississippi, and southern Atlantic seaboard; (3) northern Pacific coast; (4) the Rocky Mountain trench; and (5) northern Quebec and Labrador. However, within these broad ranges, actual presence of giant liver flukes varies from locally abundant to locally absent.|$|E
25|$|In 1960’s, {{a number}} of F. magna {{outbreaks}} in cervids were reported {{in some areas of}} former Czechoslovakia. The prevalence of infection varied from 70 to 80% in red deer and maximum parasite burden was 144 worms. In addition, sudden deaths were documented in free or game ranging deer. The highest mortality was reported in free ranging roe deer in Písek County in the South Bohemia of former Czechoslovakia. In the same region, moreover, the parasite was found in livers of slaughtered cattle. Erhardová-Kotrlá (1971) confirmed red deer, fallow deer and roe deer as main definitive hosts of F. magna in Europe. In 1960’s, F. magna was <b>enzootic</b> in former Czechoslovakia in following four major areas: (1) České Budějovice and Třeboň county, including Nové Hrady Mountains; (2) the area along the Vltava River on the Vltava-Týn hills near Hluboká and Bechyně; (3) Písek and Milevsko county; (4) the Brdy mountains and the Hřebeny mountains. In following years, F. magna was only reported from these areas. Recently, geographical distribution of F. magna in cervids was determined in the Czech Republic. The giant liver fluke was confirmed in the same areas as reported in 1960’s. However, seven new endemic areas of F. magna were discovered suggesting that the parasite is spreading in the Czech Republic. Moreover, the appearance of F. magna in the Šumava Mountains has epizootiological importance due to possibility of spread of the parasite into the German territory (Bavaria). During the last few years, a new European <b>enzootic</b> area has established in the Danube watershed in Central Europe. In 1988, F. magna was isolated from a 3-year old red deer female found dead near the Gabčíkovo water plant at the Danube River in Slovakia. The parasite has spread through whole Slovakian Danube watershed.|$|E
25|$|The plague disease, {{caused by}} Yersinia pestis, is <b>enzootic</b> (commonly present) in populations of fleas carried by ground rodents, {{including}} marmots, in various areas including Central Asia, Kurdistan, Western Asia, Northern India and Uganda. Nestorian graves dating to 1338–1339 near Lake Issyk Kul in Kyrgyzstan have inscriptions referring to plague and are thought by many epidemiologists {{to mark the}} outbreak of the epidemic, from which it could easily have spread to China and India. In October 2010, medical geneticists suggested that all three of the great waves of the plague originated in China. In China, the 13th-century Mongol conquest caused a decline in farming and trading. However, economic recovery had been observed {{at the beginning of the}} 14thcentury. In the 1330s, a large number of natural disasters and plagues led to widespread famine, starting in 1331, with a deadly plague arriving soon after. Epidemics that may have included plague killed an estimated 25million Chinese and other Asians during the 15years before it reached Constantinople in 1347.|$|E
25|$|Natural infections of F. magna occur {{primarily}} in cervids and bovids. Although many species {{are susceptible to}} infection, only a few cervid species contribute significantly to maintaining populations of the fluke. In North America, the common definitive hosts of the giant liver fluke are wapiti (Cervus elaphus canadensis), white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) and caribou (Rangifer tarandus). In Europe, F. magna occurs commonly in red deer (Cervus elaphus), fallow deer (Dama dama) and roe deer (Capreolus capreolus). Domestic ruminants are also susceptible to natural infection with F. magna. However, the infection is not patent, and domestic ruminants do {{not contribute to the}} propagation of the parasite in the environment. In North America, the giant liver fluke is commonly found in cattle, sheep and goats in areas where F. magna is <b>enzootic</b> in deer. In contrast, F. magna occurs rarely in domestic ruminants in Europe. The list of all natural definitive hosts of F. magna is presented in Table. Humans are not known to be a definitive host.|$|E
2500|$|Different {{isolates}} (unique strains) of VHSV {{are typically}} grouped by genotyping. It is found that genotype groups are divided more geographically than by host species. Earlier studies used different numbering systems, but the following system {{has come into}} common usage based on genotype similarity based on sequencing of the N- and G-genes. Types I-III are <b>enzootic</b> to Europe, and Type IV to North America, and Type I and type IV isolates are further subdivided, as follows: ...|$|E
2500|$|Death from {{botulism}} {{is common}} in waterfowl; an estimated 10,000 to 100,000 birds die of botulism annually. The disease is commonly called [...] "limberneck". In some large outbreaks, a million or more birds may die. Ducks appear to be affected most often. An <b>enzootic</b> form of duck botulism in Western USA and Canada is known as [...] "western duck sickness". Botulism also affects commercially raised poultry. In chickens, the mortality rate varies from a few birds to 40% of the flock.|$|E
2500|$|The CDC {{lists the}} {{following}} areas as active foci of human epidemic typhus: Andean regions of South America, some parts of Africa; on the other hand, the CDC only recognizes an active <b>enzootic</b> cycle in the United States involving flying squirrels (CDC). Though epidemic typhus is commonly thought to be restricted to areas of the developing world, serological examination of homeless persons in Houston found evidence for exposure to the bacterial pathogens that cause epidemic typhus and murine typhus. [...] A study involving 930 homeless people in Marseilles, France found high rates of seroprevalence to R. prowazekii and a high prevalence of louse-borne infections in the homeless.|$|E
2500|$|Influenza A virus subtype H5N1, {{also known}} as A(H5N1) or simply H5N1, is a subtype of the {{influenza}} A virus which can cause illness in humans and many other animal species. A bird-adapted strain of H5N1, called HPAI A(H5N1) for highly pathogenic avian influenza virus of type A of subtype H5N1, is the highly pathogenic causative agent of H5N1 flu, commonly known as avian influenza ("bird flu"). It is <b>enzootic</b> (maintained in the population) in many bird populations, especially in Southeast Asia. One strain of HPAI A(H5N1) is spreading globally after first appearing in Asia. It is epizootic (an epidemic in nonhumans) and panzootic (affecting animals of many species, especially over a wide area), killing {{tens of millions of}} birds and spurring the culling of hundreds of millions of others to stem its spread. Many references to [...] "bird flu" [...] and H5N1 in the popular media refer to this strain. This was reprinted in 2005: ...|$|E
2500|$|Diagnosis is {{achieved}} most commonly by serologic {{testing of the}} blood {{for the presence of}} antibodies against the ehrlichia organism. Many veterinarians routinely test for the disease, especially in <b>enzootic</b> areas. During the acute phase of infection, the test can be falsely negative because the body will not have had time to make antibodies to the infection. As such, the test should be repeated. A PCR (polymerase chain reaction) test can be performed during this stage to detect genetic material of the bacteria. The PCR test is more likely to yield a negative result during the subclinical and chronic disease phases. [...] In addition, blood tests may show abnormalities in the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, and most commonly platelets, if the disease is present. Uncommonly, a diagnosis can be made by looking under a microscope at a blood smear for the presence of the ehrlichia morulae, which sometimes can be seen as intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies within a white blood cell.|$|E
2500|$|Contact with {{farm animals}} {{can lead to}} disease in farmers or others that {{come into contact with}} {{infected}} animals. [...] Glanders primarily affects those who work closely with horses and donkeys. Close contact with cattle can lead to cutaneous anthrax infection, whereas inhalation anthrax infection is more common for workers in slaughterhouses, tanneries and wool mills. Close contact with sheep who have recently given birth can lead to clamydiosis, or <b>enzootic</b> abortion, in pregnant women, as well as an increased risk of Q fever, toxoplasmosis, and listeriosis in pregnant or the otherwise immunocompromised. Echinococcosis is caused by a tapeworm which can be spread from infected sheep by food or water contaminated with feces or wool. Bird flu is common in chickens. While rare in humans, the main public health worry is that a strain of bird flu will recombine with a human flu virus and cause a pandemic like the 1918 Spanish flu. In 2017, free range chickens in the UK were temporarily ordered to remain inside due to the threat of bird flu. Cattle are an important reservoir of cryptosporidiosis and mainly affects the immunocompromised.|$|E
2500|$|Soon {{after the}} Slovakian first report, F. magna {{was found in}} red deer in Hungarian parts of Danubian {{floodplain}} forests. The prevalence reported by the same authors was up to 90%. F. magna infection of cervids is a considerable problem in northern part of Hungary (Szigetköz) and the southern Danubian territory in the Gemenc area. Since the autumn of 2000, F. magna {{has been found in}} Austrian territory, east of Vienna. In years 2000-2001, the prevalence of the giant liver fluke in red deer in Austrian parts of Danube (east of Vienna) was 66.7%. [...] Appearance of American liver fluke was reported in Croatia in January 2000. The prevalence of fascioloidosis among red deer in Hungary was 21,1-60,7% between 1998-2005. During the necropsy of 459 deer livers (using Egri's method) the number of flukes per host ranged from 1 to 138 in the same period. Regarding the origin of F. magna <b>enzootic</b> area in the Danube River watershed, it is essential to point out that cervids were not introduced into these localities, neither recently nor in the past. Origin of the F. magna population in Danubian floodplain forests in Central Europe remains therefore unclear.|$|E
