5|$|Emma asks Mr. Gold (Robert Carlyle) {{about the}} compass and he {{searches}} his records. He finds {{a card that}} supposedly says Michael Tillman purchased the compass, and gives Emma this name. The card is revealed to be blank. Michael is the garage mechanic, and tells Emma <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> handle the garage let alone twins. Emma {{has no choice but}} to take Ava and Nicholas to Boston on Regina's orders, despite Henry's warnings that no one can leave Storybrooke. That evening as the three are leaving, the vehicle breaks down as they reach the city limits, prompting Emma to call for help. Moments later, Ava notices her compass working. Michael arrives in his tow truck, and Emma explains that he at least has to see his children, as she could not leave Henry after seeing the life he had. Seeing Ava and Nicholas face to face changes his mind, and Michael accepts them into his life. Later, Emma shares Henry's theory with Mary Margaret (Ginnifer Goodwin), that she is Snow White's daughter and Mary Margaret is Snow White. Mary finds this laughable, but seeing Emma's blanket triggers some sort of reaction from her. After a minute, however, she is quick to dismiss it as nothing.|$|E
25|$|King's addictions {{to alcohol}} and other drugs were so serious during the 1980s that, as he {{acknowledged}} in On Writing in 2000, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> remember writing Cujo. Shortly after the novel's publication, King's family and friends staged an intervention, dumping on the rug {{in front of him}} evidence of his addictions taken from his office including beer cans, cigarette butts, grams of cocaine, Xanax, Valium, NyQuil, dextromethorphan (cough medicine) and marijuana. As King related in his memoir, he then sought help, quit all drugs (including alcohol) in the late 1980s, and has remained sober since. The first novel he wrote after becoming sober was Needful Things.|$|E
500|$|April {{begins with}} another social disaster. The Pooters receive an {{invitation}} to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be [...] shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.|$|E

50|$|In {{the present}} timeline, Rohit Mehta (Jisshu Sengupta), a Gujarati born {{and brought up}} in Calcutta, {{falls in love with}} Mahamaya (Swastika Mukherjee) and tries to woo her. Since <b>he</b> <b>can</b> just <b>barely</b> utter a few Bengali words (and that too in the wrong places), Mahamaya throws him a hurdle to cross - if <b>he</b> <b>can</b> write a song with correct Bengali lyrics and sing it without any accent or mistake, she would think of a {{possible}} relationship. Rohit accepts the challenge and goes to Portugal to study colonial history.|$|R
500|$|Conversely, Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle {{criticized the}} story, pacing, and Phoenix's character. He also opined {{that the film}} was [...] "a lot more {{interesting}} to think about than watch". J. R. Jones of the Chicago Reader gave the film 2 out of 4 stars, praising the performances of Phoenix and Johansson, but also criticizing Phoenix's character, calling him an [...] "idiot". He also criticized the lack of realism {{in the relationship between}} Phoenix and Johansson's characters. Stephanie Zacharek of The Village Voice opined that Jonze was [...] "so entranced with his central conceit that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> move beyond it", and criticized the dialogue as being [...] "premeditated." [...] However, she also praised Johannson's performance, calling it [...] "the movie's saving grace" [...] and stating that Her [...] "isn't just unimaginable without Johansson—it might have been unbearable without her".|$|E
500|$|As directors, Minkoff and Allers [...] "work {{very closely}} with the actors to create their performance." [...] Describing Irons as [...] "a gentleman and a {{brilliant}} actor," [...] Allers revealed that the actor was constantly offering [...] "extra interpretations of lines which were fantastic." [...] Producer Don Hahn recalled that Irons [...] "really wanted {{to play with the}} words and the pacing," [...] specifically referring to a scene in which Scar, voiced by Jeremy Irons, coaxes Simba onto a rock and tricks the young cub to stay there and await his father's arrival alone, dubbing it [...] "a father and son... thing." [...] According to Hahn, [...] "The comedy in [...] inflection comes from Scar sounding so disdainful <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> summon the will to finish the sentence." [...] Irons' physical appearance and mannerisms served as inspiration for Scar's supervising animator Andreas Deja, namely his flicking his paw in disgust. Critics have cited physical similarities between Irons and Scar.|$|E
500|$|In his memoir, Eminent Hipsters, Fagen {{notes that}} the cover figure [...] "wasn't {{supposed}} to be a stand-in for any particular jazz DJ," [...] but noted a few personalities from the period that factored into the creation: Ed Beach, Dan Morgenstern, Martin Williams, R.D. Harlan, [...] "Symphony Sid" [...] Torin, and what Fagen regarded as his [...] "main man", WEVD's Mort Fega. [...] "He was laid-back, knowledgeable, and forthright, the cool uncle you wished you'd had." [...] At the time of the album's release, he remembered that jazz music offered him an escape from the adults in his life: [...] "When I saw E.T.,' I realized that the E.T. in my bedroom was my Thelonious Monk records. Everything that he represented was totally unworldly in a way, although at the same time jazz to me seemed more real than the environment in which I was living." [...] The Wall Street Journal Robert J. Toth writes, [...] "The cover adds another layer of autobiography. On the front, we see Mr. Fagen as a crew-cut deejay on the graveyard shift. On the back is his audience, a single lighted window in a row of tract homes — or maybe the artist as a young man, drinking in inspiration." [...] Robert Palmer, of The New York Times, continued in this line of thinking: [...] "Inside, there's a teenager with his ear next to a portable radio. He's playing it softly, so his parents won't wake up, and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> make out the sounds through the static. [...] The teenager was Donald Fagen." ...|$|E

50|$|Low-Light {{is shown}} in a few scenes of G.I. Joe: The Movie, but {{like many of the}} {{characters}} of the Sunbow Cartoon, he has a very minor role. His most memorable part was serving as bailiff during Falcon's Court-martial. He is glimpsed at the battle of the Statue of Liberty in the opening, and can be glimpsed during the battle of Cobra-La. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> be seen <b>barely</b> getting up from the ground after the explosive destruction of Cobra-La, as Doc calls Hawk regarding Duke's recovery.|$|R

Later, his father Martin, a retired Seattle Police Department detective who {{was shot in the}} line of duty, ends up moving in with him. [...] Frasier becomes concerned about his father in his current state as <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> walk, and requires a cane to move. In Cheers, Frasier says that his father is dead, and that he was a scientist. He also says that he is an only child. This inconsistency is later explained in [...] "The Show Where Sam Shows Up": At Frasier's apartment, Sam Malone tells Martin and Niles what Frasier had said about them, and Frasier explains {{that he was trying to}} distance himself from his family at the time. In Cheers, Frasier tells bar patrons that he is an orphan. He confirms in [...] "To All the Girls I've Loved Before" [...] (1988) that his mother Hester, portrayed by Nancy Marchand in [...] "Diane Meets Mom" [...] (1984) and then by Rita Wilson in flashbacks in [...] "Mamma Mia" [...] (1999) and [...] "Don Juan in Hell: Part 2" [...] (2001), is dead off-screen.|$|E

5000|$|In The Thinking Engine by James Lovegrove, set in 1895- {{specifically}} {{at the same}} time as the events of [...] "The Adventure of the Three Students"- Holmes is called to challenge the Thinking Engine, an early computer that is seemingly capable of solving crimes using the same deductive abilities as Holmes himself. As the novel unfolds, Holmes realizes that every case the Engine has been called on to solve was committed by a perpetrator who had to be assisted by someone else to come up with such an intellectual scheme. In the final confrontation, Holmes and his allies realize that the Thinking Engine is actually a hollow construct with Moriarty inside it; he survived the confrontation at the Reichenbach Falls as he was wearing a specially-designed body armour that protected his vital organs, although his limbs were so injured that his legs and one arm have been amputated and <b>he</b> <b>can</b> still <b>barely</b> speak on his own. With his deception exposed, Moriarty apparently dies due to complications of the drugs being used to medicate his injuries, although it is strongly implied that Holmes gave him a deliberate overdose to prevent the risk of a trial allowing Moriarty to escape again.|$|R

60|$|The {{master of}} hounds best known by modern {{description}} {{is the master}} of the Jorrocks type. Now, as I take it, this is not the type best known by English sportsmen, nor do the Jorrocks ana, good though they be, give any fair picture of such a master of hounds as ordinarily presides over the hunt in English counties. Mr. Jorrocks comes into a hunt when no one else can be found to undertake the work; when, in want of any one better, the subscribers hire his services as those of an upper servant; when, in fact, the hunt is at a low ebb, and is struggling for existence. Mr. Jorrocks with his carpet-bag then makes his appearance, driving the hardest bargain that he can, purposing to do the country at the lowest possible figure, followed by a short train of most undesirable nags, with reference to which the wonder is that Mr. Jorrocks should be able to induce any hunting servant to trust his neck to their custody. Mr. Jorrocks knows his work, and is generally a most laborious man. Hunting is his profession, but it is one by which <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> exist. He hopes to sell a horse or two during the season, and in this way adds something of the trade of a dealer to his other trade. But his office is thankless, ill-paid, closely watched, and subject to all manner of indignities. Men suspect him, and the best of those who ride with him will hardly treat him as their equal. He is accepted as a disagreeable necessity, and is dismissed as soon as the country can do better for itself. Any hunt that has subjected itself to Mr. Jorrocks knows that it is in disgrace, and will pass its itinerant master on to some other district as soon as it can suit itself with a proper master of the good old English sort.|$|E
60|$|There is, perhaps, no {{condition}} of mind {{more difficult for}} the ordinarily well-instructed inhabitant of a city to realise than that of such a girl as Ruby Ruggles. The rural day labourer and his wife live on a level surface which is comparatively open to the eye. Their aspirations, whether for good or evil,--whether for food and drink to be honestly earned for themselves and children, or for drink first, to be come by either honestly or dishonestly,--are, if looked at at all, fairly visible. And with the men of the Ruggles class one can generally find out what they would be at, and in what direction their minds are at work. But the Ruggles woman,--especially the Ruggles young woman,--is better educated, has higher aspirations and a brighter imagination, and is infinitely more cunning than the man. If she be good-looking and relieved from the pressure of want, her thoughts soar into a world which is as unknown to her as heaven is to us, and in regard to which her longings are apt to be infinitely stronger than are ours for heaven. Her education has been much better than that of the man. She can read, whereas he can only spell words from a book. She can write a letter after her fashion, whereas <b>he</b> <b>can</b> <b>barely</b> spell words out on a paper. Her tongue is more glib, and her intellect sharper. But her ignorance as to the reality of things is much more gross than his. By such contact as he has with men in markets, in the streets of the towns he frequents, and even in the fields, he learns something unconsciously of the relative {{condition of}} his countrymen,--and, as to that which he does not learn, his imagination is obtuse. But the woman builds castles in the air, and wonders, and longs. To the young farmer the squire's daughter is a superior being very much out of his way. To the farmer's daughter the young squire is an Apollo, whom to look at is a pleasure,--by whom to be looked at is a delight. The danger for the most part is soon over. The girl marries after her kind, and then husband and children put the matter at rest for ever.|$|E
