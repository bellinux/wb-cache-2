5|$|H2 is {{a product}} of some types of {{anaerobic}} metabolism and is produced by several microorganisms, usually via reactions catalyzed by iron- or nickel-containing enzymes called hydrogenases. These enzymes catalyze the reversible redox reaction between H2 and its component two protons and two electrons. Creation of hydrogen gas occurs in the transfer of reducing equivalents produced during pyruvate fermentation to water. The natural cycle of <b>hydrogen</b> <b>production</b> and consumption by organisms is called the hydrogen cycle.|$|E

Zinc oxide is used to protect rubber polymers and plastics from ultraviolet radiation (UV). The semiconductor properties of zinc oxide make it useful in varistors and photocopying products.

5|$|The {{demolition}} {{contract for}} the station was won by London-based company Brown & Mason. Before the demolition of the stations' main structures, it was required that they be decommissioned. This involved the removal of hazardous materials and contaminants, to keep in line with Health & Safety at Work regulations. Oils and chemicals were removed for re-use or disposal and storage tanks were flushed out. Methanol was removed from <b>hydrogen</b> <b>production</b> plants on site, along with bottled propane used for welding. The remaining coal in the coal storage area was dispatched to operating power stations {{in other parts of}} the country. The landfill site where ash waste from the station was dumped was topsoiled.

40|$|Abstract—Oxygen free radicals, {{including}} hydrogen peroxide, may mediate {{oxidative stress}} in target organ tissues {{and contribute to}} cardiovascular complications in hypertension. To examine heritability of <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production,</b> we investigated this trait in a family-based cohort consisting of family members (n� 236) ascertained through probands (n� 57) with essential hypertension. Significant effects on <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> were found for gender and ethnicity, with men having greater values than women (P� 0. 001) and white subjects having greater values than black subjects (P� 0. 025). <b>Hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> correlated directly with plasma renin activity (P� 0. 015), suggesting an important interaction between circulating oxygen radicals and the renin-angiotensin system and a potential mechanism for lower hydrogen peroxide values observed in blacks. Heritability estimates from familial correlations revealed that approximately 20 % to 35 % of the observed variance in <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> {{could be attributed to}} genetic factors, suggesting a substantial heritable component to the overall determination of this trait. <b>Hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> negatively correlated with cardiac contractility (r�� 0. 214, P� 0. 001) and renal function (r�� 0. 194, P� 0. 003). In conclusion, these results indicate that <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> is heritable and is related to target organ function in essential hypertension. Genetic loci influencing <b>hydrogen</b> peroxide <b>production</b> may represent logical candidates to investigate as susceptibility genes for cardiovascular target organ injury.

5|$|Solar {{chemical}} processes use solar energy to drive chemical reactions. These processes offset energy {{that would otherwise}} come from a fossil fuel source and can also convert solar energy into storable and transportable fuels. Solar induced chemical reactions {{can be divided into}} thermochemical or photochemical. A variety of fuels can be produced by artificial photosynthesis. The multielectron catalytic chemistry involved in making carbon-based fuels (such as methanol) from reduction of carbon dioxide is challenging; a feasible alternative is <b>hydrogen</b> <b>production</b> from protons, though use of water as the source of electrons (as plants do) requires mastering the multielectron oxidation of two water molecules to molecular oxygen. Some have envisaged working solar fuel plants in coastal metropolitan areas by 2050 the splitting of sea water providing hydrogen to be run through adjacent fuel-cell electric power plants and the pure water by-product going directly into the municipal water system. Another vision involves all human structures covering the earth's surface (i.e., roads, vehicles and buildings) doing photosynthesis more efficiently than plants.|$|E
