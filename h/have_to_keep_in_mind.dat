50|$|Rotationally molded parts have {{to follow}} some {{restrictions}} that are different from other plastic processes. As it is a low pressure process, sometimes designers face hard to reach areas in the mold. Good quality powder may help overcome some situations, but usually the designers <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> {{that it is not}} possible to make sharp threads that would be possible with injection molding. Some products based on polyethylene can be put in the mold before filling it with the main material. This can help to avoid holes that otherwise would appear in some areas. This could also be achieved using molds with movable sections.|$|E

In the first half, there is romance and suddenly a rape scene, so I had to add a lot of grays to give that effect. And, the climax was the most challenging part, as it’s very dramatic and I had to add the proper effect to retain the mood. Here, the subject was a little dark so I could experiment, but in normal movies you can’t do much of an experiment.

He suggested that [...] "we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> the awesome pace of change and realise how little time is left to act, and then each community and nation must find the best use of the resources they have to sustain civilisation {{for as long as they}} can".|$|E

Music video for the song is very similar to Work bitch by Britney Spears. In interview for Britney.rs, Nikolija said that she is glad that she inspired her American colleague. “You <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that today is 2013. year and it is too hard to be 100% original.

5000|$|A modern conception, {{there is}} no {{mentioning}} of a [...] "heavy cavalry" [...] in the Greek military manuals. Unfortunately, even today, we don't have a concrete notion of what [...] "heavy cavalry" [...] should be. According to one school of thought, it is any cavalry capable of shock action against the enemy line, according to another, it should just be heavily armored. According to the Greeks, we have to define it as any cavalry that was not considered [...] "light", that is, which was not purely skirmishing. Another aspect of the cavalry of the ancient era we <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> is the unwillingness to use even the best trained and heaviest of cavalries against any dense mass of able infantry. This is evident in many ancient descriptions of battles. According to Arrian, when Alexander faced the Indian tribe of the Malli, he did not dare assault them with his, by now, veteran Heteroi or Thessalians, but he followed the customary cavalry tactics of attacks and retreats (perispasmoi).|$|E

Everyone uses this expression as he chooses. When the government feels sad for the killing of 3,000 people who were killed on September 11, we also should feel sorry that the American government who is represented by General Martins and others who have killed thousands of people. Millions. This definition is a resilient definition. Every dictator can put on this definition as the shoes that he uses to step on every person in this world, every law and every constitution. Many can kill people under the name of national security, and to torture people under the name of national security, and detain their children under the name of national security. I don't want to be long but I can say that the president can take someone and throw him in the sea in the name of national security. And so well he can also legislate the killings, assassinations, under the name of national security, for American citizens. My only advice to you that you do not get affected by the crocodile tears. Because your blood is not made of gold and ours made of water. We are all human beings. Thank you." ...|$|E

I think that Robin Thicke is doing really amazing things with his music videos right now, but you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>keep</b> <b>in</b> <b>mind</b> that this is just the lyric video so it's actually the video before the video. I thought that it was really cool that people are putting out lyric videos and when I started to think about what I wanted to do for this one, I researched a bunch of recent lyrical videos and I wanted it to be a production. I wanted to come out in a big way. So I had this idea that, since there's so much hype and talk about the song being all about these girls and how I'm allegedly calling out all these exes, I thought [...] "Why don’t we get these girls and project the lyrics onto their bodies?" [...] That’s sort of where it started and we turned them into human canvases. I really like the way it came out. I definitely wanted to do something different and really showcase what I like artistically right now.|$|E
