40|$|In metal-forming industries, die is an {{important}} tool for fabrication of metal-formed products. Die service life, which {{is defined as the}} maximum product number produced by die before it fails, and die performance directly determine the quality of metal-formed product and production cost. In cold forming process, die service life basically refers to the die fatigue life. The die fatigue life is determined by the design of metal-formed product and die, forming process configuration, <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> and the entire metal-forming system. In this paper, a methodology for optimization of die fatigue life is developed via the rational design of metal-forming system {{in such a way that}} the <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> is optimal and further the die design in terms of its service life is the best. To realize this thought, the S-N approach is employed for evaluation of die fatigue life. The <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> is first identified via the integrated simulation of billet plastic flow and the die deformation during the forming process. The <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> is then optimized via the rational design of the combination of metal-formed product, die and process configuration. The optimal die life is thus determined. Furthermore, a framework for implementation of this methodology is developed and case studies are used for verification and validation of the developed methodology.

The materials of die and crankshaft workpiece are H 13 steel and L 1438 steel, respectively. The material flow in the die, contact pressure distribution and temperature distribution of the die were investigated. The interaction forces between the workpiece and the dies were mapped onto die faces to serve as load boundary conditions for <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> analysis. The results showed that the <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> reduces with increasing temperature and increases with increasing strain rate. Such behavior is likely associated with flow stress of the workpiece, which reduces with increasing temperature and increases with increasing strain rate.

40|$|In {{die design}} process, {{the design and}} {{prediction}} of die fatigue life is a non-trivial issue. Many factors in die life cycle from design, fabrication to service all affect die life. The die life in cold forging processes is basically determined by die fatigue failure. The design and assessment of die fatigue life needs to consider all the affecting factors including die structure and component design, materials selection and properties configuration, die fabrication and service conditions. Currently, there is no efficient approach to providing complete solutions by considering all of these factors. CAE simulation technology, however, presents a promising approach to addressing the issue. In this paper, a simulation-based approach for die life design and assessment is presented. The approach employs both stress-life and strain-life fatigue analysis methods to conduct the die fatigue life design and analysis based on the stress and strain revealed by CAE simulation. As the <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> and strain in forming process vary dynamically, the integrated simulation of forming process and die deformation is conducted {{in such a way}} that the dynamic <b>die</b> <b>stress</b> and strain can be identified and determined. To implement this idea, a realization framework is orchestrated and the processes and procedure under the framework are succinctly articulated. The implementation with case studies is finally used to test and verify the validity, robustness, and efficiency of the developed approach. The approach is proven to be able to provide satisfactory solutions for die life design and assessment in the early stage of die design. Department of Mechanical Engineerin...|$|E
