5|$|Cetaceans and {{artiodactyls}} now {{are classified}} under the order Cetartiodactyla, often still {{referred to as}} Artiodactyla, which includes both whales and <b>hippopotamuses.</b> The hippopotamus and pygmy hippopotamus are the whale's closest terrestrial living relatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} is {{the type}} genus of the family Hippopotamidae. The pygmy hippopotamus belongs to a different genus in Hippopotamidae, either Choeropsis or Hexaprotodon. Hippopotamidae are sometimes known as hippopotamids. Sometimes, the subfamily Hippopotaminae is used. Further, some taxonomists group <b>hippopotamuses</b> and anthracotheres in the superfamily Anthracotheroidea. Hippopotamidae are classified along with other even-toed ungulates in the order Artiodactyla. Other artiodactyls include camels, cattle, deer and pigs, although <b>hippopotamuses</b> are not closely related to these groups.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hippopotamuses</b> {{appear to}} {{communicate}} vocally, through grunts and bellows, {{and they may}} practice echolocation, but {{the purpose of these}} vocalizations is currently unknown. Hippos have the unique ability to hold their heads partially above the water and send out a cry that travels through both water and air; individuals respond above and under water. Hippos will also express threat and alarm with exhalations.|$|E
5|$|Elephants, lions, buffalo, <b>hippopotamuses,</b> rhinoceroses, giraffes, antelopes, leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, {{and many}} species of snakes are found here, {{although}} most large carnivore populations have been drastically reduced since the early 20th century. Elephant poaching, particularly {{in the south of}} the country in areas such as Zakouma National Park, is a severe problem. The small group of surviving West African crocodiles in the Ennedi Plateau represents one of the last colonies known in the Sahara today.|$|E
5|$|Hypogeomys australis {{is one of}} {{only three}} extinct rodents known from Madagascar (the others are Brachytarsomys mahajambaensis and Nesomys narindaensis from northwestern Madagascar). In general, few small animals became extinct on Madagascar, except for these rodents, two species of Plesiorycteropus, and the shrew tenrec Microgale macpheei; in contrast, large animals such as subfossil lemurs, the {{carnivore}} Cryptoprocta spelea, Malagasy <b>hippopotamuses,</b> Dipsochelys tortoises, and Aepyornis and Mullerornis birds all became extinct around the time that humans arrived.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014, RatPac Entertainment and Class 5 Films {{acquired}} the non-fiction article American Hippopotamus, by Jon Mooallem, about the meat shortage in the U.S. in 1910 and the attempts made by Burnham, Duquesne and Congressman Robert Broussard to import <b>hippopotamuses</b> into the Louisiana bayous and to convince Americans to eat them. The movie will highlight the Burnham - Duquesne rivalry. Edward Norton, William Migliore and Brett Ratner will produce this feature film.|$|E
5|$|One branch would {{evolve into}} cetaceans, {{possibly}} beginning about , with the protowhale Pakicetus and other early whale ancestors collectively known as Archaeoceti, which eventually underwent aquatic adaptation into the completely aquatic cetaceans. The other branch became the anthracotheres, {{a large family}} of four-legged beasts, the earliest of which in the late Eocene would have resembled skinny <b>hippopotamuses</b> with comparatively small and narrow heads. All branches of the anthracotheres, except that which evolved into Hippopotamidae, became extinct during the Pliocene without leaving any descendants.|$|E
5|$|River {{dolphins}} {{are a very}} widespread {{group of}} fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water. They are an informal grouping of dolphins, which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea. The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae (the Indian dolphins), Iniidae (the Amazonian dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins). There are five extant species of river dolphins, and two subspecies. River dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla, with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives the <b>hippopotamuses,</b> having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippopotamus}} {{is considered}} to be very aggressive and has frequently been reported as charging and attacking boats. Small boats can be capsized by hippos and passengers can be injured or killed by the animals or drown. In one case in Niger, a boat was capsized by a hippo and 13 people were killed. As <b>hippopotamuses</b> will often engage in raiding nearby crops if the opportunity arises, humans may also come in conflict with them on these occasions, with potential for fatalities on both sides.|$|E
5|$|A {{biological}} pesticide {{to control}} locusts was tested across Africa by a multinational team in 1997. Dried fungal spores of a Metarhizium acridum sprayed in breeding areas pierce the locust exoskeleton on germination and invade the body cavity, causing death. The fungus is passed from insect to insect and persists in the area, making repeated treatments unnecessary. This approach to locust control {{was used in}} Tanzania in 2009 to treat around 10,000 hectares in the Iku-Katavi National Park infested with adult locusts. The outbreak was contained and the elephants, <b>hippopotamuses,</b> and giraffes present in the area were unharmed.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hippopotamuses</b> {{have been}} the {{subjects}} of various African folktales. According to a San story; when the Creator assigned each animal its place in nature, the hippos {{wanted to live in}} the water, but were refused out of fear that they might eat all the fish. After begging and pleading, the hippos were finally allowed to live in the water on the conditions that they would eat grass instead of fish and would fling their dung {{so that it can be}} inspected for fish bones. In a Ndebele tale, the hippo originally had long, beautiful hair, but was set on fire by a jealous hare and had to jump into a nearby pool. The hippo lost most of his hair and was too embarrassed to leave the water.|$|E
5|$|Porpoises are a {{group of}} fully aquatic marine mammals that are {{sometimes}} referred to as mereswine, all of which are classified under the family Phocoenidae, parvorder Odontoceti (toothed whales). There are six extant species of porpoise. They are small toothed whales that are very closely related to oceanic dolphins. The most obvious visible {{difference between the two groups}} is that porpoises have shorter beaks and flattened, spade-shaped teeth distinct from the conical teeth of dolphins. Porpoises, and other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates, and their closest living relatives are the <b>hippopotamuses,</b> having diverged from them about 40 million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The common {{hippopotamus}} inhabits rivers, lakes and mangrove swamps, where territorial bulls preside over {{a stretch of}} river and groups of five to thirty females and young. During the day, they remain cool by staying in the water or mud; reproduction and childbirth both occur in water. They emerge at dusk to graze on grasses. While <b>hippopotamuses</b> rest near {{each other in the}} water, grazing is a solitary activity and hippos are not territorial on land. The hippopotamus is a highly aggressive and unpredictable animal and has attacked humans. They are threatened by habitat loss and poaching for their meat and ivory canine teeth.|$|E
5|$|Whales are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} fully aquatic placental marine mammals. They are an informal grouping within the infraorder Cetacea, usually excluding dolphins and porpoises. Whales, dolphins and porpoises belong to the order Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates and their closest living relatives are the <b>hippopotamuses,</b> having diverged about 40 million years ago. The two parvorders of whales, baleen whales (Mysticeti) and toothed whales (Odontoceti), {{are thought to have}} split apart around 34 million years ago. The whales comprise eight extant families: Balaenopteridae (the rorquals), Balaenidae (right whales), Cetotheriidae (the pygmy right whale), Eschrichtiidae (the grey whale), Monodontidae (belugas and narwhals), Physeteridae (the sperm whale), Kogiidae (the dwarf and pygmy sperm whale), and Ziphiidae (the beaked whales).|$|E
5|$|Cryptoprocta spelea is {{the only}} extinct carnivoran mammal known from Madagascar; {{recently}} extinct Madagascan animals also include at least 17species of lemurs, {{most of which are}} larger than the living forms, as well as elephant birds and Malagasy <b>hippopotamuses,</b> among others. Subfossil remains of the giant fossa have been found in Holocene cave sites from the northern end of Madagascar along the west coast to the far south, and in the central highlands. Some sites have yielded both C.spelea and smaller remains referable to the living species, C.ferox; however, lack of robust stratigraphic knowledge and no available radiocarbon dating on subfossil Cryptoprocta bones makes it uncertain whether the two species lived in the same region at the same time. The size ratio between the two species is within the range of ratios seen between similar-sized living cats and mongooses found in the same areas, suggesting that the two species may have been able to occur together.|$|E
5|$|Female hippos reach sexual {{maturity}} at {{five to six}} years and have a gestation period of eight months. A study of endocrine systems revealed that female <b>hippopotamuses</b> may begin puberty as early as three or four years. Males reach maturity at around 7.5 yr. A study of hippopotamus reproductive behaviour in Uganda showed that peak conceptions occurred during {{the end of the}} wet season in the summer, and peak births occurred toward the beginning of the wet season in late winter. This is because of the female's oestrous cycle; as with most large mammals, male hippopotamus spermatozoa is active year-round. Studies of hippos in Zambia and South Africa also showed evidence of births occurring {{at the start of the}} wet season. After becoming pregnant, a female hippopotamus will typically not begin ovulation again for 17 months.|$|E
5|$|Lions {{are part}} of a group of exotic animals that are the core of zoo {{exhibits}} since the late eighteenth century; members of this group are invariably large vertebrates and include elephants, rhinoceroses, <b>hippopotamuses,</b> large primates, and other big cats; zoos sought to gather as many of these species as possible. Although many modern zoos are more selective about their exhibits, there are more than 1,000 African and 100 Asiatic lions in zoos and wildlife parks around the world. They are considered an ambassador species and are kept for tourism, education and conservation purposes. Lions can reach an age of over 20 years in captivity; Apollo, a resident lion of Honolulu Zoo in Honolulu, Hawaii, died at age 22 in August 2007. His two sisters, born in 1986, were still alive in August 2007. Breeding programs need to note origins to avoid breeding different subspecies and thus reducing conservation value. However, several Asiatic-African lion crosses have been bred.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{extinction}} of Plesiorycteropus, but MacPhee assumed it may have happened around 1000 years ago, when the extinction {{of the rest of the}} subfossil fauna of Madagascar is thought to have concluded. Nothing like it was reported by 17th-century European explorers of the island, and one bone has been radiocarbon dated to around 2150 Before Present (200 BCE). Its extinction is somewhat anomalous, as other recently extinct Madagascan animals—such as subfossil lemurs, Malagasy <b>hippopotamuses,</b> the giant fossa, and elephant birds—were generally larger and not exclusively insectivorous; also, some species with likely more specialized diets, such as the falanouc (Eupleres goudoti) and aye-aye (Daubentonia madagascariensis), did survive. Early human colonists of Madagascar may have caused the extinction of Plesiorycteropus through the destruction of the forest and other disturbances.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{maternal}} care they receive, hatchlings commonly fall to predation. While the female is transporting some {{to the nursery}} area, others are picked off by predators that lurk near the nest. The hatchlings {{are a source of}} food for most of the creatures that feed on eggs, and are also subject to aquatic attacks by turtles, fish, and snakes. Birds of prey take their toll, and in any clutch there may be malformed individuals that are unlikely to survive. In northern Australia, the survival rate for saltwater crocodile hatchlings is only twenty-five percent, but with each succeeding year of life this improves, reaching sixty percent by year five. Mortality rates are fairly low among subadults and adults, though they are occasionally preyed on by large cats and snakes. The jaguar and the giant otter may prey on caimans in South America. In other parts of the world, elephants and <b>hippopotamuses</b> may kill crocodiles defensively. Authorities differ as to whether much cannibalism takes place among crocodilians. Adults do not normally eat their own offspring, but there is some evidence of subadults feeding on juveniles and of adults attacking subadults. In Nile crocodiles, rival males sometimes kill each other during the breeding season.|$|E
25|$|In August or September 1966, Yvan Ridel took {{a picture}} of a large {{footprint}} with three toes, north-east of Loubomo, notable as <b>hippopotamuses</b> have four toes.|$|E
25|$|Jansson is principally {{known as}} the author of the Moomin books. Jansson created the Moomins, a family of trolls who are white, round and smooth in appearance, with large snouts that make them vaguely {{resemble}} <b>hippopotamuses.</b>|$|E
25|$|Zoo Basel {{started its}} {{breeding}} program for pygmy <b>hippopotamuses</b> in 1928, which {{has resulted in}} 53 hippo births. These animals and their offspring are living all over the globe. The zoo manages the international studbook for this species.|$|E
25|$|The {{adjective}} {{applying to}} cattle {{in general is}} usually bovine. The terms bull, cow and calf are also used by extension to denote the sex or age of other large animals, including whales, <b>hippopotamuses,</b> camels, elk and elephants.|$|E
25|$|The zoo had {{the first}} Indian {{rhinoceros}} birth in a zoo, {{as well as the}} first greater flamingo hatch. It has had repeated breeding success with animals including cheetahs (18 births), okapi (22), pygmy <b>hippopotamuses</b> (53), and flamingos (over 400 hatches). Every Somali wild ass (a donkey) in zoos worldwide is related to the population in Basel, where this species' zoological breeding program was started.|$|E
25|$|After {{becoming}} wealthy, Escobar created or bought numerous residences {{and safe}} houses, with the Hacienda Nápoles gaining significant notoriety. The luxury house contained a colonial house, a sculpture park, {{and a complete}} zoo with animals from various continents, including elephants, exotic birds, giraffes, and <b>hippopotamuses.</b> Escobar had also planned to construct a Greek-style citadel near it, and though construction of the citadel was started, it was never finished.|$|E
25|$|According to the Media Guardian, Fincham then {{confirmed}} that in autumn 2006, the 'Rhythm and Movement' idents {{would be replaced}} with a new presentation package, along with a new schedule. As speculated, Red Bee Media would create the new presentation package. Red Bee created the new idents for the ITV channels that were introduced in January 2006. On 26 September the BBC {{confirmed that}} from 7 October 2006, the 'Rhythm and Movement' idents would {{be replaced by a}} new Circle ident collection, including kites, surfers and <b>hippopotamuses.</b>|$|E
25|$|At {{one time}} Egypt had a cooler, wetter climate {{than it has}} today; ancient tomb {{paintings}} show giraffes, <b>hippopotamuses,</b> crocodiles and ostriches, and the petroglyphs at Silwa Bahari on the upper Nile, between Luxor and Aswan, show elephants, white rhinoceroses, gerenuk and more ostriches, a fauna akin to that of present-day East Africa. Nor does the country have many endemic species, these being limited to the Egyptian weasel, pallid gerbil, Mackilligin's gerbil (this may possibly extend into the Sudan), Flower's shrew, Nile Delta toad, and two butterflies, the Sinai baton blue and Satyrium jebelia.|$|E
25|$|Dolphins are {{a widely}} {{distributed}} and {{diverse group of}} aquatic mammals. They are an informal grouping within the order Cetacea, excluding whales and porpoises, so to zoologists the grouping is paraphyletic. The dolphins comprise the extant families Delphinidae (the oceanic dolphins), Platanistidae (the Indian river dolphins), Iniidae (the new world river dolphins), and Pontoporiidae (the brackish dolphins), and the extinct Lipotidae (baiji or Chinese river dolphin). There are 40 extant species of dolphins. Dolphins, alongside other cetaceans, belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla with even-toed ungulates. Cetaceans' closest living relatives are the <b>hippopotamuses,</b> having diverged about 40 million years ago.|$|E
25|$|The District of Nyagatare {{contains}} half of Akagera National Park {{where is}} found {{a vast number}} of wildlife including African buffalo, antelopes and more other ruminants. Because the park is not fenced, animals can come out to cause some damages in the neighboring human inhabited areas. The River Umuvumba, contains <b>hippopotamuses,</b> and Nile crocodiles. During flooding, these animals can get close to populated areas with dangerous consequences. The district also accommodates a huge variety of birds such as birds of prey, guineafowl, partridges, herons etc. Hares, wild boar, monkeys and other rodents are occasionally found in the wooded savanna.|$|E
25|$|The Nile is the {{lifeline}} of Egypt, {{the land}} bordering the river being rendered fertile by the irrigation it receives. Crops {{grown in the}} Nile Valley include cotton, cereals, sugarcane, beans, oil seed crops and groundnuts. Date palms grow here as well as sycamore, carob and Acacia. Fruit trees are planted here and eucalyptus has been introduced. The rich delta soil {{is used for the}} cultivation of grapes, vegetables and flowers. The papyrus reeds that used to line the river are now restricted to the far south of the country, as are the crocodiles and <b>hippopotamuses</b> that also used to be plentiful.|$|E
500|$|A 2010 study {{proposed}} that spinosaurids were semiaquatic, {{based on the}} oxygen isotope composition of spinosaurid teeth {{from around the world}} compared with that of other theropods and extant animals. Spinosaurids probably spent much of the day in water, like crocodiles and <b>hippopotamuses,</b> and had a diet similar to the former; both were opportunistic predators. Since most spinosaurids do not appear to have anatomical adaptations for an aquatic lifestyle, the authors {{proposed that}} submersion in water was a means of thermoregulation similar to that of crocodiles and <b>hippopotamuses.</b> Spinosaurids may also have turned to aquatic habitats and piscivory to avoid competition with large, more-terrestrial theropods.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hippopotamuses</b> have {{barrel-shaped}} {{bodies with}} short legs and long muzzles. Their skeletal structures are , adapted to carrying their enormous weight, and their specific gravity {{allows them to}} sink and move {{along the bottom of}} a river. <b>Hippopotamuses</b> have small legs (relative to other megafauna) because the water in which they live reduces the weight burden. Though they are bulky animals, <b>hippopotamuses</b> can gallop at [...] on land but normally trot. They are incapable of jumping but do climb up steep banks. Despite being semiaquatic and having webbed feet, an adult hippo is not a particularly good swimmer nor can it float. It is rarely found in deep water; when it is, the animal moves by porpoise-like leaps from the bottom. The eyes, ears, and nostrils of hippos are placed high on the roof of their skulls. This allows these organs to remain above the surface {{while the rest of the}} body submerges. The testes of the males descend only partially and a scrotum is not present. In addition, the penis retracts into the body when not erect. The genitals of the female are unusual in that the vagina is ridged and two large diverticula protrude from the vulval vestibule. The function of these is unknown.|$|E
500|$|<b>Hippopotamuses</b> {{are among}} the largest living land mammals, being only smaller than {{elephants}} and some rhinoceroses. Mean adult weight is around [...] and [...] {{for males and females}} respectively, very large males can reach [...] and exceptional males weighing [...] and [...] have been reported. Male hippos appear to continue growing throughout their lives while females reach maximum weight at around age 25.|$|E
500|$|Studying the {{interaction}} {{of male and female}} <b>hippopotamuses</b> has long been complicated because hippos are not sexually dimorphic; thus females and young males are almost indistinguishable in the field. Although hippos lie close to each other, they do not seem to form social bonds except between mothers and daughters, and they are not social animals. The reason they huddle close together is unknown. <b>Hippopotamuses</b> are territorial only in water, where a bull presides over a small stretch of river, on average [...] in length, and containing 10 females. The largest pods can contain over 100 hippos. Younger bachelors are allowed in a bull's stretch, as long as they behave submissively toward the bull. The territories of hippos exist to establish mating rights. Within the pods, the hippos tend to segregate by gender. Bachelors lounge near other bachelors, females with other females, and the bull on his own. When hippos emerge from the water to graze, they do so individually.|$|E
500|$|While {{the fossil}} record of hippos is still poorly understood, the two modern genera, Hippopotamus and Choeropsis (sometimes Hexaprotodon), may have diverged {{as far back as}} [...] Taxonomists {{disagree}} whether or not the modern pygmy hippopotamus is a member of Hexaprotodon – an apparently paraphyletic genus, also embracing many extinct Asian <b>hippopotamuses,</b> that is more closely related to Hippopotamus – or of Choeropsis, an older and basal genus.|$|E
500|$|The Hippopotamidae are {{believed}} to have evolved in Africa; the oldest known hippopotamid is the genus Kenyapotamus, which lived in Africa from 16 to [...] While hippopotamid species spread across Asia and Europe, no <b>hippopotamuses</b> have ever been discovered in the Americas, although various anthracothere genera emigrated into North America during the early Oligocene. From 7.5 to , an ancestor to the modern hippopotamus, Archaeopotamus, lived in Africa and the Middle East.|$|E
