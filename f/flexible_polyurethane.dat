Therefore two PU formulations with reaction kinetics similar to those encountered in practice are used.

It was seen that segmenting, <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethanes</b> with their lower crosslinking density, and the resultant pronounced or less pronounced thermoplastic phase that results from this during curing, have a greater processing window than is the case for systems that undergo pronounced crosslinking.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis research is to develop an adhesive bonding solution in order to remove the classic welding technology exploited nowadays in the automotive steel wheel system. The examined solution is an hybrid joint, based on adhesive boding combined {{with the presence of}} an interference fit. This hybrid joining technology consists in coupling two cylindrical components together by force-fitting one into the other after having placed an adhesive on the mating surfaces. This technique would allow the joining of dissimilar material to enable the design of hybrid lightweight wheels. Moreover, it would provide a better stress distribution in the joint area that could induce fatigue life improvement. The contributions of the adhesive and the interference on the performance of the final hybrid joint is still not completely clear. In particular, the effect of the adhesive nature and of its mechanical and adhesive responses on the performance of the hybrid joint is under concern in this research. A study of the phenomena acting at the interference level is conducted at the laboratory level before industrial case application. An experimental method is set up in order to test the adhesives in a press fit joint. Static and dynamic tests are carried out examining the behavior of different adhesives, including rigid epoxies and <b>flexible</b> <b>polyurethanes,</b> and fractographic analysis are then performed. The second part of the study is focused on the feasibility of the hybrid technology on the wheel system. Exploiting the outcomes of the laboratory analysis, bonded wheel prototypes are assembled and tested statically and dynamically, according to component validation in MW. From the laboratory scale analyses it is found that the adhesive type mainly affects the static resistance of the hybrid joint. In particular the curing technology affects the decoupling behavior and the rheology influences the quantity of adhesive that remains inside the joint despites the interference levels. On the other hand, the interference rules the stiffness of the assembly and strongly affects the fatigue behavior of the cylindrical joint. The study conducted on the wheel component confirms the laboratory scale outcomes. For what concern the feasibility study, the bonded wheel shows similar performances compared to the welded wheel without design modifications of the components. However, the joint geometry has to be redesigned to exploit all the advantages of the adhesive bondin...|$|R

Scanning electron microscopy, attenuated total reflectance-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy were used to assess changes in the surface chemical structure and morphology of the materials. Gel permeation chromatography, differential scanning calorimetry and tensile testing were used to examine changes in bulk characteristics of the materials. The results showed that the biostability of the soft <b>flexible</b> PDMS-based test <b>polyurethane</b> was significantly better than the control material of similar softness, Pellethane(R) 80 A, and as good as or better than both of the harder commercially available negative control polyurethanes. Pellethane(R) 55 D and Bionate(R) 55 D. Changes observed in the surface of the Pellethane(R) materials were consistent with oxidation of the aliphatic polyether soft segment and hydrolysis of the urethane bonds joining hard to soft segment with degradation in Pellethane(R) 80 A significantly more severe than that observed in Pellethane(R) 55 D. Very minor changes were seen on the surfaces of the Elast-Eon(TM) 2 80 A and Bionate(R) 55 D materials. There was a general trend of molecular weight decreasing with time across all polymers and the molecular weights of all materials decreased at a similar relative rate. The polydispersity ratio, M-w/M-n, increased with time for all materials. Tensile tests indicated that UTS increased in Elast-Eon(TM) 2 80 A and Bionate(R) 55 D following implantation under strained conditions.
