50|$|Based on the LNG SPAs, LNG {{is destined}} for pre-agreed destinations, and <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> that LNG is not allowed. However, if Seller and Buyer make a mutual agreement, then the <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> the <b>cargo</b> is permitted—subject to sharing the {{additional}} profit created {{by such a}} diversion. In the European Union and some other jurisdictions, it is not permitted to apply the profit-sharing clause in LNG SPAs.|$|R
40|$|An {{economic}} {{optimization model}} of waterborne containerized imports from Asia to the USA is described. Imports are allocated to alternative ports and logistics channels {{so as to}} minimize total transportation and inventory costs for each importer. Logistics channels include direct shipment of marine containers via truck or rail, and trans-loading in the hinterlands of the ports of entry from marine containers into domestic trailers or containers. The model was exercised with 2004 actual transportation costs, import volumes and declared values, plus a range of hypothetical container fees assessed on imports routed via the San Pedro Bay Ports. The results show that, without reductions in container movement lead times, container fees would result in significant <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes</b> to other ports. In contrast, if infrastructure is improved such that container movement lead times are significantly reduced, the model predicts little or no decrease in overall imports via San Pedro Bay but {{a substantial increase in}} trans-loaded imports for fees ranging up to $ 200 per container. ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to examine {{decongestion}} strategies used in inland container depots (ICDs) and container freight services (CFSs) at Tanzania sea ports. Specifically the study was to identify factors that contribute to the increased congestion of Tanzanian seaports; to assess the effects of congestion at Tanzania seaports; to identify some of the decongestion strategies implemented by Tanzania seaports managements and to investigate factors hindering implementation of the decongestion strategies. The study used survey design and involved questionnaires and interviews as the tools for data collection. The study also used secondary data collection methods such as documentation of various reports. The study found that lack <b>of</b> enough <b>cargo</b> handling equipments, small size of the port, large number of port users; poor port management and poor policy implementations were factors that contribute to the congestion at Dar es Salaam seaport. While the results of congestion was found to be loss of working time, cargos/parcels and income to the clients, ship traffic, delay of ship turn round time and lastly <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> <b>cargoes</b> from Dar es Salaam seaport to other ports especially Mombasa seaport. It was also found that in general decongestion strategies have been not fully implemented by Tanzania seaport management. The study recommended that government should assist in building and improvement some infrastructure which will meet current developments and technological changes in the shipping industr...|$|R

40|$|The article {{gives an}} account of the results of working out a {{generalized}} dynamic model <b>of</b> fixation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads jointly with flexible and thrust elements. Working out a generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> fixation is rather a complicated problem not in the sense of solving differential equations systems but in the sense of presenting them as a complex mechanical system “cargo – pads – flexible elements – thrust bars”. Generalized dynamic model <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads observed that this model represents technology of joint work of flexible and thrust fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> on rolling stock. In particular, {{on the basis of this}} model there can be obtained the technology models of joint work of flexible and elastic fastening means <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads <b>of</b> fastening flexible elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> with pads without thrust bars and also flexible fastening elements <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> without pads and thrust bars at asymmetrical and/or symmetrical allocation <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> in the wagon.

50|$|Visakhapatnam Port is {{undergoing}} a modernisation and expansion program aimed at increasing its capacity to 130 million tonnes by 2016-17, entailing an investment of 13,000 crores. The inauguration of the Gangavaram Port, located 15 km away from the Visakhapatnam Port, {{has led to a}} significant <b>diversion</b> <b>of</b> traffic away from the Visakhapatnam Port. This loss <b>of</b> <b>cargo</b> traffic is an important reason for the port's fall from its position as the largest port in India. The Rashtriya Ispat Nigam Limited (RINL) which runs the Vizag Steel Plant had shifted base to the new port, taking with it a large chunk of the coal and iron ore traffic. The Visakhapatnam Port is now modernising its coal handling berth in the outer harbour to enable it to handle capesize vessels. This will also solve the problem of air pollution caused by the open handling of coal that had earlier led to citywide protests.|$|R
