A plaza stretches out before the building, {{and a series of}} support columns <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> It was influenced by Le Corbusier's High Court building in Chandigarh, India; Pei sought to use the significant overhang to unify building and plaza. The project cost much more than initially expected, and took 11 years. Revenue was secured in part by including a subterranean parking garage. The interior of the city hall is large and spacious; windows in the ceiling above the eighth floor fill the main space with light.|$|E

The earth spirits disappear when he <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up.</b> The fairies express their surprise but are sure he will not triumph again. Meanwhile, he thanks Groma's power. Next they encounter bronze men who guard a holy sanctuary. The shield fails Arindal but when Groma advises him to hold up the sword, the bronze men vanish. The fairies again express their surprise whilst Groma's spirit urges Arindal on. They now have reached a grotto where Ada has been turned to stone. The two fairies taunt Arindal with the threat that failure will mean that he too is turned to stone. But the voice of Groma urges him to play the lyre. When he does so (O ihr, des Busens Hochgefühle), Ada is freed from the stone. The two fairies realise that Groma is responsible.|$|E

500|$|The [...] "Dual Spires enhanced" [...] video at the Psych website lists further {{references}} to Twin Peaks. Shawn's name for Gus in this episode is [...] "Lodge Blackmunn", a direct {{reference to the}} Black and White Lodge. Leo the Cinnamon Owl is a reference to Killer BOB, who possessed Leland Palmer and often {{took the form of}} an owl. The sheriff's deputy is Deputy Frost, named after Twin Peaks co-creator Mark Frost. The doctors of both Dual Spires and Twin Peaks have coconuts in their offices. Both Paula's and Laura's diaries described meetings with [...] "J". Sheriff Jackson tells Bob he needs to be strong for his wife. Dr Hayward says the same thing to Leland Palmer in Twin Peaks. Upon entering the town Gus mentions that the residents are looking {{at him as if he}} were the first black man they had ever seen. There are very few black men in Twin Peaks. When they enter the Sawmill Diner Bob Barker says [...] "Top of the morning to you." [...] In the first season of Twin Peaks, Pete Martell corrected Josie Packard on the saying. Maudette wears an orchid in her hair; Harold grew orchids in Twin Peaks. In the library Shawn asks if they can [...] "poke around" [...] but he and Gus immediately say [...] "peek" [...] in correction. Thus [...] "peek", as in Twin Peaks, is spoken twice. A man wearing a hat in the Sawmill Diner gives Shawn and Gus a thumbs up. The older room service attendant did the same thing to Agent Cooper in Twin Peaks. A record player is featured prominently in both the Barker and Palmer homes. The Roadhouse was also a location in Twin Peaks. Both Maudette and Audrey Horne love to dance. Paula's friend Jack is completely blind in one eye, referencing Twin Peaks' brothel named [...] "One Eyed Jacks". In the library Shawn and Gus find a book entitled [...] "Putt Your Way to a Better Future." [...] After Leland Palmer killed Maddy Ferguson he was seen putting golf balls around in his living room. When Randy is using the table saw it resembles the sawmill scene from the extended opening credits of Twin Peaks. When Maudette is placed in the body bag it is bent in such a way that it resembles a smile, like the smiling bag clue Agent Cooper found. On Maudette's desk beside her computer is a roll of green tape like the kind used by Leland Palmer to tie up Jacques Renault. In the cabin Bob Barker lights a match and <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> like Leland Palmer did when describing BOB to Agent Cooper. Bob Barker wears a gold ring on his pinky, something Agent Cooper did in Twin Peaks. In the cabin the walls are red with red drapes as an allusion to the [...] "Red Room" [...] in Agent Cooper's dream.|$|E

"In {{the same}} manner a small round piece of bread, shaped like a large wafer, when consecrated by the priest's prayers, becomes, they think, really and truly the body of Christ; and the priest by eating it {{performs}} a sacrifice, just as he does by drinking the wine. When he has consecrated this wafer, he <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> for a moment, that the people may look upon it; and they, in looking upon it, think they see {{a portion of the}} true body of Christ, which is about to be offered up by the priest as a sacrifice for their sins." ...|$|E

He compels men like me to recognize that our movements are not merely moral, but religious. Religion, as yet unidentified, is the force behind these portentous stirrings of politics in our country, from sea to sea. He aims, not to bring the Church into politics, but to make her the feeder of these movements.

6000|$|There is {{literally}} {{no end to}} the modes by which persons having the charge of young children can avail themselves of their vivid imaginative powers in inculcating moral lessons or influencing their conduct.

[...] "No, father, I mean to look well over the ground, and not play in any place where there is any danger at all." [...] "Well, we shall see; but the little rogue is determined to hide somewhere." [...] The boy takes his ball and goes out to play with it, far more effectually cautioned than he could have been by any direct admonition.|$|E
60|$|Whereupon they separated, and Montroymont rode briskly {{down into}} the Dule Valley. But of the curate Francis {{was not to be}} quit so easily. He went on with his little, brisk steps to the corner of a dyke, and stopped and whistled and waved upon a lassie that was herding cattle there. This Janet M‘Clour was a big lass, being taller than the curate; and what made her look the more so, she was kilted very high. It seemed for a while she would not come, and Francie heard her calling Haddo a ‘daft auld fule,’ and saw her running and dodging him among the whins and hags till he was fairly blown. But at the last he gets a bottle from his plaid-neuk and <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to her; whereupon she came at once into a composition, and the pair sat, {{drinking}} of the bottle, and daffing and laughing together, on a mound of heather. The boy had scarce heard of these vanities, or he might have been minded of a nymph and satyr, if anybody could have taken long-leggit Janet for a nymph. But they seemed to be huge friends, he thought; and was the more surprised, when the curate had taken his leave, to see the lassie fling stones after him with screeches of laughter, and Haddo turn about and caper, and shake his staff at her, and laugh louder than herself. A wonderful merry pair, they seemed; and when Francie had crawled out of the hag, he had a great deal to consider in his mind. It was possible they were all fallen in error about Mr. Haddo, he reflected—having seen him so tender with Montroymont, and so kind and playful with the lass Janet; and he had a temptation to go out of his road and question her herself upon the matter. But he had a strong spirit of duty on him; and plodded on instead over the braes till he came near the House of Cairngorm. There, in a hollow place by the burnside that was shaded by some birks, he was aware of a barefoot boy, perhaps a matter of three years older than himself. The two approached with the precautions of a pair of strange dogs, looking at each other queerly.|$|E
60|$|This much {{being said}} as to incurable vice of method, {{and there are}} fervent disciples of Rousseau now living who will regard one's craving for method in talking about men as a foible of pedantry, we may briefly remark {{on one or two}} {{detached}} objections to Rousseau's story. To begin with, there is no certainty as to there having ever been a state of nature of a normal and organic kind, any more than there is any one normal and typical state of society now. There are infinitely diverse states of society, and there were probably as many diverse states of nature. Rousseau was sufficiently acquainted with the most recent metaphysics of his time to know that you cannot think of a tree in general, nor of a triangle in general, but only of some particular tree or triangle.[189] In a similar way he might have known that there never was any such thing as a state of nature in the general and abstract, fixed, typical, and single. He speaks of the savage state also, which comes next, as one, identical, normal. It is, of course, nothing of the kind. The varieties of belief and habit and custom among the different tribes of savages, in reference to every object that can engage their attention, from death and the gods and immortality down to the uses of marriage and the art of counting and the ways of procuring subsistence, are infinitely numerous; and the more we know about this vast diversity, the less easy is it to think of the savage state in general. When Rousseau extols the savage state as the veritable youth of the world, we wonder whether we are to think of the negroes of the Gold Coast, or the Dyaks of Borneo, Papuans or Maoris, Cheyennes or Tierra-del-Fuegians or the fabled Troglodytes; whether in the veritable youth of the world they counted up to five or only to two; whether they used a fire-drill, and if so what kind of drill; whether they had the notion of personal identity in so weak a shape as to practise the couvade; and a hundred other points, which we should now require any writer to settle, who should speak of the savage state as sovereign, one, and indivisible, {{in the way in which}} Rousseau speaks of it, and <b>holds</b> <b>it</b> <b>up</b> to our vain admiration.|$|E
