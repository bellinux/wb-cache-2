Barry Walters, writing in The Village Voice, similarly writes that [...] "there's little on Parachutes that demands attention or punctures the pensive spell, and, unlike Travis's, Coldplay's hooks are slight."

500|$|The {{album was}} {{critically}} acclaimed {{at the time}} of release, especially in the US rock press. It was favourably compared to contemporary works, namely Tommy by The Who, released earlier in the year. In Rolling Stone magazine, Arthur was spotlighted in its lead section, with back-to-back reviews by Mike Daly and Greil Marcus. Daly called it [...] "an album that is a masterpiece on every level: Ray Davies' finest hour, the Kinks' supreme achievement". Rolling Stone reviewer J.R. Young also praised the record, and said: [...] "Less ambitious than Tommy, and far more musical ... Arthur is by all odds the best British album of 1969. It shows that Pete Townshend still has worlds to conquer and that The Beatles have a lot of catching up to do." [...] A review by Sal Imam ran in Boston's Fusion magazine read that [...] "If Tommy was the greatest rock opera, then Arthur most surely is the greatest rock musical." [...] Writing in his Consumer <b>Guide</b> <b>column</b> of The Village Voice, Robert Christgau gave the record a positive review, saying that although Ray Davies' lyrics could get [...] "petulant and preachy at times", the album featured [...] "excellent music and production".|$|E
500|$|Although the Flash is {{generally}} regarded as the first superhero of the Silver Age, {{the introduction of the}} Martian Manhunter in Detective Comics #225 predates Showcase #4 by almost a year, and at least one historian considers this character the first Silver Age superhero. However, comics historian Craig Shutt, author of the Comics Buyer's <b>Guide</b> <b>column</b> [...] "Ask Mister Silver Age", disagrees, noting that the Martian Manhunter debuted as a detective who used his alien abilities to solve crimes, in the [...] "quirky detective" [...] vein of contemporaneous DC characters who were [...] "TV detectives, Indian detectives, supernatural detectives, [...] animal detectives." [...] Schutt feels the Martian Manhunter only became a superhero in Detective Comics #273 (Nov. 1959) when he received a secret identity and other superhero accoutrements, saying, [...] "Had Flash not come along, I doubt that the Martian Manhunter would've led the charge from his backup position in Detective to a new super-hero age." [...] Unsuccessful attempts to revive the superhero archetype's popularity include Captain Comet, who debuted in Strange Adventures #9 (June 1951); St. John Publishing Company's 1953 revival of Rocket Man under the title Zip-Jet; Fighting American, created in 1954 by the Captain America team of Joe Simon and Jack Kirby; Sterling Comics' Captain Flash and its backup feature Tomboy that same year; Ajax/Farrell Publishing's 1954-55 revival of the Phantom Lady; Strong Man, published by Magazine Enterprises in 1955; Charlton Comics' Nature Boy, introduced in March 1956, and its revival of the Blue Beetle the previous year; and Atlas Comics' short-lived revivals of Captain America, the Human Torch, and the Sub-Mariner, beginning in Young Men Comics #24 (Dec. 1953).|$|E

5000|$|Due to the comic's extreme (for the time) {{portrayal}} of violence, however, distributor {{reaction to the}} first issue of the limited series was negative.

30|$|In {{specimen}} RC- 2.0, {{made with}} normal concrete, bundled diagonal reinforcement and code-specified transverse reinforcement, inclined cracks {{began to develop}} at approximately 0.25 % drift. By 2 % drift, the width of inclined cracks increased to about 1.5  mm (Fig.  8 a), and most diagonal bars underwent yielding near the beam-stub interfaces. At 5 % drift, the inclined cracks widened to greater than 4.5  mm, and some spalling of concrete under compression occurred at the beam ends (Fig.  8 b). Slight buckling in the diagonal bundled bars was observed. Eventually, at about 7 % drift, RC- 2.0 started to collapse owing to the rupture of some diagonal bars (Fig.  8 c). It is noted that the crack patterns were somewhat asymmetric (Fig.  8) even though {{the rotation of the}} top stub (reaction block) was restrained by the supports of the <b>guide</b> <b>columns.</b> This may be resulted from an imperfect installation of the test setup.|$|R
