5|$|In January 2014 Gascoigne entered rehab for his alcohol {{addiction}} for a seventh {{time at a}} £6,000-a-month clinic in Southampton. In August he was again admitted to hospital in relation to his problems following an incident outside his home. On 23 October 2014, police were called {{to his home in}} Poole after he was in a drink binge; he was sectioned under the Mental Health Act the next day and taken to a hospital for a three-day <b>detox.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{length of}} time that <b>Detox</b> had been record for, {{as well as the}} limited amount of {{material}} that had been officially released or leaked from the recording sessions, had given it considerable notoriety within the music industry. Numerous release dates (including the ones mentioned above) had been given for the album over the years since it was first announced, although none of them transpired to be genuine. Several musicians closely affiliated with Dr. Dre, including Snoop Dogg, fellow rappers 50 Cent and Game and producer DJ Quik, had speculated in interviews that the album will never be released, due to Dr. Dre's business and entrepreneurial ventures having interfered with recording work, as well as causing him to lose motivation to record new material.|$|E

25|$|Binge {{drinking}} {{is associated with}} increased impulsivity, impairments in spatial working memory and impaired emotional learning. These adverse effects {{are believed to be}} due to the neurotoxic effects of repeated withdrawal from alcohol on aberrant neuronal plasticity and cortical damage. Repeated periods of acute intoxication followed by acute detoxification has profound effects on the brain and is associated with an increased risk of seizures as well as cognitive deficits. The effects on the brain are similar to those seen in alcoholics who have been detoxified multiple times but not as severe as in alcoholics who have no history of prior <b>detox.</b> Thus the acute withdrawal syndrome appears {{to be the most important}} factor in causing damage or impairment to brain function. The brain regions most sensitive to harm from binge drinking are the amygdala and prefrontal cortex.|$|E
25|$|In the Clinic sample, 100 severe alcoholics {{treated at}} the clinic were {{followed}} for 8 years. The clinic’s methods were multi-modal: detoxification and hospital treatment followed by referral to AA. At {{the end of the}} 8 years, 34% of subjects had achieved stable abstinence, 29% had died, and 26% were still abusing alcohol, and the evidence was that other clinical studies had reported similar lack of success. Subjects who had a stable social environment or who frequently went to AA meetings had the highest rates of abstinence. Overall, however, treatment other than AA did not significantly improve the subjects’ outcome. In fact Vaillant reports the dismal fact that fully 95% of the Clinic sample had relapsed at some time during the 8-year study period. Vaillant noted that clinical treatment helped only in the short term, as crisis intervention and <b>detox.</b> There was one indicator, a financial one, of short-term success: clinical intervention had significantly reduced the cost of future health care for the alcoholics.|$|E

25|$|Increased {{respiration}} rates {{caused by}} mutated COXI {{may have caused}} two additional traits in the Utricularia–Genlisea clade: i) greatly increased rates of nucleotide substitution and ii) a dynamic decrease of genome size, including Utricularia species {{with some of the}} smallest haploid angiosperm genomes known. A recent study conducted three cDNA libraries from different organs of U.gibba (~80Mb) as part of a large scale Utricularia nuclear genome sequencing project. They recorded increased nucleotide substitution rates in chloroplast, mitochondrial, and cellular genomes. They also recorded increased levels of DNA repair-associated proteins and reactive oxygen species (ROS)-detox. ROS is a product of cellular metabolism that can potentially cause cellular damage when accumulated in high amounts. Interestingly, they determined the expression of DNA repair and ROS <b>detox</b> was ubiquitous rather than trap-specific. Due to this ubiquitous expression, relative ROS detoxification is expected to be lower in trap structures due to the high respiratory rate caused by trap activations, eventually leading to higher toxic effects and mutagenesis. Mutagenic action of enhanced ROS production may explain both high rates of nucleotide substitution and the dynamic evolution of genome size (via double strand breaks).|$|E
500|$|In 2007, Dr. Dre's third studio album, {{formerly}} known as <b>Detox,</b> was slated to be his final studio album. Work for the upcoming album dates back to 2001, where its first version was called [...] "the most advanced rap album ever", by producer Scott Storch. Later that same year, he decided to stop working on the album to focus on producing for other artists, but then changed his mind; the album had initially been set for a fall 2005 release. Producers confirmed {{to work on the}} album include DJ Khalil, Nottz, Bernard [...] "Focus" [...] Edwards Jr., Hi-Tek, J.R. Rotem, RZA, Jay-Z, Warren G, and Boi-1da. Snoop Dogg claimed that <b>Detox</b> was finished, according to a June 2008 report by Rolling Stone magazine. After another delay based on producing other artists' work, <b>Detox</b> was then scheduled for a 2010 release, coming after 50 Cent's Before I Self Destruct and Eminem's Relapse, an album for which Dr. Dre handled the bulk of production duties. In a Dr Pepper commercial that debuted on May 28, 2009, he premiered the first official snippet of <b>Detox.</b> 50 Cent and Eminem asserted in an interview on BET's 106 & Park that Dr. Dre had around a dozen songs finished for <b>Detox.</b>|$|E

40|$|A {{recent report}} in Ireland {{identified}} {{that two-thirds of}} poisoning deaths involved poly drug use {{with an average of}} four different drugs involved. Of these, benzodiazepines were the most common drug group involved. Concern has been expressed regarding high levels of benzodiazepine prescriptions globally. Community-based detoxification programs are required, but detoxification is complex with associated high risks, such as overdose. This study utilized a survey to gather the experiences of a range of drug workers in addiction settings in the southern region of Ireland who are tasked with the management of supporting service users who wish to detoxify from benzodiazepines. The {{purpose of this study is}} to identify the issues highlighted in the data and consequently inform policy development, service delivery, future training, and pathways to support service users (SUs). Findings indicate that, while practitioners had high levels of confidence in managing community-based <b>detoxes,</b> levels of knowledge of schedules, contraindications, access to support, and appropriate referral pathways were limited. Barriers to supporting <b>detoxes</b> emerged, emphasizing the importance of multidisciplinary and interagency care planning.
