5|$|The gold {{standard}} for judging imaging methods is contrast venography, which involves injecting a peripheral vein of the affected limb with a contrast agent and taking X-rays, to reveal whether the venous supply has been obstructed.

5|$|A {{circular}} {{hole was}} {{cut into the}} backdrop {{and covered with a}} transparent material. A strong light behind this hole represented the moon. The light was occasionally manipulated to suggest the passage of clouds. Gautier and St. Georges wanted the pool to be made of large mirrors but Pillet rejected this idea because of <b>its</b> <b>cost.</b> In the 1868 revival, however, mirrors were acquired for this scene.|$|E

5|$|The Modi {{government}} {{finished the}} process of bringing electricity to every village in Gujarat that its predecessor had almost completed. Modi significantly changed the state's system of power distribution, greatly impacting farmers. Gujarat expanded the Jyotigram Yojana scheme, in which agricultural electricity was separated from other rural electricity; the agricultural electricity was rationed to fit scheduled irrigation demands, reducing <b>its</b> <b>cost.</b> Although early protests by farmers ended when those who benefited found that their electricity supply had stabilised, according to an assessment study corporations and large farmers benefited from the policy {{at the expense of}} small farmers and labourers.|$|E

5|$|Both {{the commons}} and King Richard II were {{enthusiastic}} about the launch of a crusade to Flanders, {{for political and economic}} reasons: revenues from the English wool staple (that had ceased following the advance of the French) could be resumed; sending the bishop and not the king or his uncles to Flanders would enable John of Gaunt's unpopular plans for a royal crusade to Castille to be abandoned; French forces would be drawn away from the Iberian peninsula; and Anglo-Flemish relations would be strengthened. Another advantage in approving a crusade was that <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> would be borne by the Church and not by means of government levies: ever since the Peasants' Revolt, the government was fearful of the consequences of imposing a tax to pay for a new war against the French.|$|E
5|$|By 2012 {{the scandal}} had {{developed}} {{into one of}} the biggest and longest-lived loss-concealing financial scandals in the history of corporate Japan; it had wiped 75–80% off the company's stock market valuation, led to the resignation of much of the board, investigations across Japan, the UK and US, the arrest of 11 past or present Japanese directors, senior managers, auditors and bankers of Olympus for alleged criminal activities or cover-up, and raised considerable turmoil and concern over Japan's prevailing corporate governance and transparency and the Japanese financial markets. Woodford received a reported £10 million ($16 m) in damages from Olympus for defamation and wrongful dismissal in 2012; around the same time, Olympus also announced it would shed 2,700 jobs (7% of its workforce) and around 40 percent of its 30 manufacturing plants by 2015 to reduce <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> base.|$|E
5|$|City {{recreation}} facilities {{include two}} ice hockey arenas, a curling rink, an indoor swimming pool, an outdoor ice rink, and a speed skating oval. The South Peace Community Multiplex, {{a new facility}} completed in 2010, boasts a pool, indoor rodeo grounds and ice rink. Voters approved building the Multiplex in a 2004 referendum which projected <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> at C$21.6 million. The project became controversial when construction began and the cost projection was raised to $35 million. The facility is located close to the city's exhibition grounds, away from residential uses. It features an indoor rodeo arena and a 4,000-seat convention centre/ice arena with skyboxes. Nearby Bear Mountain, located south of the city, provides over 20km (12mi) of snowshoeing and cross-country skiing trails, as well as areas for downhill skiing and about 500km (300mi) of trails for snowmobiles, mountain bikes, and all-terrain vehicles. The city was once home to a North American Hockey League team, the Dawson Creek Rage, beginning in the 2010–11 season until it ceased operations in 2012 due to financial difficulties.|$|E

5|$|Implementation of the Bland–Allison Act {{did not end}} {{calls for}} free silver. The 1880s saw a steep decline in the prices of grain and other {{agricultural}} commodities. Silver advocates argued that this dropoff, which caused the price of grain to fall below <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> of production, {{was caused by the}} failure of the government to adequately increase the money supply, which had remained steady on a per capita basis. Advocates of the gold standard attributed the decline to advances in production and transportation. The late 19th century saw divergent views in economics as the laissez-faire orthodoxy was questioned by younger economists, and both sides found ample support for their views from theorists.|$|E
5|$|Made on {{a budget}} of 180 million {{including}} production, prints and advertising, and marketing, Mary Kom earned 200 million, and before release recouped more than <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> from brand tie-ups. The film made profits before the release. Partnership was arranged {{in a way that}} the products from brands were either showcased in the film or the brands promoted the film in their advertising. The satellite rights of the film were sold for 140 million and music rights for 30 million. The film was released in DVDs on 15 October 2014 across all regions in a one-disc pack in NTSC format. Distributed by Shemaroo Entertainment, it contained behind-the-scene footage and deleted scenes. The VCD and Blu-ray versions were released at the same time. The Mary Kom Blu-ray is the first Blu-ray title in India to feature a Dolby Atmos soundtrack.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{proposals}} {{were made to}} remedy this problem, and in 1865, the mayor of Brussels, Jules Anspach, selected a design by architect Léon Suys to cover the river and build a series of grand boulevards and public buildings. The project faced fierce opposition and controversy, mostly due to <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> {{and the need for}} expropriation and demolition of working-class neighbourhoods. The construction was contracted to a British company, but control was returned to the government following an embezzlement scandal. This delayed the project, but it was still completed in 1871. Its completion allowed the construction of the modern buildings and boulevards which are central to downtown Brussels today.|$|E

5|$|Prevention of {{alcoholism}} may be attempted by regulating and limiting {{the sale of}} alcohol, taxing alcohol to increase <b>its</b> <b>cost,</b> and providing inexpensive treatment. Treatment may take several steps. Because of the medical problems that can occur during withdrawal, alcohol detoxification should be carefully controlled. One common method {{involves the use of}} benzodiazepine medications, such as diazepam. This can be either given while admitted to a health care institution or occasionally while a person remains in the community with close supervision. Other addictions or mental illness may complicate treatment. After detoxification support such as group therapy or support groups are used to help keep a person from returning to drinking. One commonly used form of support is the group Alcoholics Anonymous. The medications acamprosate, disulfiram, or naltrexone may also be used to help prevent further drinking.|$|E

However, they announced {{at the start of the}} session that their proposal would not include an immediate moratorium on insurance mandates, and the legislation was killed on its first hearing in a House committee. Roberts also withdrew one of her proposals to continue a pilot program for training of Certified Nursing Assistants, on account of <b>its</b> <b>cost.</b> Roberts also sponsored a contentious piece of legislation with general election opponent Sen. Bruce Whitehead, negotiated by Governor Ritter's office, to require utilities to convert some Front Range coal-fired power plants to natural gas.|$|E
5|$|The $46.9 million {{station was}} opened during a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} on February 4, 2002, attended by Everett Mayor Ed Hansen, Governor Gary Locke, U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel and Sound Transit Board chairman and King County Executive Ron Sims. Initially, only Everett Transit and Community Transit operated {{out of the}} station on opening day, but they were quickly joined by Sound Transit Express service the following day and Greyhound intercity bus service that summer. Amtrak was initially expected to begin serving Everett Station in July 2002, but the construction of a passing track delayed the move of the Cascades and Empire Builder from Bond Street Station to November 12. Construction of a Sounder commuter rail platform and rail spur was approved by the Everett City Council in September 2002, pending reimbursement from Sound Transit and Amtrak for <b>its</b> <b>cost</b> of $726,000. Sounder service to King Street Station in Seattle via Edmonds began with special Seattle Seahawks gameday service on December 22, 2003, carrying 700 passengers on the inaugural run of the Sounder North Line.|$|E
