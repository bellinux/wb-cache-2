50|$|The almanac {{consists}} of coarse orbit and status information for each satellite in the constellation, an ionospheric model, and information to relate GPS derived time to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC). Each frame contains {{a part of}} the almanac (in subframes 4 and 5) and the complete almanac is transmitted by each satellite in 25 frames total (requiring 12.5 minutes). The almanac serves several purposes. The first is to assist in the acquisition of satellites at power-up by allowing the receiver to generate a list of visible satellites based on stored position and time, while an ephemeris from each satellite is needed to compute position fixes using that satellite. In older hardware, lack of an almanac in a new receiver would cause long delays before providing a valid position, because the search for each satellite was a slow process. Advances in hardware have made the acquisition process much faster, so not having an almanac is no longer an issue. The second purpose is for relating time derived from the GPS (called GPS time) to the international time standard of UTC. Finally, the almanac allows a single-frequency receiver to correct for ionospheric <b>delay</b> <b>error</b> by using a global ionospheric model. The corrections are not as accurate as GNSS augmentation systems like WAAS or dual-frequency receivers. However, it is often better than no correction, since ionospheric error is the largest error source for a single-frequency GPS receiver.|$|E

40|$|The {{dead-time}} effect, as {{an intrinsic}} {{problem of the}} converters based on the half-bridge unit, leads to distortions in the converter output. Although several dead-time effect compensation or elimination methods have been proposed, they cannot fully remove the dead-time effect of blanking <b>delay</b> <b>error,</b> because the output current polarity is difficult detect accurately. This paper utilizes the zero-voltage-switching (ZVT) technique to eliminate the blanking <b>delay</b> <b>error,</b> which is {{the main drawback of}} the hard-switching inverter, although the technique initially aims to improve the efficiency. A typical ZVT inverter—the auxiliary resonant snubber inverter (ARSI) is analyzed. The blanking <b>delay</b> <b>error</b> is completely eliminated in the ARSI. Another error source caused by the finite rise- and fall-times of the voltage is analyzed, which was not considered in the hard-switching inverter. A compensation method based on the voltage error estimation is proposed to compensate the rise- and fall-error. A prototype was developed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control. Both the simulation and experimental results demonstrate that the qualities of the output current and voltage in the ARSI are better than that in the hard-switching inverter due to the elimination of the blanking <b>delay</b> <b>error.</b> The total harmonic distortion (THD) of the output is further reduced by using the proposed compensation method in the ARSI...|$|E

When the DLL is initialized on a secondary peak, both MMSES and DE converge to a zero <b>delay</b> <b>error,</b> whereas BJ {{is characterized by a}} steady-state error of about - 0.15 chips. This phenomenon is better investigated in Figure 15 b and 15 c where different error trajectories for the initial 4 s are shown for MMSES and BJ, respectively. These trajectories show the evolution of the <b>delay</b> <b>error</b> as a function of time and for different simulation runs. In the MMSES case, all the trajectories tend to reach a zero steady state error whereas the BJ code error is characterized by two different behaviors. In some cases, the BJ decision logic correctly detects the false peak lock and the code <b>delay</b> <b>error</b> is corrected accordingly. In other cases, however, tracking is too noisy and the algorithm is unable to recover the false peak lock as seen in Figure 15 c. The curves in Figure 15 a summarize the average behaviors of the three considered algorithms determining the average tracking error defined in (28). Only MMSES and DE are able to provide a completely unambiguous BOC tracking. While all the three techniques behave similarly for high C/N 0 ratios, BJ technique has higher probability to lose lock and track secondary peaks for low C/N 0 s.|$|E

However, it is also found that the method is affected by the random noise, which may induce the improper estimation of integral constants and consequently affect the ionospheric correction. Moreover, the severe deformation signals in the interferogram may lead to the estimation error of integral constants and scaling factor. Therefore, it should mask out the deformation signals when using the azimuth offsets method to correct the ionospheric error.

Although several methods have been proposed to mitigate the ionospheric phase delay, the application of these methods has not been fully investigated. In this study, an application of two ionospheric mitigating methods, azimuth offset and Faraday Rotation (FR), is investigated and analysed through processing two Phased Array type L-band Synthetic Aperture Radar onboard the Advanced Land Observing Satellite- 1 full-polarimetric SAR images over Alaska. The result indicates that both methods can effectively mitigate the ionospheric phase <b>delay</b> <b>error</b> for SAR interferometry, where the standard deviations of the ionosphere-corrected result have decreased to 3. 2  cm for FR-based method and 2. 0  cm for azimuth offset method compared to those before correction (7. 3  cm).

40|$|Multi-rate {{adaptive}} filters {{have been}} used in various ap-plications with numerous advantages such as low computa-tional load, fast convergence and build in parallelism allow-ing efficient hardware implementation. Drawbacks when us-ing multi-rate processing are mainly related to aliasing and reconstruction effects.

The analysis filter bank is first de-signed with minimum inband aliasing and approximately lin-ear phase in the passband. From a given analysis filter bank, the synthesis filter bank is designed with minimum residual aliasing between subbands while controlling the amplitude and delay distortion level for each frequency component di-rectly. Accurate approximations for the group <b>delay</b> <b>errors</b> are derived for both designed problems.

40|$|Context: Fourier {{transform}} (or lag) correlators {{in radio}} interferometers {{can serve as}} an efficient means of synthesising spectral channels. However aliasing corrupts the edge channels so they usually have to be excluded from the data set. In systems with around 10 channels, the loss in sensitivity can be significant. In addition, {{the low level of}} residual aliasing in the remaining channels may cause systematic <b>errors.</b> Moreover, <b>delay</b> <b>errors</b> have been widely reported in implementations of broadband analogue correlators and simulations have shown that <b>delay</b> <b>errors</b> exasperate the effects of aliasing. Aims: We describe a software-based approach that suppresses aliasing by oversampling the cross-correlation function. This method can be applied to interferometers with individually-tracking antennas equipped with a discrete path compensator system. It is based on the well-known property of interferometers where the drift scan response is the Fourier transform of the source's band-limited spectrum. Methods: In this paper, we simulate a single baseline interferometer, both for a real and a complex correlator. Fringe-rotation usually compensates for the phase of the fringes to bring the phase centre in line with the tracking centre. Instead, a modified fringe-rotation is applied. This enables an oversampled cross-correlation function to be reconstructed by gathering successive time samples. Results: Simulations show that the oversampling method can synthesise the cross-power spectrum while avoiding aliasing and works robustly in the presence of noise. An important side benefit is that it naturally accounts for <b>delay</b> <b>errors</b> in the correlator and the resulting spectral channels are regularly gridded.
