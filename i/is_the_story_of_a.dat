25|$|The {{early history}} of Gujarat {{reflects}} the imperial grandeur of Chandragupta Maurya who conquered a number of earlier states {{in what is now}} Gujarat. Pushyagupta, a Vaishya, was appointed the governor of Saurashtra by the Mauryan regime. He ruled Giringer (modern day Junagadh) (322 BC to 294 BC) and built a dam on the Sudarshan lake. Emperor Ashoka, the grandson of Chandragupta Maurya, not only ordered engraving of his edicts on the rock at Junagadh but asked Governor Tusherpha to cut canals from the lake where an earlier Mauryan governor had built a dam. Between the decline of Mauryan power and Saurashtra coming under the sway of the Samprati Mauryas of Ujjain, there was an Indo-Greek incursion into Gujarat led by Demetrius. In {{the first half of the}} 1st century AD, there <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> merchant of King Gondaphares landing in Gujarat with Apostle Thomas.
