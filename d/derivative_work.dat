5|$|Necrid's design {{targeted}} North American audiences, specifically fans of American comic books. Although McFarlane received most of {{the credit}} for the character, Necrid {{was the result of a}} collaboration; Namco outlined the then-unnamed character's traits, such as his in-game role and physical build, and McFarlane's company completed the design. As a result, both companies hold a partial copyright for Necrid, with Namco's rights to the character as a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> of McFarlane's illustrations.|$|E

25|$|Appley Dapply's Nursery Rhymes is a {{collection}} of nursery rhymes written and illustrated by Beatrix Potter, and published by Frederick Warne & Co. in October 1917. Potter had a lifelong fascination with rhymes, and proposed a book of short verses called Appley Dapply to Warne following the release of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902. Warne preferred Potter's original fantasies to her <b>derivative</b> <b>work,</b> and gave Appley Dapply little encouragement. The book was set aside in favour of other projects.|$|E
25|$|One {{potential}} workaround to licensing incompatibility was trialed in 2006, with {{an experimental}} port of the ZFS code to Linux's FUSE system. The filesystem ran entirely in userspace {{instead of being}} integrated into the Linux kernel, and was therefore not considered a <b>derivative</b> <b>work</b> of the kernel. This approach was functional, but suffered from significant performance penalties when compared with integrating the filesystem as a native kernel module running in kernel space. As of 2016, the ZFS on FUSE project appears to be defunct.|$|E
25|$|The dating of {{the poems}} {{has been a source}} of lively {{scholarly}} argument for a long time, and firm conclusions are hard to reach.

For example, Eyvindr skáldaspillir composed in the latter half of the 10th century, and he uses a couple of lines in his Hákonarmál which are also found in Hávamál. It is possible that he was quoting a known poem, but it is also possible that Hávamál, or at least the strophe in question, is the younger <b>derivative</b> <b>work.</b>|$|E

25|$|Although the ZFS {{filesystem}} supports Linux-based operating systems, difficulties arise for Linux distribution maintainers {{wishing to}} provide native support for ZFS in their products due to potential legal incompatibilities between the CDDL license {{used by the}} ZFS code, and the GPL license used by the Linux kernel. To enable ZFS support within Linux, a loadable kernel module containing the CDDL-licensed ZFS code must be compiled and loaded into the kernel. According to the Free Software Foundation, {{the wording of the}} GPL license legally prohibits redistribution of the resulting product as a <b>derivative</b> <b>work,</b> though this viewpoint has caused some controversy.|$|E
25|$|Following the {{publication}} of The Tale of Peter Rabbit in 1902, Potter planned a book of nursery rhymes called Appley Dapply, but Warne preferred her original (rather than her <b>derivative</b> <b>work)</b> and offered only modest encouragement. The project was dear to Potter's heart, and she continued to develop the concept while working on other productions for Warne. Potter planned Appley Dapply as a large format book with page borders and decorations in a style reminiscent of Walter Crane and Randolph Caldecott, and even considered publishing the book at her own expense if Warne lost what little interest {{he had in the}} project. In late 1904 she offered Warne a dummy book of ninety-four pages and thirty rhymes, twenty-one of which Warne approved for future publication. When Warne died suddenly and unexpectedly in August 1905, the book of rhymes was set aside, and Potter turned her attention to other projects.|$|E
25|$|The title Handbook for a Confessor (also Old English Handbook, or in full, Late Old English Handbook for the Use of a Confessor), {{refers to}} a {{compilation}} of Old English and Latin penitential texts associated with – and possibly authored or adapted by – Wulfstan (II), Archbishop of York (d. 1023). The handbook was intended {{for the use of}} parish priests in hearing confession and determining penances. Its transmission in the manuscripts (see below) seems to bear witness to Wulfstan's profound concern with these sacraments and their regulation, an impression which is similarly borne out by his Canons of Edgar, a guide of ecclesiastical law also targeted at priests. The handbook is a <b>derivative</b> <b>work,</b> based largely on earlier vernacular representatives of the penitential genre such as the Scrifboc (or Confessionale Pseudo-Ecgberhti) and the Old English Penitential (or Paenitentiale Pseudo-Ecgberhti). Nevertheless, a unique quality seems to lie in the more or less systematic way it seeks to integrate various points of concern, including the proper formulae for confession and instructions on the administration of confession, the prescription of penances and their commutation.|$|E
