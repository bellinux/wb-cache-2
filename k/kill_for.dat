25|$|Towards {{the end of}} her life, Machali lost {{almost all}} of her teeth, sight in one eye, and much of her {{strength}} due to aging. She also lost her territory, as her daughter Sundari from her last litter drove her out of her turf. As she was unable to hunt and <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> herself, park staff provided her with food. This intervention became somewhat controversial; tiger expert K Ullas Karanth commented that it resulted in Machali living longer than she should have, and that truly wild animals should be born, live and die naturally.|$|E

25|$|In May 2007 it was {{announced}} that Rodríguez had signed on to direct a remake of Barbarella for a 2008 release. At the 2007 Comic-Con convention, actress Rosario Dawson announced that because of Barbarella, production of Sin City: A Dame to <b>Kill</b> <b>For</b> would be put on hold. She also announced that she would be playing an amazon in the Barbarella film. As of June 2008, plans to remake the film Barbarella with Rose McGowan as the lead have been delayed; the actress and director are instead remaking the film Red Sonja.|$|E
25|$|In 1861 {{the city}} of Kingston had {{considered}} buying the land around Bishop's Falls near Ashokan to dam and use as a reservoir. It dropped the idea quickly since the creek's waters were still fouled by tanning effluents. A quarter-century later it took a second look, and found the waters had returned to their pristine state with the tanneries gone. It eventually developed Cooper Lake (New York) on {{a tributary of the}} Saw <b>Kill,</b> <b>for</b> its water needs instead, after the privately owned Ramapo Water Company bought the rights.|$|E

Gabreski confronted him and angrily ordered him to change his mission report, confirming Whisner's own role in the kill. Whisner refused. Soon after, Gabreski recanted his anger and the two shared the claim, {{as a consequence of}} which three days later Whisner and not Gabreski became the first pilot of the 51st FW to reach jet ace status.|$|E

25|$|Most of JG 27 {{avoided the}} final defeat of Axis forces in Africa, in Tunisia. After {{withdrawing}} to airfields in western Cyrenica, and having abandoned {{a large number}} of its aircraft along the way, the unit passed the remainder of its aircraft to JG 77 and were then evacuated from North Africa on 12 November. II./JG 27 remained nearly a month longer, based at Merduma airfield. During that month the Gruppe lost three pilots killed for six Allied fighters destroyed. The last of these kills, a Kittyhawk, was the first <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> Leutnant Hans Lewes of 6. Staffel, in the final sortie by JG 27 in Africa, on the morning of 6 December 1942.|$|E
25|$|Since 1998, he {{has owned}} the film rights to Mike Allred's off-beat comic Madman. The two have hinted at the project {{being close to}} {{beginning}} on several occasions without anything coming of it. However, other projects have been completed first (Allred was instrumental in connecting Rodríguez with Frank Miller, leading {{to the production of}} Sin City). In 2004, Allred, while promoting his comic book, The Golden Plates, announced that a screenplay by George Huang was near completion. In March 2006, it was announced that production on Sin City: A Dame to <b>Kill</b> <b>For</b> would be postponed. Allred announced at the 2006 WonderCon that production would likely commence on Madman the Movie in 2006. Huang is actually friends with Rodriguez, who advised him to pursue filmmaking as a career when Rodriguez landed a deal with Columbia Pictures where Huang was an employee.|$|E

25|$|Reports {{mentioned}} that female kidnapping victims were raped and able-bodied male kidnapping victims {{were forced to}} fight to the death with other hostages, similar to ancient Roman gladiators, where they were given knives, hammers, machetes and clubs to find recruits who were willing to <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> their lives. In the blood sport, the survivor was recruited as a hitman for Los Zetas; those who did not survive were buried in a clandestine gravesite. After the massacre, thousands of citizens from San Fernando fled to other parts of Mexico and to the US. The Mexican government responded by sending 650 soldiers to San Fernando and establishing a military base in the municipality. The troops took over the duties of the police force in the city and worked on social programs. In addition, a total of 82 Zeta members were arrested by 23 August 2011. In 2012 tranquility slowly returned to the city, along with the inhabitants who fled because of the violence.|$|E
25|$|In {{the issues}} of Green Lantern and Green Lantern Corps serving as preludes to the Blackest Night event, the Star Sapphires {{continue}} to make preparations for the predicted conflict. After undergoing treatment within a violet conversion crystal, Fatality emerges as a newly transformed Star Sapphire. Her first thoughts upon being released are to seek out John Stewart (a Green Lantern she'd been trying to <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> causing the destruction of her home planet). Upon finding him, however, she saves him from Agent Orange's attacking Orange Lantern constructs, demonstrating that {{they are unable to}} absorb constructs made from violet light. She admits that revenge is no longer her goal, and that she has other plans. In the following issue, she reveals that she's attracted to Stewart, may have always been, and the Star Sapphire has given her the ability to finally absolve herself of her survivor's guilt. After Fatality's successful conversion, Miri and Queen Aga'po observe that Kryb appears to be crying inside of her crystal (seemingly distraught over being separated from the children she kept imprisoned on her back). Queen Aga'po remarks that it is a sign the treatment is working.|$|E
25|$|Bears {{are said}} by a source to be {{generally}} afraid of tigers, and changed their path after coming across tiger trails; however, this is disputed. In the winters of 1970–1973, Yudakov and Nikolaev recorded two cases of bears showing {{no fear of}} tigers and another case of a brown bear changing path upon crossing tiger tracks. Other researchers have observed bears following tiger tracks to scavenge tiger kills and to potentially prey on tigers. Despite the threat of predation, some brown bears actually benefit from the presence of tigers by appropriating tiger kills that the bears {{may not be able}} to successfully hunt themselves. Brown bears generally prefer to contest the much smaller female tigers. During telemetry research in the Sikhote-Alin protected area, 44 direct confrontations between bears and tigers were observed, in which bears in general were killed in 22 cases, and tigers in 12 cases. There are reports of brown bears specifically targeting Amur leopards and tigers to abstract their prey. In the Sikhote-Alin reserve, 35% of tiger kills were stolen by bears, with tigers either departing entirely or leaving part of the <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> the bear. Some studies show that bears frequently track down tigers to usurp their kills, with occasional fatal outcomes for the tiger. A report from 1973 describes twelve known cases of brown bears killing tigers, including adult males; in all cases the tigers were subsequently eaten by the bears.|$|E

This {{made him one of}} the very few well-known players in any professional sport to endorse a sneaker not from Nike, Reebok, Adidas, or other high-visibility retail brands. As Olajuwon declared: [...] "How can a poor working mother with three boys buy Nikes or Reeboks that cost $120?...She can't. So kids steal these shoes from stores and from other kids.

David Hedison returned to play Felix Leiter, sixteen years after playing the character in Live and Let Die. Hedison {{did not expect to}} return to the role, saying [...] "I was sure that [...] would be my first – and last" [...] and Glen was reluctant to cast the 61-year-old actor, since the role included a scene parachuting. Hedison was the only actor to play Leiter twice, until Jeffrey Wright appeared in both Casino Royale and Quantum of Solace.|$|E
500|$|After Argento had {{experimented with}} pure supernatural horror with 1977's Suspiria and 1980's Inferno, Tenebrae {{represented}} the filmmaker's {{return to the}} giallo horror subgenre, which he had helped popularize in the 1970s. Argento {{was inspired by a}} series of incidents which saw an obsessed fan telephone the director to criticize him for the damaging psychological effects of his previous work. The telephone calls culminated in death threats towards Argento, who channelled the experience into the writing of Tenebrae. The director also wanted to explore the senselessness of killings he had witnessed and heard about while staying in Los Angeles in 1980, and his feeling at the time that true horror came from those who wanted [...] "to <b>kill</b> <b>for</b> nothing".|$|E

500|$|There is some dispute {{regarding}} who exactly {{shot down}} his fighter.

[...] Lt Wilbur Jarvis, No. 2 in the flight led by Doyle received a Damaged credit (not a <b>kill)</b> <b>for</b> Oesau's aircraft. Doyle noted bullet damage in the cockpit area and his gun camera footage showed that it was Oesau's Green 13.

Luke Lewis of NME wrote a mixed review of the song, stating, [...] "It feels less authentic, especially on ‘Dancefloor Queen’, a misfiring collaboration with Diplo that features the least convincing patois this side of a George Lamb radio show." ...|$|E
500|$|Although raised Catholic, Moreno González {{became a}} Jehovah's Witness {{during his time}} in the United States. In Apatzingán, Moreno González preached to the poor and always carried a bible with him.

When Carlos Rosales Mendoza was arrested in 2004, Moreno González ascended to the apex of La Familia Michoacana, a drug trafficking organization based in western Mexico, along with José de Jesús Méndez Vargas. In 2006, La Familia Michoacana broke relations with the Gulf Cartel and Los Zetas, and Moreno González heralded the organization's independence when several of his gunmen tossed five human heads on a discothèque dance floor in Uruapan.
