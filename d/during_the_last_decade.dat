5|$|Argentina {{is highly}} {{dependent}} on water supplies originating outside its borders, making it highly vulnerable to changes in water supply due to climate change. Droughts are frequent and devastating. Several years of droughts <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> have severely affected agricultural production and reduced economic growth. A drought in 2009 was the worst drought in more than 50 years. Many cattle died of hunger, and huge swaths of soy, corn and wheat fields were affected. It was estimated that the country lost more than US$5billion from the drought. A drought in 2011 affected farming of soy and corn, causing losses of US$2.5billion.|$|E

The last mine was abandoned in 1907, but panning for gold is still allowed {{in many areas}} of the forest, and in most circumstances no permit is required. After the end of the mining era, numerous camps were established by the Civilian Conservation Corps to help combat unemployment during the Great Depression of the 1930s. The camps housed groups of unemployed men who were paid by the federal government to build roads, hiking trails, and campgrounds for future travelers to the Yellowstone region. Visitation to national forests like Shoshone increased dramatically after World War II with the advent of better roads and accessibility to the region.|$|E
5|$|Although not {{as active}} in routine business, Johnson still took an {{interest}} in political events. For example, he spearheaded the efforts of the booksellers of London and Westminster to appeal a new copyright law in 1808. Moreover, although Johnson did not publish controversial political works after his imprisonment, he still undertook important publishing ventures. For example, he administered the publication of a forty-five volume work entitled The British Essayists, edited by Alexander Chalmers; the complete works of Samuel Johnson; and a ten-volume set of Shakespeare. Johnson published in more congers <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>last</b> <b>decade</b> of his life than at any other time. He also occasionally published important new authors, such as the political economist Thomas Malthus, whose Essay on the Principle of Population (1798) sparked a long debate between idealists and pragmatists. His emphasis on educational books continued or even increased as his interest in publishing contentious political works diminished. He also continued to support his friends, as with Godwin, who needed financial rescue after his play, Faulkener, cost him £800.|$|E
