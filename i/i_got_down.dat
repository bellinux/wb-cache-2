500|$|Martin, who {{finished}} second, was candid about the result, [...] "We did really well to finish second. I just don't {{think we were}} in [...] league today." [...] In the post-race press conference, Kenseth said of his result, [...] "We didn't qualify very good, but we were really happy with our car. When the race started, I didn't think we were quite {{as good as we}} were yesterday (in practice), but we were able to have really good pit stops." [...] Logano, who was involved in the biggest accident of the race, [...] "The biggest thing was, I was fine the whole time, [...] I'm not really sure what happened. The spotter was clearing me low. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> there, they checked up going into the corner and I got tagged from behind." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stevens {{contracted}} tuberculosis in 1969 and {{was close}} to death {{at the time of}} his admittance to the King Edward VII Hospital, Midhurst, West Sussex. He spent months recuperating in the hospital and a year of convalescence. During this time Stevens began to question aspects of his life and spirituality. He later said, [...] "to go from the show business environment and find you are in hospital, getting injections day in and day out, and people around you are dying, it certainly changes your perspective. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to thinking about myself. It seemed almost as if I had my eyes shut." ...|$|E
2500|$|Three {{weeks after}} the Eclipse, Golden Horn was the only three-year-old {{scheduled}} to contest the 55th running of the King George VI and Queen Elizabeth Stakes over {{one and a half}} miles at Ascot Racecourse. On the eve of the race, Gosden indicated that colt had made further progress, saying [...] "Golden Horn's been fine since the Eclipse and even progressed physically - he's filled out. We always thought that he was a good, proper horse, but he just seems that much more streetwise - harder and tougher now." [...] Heavy rain on the day before the race softened the ground and led to the withdrawal of the only French challenger Flintshire. After walking the course {{on the morning of the}} race, Gosden withdrew Golden Horn, saying [...] "It is very frustrating... The ground in the straight would be no problem - it's just the old track. It rides deep, deep down there and holding. If it was all on the new track I wouldn't hesitate on running, but it is not. Once <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to Swinley Bottom the stick went in 12 inches and made a pop sound as it came out... He can go on good to soft no problem. He can probably go on genuine soft, but I don't want to involve him in a sticky, holding ground". In Golden Horn's absence the race was won by Postponed.|$|E

60|$|MARGARET. That boy at {{the farm}} did it. He kept calling Snubs after me, but <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>down</b> and {{kicked him in the}} stomach. He is rather a jolly boy.|$|R
6000|$|... "The fact is, {{we began}} in fun, but when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>down</b> <b>I</b> couldn't help {{pounding}} him. Sorry I hurt you, old fellow," [...] explained Dan, looking rather ashamed of himself.|$|R
2500|$|... “One day Colonel Cody {{sent for}} me to come to his private office. [...] Wondering what he would want of me, I knocked at his door. [...] He invited me in, remarking, ‘Sit down, Standing Bear. [...] I have sent for you because I want you to tell you {{something}} of importance. [...] The Big Chief of this country, the King of England, has promised to attend a performance of our show. [...] Now I want you to go back to your people, call them all together, and tell them all about it. [...] Tell them {{to be very careful about}} their clothes; to see that they are perfectly clean and neat for that particular performance. [...] If anything needs repairs, tell them to attend to it at once. [...] We must please the King at this performance. [...] Rehearse your Indians well so they will do their best for me. [...] If the King likes our show, it will please the people of this country. [...] I have observed your own costume. [...] It is very fine, and when the King attends the show, I want you to do an Indian dance in front of his box. [...] Will you do this for me?” [...] “Everything worked splendidly. [...] When it came time for the Indians to come in with their village in the center of the arena, we started the dance in which I was to appear before the King of England. [...] I had a beautiful lance, and as the dance proceeded I worked over toward the King’s box. [...] There I shook the lance in his face and danced my very prettiest, you may be sure. [...] The King had been very dignified thus far, and had not even smiled. [...] But when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to doing my fancy steps and gave a few Sioux yells, he had to smile in spite of himself. [...] I saw that I had made a hit with him and was very happy. After the show, Buffalo Bill brought the King and his party around the inside of the arena. [...] In front of him walked a big man who seemed to keep his eyes roving about all the while. [...] I think he must have been the King’s personal bodyguard. [...] Buffalo Bill brought the King over to me and we were introduced. [...] We shook hands, although neither of us said a word. [...] But I had the honor of being introduced to King Edward VII, the monarch of Great Britain.” ...|$|E
60|$|Then <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down,</b> on {{my hands}} and knees and went on another {{exploring}} expedition.|$|E
60|$|After this feat, <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> rapidly on deck, and {{received}} {{something like a}} compliment from Max the Dutchman.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> him <b>down</b> and smuggled {{him into}} our barn, and he stayed there {{until it was}} dark and the Strong girls had gone home. Emmeline began to rage at Prissy the moment they were outside my door.|$|R
6000|$|... "'In the meantime,' said Mr. Brownsill, 'I'll have {{to charge}} {{you for the}} book; and, {{deducting}} your pay for {{three quarters of a}} day, you now owe me seventy-five cents. I don't suppose there's any use talking about the fines <b>I</b> have <b>got</b> <b>down</b> against you?' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to plugging, and for {{the first}} time, not for my home team. I wanted Philadelphia to win, because Burt was on the team. With Old Well-Well sitting there so rigid in his seat, so obsessed by the playing of the lad, I turned traitor to New York.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if it was}} a sack! And after all, {{the young}} man was gone when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> int' the street," [...] {{concluded}} 'Manda Grier solemnly.|$|E
60|$|In {{the morning}} he was up early, by six o'clock downstairs and {{attending}} to the car. When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> I found him very busy, and very quiet.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] he said, [...] "I {{guess if}} <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> and edged {{out to the}} off side you might pass me. The trail's a little wider here." ...|$|E
5000|$|.....The {{first run}} in the final (the false start) {{definitely}} took {{a lot out of}} me because <b>I</b> <b>got</b> halfway <b>down</b> the back straight the second time and my legs were burning bad. I could never have dreamed I'd come away with a Silver medal in my first World Cup though." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Wal, ye see, boys, ye know I {{was born}} down to Newport,--there where it's all ships and shipping, and sich. My old mother she kep' a boardin'-house for sailors down there. Wal, ye see, I rolled and tumbled {{round the world}} pretty consid'able afore <b>I</b> <b>got</b> settled <b>down</b> here in Oldtown.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you, miss; {{not that}} one," [...] said Rufus. [...] "You see, I'm {{long in the}} legs, and if <b>I</b> once <b>got</b> <b>down</b> as low as that, I reckon I should have to restore the balance by putting my {{feet up on the}} grate; and that's not manners in Great Britain--and quite right too." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No sir, it is impossible. Before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> the stair, I'd {{have seen}} {{anyone in the}} passage. Besides, the door never opened, or I would have heard it." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> {{slowly and}} painfully, for my limbs were stiff and my feet very sore. He smiled darkly at my words and my sudden faltering; but I {{affected}} not to see.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{was called}} in by the simple process {{of the old man}} beckoning to me with his {{forefinger}} over the gate of his house as I happened to be driving past. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down,</b> of course.|$|E
5000|$|Dave Anderson {{said he saw}} Liston in Las Vegas in 1967 {{and asked}} him what happened. [...] "It wasn't that hard a punch, but it {{partially}} caught me off balance and when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> knocked <b>down,</b> <b>I</b> <b>got</b> mixed up because the referee never gave me a count," [...] Liston said. [...] "I was listening for a count. That's {{the first thing you}} do, but I never heard a count because Clay never went to a neutral corner." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm afraid <b>I</b> haven't <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to the {{primitive}} diet yet," [...] he sighed, {{as he sat}} back. [...] "The tinned goods on the Rattler, now I could make a hearty meal off of them, but this muck----" [...] He took a half-pound strip of broiled shark and flung it to the dog. [...] "I suppose I'll come to it if you don't surrender pretty soon." ...|$|R
60|$|To Holmes I wrote {{showing how}} rapidly and surely <b>I</b> had <b>got</b> <b>down</b> {{to the roots}} of the matter. In reply I had a {{telegram}} asking for a description of Dr. Shlessinger's left ear. Holmes's ideas of humour are strange and occasionally offensive, so I took no notice of his ill-timed jest--indeed, I had already reached Montpellier in my pursuit of the maid, Marie, before his message came.|$|R
6000|$|... "But {{there the}} stuff is for the taking. They don't know about it. Nobody knows about it. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to the damned place in a canoe alone. The boys wouldn't come. I pretended to be botanising." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{was only}} a stone in her shoe. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> and pulled it out a hundred yards back. I can manage very well, thank you. I shall be in Bath by daylight. Will you now return, please?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> from my mule, and was {{conducted}} at Cosimo's bidding {{to one of the}} dungeons under the Palace, where I was left with the announcement that I must present myself to-morrow before the Tribunal of the Ruota.|$|E
6000|$|... "Watch the animals?" [...] screamed Reddy, in a rage; [...] "you go an' watch 'em awhile {{instead of}} eatin' doughnuts, an' {{see how you}} like it. Mr. Stubbs's brother picked {{a hole in the}} bag so my cat got out, an' she jumped on the calf, an' he tore 'round awful till he let the hen an' Mrs. Simpson's cat loose, an' <b>I</b> <b>got</b> knocked <b>down</b> an' scratched, an' the whole show's broke up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "So I cached my valise at {{the station}} and I wallered out there through the dust--it was June and a dry spell and hot. Judas priest! I thought I'd sweat my wad into pulp before <b>I</b> <b>got</b> there--me just <b>down</b> from the high country! On the way <b>I</b> <b>got</b> to wonderin' about Nancy. 'Is she alive, I wonder?' ...|$|R
3000|$|I {{drew out}} of my pocket the “report” I had signed. So she was living in the square de l’Alboni.

60|$|Just {{now with}} the rose in her brown cheeks, her hair flying, her eyes with grave instead of mocking light, she seemed only prettier than usual. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> ostensibly to tighten the saddle girths on her horse. But I lingered over the task.|$|E
60|$|The coach {{stopped for}} dinner; {{and some of}} our {{passengers}} left us, the excitable man with the handbills among the number. <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down,</b> and stood on the doorstep of the inn, pretending to be looking about me, but in reality watching the movements of the runner.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>got</b> <b>down</b> {{stairs in}} the morning the parlor was shut up, and the watchers was gone. There warn't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe. I watched their faces to see if {{anything}} had been happening, but I couldn't tell.|$|E
60|$|And here's {{the strange}} part of it. <b>I</b> had hardly <b>got</b> <b>down</b> {{to the office}} after breakfast when <b>I</b> <b>got</b> a wire {{to tell me that}} my {{mother-in-law}} had broken her arm in Cincinnati. Strange, wasn't it? No, not at half-past two during that night--that's the inexplicable part of it. She had broken it at half-past eleven the morning before. But you notice it was half-past in each case. That's the queer way these things go.|$|R

60|$|Mr. Enderton's {{condition}} now became pitiable, for our {{rapid speed}} and the bumping over rough {{places in the}} road seemed almost to deprive him of his wits, notwithstanding my assurance that stage-coaches were generally driven at a rapid rate down long inclines. In a short time, however, we reached a level spot in the road, and the team was drawn up and stopped. Mr. Enderton popped out in a moment, and <b>I</b> also <b>got</b> <b>down</b> to {{have a talk with}} the driver.|$|R
