He told Matthews: My feeling about that - first of all, it's been kind of a bit overblown.

I greatly respect my son's service and {{all of the people who}} are serving. At the same time, I have not commented, even to many of my friends, about the operational side. That's personal to me in terms of my feelings about it. And it was not a casual comment.

40|$|ABSTRACT OF THE THESIS"Love Your Curves and all Your Edges"byTesiana ElieMaster of Fine Arts in Theatre and Dance (Acting) University of California, San Diego, 2015 Professor Gregory Wallace, Chair	During {{this year}} I've formed many special relationships. The most {{intimate}} was being reintroduced to my skin and voice. I {{had the privilege}} to learn about Sarah Bartman. A woman whose beauty, women today {{are still trying to}} replicate. By learning this woman I had the honor in learning about myself. Sarah was seen by all and heard to by none and sometimes as an actor <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way.</b> But the beauty of Sarah was, she taught me how to use my voice when I felt the most hopeless. I {{had to learn how to}} be heard, while being proud of who I am. I know there is power in silence, but what I learned is that there is more power in being vulnerable. 	 Nina Simone said, "It's an artist's duty to reflect the times in which we live. " Being here gave me the permission to call myself that. An artist. Where I come from names have power. So, if we as artist have power in our tongues, then can't I also change the meaning of beauty? Can I be a reflection of the most powerful, diligent, and divine women I know, and not have a European standard looking back? What I've learned is that we have the authority to strip silent fears and public struggles of their bondage. So I'm not interested in the world's standards I have my own. I would say this year was for reinforcing the curve of my hips and edge of my tongue...|$|E

But instead, all that I have learned in these 13 years allows me to compose something much more intricate. To be perfectly honest, I find it so hard to believe that songs from 13 years ago are loved this much. Keeping these feelings in mind, I hope to continue composing songs which are powerful, and yet intricate...I hope that the extras like this bonus CD will help expand the world of Chrono Trigger, especially since we did a live recording. I hope there's another opportunity to release an album of this sort one day.|$|R
5000|$|The {{experience}} of invidia, as Robert A. Kaster notes, is invariably an unpleasant one, whether feeling invidia or finding oneself its object. Invidia {{at the thought}} of another's good may be merely begrudging, Kaster observes, or begrudging and covetous at the same time: [...] "I can feel dolor sorrow, heartache" [...] at seeing your good, just because it is your good, period, or <b>I</b> can <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> because the good is yours and not mine." [...] Such invidia is morally indefensible: compare the Aesop fable [...] "The Dog in the Manger". But by far the most common usage in Latin of invidia occurs in contexts where the sense of justice has been offended, and pain is experienced at the sight of undeserved wealth, prestige or authority, exercised without shame (pudor); this is the close parallel with Greek [...] (νέμεσις) ...|$|R

In 2014, Raonic explained: [...] "I'm the son of two engineers, so everything is a numbers and calculation game." [...] In 2016, he added: [...] "I am very systematic in how [...] need to go about things to bring out the best tennis for myself, and maybe that comes off as mechanical and robotic and those kind of things, but I don't know if I'd ever change <b>that</b> because <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> <b>that's</b> the <b>way</b> <b>I</b> get the best out of myself when it comes to my tennis." ...|$|R

Kevin Mullaney, who directed Swarm of Spoilers, stated: [...] "I'm somebody who's very sensitive about spoilers, so I {{wanted to make sure}} it was very clear from the title," [...] though he went on to say, [...] "There's actually this theory about spoilers that we think that they hurt the enjoyment of shows, and <b>I</b> definitely <b>feel</b> <b>that</b> <b>way</b> sometimes, but <b>I</b> think there's been studies that show the other side: that when we know the ending of a story that we haven't read before, it actually enhances the story, so I don't know if it would actually hurt anyone to come see it Swarm of Spoilers." [...] The final production included 45 of the series' characters, and was played by an 18-person ensemble.|$|R

Neal Gabler wrote in the New York Times that Harvard students were [...] "superachivers", even considering the effects of financial aid. They were [...] "likely to be wealthy, well-appointed young people groomed and professionalized at an early age precisely so they would impress admissions officers."
