40|$|Addressing the US Congress on February 5 th 2003 Commissioner Fischler set out {{the link}} between the EU's reform of the CAP and the EU's {{approach}} to the WTO agreement on agriculture. He claimed that EU policy has been 'gradually but consistently changing' and that there has been 'a clear move away from the most trade- and production-distorting measures of support'. He maintained that the EU was pursuing a policy of 'support of our farmers while further reducing trade distortion and production distortion'. He pointed out that the EU budget would only increase 1 % per annum between 2006 and 2013, despite a 50 % {{increase in the number of}} farmers to be assisted as a result of enlargement, and that the most important element of reform was 'a total <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> from production' and an increased emphasis on rural development. Against this background of CAP reform Commissioner Fischler maintained that EU proposals in the WTO 'take full account of the interests of the most important group of countries in the negotiations, the developing countries' He maintained that EU proposals did this by proposing increased access for developing country products and additional flexibility for developing countries in implementing their commitments. He also forcefully argued for the accommodation of non-trade concerns in any agricultural agreement, maintaining that this was not simply a ruse to hide increased farm expenditures. Having criticised US proposals, Commissioner Fischler closed by emphasising that both the USA and the EU will want to 'continue to support farmers and rural areas for the foreseeable future' and that therefore it was important to find common ground on this issue. Comment: Commissioner Fischler's statement on the move towards 'a total <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> from production' stands in distinct contrast to the assurances given to EU agriculture ministers only a few days before that the process of de-coupling support will be limited where 'there is a genuine risk of production dropping to unacceptable levels'. Clearly when talking to a domestic audience the Commissioner places a somewhat different emphasis on the overall trajectory of CAP reform. The emphasis on finding common ground, given a continued desire of the EU and USA to support farmers and rural areas, provides some indication of where a consensus could lie in their approaches to the WTO agricultural negotiations.

40|$|The September World Bank paper 'Cancun: Crisis or Catharsis' {{sets out}} the {{importance}} of a successful conclusion to the Doha Development Round to developing countries, and reviews: the coalitions which formed in Cancun around agricultural issues; the debate on the 'Singapore issues' and the positions adopted; and the implications of the failure of Cancun. In this latter regard it highlights: how Cancun illustrated that 'realising the promise of trade reforms through reciprocal bargaining is a major challenge', with successful negotiations requiring an agenda that is seen to be relevant to the needs and objectives of all parties; how 'developing countries are playing an ever more pro-active role in the WTO', with the larger developing countries demonstrating that they can put together and sustain negotiating alliances, even though national interests may differ; how 'the reciprocity dynamics of the WTO negotiating process requires that developing countries offer 'enough' to OECD countries to induce them to take on the interests that benefit from trade protection'; within developing countries the main thing they have to offer is greater market opening; how 'there is significant scope to harness the traditional WTO reciprocity dynamics to move forward on market access in goods and services; how 'research and capacity-building made a difference in enhancing the knowledge of the issues on the table and informing positions'; how 'Cancun suggests that much more work is needed to integrate development considerations into the trade policy process and to mobilise resources for trade related investments and reforms'; how Cancun raises 'questions regarding the governance and procedures of the WTO'. In terms of the way forward the paper suggests a removal of investment and competition policy from the negotiating table, since this would enable a focus on issues which matter more to developing countries, namely 'removing trade-distorting policies that hurt the poor disproportionately'. However the quid pro quo for this would need to be that governments in the South, particularly middle-income countries, accept the need to lower trade barriers. Comment: The EU maintains that it is committed to implementing agricultural policy changes which reduce trade distortions if not wholly eliminate them (the shift from price support to <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> payments). However there are those in the developing world who believe that these policy changes simply improve the efficiency of trade distortions. The levels of both production and trade that are being generated are much higher than would be the case at the prices ruling within the EU {{in the absence of the}} <b>direct</b> <b>aid</b> payments being made from the EU budget. Unless this basic divergence of views is reconciled it is difficult to see how the debate on removing trade-distorting policies in the agricultural sector can be taken forward. In addition the priority accorded to removing trade-distorting policies would appear to be a double-edged sword for ACP countries. For example, removing trade distortions in the sugar sector (through the measures currently being discussed within the EU) will lead to large revenue losses for ACP exporters (equivalent to about € 303 million under one scenario explored in the recent Commission staff working paper), with no guarantee that they will benefit from any consequent improvement in the world market price.

40|$|The 42 nd Meeting of the Research Centre for Appraisal and Land Economics (Ce. S. E. T.) focused its {{attention}} on land markets, {{given that the}} new Common Agricultural Policy, which has proposed strong reforms that have been much discussed, has arrived at an advanced stage of definition. The land market theme, although little contemplated in economic evaluations of agricultural policies, is an essential topic for the understanding of development processes, especially after the economic crisis linked to real estate appraisal. The hypotheses of totally <b>decoupling</b> <b>direct</b> <b>aid,</b> adopting undifferentiated payments per hectare, and introducing a bonus for "greening", as contemplated in the CAP reform proposal, could significantly modify the present equilibrium in terms of competitiveness between crops and, more in general, {{the structure of the}} sector itself. Following an in-depth analysis of the specific elements of the extant CAP reform and those linked to other communautaire measures, such as the liberalization of planting rights for vineyards and further elements of a structural nature where other economic and social activities are competing for land use, it is possible to appreciate the tensions in the market as regards current and future rural funds. The multidisciplinary perspective that characterized the meeting held in Palermo, allowed us to compare and integrate different theoretical and operational approaches, while examining in detail all the aspects dealt with, both from an appraisal and from a territorial economy standpoint. The most important Italian researchers in estimates and legal affairs and the main actors on the territory, like the Natural Resources Agency, the National Institute of Agricultural Economics and a delegate of the Agronomy and Forestry Doctors' Order, attended the meeting. Furthermore the contribution of Professor Giovanni La Via, member of the European Parliament should be emphasized; he is an academic of the appraisal of farmland and a BUDG rapporteur of the European Parliament, who defined the dynamics of land values {{in the light of the}} most updated forecasts of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy. The interesting researches presented during the meeting were organized, as a consequence of the multidisciplinary nature of the meeting, in three parallel sessions, with the aim of promoting a comparison between the various theoretical and operational approaches: "The agricultural policy instruments and their effects on land values"; "The dynamics and the appraisal of land property values"; "The evaluation of public assets in rural areas". During the conference many research ideas were put forward, there was a mutual enrichment of knowledge while issues to be developed emerged. It is the hope of the Centre that the debate and the dialogue between all the parties involved will continue. As the principle of multidisciplinary debate is innate in Ce. S. E. T., it undertakes to promote opportunities for study and discussion that favour this process. Finally, I wish to express, also in the names of the entire Ce. S. E. T. scientific committee, sincere gratitude towards Professor Maria Crescimanno and all the organizers for the quality of the event, for welcoming everyone and, above all, for the scientific level of the contributions formalized through the ISI certification process of the proceedings.

40|$|The 2003 Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) reform radically {{changes the}} way the European Union (EU) {{supports}} its agricultural sector by <b>decoupling</b> <b>direct</b> payments. Production is no longer required to get the payment attached to Single Farm Payment (SFP) entitlements. However, the new scheme maintains a specific link between payments and hectares; in addition, SFP entitlements can be exchanged among farmers. These features question the way SFP entitlements should be regarded, hence modelled, i. e., as lump-sum transfers, area payments or… something else. We develop a microeconomic analytical framework which shows that the answer crucially depends on {{the total number of}} entitlements which are initially made available relative to the number of hectares, more specifically the number of cultivated hectares in a zero support regime, the number of cultivated hectares in a policy support regime trough per-hectare <b>direct</b> <b>aids,</b> and the number of cultivated or idled hectares in a policy regime where support is granted through <b>direct</b> <b>aids</b> per hectare and production is not required.

40|$|A {{stochastic}} {{dynamic programming}} model {{is used to}} compare the farmland investment impact of a fully <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> payment and a standard price subsidy. The direct payment induces the farmer to invest because it lowers the farm’s debt to asset ratio, which in turn reduces the probability of bankruptcy. The value of the real option to defer the investment decision is lower with a lower risk of bankruptcy, and thus the direct payment results in a higher probability of immediate investment. Simulation results demonstrate that for a farm facing moderate revenue and land price variability, the impact of a <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> payment on farm investment is nearly as large as the investment impact of an equal-sized price subsidy. These results suggest that direct payments, such as those associated with U. S. production flexibility contracts, should be carefully scrutinized in on-going multilateral trade negotiations.

40|$|Abstract Among the {{numerous}} non-point sources of diffuse water pollution with nitrogen, agriculture is counted {{one of the}} main sources. The agricultural policies of the Agenda 2000 and a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> payments for farmers from their production decisions are exemplarily evaluated as nitrogen reduction measures using the Regional Agricultural and Environmental Information System RAUMIS. The results show that until the target year 2010 the risk of diffuse pollution of water bodies with nitrogen is a regional problem in Germany. These problems are neither mitigated by the policies of Agenda 2000 nor by a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> payments from production decisions of farmers. While total nitrogen surplus reduces considerably after a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> payments due to decreases of land-use the nitrogen surplus on the remaining cultivated area increases resulting from structural changes. Granting the same amount of direct payments to farmers in both policy alternatives the agricultural sector income would be higher after a <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> payments opposed to the Agenda 2000 resulting from a more efficient allocation of inputs...|$|R

A literature review reveals that various simulation models uniformly project a decline of the cereal and silage maize acreage as well as ruminant production in the EU- 15 in the course of <b>decoupling</b> of <b>direct</b> payments. In contrast, model results are mixed with respect to the direction of the decoupling effect on oilseed and pasture as well as voluntary set aside area. The model type is not found to have a systematic effect on model results. It is rather the assumptions about the effects of direct payments on production which differ widely and drive model results to a large extent. A model analysis which is based on the partial agricultural sector model ESIM- 2005 highlights the importance of the level of pasture acreage allocation elasticities in the determination of decoupling effects on the distribution of Grandes Cultures and fodder & pasture area. <b>decoupling,</b> <b>direct</b> payments, land allocation, partial equilibrium agricultural sector models, Agricultural and Food Policy, Land Economics/Use,...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} how <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> payments, paid to farm operators based on historical yields and base acreage, may lead to production distortions by altering a farmer's access to credit or enabling the farmer to receive more favorable credit terms. The authors estimate the impact of <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> payments under the 2002 Farm Bill on the credit terms of farm operators, specifically the interest rate on short-term operating loans. If farm operators are able to obtain more favorable credit terms and reduce their operating cost, then this offers an additional mechanism through which decoupled payments may distort current production. Design/methodology/approach – The authors estimate the impact of <b>decoupled</b> <b>direct</b> payments on the interest rate on short-term operating loans. In the analysis, the authors control for farm financial characteristics, farm operator characteristics, and other factors. Data from the Agricultural Resource Management Survey for the years 2005 - 2007, are used in the weighted regression analysis. Jackknifed standard errors are also computed. Findings – As the proportion of base acres to total operated acres increases it is found that interest rates decline by a small but statistically significant amount. This implies that direct payments lead to lower operating costs through better credit terms. Research limitations/implications – Lower operating costs may in turn allow some farmers to expand production or produce on land that would otherwise be unprofitable to operate and hence left idle. Ultimately, this distorts current production. However, the small magnitude of the authors' results suggests that the reduction in interest rates, though positive, may have limited distortionary impacts. Originality/value – The paper provides evidence that decoupled payments alter a farm operator's credit terms and hence could lead to current production distortions. The paper contributes to the growing body of research investigating the mechanisms by which decoupled payments have the potential to distort current production.
