In total, Brulé missed 39games with injuries in 2010–11, limiting him to 7goals and 2assists.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the advent}} of music downloads, only sales of {{physical}} formats—such as CD, vinyl and cassette tape—contributed towards positions on the UK music charts. The first chart to record sales of downloads was the UK Singles Downloads Chart, which was launched in September 2004 to list weekly sales of single downloads. Downloaded singles were growing considerably at this time, rising ten-fold {{in the first half}} of 2005 compared to the same period in 2004. As single downloads grew in popularity, so did album downloads – 1.8million albums were downloaded in 2005; a further 825,000 were downloaded during the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2006.|$|E

This achievement was {{due in part to the}} mainstream promotional efforts Modern Sounds had received from ABC prior to and following release. The album proved to be a crossover hit as well, as distributors claimed the record had been selling in pop, R and country music markets; at the time, often referred to as white and black markets during the period.|$|E
5|$|The Mongalla region {{suffered}} {{an outbreak of}} cerebrospinal meningitis (CSM) between 1918 and 1924, apparently introduced by Ugandan porters who had served in German East Africa during World War I. CSM caused high mortality for a six-year period as it spread from one family to another. A less devastating CSM epidemic started in 1926, causing 335 deaths in 1928, 446 in 1929 and 335 in the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1930 before rapidly dying out.|$|E

In {{the summer of}} 1936, following {{the outbreak of the}} Spanish Civil War, she deployed to the Atlantic to participate in non-intervention patrols off the Republican-held coast of Spain. Between August 1936 and May 1937, the ship conducted three patrols off Spain.

5|$|Because he {{reported}} late, Berg spent the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the {{season on the}} bench. In August, a series of injuries to catchers Ray Schalk, Harry McCurdy and Buck Crouse left the White Sox in need of somebody to play the position. Schalk, the White Sox player/manager, selected Berg, who did a fine job filling in. Schalk arranged for former Philadelphia Phillies catcher Frank Bruggy to meet the team at their next game, against the New York Yankees. Bruggy was so fat that pitcher Ted Lyons refused to pitch to him. When Schalk asked him whom he wanted to catch, Lyons selected Berg.|$|E
5|$|During the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1944, Cicero {{supplied}} the Germans with copies of documents {{taken from his}} employer's dispatch box or his safe. Photographs of top secret documents were generally handed over in Moyzisch's car, which was parked inconspicuously on an Ankara street. On one occasion, {{this led to a}} high-speed chase around Ankara as someone had taken an interest in the hand-over. Bazna, who had perhaps been tailed, escaped. Ultra, the British codebreaking system based at Bletchley Park routinely read German messages, coded by the Enigma machine. From that information, the codebreakers knew that there was an intelligence breach, but did not know that the source was the British Embassy in Turkey.|$|E
30|$|The {{labor market}} reform has also {{provided}} a chance to tackle the thorny problem of greater inclusion of women in economic and social life, to fight the persistence of discriminatory practices {{in the workplace and}} at the level of job protection. Consequently, even within the stringency of tight financial constraints, the reform also introduced specific provisions for women, whose participation to labor market is one of the lowest in Europe (see Additional file 1 : Figure S 4). These include experimental provisions, trying not only to make working life easier but also to strike a better balance between private life and working life. With the aim of supporting parenthood and of promoting a gender-balanced distribution of childcare within families and of harmonizing the Italian legislation to the European Directives and other countries’ provisions a mandatory paternal leave (sadly, very modest) has been introduced consisting of a compulsory day leave in the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>month</b> <b>of</b> the child’s life plus two optional days to be shared between parents. Vouchers meant to facilitate mothers’ work by easing their access to public and private childcare services have also been introduced. Finally, as already mentioned, a provision trying to prevent the practice of fake resignations, the so-called “dimissioni in bianco”, was also included in the law.|$|R

The following year, Eurostar saw an 11.5% fall in passenger numbers during the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 2009, attributed to the 2008 Channel Tunnel fire and the 2009 recession.|$|E
5|$|In March 1987, {{the main}} Libyan air base of Ouadi Doum was {{captured}} by Chadian forces. Although strongly defended by minefields, 5,000 soldiers, tanks, armored vehicles, and aircraft, the Libyans' base fell to a smaller Chadian attacking force led by Djamous equipped with trucks mounted with machine guns and antitank weapons. Observers estimated that, in the Chadian victories in the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> 1987, more than 3,000 Libyan soldiers had been killed, captured, or deserted. Large numbers of tanks, armored personnel carriers, artillery, fixed-wing aircraft, and helicopters were captured or destroyed. In some cases, Libya sent its own aircraft to bomb abandoned Libyan equipment to deny its use to the Chadians. It was reported that, in many cases, Libyan soldiers had been killed while fleeing to avoid battle. At Ouadi Doum, panicked Libyans had suffered high casualties running through their own minefields.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Imperial County {{businessmen}} {{hoped to}} promote {{the use of this}} road over the route from Phoenix to Los Angeles, to increase tourism. Eventually, US 80 did become the most used road into Southern California from the east, but by 1947, the Highway 80 Associated was formed to increase the traffic on the road, since the war and advertising by other cities had caused it to fall again. Four years later, US 80 was reported to be the most used transcontinental highway, and there was a 40 percent increase in the out-of-state cars that traveled through the state inspection station at Yuma during the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> that year. But in 1954, there were reports that traffic had decreased, because the road to Phoenix, Arizona from Lordsburg, New Mexico had improved.|$|E

In eight games for the Indians, Robertson had a record of 1–1 and a 12.21 ERA. In his final appearance in the major leagues, a July 21 game against the Chicago White Sox, Robertson was ejected after hitting Magglio Ordóñez with a pitch in the fifth inning.|$|E
5|$|The Octopus {{system was}} {{launched}} {{after three years}} of trials on 1 September 1997. Three million cards were issued within the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> the system's launch. The quick success of the system was compelled by the fact that MTR and KCR required all holders of Common Stored Value Tickets to replace their tickets with Octopus cards in three months or have their tickets made obsolete, which drove commuters to switch quickly. Another reason was the coin shortage in Hong Kong in 1997. With the transfer of Hong Kong away from British rule, there was a belief that the older Queen's Head coins in Hong Kong would rise in value, so many people hoarded these older coins and waited for their value to increase.|$|E
5|$|Apple {{unveiled}} the PowerBook100 on October 21, 1991, at the Comdex computer expo in Las Vegas, {{with two other}} models, the PowerBook 140 and PowerBook 170. The advertisement and the product were both successful. Apple projected US sales of more than 200,000 PowerBooks {{in the first year}}, with peak demand in the <b>first</b> <b>three</b> <b>months</b> <b>of</b> release. By January 1992, Apple had sold more than 100,000 PowerBooks, by which time they were in short supply. Apple soon solved the supply problems, and the proceeds from PowerBook sales reached $1billion in the first year after launch. Apple surpassed Toshiba and Compaq as the market leader in worldwide share of portable computer shipments. The PowerBook100, 140, and 170 contributed greatly to Apple's financial success in 1992. At the end of the financial year, Apple announced its highest figures yet, $7.1billion in revenues and an increase in global market share from 8% to 8.5%, the highest it had been in four years.|$|E
