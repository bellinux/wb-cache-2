5|$|Located near Alpha is Delta Antliae, {{a binary}} star, 430 ± 30 light-years distant from Earth. The primary is a blue-white main {{sequence}} star of spectral type B9.5V and magnitude 5.6, and the secondary is a yellow-white main sequence star of spectral type F9Ve and magnitude 9.6. Zeta Antliae {{is a wide}} optical double star. The brighter star—Zeta1 Antliae—is 410 ± 40 light-years distant and has a magnitude of 5.74, {{though it is a}} true binary star system composed of two white main sequence stars of magnitudes 6.20 and 7.01 that are separated by 8.042 arcseconds. The fainter star—Zeta2 Antliae—is 380 ± 20 light-years distant and of magnitude 5.9. Eta Antliae is another double composed of a yellow white star of spectral type F1V and magnitude 5.31, with a companion of magnitude 11.3. Theta Antliae is likewise double, most likely composed of an A-type main sequence star and a yellow giant. S Antliae is an <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> <b>system</b> that varies in apparent magnitude from 6.27 to 6.83 over a period of 15.6 hours. The system is classed as a W Ursae Majoris variable—the primary is hotter than the secondary and the drop in magnitude is caused by the latter passing in front of the former. Calculating the properties of the component stars from the orbital period indicates that the primary star has a mass 1.94 times and a diameter 2.026 times that of the Sun, and the secondary has a mass 0.76 times and a diameter 1.322 times that of the Sun. The two stars have similar luminosity and spectral type as they have a common envelope and share stellar material. The system is thought to be around 5–6 billion years old. The two stars will eventually merge to form a single fast-spinning star.|$|E

All that has been done without exploiting fully the CGAformalism, hence, the main purpose of the present paper is to exploit profoundly the CGA-equations in order to investigate, among other things, CGA-spin-orbit coupling precession and application of CGA to Large-Scale Structures with the aim of resolving the problem of galactic rotation curves...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: It {{is usually}} {{known that the}} line of apsides of <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> <b>systems</b> {{precesses}} due to general relativistic effects and classical (Newtonian) tidal and rotational deformations of the stars, whose rotation axes are assumed normal to the orbital plane. For almost all binaries, the expected theoretical and observed apsidal motion rates are in agreement. However, some systems –V 541 Cygni, V 1143 Cygni, V 459 Cassiopeia and AS Camelopardalis – have broken this agreement and resisted explanation for a long time. In this study, we are exclusively dealt with V 541 Cygni. We present very tentative theoretical {{evidence in support of}} the hypothesis that the retrograde spin-orbit coupling of system causes orbital plane precession in the direction opposite to the relativistic apsidal motion when the spin angular momentum vector is not aligned with the orbital angular momentum vector, thereby reconciling the theoretical and observational results...|$|R

40|$|With {{observations}} of the EP Cru system, we continue our series of measurements of spin-orbit angles in <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> <b>systems,</b> the BANANA project (Binaries Are Not Always Neatly Aligned). We find a close alignment between the sky projections of the rotational and orbital angular momentum vectors for both stars (beta_p = - 1. 8 +- 1. 6 deg and |beta_s|< 17 deg). We also derive precise absolute dimensions and stellar ages for this system. The EP Cru and DI Her systems provide an interesting comparison: they have similar stellar types and orbital properties, but DI Her is younger and has major spin-orbit misalignments, raising {{the question of whether}} EP Cru also had a large misalignment at an earlier phase of evolution. We show that tidal dissipation is an unlikely explanation for the good alignment observed today, because realignment happens on the same timescale as spin-orbit synchronization, and the stars in EP Cru are far from syncrhonization (they are spinning 9 times too quickly). Therefore it seems that some binaries form with aligned axes, while other superficially similar binaries are formed with misaligned axes. Comment: ApJ accepted, 10 pages, 7 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{detection}} of terrestrial-sized extrasolar planets {{from the ground}} has been thought to be virtually impossible due to atmospheric scintillation limits. However, we show {{that this is not}} the case especially selected (but nevertheless main sequence) <b>stars,</b> namely small <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binaries.</b> For the smallest of these systems, CM Draconis, several months to a few years of photometric observations with 1 -m-class telescopes will be sufficient to detect the transits of any short-period planets of sizes > or = 1. 5 Earth radii (RE), using cross-correlation analysis with moderately good photometry. Somewhat larger telescopes will be needed to extend this detectability to terrestrial planets in larger <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binary</b> systems. (We arbitrarily define "terrestrial planets" herein as those whose disc areas are closer to that of Earth's than Neptune's i. e., less than about 2. 78 RE.) As a "spin-off" of such observations, we will also be able to detect the presence of Jovian-mass planets without transits using the timing of the eclipse minima. Eclipse minima will drift in time as the binary system is offset by a sufficiently massive planet (i. e., one Jupiter mass) about the binary/giant-planet barycenter, causing a periodic variation in the light travel time to the observer. We present here an outline of present observations taking place at the University of California Lick Observatory using the Crossley 0. 9 -m telescope in collaboration with other observatories (in South Korea, Crete, France, Canary Islands, and New York) to detect or constrain the existence of terrestrial planets around main sequence <b>eclipsing</b> <b>binary</b> <b>star</b> <b>systems,</b> starting with CM Draconis.

The spectral characteristics of this event indicate Rayleigh scattering due to a high column density of neutral hydrogen {{in the line of}} sight to the hot white dwarf. We model this observation in the framework of an accretion wake trailing the white dwarf. This interpretation is analogous to comparable models for ζ Aur systems and X-ray binaries.
