5|$|After {{saying goodbye}} to {{everyone}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> Diane returns {{to the office and}} accidentally hits Sam's nose when she opens the door. Because of that, she is convinced that Sam was coming out of the office to say something to her. They argue, admit their feelings for each other, and come into the terms that their relationship with Derek is nothing compared to their potential relationship together. Sam and Diane embrace, but then Diane rejects his advances, i.e. attempts to kiss her. They insult each other and, at the end, kiss passionately.|$|E
5|$|At 17:30, {{three hours}} into the war, the twelfth and final {{infantry}} wave crossed, bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32,000 men (around 6,400 in each bridgehead). By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks. The magnitude of Israeli losses stemmed from their insistence to reach their comrades <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Lev Line, and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers.|$|E
5|$|David Elazar {{continued}} to instruct Gonen to evacuate soldiers from strongpoints {{which were not}} yet surrounded, even though by October 7 most Israeli defences were encircled. Egyptian losses up to the morning of October 7 were only 280 killed and 20 tanks destroyed. Israeli losses were far heavier; the brigade <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Lev Line was completely surrounded {{and most of its}} men were casualties while 200 were captured. Armored losses were 200–300 tanks destroyed. One source puts the losses at roughly 200 by morning, but several battalion-sized attacks to regain the forts around El-Qantarah, and to reach some of the central and southern forts incurred further casualties with over 50 tanks being destroyed. In subsequent days some of the defenders <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bar</b> Lev Line managed to break though Egyptian forces and return to their lines, or were extracted by Israeli forces in counterattacks that came later on.|$|E

50|$|The {{most recent}} {{construction}} <b>in</b> Somerville, <b>the</b> college <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> Vaughan replaces <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> House. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> is housed <b>in</b> a mainly glass structure, with seating <b>in</b> <b>the</b> college colours {{of red and}} black. Chadlington Oxford Blonde ale is served at £2.50 a pint and the pool table costs 50p per frame.|$|R
50|$|<b>The</b> <b>bar</b> {{deteriorated}} through <b>the</b> {{middle of}} the 20th century. Alvin Reid, Sr. purchased it in 1988 and restored the original Art Deco interior from September 1999 to March 2000, during <b>the</b> only closure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar's</b> history.|$|R
5|$|Musicians often socialised in the Gioconda café at No. 9. David Bowie {{recruited}} {{his first}} backing band, The Lower Third, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> while the Small Faces formed {{after the original}} members socialised at the Gioconda. Other regular patrons included David Bowie and Jimi Hendrix. In April 2014, a number of music industry figures, including disc jockey Mike Read, unveiled a blue plaque above the premises that included a QR Code to access a multimedia presentation {{about the history of}} music.|$|E
5|$|One of Bart's early {{hallmarks}} was his prank {{calls to}} Moe's Tavern owner Moe Szyslak in which Bart calls Moe {{and asks for}} a gag name. Moe tries to find that person <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> but soon realizes it is a prank call and angrily threatens Bart. These calls were apparently based {{on a series of}} prank calls known as the Tube Bar recordings, though Groening has denied any causal connection.|$|E
5|$|Stewie {{discovers the}} Keebler Elves after {{crashing}} into the tree, who plan to kill their competition: Snap, Crackle and Pop, {{with the help of}} Judd Hirsch's nuclear weapon, which Peter views while peeking through a ball return at the bowling alley. Later on <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> Crackle and Pop are seen discussing an attack by the Keebler Elves which apparently resulted in Snap's death.|$|E

50|$|The punk scene would {{morph into}} an indie rock and pop scene, which was {{reflected}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar's</b> ongoing eclectic lineups. The last show booked was in 1987.|$|R

5|$|This {{homophonic}} choral {{passage is}} followed by the first of three short four-bar orchestral ritornellos, with a texture that has already been heard very briefly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> when the chorus pause between the fugato and homophonic passages. As in the opening sinfonia, the instruments play in four distinct groups—alto recorders, oboes, upper strings and continuo—but the sparseness there is now replaced by a jubilant canzona-style flourish.|$|E
5|$|With {{the repeal}} of Prohibition, the Black Cat re-opened in 1933 at 710 Montgomery Street, again under Ridley's proprietorship. Sol Stoumen bought the bar in the 1940s. In {{the early years of}} Stoumen's ownership, the Black Cat was a center for the bohemian and Beat crowd. William Saroyan and John Steinbeck were known to {{frequent}} the establishment, and part of Jack Kerouac's seminal Beat novel On the Road is set <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bar Hemingway was the {{favourite}} bar of Ernest Hemingway and is said {{by some to}} be {{the birthplace}} of the Bloody Mary cocktail which was invented for him. However, the claim is disputed as Fernand Petiot claimed to have invented the drink in 1921 while working at Harry's New York Bar, a frequent Paris hangout for Hemingway and other American expatriates, rather than <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> in the Ritz itself. The bar has been restored to its original appearance, with rich wood panelling and leather upholstery and has 25 original photographs on the walls taken by the author of places and people that inspired him.|$|E

5|$|Flanagan's first {{concert was}} around 1945, with trombonist Frank Rosolino. Given Flanagan was only around 15 {{years old at}} the time, he could not stay <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> area of the club; between sets, therefore, he went to another room and did some homework. As a teenager, he played in a band led by Lucky Thompson that also {{contained}} Pepper Adams and Kenny Burrell. Still in his teens, Flanagan also sat in on piano for some appearances by Charlie Parker in Detroit. During 1949, Flanagan had his first residence, at the Blue Bird Inn in Detroit. In 1950 he played with Rudy Rutherford, until the clarinetist returned to the Count Basie band. Flanagan then played jazz and rhythm and blues with saxophonist George Benson in Toledo, before being drafted into the army in 1951.|$|E
5|$|The mob lit garbage on {{fire and}} stuffed it through the broken windows as the police grabbed a fire hose. Because it had no water pressure, the hose was {{ineffective}} in dispersing the crowd, and seemed only to encourage them. When demonstrators broke through the windows—which had been covered by plywood by the bar owners to deter the police from raiding the bar—the police inside unholstered their pistols. The doors flew open and officers pointed their weapons at the angry crowd, threatening to shoot. The Village Voice writer Howard Smith, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> with the police, took a wrench from the bar and stuffed it in his pants, unsure if {{he might have to}} use it against the mob or the police. He watched someone squirt lighter fluid into the bar; as it was lit and the police took aim, sirens were heard and fire trucks arrived. The onslaught had lasted 45minutes.|$|E
5|$|Tom Kenderson (Alan Autry), an {{old friend}} and {{baseball}} teammate of bartender Sam Malone (Ted Danson), announces in his forthcoming autobiography that he is homosexual. At a press conference held at the bar, Sam, having not read the book in advance, is shocked about Tom's revelation. Diane Chambers (Shelley Long) helps Sam to calm down, and they discuss Tom. Moments later, Sam publicly accepts and supports Tom and his sexuality, which local newspapers report on their front pages. The next day, as they read the newspaper, the bar's regular patronsincluding Norm (George Wendt)express their disdain toward homosexuals and their worries that Sam's support for his old friend will turn Cheers into a gay bar. Diane criticizes their homophobia and says that there are actually two gay men <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar.</b>|$|E

5|$|Upstairs, Stewie takes drastic {{measures}} to protect his plans, programming the machine {{to go back in}} time before he drew them up. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar,</b> Peter and Lois have a heart-to-heart conversation, and they do not immediately notice that the bar is burning. When they try to escape, the stairs become blocked and they are trapped. Stewie reverses time just as Peter is having an epiphany about how poorly he treats Lois, and seconds before the basement bar goes up in flames. They all travel back in time, to when Lois asked Peter to take Chris to the game. While he is getting ready, Peter trips on Stewie's time machine, destroying it and injuring his leg, thus preventing him from taking Chris to his soccer match, while Stewie is left to suffer with more teething pain.|$|E
5|$|After {{several members}} of the {{resistance}} are killed by the Gestapo, Winther suspects they have an informant among them. Later, Bent visits Ketty's hotel room, and they have sex. Meanwhile, Jørgen visits his wife and advises her boyfriend to treat her properly or he will return. In a meeting, Winther says the informer is Ketty and orders her death. Bent meets Ketty; she tells him she works for both Winther and army intelligence, and that Winther does not work for the British. Winther, involved with Gilbert and Seibold, had ordered them to be killed in order not {{to be seen as a}} traitor. Bent and Jørgen search for Winther <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> and discover that he has escaped to Stockholm. They realize it is a trap, and they escape from the Gestapo men. They decide to kill Karl Heinz Hoffmann, the Gestapo's leader, and then take over the favorite Gestapo restaurant. Bent cannot kill Hoffmann because they have to get away when he notices the police coming. That night, Ketty says to Bent that he and Jørgen should go to Stockholm. In the meeting, they are offered positions in the Danish Army but they refuse. A man called Ravnen gives them the name of the real informer, and Jørgen soon kills him.|$|E
5|$|Four {{practice}} sessions were held before the Sunday race—two on Friday, and two on Saturday. The Friday {{morning and afternoon}} sessions each lasted an hour. The third and final {{practice sessions}} were held on Saturday morning and lasted 45 minutes. The Friday morning and afternoon sessions were held in dry and warm weather conditions. Michael Schumacher was fastest in the first practice session {{with a time of}} 1 minute and 38.474 seconds, ahead of Häkkinen and Coulthard. Barrichello set the fourth quickest time and caused the session to be yellow flagged when he lost control of his car and spun at the hairpin between turns ten and eleven and crashed into the perimeter fencing. Ralf Schumacher was fifth fastest, ahead of Fisichella. Frentzen and Jarno Trulli set the seventh and ninth fastest times respectively for Jordan; they were separated by Jaguar's Eddie Irvine. Jacques Villeneuve <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>BAR</b> completed the top ten despite spinning off the circuit which caused grass to penetrate his radiators. In the second practice session, Michael Schumacher set the fastest lap of the day, a 1:37.728, six-tenths of a second faster than Häkkinen. Barrichello had trouble selecting first gear on his final run although he set the third quickest time. Coulthard was fourth fastest, ahead of Button. Frentzen and Trulli continued their good form setting the sixth and seventh fastest times. Arrows driver Pedro de la Rosa, Villeneuve and Ricardo Zonta completed the top ten fastest drivers. During the session, an earthquake measuring 7.1 on the richter scale was felt at Suzuka, although no structural damage was reported around the circuit despite mild alarm.|$|E

50|$|<b>The</b> second {{movement}} <b>in</b> B-flat major is {{slower and}} more dignified. The rising melodic ideas <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening six <b>bars</b> {{are reminiscent of}} the first movement's recitative. Other ideas in this movement mirror the first, for instance, a figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> eighth <b>bar</b> and parallel passages of the second movement are similar to a figure <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sixth <b>bar</b> of <b>the</b> first.|$|R
50|$|There was {{a bar in}} New York City's East Village named <b>the</b> Korova Milk <b>Bar</b> styled after <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> film. <b>The</b> <b>bar</b> closed <b>in</b> October 2006; it {{had served}} as a {{gathering}} site for the city's goth, punk, industrial, metal, hardcore, and fetish subcultures for many years. <b>In</b> September 2007, <b>the</b> <b>bar</b> re-opened <b>in</b> White Plains, New York. This location has also since closed.|$|R
