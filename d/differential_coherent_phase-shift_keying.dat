First, a new IS- 95 compatible demodulation scheme is introduced which avoids some disadvantages of conventional incoherent demodulation {{by using the}} signal power of each propagation path in the demodulation process.

40|$|Abstract—We {{propose a}} signal {{processing}} technique, {{based on the}} estimate-maximize algorithm, in order to perform multiuser code-division multiple-access (CDMA) detection. This algorithm iteratively seeks for the maximum-likelihood solution. The resulting structure is a successive interference cancellation scheme which {{can be applied to}} both synchronous and asynchronous CDMA. Higher performance than similar methods is obtained from using deterministic annealing and multiple stages. A soft output is defined, and the signal-to-noise ratio in the soft output of the detector is measured for predicting performance with an outer code with soft input decoder. The new receiver is applied to the problem whereby in a synchronous CDMA system the orthogonality of the codes is destroyed by a frequency-selective channel, caused by multipath fading. This nonlinear technique is shown to perform much better than the minimum mean-square-error linear solution and several other algorithms. The algorithm lends itself to an efficient DSP or VLSI implementation. We evaluate the performance by simulations with <b>coherent</b> quadrature <b>phase-shift</b> <b>keying</b> modulation, known channel and long random Rayleigh multipath.
