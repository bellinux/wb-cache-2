5|$|A {{critical}} <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> {{to design}} protected areas for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use}} of protected areas have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

25|$|The {{wearing of}} hijab in France {{has been a}} very {{controversial}} issue since 1989. The debate essentially concerns whether Muslim girls who choose to wear hijab may do so in state schools. A secondary <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> to protect the free choice and other rights of young Muslim women who do not want the veil, but who may face strong pressure from families or traditionalists. Similar issues exist for civil servants and for acceptance of male Muslim medics in medical services.|$|E
50|$|Another {{important}} <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> {{to pay for}} municipal services. One {{proposal was}} to sell city assets. Rossi proposed selling Toronto Hydro. Sarah Thomson called for restructuring TCHC and a line by line review of every department at city hall.|$|R
50|$|A further {{fundamental}} <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> {{to distribute}} the excess customs duties from the central government to the states. For the larger colonies there was the possibility (which never became an actuality) {{that they could be}} required to subsidise the struggling economies of Tasmania, South Australia and Western Australia.|$|R
50|$|Another {{issue that}} had to be solved was the {{establishment}} of a management company that has to operate the bridge and collect tolls. Pending <b>issues</b> <b>were</b> <b>how</b> and where that company would be registered, dispute resolution methods and what fiscal law it would be subject to. In October 2012 it was expected that this company would be located in Sofia.|$|R
25|$|Some Tocotrienols, {{especially}} delta- and gamma-tocotrienols, {{are being}} promoted as statin alternative non-prescription agents to treat high cholesterol, having {{been shown in}} vitro to have an effect. In particular, gamma-tocotrienol appears to be another HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor, and can reduce cholesterol production. As with statins, this decrease in intra-hepatic (liver) LDL levels may induce hepatic LDL receptor up-regulation, also decreasing plasma LDL levels. As always, a key <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> benefits and complications of such agents compare with statinsmolecular tools that have been analyzed in large numbers of human research and clinical trials since the mid-1970s.|$|E
2500|$|... "In a {{telephone}} interview, Jon Pedersen, research {{director for the}} 2004 [...] study, said several factors probably account for researchers' different findings. One key <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> researchers extrapolate from the deaths identified in their field research to a death toll for the whole country. Pedersen noted that the Lancet study {{is based on a}} pre-invasion mortality rate of 5.5 deaths per thousand people [...] The U.N., he said, used the figure of 9 deaths per thousand. Extrapolating from the lower pre-invasion mortality rate would yield a greater increase in post-invasion deaths, he noted." ...|$|E

The <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> to determine the value of B by experiment. There are two obvious ways. (1) Suppose that eq. (43) can be used to determine a reasonably accurate experimental value of κ, from the slope of a plot of form [...] In this case, a second plot, of ln(i)/V'κ vs. 1/V, should be an exact straight line of slope –B. This approach should be the most accurate way of determining B.|$|E
50|$|In {{applying}} the above analysis to Doré's case, the Court {{found that the}} <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> to balance the right of freedom of expression and making open criticism of the judicial process {{with the need to}} ensure civility in the legal profession. The Court went on to find that the Discipline Council's decision to reprimand Doré was not an unreasonable balance.|$|R

50|$|An escribitionist is {{a person}} who keeps a diary or journal via {{electronic}} means, and in particular, publishes their entries on the world wide web. The word was coined in June 1999 by Erin Venema, an online diarist, {{in the course of a}} discussion on a mailing list for web journalers.

2500|$|A major <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> many embryos {{should be}} transferred. Placement of {{multiple}} embryos carries {{the risk of}} multiple pregnancy. In the past, physicians have often placed too many embryos in the hope to establish a pregnancy. However, the rise in multiple pregnancies {{has led to a}} reassessment of this approach. Professional societies and in many countries, the legislature, have issued guidelines or laws to curtail a practice of placing too many embryos in an attempt to reduce multiple pregnancies. The appropriate number of embryos to be transferred depends on the age of the woman, whether it is the first, second or third full IVF cycle attempt and whether there are top-quality embryos available. According to a guideline from The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) in 2013, the number of embryos transferred in a cycle should be chosen as in following table: ...|$|E
2500|$|Although some {{solutions}} attribute {{a crucial}} role to the acceleration of the travelling twin {{at the time of}} the turnaround, others note that the effect also arises if one imagines separate outward-going and inward-coming travellers, who pass each other and synchronize their clocks at the point corresponding to [...] "turnaround" [...] of a single traveller. In this version, physical acceleration of the travelling clock plays no direct role; [...] "the <b>issue</b> <b>is</b> <b>how</b> long the world-lines are, not how bent". The length referred to here is the Lorentz-invariant length or [...] "proper time interval" [...] of a trajectory which corresponds to the elapsed time measured by a clock following that trajectory (see Section Difference in elapsed time as a result of differences in twins' spacetime paths below). In Minkowski spacetime, the travelling twin must feel a different history of accelerations from the earthbound twin, even if this just means accelerations of the same size separated by different amounts of time, however [...] "even this role for acceleration can be eliminated in formulations of the twin paradox in curved spacetime, where the twins can fall freely along space-time geodesics between meetings".|$|E

These services provide value added by considering the location of the user in order to give him/her more customized information.

Mayoral candidate Robert Lee supported enhancing {{the capacity of}} the existing plant, while his opponent, Thomas Bellamy, favoured constructing a new plant. According to the Edmonton Bulletin, Lee's earlier entry into the race and early success at recruiting prominent citizens as his public supporters was a decisive factor in his defeat of Bellamy, who entered the race later.|$|R

50|$|For eight years, Alan Kay, Allen Cypher, and Smith {{worked closely}} {{together}} in the Advanced Technology Group {{to find a way}} to teach children how to program. During this project, they faced two main issues. The first <b>issue</b> <b>was</b> <b>how</b> to input programs without boring or overwhelming students and the second <b>was</b> <b>how</b> to understand how a program works once it is written. Their efforts were ultimately successful and they developed a system called KidSim (for Kids' Simulations). The system enabled children as young as preschoolers to program video games that other children could play.|$|R
