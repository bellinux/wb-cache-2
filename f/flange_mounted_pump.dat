50|$|Flange mountsâ€”Very {{strong and}} rigid, but have little {{tolerance}} for misalignment. Experts recommend cap end mounts for thrust loads and rod end mounts where major loading puts the piston rod in tension. Three types are head rectangular flange, head square flange or rectangular head. <b>Flange</b> <b>mounts</b> function optimally when the mounting face attaches to a machine support member.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, floating/barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be {{installed}} along with associated piping on the reservoir bed to pump water from the reservoir's dead storage into left and right bank canals and the approach channel of the existing pump house of Hyderabad water supply scheme during drought years. During the good monsoon years, when the reservoir water level is above the dead storage level, the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> can be used regularly to pump water into the existing high level (flood flow) canal (near [...] ) located on the left bank of the reservoir in Nalgonda district. Similarly, during the good monsoon years, a lift irrigation scheme can be taken up {{with the help of}} the same barge <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> to lift water from the reservoir (near [...] ) by 45 m height for irrigating nearly 200,000 acres of uplands situated adjacent to the reservoir in Guntur district. Thus all the installed barge <b>mounted</b> mobile <b>pump</b> houses can be used for regular pumping needs to maximise the water use from the reservoir every year.|$|R

Stresses went down significantly with the corrections of the flange detail. The fields and field transients during a disruption were applied using vector potential boundary conditions. The changing fields are imposed, throughout the space the coupler occupies, thus the inductive response of the coupler has no effect on altering the local fields. The assumption is that the field transients are driven predominantly by all the structure...|$|R
40|$|Lecturepg. 69 Under extreme conditions, pumps may be {{required}} to withstand severe nozzle loads, which often exceed the API 610 specified values. To meet these requirements, pump mechanical behavior versus nozzle loads must be examined in detail. Others have discussed shaft end displacement of centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> under nozzle loads. However, the subject of stresses on the pedestal bolts and casing is a critical area that must also be analyzed. An in-depth study was made on the deformation and stress analysis of centerline <b>mounted</b> end suction <b>pumps,</b> whose stiffness were relatively low and were frequently required to withstand rather high nozzle loads. The nozzle load analysis consisted of deformation and stress measurements, combined with finite element calculation. The analysis resulted in a versatile empirical formula for end suction, centerline <b>mounted</b> <b>pumps</b> {{that can be used to}} estimate the shaft end displacement, pedestal bolt stress and casing stress for arbitrary nozzle loads. This allows the determination of whether or not specified nozzle loading conditions can be tolerated by a given pump and pump support design...|$|R

In this paper, a new compliant <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> {{on the end of the}} industrial robots for the robotic {{grinding and polishing}} force control is developed. With regard to the non-linear and time-varying problem of the contact force, the mathematical model of the new force control system was presented and the fuzzy PID control strategy was used to drive the proposed system. Especially, the air spring and electric proportional valve is studied to establish the model. The simulation results show that the selected control strategy has quick response and good robustness, which satisfies the real-time requirements of the grinding and polishing force control in processing...|$|R
50|$|A full-diameter non-fast-opening {{rear door}} costs little, all things considered. On larger machines, {{it can be}} mounted on a hinge, davit, or dolly {{assembly}} (see photo above) that allows it to be swung or {{moved away from the}} autoclave once its bolted <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> has been separated. This provides the best possible access to the works inside. It also means that critical components are never buried deep inside the machine where they are hard to get at and thus very likely to be ignored until they cause problems. One mid-sized autoclave built for a southern aircraft repair shop to be as cheap as humanly possible lacked easy access to the circulation fan, and, when last observed by one of the manufacturer's service engineers, was making the most alarming dry-bearing noises whenever it ran.|$|R

50|$|Rotating paddle level sensors are a {{very old}} and {{established}} technique for bulk solid point level indication. The technique uses a low-speed gear motor that rotates a paddle wheel. When the paddle is stalled by solid materials, the motor is rotated on its shaft by its own torque until a <b>flange</b> <b>mounted</b> on the motor contacts a mechanical switch. The paddle can be constructed {{from a variety of}} materials, but tacky material must not be allowed to build up on the paddle. Build-up may occur if the process material becomes tacky because of high moisture levels or high ambient humidity in the hopper. For materials with very low weight per unit volume such as Pearlite, Bentonite or fly ash, special paddle designs and low-torque motors are used. Fine particles or dust must be prevented from penetrating the shaft bearings and motor by proper placement of the paddle in the hopper or bin and using appropriate seals.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} known {{audio tape}} recorder was a non-magnetic, non-electric version invented by Alexander Graham Bell's Volta Laboratory and patented in 1886 (...) [...] It employed a 3/16 in strip of wax-covered paper that was coated by dipping it {{in a solution}} of beeswax and paraffin and then had one side scraped clean, with the other side allowed to harden. The machine was of sturdy wood and metal construction, and hand-powered {{by means of a}} knob fastened to the flywheel. The wax strip passed from one eight-inch reel around the periphery of a pulley (with guide <b>flanges)</b> <b>mounted</b> above the V-pulleys on the main vertical shaft, where it came in contact with either its recording or playback stylus. The tape was then taken up on the other reel. The sharp recording stylus, actuated by a vibrating mica diaphragm, cut the wax from the strip. In playback mode, a dull, loosely mounted stylus, attached to a rubber diaphragm, carried the reproduced sounds through an ear tube to its listener.|$|R

40|$|An {{extractor}} type ionization gauge {{has been}} developed for <b>flange</b> <b>mounting</b> in a 15. 7 mm diam. aperture. The gauge electrodes are aligned by ceramic plates. A cylindrical anode grid of 9 mm diam. and 12. 5 mm length is formed of photo-etched W-sheet. A thoria coated W-filament is employed made from two semicircular loops mounted outside and concentric with the anode grid. The two halves of the filament are connected in parallel. The height of the electrodes {{from the top of}} the anode grid to the base of the hemispherical collector is 18. 9 mm. The gauge design is a compromise between obtaining a low X-ray or pressure limit, high sensitivity and high electron emission current. The foregoing, given in the same order, were respectively 5 * 10 /sup - 12 / torr; 5 torr/sup - 1 / for N/sub 2 / at 10 mA emission current and 6 torr/sup - 1 / at below 5 mA; and an emission current of between 5 - 10 mA which gave the high anode current density required to maintain a clean grid.
