The genetic and physiological basis of some disorders in melon (Cucumis melo L.) are unknown and particularly the possible relation with climacteric behavior. A collection of melon near-isogenic lines (NILs) (SC 3 - 5 and seven more showing climacteric and two non-climacteric ripening pattern) were analyzed to study genetic and physiological aspects of <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> and rots. Two non-climacteric (Nicolás; Inodorus Group; and Shongwan Charmi PI 161375, Conomon Group) and two climacteric cultivars (Fado, Reticulatus Group; Védrantais, Cantaloupensis Group) were used as reference. The field was divided in eight blocks containing one three-plant replication for each NIL, two for the parental cultivar Piel de Sapo {{and one or two}} for the reference cultivars. Replications evaluated were more than six in the cultivars studied. Plant problems included aphids, powdery mildew, and leaf wind injury. Preharvest <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> included whole fruit cracking in cultivar Védrantais and NIL 5 M 2, and stylar-end cracking in cultivar Fado. Climacteric NILs with yellow skin were particularly affected by over-ripening, stylar-end cracking, and sunburn during cultivation. At harvest, two NILs showed slight placental tissue necrosis which was inherited from SC and were also detected after storage. Other uncommon disorders seen at harvest or 30 days after storage at 8 ºC included warted skin (scarring), flesh discoloration (light brown or translucent areas), hollow flesh disorder, and deep furrow netting inherited from SC. Less common rots included grey mould, bacterial soft rot, Penicillium rot, cottony leak and internal Cladosporium rot. Stylar-end hardness below 20 N·mm- 1 was associated with cracking and softening.

Results indicated that the fruit growth pattern appeared a sigmoid curve. In the fruit mineral concentrations, {{there were no significant differences}} in nitrogen and potassium between peel and pulp, but the peel was found high in calcium and magnesium. The black paper bagged friuts had a higher nitrogen concentration the other treatments. There were no significant differences in calcium concentration s than between treatments. The N/Ca, K/Ca and Mg/Ca of friuts were higher in black-paper treatment, likewise the percentages of the friut disorders. Fruit analysis data indicated that the mineral concentrations were elevated in the affected fruits especially in the middle portion and styler-end in breakdown fruits. The N/Ca, K/Ca and Mg/Ca of friuts were higher in the affected fruits than the healthy ones after ethrel treatment. 本試驗調查'金煌'芒果果實劣變情形，探討不同材質套袋對'金煌'芒果果實生長發育及成份變化的影結果顯示，果實生長曲線均呈單S型，在果實養分方面以黑袋的氮含較高，在鈣含量方面，各套袋處理間均無明顯差異；其中以白袋之果實氮/鈣、鉀/鈣及鎂/鈣比較低，且果實劣變率亦低。比較劣變果與正常果之各部位養分含量，劣變果實之各部位含量均較正常果為高，氮/鈣、鉀/鈣及鎂/鈣比亦較正常果為高...|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} source-sink {{relationships}} {{on the performance}} of tomato and hot pepper was investigated in glasshouse experiments by pruning tomato trusses and hot pepper fruit from plants trained to a single stem. The objectives were to characterize the effect of time, method and intensity of pruning on the yield and quality of tomato and hot pepper. Pruning at anthesis as compared to pruning at fruit-set had little effect on yield and fruit quality of both crops. Yield per truss increased steadily with intensity of pruning in tomato, due to increase in fruit size and fruit number per truss. Thus, total yield was not affected by pruning. In hot pepper fruit size increased with intensity of pruning but total yield was significantly reduced and total plant dry mass depressed at higher source : sink ratios (two and three fruit pruned {{out of a total of}} six). Occurrence of <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> such as blossom-end rot and fruit cracking increased with increasing source: sink ratio. Pruning of one truss in tomato and one fruit in hot pepper gave the best fruit quality in terms of fruit size, pericarp thickness and freedom from defects, without decreasing total and marketable yield. Removing a middle truss of tomato (third truss) gave the highest yield as compared to removing the youngest truss (sixth truss) or the oldest truss (first truss). The yield increase (relative to the control) in the remaining individual trusses tended to decrease with increasing distance of the trusses from the pruned truss. In hot pepper removal of the youngest fruit (sixth fruit) resulted in the highest yield in comparison to removal of the middle fruit (third fruit) and the oldest fruit (first fruit). The quantity of yield increase in the remaining individual fruits had no consistent trend regarding the relative distance of the fruits from the pruned fruit. Two pruning methods were tried on hot pepper and tomato to compare yield and fruit quality. The first method involved pruning of the first three consecutive trusses of tomato and the first three consecutive fruit of hot pepper out of a total of six. The second method involved pruning of three alternating tomato trusses or hot pepper fruit. Yield and yield components did not differ significantly for the two methods, but pruning alternate trusses of tomato and fruit of hot pepper reduced occurrence of <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders.</b> Dissertation (MSc (Agric) Agronomy) [...] University of Pretoria, 2007.

Our study aimed to determine the effect of calcium supply on growth of young, vegetative tomato plants. The experiment was carried out in a growth chamber under fully controlled climate conditions. Treatments consisted of four periods of 1, 3, 7 or 14 days of low calcium (0. 5 meq l- 1) compared with the control (9 me l- 1). Plant dry matter content, total leaf area, leaf dry matter and specific leaf area were not affected after 14 days of low Ca supply. Ca concentrations in young leaves, stem, and roots were quickly reduced after only 1 day of low-Ca. After 14 days, Ca concentration in all plant organs (leaves, stems and roots) was reduced by approximately 70 % compared to control plants. Stomatal regulation was not affected by this level of calcium stress as leaf transpiration in treated plants was similar to control plants with the same leaf area.

40|$|Nitrogen (N) and {{potassium}} (K) {{are closely related}} to orchard productivity, since they are usually found in higher concentrations than others macronutrients in apple (Malus × domestica Borkh) fruits. This research was carried out to assess the effect of eight years of soil additions of N and K on yield, fruit size and mineral composition of 'Fuji'/Marubakaido apple in São Joaquim, State of Santa Catarina, Southern Brazil. A factorial design was used with N and K annual fertilizer rates (0, 50, 100, 200 kg ha- 1 of N and K 2 O) replicated in three orchards from 1998 to 2006. Yield was estimated by multiplying the total number of fruit per tree by the mean weight of 100 randomly sampled fruit. Fifteen days prior to harvest, 24 fruit pulps were analyzed for N, K, Ca and Mg contents. Increases in yields were noticed in five and four years, due to the N and K fertilizer additions, respectively. Fruit size was more affected by K than by N fertilization. Fruit mineral composition was affected by both N and K fertilization. N concentration and N:Ca ratios were enlarged by N fertilization. K concentration and K:Ca ratios were also enlarged by K fertilization. Ca fruit concentration was reduced by N fertilization and often by K. Ca-related <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> were not observed even after 180 days storage. However, N and K fertilization affected Ca nutrition.

Analisaram-se frutos de melão (Cucumis melo L.) provenientes de uma coleção de linhas quase-isogénicas (NIL), SC 3 - 5 e outras sete climatéricas e duas não-climatéricas, para avaliar a ocorrência de acidentes fisiológicos e a suscetibilidade a podridões. Como termo de comparação utilizou-se duas cultivares não-climatéricas (Nicolás, grupo Inodorus, e Shongwan Charmi ou acesso PI 161375, grupo Conomon) e duas cultivares climatéricas (Fado, grupo Reticulatus, e Védrantais, grupo Cantaloupensis).

As repetições avaliadas foram mais de seis para as cultivares em estudo. Durante a produção, as folhas foram afetadas por pulgão, oídio e acidentes meteorológicos. Os acidentes fisiológicos que ocorreram nos frutos durante a produção incluíram fendilhamento na cultivar Védrantais e na NIL 5 M 2 e fendilhamento da zona pistilar na cultivar Fado. As NIL climactéricas com casca amarela revelaram-se muito suscetíveis à sobre-maturação, fendilhamento pistilar e queimaduras solares durante a produção.

The viroid was {{discovered}} {{a few years}} ago, and {{only a limited number}} of sequence variants has been reported so far. In this work, the sequence variability of two ADFVd field iso-lates from two commercial apple cultivars was studied. Sequencing of 18 full-length cDNA clones revealed five new sequence variants, all adopting a similar quasi-rod-like secondary structure of lowest free energy. Sequence comparison showed nine polymorphic positions distrib-uted in different regions of the ADFVd molecule. Since symptoms of apple dimple fruit disease resemble those of dapple apple induced by Apple scar skin viroid (ASSVd), and it has been experimentally demonstrated that these two viroids may co-exist in the same plant, a fast and sensitive method for their rapid detection and discrimination is needed. We report here a method that meets such needs. Total nucleic acid minipreparations from symptomatic fruits, obtained by extraction with buffer-saturated phenol and further treatment with a silica-gel capture system, were used as templates for the simultaneous detection of ADFVd and ASSVd by mul-tiplex fluorescent RT-PCR amplification.

40|$|ABSTRACT Fertilization of {{temperate}} fruit trees, such as grapevine (Vitis spp.), apple (Malus domestica), and pear (Pyrus communis) is {{an important}} tool to achive maximum yield and fruit quality. Fertilizers are provided when soil fertility does not allow trees to express their genetic potential, and time and rate of application should be scheduled to promote fruit quality. Grapevine berries, must and wine quality are affected principally by N, that regulate the synthesis of some important compounds, such as anthocyanins, which are responsible for coloring of the must and the wine. Fermenation of the must may stop in grapes with low concentration of N because N is requested in high amount by yeasts. An N excess may increase the pulp to peel ratio, diluting the concentration of anthocyanins and promoting the migration of anthocyanins from berries to the growing plant organs; a decrease of grape juice soluble solid concentration is also expected because {{of an increase in}} vegetative growth. Potassium is also important for wine quality contributing to adequate berry maturation, concentration of sugars, synthesis of phenols and the regulation of pH and acidity. In apple and pear, Ca and K are important for fruit quality and storage. Potassium is the most important component of fruit, however, any excess should be avoided and an adequate K:Ca balance should be achieved. Adequate concentration of Ca in the fruit prevents pre- and post-harvest <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> and, at the same time, increases tolerance to pathogens. Although N promotes adequate growth soil N availability should be monitored to avoid excessive N uptake that may decrease fruit skin color and storability...|$|E

Higher Ca levels in the soil solution can increase the uptake of this nutrient by apple trees, reducing the risk of physiological disorders caused by Ca deficiency. This study assessed the effect of long-term gypsum application on some soil properties and on the chemical composition of leaves and fruits of an apple cultivar susceptible to <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> associated with low Ca. The experiment was conducted in São Joaquim, in the South of Brazil, from 2001 to 2009. Gypsum rates of 0, 1. 0, 2. 0 and 3. 0 t ha- 1 were annually broadcast over the soil surface, without incorporation, in an apple orchard with cultivar ´Catarina´, planted in 1997. Gypsum application over eight consecutive years had no effect on soil exchangeable K and Al to a depth of 80 cm, but increased exchangeable Ca in the sampled layers (0 - 10, 10 - 20, 40 - 60 and 60 - 80 cm), while exchangeable Mg decreased only in the surface layer (0 - 20 cm). Gypsum did not affect the concentration of any nutrient in the fruits, including Ca. The same was verified in the leaves, except for Mg which decreased with increased gypsum rate.

In few years, a set of tools have been developed and used, mainly in peach, apricot and almond. Transcriptomics tools have been primarily used to investigate fruit ripening and post-harvest physiology, but also disease resistance and flower transition. At the beginning of the second decade of the century, more than 100, 000 ESTs are available in public databases, the majority of which were obtained from peach fruit. This repertoire has been used for digital expression analyses of transcriptome changes associated with fruit ripening and the appearance of chilling-induced post-harvest <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders.</b> The microarrays developed on peach ESTs have been extensively used mainly to investigate fruit biology but are soon going to be replaced by genome-wide platforms based on the recently released peach genome sequence.

40|$|Huanglongbing (HLB) or "citrus greening" is {{the most}} {{destructive}} citrus disease worldwide. In this work, we studied host responses of citrus to infection with Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CaLas) using next-generation sequencing technologies. A deep mRNA profile was obtained from peel of healthy and HLB- affected fruit. It was followed by pathway and protein-protein network analysis and quantitative real time PCR analysis of highly regulated genes. We identified differentially regulated pathways and constructed networks that provide a deep insight into the metabolism of affected fruit. Data mining revealed that HLB enhanced transcription of genes involved in the light reactions of photosynthesis and in ATP synthesis. Activation of protein degradation and misfolding processes were observed at the transcriptomic level. Transcripts for heat shock proteins were down-regulated at all disease stages, resulting in further protein misfolding. HLB strongly affected pathways involved in source-sink communication, including sucrose and starch metabolism and hormone synthesis and signaling. Transcription of several genes involved in the synthesis and signal transduction of cytokinins and gibberellins was repressed while that of genes involved in ethylene pathways was induced. CaLas infection triggered a response via both the salicylic acid and jasmonic acid pathways and increased the transcript abundance of {{several members of the}} WRKY family of transcription factors.

40|$|In recent years, {{a disease}} {{that appears to be}} black end has {{increased}} in several pear orchards in the Sacramento River district. According to Ogawa and English (1991), “black-end ” or “hard-end” are names given to a pear <b>fruit</b> <b>disorder</b> in which the tissue of the calyx end of the ripe fruit is hard and dry and the pH of the tissue is high. The disorder is known to affect mainly trees on Asian rootstocks such as Pyrus serotina, P. ussuriensis, and P. betulaefolia, but not trees on rootstocks such as Winter Nelis and Old Home × Farmingdale (Raese 1994 b). It was postulated to be caused by certain metabolites produced in Asian pear rootstocks and translocated to the fruit (Ryugo 1988). Black end was commonly seen before the 1960 s, but since the far majority of trees on Asian rootstocks have since been removed due to pear decline, the disorder has become very rare. In recent years, however, the disorder is reappearing and seems to be increasing in some orchards that are largely on P. communis rootstocks. One possible cause of black end is water stress (Ohlendorf 1999, Welsh 1979). Both water stress and poor drainage can kill or stunt roots and may send similar metabolites to the fruit as occurs with Asian rootstocks.

Small fruit may appear in few or even all trees of the orchards as well as on few or several branches of each tree. Recovery phenomena and reappearance of the symptoms were observed. Malus xdomestica 'Starking Delicious', widely cultivated at Pelion Mountain, showed high susceptibility. Preliminary studies on the aetiology of this phenomenon were focused to physiological abnormalities in small fruits and to pathogen detection. In small fruits, a high concentration of Mn is observed. The basic colour is not modified, but anthocyanids in the phloem are reduced. Soluble solids and dry mass is decreased, but no difference in pH and acidity is measured. Small apples also show inability in reaching maturation, as they are harder and remain on the tree for many weeks after harvest. Injections with oxytetracycline in a small number of trees were carried out; in the next year a remission of the symptoms in 60 % of cases was observed. In September 2005, PCR diagnostic tests for Candidatus Phytoplasma mali in symptomatic trees were performed revealing high presence of the pathogen in the region; out of the 131 trees tested, 43 were positive.

40|$|Calcium sprays have {{normally}} improved {{both the}} quality and the storage life of apples throughout the world because Ca helps to prevent many <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> and that taken up from the soil does not often reach the fruit in adequate amounts. Since the efficacy of Ca sprays varies according to soil, apple cultivar, and weather conditions, this study was carried out from 1998 to 2004, in the Southern of Brazil, {{in order to assess}} the effect of Ca sprays on {{the quality and}} storability of 'Gala' fruits. The experiment was set up in an orchard planted in 1988, on a density of 1234 trees/ha. Treatments consisted of 0, 4, 8, and 12 annual sprays of 0. 5 % CaCl 2 regularly distributed 30 days after petal fall until one week before harvest. Fruits of the same size and maturity level were annually analyzed at harvest and after five months of conventional cold storage (- 1 ºC and 90 - 95 % of RH). In five out of six seasons, fruits from all treatments were free of any physiological disorder, and Ca sprays had no effect on leaf composition and on any fruit attribute (soluble solids, titratable acidity, starch pattern index, flesh firmness, and concentrations of N, K, Ca and Mg). In the season of 2000 / 2001, however, when yield was 18 t ha- 1 and fruits had an average weight of 175 g, the incidence of bitter pit plus lenticel blotch pit on stored fruits was 24 % in the treatment with no calcium sprays and it decreased up to 2 % in that with 12 sprays. Two seasons later, yield was also low (25 t ha- 1) and fruits were large (168 g each), but they did not show any physiological disorder regardless of the number of Ca sprays. It seems that the incidence of Ca related disorders in 'Gala' apples grown on limed soils in Brazil with no excess of any nutrient only occurs on seasons with low crop yield, as a result of large fruits and a high leaf/fruit ratio, associated with some unknown environmental conditions...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} was to {{investigate}} how preharvest calcium (Ca) and nitrogen (N) nutrition, and low crop load during fruit development affect fruit quality and postharvest disease of Keitt mangoes (Mangifera indica L). Calcium, N and crop load were chosen because previous research and Gower reports implicate them as major factors in internal disorders, poor colour development, and postharvest disease in mangoes grown in the Mareeba district of Queensland. The symptoms and incidence of the internal <b>fruit</b> <b>disorders</b> seen in Keitt mangoes growing in Queensland were investigated to determine their similarity {{to other forms of}} internal disorders, and to develop a severity rating scale to assess fruit in later experiments. While the observed disorder in Keitt shared some symptoms with other named forms of disorders, not all symptoms were similar. The typical symptoms of patches of watery translucent flesh that breakdown and discharge cellular fluids in the more severe cases, are referred to as watery-pulp breakdown throughout this thesis. Watery-pulp breakdown-affected fruit had lower mesocarp Ca concentrations (0. 05 % dw) than healthy fruit (0. 10 % dw), but not N, K, P, and Mg concentrations. The severity of symptoms increased as maturity of the fruit increased, and early harvest may be a useful strategy to minimise the disorder. The first nutrition experiment investigated the effects of Ca, N and crop load on fruit quality in 6 -year-old Keitt trees, between 1997 and 2000. Trees were fertilised with high (> 1 kg Ca tree- 1 and > 300 g N tree- 1) or nil concentrations of Ca and N, and natural or 70 %-reduced crop loads. Fruit were assessed for watery-pulp breakdown, fruit colour, postharvest disease, fruit firmness, yield and average fruit weight. Although Ca was applied above the normal industry rates, there were no significant increases in fruit-Ca or leaf- Ca concentrations, or response in any of the fruit quality parameters measured. The factors influencing Ca concentrations in mesocarp were shown to be changes in dry matter accumulation and periodic reductions in Ca supply. Fruit from the high N treatment had significantly (p < 0. 05) greater incidence and severity of postharvest side disease lesions (mainly anthracnose) but not stem lesions (mainly stem-end rot). The high N treatments also significantly (p < 0. 05) reduced the percentage of yellow skin, and the percentage and intensity of red blush colour in ripe fruit. Watery-pulp breakdown, fruit firmness and average fruit weight were not significantly affected by the high N treatments. Reducing the crop load throughout fruit development significantly (p< 0. 05) increased the average fruit weights and the incidence of watery-pulp breakdown, but did not significantly affect the other fruit quality parameters measured. Further studies on Ca uptake and distribution were carried out in 3 additional experiments. The effects of Ca supply on fruit quality were investigated in a similar manner to the first experiment, by varying soil-applied Ca. Increased rates (1726 g tree- 1 Ca) and more frequent applications (fortnightly) of gypsum were used to overcome leaching. Although soil Ca concentrations at harvest (0 - 30 cm deep) were increased by the Ca treatment, no significant effects were observed on fruit quality. The effect of leaf transpiration on leaf and fruit Ca concentrations was investigated by reducing leaf transpiration with an anti-transpirant throughout flowering and fruit development. Reduced leaf transpiration did not significantly affect mesocarp or leaf Ca, N, P, Mg, K, B concentrations, indicating the balance of transpiration mass flow between leaves and fruit is not a major factor in mango fruit Ca accumulation. Temporal changes in uptake and distribution of Ca during flowering and fruit development were studied using elemental strontium (Sr) as a Ca analogue. Sr and Ca concentrations were not similar during the experiment making prediction of Ca uptake and distribution based on Sr uptake and partitioning unsuitable. The effect of high N in increasing postharvest fruit disease in the first experiment was further studied to confirm the earlier results and to identify the mechanisms involved in this relationship. Fruit with a range of N concentrations were produced from trees fertilised with a range of N rates (0  417 g tree- 1). The incidence and severity of postharvest anthracnose (C. gloeosporioides) increased as fruit-N increased, with significant relationships between anthracnose severity and exocarp-N concentration (anthracnose severity in sprung fruit = 163. 18 x 2  151. 85 x + 36. 987, r 2 = 0. 97 **). High N had a similar effect on the incidence of Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., or Epicoccum sp., but not Dothiorella sp. (stem-end rot). The antifungal compounds 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol were influenced by exocarp-N in two ways. Resorcinol concentrations were lower in fruit with high exocarp-N than low-N fruit, and concentrations decreased faster in ripening fruit with high exocarp-N. The differences in resorcinol concentrations between high- and low-N fruit was strongest in the sprung stage of ripeness, and positive exponential relationships were found between exocarp-N and concentrations of 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p= 0. 006. r 2 = 0. 92) and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p= 0. 016, r 2 = 0. 82). There were also positive relationships between anthracnose severity and 5 -n-pentadecyl resorcinol (p= 0. 003, r 2 = 0. 86) and 5 -n-heptadecenyl resorcinol (p= 0. 003, r 2 = 0. 87). No significant differences were observed in exocarp morphology to explain the N effect on postharvest disease incidence or severity. The effect of timing of application of N on fruit quality and disease was investigated in a field experiment on 8 -year-old Keitt mango trees on which N was applied at flowering, at mid fruit development, 2 weeks pre-harvest, or not applied (control). N applied at flowering and mid fruit development, significantly increased the severity of postharvest Colletotrichum sp. (p< 0. 05) Penicillium sp., Rhizopus sp., Guibnardia sp., and Epicoccum sp. (p< 0. 01) in ripe fruit. N applied 2 weeks prior to harvest did not significantly affect postharvest diseases, with fruit having similar anthracnose severity and incidence to the nil-N (control) treatment. Fruit Ca concentrations were not able to be manipulated by imposing field treatments. The inability to easily manipulate fruit Ca concentrations indicates it is unlikely to be an effective tool to manipulate fruit quality in mango. Nitrogen was shown to greatly influence fruit quality, having a major influence on postharvest disease, skin colour and sunburn susceptibility, but not watery-pulp breakdown. Increased N was also shown to reduce concentrations of natural antifungal resorcinol compounds as fruit ripened, making fruit more susceptible to postharvest rots. The sensitivity of fruit quality to N makes management of N a critical tool in managing fruit quality and disease susceptibility. Reduced crop load had a major effect on the incidence and severity of watery-pulp breakdown, indicating tree management practices to maximise crop load will also reduce the severity of watery-pulp breakdown...|$|E

Papaya fruits were firstly stored at 7 °C and 12 °C for 25 and 30 days, respectively, then treated with exogenous ethylene and followed by ripening at 25 °C for 5 days. Chilling injury symptoms such as pulp water soaking were observed in fruit stored at 7 °C on 20 days, whereas the coloration and softening were completely blocked after 25 days, Large differences in the changes in the expression levels of twenty two genes involved in ethylene were seen during 7 °C-storage with chilling injury. Those genes with altered expression could be divided into three groups: the group of genes that were up-regulated, including ACS 1 / 2 / 3, EIN 2, EIN 3 s/EIL 1, CTR 1 / 2 / 3, and ERF 1 / 3 / 4; the group of genes that were down-regulated, including ACO 3, ETR 1, CTR 4, EBF 2, and ERF 2; and the group of genes that were un-regulated, including ACO 1 / 2, ERS, and EBF 1. The results also showed that pulp firmness had a significantly positive correlation with the expression of ACS 2, ACO 1, CTR 1 / 4, EIN 3 a/b, and EBF 1 / 2 in fruit without chilling injury. This positive correlation was changed to negative one in fruit after storage at 7 °C for 25 days with chilling injury.

40|$|Graduation date: 2012 The United States is {{the third-largest}} {{producer}} of raspberries in the world. Washington State {{leads the nation}} in red raspberry (Rubus idaeus L.) production. 'Meeker', the most grown red raspberry cultivar in the Pacific Northwest (Washington, Oregon and British Columbia, Canada) is highly susceptible to Raspberry crumbly fruit, a virusinduced disease that produces drupelet abortion and reduces fruit quality and yield. The disease has long been attributed to Raspberry bushy dwarf virus (RBDV), a pollen-and-seed transmitted virus found in most commercial raspberry fields around the world. In recent years, an increased severity of crumbly fruit was observed in areas where two additional viruses were common. One of these viruses, Raspberry leaf mottle virus (RLMV), was characterized recently and {{shown to be a}} novel closterovirus transmitted by the large raspberry aphid Amphorophora agathonica Hottes. The second virus, Raspberry latent virus (RpLV) was a tentative member of the family Reoviridae whose characterization remained to be completed. To investigate the role of these two new viruses in the crumbly <b>fruit</b> <b>disorder,</b> 'Meeker' raspberry infected with single or mixtures of the three viruses, in all possible combinations, were generated by graft inoculation. Eight treatments, including a virus free control, were planted in the field at the Northwestern Research and Extension Center in Mt. Vernon, WA. Plant growth and fruit crumbliness were evaluated during establishment and the second year. Simultaneously, the characterization of RpLV, at the genetic and biological level, was completed. RpLV is a novel member of the plant Reoviridae composed of 26, 128 nucleotides divided into 10 genomic dsRNA segments. Analysis of the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (RdRP) indicated that RpLV was related most closely to members of the genus Oryzavirus. However, the genomic terminal regions, conserved at the genus level in reoviruses, did not show homology to those of oryzaviruses, suggesting that RpLV may be a member of a new genus. It was found later, that RpLV was transmitted by A. agathonica. As all other plant reoviruses are transmitted by leaf- and planthoppers, these findings strongly support {{the creation of a new}} genus in the plant Reoviridae for the classification of RpLV. Real-time quantification of viral titers in single or mixed infections revealed that the titer of RBDV was enhanced 400 -fold when the virus was found in coinfections with RLMV. Interestingly, plants co-infected with these two viruses showed significant reduction in plant growth during the establishment and second year. Crumbly fruit was more severe in plants infected with the three viruses compared to the virus-free control. Taken together, this work presents valuable information about the interactions between three important raspberry viruses and their effect on plant growth and fruit crumbliness in 'Meeker', the most important red raspberry cultivar in the Pacific Northwest...|$|R
40|$|Preservation {{of quality}} of apples is a premium target during storage of these fresh products. However, during the {{production}} and storage the fruit can develop undesired quality losses, also during CA (Controlled Atmosphere) storage. ‘Braeburn’ browning disorder (BBD) is such a CA related internal disorder, that cannot be distinguished on the fruit exterior. However, internal disorders are likely to reflect massive changes in the microstructure of the fruit tissue. There {{is a need for}} a non-destructive evaluation of internal fruit quality that is fast, reliable and can be used for on-line sorting of <b>disordered</b> <b>fruits.</b> X-rays can detect local density changes and are therefore investigated as a promising tool to detect brown and hollow tissues in apples. A first objective in {{this study was to investigate}} microstructural changes during development of internal flesh browning of ‘Braeburn’ apples. Therefore apple samples were scanned using high resolution X-ray micro computed tomography, at regular intervals after harvest while storing under extreme CA conditions (1 % O 2, 5 % CO 2). We gained insight in the microstructure by applying image processing tools to virtually isolate single cells and pores, hereby enabling the detailed 3 D characterisation of the in vivo microstructure in terms of the tissue connectivity, the internal air network and the distribution of pores inside the apple tissue in healthy and <b>disordered</b> <b>fruits.</b> Secondly we wanted to investigate the feasibility of X-ray tomography to effectively detect these internal disorders at commercial speeds. We scanned a large number of fruits and performed image processing to detect the disorders. In the first trials we could detect affected fruits with a success ratio of 95 %, although total scans times were rather high (10 minutes per fruit). By significantly lowering the image acquisition time to 38 seconds, the sorting success was reduced to 82 %. Further efforts are needed to speed up the measurements and test the image processing algorithms with newly scanned fruits, however, on-line measurements in a medical CT system have proven the potential applicability of X ray CT in postharvest sorting facilities. status: publishe...|$|R

The aim of this paper was to evaluate the influence calcium and ammonium on the productivity and blossom-end of tomatoes grown hydroponically. The experiment was carried out in the green house of the Department of Agronomy of the Federal Rural University of Pernambuco, and consisted of factorial arrangement between six levels of calcium and two levels of ammonium in the nutrient solution (6 x 2), with six replications in experimental design of randomized blocks. Calcium treatments were the concentrations of 120, 140, 170, 200, 240 and 280 mg L- 1, and ammonium treatments were the absence of this cation in the nutrient solution and the addition of 28. 4 mg L- 1, corresponding to 15 % of total-N of the nutrient solution. The blossom-end rot, productivity, fruit diameter and number of fruits were evaluated. The data were submitted to the analysis of the variance and regression.

USB is a sub-surface spreading grey-brown lesion that may only become evident in the marketplace. RCD is a dark brown discoloration of the finely branched pattern of ramifying sub-surface resin canals. These three browning disorders were compared and contrasted at the cellular level by light microscopy after free-hand sectioning. Discoloured lenticels {{on the surface of}} 2 ̆ 7 Honey Gold 2 ̆ 7 mango fruit typically appeared as small round spots comprised of a dark brown centre surrounded by a white corona.

40|$|Disorders {{occurring}} during long-term {{storage of}} pears can cause economic loss, especially when <b>disordered</b> <b>fruit</b> cannot be distinguished externally from sound fruit. A typical category of <b>disorders</b> in pear <b>fruit</b> {{is related to}} internal browning of the flesh {{and the presence of}} cavities. In this review, information which appeared in the literature in the last decade has been integrated into a generic model for the development of storage-related browning disorders in pear. In this model it is assumed that browning disorders are caused by an imbalance between oxidative and reductive processes due to metabolic gas gradients inside the fruit, leading to an accumulation of reactive oxygen species. The latter may induce loss of membrane integrity which becomes macroscopically visible through the enzymatic oxidation of phenolic compounds to brown coloured polymers. The development of disorders during postharvest ripening and storage of fruit also depends on a range of preharvest factors such as climate conditions and crop load. Methods to evaluate the incidence of browning disorders nondestructively have been reviewed. (c) 2006 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Mature hard {{apples and}} {{processing}} 2. 2 – 2. 4 N itrogen (N) management plays avery {{important role in}} determiningapple yield and quality. For ex-ample, orchard soils with high organic mat-ter content can naturally release a substan-tial amount of N during the summer from the decay of organic matter. With these soils, heavy N fertilization late in the spring coupled with the natural release of N from the soil during the summer can el-evate tree N status to excess levels during the late summer when fruit quality devel-ops. This high tree N status can lead to vig-orous vegetative growth, poor fruit color development, and <b>fruit</b> storage <b>disorders.</b> Vigorous trees are also more susceptible to diseases {{during the growing season}} and freezing damage in the winter. In contrast, lack of N supply on soils with low organic matter can result in small fruit size, low yield, and alternate bearing. Nitrogen Demand-Supply Relationship When developing a nitrogen fertiliza-tion program, the N demand-supply rela-tionship of an apple tree must be taken into consideration. There are three sources of nitrogen supply. First is the nitrogen sup-plied by reserves in the tree that have ac-cumulated during the previous growing season. This pool of nitrogen is readily available for initial tree growth during the spring. The second source is the nitrogen supplied from the soil by the natural min-eralization process. This process can pro-vide a substantial amount of nitrogen for trees growing on soils with high organic matter (Stiles and Reid, 1991). The third source is the nitrogen supplied from fer-tilizers, either applied into the soil or to foliage. Demand for nitrogen is high during the early season when canopy develop-ment and fruit growth both require large amounts of N, but fruit quality at harvest is low from high nitrogen trees.
