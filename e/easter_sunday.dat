6000|$|The Sundays {{were days}} of little rest.

At the same time, the Christian-held islands and possessions around the Aegean Sea were subject to Turkish raids.|$|E
5|$|A plot by {{some members}} of the {{imperial}} government to restore him was discovered in December 947 and the conspirators mutilated and publicly humiliated. Stephen died at Methymna on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday,</b> 963. John Skylitzes claims that Stephen was poisoned by order of the Empress Theophano as part of her efforts to protect the rights to the throne of her sons Basil II and Constantine VIII, by eliminating other possible claimants to the throne. It should, however, be noted that several deaths of the extended imperial family at the time are attributed to Theophano by hostile sources, usually by poison.|$|E

50|$|Before the 1969 {{revision}} of the calendar, the Sundays were called First <b>Sunday</b> after <b>Easter,</b> Second <b>Sunday</b> after <b>Easter,</b> etc. The <b>Sunday</b> preceding {{the feast of the}} Ascension of the Lord was sometimes, though not officially, called Rogation Sunday, and when the Ascension had an octave, the following Sunday was called Sunday within the Octave of the Ascension, but when this octave was abolished in 1955, it was called Sunday after the Ascension. Pentecost was followed by an octave, which some reckoned as part of Eastertide.|$|R

5|$|As the condor's {{population}} {{continued to}} decline, discussion began about starting a captive breeding {{program for the}} birds. Opponents to this plan argued that the condors {{had the right to}} freedom, that capturing all of the condors would change the species' habits forever, and that the cost was too great. However, the project received the approval of the United States government, and the capture of the remaining wild condors was completed on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday</b> 1987, when AC-9, the last wild condor, was captured. At that point, there were only 22 condors in existence, all in captivity.|$|E
5|$|Several of the {{services}} featured in the film were one-off events. For example, the wedding was shot at Lyng, where the bride's father was the rector. The bridegroom, Nigel McCulloch, {{went on to become}} the Bishop of Manchester. The production encountered difficulties with obtaining some footage; while filming a Seaman's Mission from Great Yarmouth, a wave flooded the boat, ruining the sound-recording equipment, and a sequence featuring an open-air service taking place at daybreak on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday</b> at the most easterly point of the UK — at Ness Point, Lowestoft — was nearly missed after the sound recordist overslept.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{reaction}} of Branham's followers {{to his death}} was one of shocking disbelief. In the confusion immediately following his death, expectations developed that he would rise from the dead. His funeral was held on December 29, 1965, but his burial was delayed indefinitely. The press surmised {{that this was a}} result of Branham's expected resurrection. He was finally buried on April 11, 1966, the day after <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday,</b> which was accepted reluctantly by his followers. Most believed {{that he would have to}} return to fulfill a vision that he had regarding future tent meetings.|$|E
50|$|The {{tradition}} of Christmas Midnight Masses, {{the celebration of}} <b>Easter</b> on <b>Sundays,</b> the keeping of a seven-week Lent before Easter and the singing of the Gloria are usually attributed to his pontificate, but some historians doubt that such attributions are accurate.|$|R
50|$|Sunday, {{as the day}} of {{the resurrection}} of Christ, is the {{primordial}} feast day and does not admit other celebrations of rank below that of a solemnity or a feast of the Lord. In Advent, Lent and <b>Easter,</b> <b>Sundays</b> outrank even solemnities. With a very few exceptions, other celebrations are as a rule not to be assigned so that they always fall on a Sunday. The exceptions are the Holy Family of Jesus, Mary, and Joseph, the Baptism of the Lord, Trinity Sunday, the Feast of Christ the King, and, where any of these is not a holy day of obligation, Epiphany, Ascension of the Lord, and the Body and Blood of Christ.|$|R

5|$|After Christmas 1914, {{sporadic}} {{attempts were}} made at seasonal truces; a German unit attempted to leave their trenches under a flag of truce on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday</b> 1915, but were warned off by the British opposite them, {{and later in the}} year, in November, a Saxon unit briefly fraternised with a Liverpool battalion. In December 1915, there were explicit orders by the Allied commanders to forestall any repeat of the previous Christmas truce. Individual units were encouraged to mount raids and harass the enemy line, whilst communicating with the enemy was discouraged by artillery barrages along the front line throughout the day. The prohibition was not completely effective, however, and a small number of brief truces occurred.|$|E
5|$|As in {{his other}} films, von Stroheim used Christian imagery and symbols, such as crosses and churches. Trina first shows signs of greed on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday</b> and is murdered by McTeague on Christmas Eve. Christmas Eve was often {{depicted}} in von Stroheim's films and {{was close to the}} date of his father's death. Lennig asserted that the character of McTeague's father (who was only briefly mentioned in the novel) is based on von Stroheim's own father, while McTeague's mother is a tribute to von Stroheim's mother, to whom Greed is dedicated. Von Stroheim stated that he considered all of his good qualities to have come from his mother and all of his bad qualities to have come from his father.|$|E
5|$|Cagney died at his Dutchess County farm in Stanfordville, New York, on <b>Easter</b> <b>Sunday</b> 1986, {{of a heart}} attack. He was 86 years old.
