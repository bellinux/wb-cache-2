40|$|<b>Felting</b> of <b>wool</b> is {{unwanted}} in {{raw wool}} scouring, wet treatments of most yarns {{and in the}} finished garment. It is desirable in some other uses and essential in the felt industries. The accepted method of testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> is the Aachen felting test but it is laborious and relatively expensive. There is no generally accepted method for testing yarn shrinkage. For these trials new techniques using a household tumble dryer were developed for testing loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Analysis indicated that successful techniques had been developed for measuring loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Results with the loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> technique {{were found to be}} highly correlated with those of the Aachen felting method (r = 0. 93). The effects of fibre characteristics on both loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage were investigated for straight-bred Romneys and for loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> in ¼Merino ¾Romney (QM) crosses. Loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> was most highly correlated with bulk (r = - 0. 65 for Romneys and - 0. 73. for QM's), crimp frequency (r = - 0. 53 and - 0. 41 respectively) and lustre (- 0. 30 and - 0. 40 respectively). Loose wool bulk (r = - 0. 25) and greasy fleece weight (r = - 0. 40) were the most highly correlated to yarn shrinkage. The greasy fleece weight relationship is thought to be environmental in origin. Micron and staple length were found to play only minor roles in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and yarn shrinkage. Cotting was found not to be significantly correlated to either loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage. Loose wool feltability was highly correlated (r = 0. 65) to yarn shrinkage. A large percentage of yarn shrinkage variation was left unexplained. Part of this is probably due to variation in yarn characteristics and {{there is a need for}} a method of producing short-lengths of yarn of constant structure from very small wool samples. The sire effect was significant (P< 0. 05) and controlled 6. 5 % of the variation in loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> and 12 % in yarn shrinkage. This indicates that selection for either increased or decreased loose <b>wool</b> <b>felting</b> or yarn shrinkage would induce changes in a flock. Further investigation into the effect of scale height is warranted to enhance understanding of variation in felting...|$|R

50|$|Hat making was, {{for many}} years, a major {{industry}} in Lancaster and Berks County where Adamstown is located.

5000|$|In the 1800s, {{starting}} {{around the}} time of the Civil War, thrifty homemakers would use scraps of wool or <b>felted</b> <b>wool</b> from old clothing, blankets and hats to create designs for mats or rugs.

Sometimes, the mats or rugs were backed with old burlap bags or feed sacks. Sometimes a penny was stitched inside the mat to make it lie flat.|$|E
40|$|Wool {{has long}} been used by nomadic Mongolian herds-people as a {{cladding}} for their traditional dwellings and as a material for crafting everyday objects. A moldable, lightweight material into which other materials and forms can easily be embedded, <b>wool</b> <b>felt</b> has a distinct aesthetic and an inviting tactile duality. The Felt PET project challenges urban dwellers to see that material/structural innovations and strategic spatial effects can be produced from <b>wool</b> <b>felt.</b> The claddings I propose are designed around common activities and events. They intentionally shift between addressing {{the body and the}} architectural interior spaces the body inhabits. Though handcrafted and idiosyncratic, <b>felting</b> <b>wool</b> can produce claddings whose function and program vary across a continuous surface or landscape. By capitalizing on the enormous potential of wool for producing soft, flexible, portable, innovative, and playful interior environments, I see Felt PET as a viable and critical choice for a contemporary cultural artifact.

50|$|Wool {{has also}} been {{traditionally}} used to cover cloth diapers. Wool fiber exteriors are hydrophobic (repel water) and {{the interior of the}} wool fiber is hygroscopic (attracts water); this makes a wool garment suitable cover for a wet diaper by inhibiting wicking, so outer garments remain dry. Wool felted and treated with lanolin is water resistant, air permeable, and slightly antibacterial, so it resists the buildup of odor. Some modern cloth diapers use <b>felted</b> <b>wool</b> fabric for covers, and there are several modern commercial knitting patterns for wool diaper covers.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinction}} between felted and other fibrous materials {{is not always}} sharp. For example, although truly felted hair on healthy mammals is unusual, many animals, especially in seasonally cold or wet climates or environments, often have a so-called undercoat of down hair plus awn hair that usually lies hidden beneath the outer coat of guard hairs, and may form a mat of lightly <b>felted</b> <b>wool.</b> Such down hairs as a rule are crimped into a finely woolly texture and contain waxy, water-repellent lanolin; in a mass they serve to retain insulating air and exclude water. In many species that live in seasonally frigid zones the winter down hair is shed in clumps during springtime. This is exploited in species such as the muskox; herders collect the wool for commercial purposes without any need for shearing.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, three classifications of wool {{are named}} in the Wool Products Labeling Act of 1939. [...] "Wool" [...] is [...] "the fiber from the fleece of the sheep or lamb or hair of the Angora or Cashmere goat (and may include the {{so-called}} specialty fibers from the hair of the camel, alpaca, llama, and vicuna) which has never been reclaimed from any woven or <b>felted</b> <b>wool</b> product". [...] "Virgin wool" [...] and [...] "new wool" [...] are also {{used to refer to}} such never used wool. There are two categories of recycled wool (also called reclaimed or shoddy wool). [...] "Reprocessed wool" [...] identifies [...] "wool which has been woven or felted into a wool product and subsequently reduced to a fibrous state without having been used by the ultimate consumer". [...] "Reused wool" [...] refers to such wool that has been used by the ultimate consumer.|$|E
50|$|At {{the time}} that George Bollman set up his hat factory in Adamstown, Pennsylvania in 1868, the area was home to many hat makers, due to access to {{plentiful}} water. Hat manufacturing required {{a great deal of}} fresh water to both operate the machinery and to <b>felt</b> <b>wool.</b> Today, manufacturers use other means to power machinery and mills and use water reclamation technology to minimize water usage.

40|$|Durable, {{electrically}} conducting yarns are {{a critical}} component of electronic textiles (e-textiles). Here, such yarns with exceptional wear and wash resistance are realized through dyeing silk from the silkworm Bombyx mori with the conjugated polymer:polyelectrolyte complex PEDOT:PSS. A high Young's modulus of approximately 2 GPa combined with a robust and scalable dyeing process results in up to 40 m long yarns that maintain their bulk electrical conductivity of approximately 14 S cm(- 1) when experiencing repeated bending stress as well as mechanical wear during sewing. Moreover, a high degree of ambient stability is paired with the ability to withstand both machine washing and dry cleaning.
