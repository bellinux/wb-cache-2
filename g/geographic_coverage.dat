5|$|In {{the fifth}} chapter, Stursberg recounts CBC's {{experience}} losing sports licenses. While the CBC had superior market placement (with respect to <b>geographic</b> <b>coverage</b> and experience with amateur sports), {{they lost the}} 2010 and 2012 Olympics to a joint CTV/TSN/Rogers $153 million bid. The Canadian Football League moved its broadcasting rights to TSN with Stursberg citing Commissioner Tom Wright's displeasure with the CBC's poor coverage of CFL games during the CBC 2005 lock-out. The CBC also lost broadcasting rights for The Brier and the Tournament of Hearts to CTV/TSN. Stursberg negotiated for Hockey Night in Canadas NHL rights with Gary Bettman and managed to extend their contract, but at a significantly higher price. The sixth chapter deals with CBC News which, as Stursberg explains, were scheduled to have the local newscasts eliminated. Instead, he initiated style and content reforms, taking effect in October 2009, including {{the creation of an}} internal newswire to provide stories suitable for TV, radio, and web services. He also commissioned an independent study to analyze a perceived anti-conservative bias in news coverage but the study found the coverage to be more conservative friendly than either the Global or CTV coverage. The chapter on Radio noted CBC Radio One's dominance in the Canadian radio market but CBC Radio Two's low ratings. Stursberg advocated for more local radio coverage, especially in the Hamilton area, and facilitated the programming change of CBC Radio Two by inserting more musical variety, specializing in Canadian music.|$|E

Geographic Information Systems (GIS) provide the technology to integrate varying informational needs into a single relational database for ease in data retrieval and analysis. The use of a GIS by the Tillamook Bay National Estuary Project (TBNEP) has developed out of {{a need for more}} efficient utilization of large quantities of spatial information for watershed analysis, ecological modeling, educational and managerial purposes.

The catalog allows the user to identify mapped features and associated metadata information available for these features, in addition to the quality, definitions, and other characteristics of the data in an interactive environment. A potential user is able to peruse the metadata information and render an informed judgment about the fitness of the data for the projected use.

40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{experiments that}} {{were performed to}} understand the <b>geographic</b> and linguistic <b>coverage</b> of web resources focusing on tourism-related themes in Switzerland. The research was prompted by the observation that studies in geographic information retrieval (GIR) and volunteered geographic information (VGI) commonly assume web coverage to be homogenous across geographic space, themes, and languages. There are, however, strong hints that this assumption is unfounded (Pasley et al. 2008). The goal of studying the <b>geographic</b> web <b>coverage</b> {{is one of the}} preliminary steps in generating (geographic) data from the web that can be used as valid information. An idea on how well certain areas are geographically covered by information available on the web, their frequency and patterns that emerge from this data collection help in the decision of preselecting web data for further investigation. For this experiment the language is also considered as coverage varies greatly on the tongue of the place. Ad hoc tourism information is readily available on the web in the form of pages that contain news, lists, catalogue, reviews, blogs and multimedia content. All this provides a vast playground for tourism as a use case for generating geographic information from the web. The key questions driving this research are: 1) What is the geographic distribution of web coverage for tourism-related themes? 2) How does language affect web coverage...|$|R

The implementation provides a comparison of the general model with a similar model which has been frequently cited in the marketing literature. marketing models, sales force planning, mathematical programming application...|$|R
