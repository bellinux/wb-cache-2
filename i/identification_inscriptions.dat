5000|$|The Khorkhor inscription, {{in which}} Argishti I of Urartu records {{the conquest of}} the city of Behoura, records that during the siege the town was {{destroyed}} by an earthquake and eruption of [...] "Mount Bamni". Historians consider it likely that Porak volcano is Mount Bamni and that Behoura was one of the archeological sites in the area. The location of Behoura is controversial, however. The <b>identification</b> of another <b>inscription</b> by Argishti's successor, Sarduri II, gives evidence of another eruption of Porak.|$|R
50|$|Most of {{what has}} been said about Greek {{inscriptions}} applies to Roman also. The commonest materials in this case also are stone, marble and bronze; but a more extensive use is made of stamped bricks and tiles, which are often of historical value as identifying and dating a building or other construction. The same applies to leaden water pipes which frequently bear dates and names of officials. Terracotta lamps also frequently have their makers' names and other information stamped upon them. Arms, and especially shields, sometimes bear the name and corps of their owners. Leaden discs were also used to serve the same purpose as modern <b>identification</b> discs. <b>Inscriptions</b> are also found on sling bullets — Roman as well as Greek; there are also numerous classes of tesserae or tickets of admission to theatres or other shows.|$|R
40|$|The {{dispersal}} and reuse of the spolia of Ostia are {{phenomena that}} have been thoroughly investigated. The novelty of this essay resides in some new hypotheses regarding the extent and {{the dynamics of the}} reuse, which seems to start in late antiquity. The identification of some discriminant criteria (based on typology, onomastics, and formulas) have led to an analysis being carried out on some centers along the Tyrrhenian coast, which in its turn has enabled the <b>identification</b> of <b>inscriptions</b> whose provenance appears to be Ostia or Rome, in the sites of Civitavecchia, Gravisca, Giglio Island, Pisa and some Sardinian locations such as Tergu. What has emerged is a situation wherein the reuse of the spolia from Ostia followed a developmental trajectory that expanded over time and in space, ranging from the first redistribution in late antiquity to the political-religious use made of the spolia in 11 th- 12 th-century Pisa, the surrounding countryside, and the archipelago of islands in its possession...|$|R
50|$|Like the Ushumgal Stele {{and other}} works {{from a similar}} time period, the text on the Blau Monuments is not fully comprehensible. Certain signs are readily identified, while others have no known <b>identification.</b> The obelisk’s <b>inscription</b> clearly refers to ‘5 bur’ of land, {{as well as a}} temple {{household}} and the profession “engar”. This title refers to a high official in an agricultural field, which would suggest the presence of an individual able to undertake such a transaction. The plaque’s text lists commodities of many sorts, as well as several other names and additional undeciphered information. The assumption, then, is that these items were exchanged for the land on the obelisk.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are some}} 350 known Elder Futhark {{inscriptions}} {{with a total}} of approximately 81 known inscriptions from the South (Germany, Austria, Switzerland) and 267 from Scandinavia. The precise numbers are debatable because of some suspected forgeries, and some disputed <b>inscriptions</b> (<b>identification</b> as [...] "runes" [...] vs. accidental scratches, simple ornaments or Latin letters). 133 Scandinavian inscriptions are on bracteates (compared to 2 from the South), and 65 are on runestones (no Southern example is extant). Southern inscriptions are predominantly on fibulae (43, compared to 15 in Scandinavia). The Scandinavian runestones belong to the later period of the Elder Futhark, and initiate the boom of medieval Younger Futhark stones (with some 6,000 surviving examples).|$|R

25|$|The Cippi of Melqart is the {{collective}} name for two Phoenician marble cippi that were unearthed in Malta under undocumented circumstances and dated to the 2nd century BC. These are votive offerings to the god Melqart, and are inscribed in two languages, Ancient Greek and Phoenician, {{and in the}} two corresponding scripts, the Greek and the Phoenician alphabet. They were discovered in the late 17th century, and the <b>identification</b> of their <b>inscription</b> in a letter dated 1694 made them the first Phoenician writing to be identified and published in modern times. Because they present essentially the same text (with some minor differences), the cippi provided {{the key to the}} modern understanding of the Phoenician language. In 1764, the French scholar Jean-Jacques Barthélémy relied on their inscription, which used 17 of the 22 letters of the Phoenician alphabet, to decipher the unknown language.|$|R
40|$|In 1764, British Customs confiscated a book {{containing}} {{hundreds of}} silk samples of different qualities from French agents who {{were attempting to}} sell them illegally in London. The merchant's sample book acquired in 1972 by the V &# 38; A may be this very book, a fascinating record of the eighteenth-century French and English silk industries and their commercial practices. Alongside a full and faithful reproduction of the whole album, Lesley Miller sets in context {{the role of the}} book as a marketing tool from the premier European silk-weaving centre of Lyon and as a model for Spitalfields manufacturers. This publication makes accessible the contents of an extremely rare and fragile object. Translations of French <b>inscriptions,</b> <b>identification</b> of how samples have migrated from one page to another, and technical analysis of some of the silks, as well as a glossary and biographical data on the Lyonnais suppliers make this an invaluable resource for historians, collectors and designers...|$|R
5000|$|The frame has vents on {{the upper}} and lower edge. The upper vents were {{produced}} in two patterns. One using a small brass tube with the inward open end faced slightly forward along the top edge of the frame. The other with a lower profile design that consists of a stamped and soldered channel, curved along the upper edge of the frame with two milled openings, one facing forward and one downward. The frame's lower edge vents are three depressions or three sets of small holes on the flat area of the underside. The two-piece milled bridge acts as a hinge and the larger midsection of the hinge is stamped 'AN 6530'. The manufacturer's <b>identification</b> / <b>inscription</b> can usually be found stamped on the left half of the frame's underside of the Charles Fischer Spring Co. goggles. The American Optical goggles are not identified. Regarding the vents, many collectors believe the tube-type were [...] "early" [...] design and the streamlined vents were [...] "later design". If this is so, why do we see the [...] "later" [...] vents on some forerunner, B-7 goggles? Truth is, both tube-type and streamline-type vents were being produced at the same time! The difference was, Charles Fischer was using his patented streamlined vents in the construction of his B-7s, Navy Mk-II and AN-6530s, while American Optical was using their own tubular design. You can always distinguish a Charles Fischer Spring goggle from an American Optical-made goggle at first glance simply by looking at the vent design. Also on the lower vents, AO used small round pinholes, while Charles Fischer used triangular-shaped stamped vent holes. No such thing as [...] "early tube-type" [...] or [...] "later streamlined vent-type". Both styles were being made at the same time.|$|R
5|$|The {{history of}} the {{putative}} artifact goes back almost a century. The earliest record goes back to a Chinese doctor named Xue Shenwei, who sometime prior to 1928 was shown {{a photo of a}} rubbing of one of the bones by an antiquities dealer named Zhang Yi'an. Although not able to view the bones at that time, Xue Shenwei later acquired one of them from another antiquities dealer named Wang Dongting in 1935 and then the second via a personal connection named Ke Yanling around 1940. While Xue did not recognize the script on the bones he guessed at its antiquity and buried the bones for safekeeping during the Cultural Revolution. Then, in 1983 Xue presented the bones to the Palace Museum in Beijing where Liu Jiuan and Wang Nanfang of the State Administration of Cultural Heritage undertook their study. These officials identified the script as cuneiform and asked the Assyriologists Chi Yang and Wu Yuhong to work on the <b>inscriptions.</b> <b>Identification</b> of the source text proceeded slowly until 1985, when Wu Yuhong along with Oxford Assyriologist Stephanie Dalley and Oliver Gurney recognized the text in one bone as coming from the Cyrus Cylinder. One year later Wu Yuhong presented his findings at the 33rd Rencontre Assyriologique and published them in a journal article.|$|R
5000|$|Following the {{destruction}} of the Koneswaram compound and the Fort of Triquinimale built from its ruins, Trincomalee had a Portuguese force during the reign of Rajasinghe II of Kandy. Constantino de Sá de Noronha who destroyed one of the temples had a copy of the oldest inscription in Tamil Brahmi sent to Portugal for the purpose of <b>identification.</b> The Tamil <b>inscription</b> contains a prophecy on the city and its temple, a copy of which was sent and is retained in The Hague. In a 1638 letter to Dutch Colonial Governor Anthony van Diemen, an officer mentions that Trincomalee is a [...] "fort built rather strongly of hard stones from an old pagoda round the hillock. On each side there is a sandy and rocky bay and it is like a peninsula". Rajasinghe finally formed an alliance with the Dutch, who captured the Fort of Triquinimale in 1639 and handed it to the Kandyans for destruction in 1643. In 1660, the Dutch built the present Fort Fredrick {{at the foot of the}} promontory which they called Pagoda Hill, and another fort at the mouth of the harbour home to Dutch officers, Fort Ostenburg. An English sea captain and his son, the writer named Robert Knox, came ashore by chance near Trincomalee and were captured and held in captivity by the Kandyan king in 1659. The Kandyans then pursued a scorched earth policy to try and oust the Dutch and take Trincomalee and Batticaloa on the east coast. The French set up base in Trincomalee in the Spring of 1672, and tried to make overtures to the Kandyans, but an alliance was not sealed; by July 1672, Trincomalee was retaken by the Dutch fleet.|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe medieval {{inscription}} {{is defined}} as a material writing with the aim of the filling a specific function: guarantee a universal and long-lasting publicity. The importance of the material aspects and the context of the inscription allows speaking about «epigraphic object», a fusion of an objectal dimension and a textual one. Accordingly, the inscriptions can be analyzed as a discourse, which spreads at the same time on the scale of all the epigraphic production, as a genre, and in each of the realizations, unique on principle. The epigraphic discourse uses appropriate linguistic means which answer to its nature and function. In other words, it uses «codes». The codes are common principles of organization of the whole epigraphic discourse; they involve a significant arrangement of language; thanks to them the inscription exists and works as an inscription. Far from external rules stuck on the inscription, they are the condition of possibility of an epigraphic discourse, but mostly remain implicit; they are the manière to express in compliance with the semantic universe created by the inscriptions. Such a conceptual pattern, although matured by the epigraphic practice, must be put to the test of a documentation in which every element is singular by definition. The chosen ground of investigation concerns the inscriptions of Elne. From this documentation, our purpose is not to establish an exhaustive list of linguistic and graphic codes used in the inscriptions, but to ask a series of open questions. How to articulate the notion of discourse with that of code? What are the interactions between linguistic and graphic codes? Do the various codes possess autonomy or do they show a form of solidarity within a given discourse? Are there inscriptions with a lack of one or several code(s) ? Are there inscriptions for which the code does not work? Must the codes be exclusively thought in terms of efficiency or operability? Does the functioning of the codes allow or not certain flexibility? The mobilization of the codes answers not only to the functioning of the inscription in terms of communication, but also to its <b>identification</b> as an <b>inscription.</b> It is because it mobilizes codes that it is considered and used as an inscription. They are thus useful for the writer and for the reader, but their necessity pertains more to pragmatics and aesthetics...|$|R
