40|$|Intrusion {{detection}} systems {{provide additional}} defense capacity to a networked information system {{in addition to}} the security measures provided by the firewalls. This paper proposes an active rule based enhancement to the C 4. 5 algorithm for network intrusion detection in order to detect misuse behaviors of internal attackers through effective classification and decision making in computer networks. This <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 4. 5 algorithm derives a set of classification rules from network audit data and then the generated rules are used to detect network intrusions in a real-time environment. Unlike most existing decision tree based approaches, the spawned rules generated and fired in this work are more effective because the information-theoretic approach minimizes the expected number of tests needed to classify an object and guarantees that a simple (but not necessarily the simplest) tree is found. The main advantage of this proposed algorithm is that the generalization ability of <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 4. 5 decision trees is better than that of C 4. 5 decision trees. We have employed data from the third international knowledge discovery and data mining tools competition (KDDcup’ 99) to train and test the feasibility of this proposed model. By applying the <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 4. 5 algorithm an average detection rate of 93. 28 percent and a false positive rate of 0. 7 percent have respectively been obtained in this work...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies suggest}} that anxious {{individuals}} are more hypervigilant to threat in their environment than nonanxious individuals. In the present event-related potential (ERP) study, we sought to investigate {{the extent to which}} afferent cortical processes, as indexed by the earliest visual component C 1, are biased in observers high in fear of specific objects. In a visual search paradigm, ERPs were measured while spider-fearful participants and controls searched for discrepant objects (e. g. spiders, butterflies, flowers) in visual arrays. Results showed <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 1 amplitudes in response to spatially directed target stimuli in spider-fearful participants only. Furthermore, <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 1 amplitudes were observed in response to all discrepant targets and distractors in spider-fearful compared with non-anxious participants, irrespective of fearful and non-fearful target contents. This pattern of results is in line with theoretical notions of heightened sensory sensitivity (hypervigilance) to external stimuli in high-fearful individuals. Specifically, the findings suggest that fear facilitates afferent cortical processing in the human visual cortex in a non-specific and temporally sustained fashion, when observers search for potential threat cues...|$|R
40|$|Isolated BALB/c mouse thioglycollate-elicited (inflammatory) peritoneal macrophages release {{at least}} 10 times more C 1 q than do {{isolated}} resident peritoneal macrophages. Addition of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) to thioglycollate-elicited macrophages in culture inhibited {{the release of}} C 1 q and reduced levels of C 1 q-specific mRNA. Contrastingly, the NSAID were found to <b>enhance</b> <b>C</b> 1 q-specific mRNA levels in resident macrophages, although no increase in C 1 q levels secreted was observed. This suggests that the response of macrophages to NSAID, with respect to C 1 q synthesis, reflects the developmental stage of the macrophage. The gold salt auranofin (AFN) was found to <b>enhance</b> markedly <b>C</b> 1 q synthesis at both transcriptional and secretory levels in thioglycollate-elicited macrophages whilst, conversely, AFN reduced mRNA levels in resident macrophages. This indicates that AFN and the NSAID may work via the same or similar biochemical pathway, but with opposing effects. The glucocorticoid hydrocortisone (HC) greatly <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> 1 q-specific mRNA levels in both thioglycollate-elicited and resident macrophages, although no parallel increases in C 1 q secreted were observed. The data on inhibition of C 1 q biosynthesis by NSAID in thioglycollate-elicited macrophages are supported by the enhancement of C 1 q biosynthesis following addition of prostaglandin E 2 (PGE 2) or dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dBcAMP) to the cultures. From these experiments, it is concluded that C 1 q biosynthesis is controlled, at least in part, by a pathway involving cAMP...|$|R

40|$|AbstractRecessive {{mutations}} in MEGF 10 {{are known to}} cause a congenital myopathy in humans. Two {{mutations in}} the extracellular EGF-like domains of MEGF 10, C 326 R and C 774 R, were associated with decreased tyrosine phosphorylation of MEGF 10 in vitro.

40|$|Warming-induced {{release of}} CO 2 {{from the large}} carbon (C) stores in arctic soils could {{accelerate}} climate change. However, declines in the response of soil respiration to warming in long-term experiments suggest that microbial activity acclimates to temperature, greatly reducing the potential for <b>enhanced</b> <b>C</b> losses. As reduced respiration rates with time could be equally caused by substrate depletion, evidence for thermal acclimation remains controversial. To overcome this problem, we carried out a cooling experiment with soils from arctic Sweden. If acclimation causes the reduction in soil respiration observed after experimental warming, then it should subsequently {{lead to an increase}} in respiration rates after cooling. We demonstrate that thermal acclimation did not occur following cooling. Rather, during the 90 days after cooling, a further reduction in the soil respiration rate was observed, which was only reversed by extended re-exposure to warmer temperatures. We conclude that over the time scale of a few weeks to months, warming-induced changes in the microbial community in arctic soils will amplify the instantaneous increase in the rates of CO 2 production and thus <b>enhance</b> <b>C</b> losses potentially accelerating the rate of 21 st century climate change...|$|R

40|$|Human {{economic}} activity {{results in the}} release of greenhouse gases, notably carbon dioxide. There is substantive evidence that the increased concentration of some greenhouse gases is affecting the earth’s climate. Using forests to sequester carbon (C) is one strategy for mitigating effects of greenhouse gas emissions. There are many methods in forestry to grow trees and produce wood products, including clearcutting, thinning, fertilizing, burning, and partial cutting. Some of these methods <b>enhance</b> <b>C</b> storage, but generally {{at the expense of}} decreased economic returns for forest owners. The task of this project is to measure the effects of various forest management regimes on forest stand C storage and the economic value of timber harvests in the Oregon Cascades. By comparing changes in stored C and in economic value across difference management regimes, we measure the marginal cost of sequestering C as management regimes are modified to <b>enhance</b> <b>C</b> storage. Data on C balance are obtained using the STANDCARB model for a typical forest stand in north-western Oregon with two species of Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii) and Western hemlock (Tsuga heterophylla). Fifty silvicultural regimes are analyzed, including clearcutting with rotations of 50, 70, 90, 110, 130, and 150.

Here, we assessed the role of labile Cd complexes on Cd uptake by algae, for which diffusion limitations should be less pronounced due to their smaller size. Long-term (3 days) Cd uptake by the green algae Pseudokirchneriella subcapitata was measured in resin buffered solutions with or without synthetic ligands and at three Cd 2 + ion activities (pCd 8. 2 – 5. 7). The free Cd 2 + activity was maintained during the test using a metal-selective resin located in the algal bottles. Total dissolved Cd increased up to 35 -fold by adding the synthetic ligands at constant Cd 2 + activity. In contrast, Cd uptake by algae increased maximally 2. 8 fold with increasing concentration of the synthetic ligands and the availability of the complexes were maximally 5. 2 % relative to Cd 2 + for NTA and CDTA complexes.
