Textural changes are rapid in fish muscle leading to unfavourable quality changes such as muscle softening and fillet gaping. Rapid softening of flesh may be one of the main reasons for underutilization of a wide range of bycatch and discarded fishery species. High proteolytic activity of endogenous muscle proteases, calpains and cathepsins, induces myofibrillar breakdown involved in softening of fish during post-mortem storage. In addition, post-mortem proteolysis of fish myofibrils by <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzymes</b> releases polypeptides and oligopeptides, some of which may demonstrate potential bioactive properties.

The role of somatic cells in dairy processes and products is ill-defined in most studies because the role of these cells combines also the concomitance of physicochemical modifications of milk, bacterial count, and the udder inflammation in the presence of high somatic cell count.

40|$|SUMMARY-Mice {{infected}} with the lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) agent cleared intravenously administered lactic dehydrogenase and isocitric dehydrogenase from the peripheral circulation at a slower rate than normal mice. No difference was found between normal and infected animals {{in the rate of}} clearance of alkaline phosphatase. Carbon tetrachloride, which liberates <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzymes</b> into the circulation by damaging cells, resulted in a more prolonged elevation of lactic dehydrogenase, isocitric dehydrogenase, and malic dehydrogenase in the plasma of infected animals than in normal animals. The onset of impaired enzyme clearance occurred within 13 hours after injection of the LDH agent and persisted for months. The clearance of colloidal carbon particles was also impaired early in the course of infection but returned to normal within 1 week. Evi-dence is discussed which suggests that impaired clearance of normally released <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzymes</b> might be responsible for the increase in plasma enzyme activity following infection with the LDH agent. -J Na...|$|R

Autolysis conditions (viz., temperature, pH and substrate concentration) for preparing protein hydrolysates from the head waste proteins were optimized by response surface methodology (RSM) using a central composite design. Model equation was proposed {{with regard to the}} effect of temperature, pH and substrate concentration. Substrate concentration at 23 % (w/v), pH at 7. 85 and temperature at 50 degrees C were found to be the optimal conditions to obtain a higher degree of hydrolysis close to 45 %.

40|$|AbstractWe {{recently}} reported that muscle contains a trichloroacetic acid-precipitable component having Mr approx. 400 kDa {{that can be}} glucosylated by an <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme</b> acting on UDPglucose. This component contains within itself the autocatalytic, self glucosylating protein glycogenin, the primer for glycogen synthesis. We now report that this substance, to which we give the name proglycogen, is a glycogen-like molecule constituting about 15 % or total glycogen. It acts as a very efficient acceptor of glucose residues added from UDPglucose. Further, that the <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme</b> that adds the glucose to proglycogen is not the autocatalytic protein but a glycogen synthase-like enzyme. Proglycogen may be an intermediate in the synthesis and degradation of macromolecular glycogen and may exist and be metabolized as a separate entity.

40|$|Aims: To compare {{endogenous}} and exogenous β-glucosidases for the hydrolysis of {{the predominant}} isoflavone glucosides in soymilk {{in order to}} improve the biological activity. Methods and Results: β-glucosidase activity of probiotic organisms, including Bifidobacterium animalis ssp. lactis Bb 12, Lactobacillus acidophilus ATCC 4461 and Lactobacillus casei 2607 in soymilk, was evaluated and was related to the increase in the concentration of isoflavone aglycones during fermentation. The concentrations of isoflavone compounds in soymilk were monitored using a Varian model HPLC with an Amperometric electrochemical detector. The aglycone composition, also known as aglycone equivalent ratio, has been considered to be important for the delivery of health benefits of isoflavones, and was monitored during the fermentation of soymilk. Comparison of the hydrolytic effectiveness of both exogenous and <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme</b> during 4 -h incubation in soymilk was conducted using the Otieno-Shah (O-S) index. Results showed that exogenous enzyme exhibited faster rate of isoflavone glucoside hydrolysis than that by <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme.</b> Highest O-S indices were obtained after 4, 3 and 2 h of incubation with enzyme solution having β-glucosidase activity of 0. 288 U ml- 1, 0. 359 U ml - 1 and 0. 575 U ml- 1, resulting into aglycone concentration increments of 5. 87 -, 6. 07 - and 5. 94 -fold, respectively. Conversely, aglycone concentration in the soymilk with B. animalis ssp. lactis Bb 12, L. casei 2607 and L. acidophilus 4461 increased by 3. 43 -, 2. 72 - and 3. 03 -fold, respectively, after 4 h of fermentation at 37 °C. In addition, the O-S index of <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme</b> was much lower than that of the exogenous enzyme over the same 4 -h incubation period. Optimum aglycone equivalent ratios coincided with highest O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations in soymilk hydrolysed with exogenous enzyme. The same correlation of O-S indices and highest aglycone concentrations occurred for <b>endogenous</b> <b>enzyme</b> during the 24 h of fermentation. Conclusions: Obtaining highest aglycone concentration and optimum aglycone equivalent ratio could provide a critical beginning point in clinical trials for the realization of unique health benefits of soy isoflavones. Significance and Impact of the Study: Screening for β-glucosidase activities of probiotics in soymilk and comparing their hydrolytic potentials with that of exogenous β-glucosidase could find wide applications in the development of different aglycone-rich functional soy beverages. © 2007 The Authors. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
