5|$|Approximately half of {{all known}} {{antibiotics}} interfere with the workings of a bacteria's ribosome, a large and complex biochemical machine that performs protein biosynthesis by translating messenger RNA into proteins. Macrolide antibiotics clog the ribosome's <b>exit</b> <b>tunnel,</b> preventing synthesis of essential bacterial proteins. In 2007, the Pande lab received a grant to study and design new antibiotics. In 2008, they used Folding@home to study the interior of this tunnel and how specific molecules may affect it. The full structure of the ribosome was determined only as of 2011, and Folding@home has also simulated ribosomal proteins, as many of their functions remain largely unknown.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century {{some changes}} to Conwy's town walls {{were made in}} order to {{accommodate}} a new railway line and roads. The engineer Thomas Telford built two new gateways into the walls in 1826 to accommodate the traffic from the new suspension bridge across the river Conwy. In 1848 Robert Stephenson constructed the Chester to Holyhead railway line, which ran through Conwy; unusually for the period, attempts were made to sensitively protect the appearance of the medieval fortifications and the entrance for the railway through the walls {{on the south side of}} the town was built in the form of a mock-Gothic archway, while an <b>exit</b> <b>tunnel</b> was dug under the western walls.|$|E
5|$|The {{simulations}} run on Folding@home {{are used}} in conjunction with laboratory experiments, but researchers can use them to study how folding in vitro differs from folding in native cellular environments. This is advantageous in studying aspects of folding, misfolding, and their relationships to disease that are difficult to observe experimentally. For example, in 2011 Folding@home simulated protein folding inside a ribosomal <b>exit</b> <b>tunnel,</b> to help scientists better understand how natural confinement and crowding might influence the folding process. Furthermore, scientists typically employ chemical denaturants to unfold proteins from their stable native state. It is not generally known how the denaturant affects the protein's refolding, {{and it is difficult to}} experimentally determine if these denatured states contain residual structures which may influence folding behavior. In 2010, Folding@home used GPUs to simulate the unfolded states of ProteinL, and predicted its collapse rate in strong agreement with experimental results.|$|E

One night he managed to escape his cell by squeezing through the narrow confines of its window.

One night he was discovered and locked in a concrete box for two weeks. Near death, he was repatriated back to Britain and left Constantinople camp on 1 April 1915. On the two-month journey he contracted malaria once again, surviving the parasite before reaching England via Bulgaria and Greece.|$|E
25|$|NatA {{may also}} {{regulate}} co-translational protein folding and protein targeting to the endoplasmic reticulum, possibly through competition with SRP and NAC {{for the same}} ribosomal binding sites or through yet unknown interference with other ribosome-associated protein biogenesis factors, such as the MetAPs, the chaperones Hsp70/Hsp40, SRP and NAC, which act on newly synthesized proteins {{as soon as they}} emerge from the ribosome <b>exit</b> <b>tunnel.</b> However, the exact mechanism of such action is obscure. Apart from this, Naa15 has been linked to many cellular processes, including the maintenance of a healthy retina, endothelial cell permeability, tumor progression, generation and differentiation of neurons apoptosis and transcriptional regulation; however, it is not well understood whether these are NatA-independent or -dependent functions of Naa15.|$|E

Cicadas live {{underground}} as nymphs for most of their lives at depths down to about [...] Nymphs have strong front legs for digging and excavating chambers in close proximity to roots where they feed on xylem sap.

500|$|The visitors' {{need for}} {{overnight}} lodging led to creation {{of public and}} private campsites and rustic cabins along highways near Cave Junction and the monument. In 1923, the USFS signed a contract with the Oregon Caves Company, based in Grants Pass, to run the cave tours and improve the park accommodations. Public-private partnerships between the USFS or NPS and concessionaires continued in various forms at Oregon Caves into the 21st century. The Chalet, a building with a kitchen, dining room, gift shop, ticket sales area, and a dormitory for women on the Oregon Caves Company staff, was completed later that year. Three years later, the company added seven two-bedroom cabins for tourists and a dormitory for male employees. In 1928, an Oregon Caves bill written by the USFS and introduced by Senator Charles McNary of Oregon won Congressional approval. It provided funds for electric lights, a power plant, a system of pipes and hoses to wash mud from the cave, and an artificial <b>exit</b> <b>tunnel</b> to eliminate the crowding that occurred when two groups on round-trip tours had to pass one another.
