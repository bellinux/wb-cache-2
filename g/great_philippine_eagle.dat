50|$|The Philippine eagle (Pithecophaga jefferyi), {{also known}} as the monkey-eating eagle or <b>great</b> <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle,</b> is an eagle of the family Accipitridae endemic to forests in the Philippines. It has brown and white-coloured plumage, and a shaggy crest, and {{generally}} measures 86 to 102 cm in length and weighs 4.7 to 8.0 kg. It is considered the largest of the extant eagles in {{the world in terms of}} length and wing surface, with the Steller's sea eagle and the harpy eagle being larger in terms of weight and bulk. Among the rarest and most powerful birds in the world, it has been declared the Philippine national bird. It is critically endangered, mainly due to massive loss of habitat resulting from deforestation in most of its range. Killing a Philippine eagle is punishable under Philippine law by 12 years in prison and heavy fines.|$|E

50|$|Life {{expectancy}} for a wild eagle {{is estimated}} to be from 30 to 60 years. A captive <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> lived for 41 years in Rome Zoo, and it was already adult when it arrived at the zoo.

50|$|The mascot of the 2005 Southeast Asian Games is a <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> named Gilas (Skill/Might). The <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> {{is one of}} the world's largest eagles, {{distinct}} for its majestic plumage on its head. The eagle is {{a symbol}} of elegance, strength and pride and winning spirit of the athletes. Gilas was inspired by the Filipino words Maliksi (agile), Malakas (strong), Matalino (smart), Mataas (high), and Matalas (sharp). The SEA Games mascot was originally a Philippine tarsier until the Philippine SEA Games Organising Committee (PhilSOC) changed it to the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle.</b> The SEA Games mascot Gilas was designed by Filipino sportswriter/columnist Danny Simon.|$|R

5000|$|Pag-asa was hatched at 10:40 pm PST on January 15, 1992 at the <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> Center in Barangay Malagos at the Calinan {{district}} in Davao City {{and was the}} first of its kind to be successfully bred and hatched in captivity. It weighed 134.6 grams at its birth. Pag-asa was bred through artificial insemination and was hatched through combined artificial and natural incubation technique taught by the World Center For Birds of Prey. The animal was the first offspring of <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagles</b> Diola and Junior. Then 29-year-old Diola, laid the egg of Pag-asa and Junior found in Agusan, was the sperm donor. Pag-asa was named by the breeding team of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> Conservation Program Foundation Public led by executive director Dennis Salvador and camp manager Domingo Tanada for Tagalog term for [...] "hope". Awareness on conservation efforts on the endangered <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagles</b> increased after the birth of Pag-asa.|$|R
50|$|The {{complete}} breeding {{cycle of}} the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> lasts two years. The female matures sexually at five {{years of age and}} the male at seven. Like most <b>eagles,</b> the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> is monogamous. Once paired, a couple remains together {{for the rest of their}} lives. If one dies, the remaining eagle often searches for a new mate to replace the one lost.|$|R
50|$|The {{national}} bird, {{known as}} the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> has the longest body of any eagle.|$|R
50|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> {{was known}} {{initially}} as the <b>Philippine</b> monkey-eating <b>eagle</b> {{because it was}} believed to feed on monkeys (the only monkey native to the Philippines is the Philippine long-tailed macaque) almost exclusively; this {{has proven to be}} inaccurate. This may be because the first examined specimen was found to have undigested pieces of a monkey in its stomach. Like most predators, the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> is an opportunist that takes prey based on its local level of abundance and ease. It is the apex predator in its range.|$|R

40|$|The <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> Pithecophaga jefferyi is a diurnal raptor {{endemic to}} the Philippines. Its {{distribution}} {{is restricted to}} remaining forests on the islands of Luzon, Samar, Leyte and Mindanao. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> is classified as a Critically Endangered species under the IUCN Red List, with a high end estimated population of only 500 breeding pairs in the wild. Population decline {{has been attributed to}} continuing deforestation, particularly since the mid- 1900 s, and hunting. This study aimed to identify the effects of population decline on the genetic structure of the present population of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> by sequencing 1132 bp of the mitochondrial control region from 22 individuals. Control region haplotype diversity (h = 0. 8960 ± 0. 05590) and nucleotide diversity (π = 0. 006194 ± 0. 003372) are comparable with other accipitrid species. Maximum likelihood trees and network analysis show that the Luzon and Samar individuals come from different lineages, but both shared a common ancestral population with the Mindanao population. The genetic diversity, multimodal mismatch distribution for the control region and high frequency of lower class modes all indicate a recent bottleneck for the <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> population. Possible strategies for conservation are discussed...|$|R

5000|$|The 500 ha Forest Wildlife Park, at Sinai, Brgy. Salasang, is nestled {{with old}} trees and wild {{animals such as}} the <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle,</b> Kalaw, etc.|$|R
50|$|They are {{threatened}} primarily by deforestation through logging and expanding agriculture. Old-growth forest is being lost {{at a high}} rate, {{and most of the}} forest in the lowlands is owned by logging companies. Mining, pollution, exposure to pesticides that affect breeding, and poaching are also major threats. Additionally, they are occasionally caught in traps laid by local people for deer. Though this is no longer a major problem, the eagle's numbers were also reduced by being captured for zoos. The diminishing numbers of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> were first brought to international attention in 1965 by the noted Filipino ornithologist Dioscoro S Rabor, {{and the director of the}} Parks and Wildlife Office, Jesus A Alvarez. Charles Lindbergh, best known for crossing the Atlantic alone and without stopping in 1927, was fascinated by this eagle. As a representative of the World Wildlife Fund, Lindbergh traveled to the Philippines several times between 1969 and 1972, where he helped persuade the government to protect the eagle. In 1969, the Monkey-eating Eagle Conservation Program was started to help preserve this species. In 1992, the first <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagles</b> were hatched in captivity through artificial insemination; however, not until 1999 was the first naturally bred eaglet hatched. The first captive-bred bird to be released in the wild, Kabayan, was released in 2004 on Mindanao; however, he was accidentally electrocuted in January 2005. Another eagle, Kagsabua, was released 6 March 2008, but was shot and eaten by a farmer. In June 2015 an eagle was released after being treated for a gunshot wound, two months later it was shot and killed. Killing this critically endangered species is punishable under Philippine law by twelve years in jail and heavy fines.Its numbers have slowly dwindled over the decades to the current population of 180 to 600 eagles. A series of floods and mud slides, caused by deforestation, further devastated the remaining population. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> may soon no longer be found in the wild, unless direct intervention is taken. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> Foundation in Davao City, Philippines is one organization dedicated to the protection and conservation of the <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagle</b> and its forest habitat. The <b>Philippine</b> <b>Eagle</b> Foundation has successfully bred <b>Philippine</b> <b>eagles</b> in captivity for over a decade and conducted the first experimental release of a captive-bred eagle to the wild. The foundation has thirty-six eagles at its center, of which nineteen were bred in captivity, including one born in 2015; the first for two years.|$|R
