50|$|Like the {{previous}} Mallet locomotive, these five had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> <b>bar</b> frames and used saturated steam. They differed little from {{the previous}} Mallet, basically only in respect of their larger boilers which made them slightly heavier and their tenders with a 1 lt 10 lcwt t larger coal capacity.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} had Heusinger-Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> <b>bar</b> {{frames and}} were superheated. They had round-topped fireboxes, unlike the earlier Modified Fairlie locomotives which had Belpaire fireboxes. They were fitted with the Parry soot-blower which enabled the boiler tubes {{to be cleaned}} during running conditions. Reversing was effected from the driver's cab by Hendrie's steam reversers. Provision was made for steam to either engine unit to be cut off in emergencies.|$|E
50|$|In 1928, the SAR placed two Class GH {{passenger}} train versions of its Class U Union Garratt in service, {{designed and built}} by Maffei, to work the named fast {{passenger train}}s of the era, the Union Express and Union Limited, forerunners of the Blue Train. They were superheated and had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> <b>bar</b> frames and mechanical stokers. They made several trips working the two Union trains out of Cape Town, {{but they were not}} as successful as had been hoped and they were soon taken off that duty. Their mechanical stokers also proved to be troublesome and were eventually removed. Both remained in service until 1958.|$|E

40|$|The {{title for}} this project is Development of Attachment for Customized Steering Rack on One Seater Drag Buggy. This project is under the UMP Mechanical Faculty. The main target {{for this project}} to the final year project student is to design, {{fabricate}} and analysis the customized mechanical part at the steering system of this buggy. This is {{to achieve the objective}} which is the steering system for the buggy is function without any problem. The steering system is very important to a vehicle to control and to navigate the vehicle movement direction. The system used mechanical principle to transfer the rotation from the steering wheel to the wheel through the steer rack that consist mechanical part such as pinion <b>gear,</b> <b>bar</b> gear and shaft. The analysis of the part is very important to gain the information on the maximum stress, minimum stress, load, FOS and the application of each material used to withstand the load. This buggy is design to roll at extreme terrain such as off-road and mud. The fabrication of the customized part and attachment of the part must be done properly to withstand the environment used of this vehicle.

25|$|The H class {{also became}} the first VR {{locomotive}} to feature a mechanical stoker, and boasted many other modern features such as roller bearings, hydrostatically controlled load compensating brake gear on the tender, power-operated reversing <b>gear,</b> American-style <b>bar</b> frame construction, thermic siphons, and duplex blast pipes.|$|R
50|$|The NGR 2-6-6-0 Mallet {{locomotive}} had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> a <b>bar</b> {{frame and}} used saturated steam.

25|$|In total, {{there are}} eight coaxial {{spindles}} of various nested sizes to transfer the rotations in the mechanism to the eight pointers. So in all, there are 30 original gears, seven gears added to complete calendar functionality, 17 gears, and three slotted bars to support the six new pointers, for {{a grand total of}} 54 <b>gears,</b> three <b>bars,</b> and eight pointers in Freeth and Jones' design.|$|R
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were superheated and had round-topped fireboxes, Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and <b>bar</b> frames. To {{enable the}} longest boiler possible without increasing the overall {{length of the}} locomotive, the front engine unit was tucked in underneath the boiler frame somewhat further than was usual on a purebred Garratt locomotive. An additional underbelly water tank compensated for the resulting diminished water capacity of the front water bunker.|$|R

The locomotive had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> a <b>bar</b> frame and used saturated steam. At the time it was the most powerful locomotive in the country. In 1912, when it was assimilated into the SAR, it was designated Class MA.|$|R
5000|$|In 1929, five Class GDA Garratts entered branchline service.

5000|$|In 1927, the SAR placed ten Class HF Modified Fairlie Double Mikados in service, {{followed}} by an eleventh one in 1928. The locomotive was designed by the SAR {{under the direction of}} Colonel F.R. Collins DSO, SAR Chief Mechanical Engineer from 1922 to 1929, and was built by Henschel & Son in 1926 and 1927, hence the designation of Class HF for [...] "Henschel Fairlie". Designed for mainline work, it was the Modified Fairlie equivalent of the Class GE Garratt which was similar in both size and mechanical respects. It had Walschaerts valve <b>gear,</b> a <b>bar</b> frame and was superheated, with a round-topped firebox.|$|R

50|$|Like the Class 19, the Class 19A {{also had}} Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and a <b>bar</b> frame. Col F.R. Collins DSO, Chief Mechanical Engineer (CME) of the South African Railways (SAR) at the time, {{redesigned}} the Class 19 {{to achieve a}} lighter axle loading by reducing the coupled wheel diameters from 54 to 51 in, reducing the cylinder diameter from 21 to 19+1/2 in and by using a slightly smaller boiler.|$|R
50|$|This is {{the final}} design for the compressor/exhauster sets from the late 1950s. They {{are made up of}} an in-line {{arrangement}} (from left to right) of an 8,000 horsepower steam turbine, then two low-pressure compressors, a high-pressure exhauster, a 27MW 11kV synchronous motor that provided 36,000 horsepower, and finally the <b>barring</b> <b>gear</b> and the exciter (a small generator that provides a current needed to start the main motor).|$|R
25|$|The {{locomotive}} {{was greatly}} improved from the Class NG G11, with trailing wheels added to each engine unit, outside bar frames instead of plate frames, round-topped fireboxes instead of Belpaire fireboxes, and larger dimensions in most respects except the grate area. They were superheated and sported an extremely compact arrangement of Walschaerts valve <b>gear</b> and outside <b>bar</b> frames. The leading wheels were arranged as conventional pony trucks, while the inner carrying wheels were built to the Gölsdorf system which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|R

5000|$|The first barring engines or <b>barring</b> <b>gear</b> were manual. At their simplest, {{they were}} a hefty {{engineer}} with a crowbar (hence the term [...] "barring"). The engine's flywheel could be provided {{with a series of}} holes or teeth and a roller fulcrum set into the frame at a convenient place. Later manual <b>barring</b> engines had <b>geared</b> drives and a crank handle. With suitable reduction gears, even very large engines could be barred by hand. This only needed to be done once a day and was not a hurried operation, so speed was not crucial.|$|R
30|$|Our {{device is}} a {{significant}} improvement over other portable devices {{reported in the literature}} (Table  1) because it achieves two seemingly incompatible targets simultaneously; lighter weight and higher torque output. The device is especially effective when sampling a large number of cores and/or large-diameter cores at forests that are easily accessible by car. When sampling cores for wood quality research, we were able to increase the sample throughput by more than three times compared to the manual procedures, and also eliminate severe muscular exertion by the operator. Our device also enables researchers, especially smaller persons and females, to obtain long- and large-diameter cores that typically were not feasible by manual coring. The basic configuration of our device consists of the large <b>gear,</b> reaction <b>bar</b> and socket. Based on common prices in 2017, devices capable of sampling 5  mm and 12  mm cores may cost about 700, 000 and 800, 000 Japanese yen, respectively.|$|R

Tests were conducted with spur <b>gears</b> and rolling-contact <b>bars</b> manufactured from VIM-VAR M 50 NiL and VAR and VIM-VAR AISI 9310. The gear pitch diameter was 8. 9 cm (3. 5 in.). Gear test conditions were an inlet oil temperature of 320 K (116 F), and outlet oil temperature of 350 K (170 F), a maximum Hertz stress of 1. 71 GPa (248 ksi), and a speed of 10, 000 rpm. Bench rolling-element fatigue tests were conducted at ambient temperatures with a bar speed of 12, 500 rpm and a maximum Hertz stress of 4. 83 GPA (700 ksi). The VIM-VAR M 50 NiL gears had a surface fatigue life that was 4. 5 and 11. 5 times that for VIM-VAR and VAR AISI 9310 gears, respectively. The surface fatigue life of the VIM-VAR M 50 NiL rolling-contact bars was 13. 2 and 21. 6 times that for the VIM-VAR and VAR AISI 9310, respectively.

2500|$|<b>Barring</b> <b>gear</b> (or [...] "turning gear") is the {{mechanism}} provided to rotate the turbine generator shaft {{at a very}} low speed after unit stoppages. Once the unit is [...] "tripped" [...] (i.e., the steam inlet valve is closed), the turbine coasts down towards standstill. When it stops completely, {{there is a tendency}} for the turbine shaft to deflect or bend if allowed to remain in one position too long. This is because the heat inside the turbine casing tends to concentrate in {{the top half of the}} casing, making the top half portion of the shaft hotter than the bottom half. The shaft therefore could warp or bend by millionths of inches.|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} part of a larger project to develop a (kinetic) theory of carpal motion based on {{computationally}} derived isometric constraints. Three-dimensional models were created from computed tomography scans of the wrists of ten normal subjects and carpal spatial relationships at physiological motion extremes were assessed. Specific points on the surface of the various carpal bones and the radius that remained isometric through range of movement were identified. Analysis of the isometric constraints and intercarpal motion suggests that the carpus functions as a stable central column (lunate–capitate–hamate–trapezoid–trapezium) with a supporting lateral column (scaphoid), which behaves as a ‘two <b>gear</b> four <b>bar</b> linkage’. The triquetrum functions as an ulnar translation restraint, as well as controlling lunate flexion. The ‘trapezoid’-shaped trapezoid places the trapezium anterior to the transverse plane of the radius and ulna, and thus rotates the principal axis of the central column to correspond to that used in the ‘dart thrower’s motion’. This study presents a forward kinematic analysis of the carpus that provides the basis for the development of a unifying kinetic theory of wrist motion based on isometric constraints and rules-based motion.

50|$|Neutral argon atoms bind very weakly {{to other}} neutral atoms or {{molecules}} to form van der Waals molecules. These {{can be made}} by expanding argon under high pressure mixed with the atoms of another element. The expansion happens through a tiny hole into a vacuum, and results in cooling to temperatures a few degrees above absolute zero. At higher temperatures the atoms will be too energetic to stay together by way of the weak London dispersion forces. The atoms that are to combine with argon can be produced by evaporation with a laser or alternatively by an electric discharge.

The major components of the machine include; centrifugal pump, dc motor, sprockets, chain drive, spur <b>gears</b> and angle <b>bar.</b> Testing the pump showed that it has a flow rate of 14 litres per minute during manual operation and 24 litres per minute during operation with the dc motor...|$|R
40|$|University of Minnesota M. S. thesis. August 2010. Major: Biosystems and {{agricultural}} Engineering. Advisor: Dr. Jonathan Chaplin. 1 computer file (PDF); xiv, 189 pages, appendices A-C. Ill. (some col.) This research investigated bearing failures in a spur <b>gear</b> cutter <b>bar</b> {{used in the}} agricultural equipment sector for cutting forage crops. The cutter bar is under consideration by Case-New Holland (CNH) for use in their equipment. The primary focus {{of this investigation was}} to develop and test a real time monitoring system to monitor the health of the bearings during operation and alert the operator of the location of a pending bearing failure. This system uses temperature as the monitoring parameter and does not estimate the remaining useful life after the initial failure mode has been detected. The temperature profile of interest is that just before catastrophic failure and based on that is used to alert the operator. Causes of bearing failure within the cutter bar are also investigated theoretically to determine the effect that they would have on bearing life. Both cutter bar bending and bearing misalignment were analyzed from a theoretical perspective. Bending of the cutter bar was determined to not have a detrimental effect on the contact stresses within the bearings and thus no shortening of bearing life. Bearing alignment is a critical factor in bearing condition as excessive misalignment creates high contact stresses reducing the useful life. The gear train and bearings are retained between two steel halves creating a case, and to prevent excessive misalignment the case halves cannot shift by more than 0. 47 ± 0. 04 mm relative to the vertical axis of each bearing mount. Additional testing determined that operating the cutter bar on a hill has no effect on bearing life and that oil temperature can be used to monitor the correct amount of oil in the cutter bar...|$|R
5000|$|A {{number of}} {{different}} methods were employed. The most common was phlebotomy, or venesection (often called [...] "breathing a vein"), in which blood was drawn from {{one or more of}} the larger external veins, such as those in the forearm or neck. In arteriotomy, an artery was punctured, although generally only in the temples. In scarification (not to be confused with scarification, a method of body modification), the [...] "superficial" [...] vessels were attacked, often using a syringe, a spring-loaded lancet, or a glass cup that contained heated air, producing a vacuum within (see fire cupping). There was also a specific bloodletting tool called a scarificator, used primarily in 19th century medicine. It has a spring-loaded mechanism with gears that snaps the blades out through slits in the front cover and back in, in a circular motion. The case is cast brass, and the mechanism and blades steel.
