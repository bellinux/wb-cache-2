Finlayson's 2009 book on Neanderthals and their interaction with Homo sapiens expands on the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> were the same species since modern man contains genetic sequences that are shared with neanderthals and the possibility of interbreeding is likely. However, Finlayson discusses that because these shared genetic sequences are common across the globe then it is possible that these shared genes are due to our common heritage in Africa.|$|E

[...] According to Hahn, [...] "When we first pitched the revised outline of the movie ... someone in the room announced that its themes and relationships were similar to Hamlet.

In the rough draft of this version, Mulder would have been sent to Moscow. Carter, instead, assigned Morgan and Wong the task of writing the season opener. Before working on The X-Files, Morgan had written a script with the same name about a man who goes to a telescope located in Chile. The script was never made, but Morgan liked various elements of it, so he cannibalized parts for [...] "Little Green Men". In addition, the episode was specifically written for Mulder to question himself and his beliefs.

But I think now people are writing and saying, 'Oh yeah!'

We probably wrote 24, 25 songs {{over the course of}} a couple of months. Marker commented that [...] "the business stuff ends up taking over some of that fun. We got really bogged down in people's expectations of what we were supposed to be doing, being on bigger record labels and stuff.

500|$|Glenn Erickson {{discussed}} Danger: Diabolik {{twice on}} DVD Talk (in 1998 and 2005); describing {{the film as}} a guilty pleasure, he praised Bava's stylized visuals, noting his use of bright colours, elaborate sets and wide lenses, [...] "giving almost every shot a distorted depth that lends the film a consistent comic book dynamism". While noting the minimal characterization of Diabolik himself (describing him as [...] "the final distillation of the <b>idea</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> love criminals because we secretly admire the transgressions they represent"), he felt that Marisa Mell's portrayal of Eva presented her as loving Diabolik [...] "on a romantic plane of surprising believability. [...] adoring faithfulness is so physical and pure that the sincerity of their farewell ("You'll not be alone while I live!") is tenderly affecting." [...] Erickson also admired Terry-Thomas' campy portrayal of the Minister of Interior, describing his news conference as [...] "easily outdo TV's Batman." [...] Thematically, he has noted that Diabolik's desire to steal for himself and Eva [...] "represent the ultimate end of materialist consumerism", as well as [...] "the rollercoaster Italian politics of the time, which seemed to flip-flop from conservative to socialist and back again on a weekly basis;" [...] Erickson also mentions that [...] "Diabolik's world stresses strangely fetishistic surfaces and textures, backing up film theorist Raymond Durgnat's assertion that the psychic land of pulp fantasy is fundamentally a sexual one." ...|$|E
