Packaging is the one part of product that can attract the consumer or influence the consumer buying decision. Through packaging, costumer will know about the information of product and company through the label on packaging and packaging can show the visual beauty of the product. Product that has a good package design can add value to product itself. The {{aim of this study}} is to examine the effects of package design aesthetics on female consumer buying decision of Vaseline lotions with particular emphasis on these variables: package color, instructions, typography and material. This research used quantitative method. The analytical method used was multiple linier regression analysis. The data used in this research is primary data obtain through the questionnaire. The population observed is student female of Sam Ratulangi University who using Vaseline Lotion with sample as many as 100 respondents. Result and conclusions are from all variables of package design aesthetics (Color, Instructions, Typography, and Material), not all aesthetic package design elements has a significant influence on consumer buying <b>decision.</b> <b>Instruction</b> has no significant influence and color is the most influencing variable.

40|$|In recent years, {{numerous}} studies comparing intuition and deliberation have been published. However, relatively {{little is known}} about the cognitive processes underlying the two decision modes. In two studies, we analyzed the effects of <b>decision</b> mode <b>instructions</b> on processes of information search and integration, using eye-tracking technology in a between-participants (Study 1) and a within-participants (Study 2) design. Our findings indicate that the instruction to deliberate does not necessarily lead to qualitatively different information processing compared to the instruction to decide intuitively. We found no difference in mean fixation duration and the distribution of short, medium and long fixations. Short fixations in particular prevailed under both <b>decision</b> mode <b>instructions,</b> while long fixations indicating a conscious and calculation-based information processing were rarely observed. Instruction-induced deliberation led to a higher number of fixations, a more complete information search and more repeated information inspections. We interpret our findings as support for the hypothesis that intuitive and deliberate decision modes share the same basic processes which are supplemented by additional operations in the deliberate decision mode.

The absence of standards in certain areas and the lack of critical mass to effectively drive such standards is currently one of the identified barriers to widespread adoption of smart components by industry.

40|$|Ruigrok’s thesis {{refers to}} the burgomaster’s competences to {{immediately}} enforce public order pursuant to the Dutch Municipalities Act and his power to take a <b>decision</b> containing an <b>instruction</b> under the threat of enforcement action. The form and execution of these two competence systems are very similar; {{in both cases the}} unwritten restorative measure (bevel) or decision (last) is physically executed. Over the past decades immediate enforcement of public order by the burgomaster evidently shows a trend toward juridification. Restorative measures to immediately enforce public order are put down in writing nearly by default. For example several days prior to soccer games, demonstrations or public events unwritten emergency restorative measures will be issued in writing. Such unwritten restorative measures thus have become an order within the meaning of the General Administrative Law Act, {{as is the case with}} <b>decisions</b> containing an <b>instruction</b> under the threat of enforcement action. Burgomasters occasionally force themselves to try to comply with the requirements of a regular order within the meaning of the General Administrative Law Act. The development of the law in this context is striking in view of Article 5 : 23 Awb, whereas in this provision the legislator ensures rapid and decisive action in order to enforce public order. With her research Ruigrok has formed a soundly based judgment of the trend regarding the juridification of immediate enforcement of public order, bearing in mind its large impact. She has also determined the situations in which a <b>decision</b> containing an <b>instruction</b> under the threat of enforcement action - and thus a <b>decision</b> containing an <b>instruction</b> under the threat of an astreinte - offers an alternative to the competences to immediately enforce public order...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a novel idea in teaching computer architecture by using programmable hardware. Current teaching models for computer architecture today are either mostly theory-only or implementation oriented. Theory-based architecture courses lack the feedback to show students {{the effects of}} their <b>decisions.</b> Implementation-oriented <b>instruction</b> emphasizes the implementation aspects, that is, very low-level implementation strategies, over CPU architecture and forces the usage of very limited CPU designs to reduce complexity. High cost and long manufacturing times are other problems associated with this approach. We propose to use field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) to allow fast implementation of chip designs. This allows for a fast debug cycle, as designs can be altered and downloaded {{in a matter of}} hours. As FPGAs are pretested, only logic functionality has to be validated, reducing the time to get a workable implementation of a chip considerably. 1 Introduction Current compu [...] ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the motives of aerobics parti-cipants in relation to their perceived and preferred leadership behavior of aerobic instructors. Eighty seven aerobics participants (aged between 16 – 59 y) completed the cross-sectional questionnaire survey.

We found that in aerobics participants the appearance- and health-related dimensions of exercise motivation are higher ranked than flexibility and social motives. Although aerobics participants show relatively high levels of competitive and social motives compared with general population, the highest ranked incentive for them seems to be physical fitness. Aerobics participants perceive significantly less instructors ʼ democratic <b>decision</b> making, <b>instruction,</b> social support and positive feedback than they prefer, while they perceive signi-ficantly higher amount of autocratic decision making compared with their preference.

40|$|Sather is an {{object-oriented}} language recently designed and implemented at the International Computer Science Institute in Berkeley. It compiles into C and {{is intended to}} allow development of object-oriented, reusable software while retaining C's efficiency and portability. We investigate to what extent these goals were met through a comparative performance study and analysis of Sather and C programs on a RISC machine. Several language design decisions in Sather are motivated by the goal of efficient compilation to standard architectures. We evaluate the reasoning behind these <b>decisions,</b> using <b>instruction</b> set usage statistics, cache simulations, and other data collected by instrumented Sather-generated code. We conclude that while Sather users still pay a moderate overhead for programming convenience (in both run time and memory usage) the overall CPU and memory usage profiles of Sather programs are virtually identical to those of comparable C programs. Our analysis also shows that ea [...] ...|$|R
