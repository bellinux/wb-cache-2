5|$|Raynor is {{only ever}} {{depicted}} by his unit portrait {{through the course}} of StarCraft and Brood War. He is later shown in StarCraft II as a physically strong yet casually dressed character, wearing his combat gear over his normal clothes, which are further described in the novels as well-worn and rough in appearance. Raynor has a neatly trimmed moustache and beard, which by the time of StarCraft II are beginning to grey. His StarCraft II model also reveals the presence of tattoos on both <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>In</b> addition, a number of pieces of concept art depict Raynor smoking. Unlike other characters, Raynor isn't seen wearing a uniform at any point during the series, with the rare exceptions of when he is encased in marine combat armour. Raynor is often depicted riding a modified vulture hovercycle, which he uses for transport and in open land combat.|$|E

25|$|While still a {{young man}} he was {{attacked}} by a young yakuza wielding a bokken. Having developed strong abilities in striking based arts he felt hesitant to use these skills against his young assailant for fear of gravely injuring him and so blocked strike after strike on his arms eventually scaring his attacker away without retaliating. Having injured <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> this altercation {{he began to feel}} the limitations of arts which relied predominantly upon striking.|$|E
25|$|The sons of Louis VIII and Blanche of Castile used golden castles {{on a red}} {{background}} (derived {{from the}} arms of Castile) as charges to difference their arms: for Robert, a label; for Alphonse, a semy of castles; for Charles, a bordure. This initial system of differencing was dropped {{in favor of a}} longer-lasting simpler system. Charles, the youngest son of Louis VIII, changed <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> favor of the arms of France with a plain label gules.|$|E
25|$|When Hafs, son of Umar ibn Hafsun, finally {{laid down}} <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> 928 and {{surrendered}} {{the town of}} Bobastro, Abd-al-Rahman III imposed the Islamic system of civil organisation in Mālaqa province. This allowed a new population distribution that encouraged urban development {{and the proliferation of}} farms in rural areas, as opposed to the pattern of feudalism dominant in the rest of Europe. The farmers practiced intensive irrigation-based agriculture, while artisanry and trade flourished in the cities—leading to prosperity and an era of peace in the province.|$|E

25|$|Commerford is {{also known}} for his {{numerous}} tattoos. His first tattoo was a solid black band around his left arm to remember his mother by. He soon had half of a face (a painting by graphic artist Mirko Ilić) tattooed on his back, and various other designs on <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>In</b> 1993, he began work on an intricate design on his left leg. By 1996 this tattoo covered over 65% of his body (covering his arms, left leg, chest, back, and two swirls on his posterior).|$|E
25|$|This marble obelisk {{is on top}} of {{a square}} base with three reliefs on it. The south side of the base has a relief of Benjamin Grenup {{at the time of his}} death. The relief shows Grenup being run over by a fire water wagon and his fellow firefighters {{reacting}} to the accidental death—one has <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> the air while the other firefighters stop the wagon. The west side of the base has a relief of a fire hose and two nozzles. The east side has a relief of a fire axe, torch and spanner wrench tied together with a rope. Egg-and-dart motif along with garland and ribbons decorate the sculpture. The sculpture sits on a triangle plot surrounded by a fence. Fire hydrants sit at each of the three corners of the base.|$|E
25|$|The royal arms of Scotland was the {{official}} {{coat of arms}} of the King of Scots first adopted in the 12th century. With the Union of the Crowns in 1603, James VI inherited the thrones of England and Ireland and thus <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> Scotland were now quartered with the arms of England (which was itself quartered with France) with an additional quarter for Ireland also added (the arms would continue to alter in later years). Though the kingdoms of England and Scotland would share the same monarch, the distinction in heraldry used in both kingdoms was maintained. When the kingdoms of Scotland and England were united under the Acts of Union 1707 to form the United Kingdom of Great Britain, no single arms were created and instead, the royal arms as used in either Scotland {{and the rest of}} the United Kingdom would continue to differ.|$|E

25|$|Games 4 and 5 {{were the}} most {{controversial}} of the series. The Spurs, after being comfortably in control of game 4, saw their 11-point fourth quarter lead dwindle away, to a 2-point Suns lead. With 18 seconds left, Robert Horry bodychecked Steve Nash in which he threw <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> the air, into the scorers table. Nash's teammates jumped to his defense; during the ensuing altercation, Stoudemire and Boris Diaw left the bench heading toward the altercation. Their action violated NBA rules, resulting in the decision by league commissioner David Stern to suspend both players for game 5 (Horry was also suspended two games for his flagrant foul against Nash). In game 5, played in Phoenix, the short-handed Suns jumped out early and enjoyed a 16-point lead on the Spurs, but in a reversal of game 4, this time the Spurs came back {{in the final seconds}} and won the game 88–85, giving San Antonio a 3–2 series lead.|$|E
25|$|In rounds {{seven and}} eight, Hagler's southpaw jab was landing solidly and Leonard's counter flurries were less frequent. Round nine {{was the most}} {{exciting}} round of the fight. Hagler hurt Leonard with a left cross and pinned him in a corner. Leonard was in trouble, then furiously tried to fight {{his way out of}} the corner. The action see-sawed back and forth for the rest of the round, with each man having his moments. Round ten was tame by comparison, as the pace slowed after the furious action of the previous round. Clearly tiring, Leonard boxed well in the eleventh. Every time Hagler scored, Leonard came back with something flashier, if not as effective. In the final round, Hagler continued to chase Leonard. He hit Leonard with a big left hand and backed him into a corner. Leonard responded with a flurry and danced away with Hagler in pursuit. The fight ended with Hagler and Leonard exchanging along the ropes. Hagler began dancing in celebration of his performance while Leonard alternately collapsed to the canvas and raised both <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> triumph. Leonard threw 629 punches and landed 306, while Hagler threw 792 and landed 291.|$|E

500|$|... "Male-parallel" [...] mating {{involves}} {{the male and}} female swimming side by side. The male will then raise one or two of his arm pair I upwards and swing them back and forth. He moves below the female and clasps the female's neck with <b>his</b> <b>arms.</b> <b>In</b> contrast to the previous behaviours, in this position the male actually inserts his hectoctylus into the mantle cavity of the female, attaching the spermatophores right {{at the opening of the}} oviduct rather than at the mouth. Possibly for this reason, it is usually more successful in fertilizing the female than other mating behaviours.|$|E
500|$|The 11th century Ledberg {{stone in}} Sweden, {{similarly}} to Thorwald's Cross, features a figure {{with his foot}} {{at the mouth of}} a four-legged beast, and this may also be a depiction of Odin being devoured by Fenrir at Ragnarök. Below the beast and the man is a depiction of a legless, helmeted man, with <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> a prostrate position. The Younger Futhark inscription on the stone bears a commonly seen memorial dedication, but is followed by an encoded runic sequence that has been described as [...] "mysterious," [...] and [...] "an interesting magic formula which is known from all over the ancient Norse world." ...|$|E
500|$|After the sailboat, Larson's pattern play {{became more}} accurate, as {{he hit his}} target squares each time he spun. Tomarken was {{increasingly}} astounded that Larson was still spinning despite not having seen a Whammy for so long. Larson continued to press on, passing more and more milestone markers without losing any of his four remaining spins. As he passed the $40,000, $50,000, and $60,000 marks, Tomarken virtually begged Larson to stop more than once, fearing he would hit a Whammy. [...] Larson finally decided to stop once he reached $102,851.

[...] He also takes trips to different locales around the world. [...] In the end, the man leaves the city for the woods, raises <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> praise of nature, and dies.

500|$|AD 8 saw the {{collapse}} of the rebel position in Pannonia: a rebel commander, Bato the Breucian, surrendered their leader Pinnes to the Romans and laid down <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> return for amnesty from the Romans. Bato the Breucian was left in charge of his people and some additional Pannonians. This was a significant event in the war, considering the large population and resources of the Breuci, who were able to supply the Roman army with eight cohorts alone {{toward the end of the}} conflict. Bato the Breucian was himself defeated in battle and subsequently executed by his former ally Bato the Daesitiate. As a result of the surrender of Pinnes and the death of Bato the Breucian, the Pannonians were divided against each other, and the Romans attacked, and conquered the Breuci without battle. Bato the Daesitiate withdrew from Pannonia to Dalmatia, where he occupied the mountains of Bosnia and began conducting counter-attacks, most likely against the indigenous people who sided with the Romans. Later in the year, Tiberius left Lepidus in command of Siscia and Silvanus at Sirmium.|$|E
500|$|Brown scored against Rangers in a Scottish Cup tie at Ibrox on 6 February 2011, {{which earned}} Celtic a replay. Brown and El Hadji Diouf, {{who had played}} {{directly}} against each other on Celtic's right wing, had exchanged words {{throughout much of the}} game. After scoring his goal, Brown turned to Diouf and raised <b>his</b> <b>arms</b> <b>in</b> a taunting celebration, he was booked for this. After the match they continued their feud in the media the next day. Two days after the match, Brown then stated that he considered their altercations to be [...] "just a bit of banter" [...] which he regularly encountered on the pitch and that the yellow card he received for his celebration was the best of his life. Several days later, Lennon publicly stated he wanted to agree a new contract with Brown. In the lead up to the replay of the Scottish Cup match, Rangers player Kyle Bartley said that not many Rangers players liked Brown and that they would be targeting him in the next game.|$|E
