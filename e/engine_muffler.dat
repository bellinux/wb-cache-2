40|$|Abstract — The main aim of our {{research}} is to design a Muffler for four stroke diesel <b>engine.</b> <b>Muffler</b> is a device which is used for {{reducing the amount of}} noise emitted by the exhaust of an internal combustion engine. In this research baffle arrangement are used to resist the flow of the exhaust from the engine. An exhaust pipe must be carefully designed to carry toxic and/or noxious gases away from the users of the machine. Indoor generators and furnaces can quickly fill an enclosed space with carbon monoxide or other poisonous exhaust gases if they are not properly vented to the outdoors. Also, the gases from most types of machine are very hot; the pipe must be heat resistant and it must not pass through or near anything that can burn or damaged by the heat. A chimney serves as an exhaust pipe in a stationary structure. For the internal combustion engin...|$|E

40|$|The muffler is {{the main}} part of the Automobile Exhaust System, {{consisting}} of fibrous and porous materials to absorb noise and vibrations. The exhaust gas mass coming from the engine can produce resonance, which may be the source of fatigue failure in the exhaust pipe due to the presence of continuous resonance. The modes on the muffler should be located away from the engine’s operating frequencies in order to minimise the resonance. The objective of this paper is to determine the frequencies that appear at the modes, which have the more adverse effect during the operation of the automobile. An impact test has been conducted by applying the force using a hard head hammer, and data generated have been used for plotting a graph of the transfer functions using MATLAB. Six points have been selected, namely 1, 2, 3, 4, 7, and 11 on the muffler for the impact test. The collected data from theses six points have been analysed for the addition of damping. Results suggests that increasing the mass increases the damping and lowers the modes of the transfer function. Further research will identify higher strength materials that can withstand the higher gas temperatures as well as the corrosion and erosion by the gas emitted from the <b>engine.</b> <b>muffler,</b> noise, vibration,modal analysis...|$|E

40|$|Increasing noise {{complaints}} are recorded from residential areas surrounding small airfields in Germany. As a consequence the German Ministry of Transport, Building and Housing set in force noise related traffic regulations for General Aviation (GA) aircraft, which were meant as an {{impetus for the}} aircraft operators to realize available noise reduction technologies. These regulations (German "Landeplatz-Lärmschutzverordnung") impose operational restrictions - at leisure times in particular - for aircraft without a noise certificate and for aircraft with noise levels which do not fall 4 to 7 dB below their relevant (Chapters 6 to 10) noise certification level. Exceptions are granted for cross-country flights. The philosophy of this regulation is to reduce noise originating from the most annoying circuit flights of training aircraft but not hamper GA-aircraft business operations. Seeking for a non restricted operation, therefore each individual aircraft type needs a noise certificate to establish its compliance with the required noise limits. This turns out as a hardship for older aircraft, which only comply with former - less stringent - noise limits, or which even {{do not have a}} noise certificate at all (if they got their airworthiness certificate before 1971). Such aircraft need an adequate retrofitting with low-noise propellers or <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>mufflers.</b> The respective technology has been developed in recent years, coming up with multiblade propellers, geared <b>engines</b> and innovative <b>muffler</b> designs. Based on the knowledge of respective noise reduction potentials the adequate technical solution (and the ensuing cost/benefit relation) has to be determined for each one aircraft type individually...|$|R
40|$|Break-out {{noise from}} the shell often puts a limit on the (net) {{transmission}} loss that {{can be obtained from}} an <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>muffler.</b> One of the best ways of reducing break-out noise is use of a sandwich plate shell. This short paper presents an analytical model for prediction of transverse transmission loss of sandwich plate shells. Four-pole parameters of the porous layer are used along with an impedance approach for relating radial velocity of the outer (exposed) metallic layer to acoustic pressure of a plane progressive wave inside the muffler shell. This is combined with radiation impedance for outgoing cylindrical waves to predict transverse transmission loss. Thus, a sandwich plate shell is compared with a single layer shell without and with wrapping of another metallic layer by means of a transverse insertion loss. Finally, results of a parametric study are reported to help the muffler designers...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is to demonstrate the homogenization approach applied to modelling the acoustic transmission on perforated interfaces embedded in the acoustic fluid. We assume a layer, with periodically perforated obstacles, separating two half-spaces filled with the fluid. The homogenization method provides limit transmission conditions which can be prescribed at the homogenized surface representing the "limit" interface. The conditions describe relationship between jump of the acoustic pressures and the transversal acoustic velocity, on introducing the "in-layer pressure" which describes wave propagation in the tangent directions {{with respect to the}} interface. This approach may serve as a relevant tool for optimal design of devices aimed at attenuation of the acoustic waves, such as the <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>mufflers</b> or other structures fitted with sieves and grillages. We present numerical examples of wave propagation in a muffler-like structure illustrating viability of the approach when complex 3 D geometries of the interface perforation are considered...|$|R
50|$|Mufflers are {{installed}} within the exhaust system of most internal combustion <b>engines,</b> although the <b>muffler</b> is {{not designed to}} serve any primary exhaust function. The muffler is engineered as an acoustic soundproofing device designed to reduce the loudness of the sound pressure created by the engine by way of acoustic quieting. The majority of the sound pressure produced by the engine is emanated {{out of the vehicle}} via the same piping used by the silent exhaust gases. The emitted noise is abated by a series of passages and chambers lined with roving fiberglass insulation and/or resonating chambers harmonically tuned to cause destructive interference, wherein opposite sound waves cancel each other out.|$|R
3000|$|To {{address the}} problem of low {{frequency}} noise of the internal combustion <b>engine,</b> several existing <b>muffler</b> design methods, such as the theory of the quarter-wavelength tube and the Helmholtz muffler, were examined and compared.

An example is carried out to illustrate the analysis of original signal, the design of the new muffler and the improvement of the in-car noise. The transmission loss of the new muffler is studied by theoretical method and finite element method. The vehicle test of the new muffler demonstrates excellent performance with a wider noise elimination frequency band and smaller radial size.|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} {{to determine the}} noise reduction potential of the 0 - 2 airplane {{in order to reduce}} its aural detection distance.

Detection distance for the modified aircraft is estimated to be reduced from about 4 - 1 / 4 miles to about 1 - 1 / 2 miles when the aircraft is operating at an altitude of 1, 000 ft over grassy terrain. Reducing the altitude to 300 ft over a leafy jungle ground cover should reduce the aural detection distance to 0. 9 miles. Reduced aural detection distances were also indicated for a modification utilizing a direct-drive six-blade propeller of reduced radius along with smaller exhaust mufflers...|$|R
40|$|A {{study was}} {{undertaken}} by the NASA Langley Research Center to determine the noise reduction potential of the U- 10 airplane {{in order to reduce}} its aural detection distance. Static and flyover noise measurements were made to document the basic airplane noise signature. Two modifications to the airplane configuration are suggested as having the best potential for substantially reducing aural detection distance with small penalty to airplane performance or stability and control. These modifications include changing the present 3 -blade propeller to a 5 -blade propeller, changing the propeller diameter, and changing the propeller gear ratio, along with the use of an <b>engine</b> exhaust <b>muffler.</b> The aural detection distance corresponding to normal cruising flight at an altitude of 1, 000 ft over grassy terrain is reduced from 28, 000 ft (5. 3 miles) to about 50 percent of that value for modification 1, and to about 25 percent for modification 2. For the aircraft operating at an altitude of 300 ft, the analysis indicates that relatively straightforward modifications could reduce the aural detection distance to approximately 0. 9 mile. Operation of the aircraft at greatly reduced engine speed (1650 rpm) with a 1. 3 -cu-ft muffler provides aural detection distances slightly lower than modification 1...|$|R

40|$|Virtually all {{reciprocating}} {{internal combustion}} engines are fitted with mufflers. The muffler fitted to an engine {{is intended to}} reduce the pressure pulses associated with the exhaust gas leaving the cylinders of the <b>engine.</b> Generally <b>mufflers</b> fitted to such engines are essentially reactive devices {{as opposed to being}} dissipative devices. The aim of this research is to develop a computational fluid dynamics (CFO) model to predict the acoustic and mean flow performance of reactive mufflers used with large diesel engines for agriculture, mining, transport and marine applications. Currently such mufflers are designed on a simplified theoretical and/or empirical basis. Consequently the design is generally conservative and so it results in weight and cost penalties. The basis of the CFD acoustic modelling approach is to apply a pulse of suitable amplitude and duration at the inlet of the muffler. The time dependent CFD model determines flow variables associated with the resulting perturbation at the outlet of the muffler. The inlet and outlet pressure time histories derived from the CFD analysis can be Fourier transformed to allow the frequency-dependent transmission loss of the muffler to be found. The acoustic pulse can also be superimposed on a steady flow at the inlet and the resulting perturbation superimposed on the steady flow at the outlet can be determined. Thus the frequency-dependent transmission loss for the acoustic with mean flow performance of the muffler can be found. This CFD modelling approach is used to predict the performance of various types of reactive mufflers and the CFD models are validated against laboratory and published results of full-scale silencers...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} reduce {{aircraft}} noise emissions at airfields, this paper investigates that potential of noise reduction which can be achieved for piston-engine propelled General Aviation aircraft {{in accordance with the}} state of the art by retrofitting them with low-noise propellers and <b>engine</b> auxiliary <b>mufflers.</b> For this purpose, using an airplane equipped with a common 147 kW driving engine as an example, a low-noise propeller and an auxiliary muffler are designed to reduce engine exhaust noise. As compared to a 2 -bladed reference propeller, the propeller diameter is reduced for noise abatement. To maintain aerodynamic efficiency, one uses more blades with optimized airfoil sections and lift distribution. The new design does not exhibit any performance penalties in cruise flight. At lower airspeeds, however, thrust losses have to be accepted. Because of the reference of this study to the regulations of noise certification, noise levels and level reductions are indicated in the form of the A-weighted total noise level. As a result one expects an A-weighted propeller noise level which is by 12. 4 dB lower as compared to the reference propeller. To exploit this reduction potential, the required reduction of the A-weighted engine exhaust noise was determined to be 9 dB by noise measurements on the engine test rig. Preliminary design calculations for optimal design of a resonance muffler show that a corresponding insertion loss will be reached without any significant performance losses.
