50|$|By modifying {{these values}} while {{monitoring}} the exhausts using a wide band lambda probe {{to see if}} the <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> <b>rich</b> or lean, the tuner can find the optimal amount of fuel to inject to the engine at every different combination of RPM and throttle position. This process is often carried out at a dynamometer, giving the tuner a controlled environment to work in. An engine dynamometer gives a more precise calibration for racing applications. Tuners often utilize a chassis dynamometer for street and other high performance applications.|$|E
50|$|The {{catalyst}} {{requires that}} the fuel/air mixture is stoichiometric. This means that the mixture is neither rich or lean, it is exactly 14,7 kg air to 1 kg gasoline (Lambda=1). That is why the system is equipped with an oxygen sensor in the forward part of the exhaust system. The sensor is connected to pin 23 in the ECU and {{is grounded in the}} ECU via pin 47. The exhaust fumes pass the oxygen sensor. The content of oxygen in the exhaust fumes is measured through a chemical reaction, this results in an output voltage. If the <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> <b>rich</b> (Lambda lower than 1) the output voltage would be more than 0.45 V and if the engine runs lean (Lambda higher than 1) the output voltage would be less than 0.45 V. The output voltage swings about 0.45 V when Lambda passes 1. The ECU continuously corrects the injection duration so that Lambda=1 is always met. To be able to function the oxygen sensor needs to be hot, this requirement is meet by electrically pre heat the sensor. The pre heating element is fed by B+ via fuse 38 and the main relay, the sensor is grounded in the ECU via pin 50. The ECU estimates the temperature on the exhaust gases (EGT) {{on the basis of the}} engine load and the engines RPM. At high EGT the electrical pre heating is disconnected. The lambda correction is masked during the engines first 640 revolutions after start if the coolant temperature exceeds 18℃ (64F) at load ranges over idle and under WOT or 32℃ (90F) at idle.|$|E
40|$|International audienceLean NOx trap (LNT) and Selective Catalytic Reduction {{catalysts}} (SCR) are {{two leading}} candidates for Diesel NOx after-treatment. Each technology exhibits good properties to reduce efficiently Diesel NOx emissions {{in order to}} match the forthcoming EURO 6 standards. NOx reduction in LNT is made through a two-step process. In normal (lean) mode, Diesel engine exhausts NOx is stored into the NOx trap; then when necessary the <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> <b>rich</b> during limited time to treat the stored NOx. This operating mode has the benefit of using onboard fuel as NOx reducer. But NOx trap solution is restrained by limited active temperature windows. On the other hand, NH 3 -SCR catalysts operate in {{a wider range of}} temperature and do not contain precious metals. However, NH 3 -SCR systems traditionally use urea-water solution as reducing agent, requiring thus additional infrastructure to supply the vehicles with enough reducer. These pros and cons are quite restrictive in classical LNT or NH 3 -SCR architecture. The present paper presents an after-treatment architecture combining a NOx trap and a passive NH 3 -SCR. Synergy of the two systems is possible if the SCR takes advantage of the LNT ability to produce Ammonia (NH 3). Indeed, during the rich phases (purges), small amounts of Ammonia are formed as by-product, which can be used in the downstream catalyst as the NOx reducing agent. A major difficulty to operate the proposed architecture is the real-time management of the NOx purge: for future control and diagnosis applications, it is crucial to have accurate but low-complexity models. A complete reduced model of the physicochemical phenomena involved is proposed in the present paper. Based on simplified chemical assumptions and time scale separation, the latter is suitable for on-board diagnostics and model-based control. Validation has been achieved through extensive experiments...|$|E
40|$|Emissions {{from modern}} SI-engines are reduced by a three way {{catalyst}}. However {{if there are}} leaks in the exhaust system before the catalyst emissions increase for two reasons. First the untreated emissions leak out. Second which is worse, due to waves in the exhaust system, oxygen leaks into the manifold and causes an oxygen sensor offset. The result is increased emissions as the air/fuel controller makes the <b>engine</b> <b>run</b> <b>rich.</b> Here a method to detect leakages in the exhaust manifold is presented. The sensors used are binary oxygen sensor(s), intake manifold pressure and temperature, and the air mass flow sensor. Injection time {{is also used to}} estimate air/fuel ratio. Experimental results are shown with measurements from a turbo charged SAAB SI production engine with wastegate...|$|R
5000|$|Built-up {{carbon in}} the {{ignition}} chamber can glow red after the engine is off, providing a mechanism for igniting unburnt fuel. Such a thing can happen when the <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> very <b>rich,</b> depositing unspent fuel and particles on the pistons and valves. Similarly, rough metal regions within the piston chamber can cause this same problem, since they can glow red. It has also been suggested that an improperly rated spark plug can retain heat and cause the same problem.|$|R
5000|$|In {{an example}} of the {{classical}} approach, Pirsig explains to the reader that one must pay continual attention: when the Narrator and his friends came into Miles City, Montana he notices that the [...] "engine idle is loping a little," [...] a possible indication that the fuel/air mixture is too rich. The next day he is thinking of this as he is going through his ritual to adjust the valves on his cycle's engine. During the adjustment, he notes that both spark plugs are black, confirming a rich mixture. He recognizes that the higher elevation is causing the <b>engine</b> to <b>run</b> <b>rich.</b> The narrator rectifies this by installing new jets with the valves adjusted, and the <b>engine</b> <b>runs</b> well again.|$|R
5000|$|Tampering with or {{modifying the}} signal that the oxygen sensor sends to the engine {{computer}} can be detrimental to emissions control and can even damage the vehicle. When the engine is under low-load conditions (such as when accelerating very gently, or maintaining a constant speed), it is operating in [...] "closed-loop mode". This refers to a feedback loop between the ECU and the oxygen sensor(s) in which the ECU adjusts the quantity of fuel and expects to see a resulting change in {{the response of the}} oxygen sensor. This loop forces the engine to operate both slightly lean and slightly rich on successive loops, as it attempts to maintain a mostly stoichiometric ratio on average. If modifications cause the <b>engine</b> to <b>run</b> moderately lean, there will be a slight increase in fuel economy, sometimes at the expense of increased NOx emissions, much higher exhaust gas temperatures, and sometimes a slight increase in power that can quickly turn into misfires and a drastic loss of power, as well as potential engine and catalytic converter (due to the misfires) damage, at ultra-lean air-fuel ratios. If modifications cause the <b>engine</b> to <b>run</b> <b>rich,</b> then there will be a slight increase in power to a point (after which the engine starts flooding from too much unburned fuel), but at the cost of decreased fuel economy, and an increase in unburned hydrocarbons in the exhaust which causes overheating of the catalytic converter. Prolonged operation at rich mixtures can cause catastrophic failure of the catalytic converter (see backfire). The ECU also controls the spark engine timing along with the fuel injector pulse width, so modifications which alter the engine to operate either too lean or too rich may result in inefficient fuel consumption whenever fuel is ignited too soon or too late in the combustion cycle.|$|R
50|$|Missile 8E on January 24, 1961 lost {{roll control}} due to {{aerodynamic}} heating shorting the vernier pitch control servo, {{a problem that}} had not occurred since the early Atlas A tests. Missile 9E on February 4 experienced problems with the propellant utilization system and prematurely depleted its fuel supply, however the warhead landed {{only a few miles}} short of the target, so the flight was considered a success. Missile 13E (March 14) experienced a similar problem, but with a much earlier sustainer cutoff and the warhead missed its target by almost 2000 miles. Missile 16E (March 25) depleted its supply of helium control gas early, making it impossible to jettison the booster section. The missile was dragged down by the weight of the spent booster engines and fell short of its intended range, also the propellant utilization system malfunctioned again and caused the <b>engines</b> to <b>run</b> fuel <b>rich.</b> The failure was traced to two mistakenly transposed wires which caused spurious venting of the control helium out the vernier engines.|$|R

40|$|Contemporary {{research}} into {{alternative sources of}} energy for transportation focuses mainly on electric/battery, hybrid and hydrogen powered vehicles. Such focus assumes that the current technology has to be discarded and cannot be improved. However, {{it is possible to}} introduce interim technology to alleviate the current challenges arising from continued reliance on fossil fuels. Such challenges include increased greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions with consequent global warming and climate change impacts. The purpose of this research work is to determine if the partial inclusion of hydrogen gas (HHO) in a petrol fuelled spark ignition (SI) internal combustion (IC) engine would improve engine performance. If this is possible, old SI technology can be modified to reduce GHG emissions and improve utilisation of fossil fuels which are expected to dominate the transport energy source {{for at least the next}} half century. An HHO generator was designed, constructed and mounted in the engine compartment of a 1989 Ford Laser vehicle. This system allowed partial inclusion of HHO gas on demand into the combustion process through the air supply stream. Detailed and comprehensive experimental investigations were conducted for engine speeds ranging from 1000 to 3500 rpm while parameters such as the power output, exhaust gas emissions and fuel consumption were monitored. Results obtained indicated a decrease in hydrocarbon emissions and an increase in power output with an increase in the HHO gas for certain engine operating conditions. However, performance improvement cannot be claimed for all operating conditions, especially under higher loads where the <b>engine</b> <b>ran</b> with a <b>rich</b> fuel mixture. Hence, further work is required, through HHO generator refinement alongside better engine management, to improve the experimental performance and hence further understanding of this technology...|$|R
