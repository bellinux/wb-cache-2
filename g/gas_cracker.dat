50|$|A <b>gas</b> <b>cracker</b> is any {{device that}} splits the {{molecules}} in a gas or liquid, usually by electrolysis, into atoms. The end product {{is usually a}} gas. A hydrocracker {{is an example of}} a <b>gas</b> <b>cracker.</b> In nature, molecules are split often, such as in food digestion and microbial digestion activity. A <b>gas</b> <b>cracker</b> device splits the molecule at a rate much greater than that normally found in nature. In science and industry, gas crackers are used to separate two or more elements in a molecule. For example, liquid water, or , is separated into hydrogen and oxygen gases.|$|E

For ultimate decomposition of gas into elements more than 1500 °C is required. Thus, acetylene/carbon black production encounters such high temperatures.

40|$|SiGe is a {{promising}} material for channel or contact applications {{because of its}} high hole and electron mobility and capacity for both compressive and tensile strain by integration with Ge-rich and Si-rich layers. The high hole mobility of SiGe can be used for p-channel FET as an alternative to Si. The larger lattice constant of SiGe compared to Si can provide tensile or compressive stress into the Si channel thereby enhancing the electron or hole mobility, respectively. Moreover, the multi-gate structure, which utilizes multiple crystalline planes such as (001) and (110) can be employed to overcome the challenges such as SCEs resulting from single-gate MOS devices. 	In this work, cleaning, passivation, and functionalization of SiGe(001) and (110) surfaces were developed and studied using in-situ XPS, STM, and STS. XPS was utilized to understand the chemical compositions, oxidation states, and thickness of thin films on SiGe(001) and (110) surfaces. STM was used to study the topological structures and bonding configurations on the surfaces. STS was performed to probe the electronic structures such as pinning or unpinning effects by characterizing the density of states. 	In order to avoid the oxygen and carbon contaminations after ex-situ native oxide removal, a combined wet and dry cleaning was performed. Wet in-situ HF clean method was successful to remove native oxides on SiGe(001) and contained no oxygen. Dry clean of atomic H via a thermal <b>gas</b> <b>cracker</b> method was found to be effective to remove the residual carbon contaminations. Sputter-cleaned SiGe(001) surface was terminated with only Ge dimers while SiGe (110) surface was terminated with both Si and Ge adtoms verified by STM. H 2 O 2 (g) was employed to passivate the SiGe surfaces and provide a high nucleation density for the metal ALD process confirmed by XPS. TMA was dosed onto the hydroxyl terminated SiGe surfaces to form a monolayer of Al 2 O 3. TDMAT or TiCl 4 was also exposed onto the hydroxyl terminated SiGe surfaces to form a monolayer of TiOx. Al atoms were bonded to one oxygen atom while Ti atoms were bonded to two oxygen atoms on the surfaces studied by STM and XPS. Furthermore, PDA resulted in the formation of selective Si-O-Al or Si-O-Ti on SiGe(001) and (110) surfaces...|$|E

Das PKA-Pyrolyseverfahren ist durch folgende Verfahrensschritte gekennzeichnet: -Aufbereitung der Einsatzstoffe auf die fuer den Prozess erforderliche Koernung und Aushaltung ferromagnetischer Bestandteile - Pyrolyseanlage zur thermischen Behandlung der Einsatzstoffe und Spaltung in die Produkte Pyrolysereststoff sowie Pyrolyserohgas in der indirekt beheizten Pyrolysetrommel bei ca. 550 C -Crackung der im Pyrolyserohgas enthaltenen Kohlenwasserstoffe bei Temperaturen von 110 bis 1200 C - Gasreinigung, bestehend aus einer mehrstufigen Gaswaesche, Trockenentschwefelung und Aktivkoksfilter. Durch ein umfangreiches Probenahme-, Mess- und Analysenprogramm wurden die Verfahrensschritte Pyrolyse und Gascrackung und das Gesamtverfahren untersucht. Auf dieser Grundlage sind Aussagen zur Stoff- und Energiebilanzierung, zur Schadstoffreduzierung und zu Emissionen moeglich. Die Ergebnisse dienen als Basis fuer die Projektierung von thermischen Entsorgungsanlagen. Weiterhin wurden wertvolle Erkenntnisse zu Verbesserungen der Gascrackung und Staubabscheidung aus dem Spaltgas gewonnen. So wurde der Gascracker mit Steinkohlenkoksbefuellung durch eine kokslose Technologie ersetzt und der Staub im Spaltgas mit einem Schlauchfilter abgeschieden. Auf Grund der Variabilitaet der stofflichen Zusammensetzung der Einsatzstoffe sind auch die Bilanzergebnisse sehr unterschiedlich. Bei allen Einsatzstoffen wurde eine starke Reduzierung der Massen und Volumina der festen Reststoffe erreicht und ein energetisch verwertbares Reingas produziert. Die Verwertung der Pyrolysereststoffe durch Hochtemperaturvergasung ist nicht Gegenstand dieses Foerderprojektes. (orig.) Within the {{framework}} of this sponsored project, the following materials were pyrolysed at the pyrolysis plant operated by DBI Rohstoff- und Anlagentechnik GmbH for research purposes at Freiberg: PAH-contaminated wood, shredded car parts, aluminium-containing plastic waste, used carpets, and paint shop wastes. The PKA pyrolysis technique {{is characterized by the}} following process steps: conditioning of materials to the grain size required for the process and elimination of ferromagnetic components, pyrolysis for thermal treatment and for breaking a material up into the products pyrolysis residue and crude pyrolysis gas in an indirectly heated pyrolysis drum at approximately 550 C, cracking of hydrocarbons contained in the crude pyrolysis gas at temperatures between 110 and 1200 C, and flue gas cleaning by means of of multi-stage gas scrubbing, dry desulfurization and activated coke filters. In a comprehensive sampling, measuring and analysis program, the process steps pyrolysis and gas cracking and the overall process were investigated. On this basis statements can be made regarding material and energy budgets, pollutant control, and emissions. The results serve as a basis for the planning of thermal disposal plants. Furthermore, valuable knowledge was obtained on how to enhance gas cracking and dust precipitation from the cracked gas. Thus, the <b>gas</b> <b>cracker</b> with hard-coal-coke filling was replaced by a cokeless unit, and dust in the cracked gas was precipitated by means of a tube filter. On account of the variability of composition of the materials used, budgeting results vary greatly, too. For all materials used, the mass and volume of solid residues could be substantially reduced; the clean gas produced can be used as an energy source. Processing of the pyrolysis residues by high-temperature gasification is not the object of this research project. (orig.)
