40|$|Eurostat and the <b>European</b> National <b>Statistical</b> Institutes (NSIs) need {{to provide}} {{detailed}} high-quality data on all relevant aspects (economic, social, demographic, environmental) of modern societies. Moreover, the quality declaration of the <b>European</b> <b>Statistical</b> System (ESS) states that continuously improving a programme of harmonized European statistics {{is one of the}} major objectives of the ESS. Given the differences among the existing national statistical systems, the development of new approaches aiming at standardizing the statistical production processes for improving the quality of statistics and for a successful harmonization is essential. In particular, one of the two main purposes of the “European Statistics Code of Practice”, adopted by the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Programme</b> Committee on 24 February 2005, is: “To promote the application of best international statistical principles, methods and practices by all producers of European Statistics in order to enhance their quality”. In this framework, the European Community (represented by the Commission of the European Com-munities) is supporting the development of a set of handbooks on current best methods in order to facilitate the implementation of principle 8 of the Code of Practice- “Appropriate statistical proce-dures, implemented from data collection to data validation, must underpin quality statistics”.

40|$|In 1994, Eurostat {{launched}} {{its approach to}} quality measurement based {{on the experience of}} (statistical) organisations around the world and with the explicit support of several national statistical offices of the European Union. Much of the methodological work for measuring and reporting on the quality has been discussed and agreed upon with the Member States of the European Union. The main forum for this has been the Working Group on the Assessment of Quality in Statistics. In addition to general quality related methodological work Eurostat has set up ad-hoc task forces with the Member States and has started laying down quality provisions in legal acts. Special task forces have been created for the measurement of quality in National Accounts, Balance of Payments statistics, Labour Force Survey, Foreign Trade statistics and variance estimations. The Leadership Expert Group on Quality (LEG) 2 was set-up in 1999 and the main purpose was to attain improved quality in the <b>European</b> <b>Statistical</b> System (ESS). The LEG provides a number of recommendations for the ESS regarding its quality work, and the final work of the LEG was approved by the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Programme</b> Committee (SPC) meeting in September this year.

40|$|European Union (EU) wide {{statistics}} {{are derived from}} national statistics produced in each Member State (MS) by a National Statistical Institute (NSI) {{and a set of}} other statistical departments, in a combination that is specific of every MS. The global set of these statistical departments builds the so-called <b>European</b> <b>Statistical</b> System (ESS). The NSIs have a co-ordinating role in each Member State- however their power varies from country to country- and the co-ordinating body of the ESS is the <b>Statistical</b> <b>Programme</b> Committee (SPC). Eurostat- as a General Directorate of the European Commission- has the exclusive right to make proposals for EU legal texts in the domain of statistics. The SPC is a consultative Committee. The legal texts are discussed and adopted jointly by the European Parliament and the European Council (a series of thematic Committees made of delegates of each MS). When legal texts are adopted, the role of Eurostat is to co-ordinate their implementation along the procedures imbedded in these texts, in general through Management Committees. Quite typically, standards are developed at the EU level, whereas data collection is organised by the Member States. The architecture of this complex "multi-dimensional" system has to be kept in mind to understand the features of the European Statistics. 2. Quality as a tool {{in the construction of the}} ES...|$|R
