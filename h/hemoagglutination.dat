40|$|The study {{deals with}} {{evaluation}} of ligand specificities of hemoagglutinins and hemolysins of hemolymph of three species of gastropods (Planorbius corneus, Lymnaea stagnalis, and Achatina fu[ica) and one species of bivalve molluscs (Anodonta cygnea). The hemoagglutinin titer was estimated from <b>hemoagglutination</b> reaction, the hemolysin titer, spectrophotometrically, from release of hemoglobin from sheep erythrocytes. The ligand specificity of hemoagglutinins and hemolysins was evaluated by an inhibitory {{modification of the}} <b>hemoagglutination</b> reaction. It {{has been shown that}} hemoagglutinins and hemolysins of pulmonary gastropod molluscs have different spectra of ligand specificity to the substances of the carbohydrate nature. Hemoagglutinins and hemolysins of the bivalve mollusc Anodonta cygnea have the same spectrum of ligand specificity. Among the ligands of these lectins, terminal N-acetylated sugars and monosaccharides predominate.

40|$|As {{to trial}} toward the {{elimination}} of Japanese encephalitis virus in natural surroundings, pigs received inoculation of inactivated Japanese encephalitis vaccine supplemented with complete Freund's adjuvant twice at one-week interval. Effect of adjuvant supplement on the magnitude of antibody and also prevention of viremia caused by natural infection by antibody induced with vaccine were investigated. The {{results of this study}} are summarized as follows. 1. In the group of pigs inoculated with vaccine containing adjuvant, titer of <b>hemoagglutination</b> inhibiting and neutralizing antibodies was higher than those inoculated with vaccine alone and their high titer persisted. 2. With respect to natural infection of pigs, on August 22 when the pigs were thought to have been infected, there was observed a rise in antibody titers. And on antibody formed in those pigs inoculated with vaccine with or without adjuvant proved to be all 2 -ME resistant type, whereas the antibodies produced in control group were 2 -ME sensitive antibody. 3.

40|$|Transformation of Japanese {{encephalitis}} antibody from IgM to IgG in the sera of {{the experimental}} infected chicks with Japanese encephalitis virus and transmission of IgM or IgG from hen to chicks were examined by the gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200 column. The following results were obtained. 1. Titer of <b>hemoagglutination</b> inhibiting antibody rose on seven days after inoculation of mouse brain homogenate infected with Japanese encephalitis, and that increased rapidly after the second inoculation of Japanese encephalitis. The maximum peak of antibody titer attained on 35 days after the first inoculation, on 7 days after the second inoculation and it maintained {{for a period of}} 2 months then decreased. Viremia was detected till 6 hours after the first inoculation. 2. IgM antibody by gel filtration appeared on 7 days after the first inoculation, kept on rising, reached the peak on 35 days after the first inoculation, then decreased, and disappeared on 120 days. IgG antibody appeared about 2 weeks after the IgM antibody appearance, and the titer of IgG antibody became higher than that of IgM antibody on 35 days after the first inoculation, then decreased gradually, and showed 1 : 16 of titer of peak on 150 days by gel filtration. 3.

40|$|Variation in the {{incidence}} and causal factors of Japanese Encephalitis in Okayama Prefecture from 1950 to 1989 were surveyed, with results revealing, first, that incidence rates of Japanese Encephalitis peaked first in 1950 and then again in 1956 and 1964, with cases of Japanese Encephalitis rarely found since 1971. Second, positivity rates of <b>hemoagglutination</b> inhibition antibody tests decreased after July 1967. Third, the numbers of swine per pigsty has increased annually, indicating that large-scale pigsties have been constructed. Fourth, the prevalence of culex tritaeniorhynchus decreased beginning in 1965 though it has gradually recovered since 1974. Fifth, the vaccination rate of the inhibitants of the area increased beginning in 1957, peaked in 1967, and has since gradually declined.

40|$|From October 2010 to April 2011, in the Italian Veneto Region, 1403 hospitalized {{patients}} were tested for influenza virus infection by specific real time RT-PCR. Overall, 327 samples were positive for either influenza A (75 %) or B (25 %) viruses. Among these positive patients two resulted co-infected by A/H 1 N 1 v and B viruses. Even though co-infection with both influenza A and B viruses {{appears to be}} a rare event, it occurs naturally and {{may play a role in}} epidemiology and pathogenicity. In the present study the two co-infected patients were a transplant recipient immunocompromised adult and a child displaying a severe respiratory illness.

40|$|This work {{deals with}} {{analysis}} of {{changes of the}} levels of hemoagglutinins (HA) and hemolysins (HL) in hemolymph of three gastropod species, Planorbius corneus, Lymnea stagnalis, and Achatina fulica, in response to immunization with sheep erythrocytes (ShE). The levels of HA and HL were determined before immunization and 3, 5, 10, and 15 days after the antigen administration. The HA titer was estimated from <b>hemoagglutination</b> reaction, the HL titer was measured spectrophotometrically from release of hemoglobin from ShE. It {{has been found that}} after immunization the titer of HA falls by 72 - 88 % for the first 3 - 5 days, but returns to the initial values or even exceeds them statistically significantly by the 10 - 15 th days. The time of the decrease of the HA titers correlates inversely with the body mass of the animals, while the amplitude of this decrease is directly proportional to the body mass. The HL titer either changes parallel to the HA titer (in L. stagnalis) or increases statistically significantly by 60 - 65 % during the entire period of observation (in two other species studied). It is suggested that in P. coneus and A. fulica, HA and HL are different compounds...|$|E

The objective was to detect ABO System epitopes in A. lumbricoides of groups O, A, B and AB patients. 28 adult parasites were obtained from children {{to be used as}} assay material. The patients ABO blood groups were determined. Extracts of A. lumbricoides [AE] were prepared by surgical remotion of the cuticle and refrigerated mechanical rupture. Agglutination Inhibition (AI) and <b>Hemoagglutination</b> Kinetics (HK) tests were used with the [AE]. Of the 28 [AE], eight belonged to O group patients, 15 to A group, three to B group and the remaining two to AB children.

40|$|To know a {{difference}} in the immune responses between the lung and the kindly allo-transplantation, the humoral and cell bound antibody levels were compared by means of cytotoxic assay (CA) and Immune <b>hemoagglutination</b> (IA) test in dogs. 1) The humoral antibody levels were increased five to 10 days prior to appearance of rejection following lung transplantation in spite of maintaining relatively low levels in the course although it was different from kidney one. 2) On the other hand, the cell bound antibody levels were not increased in accordance with the rejection response at lung transplantation. Meanwhile, renal transplantation made the cell antibody levels higher with time in the humoral antibody levels, although cell-bound antibody levels were increased on day five to seven with a seven day maximum, thereafter gradually decreased to some extent. It is of considerable interest that a high humornal antibody levels had a close relation to death. 3) The administration of the antilymphocyte serum (ALS) was effective in suppressing the immune response showing the low humoral antibody levels and improved survival period. 4) Skin transplantation prior to lung or kidney transplantation kept high antibody titers on and after day four lung transplantation and on day seven to 10 at kidney. Conclusion was drawn from this study that skin and lung or kidney have the common cross reacting antigenicity to organ transplantation, in particular, the lung has a strong cross reacting antigenicity to the skin rather than the kidney...|$|E
40|$|The pig {{industry}} in Colombia has grown 30 % {{in the last}} decade achieving high levels of technology and efficiency; in spite of that, respiratory diseases remain a constraint. Since 1970, serological evidence and histological findings suggested the role of swine influenza virus (SIV) as part of the porcine respiratory disease complex; nevertheless, elusive and molecular typing isolates are missing. This study was aimed at isolating SIV from intensive pig farms and to achieve molecular characterization to determine strains circulating in the field. In order to accomplish this goal, 242 samples were taken from nasal swabs, 25 from bronchial washes and 8 from lung tissue. Samples were collected during a period of three years, between 2008 and 2010 and were originated from 78 farms of the three main pig production regions of the country. The samples were transported in BHI broth with 2 % antibiotic and antimycotic solution and stored at – 70 ?C until processed. The swabs were inoculated in 9 - 11 days old embryo chicken eggs and in MDCK (Madin Darby Canine Kidney) cell cultures with the addition of trypsin. The isolates were identified by the HA (<b>hemoagglutination)</b> test and by RT-PCR targeting the HA (hemagglutinin), NA (Neuraminidase) and M (Matrix) genes. Full length sequence of the HA and NA glycoproteins from four selected virus isolates was conducted (Macrogen®. USA). As a result, fifteen SIV isolates from nine farms distributed in the three regions were obtained. Twelve of the isolates are related to the swine origin H 1 N 1 virus that caused the 2009 influenza pandemic. The remaining three viruses were related to classical swine influenza viruses...|$|E
40|$|Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV), {{belonging}} to Coronaviridae family, affects the respiratory tract of poultry causing a mild respiratory syndrome, often complicated by many secondary bacterial diseases leading to mortality, great performance decrease and relevant economic losses. IBV {{is characterized by}} a high antigenic and genetic variation and recombination rate, that cause the emrgence of a lot of different strains worldwide, some of those are very persistent in some geographic area while others can appear and disappear quickly. Commonly employed control strategies involve biosecurity and vaccination. Unfortunately, the cross- protection among different IBV strains is often poor, and vaccines are not available for all IBV variants. However, the use of a combination of vaccines {{belonging to}} different IBV genotypes can broaden the protection spectrum to many different variants. Currently, in Italy the circulating genotypes are QX, 793 B, Mass and Q 1, but strains originating from the recombination between QX and 793 B are sporadically detected. In the present study,a monitoring program was carried out in broiler farms using the following vaccination strategy: two spray vaccinations against IBV at hatchery with vaccines belonging to Massachussets and QX genotypes. Tracheal and cloacal swabs and blood samples were collected every 10 days. The swabs were processed in pool and tested using 2 real time RT-PCR specific for the two vaccines and a generic RT-PCR for IBV followed by sequencing. Titration of antibodies against Mass, QX, Q 1 and 793 B strains was perfomed in each sample using <b>hemoagglutination</b> inibition test. The real time RT-PCR for IBV QX vaccine was positive in tracheal swabs at days 12, 22 and 42 and only in cloacal ones at day 12. RT-PCR and sequencing were positive for IBV QX field strain in tracheal swabs at days 32 and 42 and in cloacal ones at days 32, 42 and 52, while tracheal swabs were positive for a QX- 793 B recombinant strain at day 52. No clinical signs were observed during the whole production cycle confirming the efficacy of QX vaccine in controlling the disease caused by homologous variant. Furthermore the detection of a recombinant strain in healthy animal supports the hypothesis that the combination of vaccines applied in this farm could also protect against an enlarged spectrum of variants as already proved for the association between vaccines belonging to Mass and 793 B genotype. Experimental challenges will be necessary to confirm field findings...|$|E

Physico-chemical nature of fowl's antibody of JE produced by natural infection and their maternal antibody in the sera of chicks were examined. The results are briefly summarized as follows. 1) As to the herons captured in Tsudaka Town, two out of six adult night herons and three out of the four chicks showed positive HI reaction. On the other hand, HI reaction in the sera of two adult white herons and three chicks were negative. 2) As to the herons captured in Okayama City, twenty out of thirtytwo adult night herons and seven out of seventy white herons showed positive HI reaction in 1966 around the time when JE was prevalent in Okayama Prefecture. And six out of eleven night herons and one out of seven white herons showing positive HI reaction, responded positively to 2 -ME sensitivity test. 3) The results indicate that white herons can be also infection source ofJE though less than {{in the case of}} night herons. 4) In the domestic fowls (white leghorn) kept at Takahashi District, eight out of twenty-seven fowls showed positive HI reaction. And six out of seven domestic fowls showing positive HI reaction responded positively to 2 -ME sensitive reaction. 5) Transformation of JE antibody in the serum of hen from IgM to IgG was recognized. 6) Domestic chicken's sera having 1 : 640 of HI titer in the original serum and 1 : 320 of HI titer after 2 -ME treatment were fractionated by gel filtration on Sephadex G- 200 and the antibody activities present in the various fractions were determined. HI antibody activities occurred in both IgM and IgG classes of immunoglobulins. 7) Maternal HI antibodies reacting with JE virus were found in newly hatched domestic chickens from the eggs laid by hens with natural infection ofJE. And half life of HI antibodies in chicks was four days. 8) HI antibodies of JE in the serum of maternal immune-hens and chicken having maternal antibody were located in r-globulin fraction by starch block electrophoresis. 9) The results from 4) to 8) indicate the presence of natural infection ofJE in the domestic fowls.
