5|$|Following the court-martial of {{the five}} ringleaders, there was debate among the public, in the media, and within {{government}} over the sentences; while most agreed that a mutiny had occurred, there were differences in opinion on the leniency or severity of the punishments imposed. Public sympathy was with the sailors, and several politicians pressured {{the government and the}} Admiralty to pardon the men. The Admiralty thought the sentences were fair, but on 10 September announced that they would be halved on consideration of the sailors' youth. Despite this, controversy continued until 21 November: after the Australian government appealed directly to the Admiralty, it was agreed that the sailors would be released on 20 December. However, the government had angered the Naval Board in appealing to the Admiralty without consulting the Board first. The First Naval Member, Rear Admiral Percy Grant and Commander of the Fleet, Commodore John Dumaresq, submitted their resignations in protest, as they felt the show of clemency would lead to a breakdown in discipline, and that if the government continued to communicate with the Admiralty without consulting the Board, it would undermine the Board's authority. The two officers were later convinced to withdraw their resignations after receiving assurances that Board would be consulted before all future government communications to Britain regarding the RAN, and that notices would be posted in all ships explaining that the sentences were correct, but the onset of peace had led to clemency <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case.</b>|$|E

25|$|Unlike {{other cities}} in Malaysia, George Town still retains most of its English street names. Even for roads that have been renamed in Malay, such as Jalan Masjid Negeri, Penangites in general still prefer to use the road's former colonial name, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case</b> is Green Lane. This is partly because the new names are often {{unwieldy}} (e.g. Pitt Street vs Jalan Masjid Kapitan Keling, Northam Road vs Jalan Sultan Ahmad Shah), but also reflects a strong conservatism in the local population, who see Penang's colonial history {{as part of their}} local identity.|$|E
25|$|In October 2006, {{according}} to a new naming scheme, East Wenshui Road station was renamed Dabaishu station. The scheme stressed naming stations after existing toponyms, sights and attractions (if any) rather than simply after neighbouring vertical streets, making it easier for visitors to find these places. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case,</b> the renaming aimed also to eliminate possible confusion between Wenshui East Road and Wenshui Road, a newer station of Line 1.

25|$|The {{existence}} of white Siberian tigers {{has not been}} scientifically documented, despite occasional unsubstantiated reports of sightings of white tigers in the regions where wild Siberian tigers live.

25|$|British {{accounts}} of the battle minimized {{the efforts of the}} Dutch-Belgian cavalry. One historian noted that the overall Allied cavalry commander Henry Paget, Earl of Uxbridge placed himself at the front of a Dutch cavalry unit and ordered a charge, but none of the horsemen followed him. Incidents like this one caused many British officers to brand all Dutch soldiers as cowards. The author pointed out that chain-of-command and language problems may have been the real culprits <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case.</b> Only that morning the Prince William of Orange placed the Dutch-Belgian cavalry under Uxbridge's command. In fact, Dutch-Belgian cavalry losses were serious, with two regiments each losing more than 50 killed.|$|E
25|$|As a Prime Minister, Gyurcsány {{was said}} to be an {{advocate}} of the South Stream pipeline project, which is aimed to supply Russian gas directly to EU, bypassing transit countries such as Ukraine. He signed the contract in Moscow just week before a referendum at Hungary, which showed around 80% of the votes were against the government reforms. However, the questions of the referendum (two concerning health care and one concerning education) had no relation to the issue of possible pipelines built in the country. Gyurcsány stated that it is an unlucky situation for a country to have only one supplier (Russia) of any resource, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case</b> is natural gas. He said the South Stream pipeline only diversifies routes from the same source country. He also advocated the Nabucco Pipeline which was planned to transfer gas from the Middle-East, as he considered this as a pipeline which diversifies the source of natural gas also.|$|E

In response to the aftermath of Hot Coffee and the resulting policy changes, ESRB President Patricia Vance stated that in her opinion, [...] "there is no other industry self-regulatory system willing or capable of imposing such swift and sweeping sanctions on its own members, which <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case</b> resulted in the removal of a top-selling product from the market and a major loss of sales."

500|$|Author Joley Wood {{compared}} [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] to {{an alternate}} reality game, {{in analyzing the}} effects of watching the television program Lost on contemporary culture and our own perceptions of reality. Dan O'Brien cited the episode {{in a discussion of}} ontology, skepticism, and religious faith, in his book An Introduction to the Theory of Knowledge. O'Brien leaves it up to the reader {{to decide whether or not}} Lisa was justified in her skepticism. In , [...] "Lisa the Skeptic" [...] is cited as a prime example of why Lisa is seen as the epitome of a nerd. The book also cited the episode in noting that Lisa is not infallible, for when the Angel appeared to speak at the end of the episode she became as frightened as everyone else. Lisa's frustration with the marketing gimmick used by the mall developers is seen by Turner's [...] as yet another example of her conflict with corporations throughout the series. Like O'Brien, Turner also analyzed the episode in the context of Lisa's questions about existentialism, self-absorption, and consumption. In , the authors discuss Lisa's level of anger displayed in the episode, noting that <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case</b> her anger gave her the wherewithal both to confront social injustice, and keep her mind clear for critical thinking. Mark Demming of Allmovie noted that Lisa symbolically stood for the side of reason, while her mother Marge symbolized belief and spirituality in the episode.|$|E

The Thanhouser producers have the excuse, however, <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>particular</b> <b>case</b> that the former telling of the story was a sad failure, while this one has pleasing qualities. Two fathers are determined that their children shall wed each other, but the young folks object to such cut and dried procedure, whereat the fathers pretend to quarrel and forbid the children to love, and the perverse youngsters at once elope, assisted secretly by the parents. The trick of having the boy join the girl in her apparent banishment by hiding in her trunk is the one discordant note in an otherwise plausible and human comedy." [...] The Moving Picture World was more brief, acknowledging the plausibility of the scenario and that the acting was convincing. The Moving Picture News review was also brief, stating, [...] "The film calls for shrieks of laughter; it deserved it, for it is built upon human nature. A story anyone can see and enjoy."
