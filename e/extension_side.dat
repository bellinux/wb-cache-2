40|$|I. Changes in the Various Elements of the Skin (<b>Extension</b> <b>Side</b> of the Male Forearm) Caused by Aging: Although {{researches}} {{have been}} conducted by Newmann, Unna, Dohi Gans, Ejiri {{and others on the}} subject of the histological changes which are to be caused in the skin in normal persons by aging, the. mechanism of atrophy of the skin occurring in old ages has not been fully clarified yet. Obtaining specimen samples of the skin from the middle part on the <b>extension</b> <b>side</b> of the forearms of forty human males, with the ages ranging from five to eighty, the author performed exhaustive investigations on this subject. The following are the summary of the results: (1) No marked changes due to the differences in age were observed in the stratum corneum, the stratum granulosum, the stratum mucosum and the stratum germinativum of the epiderms; and infiltration of the cells and (Dilatation) of the capillaries in the corium were also free from changes resulting from aging. Vacuolar degeneration of the cells forming the stratum granulosum was sometimes noted but no association of this phenomenon with aging has been observed. (2) Dilatation of hair follicles and increased pigmentation in the stratum germinativum did not take place until the latter part of the fifties. (3) Vacuolar degeneration of the cells in the stratum rnucosum and the stratum germinativum was observed more or less in the similar degree. While the twenties and thirties represented the lowest degree in the occurrence of vacuolar degeneration, there were no great differences in the degrees manifested by other generations. This will indicate that severity in vacuolar degeneration has nothing to do with aging. II. Changes in the Connective Tissue of the Corium (<b>Extension</b> <b>Side</b> of the Male Forearm) Caused by Aging. Using the specimen samples which had been used in the investigations mentioned above, investigations were performed on the changes in the running directions, density diameter, deformed state and branchy state of the elastic fibers of the connective tissue of the corium resulting from aging as well as on what differences due to aging the elastic fibers and collagenic fibers would manifest in their behavior toward coloring, In an effort to investigate into themechanisim of retrograde degeneration of the skin, poisons (0. 1 cc of 0. 1...|$|E
40|$|Discrete Element Modeling (DEM) of cyclic {{behavior}} of granular material has been attempted to understand liquefaction {{behavior of}} sands. A series of cyclic biaxial tests in both undrained and drained conditions with constant {{stress and strain}} amplitudes were performed on assemblage of loose and dense systems. Tests are conducted on monodisperse (uniform) and polydisperse (well graded) samples. From this study, {{it has been shown}} that DEM can simulate the cyclic behavior of sands very satisfactorily. Characteristic features, i. e., occurrence of large plastic strains and changing over from contractile to dilative behavior beyond the phase transformation angle, anisotropy of reduced strength on the <b>extension</b> <b>side</b> etc are very well reflected in numerical simulations. Liquefaction of loose assemblage seems to be mainly due to continued and cumulative loss of co-ordination number under each cycle as there is a reversal of loading direction and hence a continuous reorientation of fabric. There is no cumulative loss of co-ordination number in dense states because the stress ratios are mostly higher than the phase transformation level where the fabric has reached a limiting orientation. Micro mechanical explanations to the macroscopic behavior of the disc assemblage under cyclic loading are presented in terms of the force and fabric anisotropy coefficients...|$|E
40|$|Scoliosis is {{a lateral}} {{curvature}} of the spine {{and it is a}} common cause of back pain especially myofacial pain. Cognitive functional therapy is a novel challenges pain-related behaviors in a cognitively integrated, functionally manner. To study the effect of cognitive functional therapy in treatment of back pain due to postural scoliosis. Thirty Egyptian female patients were assigned randomly in to two equal groups. Patients in the control group received traditional therapeutic exercises (myofacial release, stretching and strengthening exercises of the back muscles), while patients in the experimental group received the same program of control group in addition to cognitive functional therapy. Each group received the program three sessions/week for six weeks. The severity of pain, functional disability, cobb's angle, and lumbar range of motion (flexion, <b>extension,</b> <b>side</b> bending to convex side of scoliosis) were measured before and after 6 weeks of treatment. The statistical analysis revealed that there were there were significant reductions in pain level and functional disability and significant increase in ROM of trunk flexion and trunk extension and side bending between both groups (p < 0. 05) in favor to study group. Conclusion: Supplementation of cognitive functional therapy in therapeutic exercise with myofacial release provided additional benefits with respect to pain, function disability, and lumbar range of motion (flexion, extension, and side bending) in patients with back pain due to postural scoliosis after six weeks of treatment...|$|E

40|$|Evidence {{supporting}} {{the use of}} one optimal treatment approach for low back pain is lacking in the research. Two models exist {{to aid in the}} formation of a diagnosis, the pathology-based model and the classification system. The pathology-based models use perceived pathology to arrive at a diagnosis, whereas, a classification system uses categories, criteria, and objective findings in order to place patients into a select group. The purpose of this research was to define a new examination and treatment approach called Biomechanical Correction Technique™ (BCT™) and report the treatment outcomes for a sample of low back pain patients with a flexion mechanism of injury. The subject sample contained 30 subjects that met the inclusion criteria for the study. The data collected from patient records included; subject characteristics, pain reports, number of treatment visits, and range of motion measurements of trunk flexion, <b>extension,</b> <b>side</b> bending, and straight leg raise. The average number of treatments using BCT™ (approximately 9) and patients reported an average decrease in pain of 4 / 10 Trunk flexion, extension, and right and left side bending increased by an average of approximately 23, 19, 12, and 15 degrees, respectively. Straight leg raise measurements increased an average of approximately 15 degrees for both the right and left hips. Analysis of the collected data suggested that BCT™ can result in increases in trunk and hip range of motion measures and decreases in patient reported pain complaints. Results from the data also suggested that age and sex do not affect a positive outcome from treatment. This retrospective study suggests that BCT™ can be an effective treatment for non-scoliosis low back pain caused from a flexion mechanism of injury...|$|E
40|$|The biomechanical {{influence}} of thoraco-lumbo-sacral bracing, a commonly employed treatment in scoliosis, {{is still not}} fully understood. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the immediate corrections generated by different virtual braces using a patient-specific finite element model (FEM) and to analyze the most influential design factors. The 3 D geometry of three patients presenting different types of curves was acquired with a multi-view X-ray technique and surface topography. A personalized FEM of the patients’ trunk and a parametric model of a virtual custom-fit brace were then created. The installation of the braces on the patients was simulated. The {{influence of}} 15 design factors on the 3 D correction generated by the brace was evaluated following a design of experiments simulation protocol allowing computing the main and two-way interaction effects of the design factors. A total of 12, 288 different braces were tested. Results showed a great variability of the braces effectiveness. Of the 15 design factors investigated, according to the 2 modalities chosen for each one, the 5 most influential design factors were the position of the brace opening (posterior vs. anterior), the strap tension, the trochanter <b>extension</b> <b>side,</b> the lordosis design and the rigid shell shape. The position of the brace opening modified the correction mechanism. The trochanter extension position influenced the efficiency of the thoracic and lumbar pads by modifying their lever arm. Increasing the strap tension improved corrections of coronal curves. The lordosis design had an influence in the sagittal plane but not in the coronal plane. This study could help to better understand the brace biomechanics and to rationalize and optimize their design...|$|E
40|$|Study Design: A {{before and}} after design in the {{collection}} of data and using analyses of variance to examine the changes in each test score. Objectives: The objectives and hypotheses of this study are: (1) Do specific core exercises, incorporating the lower limbs improve lower limb stability and trunk core muscle strength?; (2) Can the Star Excursion Balance Test be used as a measure of ankle and lower limb stability without a history of ankle instability?; (3) Can static core tests be used as a measure of core stability?; and (4) Is the Cumberland Ankle Instability Tool (CAIT) questionnaire sufficiently sensitive to show any changes to ankle instability following the outcomes of this study? Background: An earlier study undertaken by Sellentin and Sanchez (2011) r identified specific injuries sustained by Australian garrison soldiers of the 16 Air Defence Regiment. These injuries involved the neck, low back, knee and ankle. This current study was designed to address these injuries by providing exercises to specifically strengthen the core and lower limb muscles and to improve proprioception and muscle movement patterns, with the aim of reducing the number of injuries in Australian soldiers. Methods and Measures: Eight young adult males volunteered for this study (mean age of 22 years). Female Australian soldiers did not participate in this study, as there were none available at the time and there were very few women in the Regiment. The eight male subjects undertook a twelve week supervised exercise programme loosely based on the validated FIFA 11 + programme. Subjects performed specific exercises over twelve weeks which were gradually increased in intensity, difficulty and resistance week by week. Each subject also completed a CAIT questionnaire {{before and after}} the 12 week exercise program. In order to measure any effect from our exercise programme. Each subject was asked to perform a series of sustained flexion, <b>extension,</b> <b>side</b> holds and prone hold tests and the Star Excursion Balance Test (SEBT), which were recorded before and after the exercise programme as assessment tools. The SEBT was also used to assess if there were any sensorimotor deficits related to chronic ankle instability in any of the subjects. We chose to use the SEBT as it has strong intratester and intertester reliability, is sensitive in the detection of functional deficits associated with chronic ankle instability, and with the possibility that this instability might be related to performance deficits in the entire affected extremity (Hertel et al 2006). This is particularly relevant when one of the purposes of our study was to examine if our exercise programme could reduce the risk to the knee and ankle by improving lower limb stability. Results: Even though the sample size was small, there were significant effects in the before and after tests following the 12 week exercise programme: The Sustained Flexion test showed significant improvement. The Prone Hold showed an increase but not a significant change. The Left and Right Side Bridge showed a levelling out. The SEBT showed significant improvement in all of the Posterior reach directions, improvements in the Lateral and Medial reach (left and right limb stance), and improvement in the Anterior reach direction (right limb stance). The Anterior reach direction showed no improvement. Averaging over all the scores of all the tests of the SEBT showed a significant improvement. If the SEBT composite score of Anterior, Posteromedial and Posterolateral reach is taken as a predictor of lower extremity injury (Plisky et al. 2006), the results show a very strong improvement in post exercise scores. There was a shift in each subject’s scores in our current study from below the critical 94...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D. (Education) [...] North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2009. Background: Football (Soccer) {{is arguably}} the most popular sport in the {{international}} sporting arena. A survey conducted by FIFA (Fédération International de Football Association) (FCPA, 2000) indicated that there are 240 million people who regularly play soccer around the world. Internationally, there are 300 000 clubs with approximately 1. 5 million teams. In South Africa, there were 1. 8 million registered soccer players in 2002 / 2003 (Alegi, 2004). Although youth players are predominantly amateurs and have no financial value for their clubs or schools, their continued health and safety are still of vital importance. There are some clubs which contract development players at 19 years of age in preparation for playing in their senior sides and these young players should be well looked after, to ensure a long career playing soccer. Being able to predict injuries and prevent them would be of great value to the soccer playing community. Aims: The main aim of this research was to create a statistical predictive equation combining biomechanics, balance and proprioception, plyometric strength ratios of ND/Bil (Non dominant leg plyometrics/ Bilateral plyometrics), D/Bil (Dominant leg plyometrics/ Bilateral plyometrics) and ND+D/Bil (Non dominant leg + dominant leg plyometrics/ Bilateral plyometrics) and previous injuries to determine a youth soccer player's risk of the occurrence of lower extremity injuries. In the process of reaching this aim it was necessary to record an epidemiological profile of youth soccer injuries over a two season period. It was also necessary to record a physical profile of, and draw comparisons between, school and club youth soccer players. Following the creation of the prediction model a preventative training programme was created for youth soccer players, addressing physical shortcomings identified with the model. Design: A prospective cohort study Subjects: Schoolboy players from two schools in the North West Province, as well as club players from three age groups were used for this study. Players from the U/ 16 and U/ 18 teams in the two schools were tested prior to the 2007 season. Players from the U/ 17, U/ 18 and U/ 19 club development teams were tested prior to the 2008 season. The combined total number of players in the teams amounted to 110 players. Method: The test battery consisted of a biomechanical evaluation, proprioceptive and plyometric testing and an injury history questionnaire. The Biomechanical evaluation was done according to the protocol compiled by Hattingh (2003). This evaluation was divided into five regions with a dysfunction score being given for each region. A single limb stance test was used to test proprioception. A Sergeant jump test was utilised using the wall mark method to test plyometric jumping height. A previous injury questionnaire was also completed on all players prior to testing. Test subjects from the schools were tested with the test battery prior to commencement of the 2007 season. The testing on the club teams was undertaken prior to the 2008 season. Injuries were recorded on the prescribed injury recording form by qualified Physiotherapists at weekly sports injury clinics at each of the involved schools and clubs. The coaching staff monitored exposure to training activities and match play on the prescribed recording forms. These training and match exposure hours were used, along with the recorded injuries for creating an epidemiological profile. Injuries were expressed as the amount of injuries per 1000 play hours. Logistical regression was done by using the test battery variables as independent variables and the variable injured/not injured as dependent variable (Statsoft, 2003). This analysis created prediction functions, determining which variables predict group membership of injured and non injured players. Results: There were 110 youth players involved in the research study from seven teams and four different age groups. There were two groups of U/ 16 players, an U/ 17 group, three U/ 18 groups and an U/ 19 group. The players were involved in a total of 7974 hours of exposure to training and match play during the seasons they were monitored. The average age of the players was 16. 6 years. The majority of players were right limb dominant (83. 6 %) and 65. 7 % of players failed a single limb stance test. The mean jump height for both legs combined was 33. 77 cm, with mean heights of 22. 60 cm for dominant leg jump and 22. 66 cm for the non dominant leg. In the biomechanical evaluation of the lower leg and foot area, the average youth player presented with adaptation of toes, normal or flat medial foot arches, a normal or pronated rear foot in standing and lying and a normal or hypomobile mid-foot joint. Between 42. 7 % and 51. 8 % of players also presenting with decreased Achilles tendon suppleness and callusing of the transverse foot arch. The youth profile for the knee area indicated that the players presented with excessive tightness of the quadriceps muscles, normal patella tilt and squint, normal knee height, a normal Q-angle, a normal VMO: VL ratio and no previous injuries. This profile indicated very little dysfunction amongst youth players for the knee area. For the hip area, the youth profile was described as follows: There was shortening of hip external rotators, decreased Gluteal muscles length, normal hip internal rotation and no previous history of injury. Between 38. 2 % and 62. 7 % of players also exhibit shortened muscle length of the adductor and Iliopsoas muscles and decreased length of the ITB (Iliotibial Band). In the Lumbo-pelvic area there was an excessive anterior tilt of the pelvis with normal lumbar <b>extension,</b> <b>side</b> flexion, rotation and lumbar saggital view without presence of scoliosis. Between 58. 18 % and 65. 45 % of players presented with an abnormal coronal view and decreased lumbar flexion. Between 41. 81 % and 44. 54 % of players also presented with leg length, ASIS, PSIS, Cleft, Rami and sacral rhythm asymmetry. The similarity of the results for these tests in all players contributed to a new variable called 'SIJ dysfunction'. This was compiled from the average of the scores for Leg length, ASIS, PSIS, Cleft, Rami and Sacral rhythm, which was also considered for inclusion in the prediction model. The neurodynamic results of youth players indicated that approximately between 44. 54 % and 50. 91 % of players presented with decreased Straight leg raise and prone knee bend tests. The total combined dysfunction scores for the left and right sides were 17. 091 and 17. 909 respectively, indicating that there were higher levels of dysfunction on the right side than the left. This increased unilateral dysfunction could probably be attributed to limb dominance and increased use of the one leg for kicking and passing during the game. In the epidemiological study on youth players, there were a total of 49 training injuries and 52 match injuries. The total injury rate for youth players was 12. 27 injuries/ 1000 hours, with a total match injury rate of 37. 12 injuries/ 1000 match hours. The combined training injury rate was 7. 17 injuries/ 1000 training hours. 87. 13 % of injuries were of the lower limb area and the individual areas with the highest percentage of injuries were the Ankle (25. 74 %), Knee (19. 80 %), Thigh (15. 84 %) and Lower leg (14. 85 %). The totals for youth players indicated that sprains (30. 69 % of total), strains (27. 72 % of total) and contusions (27. 72 % of total) were the most common causative mechanism of injuries. The severity of injuries show 'zero day' (no time off play) injuries to be the most common type (35. 64 %), followed by 'slight' (1 to 3 days off play) (33. 66 %) and 'minor' (4 to 7 days off play) (14. 85 %). School players had higher injury rates than club players but the severity of injuries to club players was higher, with longer absences from play. Non-contact injuries accounted for 52. 47 % of the total with 46. 53 % being contact injuries. School players had lower levels of non-contact injuries than club players, which correlated well with lower dysfunction scores recorded for school players during the biomechanical evaluations. This demonstrated that there was a definite relationship between levels of biomechanical dysfunction and the percentage of non-contact injuries in youth players, which formed the premise of the creation of a prediction model for non-contact youth soccer injuries. The next step {{in the creation of a}} prediction model was to identify the variables that discriminated maximally between injured and non-injured players. This was done using stepwise logistic regression analysis. After the analysis, ten variables with the largest odds ratios were selected for inclusion in the prediction model to predict non-contact injuries in youth soccer players. The prediction model created from the stepwise analysis presented as follows: P (injury) = exp(- 8. 2483 - 1. 2993 a + 1. 8418 b + 0. 2485 c + 4. 2850 d + 1. 3845 e + 1. 3004 f- 1. 1566 g + 1. 8273 h- 0. 9460 i- 0. 5193 j) l + exp(- 8. 2483 - 1. 2993 a + 1. 8418 b+ 0. 2485 c + 4. 2850 d + 1. 3845 e + 1. 3004 f- 1. 1566 g + 1. 8273 h- 0. 94601 - 0. 5193 J) a = Toe dysfunction b = Previous ankle injury c = Ankle dysfunction d = SIJ dysfunction e = Lumbar Extension f = Straight Leg Raise g = Psoas length h = Patella squint i = Gluteal muscle length j = Lumbar dysfunction P = probability of non contact injury exp(x) = e x, with e the constant 2. 7183 In the ankle area, the toe positional test, previous ankle injury history and combined ankle dysfunction score were included in the prediction model. In the knee area, the patella squint test was included in the model. In the hip area, the Psoas component of the Thomas test was included, along with the Gluteal muscle length test. In the Lumbo-pelvic area, the SIJ dysfunction (average of Leg length, ASIS, PSIS, Rami, Cleft and Sacral rhythm tests), lumbar extension test and lumbar dysfunction scores were included in the prediction model. In the neurodynamic area, the Straight leg raise test was included in the prediction model. The prediction model therefore contained tests from all five the bio mechanical areas of the body. Overall, this model correctly predicted 86. 91 % of players as either injured or not-injured. The I value (effect size index for improvement over chance) of the prediction model (1 = 0. 67), along with the sensitivity (65. 52 %), specificity (94. 87 %), overall correct percentage of prediction (86. 91 %) and Hosmer and Lemeshow interferential goodness-to-fit value (X 2 (8) = 0. 7204), all demonstrated this prediction model to be a valid and accurate prediction tool for non-contact youth soccer injuries A second prediction model, for the prediction of hip and groin injuries amongst youth players, was also created. The prediction model created from the stepwise analysis for groin injuries presents as follows: P (Groin injury) ^ exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d + 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) l + exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d+ 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) d = SIJ dysfunction k = Previous knee injury m = Previous hip injury e = Lumbar extension f = Straight leg raise n = Limb dominance p = ND/Bil plyometric ratio P = probability of groin injury exp(x) = ex, with e the constant 2. 7183 The prediction model for hip and groin injuries included the variables of SIJ dysfunction, previous knee injury, previous hip injury, lumbar extension, straight leg raise, limb dominance and the ratio of non-dominant leg to bilateral legs plyometric height. When all the validifying tests were examined, the I-value (0. 64868), sensitivity (66. 67 %), specificity (98. 01 %), false negatives (1. 98 %), false positives (33. 33 %), Hosmer and Lemeshow goodness-to-fit value (X 2 (8) = 0. 77) and the overall percentage of correct prediction (96. 26 %) all reflected that this model was an accurate prediction tool for hip and groin injuries amongst youth soccer players. Conclusion: This study showed that it was possible to create a prediction model for non-contact youth soccer injuries based on a pre-season biomechanical, plyometric and proprioceptive evaluation along with a previous injury history questionnaire. This model appears as follows: P (injury) = exp(- 8. 2483 - 1. 2993 a + 1. 8418 b + 0. 2485 c + 4. 2850 d + 1. 3845 e + 1. 3004 f - 1. 1566 g + 1. 8273 h - 0. 9460 i - 0. 5193 J) l + exp(- 8. 2483 - 1. 2993 a+ 1. 8418 b + 0. 2485 c + 4. 2850 d + 1. 3845 e + 1. 3004 f- 1. 1566 g+ 1. 8273 h- 0. 94601 - 0. 5193 J) a = Toe dysfunction b=Previous ankle injury c = Ankle dysfunction d= SIJ dysfunction e=Lumbar Extension f = Straight Leg Raise g = Psoas length h = Patella squint i = Gluteal muscle length j = Lumbar dysfunction P = probability of non contact injury exp(x) = ex, with e the constant 2. 7183 It was also possible to create a prediction model for non contact hip and groin injuries, which appears as follows: P (Groin injury) = exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d + 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) l + exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d + 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) d = SIJ dysfunction k = Previous knee injury m = Previous hip injury e = Lumbar extension f = Straight leg raise n = Limb dominance p = ND/Bil plyo metric ratio P = probability of groin injury exp(x) = ex, with e the constant 2. 7183 It was also possible to create a prediction model for non contact hip and groin injuries, which appears as follows: P (Groin injury) = exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d + 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) l + exp(- 116. 2 + 33. 5383 d + 14. 5108 k + 4. 1972 m + 1. 9330 e + 10. 7006 f- 14. 4028 n + 48. 8751 p) d = SIJ dysfunction k = Previous knee injury m = Previous hip injury e = Lumbar extension f = Straight leg raise n = Limb dominance p = ND/Bil plyo metric ratio P = probability of groin injury exp(x) = ex, with e the constant 2. 7183 Using the hip and groin prediction model, combined with the injury prediction model, injuries in youth soccer players can be predicted. The data for each player should first be substituted into the injury prediction model, to determine the chance of getting injured during the season. The data should then be substituted into the hip and groin injury prediction model, determining the chance of hip and groin injuries during the season. The results from the groin injury prediction model could then be used to exclude groin injuries amongst players. A negative result for the hip and groin injury, which showed a false negative percentage of 1. 98 %, could be used to determine that an injury that was predicted using the overall injury prediction model, would not be a hip and groin injury. A positive result in the groin injury test could, however, not exclude injuries to other body areas that were predicted by the overall injury prediction model, so the groin injury prediction model could only be used to exclude hip and groin injuries.

Inside, the Sports and VR-X also shared white instrument cluster dials, sports fabric seat trim and front seat backrests embroidered with the respective models' name. The automatic VR-X also had a chrome gear gate inherited from the Verada. The subsequent and rare Magna Sports wagon (produced only with the TJ series) was fitted with a full bodykit featuring silver accents, unlike the Sports sedan that featured only had a deck lid spoiler.|$|R

5000|$|Styling {{changes on}} the 1972 Ambassador were limited to a new {{crosshatch}} cast metal grille with bright trim and new integrated fender <b>extension</b> mounted <b>side</b> marker lamps on the front. Brougham station wagons included a roof rack, rear air deflector, as well as 3M [...] "dinoc" [...] woodgrain trim on body sides and tailgate.|$|R
5000|$|Type 63A-I - Type 63A {{fitted with}} a bow <b>extension,</b> bigger <b>side</b> skirts which cover the tracks more, {{attachments}} points for additional armour {{on the front of}} the turret (possibly ERA) and more advanced sighting devices (as evidenced by larger periscopes). It is also known by industrial designator, WZ213-1. It is also known as ZTS63A-1.|$|R
25|$|Similar to pea {{whistles}}, samba whistles {{have a small}} ball or dowel {{to create}} {{the same sort of}} sound, but often also have two <b>extensions</b> either <b>side</b> of the chamber. None, one or both of these can be blocked to create a 'tri-tone' effect. The apito de samba is a traditional Portuguese example of a samba whistle.|$|R
50|$|A final {{attempt at}} a regular service started on 7 June 1873, {{but there was little}} {{patronage}} and it ceased five days later, on 12 July 1873. £500,000 had been expended on the harbour. In October 1874 the rails were lifted and moved to Newton Stewart {{to be used in the}} <b>extension</b> of <b>siding</b> accommodation there.|$|R

40|$|The single-expansion-ramp-nozzle (SERN) {{experiment}} underway at NASA Ames Research Center simulates the National Aerospace Plane propulsive jet-plume flow. Recently, limited {{experimental data}} has become available from an experiment with a generic nozzle/afterbody model in a hypersonic wind tunnel. The present paper presents full three-dimensional solutions obtained with the implicit Navier-Stokes solver, FL 3 D, for the baseline model and {{a version of}} the model with <b>side</b> <b>extensions.</b> Analysis of the computed flow clearly shows the complex 3 -D nature of the flow, critical flow features, and the effect of <b>side</b> <b>extensions</b> on the plume flow development. Flow schematics appropriate for the conditions tested are presented for the baseline model and the model with <b>side</b> <b>extensions.</b> The computed results show excellent agreement with experimental shadowgraph and with surface pressure measurements. The computed and experimental surface oil-flows show the same features but may be improved by appropriate turbulence modeling...|$|R
