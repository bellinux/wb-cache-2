25|$|Although giant <b>hogweed</b> {{is taking}} hold along the Annick (2006), however the {{riparian}} (water side) flora is still indicative of long established and undisturbed habitats. The rare crosswort, (a {{relative of the}} goosegrass or cleavers) is found nearby. The river contains, amongst others, brown trout, sea trout, salmon, eels, minnows, and stickleback. The water quality is much improved since the Stewarton cloth mills closed and the river no longer carries their dyes and other pollutants {{as shown by the}} presence of freshwater limpets and shrimps, together with leeches, caddis fly larvae and water snail species.|$|E
25|$|Many of {{the water}} meadows are rich in pignut (Conopodium majus), a {{relative}} of parsley, which formed a breaktime snack for children in former times. The plant is dug up to harvest a small potato-like structure that, eaten raw, has a slightly nutty taste. It is available commercially for salads, etc. Hemlock water dropwort grows well in the wetter areas and is best left alone as the name hemlock suggests. The large leaves of the butterbur (Petasites hybridus) are found in several areas; its name harkens {{back to the days}} before clingfilm or cheap paper when the leaves were used to wrap butter destined for the market. Water ragwort (or Saracen's ragwort) (a species of Senecio) is an introduced plant that grows along the Garnock in tall stands. Although it is common on the Garnock and at present quite rare elsewhere. Himalayan balsam or policemen's helmets is another introduction, but a common one. Giant <b>hogweed</b> is beginning to make its presence felt. It is another plant that should never be handled, as the sap can cause severe blistering and scarring of the skin.|$|E

500|$|<b>Hogweed</b> borscht {{was mostly}} a poor man's food. The soup's humble {{beginnings}} are still reflected in Polish fixed expressions, where [...] "cheap like borscht" [...] {{is the equivalent}} of [...] "dirt cheap" [...] (also attested as a calque in Yiddish and Canadian English), whereas adding [...] "two mushrooms into borscht" [...] is synonymous with excess. For the professors of the University of Kraków, who led a monastic way of life in the 17th century, <b>hogweed</b> borscht was a fasting dish which they ate regularly (sometimes with deviled eggs) from Lent till Rogation days. It was uncommon on the royal table, although according to the 16th-century Polish botanist Marcin of Urzędów – citing , a court physician to the Jagiellonian kings of Hungary – the Polish-born King Vladislaus II used to have a Polish hogweed-based dish prepared for him at his court in Buda.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} known Polish {{recipes for}} borscht, written by chefs catering to Polish magnates (aristocrats), {{are from the}} late 17th century. , head chef to Prince , included several borscht recipes in his [...] (A Collection of Dishes), the first cookbook published originally in Polish, in 1682. They include such sour soups as lemon borscht and [...] "royal borscht", the latter made from assorted dried, smoked or fresh fish and fermented rye bran. A manuscript recipe collection from the [...] family court, dating back to ca. 1686, contains an instruction for making <b>hogweed</b> borscht mixed with poppy seeds or ground almonds. As this was a Lenten dish, it was garnished, in a [...] fashion typical of Baroque cuisine, with mock eggs made from finely chopped pike that was partly dyed with saffron and formed into oval balls. An alternative recipe for the almond borscht replaced pickled <b>hogweed</b> with vinegar.|$|E
50|$|Unlike other swallowtails which specialise on Rutaceae, {{this species}} mostly feeds on plants of family Umbelliferae, females laying eggs singly. Milk parsley (also known as marsh hog's fennel) is {{normally}} the only food plant {{used by the}} caterpillars of the British subspecies. The food plants of the swallowtail in Europe, Asia, and North America are more varied than in the UK. It uses {{a wide variety of}} umbellifers including wild carrot (Daucus carota), wild angelica (Angelica sylvestris), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), and <b>hogweeds</b> (Heracleum). In the Maltese Islands, the caterpillar feeds on plants such as rue (Ruta chalepensis) in addition to Umbelliferae such as fennel.|$|R
40|$|Since {{first of}} January 2015, the EU-regulation 1143 / 2014 obligates {{all member states}} to conduct {{cost-benefit}} analyses in preparation of control programs for invasive alien species to minimize and mitigate their impacts. In addition, with ratification of the Rio Declaration and the amended Federal Nature Conservation Act, Germany is committed to control any further spread of invasive species. This is the first cost-benefit analysis estimating positive welfare effects and societal importance of H. mantegazzianum invasion control in Germany. The paper analyses possible control options limiting stands of giant <b>hogweeds</b> (H. mantegazzianum) based on survey data of n = 287 German districts. We differentiate between several control options (e. g. root destruction, mechanical cutting or mowing, chemical treatment and grazing) depending on infested area size and protection status. The calculation of benefits is based on stated preference results (choice experiment; n = 282). For the cost side, we calculate two different invasion scenarios (i) no re-infestation after successfully conducted control measures (optimistic) and (ii) re-infestation twice after conducting control measures occurring within ten years (pessimistic). Minimum costs of eradication measures including a time span of ten years and a social discount rate of 1 % result {{in a total of}} 3, 467, 640 € for optimistic scenario and 6, 254, 932 € for pessimistic invasion scenario, where no success of the first eradication attempt is assumed. Benefits of invasion control in Germany result in a total of 238, 063, 641 € per year and overassessment-factor corrected in 59, 515, 910 € per year...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability of}} giant <b>hogweeds</b> to form monodominant {{communities}} and even pure monostands in invaded areas {{has been well}} documented. Understanding of the mechanisms leading to monostand formation can aid in determining the limitations of existing community ecology models and establishing an effective management plan for invasive species elimination. The aim of this observational {{study was to investigate}} traits of Heracleum sosnowskyi plants (demography, canopy structure, morphology and physiology) of the plants in a pure stand in an invaded area useful for understanding potential monostand formation mechanisms. All measurements were performed in one typical Heracleum sosnowskyi monostand located in an abandoned agriculture field located in Syktyvkar city suburb (North-east Russia). This monostand consisted of five main plant growth stages: seed, seedling, juvenile, vegetative adult, and generative adult. Plants of all stages began to grow simultaneously shortly after the snowmelt, {{at the same time as}} spring ephemeral plant species grew. The density of generative plants did not change during the vegetation period, but the density of the other plant stages rapidly decreased after the formation of a tall (up to 2 - 2. 5 m) and dense (Leaf area index up to 6. 5) canopy. The canopy captured approximately 97 % of the light. H. sosnowskyi showed high (several orders of magnitude higher than average taiga zone grasses) photosynthetic water use efficiency (6 - 7 μM CO 2 /μM H 2 O). Formation of H. sosnowskyi monostands occurs primarily in disturbed areas with relatively rich and well-moistened soils. Early commencement of growth, rapid formation of a dense canopy, high efficiency of light and water use during photosynthesis, ability of young plants to survive in low light conditions, rapid recovery of above-ground plant parts after damage, and the high density of the soil seed bank are the most important traits of H. sosnowskyi plants for monostand formation in invaded areas...|$|R
500|$|The {{earliest}} written {{reference to}} the Slavic <b>hogweed</b> soup {{can be found in}} [...] (Domestic Order), a 16th-century Russian compendium of moral rules and homemaking advice. It recommends growing the plant [...] "by the fence, around the whole garden, where the nettle grows", to cook a soup of it in springtime and reminds the reader to, [...] "for the Lord's sake, share it with those in need". Simon Syrenius (...) , a 17th-century Polish botanist, described [...] "our Polish hogweed" [...] as a vegetable that was well known throughout Poland, Rus', Lithuania and Samogitia (that is, most of the northern part of Eastern Europe), typically used for cooking a [...] "tasty and graceful soup" [...] with capon stock, eggs, sour cream and millet. More interested in the plant's medicinal properties than its culinary use, he also recommended pickled <b>hogweed</b> juice as a cure for fever or hangover.|$|E
500|$|Together with {{cognates}} {{in other}} Slavic languages, {{it comes from}} Proto-Slavic *bŭrščǐ 'hogweed' and ultimately from Proto-Indo-European *bhr̥sti- < *bhares-/bhores- 'point, stubble'. Common <b>hogweed</b> (...) was the soup's principal ingredient before it was replaced with other vegetables, notably beetroot. The beetroot borscht was invented {{in what is now}} Ukraine and first popularized in North America by Yiddish-speaking Ashkenazi Jews from Eastern Europe.|$|E
500|$|When {{describing}} {{the uses of}} common <b>hogweed,</b> John Gerard, a 17th-century English botanist, observed that [...] "the people of [...] and Lithuania [...] to make [...] drink with the decoction of this herb and leaven or some other thing made of meal, which is used instead of beer and other ordinary drink." [...] It may suggest that <b>hogweed</b> soup was on some occasions combined with a fermented mixture of water and barley flour, oatmeal or rye flour. Such soured, gelatinous flour-and-water mixture, originally known as kissel (from the Proto-Slavic root *kyslŭ, 'sour') had been already mentioned in The Tale of Bygone Years, a 12th-century chronicle of Kievan Rus', and {{continued to be a}} staple of Ukrainian and Russian cooking until the middle of the 19th century. In Poland, a soup based on diluted kissel became known as either [...] (from Middle High German [...] 'sour') or [...] and later – to distinguish it from the red beetroot borscht – as [...] 'white borscht'.|$|E
500|$|The Slavs {{collected}} <b>hogweed</b> in May {{and used}} its roots for stewing with meat, while the stems, leaves and umbels were chopped, covered {{with water and}} left {{in a warm place}} to ferment.

500|$|A {{number of}} [...] non-native, {{invasive}} {{species have been}} identified as a threat to native biodiversity, including Giant <b>Hogweed,</b> Japanese Knotweed and Rhododendron. In May 2008 it was announced that psyllid lice from Japan, which feed on the Knotweed, may be introduced to the UK to bring the plant under control. This would be the first time that an alien species has been used in Britain in this way. Scientists at the Commonwealth Agricultural Bureaux International do not believe the lice will cause any environmental damage. Over-grazing caused by the large numbers of Red Deer and sheep has also resulted in the impoverishment of moorland and upland habitats and a loss of native woodland.|$|E
500|$|Borscht {{derives from}} an ancient soup {{originally}} cooked from pickled stems, leaves and umbels of common <b>hogweed</b> (Heracleum sphondylium), a herbaceous plant growing in damp meadows, which lent the dish its Slavic name. With time, it {{evolved into a}} diverse array of tart soups, among which the beet-based red borscht {{has become the most}} popular. It is typically made by combining meat or bone stock with sautéed vegetables, which – as well as beetroots – usually include cabbage, carrots, onions, potatoes and tomatoes. Depending on the recipe, borscht may include meat or fish, or be purely vegetarian; it may be served either hot or cold; and it may range from a hearty one-pot meal to a clear broth or a smooth drink. It is often served with smetana or sour cream, hard-boiled eggs or potatoes, but there exists an ample choice of more involved garnishes and side dishes, such as [...] or , that can be served with the soup.|$|E
2500|$|In {{almost all}} {{cultures}} objects are named using {{one or two}} words equivalent to [...] "kind" [...] (genus) and [...] "particular kind" [...] (species). When made up of two words (a binomial) the name usually consists of a noun (like salt, dog or star) and an adjectival second word that helps describe the first, and therefore makes the name, as a whole, more [...] "specific", for example, lap dog, sea salt, or film star. The meaning of the noun used for a common name may have been lost or forgotten (whelk, elm, lion, shark, pig) but when the common name is extended to two or more words much more is conveyed about the organism's use, appearance or other special properties (sting ray, poison apple, giant stinking <b>hogweed,</b> hammerhead shark). These noun-adjective binomials are just like our own names with a family or surname like Simpson and another adjectival Christian or forename name that specifies which Simpson, say Homer Simpson. It seems {{reasonable to assume that}} the form of scientific names we call binomial nomenclature is derived from this simple and practical way of constructing common names - but with the use of Latin as a universal language.|$|E
