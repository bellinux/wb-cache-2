Power based key <b>hopping</b> is founded on the idea of dynamic frequency power-based <b>hopping</b> to change the user key.

5|$|Hip <b>Hop</b> International (HHI) {{was founded}} in 2002 in the United States by Howard and Karen Schwartz. There are two {{categories}} of competitions: World Battles and World Hip <b>Hop</b> Dance Championship. Within the World Battles category, there are four titles including three-on-three breaking champions, one-on-one popping champion, one-on-one locking champion, and one-on-one all styles (freestyle) champion. The World Hip <b>Hop</b> Dance Championship is for hip-hop crews. There are four divisions: junior (ages 7–12), varsity (12–18), adult (18+), and mega crew (all ages). Each crew must have at least five {{but not more than}} nine people (mega crew must have 15–40) and must perform a routine that showcases three styles of hip-hop dance. For the 2009 competition, there were 120 crews representing 30 countries. HHI also created the USA Hip <b>Hop</b> Dance Championship and the television show America's Best Dance Crew.|$|E

5|$|In hip <b>hop</b> culture, a grill (most {{commonly}} referred to as grills), also known as fronts or golds, is a type of jewelry worn over the teeth. Grills are made of metal and are generally removable. They began to be worn by hip-hop artists in New York City in the early 1980s, and upgraded during the '90s in Oakland. They became even more widely popular during the mid-2000s due to the rise of Southern hip <b>hop</b> rap and the more mainstream pop culture status hip <b>hop</b> attained.|$|E
40|$|In the 3 GPP LTE, {{different}} {{radio resource}} management (RRM) techniques {{have been proposed}} {{in order to improve}} the uplink performance. Frequency <b>hopping</b> is one of the techniques {{that can be used to}} improve the uplink performance by providing frequency diversity and interference averaging. The <b>hopping</b> can be between subframes (inter-subframe) or within a subframe (intra-subframe). 3 GPP specifies two types of frequency <b>hopping</b> for the LTE uplink, <b>hopping</b> based on explicit <b>hopping</b> information in the scheduling grant and sub-band based <b>hopping</b> according to cell-specific <b>hopping</b> and mirroring patterns. In this master’s thesis, theoretical discussion on the frequency <b>hopping</b> schemes is carried out followed by dynamic simulations in order to evaluate the performance gain of frequency <b>hopping.</b> Based on the theoretical analysis, the second type of <b>hopping</b> is selected for detailed study. As a baseline for comparison, dynamic frequency domain scheduling with random frequency resource allocation has been used. Single cell and multi-cell scenarios have been simulated with VoIP traffic model using user satisfaction as a performance metric. The simulation results show that frequency <b>hopping</b> improves the uplink performance by providing frequency diversity in the single cell scenario and both frequency diversity and interference averaging in the multi-cell scenario. The gains in using the <b>hopping</b> schemes were reflected as VoIP capacity (the number of satisfied users) improvement. In this study, the performance of the selected <b>hopping</b> schemes under different <b>hopping</b> parameters is also evaluated. ttma 07 @student. bth. se tariku. temesgen. mehari@ericsson. co...|$|R
