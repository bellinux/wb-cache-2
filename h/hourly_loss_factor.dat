40|$|Modified power {{injection}} method (MPIM) Abstract. In this paper, methods of acquiring internal <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> and coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> by experimental measurement are investigated. The internal <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> and coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of two coupled plates {{is measured by}} the modified {{power injection}} method. The SEA model of coupled system is established based on the measured results of internal <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> (ILF) and coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> (CLF). A random vibration analysis is conducted as a validation example. Since the formulation solution and measured result agree preferably, the validity of the measurement method and the effectiveness of analyzing vibration response using SEA are proved...|$|R
40|$|High-frequency vibroacoustic {{modeling}} {{is typically}} performed using energy-based {{techniques such as}} Statistical Energy Analysis (SEA). Energy models require {{an estimate of the}} internal damping <b>loss</b> <b>factor.</b> Unfortunately, the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> is difficult to estimate analytically, and experimental methods such as the power injection method can require extensive measurements over the structure of interest. This paper discusses the implications of estimating damping <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> using the impulse response decay method (IRDM) from a limited set of response measurements. An automated procedure for implementing IRDM is described and then evaluated using data from a finite element model of a stiffened, curved panel. Estimated <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> are compared with <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> computed using a power injection method and a manual curve fit. The paper discusses the sensitivity of the IRDM <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> estimates to damping of connected subsystems and the number and location of points in the measurement ensemble...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of energy among the subsystems of a system {{can be found in}} terms of the modes of the system. If there are enough modes in the frequency band of interest then the system can be described by an SEA model. However, in general this is a "quasi-SEA" model, which involves both direct and indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors,</b> whose values depend on the modal overlap. This paper explores the conditions under which the indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> are zero, so that the system is described by a "proper-SEA" model. It also investigates the dependence of the direct and indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> on the modal properties of the system and on the modal overlap. In summary, the indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> are zero, so that a proper-SEA model can be formed, either if all the system modes are local or in the weak coupling regime as the modal overlap becomes large. It is seen that in the low modal overlap limit the coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> are proportional to the damping <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> and equipartition of energy only occurs if all modes are global. For higher modal overlap the SEA parameters depend on the detailed statistics of the modes and the situation is complicated. However, if all the modes are local the indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> are all zero. In the high modal overlap limit the coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> asymptote to constants, with indirect coupling <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> becoming zero. This behaviour occurs because of mode shape correlation at the boundary between two directly connected subsystems...|$|R

40|$|The {{identification}} of the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of fiber-reinforced composite based on complex modulus method is presented. Firstly, the damping model of fiber-reinforced composite plate is established, and the relation between each <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> and modal damping ratio is deduced based on the complex modulus method. Then, the least square relative error function is formed by using the modal damping ratio obtained in the experimental test, and the appropriate step-size is selected {{in the range of}} 0 ~ 10 % to calculate the <b>loss</b> <b>factor.</b> Next, the identification procedure of <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of such composite material is summarized, and the corresponding identification procedure is realized based on self-designed MATLAB program. Finally, TC 300 carbon/epoxy composite plate is taken as an example to carry out a case study, and its <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> along the longitudinal, transverse, and shear direction are identified by the complex modulus method. By comparing the measured damping results obtained in this paper and the calculated damping results based on the Adams-Bacon model with the same <b>loss</b> <b>factor,</b> it is found that the corresponding maximum deviation between them is less than 15 %, so the correctness of such identification method has been verified indirectly, which can be used to identify <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of fiber-reinforced composite with high precision and efficiency...|$|R

Knowledge of the {{dielectric}} properties of commodities and insect pests {{is important in}} developing thermal treatments for postharvest insect control based on radio frequency (RF) and microwave energy. The dielectric properties of six subtropical and tropical fruits along with four associated insect pests were measured between 1 and 1800 MHz using an open-ended coaxial-line probe technique and at temperatures between 20 °C and 60 °C. The dielectric <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of the fruits and the insects decreased with increasing frequency at constant temperatures. Especially over 10 to 300 MHz, the log of {{the dielectric}} <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> decreased linearly with the log of increasing frequency. The <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of the fruits and the insects increased almost linearly with increasing temperature at 27. 12 MHz radio frequency, but remained in a small range at 915 MHz microwave frequency. Both the dielectric constant and the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> were the highest in avocado fruit.

30|$|It can be {{seen from}} Fig. 5 b that the {{vulcanization}} time has a certain influence on the damping properties of the foamed EPDM rubber. At a temperature of −[*] 25  °C, the maximum <b>loss</b> <b>factor,</b> the effective damping temperature range is −[*] 65  °C~[*] 20  °C, and there is a peak at −[*] 45  °C, a unique liquid-liquid transition peak of EPDM rubber. Under different curing time, their effective damping temperature range is not much different, but the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> is different. The vulcanization times corresponding to the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> from large to small are 30  min, 35  min, 25  min, 20  min, and 15  min, respectively. When the vulcanization time is 15  min, the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> of the foamed EPDM rubber is the lowest. When the vulcanization time is 20  min, the <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> is slightly higher, and the vulcanization time has a higher <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> at 25  min and 35  min. At 30  min, there is a maximum <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> with a value of 1.44. The reason for this phenomenon is similar to 3.2 (A). When the energy passes through the small and dense cells, there is greater energy loss. When the vulcanization time is 15  min, the generated cells are too small, the energy loss is small, and the damping performance is poor. When the vulcanization time is 20  min, the cells are too large and the energy loss is small. However, when the vulcanization time is 30  min, the generated cells are small and dense, and when the energy is passed, a large internal friction is generated by friction with the wall of the hole, waveform conversion, relaxation, etc., and the damping performance is improved.|$|R

Accordingly the use of short fibres results in {{a slight increase in}} <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> for a negligible sacrifice in stiffness by introducing shear strain magnification at the fibre tips. However, selection of a highly dissipative matrix resin along with the careful design of fibre lay-up yielded a stiff light CFRP with substantially increased damping. An experimental apparatus was designed and built, which enabled the <b>loss</b> <b>factors</b> of CFRPs undergoing both applied and induced combined shear and flexural vibrations to be measured. Predictions of combined mode damping behaviour were made according to existing equivalent strain analyses applied firstly to the CFRP as a macroscopically homogeneous material and secondly to the resin as the dissipating phase of the CFRP. The former produced qualitative agreement with experimental results, although physical considerations suggest this agreement to be coincidental only. The latter analysis was concluded to be more representative although the effects of shear deformation ignored in the model were found to be highly significant. Examination of the effects of high dynamic strain amplitudes on the structural damping of longitudinally restrained members necessitated a revision of the fundamental definition of structural <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> and the implications of linear material damping. Consequently the basic assumption that for a linearly damped material structural <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> equals the material <b>loss</b> <b>factor</b> was contradicted.
