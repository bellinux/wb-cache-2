Beatrice, whom Victoria had groomed for the main role at her side, carried out the more important duties, and Helena took on the more minor matters that Beatrice did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do.</b> In later years, Helena was assisted by her unmarried daughter, Helena Victoria, to whom the Queen dictated her journal in {{the last months of}} her life.|$|E
5|$|One of Tolkien's least-known short {{works is}} the children's storybook Mr. Bliss, {{published}} in 1982. It {{tells the story}} of Mr. Bliss and his first ride in his new motor-car. Many adventures follow: encounters with bears, angry neighbours, irate shopkeepers, and assorted collisions. The story was inspired by Tolkien's own vehicular mishaps with his first car, purchased in 1932. The bears were based on toy bears owned by Tolkien's sons. Tolkien was both author and illustrator of the book. He submitted it to his publishers as a balm to readers who were hungry for more from him after the success of The Hobbit. The lavish ink and coloured-pencil illustrations would have made production costs prohibitively expensive. Tolkien agreed to redraw the pictures in a simpler style, but then found he did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. The book was published in 1982 as a facsimile of Tolkien's difficult-to-read illustrated manuscript, with a typeset transcription on each facing page.|$|E
25|$|The version {{shown at}} the 2000 Cannes Film Festival was three hours long. This was a working version that was later cut to 139 minutes with {{director}} Jiang Wen's full participation {{in order to enhance}} the film's commercial prospects and to tighten the storyline, which he did not <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> before the Cannes premier.|$|E

25|$|The {{women at}} the canteen {{went to great lengths}} for the {{servicemen}}. Those who worked at the desk would write cards and letters as well as send telegrams for servicemen who wouldn't otherwise <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so. They even wired for flowers and sent gifts on special occasions. When a service member would call home and confuse the operator because of the hurry that they were in, a woman would help step in and clear up the confusion.|$|E
500|$|Greg Jein {{had already}} {{been working on a}} new model of the USS Excelsior for the [...] "Flashback" [...] episode of Voyager when he saw the test footage for [...] "Trials and Tribble-ations". He promised to make a new model of the Enterprise too, but warned that he didn't know when he would <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it. He {{actually}} started work on it immediately, and together with his colleagues he not only built a [...] long model of the Enterprise, but created a new model of Deep Space Station K7 and the Klingon cruiser as well. The Enterprise model was the first to be built of the original Star Trek starship in more than 30 years. Other props were also recreated, with around 1,400 tribbles created for the various scenes. They were purchased from Lincoln Enterprises, a company set up by Majel Barrett, widow of Star Trek creator Gene Roddenberry. The rest of the era-specific props were newly created, and were made by Steve Horsch.|$|E
500|$|In 2011, a woman {{residing}} in Sheboygan, Wisconsin became unresponsive {{due to an}} asthma attack. Unable to wait for an ambulance, her daughter and a friend performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) on her, which they learned from Grey's Anatomy. Despite this, Resident Karen Zink, M.D., deemed the show's portrayal of interns inaccurate, adding: [...] "None of [...] have bags under their eyes. They all leave the hospital dressed cute, with their hair done and makeup on. That is {{so far away from}} the reality of interns. You are just dragging your butt, trying to stay alive. You don't <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> your hair. You don't have time to put on makeup. Every surgical intern has bags under their eyes." [...] The series placed at No. 66 on Entertainment Weekly [...] "New TV Classics" [...] list, and was declared the third highest rated show for the first ten years of the Internet Movie Database (2002–2012).|$|E

My band has been doing things lately, so I don't really <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> anything. I kinda focus my energy there [...] Of course, you know, possibilities..." ...|$|E

60|$|Guy's {{first visit}} {{was of course}} to Mrs. Henley, and she was, on her side, {{prepared}} by her brother to patronize him as Philip would have done in her place. Her patronage was valuable in her own circle; her connections were good; the Archdeacon's name was greatly respected; she had a handsome and well-regulated establishment, and this, together with talents which, having no family, she had cultivated more than most women <b>have</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> made her a person of considerable distinction at St. Mildred's.

I think the Bible is the only book I really study now, so, you see, I've been thinking of adding to our establishment by getting a new servant;--a sort of nursery governess, you know,--a cheap one, of course.
