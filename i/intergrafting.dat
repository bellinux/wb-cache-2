Estudou-se o efeito de interenxertos, na produção de mudas de pessegueiro. Os tratamentos foram: combinação de dois porta-enxertos ('Okinawa' e 'Capdeboscq'), quatro interenxertos (ameixeira 'Reubennel' e 'Irati', um umezeiro e uma cerejeira 'Capulin') e duas copas ('Coral' e 'Chimarrita'). O delineamento {{experimental}} inicial foi inteiramente ao acaso, com 20 tratamentos, 6 repetições e 8 plantas por parcela. Após a cicatrização e o crescimento dos enxertos, as mudas foram transplantadas para pomar definitivo, sem os tratamentos com os interenxertos de umezeiro e cerejeira que apresentaram baixa sobrevivência com os porta-enxertos de pessegueiro utilizados neste trabalho. O delineamento neste caso foi em blocos ao acaso, com 12 tratamentos, 4 repetições e 11 plantas por parcela. O crescimento das copas foi avaliado pelas seguintes variáveis: diâmetro 5 cm acima do ponto de enxertia, comprimento da ramificação principal e número de ramificações secundárias. Com relação ao crescimento das copas, verificou-se que as mudas interenxertadas com ameixeira apresentam um crescimento reduzido, com possibilidade de utilização em pomares mais adensados. The {{trial was}} carried {{through in the}} fishery of the Embrapa- Technology Transfer in Canoinhas - SC, the period of December of 2003 the July of 2005. The effect of interstock was studied, {{in the production of}} peach tree seedlings. The treatments had been the combination of two rootstock ('Okinawa' and 'Capdeboscq'), four interstock (plum tree 'Reubennel' and 'Irati', Umezeiro and cherry 'Capulin') and two scion ('Coral' and 'Chimarrita'). O initial experimental design used were entirely randomized, with 20 treatments, 6 replications and 8 plants for parcel. After the cicatrisation and growth of the scion, the seedlings had been transplanted for definitive orchard, without the treatments with the interstocks of Umezeiro and Cherry that presented low survival with the peach tree rootstocks used in this work. O delineation in this in case that he were block-type randomized with 12 treatments, 4 repetitions and 11 plants for parcel. The growth of the scion was estimated for the variables: diameter 5 cm above of the point of graft, length of the main ramification and number of secondary ramifications. With relation to the growth of the scion, was verified more that the <b>intergrafting</b> seedlings with plum tree present a reduced growth, with possibility of use in accumulated orchards...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTransgenic tobacco plants expressing {{an altered}} {{form of the}} 2 a {{replicase}} gene from cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) strain Fny exhibited a suppression of viral replication and restricted viral movement when inoculated mechanically or by insect vectors. Resistant plants could be infected, however, through a graft-union with an infected nontransformed plant. The infectious entity moved quickly through <b>intergrafts</b> of resistant tissue, indicating that it could move without replicating in the vascular system. Viral replication continued to be suppressed in systemically infected transgenic portions of grafted plants, {{as demonstrated by the}} synthesis of lower levels of viral RNA than in systemically infected nontransformed portions of the same grafted plants. Cell-to-cell spread within this tissue also occurred much more slowly than in nontransformed tobacco. Young inoculated leaves of transgenic-resistant plants exhibited limited cell-to-cell virus movement, revealed as chlorotic lesions, but no long-distance virus movement occurred. The results ofin situhybridization studies on these lesions indicated that CMV RNA does not traffic from bundle-sheath cells to vascular parenchyma or companion cells in chlorotic lesions on the inoculated leaves of transgenic-resistant tobacco plants. The inhibition of long-distance movement was a consequence of restricted entry of the infectious entity into the vascular system...|$|R
40|$|Graftage is the {{operation}} of inserting a scion into a stock {{so that they will}} form a union and grow together. The essential points are to bring the cambium layers of the stock and scion together, bind them firmly in place, and prevent drying out until they have grown together. The reasons for graftage are: Many fruit and ornamental plants do not come true to variety from seed, and do not otherwise propagate easily. Some varieties on certain rootstocks may be made more productive, more hardy to low temperature, more vigorous, or resistant to disease or insect in-jury, or they may be accommodated to adverse soils. As varieties become unpopular or undesirable, they may be changed to new and better sorts. Further-more, several varieties or species, if desired, may be placed on a single stock. Repairing of injuries and changing of root system may be accomplished by certain kinds of grafting. Theoretically, plants that are closely related botani-cally are capable of being <b>intergrafted.</b> Thus, plants of the same species usually, but not always, can be grafted successfully. There is no general rule, except that based on experience with particular combinations. The time for grafting is generally in the early spring. Scion wood for this operation, however, must be taken while it is dormant, kept cool, and not allowed to dry out. Scions grow out after grafting, producing new tops the same season. Budding, on the other hand, is usually done in the summer, buds being taken from mature wood of the current season's growth and inserted in the stock. They unite and new tops are produced the following season. The methods of grafting and budding are easily learned and as easily practiced, with satisfactory and profitable results...|$|R
40|$|The writers review {{previous}} concepts {{concerning the}} reaction of citrus plants to the tristeza disease. It is recognized that environmental factors such as temperature, humidity and light can influence plant reaction, but these are considered of relatively minor importance. Characteristics of the plant itself govern its reaction to the disease and among those, resistance to infection, ability to permit virus increase and tolerance or non-tolerance of tissues are considered most important. Tests using viruliferous oriental citrus aphids for inoculation of various citrus types budded over sour orange rootstocks (table 1 and 2) showed a correlation between susceptibility to infection and severity of symptoms. The sweet oranges {{proved to be the}} most susceptible to infection and showed severe disease symptoms. The Barão sweet orange appeared to be more susceptible than Valencia. The mandarins tended to show some resistance to infection, but when infected, severe symptoms developed. The tolerant tangelos (7) behaved similarly to sweet oranges : They were very susceptible to infection and showed severe symptoms. The non-tolerant tangelos, susceptible citranges (7) and grapefruits behaved more or less alike, and showed medium susceptibility to infection and moderately severe disease symptoms. Among the grapefruits, Leonardy was. observed to be relatively more susceptible and showed more severe symptoms than Duncan. The pummelos, shaddocks and sour oranges were comparatively very resistant to infection and showed only moderate symptoms when infected. It has been found that the sour oranges can be more easily infected by tissue union than by the aphid vector. Poncirus trifoliata, citrumelos and resistant citranges showed no symptoms and no virus could be recovered from the inoculated plants even after three inoculations. The nature of injury caused by tristeza in the non-tolerant graft and <b>intergraft</b> combinations is discussed. The observation of symptoms shown by plants consisting of a sour orange inter-stem-graft between sweet orange roots and foliage seems to indicate that phloem collapse of the sour <b>intergraft</b> does not entirely prevent food translocation, since under field conditions the sweet stem below the sour <b>intergraft</b> continued, for almost two years, to increase in size at about the same rate as the sweet stem above. The growth of the sour <b>intergraft</b> was observed to be constricted and its lack of developments indicates a possible injurious effect of the disease on tissues other than the phloem. Root tissues of sour oranges {{have been found to be}} sensitive;to injury, sincejsweet orange tops grafted directly onto sour orange roots and subsequently inoculated showed the usual tristeza symptoms. Death of rootlets and roots was found to occur not only in infected plants with tolerant tops and non-tolerant rootstocks but also on infected tolerant plants having an inter-stem-graft of non-tolerant sour orange. These observations and those made of root reaction on mechanically ringed plants indicate that although the root tissues of non-tolerant stocks may be sensitive to injury the rootlet and root symptoms are mostly secondary reactions. Tests carried out showed that the tristeza virus was recovered from insect protected sprouts grown at the ends of severed roots of Caipira sweet orange stock thus indicating that the virus was definitely present in the roots of a tolerant rootstock. Previously tristeza has been recognized as being associated with various citrus stock-scion combinations. In the present paper 50 seedling types have been reported as showing tristeza symptoms following heavy aphid inoculation. The symptoms shown by infected seedlings are similar to those shown by non-tolerant stock-scion combinations. Small sweet orange seedlings have been observed to show some symptoms of tristeza following heavy inoculations, but citrus types possessing tolerant tissues have shown a tendency toward recovery from symptom expression. The writers, on the basis of observed plant responses, have discussed the mode of inheritance of the main characteristis involved in plant reaction to tristeza. Some seedling progenies of known crosses between Poncirus trifoliata and sweet oranges (citranges) have been found to permit virus increase as the sweet orange parent does, whereas others behave like P. trifoliata and apparently do not permit virus multiplication. No relationship has been found between the trifoliata leaf-shape and inability to permit virus increase, since some of the hybrids that possess the trifoliata leaves, permit virus multiplication. Backcrosses of citranges to sweet oranges show a tendency to behave like the sweet orange parent. Hybrids between P. trifoliata and grapefruits (citrumelos) have behaved in most cases as the parent P. trifoliata. This seems to indicate that tolerant tissues and inability to permit virus increase are dependent on dominant factors in this type of cross. Hybrids between Citrus reticulata and C. paradisi (tangelos) do not show a clear-cut type of inheritance. Some tangelos behave Uke the mandarin parent, possessing tolerant tissues; others behave like the grapefruit parent indicating possession of non-tolerant tissues. The inability to permit virus increase is a characteristic of little value in a rootstock improvement since tops of most commercial citrus varieties permit virus multiplication. It is pointed out that improvement of citrus rootstock with respect to tristeza should be aimed at combining tolerant tissues such as found in P. trifoliata or hybrids, C. sinensis, C. reticulata, etc., with other favorable characters such as vigor, resistance to gummosis, etc. Field tests showed that {{the reaction of}} infective buds on different rootstocks varies not only according to the tolerance of non-tolerance of the rootstock tissues, but also according to whether the buds themselves belong to types that possess non-tolerant or tolerant tissues. Infective buds of tolerant types, as sweet oranges, when budded on non-tolerant stocks produce a first flush of growth that is apparently healthy, but which later shows disease symptoms. For a period of about two months from date of budding, there is little or no difference between sprouts from healthy or infective buds of tolerant types. In contrast, when infective buds of non-tolerant types are budded on non-tolerant stocks, disease symptoms appear practically as soon as the buds start to grow. Observations indicate that infective buds from tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks usually do not develop symptoms even though the plant is a carrier of the virus. On the other hand observations indicate that infective buds of non-tolerant citrus types when budded on tolerant stocks may at times produce some symptoms. A possible explanation for the above-mentioned reactions is presented and is based on the relation between virus movement and food translocation in the plant. In the study of the relationship of tristeza virus to host tissues, plants composed of a sweet top over sour orange rootstock were allowed to develop two sweet orange branches. One branch of each plant was then ringed and inoculated by the vector. The branch not inoculated did not develop symptoms and 16 months after inoculation, buds were taken from the inoculated and the non-inoculated branches and tested for presence of virus. All buds taken from the inoculated ringed branches were found to be carrying the virus, whereas the buds taken from the other branch of the same plant did not have any virus. This experiment shows that the tristeza virus was not able to move across the ringed portion of the stem during that period, thus indicating that the tristeza virus is probably a phloem virus. Results from extensive buddings of various citrus stocks in the field indicate that buds taken from old sweet orange plants that have been known to be infected for a long time have been found to carry the virus in all buds. On the other hand, tests with buds taken from young plants recently infected, of Duncan grapefruit, sour orange and in some cases of Dancy tangerine and Valencia sweet orange, showed that not all buds were carrying the virus. It is not yet known whether buds that are mature prior to infection may temporarily escape virus invasion or whether citrus types which have non-tolerant tissues may limit to a certain extent complete systemic invasion of the tristeza virus...|$|R
40|$|Mudinhas novas de laranjeira azêda podem ser infetadas com o vírus da {{tristeza}} por meio do afídio vetor da moléstia ou mais fàcilmente por enxertia. Plantas adultas são muitos resistentes, quase imunes. A recuperação do vírus da tristeza de plantas de laranja azeda infetadas é efetuada com facilidade por meio de enxertia e com muita dificuldade por meio do vetor. Os sintomas comumente apresentados por mudinhas de laranja azêda afetadas, consistem em amarelecimento das fôlhas novas, paralisação no crescimento e eventual queda das fôlhas amareladas. Em caso de infecção com estirpes fracas do vírus, os sintomas são menos evidentes e comumente há recuperação. As fôlhas formadas após recuperação, muitas vêzes apresentam palidez de pequenas extensões das nervuras. Os tecidos do floema da laranjeira azêda, abaixo do enxêrto de laranjeira doce infetada, mostram degeneração. Êstes sintomas têm sido utilizados para distinguir a tristeza de outras moléstias que causam declínio da planta. Sintomas de depressões no lenho ("pitting") raramente se manifestam em laranjeira azêda. Não se conhece presentemente nenhuma variedade de laranja azêda tolerante à tristeza, não se podendo, portanto, utilizar êsse cavalo para copas nas quais o vírus da tristeza se multiplica e atinge concentrações elevadas. Entretanto, a laranjeira azeda ainda pode ser usada como cavalo para alguns limões dos tipos Eureka e Siciliano e para a própria laranjeira azêda, em áreas invadidas pela moléstia. Há possibilidade de que o cavalo de azêda possa vir a ser novamente empregado para variedades que usualmente perecem quando nela enxertadas, lançando-se mão de medidas auxiliares como a inoculação prévia da copa com uma estirpe fraca do vírus, pela utilização do tipo de copa com união múltipla, etc. Borbulhas de plantas de laranja azêda afetadas pela tristeza nem sempre encerram o vírus. Borbulhas de plantas afetadas ou de plantas sadias se desenvolvem mais ou menos satisfatòriamente quando sôbre-enxertadas em galhos de laranjeira doce sobre laranjeira azêda, já em avançado estado de declínio. Uma copa mista de laranjeiras azêda e doce sôbre cavalo de azêda pode causar alguns benefícios à planta afetada pela tristeza sob determinadas condições, mas êsse benefício não é duradouro e o método não oferece possibilidades práticas. A laranjeira azêda em viveiro tem sido utilizada com vantagem na determinação da presença do vírus da tristeza em borbulhas de vários tipos de Citrus, pela observação do crescimento feito a partir dessas borbulhas em comparação com aquêle de borbulhas da mesma variedade garantidamente sadias. Para a determinação da presença de estirpes fracas do vírus o método é mais demorado. Interenxertos de laranjeira azêda entre copas e raízes de laranjeira doce são suficientes para que haja manifestação de sintomas da moléstia. Há aparentemente alguma translocação através do interenxêrto, pois o desenvolvimento do cavalo abaixo e acima dele é aproximadamente igual. Young {{sour orange}} seedlings {{are more easily}} infected with the tristeza virus by approach-grafts than {{by means of the}} aphid vector. Under natural conditions adult plants in the field are highly resistant to infection by the aphid vector. Recovery of the tristeza virus from infected sour orange plants is also more easily accomplished by tissue union than by means of the aphid vector. Sour orange seedlings show yellowing of young leaves followed by stunting and shedding of leaves when infected with the ordinary strain of the tristeza virus in Brazil. These symptoms do not differ from those described for seedling yellows. The symptoms of leaf yellowing are less evident in plants infected with mild strains of the tristeza virus and there is subsequent recovery. New flushes of young leaves may show occasional vein dashes. Sour orange tissues below the bud union of the sweet orange onsour orange rootstock show phloem degeneration when the plant is affected with tristeza. These degeneration symptoms have been used to distinguish tristeza disease from other decline diseases that affect the same stock-scion combination. Over 45 varieties of sour oranges have been tried as rootstocks for tristeza infected sweet orange tops and they all behaved as non-tolerant rootstocks. So far no tristeza tolerant sour orange rootstock is known, but it seems entirely possible that crosses between sour orange and tristeza-tolerant citrus varieties may yield F 1 hydrids that combine the desirable characteristics of the sour orange rootstock with tristeza tolerant tissues. In case such an F 1 hybrid produced large number of nucellar seedlings these could be used as rootstocks. Sour orange varieties can be used as rootstocks for commercial acid lemons or sour orange tops even in areas where tristeza is present. There is as slight possibility that if a somewhat tolerant sour orange is found, it might be used a 3 rootstock for grapefruits, sweet orange, mandarin, and other tristeza susceptible tops if complementary controlling measures are employed such as protective inoculation of the scion with mild strains of the virus, use of multiple bud union, etc. Tests have shown that buds from a single budstick taken from a tristeza infected sour orange plant may produce healthy and diseased tops when budded on a sour orange rootstock, thus indicating that tristeza virus was not present in all buds of the infected plant. It has been observed that commercial acid lemon and sour orange buds make satisfactory growth when top worked on tristeza-diseased sweet orange tops on sour orange rootstocks. Attempts have been made to control tristeza disease in sweet orange on sour orange rootstock by inducing the rootstock to develop sprouts and thus produce a sour orange top that would supply sinthates for the roots. The presence of this composite sweet orange and sour orange top may be of benefit to the plant when it is infected by tristeza, but this effect is not lasting and the method has been unsuccessful when tried in commercial orchards in Brazil. Sour orange seedlings in nursery rows have been used in Brazil to determine the presence of the ordinary strains of the tristeza virus in budwood from many citrus varieties. In this "sour test" the growth of buds to be tested has been compared with the growth of healthy buds of the same variety. <b>Intergrafts</b> of sour orange stem between a sweet orange top and a sweet orange rootstock were sufficient to induce the plants to show tristeza symptoms when infected. Three, 10, and 80 - 100 cm <b>intergrafts</b> were tried and even the 3 cm <b>intergraft</b> was enough to cause injury in the infected plants. When sweet orange was budded with a multiple union, i. e. on three or four upper branches of sour orange plants there was less apparent injury from tristeza virus infection than in case of a single bud union...|$|R
