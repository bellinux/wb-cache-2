5|$|Following the 1979 Islamic {{revolution}} in Iran, in 1981 Bahraini Shī'a fundamentalists orchestrated a failed coup attempt {{under the auspices}} of a <b>front</b> <b>organisation,</b> the Islamic Front for the Liberation of Bahrain. The coup would have installed a Shī'a cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjatu l-Islām Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. In December 1994, a group of youths threw stones at female runners during an international marathon for running bare-legged. The resulting clash with police soon grew into civil unrest.|$|E
5|$|The {{negotiations}} were first mentioned publicly in 1949 when Stephen Clissold published his Whirlwind: An Account of Marshal Tito's Rise to Power. This was closely followed by Wilhelm Höttl's Die Geheime <b>Front,</b> <b>Organisation,</b> Personen und Aktionen des deutschen Geheimdienstes (The Secret Front, the Organisation, People and Activities of the German Secret Service) in 1950. There was another mention {{in a book}} published in German in 1956, Generalmajor Rudolf Kiszling's Die Kroaten. Der Schicksalsweg eines Südslawenvolkes (The Croats: The Fateful Path of the South Slav People). Ilija Jukić obtained evidence from German Foreign Ministry sources, which he included in his 1965 book Pogledi na prošlost, sadašnjost i budućnost hrvatskog narodna (Views on the Past, Present and Future of the Croatian Nation), published in London. In 1967, the Yugoslav historian Mišo Leković was officially commissioned to produce a full report on the talks. In 1969, Ivan Avakumović published his Mihailović prema nemačkim dokumentima (Mihailović according to German documents), which used captured German military documents.|$|E

25|$|The Workers and Peasants Party (WPP) was a {{political}} party in India, which worked inside the Indian National Congress 1925-1929. It became an important <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> for the Communist Party of India and an influential force in the Bombay labour movement. The party was able to muster some success in making alliances with other left elements inside the Congress Party, amongst them Jawaharlal Nehru. However, as the Communist International entered its 'Third Period' phase, the communists deserted the WPP project. The WPP was wound up, as its leadership was arrested by the British authorities in March 1929.|$|E
25|$|In 1982 Sivaram {{joined the}} Gandhian Movement, then a <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> for the People's Liberation Organisation of Tamil Eelam (PLOTE), {{one of the}} many Tamil organisations. After Sri Lanka's ethnic {{conflict}} erupted into civil war in 1983, Sivaram, under the alias SR, soon became a PLOTE militant. In 1988, a year after the Indo-Lankan accord was signed, Uma Maheswaran, PLOTE's leader, appointed Sivaram General Secretary of the Democratic People's Liberation Front (DPLF), the organisation's registered political party. Sivaram left PLOTE in 1989, after disagreeing with Maheswaran's attempts to establish firmer relations with the Sinhala nationalist Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and because of group's involvement in an abortive coup in the Maldives.|$|E

25|$|During the 1960s and 1970s, La Trobe and Monash were {{considered}} {{to have the most}} politically active student bodies of any university in Australia. The Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist) was a prominent organisation on campus, often with the cover of a <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> sometimes encouraging the name 'La Trot'. The following La Trobe alumni were all good friends at the time and took part in student politics: Bill Kelty from the ACTU and Australian Football League Commissioner, former Treasurer Tony Sheehan, Don Watson, Geoff Walsh (Bob Hawke's press secretary), High-profile union officials Brian Boyd, John Cummins and Garry Weaven, former federal treasury official and former Westpac CEO, David Morgan. Some other Labor figures and people from the left side of politics include Mary Delahunty, Phil Cleary and Michael Danby. Despite the general socialist/leftist atmosphere several conservative corporate/business figures and Liberal Party members have come from La Trobe.|$|E

The coup would have {{installed}} a Shia cleric exiled in Iran, Hujjat al-Islam Hādī al-Mudarrisī, as supreme leader heading a theocratic government. The Bahraini government unofficially regarded the coup as Iran attempting to overthrow their Sunni government. Iran denied all knowledge saying the fundamentalists were inspired by the Iranian revolution but had received no support from Iran. Fearful of a recurrence, the episode caused Bahrain to crack down on its Shia population putting thousands into jail and further souring relations with Shia Iran. Recently the countries are beginning to enjoy closer relations again and have engaged in many joint economic ventures. Iran has been severely critical of Bahrain hosting the US navy Fifth Fleet within the Persian Gulf.|$|E
25|$|LTTE had {{developed}} a large international network {{since the days of}} N. S. Krishnan, who served as its first international representative. In the late 1970s, TULF parliamentarian and opposition leader A. Amirthalingam provided letters of reference for fundraising, and V. N. Navaratnam, who was an executive committee member of the Inter-Parliamentary Union (IPU), introduced many influential and wealthy Tamils living overseas to Tamil insurgent leaders. Navaratnam also introduced LTTE members to the members of Polisario Front, a national liberation movement in Morocco, at a meeting held in Oslo, Norway. In 1978, during the world tour of Amirthalingam (with London-based Eelam activist S. K. Vaikundavasan), he formed the World Tamil Coordinating Committee (WTCC), which was later found to be an LTTE <b>front</b> <b>organisation.</b> The global contacts of LTTE grew steadily since then. At the height of its power, LTTE had 42 offices worldwide. The international network of LTTE engages in propaganda, fundraising, arms procurement, and shipping.|$|E

500|$|An African {{nationalist}} movement {{developed in the}} Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the évolués. The movement was divided {{into a number of}} parties and groups which were broadly divided on ethnic and geographical lines and opposed to one another. The largest, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), was a united <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> dedicated to achieving independence [...] "within a reasonable" [...] time. It was created around a charter which was signed by, among others, Patrice Lumumba, Cyrille Adoula and Joseph Iléo, but others accused the party of being too moderate.

500|$|Further {{conspiracy}} theories {{were reported in}} the 2006 non-fiction book The Sion Revelation: The Truth About the Guardians of Christ's Sacred Bloodline by Lynn Picknett and Clive Prince (authors of the 1997 non-fiction book The Templar Revelation, the principal source for Dan Brown's claims about hidden messages {{in the work of}} Leonardo da Vinci). They accepted that the pre-1956 history of the Priory of Sion was a hoax created by Plantard, and that his claim that he was a Merovingian dynast was a lie. However, they insist that this was part of a complex red herring intended to distract the public from the hidden agenda of Plantard and his [...] "controllers". They argue that the Priory of Sion was a <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> for one of the many crypto-political societies which have been plotting to create a [...] "United States of Europe" [...] in line with French occultist Alexandre Saint-Yves d'Alveydre's synarchist vision of an ideal form of government.|$|E
500|$|An African {{nationalist}} movement {{developed in the}} Belgian Congo during the 1950s, primarily among the black middle-class évolués.

The largest, the Mouvement National Congolais (MNC), was a united <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> dedicated to achieving independence [...] "within a reasonable" [...] time and was led by, among others, Patrice Lumumba. The MNC's main rival was the Alliance des Bakongo (ABAKO), led by Joseph Kasa-Vubu, who advocated a more radical ideology than the MNC, based around calls for immediate independence and the promotion of regional identity. In the aftermath of rioting in the capital Léopoldville (modern-day Kinshasa) in 1959, the independence of the Congo was agreed at the 30 June 1960 and a constitution (loi fondamentale) was agreed, creating a semi-presidential constitution. Kasa-Vubu was proclaimed President, and Lumumba Prime Minister.|$|E

50|$|The SKP did not {{participate}} in any elections with its own name. Instead, <b>front</b> <b>organisations</b> were used. In the 1920s the communists took part in the Socialist Workers' Party of Finland (1920-1923) and the Socialist Electoral Organisation of Workers and Smallholders (1924-1930). Both were banned by the state. In 1944, a new front, Finnish People's Democratic League was formed. The SKP controlled these fronts but they always had a prominent minority of non-communist socialists.|$|R

2500|$|In December 2006, it was {{revealed}} that a Guardian journalist, Ian Cobain, had worked undercover in the BNP for seven months, becoming the party's central London organiser. Among the accusations made by the paper was that the BNP used [...] "techniques of secrecy and deception... in its attempt to conceal its activities and intentions from the public". It asserted that the BNP operated with a [...] "network of false identities" [...] and organised rendezvous points to allow members to be directed to [...] "clandestine meetings". Party members were directed to avoid [...] "any racist or anti-semitic language in public". Cobain also claimed that the membership in central London had expanded beyond the party's traditional range, now including [...] "dozens of company directors, computing entrepreneurs, bankers and estate agents, and a handful of teachers". Following the report, the campaign group Unite Against Fascism called for ballerina Simone Clarke to be dismissed from the English National Ballet, because her views on immigration were [...] "incompatible with a leading arts institution such as the English National Ballet" [...] and because she had [...] "used her position to support a party which fosters division". Clarke said: [...] "the BNP is the only party to take a stand against immigration". The BNP was investigated by the Electoral Commission in 2007, after The Guardian revealed that it had set up a <b>front</b> <b>organisation</b> to raise money from sympathisers in the United States. Later in 2007, three BNP councillors resigned. In Epping, Terry Farr resigned after suspension for writing abusive letters to Trevor Phillips. In Sandwell, James Lloyd was disqualified for not attending any meetings. In Blackburn, Robin Evans left the party and wrote a letter to his former colleagues denouncing it as a party of drug-dealers and football hooligans. Evans remains a councillor, describing himself as a [...] "national socialist".|$|E
2500|$|A {{study done}} in 1953 showed {{that of the}} 42,000 people who had survived the Buchenwald {{concentration}} camp, only 700 were entitled to compensation under the 1953 law. The German historian Alf Lüdtke wrote {{that the decision to}} deny that the Roma and the Sinti had been victims of National Socialist racism and to exclude the Roma and Sinti from compensation under the grounds that they were all [...] "criminals" [...] reflected the same anti-Gypsy racism that made them the target of persecution and genocide during the National Socialist era. The cause of the Roma and Sinti excited so little public interest that it was not until 1979 that a group was founded to lobby for compensation for the Roma and the Sinti survivors. Communist concentration camp survivors were excluded from compensation under the grounds that in 1933 the KPD had been seeking [...] "violent domination" [...] by working for a Communist revolution, and thus the banning of the KPD and the subsequent repression of the Communists were justified. In 1956, the law was amended to allow Communist concentration camp survivors to collect compensation provided that they had not been associated with Communist causes after 1945, but as almost all the surviving Communists belonged to the Union of Persecutees of the Nazi Regime, which had been banned in 1951 by the Hamburg government [...] as a Communist <b>front</b> <b>organisation,</b> the new law did not help many of the KPD survivors. Compensation started to be paid to most Communist survivors regardless if they had belonged to the VVN or not following a 1967 court ruling, through the same court ruling had excluded those Communists who had [...] "actively" [...] fought the constitutional order after the banning of the KPD again in 1956. Only in the 1980s were demands made mostly from members of the SPD, FDP and above all the Green parties that the Federal Republic pay compensation to the Roma, Sinti, gay, homeless and Asoziale survivors of the concentration camps.|$|E
