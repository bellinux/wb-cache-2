25|$|There are {{two basic}} types of LCA data – unit process data and {{environmental}} <b>input-output</b> data (EIO), where the latter is based on national economic <b>input-output</b> data. Unit process data are derived from direct surveys of companies or plants producing the product of interest, carried out at a unit process level defined by the system boundaries for the study.|$|E
25|$|The two-element Boolean algebra is {{also used}} for circuit design in {{electrical}} engineering; here 0 and 1 represent the two different states of one bit in a digital circuit, typically high and low voltage. Circuits are described by expressions containing variables, and two such expressions are equal for all values of the variables {{if and only if}} the corresponding circuits have the same <b>input-output</b> behavior. Furthermore, every possible <b>input-output</b> behavior can be modeled by a suitable Boolean expression.|$|E
25|$|In the {{multi-sector}} approach (<b>input-output</b> model), {{changes in}} the technological index are related to aggregate sectoral technological change and to {{the difference in the}} growth rates across sectors.|$|E
25|$|In applied economics, <b>input-output</b> models {{employing}} {{linear programming}} methods are quite common. Large {{amounts of data}} are run through computer programs to analyse the impact of certain policies; IMPLAN is one well-known example.|$|E
25|$|Non-linear <b>input-output</b> relationship: The {{output voltage}} {{may not be}} {{accurately}} proportional {{to the difference between}} the input voltages. It is commonly called distortion when the input signal is a waveform. This effect will be very small in a practical circuit where substantial negative feedback is used.|$|E
25|$|Some {{advocates of}} homeschooling and {{educational}} choice counter with an <b>input-output</b> theory, {{pointing out that}} home educators expend only an average of $500–$600 a year on each student, in comparison to $9,000-$10,000 for each public school student in the United States, which suggests home-educated students would be especially dominant on tests if afforded access to an equal commitment of tax-funded educational resources.|$|E
25|$|The German {{transformation}} controversy {{helped to}} inspire Wassily Leontief's <b>input-output</b> economics (Bortkiewicz co-supervised the young Leontief's doctoral studies together with Werner Sombart) but it remained a relatively obscure academic dispute, until Paul Sweezy {{drew attention to}} it in his widely read 1942 book The Theory of Capitalist Development. Bortkiewicz's interpretation of Marx was very influential {{in the second half}} of the 20th century, in Marxist, neo-Ricardian and Post-Keynesian circles.|$|E
25|$|He {{returned}} to Harvard in 1945, and studied under Wassily Leontief. As his research assistant he produced {{the first set}} of capital-coefficients for the <b>input–output</b> model. Then he became interested in statistics and probability models. From 1949–50, he spent a fellowship year at Columbia University to study statistics more intensively. During that year he was also working on his Ph.D. thesis, an exploratory attempt to model changes in the size distribution of wage income using interacting Markov processes for employment-unemployment and wage rates.|$|E

25|$|A SDIO (Secure Digital Input Output) card is an {{extension}} of the SD specification to cover I/O functions. SDIO cards are only fully functional in host devices designed to support their <b>input-output</b> functions (typically PDAs like the Palm Treo, but occasionally laptops or mobile phones). These devices can use the SD slot to support GPS receivers, modems, barcode readers, FM radio tuners, TV tuners, RFID readers, digital cameras, and interfaces to Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, Ethernet, and IrDA. Many other SDIO devices have been proposed, but it is now more common for I/O devices to connect using the USB interface.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{mathematical}} logic to represent and execute computer programs {{is also a}} feature of the lambda calculus, developed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s. However, the first proposal to use the clausal form of logic for representing computer programs was made by Cordell Green. This used an axiomatization of a subset of LISP, together with a representation of an <b>input-output</b> relation, to compute the relation by simulating the execution of the program in LISP. Foster and Elcock's Absys, on the other hand, employed a combination of equations and lambda calculus in an assertional programming language which places no constraints on the order in which operations are performed.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} econometric work, Measuring the Wealth of Nations, {{was published}} by Anwar Shaikh and Ertuğrul Ahmet Tonak in 1994. This work sought to reaggregate the components of official gross output measures rigorously, to approximate Marxian categories, using some new techniques, including <b>input-output</b> measures of direct and indirect labor, and capacity utilization adjustments. Shaikh and Tonak argued that the falling rate of profit is not a short-term trend of the business cycle, but a long-term historical trend. According to their calculations, the Marxian rate of profit on production capital fell {{throughout most of the}} long boom of 1947–1973, despite an enormous expansion of the volume (mass) of profit.|$|E
25|$|Economic <b>input–output</b> LCA (EIOLCA) {{involves}} use of aggregate sector-level data on {{how much}} environmental impact {{can be attributed to}} each sector of the economy and how much each sector purchases from other sectors. Such analysis can account for long chains (for example, building an automobile requires energy, but producing energy requires vehicles, and building those vehicles requires energy, etc.), which somewhat alleviates the scoping problem of process LCA; however, EIOLCA relies on sector-level averages {{that may or may not}} be representative of the specific subset of the sector relevant to a particular product and therefore is not suitable for evaluating the environmental impacts of products. Additionally the translation of economic quantities into environmental impacts is not validated.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand, some {{researchers}} hypothesize that the enrichment of network motifs is non-adaptive. In other words, gene regulatory networks can evolve {{to a similar}} structure without the specific selection on the proposed <b>input-output</b> behavior. Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of feed-forward loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly rewiring nodes may suggest that the enrichment of feed-forward loops is a side-effect of evolution. In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, {{the ratio of the}} frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of feed-forward loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks.|$|E
25|$|While which {{specific}} {{system is}} considered the first microcomputer {{is a matter of}} debate, as there were several unique hobbyist systems developed based on the Intel 4004 and its successor, the Intel 8008, the first commercially available microcomputer kit was the Intel 8080-based Altair 8800, which was announced in the January 1975 cover article of Popular Electronics. However, this was an extremely limited system in its initial stages, having only 256 bytes of DRAM in its initial package and no <b>input-output</b> except its toggle switches and LED register display. Despite this, it was initially surprisingly popular, with several hundred sales in the first year, and demand rapidly outstripped supply. Several early third-party vendors such as Cromemco and Processor Technology soon began supplying additional S-100 bus hardware for the Altair 8800.|$|E
25|$|The <b>input-output</b> {{equations}} {{could be}} made to work, only if additional assumptions were made. But even in a dynamic model, it can be shown mathematically that assumptions (1), (3) and (4) have a crippling effect on the plausibility of longterm quantitative results obtained with the model. However, what ought to be concluded from this modelling exercise, still remains very much in dispute (is the theory wrong, are the concepts and assumptions wrong, is the interpretation of the concepts wrong, is there a big difference between the model and the real world, etc.). The math of the classical transformation problem is rather simple; the real difficulty is about whether the economic relationships involved are adequately conceptualized, and how we could know that. Both Marx and von Bortkiewicz implicitly admitted that assumptions (1), (3), (4) and (5) cannot be true in the real world, and this casts doubt on the importance or relevance of the classical transformation problem.|$|E

500|$|Feminist economists {{point out}} three main ways of {{determining}} the value of unpaid work: the opportunity cost method, replacement cost method, and <b>input-output</b> cost method. [...] The opportunity cost method [...] "uses the wage a person would earn in the market" [...] {{to see how much}} value their labor-time has. This method extrapolates from the opportunity cost idea in mainstream economics.|$|E
500|$|The third {{method is}} the <b>input-output</b> cost method. [...] This looks {{at both the}} costs of inputs and {{includes}} any value added by the household. [...] "For instance, the value of time devoted to cooking a meal can be determined by asking what it could cost to purchase a similar meal (the output) in the market, then subtracting {{the cost of the}} capital goods, utilities and raw materials devoted to that meal. This remainder represents the value of the other factors of production, primarily labor." [...] These types of models try to value household output by determining monetary values for the inputs [...] in the dinner example, the ingredients and production of the meal [...] and compares those with market equivalents.|$|E
500|$|In 1936, the Russian–born {{economist}} Wassily Leontief {{built his}} model of <b>input-output</b> analysis from the 'material balance' tables constructed by Soviet economists, which themselves followed earlier {{work by the}} physiocrats. [...] With his model, which described a system of production and demand processes, Leontief described how changes in demand in one economic sector would influence production in another. In practice, Leontief [...] estimated the coefficients of his simple models, to address economically interesting questions. [...] In production economics, [...] "Leontief technologies" [...] produce outputs using constant proportions of inputs, regardless {{of the price of}} inputs, reducing the value of Leontief models for understanding economies but allowing their parameters to be estimated relatively easily. In contrast, the von Neumann model of an expanding economy allows for choice of techniques, but the coefficients must be estimated for each technology.|$|E

The <b>input-output</b> differential at which the voltage regulator will no longer maintain regulation is the dropout voltage. Further reduction in input voltage will result in reduced output voltage. [...] This value is dependent on load current and junction temperature.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{technological}} theory of social production, {{the growth of}} output, measured [...] in money units, is related to achievements in technological consumption of labour and energy. [...] This theory is based on concepts of classical political economy and neo-classical economics {{and appears to be}} a generalisation of the known economic models, such as the neo-classical model of economic growth and <b>input-output</b> model.|$|E
2500|$|Mathematical {{modeling}} is {{a powerful}} tool that is used in ecological economic analysis. Various approaches and techniques include: evolutionary, <b>input-output,</b> neo-Austrian modeling, entropy and thermodynamic models, multi-criteria, and agent-based modeling, the environmental Kuznets curve, and Stock-Flow consistent model frameworks. System dynamics and GIS are techniques applied, among other, to spatial dynamic landscape simulation modeling.

Together with Herbert A. Simon, he discovered and proved the Hawkins–Simon theorem on the [...] "conditions for the existence of positive solution vectors for <b>input-output</b> matrices." [...] This macroeconomic theorem helped economists better understand the interconnectedness of various sectors of an economy.|$|E
2500|$|Georgescu's {{model of}} the economy grew out of his dissatisfaction with neoclassical {{production}} theory {{as well as the}} <b>input-output</b> {{model of the}} economy, developed by Nobel Prize laureate Wassily Leontief. Georgescu realised that production cannot be adequately described by stocks of equipment and inventories only; or by flows of inputs and outputs only. It was necessary to combine these two descriptions. In order to complete the picture, it was also necessary to add the new concept of a 'fund'.|$|E
2500|$|From 1950 to 1955, Simon studied {{mathematical}} {{economics and}} during this time, together with David Hawkins, discovered and proved the Hawkins–Simon theorem on the “conditions {{for the existence}} of positive solution vectors for <b>input-output</b> matrices." [...] He also developed theorems on near-decomposability and aggregation. Having begun to apply these theorems to organizations, by 1954 Simon determined {{that the best way to}} study problem-solving was to simulate it with computer programs, which led to his interest in computer simulation of human cognition. Founded during the 1950s, he was among the first members of the Society for General Systems Research.|$|E
2500|$|Scheme's {{input and}} output {{is based on the}} port datatype. (R5RS sec 6.6) [...] R5RS defines two default ports, {{accessible}} with the procedures current-input-port and current-output-port, which correspond to the Unix notions of standard input and standard output. Most implementations also provide current-error-port. Redirection of input and standard output is supported in the standard, by standard procedures such as with-input-from-file and with-output-to-file. [...] Most implementations provide string ports with similar redirection capabilities, enabling many normal <b>input-output</b> operations to be performed on string buffers instead of files, using procedures described in SRFI 6. The R6RS standard specifies much more sophisticated and capable port procedures and many new types of port.|$|E
2500|$|If {{the values}} and prices of goods can vary {{independently}} {{in all kinds of}} ways, then the classical revolutionary orthodox Marxist principle that total production prices are equal to total product values cannot, realistically, be true; there exists no causal mechanism by which such price-value fluctuations perfectly compensate each other in aggregate, so that total product values equal total production prices. The principle can then be true only in an abstract theoretical model, but not in reality. Yet, if that classical revolutionary orthodox core principle is not true in reality, then it seems to follow there cannot be any systematic relationship in the real world between the Marxist labor-values and the actual price-levels for products – which was precisely what critics argued during the 20th century about the insolubility of the transformation problem. If the Marxian product values are really determinants of product-prices, {{is there a way to}} express that relationship, other than as an accounting consolidation, or as a simultaneous <b>input-output</b> equation? There is no consensus about that issue among mathematicians and computer scientists, although the main trend is now toward probabilistic analysis and vector algebra. Many mathematical Marxists have abandoned Marx's analysis of the equalization of the rate of profit and Marx's concept of production prices, arguing that an analysis of <b>input-output</b> data can straightforwardly prove a strong, robust positive correlation between product-prices and employee hours worked. They argue, with Marx, that a uniform profit rate does not exist in reality, but against Marx that, therefore, a tendency for differences in profit rates to be levelled out by competition does not exist either. Since (they argue) the deviation of product-prices from product-values is not very great in reality, the law of value is an empirical law with predictive power. At least for output aggregates, this is quite easy to prove, since net value-added (gross labour compensation earned and paid + gross profits earned and paid, net of write-offs) is by definition strongly correlated with the total amount of labour hours worked. [...] This analysis does not, however, refer to foreign trade.|$|E
2500|$|In modern mathematics, a {{function}} {{is defined by}} its set of inputs, called the domain; a set containing the set of outputs, and possibly additional elements, as members, called its codomain (or target); and the set of all <b>input-output</b> pairs, called its graph. Sometimes the codomain is called the function's [...] "range", but more commonly the word [...] "range" [...] is used to mean, instead, specifically the set of outputs (this is also called {{the image of the}} function). For example, we could define {{a function}} using the rule [...] by saying that the domain and codomain are the real numbers, and that the graph consists of all pairs of real numbers [...] [...] The image of this function is the set of non-negative real numbers. [...] Collections of functions with the same domain and the same codomain are called function spaces, the properties of which are studied in such mathematical disciplines as real analysis, complex analysis, and functional analysis.|$|E
2500|$|Applied Economics is the {{application}} of economic theory and econometrics in specific settings. As {{one of the two}} sets of fields of economics (the other set being the core), it is typically characterized by {{the application}} of the core, i.e. economic theory and econometrics, to address practical issues in a range of fields including [...] demographic economics, labour economics, business economics, industrial organization, agricultural economics, development economics, education economics, health economics, monetary economics, public economics, and economic history. The process often involves a reduction in the level of abstraction of this core theory. There are a variety of approaches including not only empirical estimation using econometrics, <b>input-output</b> analysis or simulations but also case studies, historical analogy and so-called common sense or the [...] "vernacular". [...] This range of approaches is indicative of what Roger Backhouse and Jeff Biddle argue is the ambiguous nature of the concept of applied economics. It is a concept with multiple meanings. Among broad methodological distinctions, one source places it in neither positive nor normative economics but the art of economics, glossed as [...] "what most economists do".|$|E

With the <b>input-output</b> table, one can estimate the change in demand for inputs resulting from a change in production of the final good. The analysis assumes that input proportions are fixed; thus the use of <b>input-output</b> analysis is limited to rough approximations rather than prediction. <b>Input-output</b> was novel and inspired large-scale empirical work; in 2010 its iterative method was recognized as an early intellectual precursor to Google's PageRank.|$|E
