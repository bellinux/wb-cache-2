Its purpose was [...] "to induce among ladies the habit of devoting some part of every day to study of a systematic and thorough kind.". It was loosely based upon the English Society for the Encouragement of Home Study though it differed from that institution {{in a number of}} respects. The English society extended its benefits only to upper class women of leisure whereas the American society served women of all classes and specifically sought to serve women who were already busy with chores of the home, showing how they might profitably use their time for study and enlightenment. Further, the English society provided only a standard curriculum and students were expected to complete the course work on their own. The American society provided individually planned courses and constant interactive communications between instructors and students. Finally, the English society required its students to travel to London to take a final competitive examination. The American society with its <b>individualized</b> <b>teaching</b> plans dispensed with this formality judging it impractical due to the geographic distances between instructors and students and recognizing the limited financial means of many of its students.|$|E

40|$|A major {{challenge}} for teachers in crowded classrooms is {{to adapt the}} teaching to different pupil’s needs and abilities. Previous research shows that learning for pupils in the Swedish primary school has somewhat become an individual project. An increase in the individual work {{has been at the}} expense of whole class teaching. This has had a negative impact on pupils' academic performance. However, previous research also indicates that individual adaptation may affect results positively when the teacher is active, has knowledge of pupil’s needs and abilities and also a willingness to meet them. In the last few versions of the Swedish curriculum it is mentioned that teaching should be adjusted based on each pupil's abilities and needs. The {{purpose of this study is}} to investigate, describe and analyze how today's teachers in primary school (grades 1 - 6) handle individual adaptation in teaching, what strategies they use and what dilemmas that occurs. The study focuses on how work is carried out in practice. Qualitative interviews and participant observations are used in the data collection. This study has been conducted in two parts. The first part addresses five teachers and their classes in four different schools. In the second part the study has been extended with one of the above teachers whose classroom work was followed during a period of seven weeks. The results show that teachers are working hard to find methods that promote communication and interaction. They use different strategies to adapt teaching to each student. Individual work is still present but does not dominate the classroom work. Teachers <b>individualize</b> <b>teaching</b> by variation and interaction, by working together with tasks, with active relationship-oriented work and through continuous adjustments in the moment. The study also shows that teachers face several dilemmas when they <b>individualize</b> <b>teaching</b> in the classroom. One dilemma is among the ideal adaptation that teachers have a vision of, versus the time- and efficiencydriven adaptation that is possible to accomplish in the classroom. There is a tension between overall ideal images and teachers' practical everyday reality...|$|R

40|$|AbstractIt {{is obvious}} {{that in the last}} decades {{important}} efforts have been made to orientate the teaching-learning activities towards differentiation and individualization. Also, empiric researches have been carried out to prove the advantages of a differentiated and individualized education compared to the traditional education, which, in most of the cases, still remains a collective or frontal type of education. Approaches have been made for training the teachers who would possess the necessary skills for the good organization of the differentiated and <b>individualized</b> <b>teaching,</b> and great efforts have also been made for the learning institutions’ modernization and endowment, so that they would meet the demands required by the differentiated and <b>individualized</b> <b>teaching.</b> Despite all these advantages and positive followings attached to the differentiated and <b>individualized</b> <b>teaching,</b> we should not bet on a single card and consider that the efficiency of the whole instructive-educative process can be obtained only by the obsessive promotion of the debated modalities. Being aware of the risks of such one-dimensional approach, we will try to show in this paper how good results in mathematics learning can be obtained, if this subject benefits from a correct differentiation and individualization...|$|E

40|$|One of {{the biggest}} {{challenges}} for primary school teachers in today's schools is to teach students to read.

But it also seeks to identify possibilities and difficulties teachers face in connection with this to illustrate what may be the basis for teachers' equal / different views and actions in the field. This is illustrated by four research questions of the study, which are: 1) How do teacher <b>individualize</b> reading in <b>teaching</b> Swedish as a second language? 2) What considerations are the basis for the teachers in primary schools planning of <b>individualized</b> reading in <b>teaching</b> Swedish as a second language? 3) What opportunities and difficulties do teachers see within <b>individualized</b> reading in <b>teaching</b> Swedish as a second language? 4) How is individualized reading expressed in primary school teachers teaching in Swedish as a second language? Through qualitative interviews and observations, the results show that teachers use multiple individualization types and components of literacy development for the individualization of reading in their teaching in Swedish as a second language? Some of the teachers feel, however, that the structural conditions at the school prevents them from doing this fully. A central and common aspect is that teachers use level individualization as a basis for any kind of individualization. ...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{majority}} of cancer treatment {{is provided in}} outpatient settings. Family caregivers’ (FCs’) knowledge and beliefs about pain and its management are critical components of effective care. Objective: This study’s aim was to evaluate the efficacy of a psychoeducational intervention, compared with control, to increase FCs’ knowledge of cancer pain management. Intervention/Methods: Family caregivers of oncology outpatients were randomized together with the patients into the PRO-SELF Pain Control Program (n = 58) or a control group (n = 54). Family caregivers completed a demographic questionnaire and the Family Pain Questionnaire (FPQ) {{at the beginning and}} end of the study to assess their knowledge about pain and its management. The intervention consisted of nurse coaching, home visits, and phone calls that occurred over 6 weeks. Results: One hundred twelve FCs (60 % female) with a mean age of 63 (SD, 10. 7) years participated. Compared with FCs in the control group, FCs in the PRO-SELF group had significantly higher knowledge scores on all of the single items on the FPQ, except for the item ‘‘cancer pain can be relieved,’’ as well as for the total FPQ score. Conclusion: The use of a knowledge and attitude survey like the FPQ, as part of a psychoeducational intervention provides an effective foundation for FC education about cancer pain management. Implications for Practice: Oncology nurses can use FCs’ responses to the FPQ to <b>individualize</b> <b>teaching</b> and spend more time on identified knowledge deficits.

40|$|An {{instructional}} materials program {{is an integral}} part of a quality educational program. The educational goal of our free society is to provide a quality education for every citizen and an optimum education for each citizen so that all citizens will be functionally literate. In our complex society, to be functionally literate means more than being able to read and to write. It means being able to read, to write, to think, and to act with competence. To think and to act with competence means being capable of translating knowledge into constructive action and rational behavior. It also means being capable of solving the problems encountered today and being capable of solving adequately the problems to be encountered in the future. To develop such competence is the purpose and the goal of education in our democracy. To reach this goal necessitates the availability of knowledge-building and knowledge-extending materials and a planned program for media-usage. A quality, optimum educational program designed to develop functional literacy requires that learning go beyond the limitations of the textbook and the confines of the classroom. An optimum education requires that learning be individualized. A textbook can generalize, but it can not <b>individualize</b> <b>teaching</b> nor can it individualize learning.
