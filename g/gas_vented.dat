In order to lower leachate level in the landfill and to promote stabilization of waste, many passive <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> were installed as well as leachate collection vaults. This study aimed to evaluate the distribution and movement of leachate in the landfill by determining leachate level and tracer test in the <b>gas</b> <b>vents.</b> The water level varied widely among the <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> and depended mainly on the original ground level {{and the depth of}} the vent. Leachate velocity also showed a wide variation. The leachate velocity was high in the upper layers of the saturated zone in a <b>gas</b> <b>vent.</b> However, this is only the superficial velocity caused by an inflow from unsaturated layers.

The HLH has demonstrated the feeding of a range of fuels including wood pellets, torrefied spruce pellets and ground anthracite grains to pressures as high as 25 barg. Two modes of operation have been developed, one whereby the energy requirement to feed is minimised (Mode 1), and another whereby the volume of high pressure <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> to the atmosphere is reduced to near nil (Mode 2).

30|$|Confusion {{may arise}} {{in an attempt}} to relate the effect of BPR with the above definition, as the actual value of Rs is not a {{function}} of casing pressure. In other words, the installation of BPR does not affect the actual value of Rs as defined above. Yet, the restriction of solution gas flow at an intermediate stage increases the amount of dissolved gas, and, therefore, increases the gas solubility at previous stages. Reducing the amount of solution <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> through the casing results in higher gas solubility at wellbore conditions and, therefore, a higher value of Rs. The oil viscosity decreases exponentially with increasing gas solubility when the pressure of interest is below the bubble point pressure (Economides et al. 1994). This reveals that the installation of BPR on casing increases the gas solubility of the oil upstream of the point of installation, followed by the lower oil viscosity. Additionally, the oil viscosity increases with increasing pressure somewhat linearly when the pressure is above the bubble point pressure (McCain 1990). However, this does not imply that the installation of BPR always yields a reverse effect on the oil viscosity when applied to an undersaturated reservoir. If the pressure gradient shows that a pressure becomes lower than the bubble point pressure at a certain point in the reservoir, the effect of lower viscosity commences from that point.|$|E
40|$|Hydrocarbon seeps are {{ubiquitous}} at gas-prone Cenozoic deltas {{such as the}} Nile Deep Sea Fan (NDSF 2) where seepage {{into the}} bottom water has been observed at several mud volcanoes (MVs 3) including North Alex MV (NAMV 4). Here we investigated the sources of hydrocarbon gases and sedimentary organic matter together with biomarkers of microbial activity at four locations of NAMV to constrain how venting at the seafloor relates to the generation of hydrocarbon gases in deeper sediments. At the centre, high upward flux of hot (70 °C) hydrocarbon-rich fluids is indicated by an absence of biomarkers of Anaerobic Oxidation of Methane (AOM) and nearly constant methane (CH 4) concentration depth-profile. The presence of lipids of incompatible thermal maturities points to mixing between early-mature petroleum and immature organic matter, indicating that shallow mud has been mobilized by the influx of deep-sourced hydrocarbon-rich fluids. Methane is enriched in the heavier isotopes, with values of δ 13 C∼− 46. 6 ‰VPDB and δD ∼− 228 ‰VSMOW, and is associated with high amounts of heavier homologues (C 2 +) suggesting a co-genetic origin with the petroleum. On the contrary at the periphery, a lower but sustained CH 4 flux is indicated by deeper sulphate–methane transition zones {{and the presence of}} 13 C-depleted biomarkers of AOM, consistent with predominantly immature organic matter. Values of δ 13 C-CH 4 ∼− 60 ‰VPDB and decreased concentrations of 13 C-enriched C 2 + are typical of mixed microbial CH 4 and biodegraded thermogenic gas from Plio-Pleistocene reservoirs of the region. The maturity of gas condensate migrated from pre-Miocene sources into Miocene reservoirs of the Western NDSF is higher than that of the <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> at the centre of NAMV, supporting the hypothesis that it is rather released from the degradation of oil in Neogene reservoirs. Combined with the finding of hot pore water and petroleum at the centre, our results suggest that clay mineral dehydration of Neogene sediments, which takes place posterior to reservoir filling, may contribute to intense gas generation at high sedimentation rate deltas...|$|E

40|$|To make {{inside of}} the {{municipal}} solid waste (MSW) landfill aerobic {{as much as possible}} is thought to be preferable for promoting waste stabilization, reducing pollutant's load in leachate, minimizing greenhouse gas emission and shortening post-closure-care period. In Japan, installation of semi-aerobic landfill structure has widely spread in order to promote waste stabilization in MSW landfill from 1980 s. In semi-aerobic landfill structure, outlet of main leachate collection pipe is opened to atmosphere. Heat generated by aerobic degradation of waste causes natural convection and natural aeration arises from the outlet of leachate collection pipe to the <b>gas</b> <b>vents.</b> It is so-called stack effect. This air flow is thought to be effective for purifying leachate flowing through drainage layer and leachate collection pipes. And it is also thought to be contributing to expanding aerobic region in waste layer in landfill. Recently, measures attempting the promotion of waste stabilization are taken at several landfills at where stabilization of waste delays, in which many vertical <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are newly installed and close structure to semi-aerobic landfill is created. However, in many cases, these <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are not connected to leachate collection pipes. Many vertical <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> are just installed without scientific proof regarding whether they can contribute for waste stabilization. In this study, how such installation of <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> is effective for waste stabilization and aerobization of waste layer was discussed by numerical analysis. In numerical analysis, heat transfer, gas movement by pressure, gas diffusion, biological degradation of organic matter, and heat generation by biodegradation were taken into account.

30|$|A highly unconsolidated undersaturated {{reservoir}} producing {{heavy oil}} with an API of 12.1 ° {{is located in}} Lindbergh Field of Elk Point area, Alberta, Canada. A specific well in this reservoir was initially designed to produce oil via a cold heavy oil production with sand (CHOPS) mechanism. However, {{a large amount of}} the sand production on a daily basis plugged the progressive cavity pump installed in the well. The cost of well services to unplug the pump on a monthly basis exceeded the revenue from produced oil, and thus, the well was considered uneconomic. Various techniques have been sought to control the sand production and to increase the cumulative oil production and the pump efficiency. Installing screens and meshes in the production interval of the wellbore was analyzed as a solution to the sand production. Installing screens increased the skin factor and resulted in a very low production rate of 0.15  m 3 /day. The cost of purchasing and installing screens was estimated to be approximately $ 87, 650 with five shut-in days. In addition, the screens also needed further sand clean up, which is an expensive process. Hence, the screens were not recommended for this candidate well. A Back-pressure regulator (BPR) is currently installed on the casing of the well. The initial purpose of installing BPR on the casing was to control the wellbore pressure. The BPR restricts the flow of <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> through the casing-tubing annulus. This study analyzes the effects of restricting flow of the vented gas such as solution gas reduction, which causes (i) higher settling velocity for the sand grain, (ii) lower Basic sediment and water (BS&W), and (iii) lower in situ oil density. The production data of candidate well obtained from AccuMap (v. 18.12) shows that the production hours increased significantly after installing BPR. This is because the number of well services reduced by 90  %. This results in an approximately $ 34, 000 per month increase in profit (assuming $ 30.00 /barrel of oil) for each well. This shows one million dollars savings on a monthly basis when the application of the BPR installation is implemented on 30 similar wells. The cost of the BPR installed on well is $ 328.00, and there is no operating cost involved since the cost of additional, necessary maintenance and operation is nearly negligible. Moreover, this study provides the field examples of improper BPR operation, which resulted in economic loss. Possible solutions to fix the improper installation of BPR are proposed as well.|$|E
40|$|The sudden unrest of {{submarine}} {{volcanic activity}} occurred {{off the island}} of Panarea (Aeolian arc) on November 2002 induced a submarine low-energy explosion that opened a “crater” of 20 by 10 meters wide and 7 meters deep. That event dramatically changed the geochemical features and the degassing rate of the submarine hydrothermal vents of the area and pushed the scientists to develop new methods to monitor the sea-floor venting activity. During the unrest period, the huge degassing activity increased the CO 2 flow rate by some orders of magnitude. Apart from the former venting areas, degassing occurred from many new fractures opened at the seafloor along a N 40 °E trend and from the crater. Estimations before the event gave a degassing rate {{in the range of}} 107 litres/day of CO 2, in contrast with the <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> only by the crater, estimated to be in the order of 1 - 2 x 109 l/d CO 2. Such a large amount of toxic gas released to the atmosphere increased the volcanic risk due to the gas hazard. Coupling the information from geochemical investigations and data collected during the unrest of volcanic activity we were able to: a) provide the necessary information to the National Department of Civil Protection to manage the volcanic crisis and b) to develop theoretical models to gain a better insight on the submarine hydrothermal system and its relationships with the local tectonic structures. The measured helium isotopic ratios close to 4. 3 Ra (Ra = atmospheric 3 He/ 4 He ratio), in the range of the values given for the local magmatic signature, did not allow distinguishing if a fresh degassing magma or a cooling crystallized body was feeding the submarine emissions, however the recorded data were the same as measured on the island of Stromboli and underwent synchronous changes with the time. Besides the sampling activity (gases and hot waters collection by diving activity), a continuous monitoring has been carried out by a new sea-floor observatory developed to perform real-time data transmission from a sea-floor multidisciplinary observatory. Among the other sensors, the acoustic probe (hydrophone), installed for a long-term recording of the noise of the bubbling gases in a frequency range of 0. 5 - 3 kHz, gave useful information for a tight link between the submarine volcanic activity of Panarea Island and the crater explosions of the nearby active volcanic island of Stromboli. The continuous monitoring of the submarine hydrothermal vents showing contemporaneous modifications of the vented fluids and the seismic activity of the nearby Stromboli, besides the contemporary variation of the 3 He/ 4 He ratios at both volcanoes, bear testimony to interconnections between the two volcanic islands. The almost contemporary start of the volcanic crisis at Panarea and Stromboli in 2002, together with the large number of submarine crater-shaped structures at Panarea, supports the above outcome too. As a matter of fact, our geochemical approach allowed us: 1) to gain a deeper insight for the management of such an unrest of the submarine volcanic activity results and 2) to recognize that the observed changes in the fluids geochemistry were caused by a magmatic input, as such, the nearby active volcanic system of Stromboli Island is somewhat involved in feeding magmatic fluids to Panarea, probably through the normal N 40 °E fault linking the two edifices...|$|E
40|$|Explosion venting {{technology}} is widely accepted as the effective constructional protection measures against {{gas and dust}} explosions. The key problem in venting is the appropriate design of the vent area necessary for an effective release of the material i. e. the pressure developed during explosion did not cause any damage to the plant protected. Current gas explosion vent design standards in the USA (NFPA 68, 2002) and European (2007) rely on the vent correlation first published by Bartknecht in 1993 (Siwek, 1996). N FPA 68 also recommends the correlation of Swift (Swift, 1983) at low overpressures. For a vent to give no increase in overpressure other than that due to the pressure difference created by the mass flow of unburnt gases through the vent, the vent mass flow rate {{is assumed to be}} equal to the maximum mass burning rate of the flame and this consideration should be used as the design mass flow through the vent. Two different methods (Method I and Method 2) have been proposed based on the Sμ and Sμ (E- 1) to describe the maximum mass burning rate given as, mb = ASμpμ=CdeA(2 pPμred) o. 5 mb =ASgPm =AgSμ(E-I) P μ=Cde 4,(2 pu Pred) 0, 5 (2) The equation given in (2) is slightly different from (1) as is about 6. 5 times the mass flow of the first method as it takes the effect of (E- 1) where E is the expansion ratio. A critical review were carried out for the applicability, validity and limitation on the venting correlations adopted in NFPA 68 and European Standard with 470 literature experimental data, covering a wide range of values for vessel volume and geometries, bursting vent pressure, Pv L/D ratio, maximum reduced pressure, Pred and ignition location. The fuels involved are methane, propane, hydrogen, town gas, ethylene, acetone/air mixtures with the most hazardous near-stoichiornetric fuel-air concentration. Besides, Molkov's equation (Molkov, 2001) which is regarded as alternative venting design offered in NFPA 68 and Bradley and Mitcheson's equation for safe venting design were also analysed on the experimental data for their validity and limitation as well as the proposed methods. From the results, it is clear that Bartknecht's equation gave a satisfactory result with experimental data for K 200 mbar, providing the parameter PV is added into the equation. Method 2 gave a good agreement to most of the experimental data as it followed assumptions applied for correlations given by Bradley and Mitcheson for safe venting design (Bradley and Mitcheson, 1978 a,B radley and Mitcheson, 1978 b). It is also proven that the vent coefficient, K is confident to be used in quantifying the vessel's geometry for cubic vessel and the use of As/Av term is more favourable for non-cubic vessels. To justify the validity and applicability of the proposed methods, series of simply vented experiments were carried out, involving two different cylindrical volumes i. e. 0. 2 and 0. 0065 M 3. It is found that self acceleration plays important role in bigger vessel in determining the final Pmax inside the vessel. Method 2 gave closer prediction on Pmax in respect with other studied correlations. The investigation of vented gas explosion is explored further with the relief pipe been connected to the vessel at different fuel/air equivalence ratios, ignition position and Pv. The results demonstrate that the magnitude of Pmax was increased corresponding to the increase of Pv- From the experiments,it is found that peak pressure with strong acoustic behaviour is observed related to increase in Pv and in some cases,significant detonation spike was also observed particularly in high burning velocity mixtures. It is found that substantial amount of unburnt gases left inside the vessel after the vent burst is the leading factor in increase of Pmax for high burning velocity mixtures at centrally ignited. The associate gas velocities ahead of the flame create high unburnt gas flows conditions at entry to the vent and this give rise to high back pressures which lead to the severity in final Pmax inside the vessel. It was observed that end ignition leads to a higher explosion severity than central ignition in most cases, implying that central ignition is not a worst-case scenario in <b>gas</b> <b>vented</b> explosions as reported previously...|$|E

Coal gangue (including bulk gangue and specific lithologies, such as coal, kaolinite-rich material, sandstone, carbonate minerals, and sulfide mineralizations), fired coal gangue and condensate products from <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> were fully characterized with respect to mineralogy, chemistry and leaching potential. The mineral paragenesis of the fired coal gangue (cristobalite, mullite, hematite, trydimite, cordierite) showed that the combustion temperature could reach 1200  °C. This was also corroborated by laboratory calcination tests. During this combustion some elements such as C, Cl, F, S, N, As, Cd, Hg, Pb, Sn, Ge and Se are emitted into the atmosphere. However, condensation processes accounted for the partial trapping of gaseous emissions of As, S, N, Hg and Se. Thus, condensate mineralizations of elemental sulfur and ammonium salts enriched in Se, As and other trace elements are frequent in the <b>gas</b> <b>vents.</b> The leaching potential of trace elements in the fresh coal gangue was relatively low, but the leaching of weathered coal gangue and the <b>gas</b> <b>vents</b> condensates could give rise to environmental problems, as these materials produce acidic leachates and yield relatively high leachable levels {{of a number of}} elements. © 2008 Elsevier B.
