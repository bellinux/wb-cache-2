Though nitroglycerin {{is commonly used}} in ischemic heart disease, its effects on <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities is un-known. In this study we have evaluated the effects of nitroglycerin on <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities and on ejection fraction in 25 patients. Sixteen had coronary artery disease (> 70 % luminal narrowing). Six had no evidence {{of heart disease and}} three had congestive cardiomyopathies with normal coronary arteries. Left ventricular angiography was performed prior to and six minutes after administration of 0. 4 mg of sublingual nitroglycerin. Twelve of the 16 coronary artery disease patients had <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities, and in seven of these, segmental <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> improved after nitroglycerin. In five, <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> did not change. The initial heart rate, left ventricular systolic and end-diastolic pressure, and left ventricular end-diastolic volumes were not different for those whose <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> improved versus those whose did not. The increase in the former and fall in the latter three hemodynamic parameters were significant (P < 0. 01) and similar for the two groups. In those whose <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities improved after nitroglycerin, ejection fraction (mean ± SE) in-creased significantly (P < 0. 05), from 0. 47 ± 0. 025 to 0. 62 ± 0. 046. In those without improvement, the ejection fraction went from 0. 55 ± 0. 056 to 0. 58 ± 0. 051 (NS). Three patients with congestive car-diomyopathy showed no improvement in ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> or ejection fraction after nitroglycerin. Left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities and ejection fraction improved in some coronary artery disease patients following nitroglycerin.

Methods: Minimally invasive coronary artery bypass grafting was performed in 34 patients, during which transesophageal echocardiography was used. Thirteen patients had isolated disease of the left anterior descending artery. Regional ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was analyzed by color kinesis with the SONOS 2500 transesophageal echocardiograph (Hewlett-Packard Co, Andover, Mass). On-line assessment of regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was continued during the operation.

Forty-five patients referred for cardiac catheterization were studied by digital intravenous ventriculography (mask mode) and direct ventriculography in the 30 ° right anterior oblique position. Quantitative <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was analyzed by a radial shortening method applied to both studies. Lower limits of normal radial shortening were determined for each technique and {{used to determine the}} presence or absence of <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> disorders. The inter- and intraobserver variability of radial shortening measurements was ± 5. 3 and ± 8. 8 %, respectively, with maximal discrepancies of - 6 and + 7 % fractional shortening units. The overall agreement between the two techniques in <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> assessment was 87 % (274 of 315 radii). A subset of patients also underwent atrial pacing, and a second digital intravenous ventriculogram was obtained (5 normal subjects and 15 patients with coronary artery disease).

To assess this unexpected finding, results were analyzed in 85 patients with <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities at rest who underwent two view (45 ° left anterior oblique and anterior) exercise radionuclide ventriculography and exercise thallium- 201 myocardial perfusion imaging. <b>Wall</b> <b>motion</b> was scored with a 5 point system (from 3 [normal] to — 1 [dyskinesia]); normalization or increase of 2 or more points with exercise signified improvement. Forty-eight patients (56 %) had no change or further deterioration of <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> at peak exercise, 15 (18 %) showed both improvement of <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> and deterioration and 22 (26 %) showed only improvement of <b>wall</b> <b>motion.</b> <b>Wall</b> <b>motion</b> improvement during exercise was found ip 57 (20 %) of 279 segments with asynergy at rest. Of these 57 segments improving with exercise, 45 (79 %) showed mild and 12 (21 %) showed severe asynergy at rest. Only seven segments (12 %) were associated with pathologic Q waves. Thallium- 201 perfusion was normal in 44 segments (77 %) while only 6 segments (11 %) had reversible and only 7 (12 %) had nonreversible thallium- 201 defects. In conclusion: 1) <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> that is abnormal at rest can sometimes improve with exercise; 2) this phenomenon generally occurs in zones without a Q wave or nonreversible thallium- 201 defect. Hence, segments with abnormal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> at rest that show improvement with exercise appear to represent viable nonischemic segments...|$|R

Furthermore, we compared the measurements of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system to determine the most reliable technique. METHODS: First, interobserver and intraobserver variability of M-mode ultrasound scan measurements was determined at different pressure levels in a cow iliac artery placed in an in vitro circulation. M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system were compared in the same model. Second, in an animal experiment, an aneurysm and endoleak model with both patent and thrombosed endoleaks was created. Systemic and aneurysmal mean and pulse pressures were recorded synchronically with pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning and a wall track system. RESULTS: The intraobserver and interobserver variability values for M-mode ultrasound scan measurement in vitro were 0. 11 mm (SD = 0. 10 mm) and 0. 15 mm (SD = 0. 13 mm), respectively. In the animal study, a significant difference existed with respect to the level of pulse pressure within the aneurysmal sac between the group with pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> and the group without such motion (P <. 0001). The presence of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was not correlated with the level of aneurysmal mean pressure. The level of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning correlated well with the level determined by means of the wall track system (r = 0. 74; P =. 01). For the level of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning, a significant difference between patent and thrombosed endoleaks existed (P =. 04). For detecting endoleaks, the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> as determined by means of the wall track system were 52 % and 100 %, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> as determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning were 64 % and 67 %, respectively. For the detection of pulse pressure in the aneurysmal sac, the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> as determined by means of the wall track system were 76 % and 100 %, respectively, and the sensitivity and specificity of pulsatile <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> as determined by means of M-mode ultrasound scanning were 90 % and 71 %, respectively.

MethodsAmong the 137 consecutive patients with HCM, 13 patients (mean age 52 ± 13 years) who progressed to mild LV systolic dysfunction (LV ejection fraction (LVEF) of 35 – 50 %) were studied. By reviewing the echocardiograms of these patients, <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> score index (WMSI) was scored using 16 segments model. ResultsHCM patients with mild LV systolic dysfunction exhibited mild LV dilatation, mild left atrial dilatation, septal hypertrophy, and LV <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> impairment localized in the septal and apical regions (septal WMSI 1. 94 ± 0. 33 vs. total WMSI 1. 51 ± 0. 25 and posterior WMSI 1. 02 ± 0. 07; p< 0. 001). During follow-up, further deterioration of LV systolic function (LVEF< 35 %) was noted in five patients, who had less severe hypertrophy at the initial echocardiograms. These patients developed progressive LV cavity enlargement and more severe and extensive <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities, accompanied by septal akinesis and wall thinning, although posterolateral <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> impairment was relatively mild (posterior WMSI 1. 80 ± 0. 27 vs. septal WMSI 2. 95 ± 0. 11; p< 0. 001).

Four patients were excluded: two because atrial capture was not achieved and two because of chest discomfort induced during transesophageal atrial pacing. Of the remaining 81 patients, 56 had significant coronary artery disease (≥ 75 % stenosis {{of at least one}} major coronary vessel) and 25 had no significant coronary artery disease; 25 of the 56 patients with coronary artery disease had no <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities at rest.

Regional myocardial perfusion was quantitated as a percent of the region infarcted (range 0 to 100 %) using a previously validated method. <b>Wall</b> <b>motion</b> was graded on a four point scale as 1 = normal (n = 266 regions), 2 = hypokinesia (n = 64), 3 = akinesia (n = 70), 4 = dyskinesia (n = 13) or not evaluable (n = 2). Regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> correlated directly with the severity of the perfusion deficit (r = 0. 68, p < 0. 0001). Among normally contracting regions, the mean perfusion defect score was only 2 ± 4. Increasingly severe <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities were associated with larger perfusion defect scores (hypokinesia = 6 ± 5, akinesia = 11 ± 7 and dyskinesia = 18 ± 5, all p < 0. 01 versus normal).

Fifty-eight of 65 segments that showed regional akinesis or dyskinesis were transmurally infarcted. Twenty-five of 38 pathologically normal segments seen by two-dimensional echocardiography as akinetic or dyskinetic were adjacent to scar. Hypokinesis was non-specific (31 segments normal, 21 subendocardial infarction). Normal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> excluded transmural infarc-tion (0 of 46 segments), but in one patient was associated with subendocardial injury (nine/ 42 segments).

Although initial clinical studies found evidence of transient <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities after rotational coronary atherectomy, the prevalence and duration of these <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities are unknown. Methods. Using simultaneous echocardiography, we prospectively evaluated 22 patients undergoing rotational atherectomy and compared their <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities with those of 10 patients undergoing coronary angioplasty alone. The extent of <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormality was quantified and plotted against time to produce curves of abnormal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> development and recovery {{for the two groups}}. Results. The cumulative ischemic time was similar for the two groups ([mean ± SD] 10. 3 ± 6 min for rotational atherectomy vs. 9. 6 ± 4. 2 min for coronary angioplasty, p = 0. 73). The rate of return to baseline function was significantly lower in the rotational atherectomy group than in the coronary angioplasty group (rotational atherectomy rate constant 0. 069 ± 0. 079 /min vs. coronary angioplasty rate constant 1. 250 ± 0. 47 /min, p = 0. 0001). The mean time to recovery of baseline <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> in the rotational atherectomy group (153 min, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 6. 5 to 3, 600) was significantly longer than in the coronary angioplasty group (2. 6 min, 95 % CI 1. 3 to 5. 5, p = 0. 0001). Rotational atherectomy burr time was longer in the patients who developed myocardial infarction than in those without myocardial infarction (4. 7 ± 2. 4 vs. 3 ± 1. 4 min, p = 0. 045). Conclusions. Transient <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities are common after rotational coronary atherectomy and have a longer duration than those observed after coronary angioplasty. This disparity may be a consequence of differences in the mechanisms by which rotational coronary atherectomy and coronary angioplasty produce their effect...|$|R
40|$|To {{overcome}} the assumptions and approximations {{mandated by the}} use of traditional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> methodologies, a method was recently developed for measuring ventricular shape based on quantitative curvature analysis of ventricular outlines. This study was designed to assess prospectively the performance of this algorithm, to compare it to traditional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> measurements (centerline method), and to determine the comparative degree to which each method mimicked the interpretation of <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> by clinical observers. Semiquantitative visual grading of regional function in 52 patients was performed by four independent observers on two occasions. Anterior, apical, or inferior segments were judged to be normal (0 points) or abnormal (1 point) based on viewing nonrealigned, end-diastolic and end-systolic ventricular silhouettes from cineventriculograms obtained in the 30 -degree right anterior oblique projection. Each segment was assigned a collated score ranging from 0 (all observers felt the region was normal on both readings) to 8 (all observers felt the region was abnormal on both readings). Quantitative regional curvature analysis and <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> analysis (centerline method) were performed. Quantitative shape and <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> scores correlated equally well with the semiquantitative visual scores. When a visual score of >= 4 was used to designate an abnormal segment, both quantitative approaches demonstrated comparable sensitivity, specificity, and concordance rates. Both methods achieved optimal performance when maximum and minimum deviations from normal were recorded. Under these circumstances, the shape analysis demonstrated a greater concordance with the clinical diagnosis than did <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> analysis (99 % vs 93 %, p < 0. 04). Thus new information is provided by the shape analysis program that reflects clinical evaluations more closely and does not require assumptions mandated by traditional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> methods. This confirms the value of quantitative regional curvature analysis in a prospectively studied patient population with subtle <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities...|$|R

All echocardiographic examinations were performed by experienced echocardiographers blinded to the clinical information, PET image findings, and SPECT image findings. We used a commercially available ultrasound system (Sonos 5500, Philips Medical Systems, Andover, MA, USA) equipped with a broadband harmonic phased-array transducer (S 4 probe). LV <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was evaluated using the 16 -segment model based on the ASE recommendations [20]. LV <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was evaluated using a five-point scoring system according to the ASE guidelines: 1 normokinesis, 2 mild hypokinesis, 3 severe hypokinesis, 4 akinesis, and 5 dyskinesis [20]. Six months after the onset of ACS, we evaluated the regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> as a follow-up study (Fig.  1). A decrease of more than 1 in the LV <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> score at follow-up compared with the initial study was defined as regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> improvement [23].

40|$|To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} ischaemia in the genesis of new septal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities after coronary artery bypass surgery 45 patients were studied by cross sectional echocardiography before and 8 - 10 days after operation. Regional left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was classified as normal, hypokinetic, akinetic, or dyskinetic. Septal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities were correlated with electrocardiographic Q wave changes and serial serum MB creatine kinase measured before and 4, 7, 21, 48, and 72 hours after operation. Of the 14 patients who developed new septal <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities after operation two developed septal akinesis (both had perioperative infarction) and one new dyskinesis in the previously akinetic septal segment. Of the 11 patients with new septal hypokinesis, eight had normal serial creatine kinase MB values, two had raised values peaking four and seven hours after operation, with a return to normal values at 21 hours indicating transient ischaemia, and one had enzymatic criteria for perioperative infarction.

40|$|Abstract Background Noncompaction {{cardiomyopathy}} (NCCM) {{is characterized}} by a prominent trabecular meshwork and deep intertrabecular recesses. Although systolic dysfunction is common, limited information is available on differences in <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> of the normal compacted and noncompacted segments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to assess radial <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> and longitudinal <b>wall</b> velocity in patients with NCCM, according to the extent and severity of noncompaction. Methods The study comprised 29 patients in sinus rhythm (age 41 ± 15 years, 15 men), who fulfilled stringent diagnostic criteria for NCCM and compared to 29 age and gender matched healthy controls. Segmental radial <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> of all compacted and noncompacted segments was assessed with the standard visual <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> score index and longitudinal systolic (Sm) wall velocity with tissue Doppler imaging of the mitral annulus. For each LV wall a normalized Sm value was calculated. The extent and severity of NC in each LV segment was assessed both in a qualitative and quantitative manner.

40|$|Physiologically {{relevant}} {{simulations of}} blood flow require models {{that allow for}} wall deformation. Normally a fluid–structure interaction (FSI) approach is used; however, this method relies on several assumptions and patient-specific material parameters that are difficult or impossible to measure in vivo. In order to circumvent the assumptions inherent in FSI models, aortic <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was measured with MRI and prescribed directly in a numerical solver. In this way {{is not only the}} displacement of the vessel accounted for, but also the interaction with the beating heart and surrounding organs. In order to highlight the effect of <b>wall</b> <b>motion,</b> comparisons with standard rigid wall models was performed in a healthy human aorta. The additional computational cost associated with prescribing the <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was low (17 %). Standard hemodynamic parameters such as time-averaged wall shear stress and oscillatory shear index seemed largely unaffected by the <b>wall</b> <b>motion,</b> {{as a consequence of the}} smoothing effect inherent in time-averaging. Conversely, instantaneous wall shear stress was greatly affected by the wall motion; the wall dynamics seemed to produce a lower wall shear stress magnitude compared to a rigid wall model. In addition, it was found that if <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was taken into account the computed flow field agreed better with in vivo measurements. This article shows that it is feasible to include measured subject-specific <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> into numerical simulations, and that the <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> greatly affects the flow field. This approach to incorporate measured motion should be considered in future studies of arterial blood flow simulations...|$|R

Fourteen patients had undergone a two-stage and seven patients a primary repair. Twenty patients {{were found to have}} echocardiographic images adequate for <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> analysis. The results of these studies were correlated with thallium- 201 myocardial perfusion scans. Left ventricular <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> was assessed by measuring regional area change in parasternal and apical views. After planimetry of an end-systolic and an end-diastolic frame, the ventricle was divided into eight equal segments and the percent area change was calculated. Both a fixed reference and a floating system correcting for translation and rotation were applied. The measurements in the patient group were compared with normal age-matched values previously obtained in 55 normal infants and children. <b>Wall</b> <b>motion</b> abnormalities, found in seven patients, were located at the apex in three, at the inferior septum and anterolateral wall in one and the inferior, anterolateral and lateral walls in one patient each.

40|$|Although {{two-dimensional}} echocardiography {{is widely used}} in both clinical and experimental evaluations of regional cardiac <b>wall</b> <b>motion,</b> there is no established clinical method for quantitative analysis of the <b>wall</b> <b>motion,</b> not even for the normal radial motion observed in short-axis images. Measurement of radial <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> requires determination of a centroid from which the radii emanate. Depending on its definition, the centroid is variously affected throughout systole by cardiac translation, regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> and any shift of the subject position or transducer. A floating centroid is defined relative to the ventricular walls frame by frame, whereas a fixed centroid never moves {{with respect to the}} transducer. Evaluation of the best approach to definition of a centroid was previously presented (part I, this issue). The next question is how to use the centroid. This study examines which of four centroid applications provides the best reference for quantifying regional <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> during systole. Method 1 is a floating centroid (defined separately for every image frame), method 2 uses the end-diastolic centroid as a fixed reference for all image frames, method 3 uses the end-systolic centroid as a fixed reference and method 4 uses the average as a fixed refer- ence. <b>Wall</b> <b>motion</b> was measured with respect to each of these centroids by determining radial <b>wall</b> <b>motion</b> from end-diastole to end-systole and correlating radial motion throughout the cardiac cycle with that in normal control hearts. Results were analyzed with respect to interobserver variance, symmetry of contraction in normal hearts (closeness of agreement of excursions for 36 equiangular radiais in the short-axis view) and correlation of abnormal contraction with microsphere distribution and infarct staining.
