5|$|<b>From</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> end of Europe (the Iberian Peninsula) {{came the}} few people who formed during the 2500-1900 BCE period the Bell-Beaker culture. It was named after the shape of their typical, {{carefully}} finished and precisely ornamented pottery. Southwestern Poland was at the eastern edge of their range. Because of their mobility, the Bell-Beaker people helped spread new inventions, including developing metallurgy, over large areas of Europe.|$|E

5|$|The {{top four}} teams from these groups will {{advance to the}} {{knockout}} playoff stage. In the quarterfinals, the first place team from one group plays the fourth place team <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> group, and the second place team from one group plays the third place team <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> group. The winners advance to the semi-finals. In cases where the quarter-final venues are deemed too far apart to allow easy travel between them, the teams stay within their groups for the quarters. The winners of the quarter-finals advance to the semi-finals, with {{the winners of the}} semi-finals advancing to the Gold medal game and the losers advancing to the Bronze medal game.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} Maratha gunners who had feigned death when the British {{advanced}} over their position re-manned their guns {{and began to}} pour cannon fire into {{the rear of the}} 74th and Madras infantry. Wellesley ordered his four sepoy battalions to re-form and ward off any threat from the Maratha infantry and cavalry while the 78th were sent back to retake the Maratha gun line. Wellesley, meanwhile, galloped back to 7th Madras Native Cavalry, which had been held back in reserve to the east, and led a cavalry charge <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction. The gunners again stood their ground but were eventually driven from their guns and this time it was ensured that all those who remained were dead.|$|E
5|$|Following training, the {{battalion}} was deployed to New Guinea, arriving in Milne Bay in early August 1943. It saw {{action in the}} final stages of the Salamaua–Lae campaign in September 1943. The 2/15 took part in the landing at Lae, the first amphibious operation undertaken by Australian forces since the failed Gallipoli campaign in 1915. During the operation, the 2/15th was initially assigned the task of securing the beachhead following the 20th Brigade's landing. After being relieved it joined the advance west towards the town, slowed by heavy rains that turned the many creeks in the area into raging torrents, which were invariably covered by heavy Japanese fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> bank.|$|E

5|$|The weather {{continued}} to hamper the 9th Division's advance. The 26th Brigade, further inland, remained {{stuck on the}} eastern side of the Busu. On 10 September, the commandos providing flank security managed to get across the Sankwep River, close to its confluence with the Busu, pushing a kunda bridge across. Shortly afterwards, they clashed with a small party of Japanese attempting to advance towards the bridge, and several Japanese were killed. To reinvigorate the 26th, engineer support was brought up. The 2/7th Field Company was pushing a jeep track forward with the help of the 2/48th, and they subsequently arrived with boats, ropes and cables, and several attempts were made to get across, all of which eventually failed as the engineers came under fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> bank. Heavy clashes later took place as the Australians and Japanese fought desperately in the swamp around the crossing. As it became uncertain whether the 26th would be able to force their way across, a company from the 2/48th was sent south to use the 24th Brigade's crossing and then advance north along the western bank of the Busu to help secure the brigade's beachhead when it finally did get across. on 13 September further engineer stores arrived, including bridging equipment and folding boats, and the following day a Small Box Girder bridge was pushed across despite heavy fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> bank, allowing the 26th Brigade to get across the Busu on 14 September.|$|E
5|$|Throughout mid-1835, {{both governments}} {{continued}} their practice of one-upmanship, and constant skirmishes and arrests occurred. Citizens of Monroe County joined {{together in a}} posse to make arrests in Toledo. Partisans from Ohio, angered by the harassment, targeted the offenders with criminal prosecutions. Lawsuits were not only rampant, they served {{as a basis for}} retaliatory lawsuits <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> side. Partisans from both sides organized spying parties {{to keep track of the}} sheriffs of Wood County, Ohio and Monroe County, Michigan who were entrusted with the security of the border.|$|E
5|$|Although the LVII Panzer Corps was reluctantly {{released}} to Army Group Don, by Army Group A, the 17th Panzer Division was ordered {{back to its}} original area of concentration, and did not prepare {{to go back to}} Army Group Don until 10 days after it had been asked for. In light of the troubles in building up sufficient forces, and seeing that the Soviets were concentrating more mechanization on the Chir River, Manstein decided to launch Operation Winter Storm using the 4th Panzer Army. Manstein hoped that the 6th Army would launch an offensive of its own, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> side, upon the receipt of the code signal Thunderclap. Manstein was gambling on Hitler accepting that the only plausible method to avoid the demise of the 6th Army was allowing it to break out, and assumed that General Paulus would agree to order his forces to escape the Stalingrad pocket. On 10 December, Manstein communicated to Paulus that the relief operation would commence in 24 hours.|$|E

The other ship cut her anchor and attempted to flee, but the boats of Clarisse overhauled and captured her without resistance, most of her crew being ashore. Surcouf returned to Île de France with his prizes in June.|$|E
5|$|Once {{assembled}} at Nadzab, the 25th Infantry Brigade commenced its {{advance on}} Lae. On 11 September, it engaged the Japanese soldiers at Jensen's Plantation. After defeating them, it engaged and defeated a larger Japanese force at Heath's Plantation. During this skirmish, Private Richard Kelliher won the Victoria Cross, Australia's highest award for gallantry. The Japanese Army elected {{not to fight}} for Lae, preferring instead to withdraw over the Saruwaged Range. This {{proved to be a}} gruelling test of endurance for the Japanese soldiers who had to struggle over the rugged mountains; in the end, the Japanese Army managed to withdraw its forces from Salamaua and Lae, though with extensive losses from exposure and starving during the retreat. Troops of the 25th Infantry Brigade reached Lae shortly before those of the 9th Division that had been advancing on Lae <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction.|$|E
5|$|Once the Confederates {{had crossed}} the river, the Alice Dean was set ablaze and sunk in the river between Morvin's landing and Mauckport to deny the Union pursuers use of the vessel and to block the landing, making their {{crossing}} more difficult. Morgan ordered the McCombs to be burnt, but Col. Duke countermanded the order because of his friendship with its captain. He was allowed to return with his ship to Louisville unharmed. Gen. Hobson and {{the main body of}} the Union cavalry arrived in Brandenburg at about 10:15 pm, just as the Alice Dean went under the water. He set up his artillery and fired several shots at the Confederates who jeered at him <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> side of the river; they quickly withdrew out of range of his guns. The lead elements of the cavalry had already set out northward following the Legion forces who withdrew gradually and fought delaying skirmishes along the Mauckport road to slow the cavalry's advance towards Corydon.|$|E

5|$|Over {{the next}} couple of days volunteers arrived in Lyme {{offering}} to serve under Monmouth. By 15 June he had a force in excess of 1,000 men. On 13 June he lost two of his leading supporters when Dare and Fletcher disputed who should ride one of the best horses provided by local supporters. Fletcher shot and killed Dare and was then put under arrest and sent back to the frigate Helderenberg. The next day, 40 cavalry and 400foot soldiers, under the command of Lord Grey and Wade, moved on to the nearby town of Bridport, where they encountered 1,200 men from the local royalist Dorset militia. The skirmish ended with the retreat of Grey and the cavalry followed by Wade with the foot soldiers. Many of the militiamen deserted and joined Monmouth's army. Following this confrontation, Lord Albermarle led a royalist force from Exeter towards the forces of the Duke of Somerset, who were approaching Lyme Regis <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese {{assault on}} the 2/23rd {{subsequently}} delayed the 9th Division's advance for several days, and these would eventually prove significant as in that time, the rain set in, flooding the numerous waterways that forked inland from the coast. Covered with heavy fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> bank, they would prove difficult for the Australians to cross. As the advance continued, stores were pushed forward from Red Beach, and landed by LCVs and LCMs around Apo Fishing Village on 6/7 September, and then again on 7 September around the Singaua Plantation, from where both the 24th and 26th Infantry Brigades undertook a resupply before the advance continued. The going was slow, with the ground saturated, and the thick jungle and kunai grass along the route of advance delayed the troops who had to cut several tracks through the foliage. On the inland route, the 2/24th led the way towards the Burep River, while along the coast the 2/28th relieved the 2/32nd. As they reached the Burep, the two brigades separated, with the 26th advancing alongside the Burep for several miles before crossing it further inland and then driving towards the Busu.|$|E
5|$|The {{second day}} started {{dramatically}} when Halcombe bowled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> end and bowled the second over of the day, with Lonergan standing at square leg. His first ball was {{deemed to be}} legitimate but from then on there was a continuous call of no ball, for ten consecutive deliveries. Halcombe then substantially reduced his pace and completed the over after 18 balls. Although Bryant did not switch Halcombe {{to the other end}} in the first match, he did so on this occasion. Halcombe continued bowling and there were no further no ball calls. During the ten consecutive no balls, Lonergan had remained firm despite continuous heckling from a section of the crowd who showed their support of the bowler. Halcombe persevered and ended the innings with 3/61 from 20 overs. His action was much discussed, in particular his faster ball. The opening batsmen Rushforth and Atkinson played Halcombe in a diplomatic manner, making little effort to attack his bowling {{in the midst of the}} throwing calls.|$|E

5|$|He {{participated in}} the drive through France and was wounded in Aachen, Germany and was sent to England to recover. After he recovered, he rejoined the front lines reassigned to the 3rd Infantry Division and was given a {{battlefield}} commission to second lieutenant. By April 18, 1945, he was a first lieutenant in command of Company A, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, 7th Army. On that day, he led his company in their advance through Nuremberg, Germany, and single-handedly engaged German forces several times. As his unit passed a city square, a German machine gun opened fire, causing several casualties. Daly rushed the position and killed the three gunners. Advancing ahead of his men, he came across a German patrol preparing to use rocket launchers to ambush American tanks. He again attacked alone and, despite being outnumbered and outgunned, killed all six patrol members. When a machine gun opened fire at close range, {{he picked up a}} dead man's rifle and killed the two-man German crew. On April 19, he was shot through the head; a bullet entered at his ear and exited <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> cheek. He was sent to England and eventually the United States to recuperate. At about the same time, his father, who had been wounded in France, was also being evacuated to the United States.|$|E
5|$|Krause {{and colleagues}} {{identified}} two teeth, MACN Pv-RN 249 and 250, as anterior upper premolars. 249 bears two longitudinal rows of cusps. One row (row A; possibly the lingual one) includes four cusps, the other (row B) includes at least two, but is damaged. In row A, {{there are three}} ridges (at the front, middle, and back) extending {{from the tip of}} the base of each cusp. The second and third cusps are largest and most widely separated from each other. In row B, one cusp bears three ridges, of which one extends towards the other cusp in the row and the two others towards row A) and the other cusp is damaged. 250 is more fragmentary, but bears at least five cusps and may represent the same tooth position as 249, though it would come <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> side of the mouth. The microstructure of the enamel of this tooth has been studied. With a width of about 55μm near the tip of a cusp, the enamel is thin. The enamel prisms are straight, small, and rounded and there is little material between the prisms. Small, rounded prisms are also seen in Gondwanatherium, Sudamerica, and other gondwanatheres, but in few multituberculates. Even in those multituberculates that do have small prisms, the prism sheath is closed, but the sheath is incomplete in Gondwanatherium and possibly Ferugliotherium.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} has a contralateral organisation {{with each}} hemisphere {{of the brain}} interacting primarily with {{one half of the}} body: {{the left side of the}} brain interacts with the right side of the body, and vice versa. The developmental cause for this is uncertain. Motor connections from the brain to the spinal cord, and sensory connections from the spinal cord to the brain, both cross sides in the brainstem. Visual input follows a more complex rule: the optic nerves from the two eyes come together at a point called the optic chiasm, and half of the fibres from each nerve split off to join the other. The result is that connections from the left half of the retina, in both eyes, go to the left side of the brain, whereas connections from the right half of the retina go to the right side of the brain. Because each half of the retina receives light coming <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> half of the visual field, the functional consequence is that visual input from the left side of the world goes to the right side of the brain, and vice versa. Thus, the right side of the brain receives somatosensory input from the left side of the body, and visual input from the left side of the visual field.|$|E
