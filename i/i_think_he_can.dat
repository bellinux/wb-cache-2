500|$|Davis was {{recalled}} on August 25 after Andruw Jones {{went on the}} DL and Blalock struggled. On September 8, in {{the second}} game of a doubleheader, he had three hits and four RBI, including a three-run home run against José Veras in a 105 victory over the Cleveland Indians. When Davis returned to the majors, his numbers improved dramatically, as he hit [...]318 in September and October, with five home runs and 21 RBIs in the two-month span. In 113 games (391 at bats), Davis batted [...]238 with 93 hits, 15 doubles, 21 home runs, and 59 RBI. However, he ranked seventh in the AL with 150 strikeouts. He did do well defensively; Washington said, when Blalock replaced him at first following his demotion, [...] "We can't expect Hank Blalock to be Chris Davis , but Hank is a professional. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> play first base." ...|$|E
500|$|Tim Ashley {{wrote in}} The Guardian in 2009 that Khachaturian's {{popularity}} {{fell in the}} West, because of his image as one of Soviet music's [...] "". He argued, [...] "Such a view is simplistic, given {{that he had a}} major brush with the authorities in 1948. But it's also easy to see how he acquired his awkward reputation when you hear his Violin Concerto, dating from 1940. It's an immensely attractive work, full of his trademark Armenian folk flourishes, and the swaying, hypnotic Andante is notably beautiful. But the unforced optimism of the outer movements now seems unthinking when we realise it was composed at a time when Stalin was giving Prokofiev and Shostakovich hell." [...] In 2003 conductor Marin Alsop opined that Khachaturian is [...] "very underperformed" [...] and [...] "somewhat underrated". She commented further: [...] "His music, of course, has {{a little bit of the}} edginess of the 20th-century sound, the dissonances coming in. But at the same time it marries this beautiful neo-romanticism and lush orchestration and the over-the-top approach, so <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be quite relevant these days." ...|$|E
500|$|In May 1999, Nicolas Anelka stated {{his desire}} to leave Arsenal and cited the English media {{as a reason for}} wanting to leave the club as they caused him [...] "enormous {{problems}} on a personal level". Lazio was interested in signing the player, but the Italian club refused to pay Arsenal's asking price of £23million. After Real Madrid reopened negotiations with Arsenal and Anelka, a deal was finally reached on 1 August 1999 and the player signed for the club, the next day. Arsenal sought to strengthen the squad's attacking options first by signing Davor Šuker from Real Madrid; the player was prepared to take a pay cut to join the club. The club then signed Juventus forward Thierry Henry for a club record fee of £11million. Wenger, who served as the player's protégé at Monaco, believed his best position was as a goalscorer: [...] "He was the top scorer in the Under-17s for France when I first had him and I think that, as well as having the qualities of youth, pace and power, he is a good finisher. That is something he has not worked on enough {{in the last two years}} because he has played more wide, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> become a central striker again. That is what we will try to develop together." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It depends {{very much}} on yourself, Mr. Scarborough. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> come very often, but {{you can make the}} {{distances}} long or short. You should attend to no business." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'To have {{me in his}} service, Sir?' cried Kit, who {{had stopped}} short in his work and faced about on the ladder like some {{dexterous}} tumbler. 'Why, Sir, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be in earnest when he says that.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I mean as a {{sufferer}} from mental derangement. Don't be communicative, and confine {{yourself to}} reassuring generalities, {{if you come}} across him. His mind's morbidly fixed on punishing Prescott. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be convinced that the man is innocent." ...|$|R
2500|$|Matthews {{was kept}} on as Australia's spinner for the First Test against the West Indies at the Gabba in 1992–93. [...] "His {{performance}} {{over the past}} 12 months has been sensational", said Border. [...] "He cops a lot of flak because his strike rate is {{not as high as}} some bowlers' but he's a 100 per cent man. It does come down to him taking wickets but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do a job for us." ...|$|E
2500|$|Coyne {{was brought}} into the Australian squad for the World Cup 2010 qualifiers against Iraq and Qatar in June 2008. He {{impressed}} in training with Australia manager Pim Verbeek saying: [...] "Chris is a leader, a tough defender. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> play at a higher level, but we shall see. I think it’s better {{to play a little}} bit more organised in the backline, and then we can use a player like Chris." [...] He made his debut for Australia in the 0–1 defeat to Iraq in Dubai, impressing with the way he marshalled the defence, leading Verbeek to praise him again, saying, [...] "He's an experienced player, he knows what he's doing and he's made a good impression on us. He's a leader. He's a very good header, he's never in panic." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. I think there will be a future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do it." [...] Later in the 2014 season, Robinson made 1 List A appearance for Hampshire.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Alice; [...] "I am {{beginning}} to get anxious about Lawrence, and if Mr. Foster can tell us anything fresh, I ought to hear it. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> <b>I</b> believe <b>he</b> told us all he knew before." ...|$|R
5000|$|Lewis {{has got the}} {{ingredient}} that can hurt teams at this level, which is real pace. <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> get better and <b>I</b> still <b>think</b> <b>he</b> {{needs to be a}} little bit more selfish, but he's always a threat." [...] Vale boss Micky Adams speaking in November 2009.|$|R
6000|$|... "He {{can hardly}} have {{expected}} that. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> {{have been such}} a fool. He may have {{thought that there was}} a possible off chance, and that he would not lose even that for want of asking. Of course you won't notice it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I can set {{it pretty}} rank," [...] said Raymond, {{speaking}} to Madam Rachel at the window, [...] "and then, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> make it run smooth." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} doing a little figuring, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> count on at least thirty-one votes. But I am not so sure of the other eleven." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Our old {{chief is}} full of the right spirit. He is losing power with the young men, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> still guide them. I will hope so, and we will return {{as soon as we}} can." ...|$|E
6000|$|So Richard did all {{he could}} to dissuade Philip from returning; but at length, finding that he could produce no {{impression}} on his mind, he yielded, and gave a sort of surly consent to the arrangement. [...] "Let him go," [...] said he, [...] "if he will. Poor man! He is sick, he says, and <b>I</b> suppose <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> not live unless <b>he</b> <b>can</b> see Paris again." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Colonel Parsons {{must have}} had great {{difficulty}} in crossing, Zaki. He is hardly likely to have brought any boats across, from Kassala. I don't know whether he has any guns with him, but if <b>he</b> has, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> have crossed, even if they made rafts enough to carry them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have been}} a good deal surprised, sir," [...] {{observed}} Greenly, a little drily, though with great respect of manner, [...] "that you have not ordered the rear-admiral to make more sail. He is jogging along like a heavy wagon, and yet <b>I</b> hardly <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> mistake these five ships for Frenchmen!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, well, then," [...] said he, [...] "if you {{can wait}} ten or fifteen minutes, the gentleman who has had the book will be here, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> explain {{anything}} {{in the first part}} of the work." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can.</b> I {{know that}} men do. What did your hero Waverley {{do with his}} heart in that grand English novel which you gave me to read? I am not Flora Mac Ivor, but you may find a Rose Bradwardine." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Oh, I {{could not}} do that,' cried Honor, with a sudden revulsion. Love them as she might, Owen Sandbrook's {{children}} must not step into Humfrey Charlecote's place. 'And, besides,' she added, 'I want my little Owen to be a clergyman; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be what his father missed.' ...|$|E
5000|$|Django {{is still}} one of my main influences, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> for lyricism. <b>He</b> <b>can</b> make me cry when I hear him. Toots Thielemans ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Exactly; {{taking it}} all {{together}} it's such a pity, you know. <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> Mr. Harding, <b>he</b> <b>can</b> hardly have intended to steal the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Because {{they have}} not the chance. All the world would love you, if it knew you. But, seriously, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>he</b> <b>can</b> hardly object, or {{he would not have}} allowed us to be thrown so much together; for, in nine cases out of ten, that sort of thing has only one result." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{have not}} as yet {{received}} any letter from Henri, nor do <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> have written to New York by your mail. I believe that I am--I know that I was--one of the executors. In that case Mr. Jackson, his agent, will either {{write to me}} very shortly on Henri's information of my address, or enquiry will be made at Gad's or at the office about it.|$|E
60|$|But let the man's case {{be what it}} will, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> {{never call}} it a hard shift to let his wife into an {{acquaintance}} with his business, if she desires it, and is fit for it; and especially in case of mortality, that {{she may not be}} left helpless and friendless with her children when her husband is gone, and when, perhaps, her circumstances may require it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Good!" [...] {{cried the}} Captain. [...] "I will {{join in the}} search, and take you in my ship. Some of my crew told me that {{yesterday}} they saw a young man, who looked like a prince, riding along the shore of a lake which adjoins the one we are on. In the morning we will sail after him. We shall keep near the shore, and your servant can mount your horse and ride {{along the edge of}} the lake. From what I know of the speed of this vessel, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> easily keep up with us." ...|$|E
6000|$|The poor {{schoolmaster}} {{appeared to}} be gratified by her earnest manner, but yet rendered more uneasy by it, for he added hastily that anxious people often magnified an evil and thought it greater than it was; 'for my part,' he said, in his quiet, patient way, 'I hope it's not so. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be worse.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was busy}} {{when he came}} along and I told him to look around for himself. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> took some <b>canned</b> stuff and {{there was quite a}} big loaf missing." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And I believe I {{had better}} not be there with Richard," [...] added Norman. [...] "I don't like coming into {{contrast}} with him, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> like it, poor fellow, and it isn't his fault. I had rather stay another year here, {{get one of the}} open scholarships, and leave the Stoneborough ones for those who can do no better." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That was the sagacity of {{your horse}} {{more than your}} own, I expect," [...] Ralph said. [...] "A horse can find his way along a path he has once {{traveled}} better than any man can do. In the first place, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> see better in the night; and in the second, he has some sort of instinct to guide him. However, I don't suppose it much matters; we shall find the path easily enough in the morning. And, as you said, the mist will hide our movements quite as effectually as the darkness would do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We cannot pry into hidden things,' Percy answered. 'Watch his wife, and {{you will}} see that she is satisfied. You may trust him to her, and to Him in whose hands he is. Of this I am sure, that there is a patient {{consideration}} for others, and readiness to make sacrifices that are not like what he used to be. You are not satisfied? It is not as you would repent; but you must remember that Arthur's is after all a boy's character; he has felt his errors as acutely as <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> feel them, and if he is turning from them, that is all we can justly expect. They were more weakness than wilfulness.' ...|$|E
60|$|I found Sir Redvers Buller and his Staff in a {{somewhat}} exposed position, whence an excellent view could be obtained. The General displayed his customary composure, asked me how my brother's wound was getting on, {{and told me that}} he had just ordered Hart's Brigade, supported by two battalions from Lyttelton's Division, to assault the hill marked '3' on my diagram, and hereinafter called Inniskilling Hill. 'I have told Hart to follow the railway. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>can</b> get round to their left flank under cover of the river bank,' he said, 'but we must be prepared for a counter-attack on our left as soon as they see what I'm up to;' and he then made certain dispositions of his cavalry, which brought the South African Light Horse close up to the wooded kopje on which we stood. I must now describe the main Pieters position, one hill of which was about to be attacked.|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{are going}} to take him back to Brill in a large sleigh," [...] said Dr. Wallington, [...] "and then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> the best <b>he</b> <b>can</b> do will be to go to bed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Somebody thoon will. At least, if he's on the level, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> is. You <b>can</b> {{generally}} tell by {{the look}} of a guy, and, if you ask me, friend Pilkington's got the licence in hith pocket and the ring all ordered and everything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Of {{course he}} {{is a great}} deal more clever than I am. I know that. But <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> even <b>he</b> <b>can</b> be so clever as he looks. 'Or you so stupid,' that's what you ought to say now." ...|$|R
