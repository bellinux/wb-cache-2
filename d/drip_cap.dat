50|$|The Division No. 9 School {{is located}} {{on the south side of}} Maine State Route 9 in rural southwestern Wells, east of its {{junction}} with Bragdon Road. It is set on a small grassy lot surrounded by forest. It is a single-story wood frame structure with a front-facing gable roof, clapboard siding, and a granite foundation. The front facade has a pair of matching entrances flanking a doubled sash window at the center, with a slightly smaller similar window pair in the gable above. The doors are topped by transom windows, and both doors and windows have <b>drip</b> molding <b>caps.</b> The west facade has two groups of three sash windows flanking a single sash window, and the east facade has two sash windows. The south side of the building has a shed-roof ell, which contains the building's bathrooms and a woodshed. The interior of the building is well preserved, with tongue-and-groove wainscoting in both the entrance vestibules and the classroom.|$|R
6000|$|With the {{circular}} in her hand, Honora went thoughtfully {{up the stairs}} to her sitting-room. The month was February, the day overcast and muggy, and she stood for a while apparently watching the holes made in the snow by the steady <b>drip</b> from the <b>cap</b> of the garden wall. What she really saw was the face of Mrs. Israel Simpson, a face that had haunted her these many months. For Mrs. Simpson had gradually grown, in Honora's mind, to typify the hardness of heart of Grenoble. With Grenoble obdurate, what would become of the larger ambitions of Hugh Chiltern? ...|$|R
60|$|I had {{intended}} to return {{in a day or}} two, but it pleased Fate to hold me from that side of the county, on many pretexts, till the elder and the wild rose had fruited. There came at last a brilliant day, swept clear from the south-west, that brought the hills within hand's reach--a day of unstable airs and high filmy clouds. Through no merit of my own I was free, and set the car for the third time on that known road. As I reached the crest of the Downs I felt the soft air change, saw it glaze under the sun; and, looking down at the sea, in that instant beheld the blue of the Channel turn through polished silver and dulled steel to dingy pewter. A laden collier hugging the coast steered outward for deeper water and, across copper-coloured haze, I saw sails rise one by one on the anchored fishing-fleet. In a deep dene behind me an eddy of sudden wind drummed through sheltered oaks, and spun aloft the first day sample of autumn leaves. When I reached the beach road the sea-fog fumed over the brickfields, and the tide was telling all the groins of the gale beyond Ushant. In less than an hour summer England vanished in chill grey. We were again the shut island of the North, all the ships of the world bellowing at our perilous gates; and between their outcries ran the piping of bewildered gulls. My <b>cap</b> <b>dripped</b> moisture, the folds of the rug held it in pools or sluiced it away in runnels, and the salt-rime stuck to my lips.|$|R
