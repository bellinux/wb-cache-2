50|$|This {{traditional}} form {{of farming}} {{has produced a}} High Nature Value landscape and in 2008 the European Union declared 250,000 ha of the Carpathian valleys as the Tarnava Mare Natura 2000 site with the whole area receiving protection as a Site of Community Importance (SCI) under the Birds Directive and 85,000 ha as a Special Conservation Area (SCA) under the Habitats Directive. The objective of these designations {{is to protect the}} traditional uses of the landscape that have produced this species-rich mosaic of habitats and species. The valleys contain the last lowland population of European Brown Bears (closely related to the American grizzly and more than 4000 animals remaining) as well as Wolves and threatened bird species, such as the Lesser Spotted Eagle, Corncrake and Woodlark, whilst the mainly oak and hornbeam forest areas contain 9 species of woodpecker as well as the spectacular Ural Owl. The upland hay meadows, which have not been fertilised for centuries, contain a very diverse grassland flora and associated butterfly species whilst the wet grass areas contain Great Burnet, the host plant for the Scarce Large Blue and <b>Dusky</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> butterflies.|$|E
40|$|Land-use {{change that}} took place in the second half of the 20 th century {{affected}} population sizes and viabilities of many species adapted to extensive land use. <b>Dusky</b> and Scarce <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are ones of these species. Both number of their populations and population sizes declined all over Europe. During the last decade, many protected areas of the Natura 2000 network have been established to preserve these butterfly species. Protected areas are managed specifically to support viability of the Maculinea populations. This thesis investigates a current status set of the Natura 2000 sites in southwest Bohemia protecting one or both Maculinea butterfly species. Implementation of the specific management was found to be a crucial factor for successful protection of the <b>Dusky</b> and Scarce <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies. We found that there are significant differences in managements applied in different locations. Almost half of protected areas are managed in inappropriate ways, their butterfly population sizes were very small or already extinct. Other sites are managed well and stable Maculinea populations live there. An assumption that a specific Maculinea management could also support another rare or endangered species has been tested in this thesis too.

40|$|Isolated {{populations of}} the {{myrmecophilous}} <b>Dusky</b> <b>Large</b> <b>Blue</b> butterfly (Maculinea nausithous) occur in Transylvania (Romania). The hitherto unknown host ant specificity of these populations was investigated at two sites, where Myrmica scabrinodis was the only potential host ant found. A total of 107 M. scabrinodis nests were opened in early summer to check {{for the presence of}} M. nausithous larvae, and two of them contained overwintered larvae. Our observations suggest that, like the habitat, the host ant of these isolated populations essentially differs from other central European M. nausithous populations studied, which use exclusively Myrmica rubra...|$|E
40|$|The {{ability of}} adult {{butterflies}} {{of the genus}} Maculinea to locate their host ants prior to oviposition {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. We studied the egg laying behavior of the <b>dusky</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> Maculinea nausithous whose larvae parasitize colonies of the ant Myrmica rubra. Flowerheads of the initial food plant were sprinkled with soil from ant nests, which contain chemicals involved in the nest recognition behavior of ants. The experiment was conducted to determine whether ant-released chemicals may act as oviposition cues and whether intraspecific competition for suitable plants may force female butterflies to alternative decisions. Host plant choice was not influenced by the presence of nest-derived host-ant cues. Density dependent shifts to less suitable host plants could not be ascertained nor changes in egg laying behavior across the flight period. The observed egg distribution could be primarily explained by host plant characteristics and environmental variability among sites. The result confirms the theory that host ant dependent oviposition appears to be a disadvantageous strategy in the face of resource limitation within ant colonies and the immobility of caterpillars...|$|E
50|$|Recent {{findings}} have {{also shown that}} there is a positive correlation between <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly conservation success and that of other endangered species. One specific example is the relationship between Myrmica ants, the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly, violet seeds, and the violet-feeding butterfly (Boloria euphrosyne). The ants will bring the violet seeds into the nest. The seeds will often germinate in the nest, and their potential for germination increases as the nest becomes deserted. Since <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterfly predation of ant larvae can lead to desertion of the nest and B. euphrosyne tend to prefer violets growing on deserted ant nests, the fitness of B. euphrosyne appears to be indirectly affected by the presence of the <b>large</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|R

40|$|Most of the European {{grassland}} butterfly {{species are}} dependent on species rich grasslands shaped by low intensity farming. Conservation of these specialist species in agricultural landscapes relies on knowledge of their essential resources and the spatial distribution of these resources. In The Netherlands, the <b>dusky</b> <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> Phengaris (Maculinea) nausithous butterflies were extinct until their reintroduction in 1990. In addition, a spontaneous recolonization of road verges in an agricultural landscape occurred in 2001 {{in the southern part}} of The Netherlands. We analyzed the use of the essential resources, both host plants and host ants, of the latter population during the summers of 2003 and 2005. First we tested whether the distribution of the butterflies during several years could be explained by both the presence of host plants as well as host ants, as we expected that the resource that limits the distribution of this species can differ between locations and over time. We found that oviposition site selection was related to the most abundant resource. While in 2003, site selection was best explained by the presence of the host ant Myrmica scabrinodis, in 2005 it was more strongly related to flowerhead availability of the host plant. We secondly compared the net displacement of individuals between the road verge population and the reintroduced population in the Moerputten meadows, since we expected that movement of individuals depends on the structure of their habitat. On the road verges, butterflies moved significantly shorter distances than on meadows, which limits the butterflies in finding their essential resources. Finally we analyzed the availability of the two essential resources in the surroundings of the road verge population. Given the short net displacement distances and the adverse landscape features for long-distance dispersal, this landscape analysis suggests that the Phengaris population at the Posterholt site is trapped on the recently recolonized road verges. These results highlight the importance of assessing the availability of essential resources across different years and locations relative to the movement of the butterflies, and the necessity to careful manage these resources for the conservation of specialist species in agricultural landscapes, such as this butterfly specie...|$|E

50|$|Laboratory {{studies have}} shown that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterflies}} predate the largest of the ant larvae first. This evolved tactic maximizes efficiency not only because the largest larvae provide the most substance by volume, but also because it prevents the larvae pupating and becoming inaccessible prey. Furthermore, it allows more newly hatched larvae time to grow bigger. While in the nest, <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> caterpillars acquire 99% of their final biomass, growing from an average of 1.3 mg to 173 mg. Results from laboratories estimate that 230 large larvae and a minimum of 354 Myrmica workers are needed to ensure the survival of one butterfly, however such a large nest is very rarely found in the wild. This supports findings that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are extremely capable of withstanding starvation. This becomes extremely beneficial in situations when the ants desert the colony and leave the caterpillar behind. <b>Large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies have been known to be capable of migrating to new nests once the original is deserted. In many cases, a nearby colony with a fresh brood will populate the nest allowing the surviving <b>large</b> <b>blues</b> to parasitize multiple Myrmica colonies.|$|R
50|$|Unlike {{other members}} of the Phengaris genus, the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> {{butterfly}} becomes a predator once it is in the ant nest. It feeds on the ant pupae while continuing to act as member of the Myrmica species. Even if they execute mimicry, mortality rates for the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> within the nest are high. One explanation is that each species of Phengaris is most suited for a specific species of Myrmica. Caterpillars that are adopted by an unfamiliar species of ant are often killed and eaten. Even if they are matched with the correct host, many <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> butterflies are unable to survive. If the mimicry is not perfect and the ants become suspicious, death is highly likely. Also ants in nests without a consistent supply of food {{are much more likely to}} identify the <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> as an intruder. It has been found that <b>large</b> <b>blue</b> caterpillars are most likely to be attacked during the first 10 days after being adopted by the host ants. This is due to the fact that in this time the caterpillars become larger than the size range of the Myrmica ant larvae.|$|R
