5|$|Typhoon Vera, {{also known}} as the , was an {{exceptionally}} intense tropical cyclone that struck Japan in September1959, becoming the strongest and deadliest typhoon on record to make landfall on the country. The storm's intensity resulted in damage of unparalleled severity and extent, and was a major setback to the <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy,</b> which was still recovering from World War II. In the aftermath of Vera, Japan's disaster management and relief systems were significantly reformed, and the typhoon's effects would set a benchmark for future storms striking the country.|$|E

5|$|During 1941 and {{the first}} months of 1942 Japan conquered or {{established}} de facto rule over almost the entire South China Sea region. Control of the sea was vital to the <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy,</b> as it was the conduit through which essential supplies of oil and other natural resources passed from occupied Malaya, Borneo and the Dutch East Indies. As the war turned against Japan, convoys of ships passing through the South China Sea frequently came under attack from Allied submarines and – by late 1944 – aircraft. These attacks were guided by information gained from signals intelligence and long-range air patrols, supplemented by reports from coast watchers along the Chinese coast and other observers in Asian ports. While losses of oil tankers and freighters were increasingly heavy, the Japanese Government continued to order ships to make the voyage. In an attempt to limit losses, convoys and individual ships took routes well way from the established sea lanes, or sailed close to the shore and operated only at night.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{forecast}} the influences of information and communication technology (ICT) on the structural changes of <b>Japanese</b> <b>economies.</b> In this study, input-output (IO) and statistical approaches are used as analysis instruments. More specifically, this study employs Leontief IO coefficients and constrained multivariate regression (CMR) model in order to achieve the purpose. The periods of initial and forecast in this study are 2005 and 2015, respectively. In this study, ICT is represented by ICT capital stocks. This study conducts two levels of analysis, namely macro and micro. The results of macro level analysis show that the dynamics of <b>Japanese</b> <b>economies</b> on the forecast period, relative to the initial period, are not so high. We focus on (1) commerce, (2) business services and office supplies, and (3) personal services sectors when conducting the analysis of the micro level. Further, we analyze its specific IO coefficients when doing this analysis. The results of the analysis explain that ICT gives a strong influence on the changes of these coefficients from initial to forecast periods.

5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} Floor Area Ratio limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest buildingthe 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyothe Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36stories and 156metres (512ft) in height. A booming post-war <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy</b> and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese asset price bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E
5|$|Japan {{is one of}} the top-performing OECD {{countries}} in reading literacy, maths and sciences with the average student scoring 540 and has one of the worlds highest-educated labor forces among OECD countries. The Japanese populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's competitive high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan's post-war economic growth. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy. Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small. In 2015, Japan's public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the OECD average of 4.7%. In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea. As the <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy</b> is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other higher education institution.|$|E

Both countries grew rapidly in comparative perspective since World War II; Japan recorded greater cyclical fluctuations than Italy; despite this, however, it enjoyed full employment and high labour force participation throughout, while Italy suffered from more joblessness and lower activity rates. Corporate governance institutions, similar before the war, differ quite markedly today; public sector intervention in the economy has been widespread in both countries; Japan's appears to have been more efficient than Italy's. ...|$|R
25|$|The deficit {{spending}} had a transformative effect on Japan. Japan's industrial production doubled during the 1930s. Further, in 1929 {{the list of}} the largest firms in Japan was dominated by light industries, especially textile companies (many of Japan's automakers, such as Toyota, have their roots in the textile industry). By 1940 light industry had been displaced by heavy industry as the largest firms inside the <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy.</b>|$|E
25|$|In addition, as the <b>Japanese</b> <b>economy</b> grew {{quickly in}} the 1980s, a sizable number of Westerners began coming to Japan.

Although some have become permanent residents or even naturalized citizens, they are generally perceived as short-term visitors and treated as outsiders of Japanese society.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{circumstances}} beyond Japan's {{direct control}} contributed to its success.

The Russo-Japanese War (1904–05), World War I (1914–18), the Korean War (1950–53), and the Second Indochina War (1954–75) brought economic booms to Japan. In addition, benign treatment from the United States after World War II facilitated the nation's reconstruction and growth.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} inflation {{dynamics in}} the USA and Japan from 1980 Q 1 to 2013 Q 2. Changes in inflation, unemployment, output gap and policy interest rate behaviours {{during the last}} Great Recession that hit the US and <b>Japanese</b> <b>economies</b> are considered. According to a vector autoregression and VEC analyses, we found that {{even if there is}} evidence that inflation and unemployment are I (1), there is not a long-run inflation–unemployment tradeoff for the USA. Surprisingly, a short-run inflation–unemployment trade-off is very weak in Japan. This study is consistent with the opinion that the relationship between these two variables is not stable in either the short run nor in the long run: unemployment shows Granger causality with inflation but the opposite is not true in the USA. There is no Granger causality for Japan. We also find evidence that monetary policy lost its power in the US and <b>Japanese</b> real <b>economies</b> after the 2008 crisis...|$|R
