50|$|There is {{sometimes}} confusion {{about how much}} theoretical mechanical advantage {{is provided by the}} trucker's hitch. If the trucker's hitch were to be used as in the pulley diagram at right, to lift a weight off the floor, the theoretical mechanical advantage would be only 2:1. However in the common use of the trucker's hitch, a static <b>hook,</b> <b>ring,</b> or rail, serves as the lower pulley, and the rope {{across the top of the}} load is the portion being tensioned. Thus, the standing part of the rope is represented by the top anchor point in the diagram, and the theoretical ratio is indeed 3:1 when the working end is tensioned. That is, in a frictionless system, every unit of force exerted on the working end would produce 3 units in the standing part of the rope over the load. In the typical use of the trucker's hitch, where it is used to tighten a rope over a load, when the end is secured to the loop of the Truckers hitch and let go, the tension in the two segments of rope around the ring will rise 50%, unless the rope slackens when it is being tied off, in which case the tension may drop to any value or even zero if enough slack is allowed. But when the trucker's hitch is used as in the diagram, after tying off, the load on the attachment point above the top pulley will drop to 400 lb and the tension in the two lines going to the lower pulley will not change.|$|E

40|$|Automation {{becomes more}} {{significant}} on increasing effectiveness and efficiency. Therefore, to provide better facilities, hotels take {{a turn for}} automation. For that reason, an automation system on giving service by hotels for receiving and sending a certain message in a certain moment to the guest, has been designed. The guest {{will be in charge}} with the Interactive Voice Response system through the telephone line to receive messages. The recorded voice messages will guide the guest to enter necessary data to form the message such as room number, date, time and kind of message. The automation system is designed in Delphi 3. 0 using Sound Card. The guidance voice is pre-recorded messages. The services provided are Wake Up Call and Personal Reminder. The hardware involved in the system are on/off <b>hook,</b> <b>ring</b> detector, tone detector and DTMF decoder, while the software are DTMF encoder and the controller system. The conclusion shows that system enables computer functions as the receiver and message deliverer automatically without operator interference. Unfortunately, the telephone voice recording has a noise that is caused by the sidetone effect of the line. Furthermore, this interactive voice system can be equipped with voice recognition and speech synthesizer instead of using stored speech, as done in this final project...|$|E

50|$|Leather sleepsacks are {{probably}} the most durable type of sleepsack. They often come with bondage <b>hooks</b> or <b>rings</b> along the sides, at the shoulders, and at the feet for attaching restraints, tie-downs, or rope, to further secure the sack and occupant to a bed, bondage frame, or table. Leather sleepsacks can also be suspended upright or horizontal with the appropriate knowledge and equipment.|$|R
50|$|Pétardiers were {{deployed}} during sieges of castles or fortified cities. The pétard, a rather primitive and exceedingly dangerous explosive device, comprised a brass or iron bell-shaped device filled with gunpowder and affixed to a wooden base called a madrier. This {{was attached to}} a wall or gate using <b>hooks</b> and <b>rings,</b> the fuse lit and, if successful, the resulting explosive force, concentrated at the target point, would blow {{a hole in the}} obstruction, allowing assault troops to enter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>hook</b> and <b>ring</b> {{game was}} adopted by the earlier {{settlers}} of the Caribbean islands, where it is also referred to as the Bimini Ring Game. When the hook is attached to a post or pole, the ring can actually be swung behind the hook, catching on the hook as it swings back. If the ring is caught by the hook, the score is two points. If the ring is first swung from behind the hook and it swings back and catches on the hook, the score for the throw is three points.|$|R

40|$|A {{procedure}} is described for the purification of the Escherichia coli outer membrane (lipopolysaccharide or L membrane) with flagella still attached. The resulting lipopolysaccharide membrane {{was in the}} form of vesicles that had a trilaminar structure in thin section and contained about 55 % lipopolysaccharide and 45 % protein. T 2 or T 4 phage preadsorbed to E. coli were found attached to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane. Flagella were bound to the purified lipopolysaccharide membrane specifically at the basal body ring closest to the <b>hook</b> (the L <b>ring).</b> The cytoplasmic membrane in preparations from osmotically lysed E. coli spheroplasts or Bacillus subtilis protoplasts was specifically attached to flagella at the basal body ring farthest from the <b>hook</b> (the M <b>ring).</b> In the E. coli preparation, lipopolysaccharide membrane was also present and was attached to the L ring. From these data and a knowledge of the structure and dimensions of the E. coli flagellar basal body and cell envelope, a model for flagellar attachment is deduced...|$|R
50|$|The bowls {{are usually}} of thin beaten bronze, between 15-30 cm (6-12 inches) in diameter, and dished or cauldron-shaped in profile.

The ornament of these plates is often very sophisticated, {{and in many cases}} includes beautiful coloured enamel work, commonly in champlevé and using spiral motifs. Although their designs and manufacture are thought to proceed from Celtic technique, they are principally found in eastern Britain, and especially in the areas which received Anglo-Saxon acculturation. Their production is also evidenced in Pictish and Irish contexts, but they seem almost completely absent from Wales, Devon and Cornwall.|$|R

However, Jack is able to escape and finds himself facing off against Dark Cloud and Night Stalker as well. When Sawyer attempts to get the upper hand, Sawyer and Jack are thrown through boxes. As Dark Cloud and Night Stalker look to see what happened, Jack gets up {{and is able to}} take out both Night Stalker and Dark Cloud. When Angel, who is also there, confronts Jack, she wises up and helps him free Sally and his mother. As the trio are about to leave, Sawyer returns and does a triple jump kick, knocking Sally and Mrs. Cody out. As Sawyer goes for his throat kick to Jack, Angel deflects and fights Sawyer, only to get the death kick herself. Jack finally arises and goes one-on-one with Sawyer. Sawyer proves to be too much for Jack with his intense kicking skills and <b>hook</b> <b>rings.</b> However, when Sally turns off the lights and yells for Jack to concentrate, Jack realizes he must use Tai Chi. As Sawyer goes back on the attack, Jack begins to use Tai Chi and deflects and eventually knocks down Sawyer. Jack soon gets the upper hands and ends it with a drop kick to Sawyer, sending him to the cage, where he is impaled on a wooden block with barbed wire. Angel gives her last words to Jack as she dies. The police arrive as does Grandfather and a somewhat recuperated Budokai. Grandfather tells Jack that he is truly a hero.|$|R
50|$|Bigbury Camp {{has been}} the focus of a {{significant}} amount of archaeological study. Digging at Bigbury has unearthed a number of iron artefacts including agricultural tools and kitchen untensils. In 1861, gravel diggers unearthed a quantity of corroded ironwork consisting of the remains of rods, <b>rings</b> and <b>hooks</b> together with triangular bricks arranged in a circle that displayed evidence of burning. At the time this was interpreted as a Roman-style hearth that had consisted of three iron legs supporting <b>hooks</b> and <b>rings</b> from which would have been suspended a cauldron. The total height of the apparatus would have been approximately 5 ft. A flint arrowhead was found nearby. The gravel diggers also found a large iron knife measuring 10.5 in, including the tang. Parts of a horses bridle were also recovered, including a snaffle bit with 3.25 in wide bridle rings.|$|R

50|$|A torc, also spelled torq or torque, {{is a large}} rigid or stiff {{neck ring}} in metal, made either as a single piece or from strands twisted together. The great {{majority}} are open at the front, although some had <b>hook</b> and <b>ring</b> closures and a few had mortice and tenon locking catches to close them. Many seem designed for near-permanent wear {{and would have been}} difficult to remove. Torcs are found in the Scythian, Illyrian Thracian, Celtic, and other cultures of the European Iron Age from around the 8th century BC to the 3rd century AD. For the Iron Age Celts the gold torc {{seems to have been a}} key object, identifying the wearer as a person of high rank, and many of the finest works of ancient Celtic art are torcs. The Celtic torc disappears in the Migration Period, but during the Viking Age torc-style metal necklaces, now mainly in silver, came back into fashion. Torc styles of neck-ring are found as part of the jewellery styles of various other cultures and periods.|$|R
50|$|The boost {{engines are}} held {{together}} as a single assembly by a metal ring {{at the rear of}} the missile. Each motor has a small <b>hook</b> on the <b>ring</b> as well as similar one at the front holding it to the missile body. After firing, when the thrust of the rockets falls below the thrust of the now-lit ramjets, the boosters slide rearward until the front hook disengages from the missile body. The boosters are then free to rotate around their attachment to the metal ring, and are designed to rotate outward, away from the fuselage. In action, they fold open like the petals on a flower, greatly increasing drag and pulling the entire four-booster assembly away from the missile body.|$|R
60|$|With {{trembling}} hands I lit a match. I {{had only three}} left, and we saw {{that we were in}} the angle of {{the far corner of the}} chamber, a fact that accounted for our not having noticed the hollow sound of the place during our former exhaustive examination. As the match burnt we scrutinised the spot. There was a join in the solid rock floor, and, great heavens! there, let in level with the rock, was a stone ring. We said no word, we were too excited, and our hearts beat too wildly with hope to allow us to speak. Good had a knife, at the back of which was one of those hooks that are made to extract stones from horses' hoofs. He opened it, and scratched round the ring with it. Finally he worked it under, and levered away gently for fear of breaking the <b>hook.</b> The <b>ring</b> began to move. Being of stone it had not rusted fast in all the centuries it had lain there, as would have been the case had it been of iron. Presently it was upright. Then he thrust his hands into it and tugged with all his force, but nothing budged.|$|R
40|$|Percutaneous skin access devices {{include a}} {{plurality}} of locked connecting units mounted to the exterior surface of an implantable medical object which, in position, is configured to penetrate {{the skin of a}} subject. The locked connecting units may be mounted directly onto the desired surface of the exterior of the device or may be held on a substrate sheet, which is mounted to the exterior surface of the device. In position, the locked connecting units engage with soft tissue which can include the skin to form a bio-junction layer which includes mechanical and bio-sealing connection between the device body and the soft tissue. The configuration at the bio-junction layer secures the medical object in location in the subject even for long-term indwelling applications in a manner, which inhibits soft tissue infection. The locked connecting units may be rigid or semi-rigid for longer-term indwelling applications, and semi-rigid and/or resilient for shorter term indwelling applications. The locked connecting units may take on the form of <b>rings,</b> <b>hooks,</b> or loops having aperture or gap width/length sizes of from about 0. 2 4 mm. The <b>rings,</b> loops, or <b>hooks</b> may connect with any soft tissue including skin as well subcutaneous tissue.

The locked connecting units may be configured as a semi-rigid mesh collar arranged about the primary body providing access to the subject such that it resides in the subject and engages with the skin (epidermal/dermal layer). The mesh collar can be described as a particular type of ring or loop structure as the mesh defines the gap provided in individual loop configurations. The mesh collar may be used alone, or in combination with the loops, <b>rings,</b> or <b>hooks.</b> A skin stop collar having increased rigidity may be disposed under the mesh collar...|$|R

40|$|The flagellar regulon of Brucella melitensis 16 M {{contains}} 31 genes {{clustered in}} three loci {{on the small}} chromosome. These genes encode a polar sheathed flagellum that is transiently expressed during vegetative growth and required for persistent infection in a mouse model. By following the expression of three flagellar genes (fliF, flgE, and fliC, corresponding to the MS <b>ring,</b> <b>hook,</b> and filament monomer, respectively), we identified a new regulator gene, ftcR (flagellar two-component regulator). Inactivation of ftcR led to a decrease in flagellar gene expression and to impaired Brucella virulence. FtcR has a two-component response regulator domain as well a DNA binding domain and is encoded in the first flagellar locus of B. melitensis. Both the ftcR sequence and its genomic context are conserved in other related α-proteobacteria. During vegetative growth in rich medium, ftcR expression showed a peak during the early exponential phase that paralleled fliF gene expression. VjbR, a quorum-sensing regulator of the LuxR family, was previously found to control fliF and flgE gene expression. Here, we provide some new elements suggesting {{that the effect of}} VjbR on these flagellar genes is mediated by FtcR. We found that ftcR expression is partially under the control of VjbR and that the expression in trans ftcR in a vjbR mutant restored the production of the hook protein (FlgE). Finally, FtcR binds directly to the upstream region of the fliF gene. Therefore, our data support the role of FtcR as a flagellar master regulator in B. melitensis and perhaps in other related α-proteobacteria. Copyright © 2007, American Society for Microbiology.
