40|$|The {{most common}} method of roof framing {{employed}} by Australian builders in modern construction {{is the use}} of pre-fabricated nail plated timber roof trusses. These trusses are predominantly manufactured from structural framing timber limited in length to a maximum of 6 metres. The style and size of houses increasingly preferred by Australian homeowners means that trusses are regularly required to span further than 6 metres. Truss manufacturers therefore use larger or additional nail plates to splice members during fabrication, and the assembly process becomes far more complex. Finger jointing of sawmill off-cuts and other short lengths of timber is a means of manufacturers economically producing timber in longer lengths. This dissertation investigates the suitability of using <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> structural timber for the fabrication of nail plated roof trusses. Physical testing and statistical analysis has been used to compare the performance of <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> structural timber with standard structural framing timber normally used in truss fabrication. This study involved characterizing the mechanical properties of the timber, as well as assessing the performance of joints including mechanical fasteners. These methods, along with the static modelling of loading situations, were also used to quantify the probability of inducing failures unique to <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber, during the truss fabrication and erection process. These investigations concluded that <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber could be produced with equivalent mechanical properties to standard framing timber. Joints manufactured from <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> and solid structural timber also exhibited no significant difference in performance. Furthermore, failures unique to <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber could occur during fabrication and erection, however, the probability of these, under normal use conditions, is generally quite low. ...|$|E
40|$|Background Compared with {{traditional}} open surgery, {{minimally invasive surgery}} may improve recovery and patient satisfaction while maintaining surgical principles. Laparoscopic, single incision, natural orifice, and robotic approaches hold their own appeal. However, they lack the ability to manipulate organs as easily as the human hand. Advances in minimally invasive surgical techniques require new tools with increased functionality of the end effectors. Multifunctional tools with greater dexterity than those currently available are highly desired. Methods To address this need, we designed, fabricated, and tested the first prototype of a laparoscopic tool that provides the dexterity of a hand. The “hand” has two <b>jointed</b> <b>fingers</b> and a <b>jointed</b> thumb attached to a laparoscopic sheath that can be collapsed to fit through a 12 -mm trocar or small orifice. The handle provides control for three independent degrees of freedom: finger motion (bending/spreading), fingertip bending, and thumb bending. The tool {{can be used for}} pinching, grasping, and spreading motions. Furthermore, the thumb is “double jointed” so that the tool can be converted to a rake configuration to allow lifting motions. The initial prototype has been tested in a cadaver lab to demonstrate its utility. Results Our “lap-hand” was used to complete standard surgical tasks in a simulation device in a time comparable to open and laparoscopic approaches, including “bowel” manipulation and peg movement. Cadaver testing confirmed the ability to grasp, elevate, and move liver, stomach, colon, and small bowel in a fashion expected by the hand. No adverse events were noted, and no bowel injury or perforation resulted from over-grasping. Conclusions We have designed, built, and tested a first prototype of an artificial hand for minimally invasive surgery. Use of such tools could both reduce the number of hand-incisions required and potentially transition more patients to undergo their abdominal procedures laparoscopically...|$|R

40|$|The {{issue on}} {{variability}} of mechanical properties within wood has {{found to be}} increasingly prominent in recent years. On the other hand, {{it is known that}} uniformity of wood properties is essential in quality control in the timber manufacturing such as manufacturing of Glued Laminated (Glulam) timber. The AS/NZS 1328 P 2 specified that the overall mechanical properties of Glulam timber can be estimated based on the MOE of the <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> laminates and the arrangement of the corresponding laminates. In relating to the above standard, optimisation in the arrangement of shooks’ location along the <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> laminate will enable determination of the overall MOE of laminates, as well as optimise the utilisation of feedstocks. In this study, a deterministic model was developed in relating the local shook’s modulus of elasticity (MOE) with the overall MOE of the corresponding <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber based on the principle of the Moment of Curvature. The projected overall MOE is calculated as a function of lengths and MOEs of individual shooks in the finger joint timber. The effect of shooks’ location can also be determined from the model. Numerical derivation of the model was addressed and the analyses of the relationships between the local shook MOEs, the overall MOE, and bending strength (MOR) were assessed. Experimental results showed that the model can effectively predicts the overall MOE, particularly on shook combinations with random and large standard deviations in shook MOEs. The errors of the predictive model were ranged from - 8. 17 % to + 0. 81 %. Results from the assessment on the relationships between the overall MOE and bending MOR indicated that wood failure in the combinations of small standard deviations shook MOEs was most likely to occur at the weakest point, however, wood failures may not necessarily occur in the shook with the lowest MOE in the asymmetrical MOE arrangements. This also applies to the <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber with combinations of shooks with large standard deviations for local MOEs. In addition, the relationship between dynamic MOE of shooks and the static bending overall MOE were assessed. A linear regression has been suggested for the adjusted shooks dynamic MOE at 36 mm thickness. The predictability of the model could further improve when the shook MOEs were sorted according to sawing pattern and the proposed model for quarter sawn is suggested. Lastly, economic analysis was performed based on the models available in literature and the developed model in this study. Models reported in the literature including the arithmetic mean model and model based on the shook’s minimum MOE. The results from economic analysis showed that the study’s model was most cost effective in predicting the cost of shooks based on the predicted overall <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> MOE using the model as compare to the arithmetic mean and the minimum shook MOE method. In conclusion, the proposed model has demonstrated to be unique, simple, effective and robust in predictive applications...|$|E

40|$|Design {{models for}} timber {{structures}} in fire usually {{take into account}} the loss in cross-section due to charring and the temperature-dependent reduction in strength of timber. For bonded timber elements like glued laminated timber beams it is assumed that the adhesive used does not influence the resistance of structural timber beams significantly. To investigate the fire resistance of bonded timber elements a comprehensive research project is currently in progress at the Institute of Structural Engineering of ETH Zurich, Switzerland. The aim of this research project is the development of a simplified design model for the fire resistance of bonded structural timber elements taking into account the behavior at elevated temperature of the adhesive used. This paper presents experimental analyses and results of first calculations performed on the influence of the adhesive on the load-carrying capacity of glued laminated timber members in fire. It is shown that the temperature-dependent material properties of the adhesive used in the bondline of glued laminated timber beams have small influence on the shear resistance. For the investigated timber beams failure occurs mainly due to exceeding the bending moment resistance. Because of the steep temperature gradient in timber beams during fire exposure the temperature in the inner region of the cross-section is rather low; hence the shear capacity in the bondline between the different lamellas is still sufficient. However, in case of <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> lamellas of glued laminated timber beams, the influence of adhesive used in the finger joints is more significant and has to be considered. Tensile tests at elevated temperatures on <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> specimens confirmed the significant influence of the adhesive used...|$|E

Limited information is available on end gluing hardwoods in contrast to softwoods, which have been extensively investigated and industrially utilized (Pena 1999). Non-structural products include furniture, cladding, fencing, in-ternal and external joinery. In structural uses finger jointing is finally the major method to end joint timber for the production of glue-laminated wood (Koch 1972, Jokerst 1981, Nestic and Milner 1993). The other methods to end joint timber (butt and scarf joint) did not find industrial acceptance (River 1994). There are no experimental results for finger-jointed oakwood in Greece. Oak is the most abundant tree species in Greece (746 400 ha) and covers 49 % of the broadleaved Greek forests (about 2. 5 mil-lion ha).

However, in practical problems the parameters of distribution are unknown and can only be estimated from random samples. Therefore the characteristic value is by itself a random variable. The estimates of characteristic values are strongly dependant {{on the distribution of}} random variable. In the paper we show the analytical solution for characteristic value determination from random samples of normal and lognormal random variables. The confirmation of analytical results is accomplished by the use of computer simulations. For Gumbel, and Weibull distribution the characteristic value estimates are obtained numerically by combination of simulations and bisection method. In the paper the numerical results are presented for 5 % characteristic values with 75 % confidence interval, which is in accord with the majority of European building standards.

Requirements for material properties and guidelines for the manufacturing process and the factory's internal quality control are composed in DIN 68140 - 1 and DIN EN 385. However, to support quality assurance and to avoid quality problems, nondestructive testing (NDT) methods are requested. Possible methods for NDT of finger joints can be taken from the numerous publications about NDT of wood. These methods are reviewed and evaluated regarding the special features of <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> timber: For ultrasound transmission (perpendicular to the wood fiber or diagonally through the joint) transmitters and receivers have to be coupled well to the timber. Stress-wave techniques along the beam are easier to apply but the measured parameters (stress wave velocity, frequency spectrum) and evaluation methods have to be selected very carefully to localize weak zones. Excitation and measurement of bending vibrations is easy to handle as well but this method works properly only if weak joints in the beam affect the vibration modes. A novel method is local ultrasound excitation together with a thermographic detection of heat which is generated by friction in splits or poorly glued joints. Among the mechanical techniques stress-grading (bending test) is not suitable for large cross-sections and proof-loading (tension test) is a destructive method.

40|$|The United States {{residential}} construction industry, traditionally the largest end-use market for softwood lumber, has been undergoing {{a period of}} change {{for more than a}} decade. Builders’ acceptance of substitute materials and new innovations has increased, providing a unique challenge to softwood lumber producers. In such a situation, understanding the ways in which residential builders specify and use softwood lumber and lumber substitutes is essential to the success of any softwood lumber manufacturer. The Center for International Trade in Forest Products (CINTRAFOR) completed its first study on material substitution in 1995 (CINTRAFOR Working Paper No. 57), providing a benchmark for softwood lumber use in structural applications in {{residential construction}}. This was followed by surveys looking at material use in 1998 (CINTRAFOR Working Paper No. 73) and 2001 (CINTRAFOR Working Paper No. 93). The current study, undertaken in 2005, represents the fourth in this series and is intended to describe the trends in material use and substitution in the residential construction industry in 2004. The 2005 survey also explores builders’ awareness, usage and perceptions of certified softwood lumber and sets a baseline for tracking certified lumber usage in residential construction. In 2004, single family construction accounted for over three-quarters of construction firms’ revenue. The larger firms reported a high proportion of new single family housing than their smaller counterparts. Additionally, {{there appears to be a}} negative relationship between firm size and the amount of revenue generated from repair and remodel activities. These findings are consistent with previous survey findings. The 2005 survey also reveals that the larger firms are more involved in non-residential construction. Builders in the southwest region of the US reported significantly less involvement in the repair and remodeling sector and significantly more involvement in the non-residential sector. The share of single family construction reported by builders was found to be consistent across all regions. A longitudinal analysis (from 1998 to 2004) of substitute material usage revealed that the largest changes occurred in the usage of glulam beams, LVL, steel framing, wood I-joists, open-web trusses, and structural insulated panels, with wood I-joists, LVL, steel framing and glulam beams recording significant decreases between 2001 and 2004. In contrast, structural insulated panels, panelized wall systems and open-web trusses have experienced an increase in use since 2001. Survey respondents in the southeast and southwest regions of the country reported a steady increase in their usage of <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> lumber between 1998 - 2004. However, the usage of <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> lumber nationally was found to be constant over this period. The usage of glulam beams decreased substantially in the eastern US while remaining fairly constant in the western US. Nationally, glulam beams recorded the largest drop in reported use (12. 6 %). Use of wood I-joists declined across all regions, with the exception of the northwest, as solid wood joist prices moderated. In addition, use of Parallam TM remained relatively constant between 1998 and 2004, whereas the use of TimberStrandTM lumber increased in the western US while declining in the eastern US. The use of non-wood material substitutes (steel framing and reinforced concrete) generally declined in the southern regions and increased in the northeast. An analysis of material usage within specific end-use applications revealed that softwood lumber use has either increased or remained relatively constant in all applications with the singular exception of load bearing walls. For headers, wall framing and roof framing applications, softwood lumber remained the dominant material with a market share of more than 70 % in each application. For floor framing, the market is split between softwood lumber, wood I-joists and open-web trusses. However, it should be noted that for all structural applications, softwood lumber recorded the largest market share. The market share for softwood lumber increased in floor and roof framing applications, remained constant in header and non-load bearing wall applications and declined in load bearing wall applications. In wall framing applications, none of the substitute materials had a market share of more than 6 % whereas softwood lumber (both solid sawn and finger-jointed studs) enjoyed a market share of approximately 88. 3 % and 80. 9 % in non-load bearing and load bearing wall applications, respectively. The usage of softwood lumber in floor framing increased from 39 % in 2001 to 43 % in 2004, making softwood lumber the primary material for floor joists. Significantly, the market share for wood I-joists in flooring applications (its major market) declined by almost 12 %. The use of wood trusses for roof framing has experienced a steady increase since 1995, rising from a market share of 46 % in 1995 to 53 % in 2004. Builders rated strength, straightness, lack of defects and the availability of softwood lumber as the most important attributes of softwood lumber; a result that has been consistent over the course of the four surveys. The importance ratings for two attributes, price and price stability, have begun to decline in importance. On a positive note, home builders consistently expressed higher satisfaction levels with all of the softwood lumber attributes in the 2005 survey. A review of the data shows that the respondents consistently recorded higher satisfaction levels for all the softwood lumber material attributes between 2001 and 2004. The 2005 survey also marks the first time that builders indicated satisfaction with two important softwood lumber quality attributes: lumber straightness and lack of defects. In all of the previous surveys, builders had consistently indicated dissatisfaction with both of these attributes. The fact that straightness and lack of defects are ranked as two of the most important lumber attributes, combined with the large increase in the satisfaction ratings for both of these attributes, suggests that builders have begun to view softwood lumber as a much better value over the past several years. It appears that builders are becoming more conscious of the environment and that this is beginning to influence the types of materials specified by some builders. Unfortunately, builders are receiving mixed messages about the environmental performance of non-wood materials. The results of this survey suggest that builders perceptions of the environmental performance of non-wood materials improved slightly between 2001 and 2004 whereas it decreased substantially for wood-based structural materials. With the exception of SIP’s, all of the substitute materials are considered to be more enviromentally friendly than softwood lumber. This result sugggests that it is important that the forest products industry in general, and softwood lumber manufacturers in particular, continue to educate builders about the environmental benefits of using wood relative to non-wood materials. A new section of the 2005 survey considered home builders awareness and use of certified lumber. The results of the survey showed that only 40 % of homebuilders indicated that they were aware of certified wood. On average, only about 14 % of homebuilders indicated that they have used certified wood. Among the users of certified lumber, the average percentage of homes framed with certified lumber was approximately 50 %. Almost 15 % of the builders who have used certified wood reported that they framed all of their houses with certified lumber. Further, in considering builders’ awareness and use of certified wood within individual states, the survey data suggest that awareness of certified wood was higher among builders located in the eastern US (42. 7 %) and along the west coast (45. 2 %) than in the central US (32. 2 %). However, among those builders who were aware of certified wood, the percentage of builders who reported using it was much higher on the west coast (50 %) than in either the eastern US (29. 2 %) or the central US (38. 1 %). Previous research has shown that the willingness of customers to pay higher prices for certified wood plays a major role in the usage of certified lumber. This research shows that only 17 % of the respondents in the eastern states and 29 % of the respondents in the central states believe that their customers would be willing to pay higher prices for homes built using certified wood products. The percentage for respondents in the west coast states was higher at 50 %. These survey results suggest that the awareness and usage of environmentally certified wood among builders is much higher on the west coast relative to the rest of the country. The survey results suggest that in the future large home builders may well lead the effort to increase the use of certified wood in building homes. This observation is based on the fact that 67 % of large builders have heard of certified wood (this represents the largest segment for this question), 43 % have used certified wood to build homes (this is the second largest segment for this question), 50 % think that their customers would be willing to pay a premium for a home built from certified wood (this represents the largest segment for this question) and 75 % expect that their use of certified wood will increase in the future (this represents the largest segment for this question). Further research is needed to understand home builders’ motivation for using certified wood and to explore the relationship between the use of certified wood and regulatory factors (such as green building codes and efforts to improve the energy efficiency of residential homes) ...|$|E
40|$|The US {{residential}} construction industry, traditionally the largest market for softwood lumber, {{has undergone a}} period of uncharacteristically rapid change over the past decade. The effects of timber harvest restrictions in federal and state forests on softwood lumber price, price volatility, and product quality, combined with technological advances by producers of substitute materials, have contributed to increased use of material substitutes in {{residential construction}}. The objective {{of this research was}} to assess the extent of material substitution in residential construction and provide insight into the factors driving these changes. The results offer convincing evidence that softwood lumber has continued to lose market share in the residential construction industry and that builders remain concerned about its quality and price. The study also shows a shift on the part of builders towards a more favorable impression of the environmental impacts of substitute products, including steel and concrete, relative to softwood lumber. This study is based on a random sample of 2, 400 residential construction firms segmented by geographic region and firm size. The survey was also mailed to the 100 largest home builders, as reported in Builder magazine. The overall response rate was 12. 8 % (12. 1 % of the random sample and 37. 1 % of the 100 largest firms). The results show that residential builders have steadily increased their use of substitute structural materials since 1995. Respondents reported increased use of all of substitute materials included in the survey. Almost all respondents reported using at least one substitute material (compared to 91 % in 1995) and over 80 % of the respondents reported using glulam beams, wood I-joists, and laminated veneer lumber (LVL). While use of steel, reinforced concrete and plastic-fiber lumber increased, engineered wood products emerged as the clear winners. On a regional basis, builders in the western US reported higher usage of all substitute products. In addition, the survey data suggest that large firms were more likely than small firms to try new substitute products, particularly <b>finger</b> <b>jointed</b> lumber, structural insulated panels, laminated veneer lumber, as well as newer engineered wood products such as parallel strand lumber and laminated strand lumber. The survey data were analyzed to assess the extent to which various structural products were used in walls, floors, and roofs, the three end-use applications that consume the greatest volume of structural lumber. The most commonly used products were softwood lumber, steel lumber, finger-jointed lumber, wood trusses, LVL, and wood I-joists. While softwood lumber still dominated wall framing in 1998, with an 83 % market share, it has lost market share (down from 93 % in 1995), particularly among large firms. Softwood lumber’s share of the floor framing market declined from 59 % in 1995 to 42 % in 1998. While it is still the most widely used product, with a 42 % market share, the market share of wood I-joists has increased from 23 % in 1995 to 39 % in 1998. Softwood lumber used to frame roof rafters is no longer the dominant material used in residential roof systems. Survey data show that wood trusses increased slightly from 46 % to 48 %, while softwood lumber declined from 51 % to 40 %. To assess builders’ satisfaction with softwood lumber, respondents were asked to rate the level of the importance, and their corresponding level of satisfaction, with 13 softwood lumber attributes. The importance ratings obtained in 1998 were virtually identical to those reported in 1995. Softwood lumber straightness, strength, availability, and lack of defects were rated as the most important attributes. The survey data suggest that price is much more important to large firms than small firms. Builders reported that, while they were more satisfied with the price and price stability of softwood lumber in 1998 relative to 1995, they remained unhappy with softwood lumber quality, particularly with respect to lumber straightness and overall occurrence of defects. A gap analysis highlighted the difference between the mean importance ratings (where 7 indicates “extremely important” and 1 indicates “not important at all”) and the mean satisfaction ratings for each product attribute (where 7 indicates “extremely satisfied” and 1 indicates “extremely dissatisfied”). Survey findings indicate that while builders are less concerned with price issues than in 1995, they remain very concerned about the perceived decline in softwood lumber quality. The data provide clear evidence that residential home builders are least satisfied with product attributes they rate most important, suggesting that builders are dissatisfied with the value (defined as the ratio of price/quality) of softwood lumber. To provide a more concise interpretation of the importance and satisfaction of the different softwood lumber attributes, a factor analysis was performed to group together those softwood lumber attributes that are highly correlated to each other. The results of the factor analysis are almost identical with the results obtained from the 1995 survey and suggest that the 13 product attributes used to describe softwood lumber can be summarized into three factors: quality attributes, economic attributes, and technical attributes. Finally, the survey assessed builders’ perceptions of the environmental impact associated with using substitute products relative to softwood lumber. Although environmental marketing is not prevalent in the US forest products industry, most industry observers believe that it will become more important. While reduced environmental impact had the lowest importance rating of the 13 softwood lumber attributes, survey findings revealed that more builders in 1998 had a favorable perception of the environmental impact of substitute products, including steel and concrete, over softwood lumber than in 1995. This survey clearly indicates that softwood lumber has continued to be displaced by substitute materials in segments of the residential construction industry that it has traditionally dominated: walls, floors, and roofs. To a large degree, this loss of market share can be attributed to a perception among residential builders that the value of softwood lumber has declined: a direct result of rising prices and a perceived drop in lumber quality. Much of the loss in market share experienced by softwood lumber {{can be attributed to the}} increased use of engineered wood products. Many would argue that this is a normal process of product evolution within the forest products industry, attributed to technological advances in manufacturing processes driven by the changing forest resource. However, this study identified two trends that should concern managers in the forest products industry. First, the use of nonwood substitute building materials has increased significantly since 1995. Second, there is a growing perception among home builders that using non-wood building materials (including steel and reinforced concrete) is better for the environment than using softwood lumber. This trend away from wood products is likely to continue unless there is an effective response to the challenge posed by substitute materials...|$|E
