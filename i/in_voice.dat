5|$|Allison Moore, {{a college}} friend of Tartakovsky, was cast as Dee Dee. She left the show {{after the first}} season because {{she was no longer}} {{interested}} <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> acting.

5|$|Random House {{published}} an abridged audiobook in 2007, directed by John Mc Elroy and produced by Dan Zitt, with sound editing by Charles De Montebello. The book is read by Brooks but includes other actors {{taking on the}} roles of the many individual characters who are interviewed in the novel. Brooks' previous career <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> acting and voice-over work meant he could recommend a large number of the cast members.|$|E
5|$|The northwestern crow (C. caurinus) is {{very closely}} related to the American crow. Its {{ancestors}} became separated by Ice Age glaciation west of the Rocky Mountains. It is endemic to Pacific temperate rain forests where it all but replaces the American crow. Only in the Seattle region do they co-occur to any extent. In form the two species are much alike. There is a marked difference <b>in</b> <b>voice.</b>|$|E

5|$|In {{addition}} to the repeating A or N modulation signal, each transmitting station would also transmit its two-letter Morse code identifier once every thirty seconds for positive identification. The station identification would be sent twice: first on the N pair of transmitters, then on the A, to ensure coverage in all quadrants. Also, in some installations local weather conditions were periodically broadcast <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> over the range frequency, preempting the navigational signals, but eventually this was done on the central fifth tower.|$|E

5|$|Many reviews {{commented on}} the {{graphics}}, citing there were other games with better graphics at the time. GamePro rated the graphics at 3.5 out of 5. Though the graphics were not well received, the character animations were very well received. The lack of audio dialog, which forced the player to read text for the story mode, was also a negative when many other games on the PS2 {{at the time were}} adding <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> overs. GamePro rated the overall sound a 3 out of 5. Other reviews rated the audio better, particularly the music and sound effects during the fights.|$|E
5|$|Servo {{controlled}} subwoofers are not {{the same}} as Servodrive subwoofers whose primary mechanism of sound reproduction avoids the normal voice coil and magnet combination in favor of a high-speed belt-driven servomotor. The Servodrive design increases output power, reduces harmonic distortion and virtually eliminates the loss of loudspeaker output that results from an increase <b>in</b> <b>voice</b> coil impedance due to overheating of the voice coil (called power compression.) This feature allows high power operation for extended periods of time. Intersonics was nominated for a TEC Award for its Servo Drive Loudspeaker (SDL) design in 1986 and for the Bass Tech 7 model in 1990.|$|E

25|$|Darrell Eastlake {{is shown}} as an {{over-the-top}} and exuberant personality, which doesn't always {{sit well with}} Richie.

25|$|Sébastien, popular melody or voix populi to a loud, {{so it has}} a tenor tessitura phonic. The tessitura of {{this voice}} type will be typical of a common tenor, albeit with a lighter tone sans operatic training.
