5|$|The {{common cold}} is {{generally}} mild and self-limiting with most symptoms generally improving in a week. Half of cases go away in 10days and 90% in 15days. Severe complications, if they occur, are {{usually in the}} very old, the very young, or those who are <b>immunosuppressed.</b> Secondary bacterial infections may occur resulting in sinusitis, pharyngitis, or an ear infection. It is estimated that sinusitis occurs in 8% and ear infection in 30% of cases.|$|E
5|$|Treatment {{of chronic}} {{infection}} in women prior to or during pregnancy {{does not appear}} to reduce the probability the disease will be passed on to the infant. Likewise, it is unclear whether prophylactic treatment of chronic infection is beneficial in persons who will undergo immunosuppression (for example, organ transplant recipients) or in persons who are already <b>immunosuppressed</b> (for example, those with HIV infection).|$|E
5|$|Diagnosing active {{tuberculosis}} {{based only on}} signs and symptoms is difficult, as is diagnosing the disease in those who are <b>immunosuppressed.</b> A diagnosis of TB should, however, be considered in those with signs of lung disease or constitutional symptoms lasting longer than two weeks. A chest X-ray and multiple sputum cultures for acid-fast bacilli are typically part of the initial evaluation. Interferon-γ release assays and tuberculin skin tests are of little use in the developing world. Interferon gamma release assays (IGRA) have similar limitations in those with HIV.|$|E

Immunopathogenesis of CNS fungal infections remains incompletely understood, with most of our understanding coming from studies on experimentally infected animals.

40|$|Utilising {{immunohistochemistry}} it {{has been}} investigated which cells {{of the immune system}} in which proportion to each other and in which timely sequence are infiltrating the graft after penetrating keratoplasty in the rat eye. After transplantation the rats had been treated with different <b>immunosuppressing</b> or tolerogenic agents. The rat strains used as donor and recipient are different in their MHC antigens so that transplantation in untreated animals always leads to allograft rejection. Blocking the CD 4 antigen expressed on T-helper cells by treating the animals with the monoclonal anti-CD 4 antibody RIB 5 / 2 leads to much less infiltration of the graft by all cell populations investigated. This is probably due to the increased secretion of Th 2 -cytokines by T-helper cells on antigen recognition after blocking the CD 4 -molecule. Th 2 -cytokines are <b>immunosuppressing</b> in the context of allograft rejection. This is corresponding to the clinical observation that most of the animals treated with the anti-CD 4 antibody are not rejecting their graft. Treatment with Leflunomide or with Cyclosporine remained without effect in this setting. These results support the view that CD 4 + T-cells although not destroying the infiltrated tissue themselves are of central importance in allograft rejection because of their initialising role and that blocking normal T-cell function may interrupt allograft reaction in the cornea. Treatment with anti-CD 4 antibodies seems to be a promising alternative in preventing allograft rejection after penetrating keratoplasty. </p...|$|R

25|$|Hemorrhagic {{complications}} {{are more}} common in the immunocompromised or <b>immunosuppressed</b> populations, although healthy children and adults have been affected. Five major clinical syndromes have been described: febrile purpura, malignant chickenpox with purpura, postinfectious purpura, purpura fulminans, and anaphylactoid purpura. These syndromes have variable courses, with febrile purpura being the most benign of the syndromes and having an uncomplicated outcome. In contrast, malignant chickenpox with purpura is a grave clinical condition that has a mortality rate of greater than 70%. The cause of these hemorrhagic chickenpox syndromes is not known.|$|E
40|$|Using an ELISA for the {{detection}} of virus-specific immune complexes, ten cows were found to be shedding bovine enteric coronavirus. The shedding patterns from five of these animals were followed for a period of 12 weeks, and all were found to be chronically shedding virus. Despite the presence of both faecal and serum antibody the infection was not cleared; therefore, the role of cell-mediated immunity (CMI) was investigated by <b>immunosuppressing</b> the chronically shedding cows with dexamethasone. No major role for CMI in maintaining the chronic infection could be determined, although immunosuppression did result in a temporary reduction in the shedding of virus-specific immune complexes...|$|R
40|$|Varroa mites (Varroa destructor) are ectoparasites {{of honey}} bees (Apis mellifera) and cause serious damage to bee colonies. The {{mechanism}} of how varroa mites kill honey bees remains unclear. We {{have addressed the}} effects of the mites on bee immunity and the replication of a picorna-like virus, the deformed wing virus (DWV). The expression of genes encoding three antimicrobial peptides (abaecin, defensin, and hymenoptaecin) and four immunity-related enzymes (phenol oxidase, glucose dehydrogenase, glucose oxidase, and lysozyme) were used as markers to measure the difference in the immune response. We have demonstrated an example of an ectoparasite <b>immunosuppressing</b> its invertebrate host with the evidence that parasitization significantly suppressed expression of these immunity-related genes. Given that ticks <b>immunosuppress</b> their vertebrate hosts, our finding indicates that immunosuppression of hosts may be a common phenomenon in the interaction and coevolution between ectoparasites and their vertebrate and invertebrate hosts. DWV viral titers were significantly negatively correlated with the expression levels of the immunity-related enzymes. All bees had detectable DWV. Mite-infested pupae developed into adults with either normal or deformed wings. All of the deformed-wing bees were greatly infected by DWV (≈ 106 times higher than varroa-infested but normal-winged bees). Injection with heat-killed bacteria dramatically promoted DWV titers (105 times in 10 h) in the mite-infested, normal-winged bees to levels similar to those found in mite-infested, deformed-wing bees. Varroa mites may cause the serious demise of honey bees by suppressing bee immunity and by boosting the amplification of DWV in bees exposed to microbes...|$|R

25|$|Pegylated {{interferon}} (PEG IFN) is dosed {{just once}} a week as a subcutaneous injection and is both more convenient and effective than standard interferon. Although it does not develop resistance as do many of the oral antivirals, it is poorly tolerated and requires close monitoring. PEG IFN is estimated to cost about $18,000 {{per year in the}} United States, compared to $2,500-8,700 for the oral medications; however, its treatment duration is 48 weeks as opposed to the oral antivirals, which require indefinite treatment for most patients (minimum 1 year). PEG IFN is not effective in patients with high levels of viral activity and cannot be used in <b>immunosuppressed</b> patients or those with cirrhosis.|$|E
25|$|MPyV is {{primarily}} spread among mice via the intranasal route and is shed in urine. Genetic susceptibility to MPyV infection among mice varies significantly, {{and not all}} MPyV strains are oncogenic. In general, only newborns and <b>immunosuppressed</b> mice (usually transgenic) develop tumors upon infection; although originally observed {{as a cause of}} parotid gland tumors, the virus may induce solid tumors {{in a wide variety of}} tissue types of both epithelial and mesenchymal origin. Although viruses in circulation among feral mice can be tumorigenic, under natural conditions the virus does not cause tumors; maternal antibodies have been shown to be critical in protecting neonates. It has been described as rare in modern laboratory mouse research colonies.|$|E
25|$|Warts {{caused by}} the Xipapillomavirus group have a cauliflower-like {{appearance}} and can attain {{the size of a}} fist; most common on the head, neck and shoulders, they may also occur in other locations. Cutaneous fibropapillomas caused by Deltapapillomavirus group have a nodular appearance. Although unsightly, most skin warts rarely cause problems except in show animals. However, large warts may bleed, potentially leading to secondary infections, and florid warts of the teat can cause mastitis and interfere with suckling and milking. Fibropapillomas can be troublesome when present in the genital area, causing pain and sometimes loss of reproductive functions as well as interfering with calving. Chronically <b>immunosuppressed</b> animals may develop extensive papillomatosis in the upper gastrointestinal tract, which can cause difficulties with eating and breathing.|$|E

40|$|TH 1 {{has been}} {{suggested}} to be the dominant and pro-tective immune response against malaria both in rodents and humans [1, 2]. Yet the blood stage of Plasmodium falciparum can serve to <b>immunosuppress</b> the host’s im-mune response to the liver stage of the parasite [3] Dendritic cell maturation is inhibited by P. falciparum-infected red blood cells (RBCs) [4]; monocyte maturation is also suppressed by malaria pigments (haemozoin), and low serum IL- 12 was reported in severe malaria [5, 6]. These observations suggest that the IL- 12 -driven TH 1, IFNγ-dominant response patterns seen following P. falcip-arum infection may not be functioning optimally; thus, against this background data, one may ask how the in-fected host is capable of mounting an effective TH 1 re-sponse against the blood-borne stage of this parasite?

Throughout the episode Foreman displays a passionately emotional side and at one point breaks down, stating that in many ways he is no better than from where he came simply because his ego has gotten in the way. In the following episode, Foreman is seen for the first time praying or meditating in the hospital chapel, despite the fact that he has expressed being fairly nonreligious before.|$|R
25|$|In 2010, over 400 {{cases of}} cowpox {{infection}} from cats to human have been described. The symptoms differ between both humans and cats. In people, local exanthema {{appears on the}} arms and face. The infection resolves on its own but those who are <b>immunosuppressed</b> can progress to systemic infection that closely resembles smallpox. When the infection has expanded to severe symptoms, it can be lethal. The signs of cowpox infection in cats can be seen as, multiple skin sores on the paws, neck, head and mouth. The cat can also develop a purulent discharge from the eyes. Necrotizing pneumonia has also been observed. Estimates that 50% of human cases of cowpox are due to transmission from cats in the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|Although {{patients}} {{are encouraged to}} wash their hands, avoid sick people, and take other infection-reducing steps, about 85% of infections are due to naturally occurring microorganisms in the patient's own gastrointestinal tract (including oral cavity) and skin. This may manifest as systemic infections, such as sepsis, or as localized outbreaks, such as Herpes simplex, shingles, or {{other members of the}} Herpesviridea. The risk of illness and death can be reduced by taking common antibiotics such as quinolones or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole before any fever or sign of infection appears. For every five people who are <b>immunosuppressed</b> following chemotherapy who take an antibiotic, one fever can be prevented; for every 34 who take an antibiotic, one death can be prevented. Sometimes, chemotherapy treatments are postponed because the immune system is suppressed to a critically low level.|$|E
25|$|Patients with MDR-TB {{should be}} {{isolated}} in negative-pressure rooms, if possible.

Some physicians will insist that these patients are isolated until their sputum is smear negative, or even culture negative (which may take many months, or even years). Keeping these patients in hospital for weeks (or months) on end may be a practical or physical impossibility and the final decision depends on the clinical judgement of the physician treating that patient. The attending physician should make full use of therapeutic drug monitoring (particularly of the aminoglycosides) both to monitor compliance and to avoid toxic effects.|$|E

40|$|AbstractDendritic cells (DCs) {{are the key}} {{linkage between}} innate and adoptive immune response.

50|$|An {{important}} {{question in the}} field of immunology is how the immunosuppressive activity of regulatory T cells is modulated during the course of an ongoing immune response. While the immunosuppressive function of regulatory T cells prevents the development of autoimmune disease, it is not desirable during immune responses to infectious microorganisms. Current hypotheses suggest that, upon encounter with infectious microorganisms, the activity of regulatory T cells may be downregulated, either directly or indirectly, by other cells to facilitate elimination of the infection. Experimental evidence from mouse models suggests that some pathogens may have evolved to manipulate regulatory T cells to <b>immunosuppress</b> the host and so potentiate their own survival. For example, regulatory T cell activity has been reported to increase in several infectious contexts, such as retroviral infections (the most well-known of which is HIV), mycobacterial infections (like tuberculosis), and various parasitic infections including Leishmania and malaria.|$|R
5000|$|Inflammatory response. Human {{cells have}} receptors that {{recognize}} pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs). When bacteria bind to these receptors, they activate signaling cascades {{such as the}} NF-kB and MAPK pathways. This leads to expression of cytokines, immunomodulating agents, such as interleukins and interferons which regulate immune response to infection and inflammation. Several bacterial effectors affect NF-kB signaling. For instance, the EPEC/EHEC effectors NleE, NleB, NleC, NleH, and Tir are <b>immunosuppressing</b> effectors that target proteins in the NF-kB signaling pathway. NleC {{has been shown to}} cleave the NF-kB p65 subunit (RelA), blocking the production of IL-8 following infection. [...] NleH1, but not NleH2, blocks translocation of NF-kB into the nucleus. [...] The Tir effector protein inhibits cytokine production. [...] Similarly, YopE, YopP, and YopJ (in Yersinia enterocolitica, Yersinia pestis, and Yersinia pseudotuberculosis respectively) target the NF-kB pathway. YopE inhibits activation of NF-kB, which in part prevents the production of IL-8.|$|R
