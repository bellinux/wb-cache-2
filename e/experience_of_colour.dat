50|$|Sonochromatism or sonochromatopsia (Latin: sono-, (sound) + Greek: chromat- (colour) + Greek: -opsia (seeing)) is a {{neurological}} phenomenon in which colours {{are perceived as}} sounds. The phenomenon is created by the union between a brain and a colour-to-sound software or chip. People who report such experiences are known as sonochromats. The term was coined by Neil Harbisson to differentiate his <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> from people with chromesthesia or colour-to-sound synesthesia.|$|E

50|$|The main {{difference}} between chromesthesia and sonochromatism is that sonochromatism {{is not the}} union between two existing senses, instead, it {{is the creation of}} a new sense. Sonochromats do not necessarily sense colour as a visual experience and are able to perceive colours outside the limits of human vision such as infrareds and ultraviolets. Their <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> is not involuntary, instead, it is caused by voluntary action such as a colour-to-sound chip implant or constant use of an eyeborg. The sounds perceived for each colour are not subjective, they are objective and they are related to the light frequencies of colour.|$|E
50|$|Grapheme-colour {{synaesthesia}} or coloured grapheme synesthesia {{is a form}} of synesthesia {{in which}} an individual's perception of numerals and letters is associated with the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours.</b> Like all forms of synesthesia, Grapheme-colour synesthesia is involuntary, consistent, and memorable.

40|$|Colour Relationalism {{asserts that}} colours are non-intrinsic or {{inherently}} relational properties of objects, properties that depend {{not only on}} a target object but in addition on some relation(s) that object bears to other objects. The most powerful argument for Relationalism (Cohen 2009) infers the inherently relational character <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> from cases in which one’s <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> a <b>colour</b> contextually depends on one’s <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> other <b>colours.</b> <b>Experienced</b> colour layering—say looking at grass through a tinted window and experiencing opaque green through transparent grey—demands a contextual interdependency <b>of</b> one’s <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> one <b>of</b> these <b>colours</b> on one’s <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> the other. However, {{most if not all}} colour ontologies, and core perceptual experiential mechanisms like acquaintance and representation, can accommodate colour layering. It follows that experienced colour layering is consistent with colours being non-relational—this contextual interdependency <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> does not entail the constitutive dependency <b>of</b> one <b>colour</b> on the other. I utilize colour layering to examine the inference from the contextual to the constitutive interdependency <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> as it is employed in a well-known argument for Relationalism. I conclude that our justification for Relationalism is far weaker than Relationalists suggest. I first introduce readers to colour layering, then to Relationalism, and following this focus on the intersection of these topics...|$|R

In this pilot study, I tested two research methods, for enabling architects, artists and colour designers to conceptualise their <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> architectural <b>colours,</b> particularly in terms of the design process. The first method referred to as colour walk, is an ethnographic walking method. Colour walk allows the designer to provide words for non-verbal <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> in architecture and to create concepts for the artistic colour design process. The second method, visual ethnographic photography is both a method for documentation and an approach for conducting artistic research concerning the atmosphere of architecture focusing on colours.

Kentridge, Heywood and Weiskrantz have furthermore shown that a patient with an extensive lesion to their striate cortex does not even extract contrast signals and responds behaviourally only to the wavelength of light.

5000|$|A famous {{formulation}} of the qualia objection comes from Frank Jackson (1982) {{in the form of}} the Mary's room thought experiment. Let us suppose, Jackson suggests, that a particularly brilliant super-scientist named Mary has been locked away in a completely black-and-white room her entire life. Over the years in her colour-deprived world she has studied (via black-and-white books and television) the sciences of neurophysiology, vision and electromagnetics to their fullest extent; eventually Mary comes to know all the physical facts there are to know about experiencing colour. When Mary is released from her room and experiences colour for the first time, does she learn something new? If we answer [...] "yes" [...] (as Jackson suggests we do) to this question, then we have supposedly denied the truth of type physicalism, for if Mary has exhausted all the physical facts about experiencing colour prior to her release, then her subsequently acquiring some new piece of information about colour upon experiencing its quale reveals that there must be something about the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> which is not captured by the physicalist picture.

40|$|Familiar {{facts about}} perceptual {{variation}} presents a long standing {{problem for the}} view that colours are mind-independent properties.

40|$|An {{enduring}} {{question in}} cognitive neuroscience {{is how the}} physical properties {{of the world are}} represented in the brain to yield conscious perception. In most people, a particular physical stimulus gives rise to a unitary, unimodal perceptual experience. So, light energy leads to the sensation of seeing, whereas sound waves produce the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> hearing. However, for individuals with the rare phenomenon of synaesthesia, specific physical stimuli consistently induce more than one perceptual experience. For example, hearing particular sounds might induce vivid <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour,</b> taste or odour, as might the sight of visual symbols, such as letters or digits. Here we review the latest findings on synaesthesia, and consider its possible genetic, neural and cognitive bases.

25|$|Frank Jackson {{formulated}} his well-known knowledge argument {{based upon}} similar considerations. In this thought experiment, known as Mary's room, he {{asks us to}} consider a neuroscientist, Mary, who was born, and has lived all of her life, in {{a black and white}} room with a black and white television and computer monitor where she collects all the scientific data she possibly can on the nature <b>of</b> <b>colours.</b> Jackson asserts that as soon as Mary leaves the room, she will come to have new knowledge which she did not possess before: the knowledge <b>of</b> the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> (i.e., what they are like). Although Mary knows {{everything there is to know}} about colours from an objective, third-person perspective, she has never known, according to Jackson, what it was like to see red, orange, or green. If Mary really learns something new, it must be knowledge of something non-physical, since she already knew everything about the physical aspects <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> is a core {{element of}} human vision. Colours provide {{important}} symbolic and contextual information not conveyed by form alone. Moreover, the <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> can arise without external stimulation. For many people, visual memories are rich with colour imagery. In the unusual phenomenon of grapheme-colour synaesthesia, achromatic forms such as letters, words and numbers elicit vivid experiences of colour. Few studies, however, {{have examined the}} neural correlates of such internally generated colour experiences. We used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI) to compare patterns of cortical activity for the perception of external coloured stimuli and internally generated colours in a group of grapheme-colour synaesthetes and matched non-synaesthetic controls. In a voluntary colour imagery task, both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes made colour judgements on objects presented as grey scale photographs. In a synaesthetic colour task, we presented letters that elicited synaesthetic colours, and asked participants to perform a localisation task. We assessed the neural activity underpinning these two different forms of colour experience that occur in the absence of chromatic sensory input. In both synaesthetes and non-synaesthetes, voluntary colour imagery activated the colour-selective area, V 4, in the right hemisphere. In contrast, the synaesthetic colour task resulted in unique activity for synaesthetes in the left medial lingual gyrus, an area previously implicated in tasks involving colour knowledge. Our data suggest that internally generated colour experiences recruit brain regions specialised for colour perception, with striking differences between voluntary colour imagery and synaesthetically induced colours.

During two months, the evolution of his colour vision deficit was followed with repeated standardized colour vision tests and eye movement recordings. While his performance continuously improved, he became more and more aware of the deficit. Only after colour vision had almost normalized, his subjective colour sensation was inconspicuous again. The simultaneous occurrence of achromatopsia and the corresponding anosognosia and their parallel recovery suggest that both deficits were due to dysfunction of the same brain region. Consequently, the subjective <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> loss in achromatopsia may depend on the residual function of the damaged colour centre...|$|E
40|$|Colour vision plays a {{foundational}} explanatory role in {{the philosophy}} of colour, and serves as perennial quarry in the wider philosophy of perception.

I argue that two subjects exactly alike in respect of their constitutive colour vision abilities could differ in respect of whether or not they have categorical perception of colour. The argument is supported by thought experiment and dissociations observed in cognitive neuropsychology. The argument also bears connections to recent neo-Whorfian accounts of colour categorisation...|$|E

40|$|This study corroborates {{the view}} that perceptual {{categorisation}} does not require linguistic categories, and simple tasks like ordering colours {{on the basis of}} their similarities evince well-structured perceptual categories, defined relatively to visual perception and independently from experience, language, and higher-level cognition. The independence of these categories from experience, language, and higher-level cognition would be an argument for their naturalness, and hence for their universality, and for their role in shaping language itself. On the other hand, the influence of language on colour perception would come about by facilitating perception-controlled behaviours. The ordering procedure which rests on perceptual similarity yields a colour system in which perceptual categories are implicit and yet clear and stable. In fact, it shows that whatever speakers in whatever language community share the same <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> The arguments presented favour the ‘universalist’ thesis and are important in regard to both the research methodology and interpretation of the experimental data.

40|$|In bright light, cone-photoreceptors {{are active}} and colour vision derives from a {{comparison}} of signals in cones with different visual pigments. This comparison begins in the retina, where certain retinal ganglion cells have ‘colour-opponent’ visual responses—excited by light <b>of</b> one <b>colour</b> and suppressed by another colour. In dim light, rod-photoreceptors are active, but colour vision is impossible because they all use the same visual pigment. Instead, the rod signals are thought to splice into retinal circuits at various points, in synergy with the cone signals. Here we report a new circuit for colour vision that challenges these expectations. A genetically identified type of mouse retinal ganglion cell called JAMB (J-RGC), {{was found to have}} colour-opponent responses, OFF to ultraviolet (UV) light and ON to green light. Although the mouse retina contains a green-sensitive cone, the ON response instead originates in rods. Rods and cones both contribute to the response over several decades of light intensity. Remarkably, the rod signal in this circuit is antagonistic to that from cones. For rodents, this UV-green channel {{may play a role in}} social communication, as suggested by spectral measurements from the environment.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: In {{cases of}} {{incomplete}} achromatopsia {{it is unclear}} whether residual visual function is mediated by intact striate cortex or results from incomplete lesions to extrastriate cortical visual areas. A patient with complete cerebral achromatopsia was tested to establish the nature of his residual vision and to determine the integrity of striate cortex function. METHODS: Behavioural contrast sensitivity, using the method of adjustment, and averaged visually evoked cortical potentials were measured to sinusoidally modulated chromatic and achromatic gratings in an achromatopsic patient and a normal observer. Eye movements were measured in the patient using a Skalar infrared monitoring system. RESULTS: The patient's chromatic contrast sensitivity was normal, indicating that despite his dense colour blindness his occipital cortex still processed information about spatial variations in hue. His sensitivity to achromatic gratings was depressed particularly at high spatial frequencies, possibly because of his jerk nystagmus. These behavioural results were reinforced by the nature of visually evoked responses to chromatic and achromatic gratings, in which total colour blindness coexisted with an almost normal cortical potential to isoluminant chromatic gratings. CONCLUSIONS: The results show that information about chromatic contrast is present in some cortical areas, and coded in a colour-opponent fashion, {{in the absence of any}} perceptual <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour...</b>|$|E
40|$|It seems a {{compelling}} idea that <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> plays some {{role in our}} having concepts of the various colours, but in trying to explain the role experience plays {{the first thing we}} have to describe is what sort of colour experience matters here.

As I will explain this idea, {{it is a matter of}} being able to use experience to inform linguistic or conceptual thought about what would happen were there to be various interventions on an object. Against this background, I will review Locke’s fundamental argument that since we can change the colour of an almond by pounding it, there must be an error embodied in our ordinary concepts of colour: there is no such thing as intervening directly on the colour of an object. The analysis I present brings out the force of Locke’s argument.

40|$|Based {{on our own}} {{observations}} and on scientific and scholarly references this paper discusses the appearance of colour constancy and the adaptation of colour and lightness in space. It presents {{part of an ongoing}} work, the aim of which is to formulate a spatially based colour knowledge. Our scientific approach is holistic and mainly directed towards colour and light phenomena as such, not towards underlying physiological processes. Earlier research has discussed lightness perception in colours very near neutral grey, with so low chromaticness that you can ignore the hue. In our research we have found that surfaces with nominally chromatic colours under special circumstances can be perceived as white and thus serve as anchors for perception of other colours in the field of vision. We also discuss how distinctions are made between perceived colours caused by on the light colour and such caused by the surface qualities. What we call adaptation is not limited to basic perception. <b>Experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour</b> in space is both perceptive and cognitive, as part of interaction between the individual and the world on many levels.  SYN-TES: Human colour and light synthesis.

25|$|Research {{also shows}} their visual <b>experience</b> <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> {{is not very}} {{different}} from humans'. The eyes are actually a mechanism that operates {{at the level of}} individual cones and makes the brain more efficient. This system allows visual information to be preprocessed by the eyes instead of the brain, which would otherwise have to be larger to deal with the stream of raw data and thus require more time and energy. While the eyes themselves are complex and not yet fully understood, the principle of the system appears to be simple. It is similar in function to the human eye but works in the opposite manner. In the human brain, the inferior temporal cortex has a huge amount of colour-specific neurons which process visual impulses from the eyes to create colourful experiences. The mantis shrimp instead uses the different types of photoreceptors in its eyes to perform the same function as the human brain neurons, resulting in a hardwired and more efficient system for an animal that requires rapid colour identification. Humans have fewer types of photoreceptors, but more colour-tuned neurons, while mantis shrimps appears to have fewer colour neurons and more classes of photoreceptors.|$|R
40|$|Mechanisms of {{attention}} {{play a crucial}} role in filtering sensory inputs from the external world, allowing information to be prioritised for goal directed behaviour. To what extent might these same capacity-limited processes influence grapheme-colour synaesthesia, in which letters, numbers or words evoke concurrent <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour?</b> Asking synaesthetes themselves whether attention seems important in their experiences has provided a range of answers. On the one hand, for some synaesthetes, diverting attention can diminish the quality <b>of</b> their synaesthetic <b>colours.</b> On the other, there are suggestions that synaesthetic experiences can themselves alter the manner in which attention is allocated to sensory stimuli in the environment. Here, we review a range of empirical investigations that have examined the role {{of attention}} in grapheme-colour synaesthesia. A particular focus of these studies has been the extent to which an inducing stimulus - such as an achromatic letter or digit - must be attended or consciously perceived to trigger a concurrent synaesthetic experience. In most cases, limiting attention or masking inducers tends to reduce or eliminate behavioural evidence <b>of</b> synaesthetic <b>experiences.</b> We also discuss how synaesthesia might improve performance in visual search tasks through post-attentive processes such as grouping, or by facilitating decision-making processes. 18 page(s...|$|R
40|$|In grapheme-colour synaesthesia, {{letters and}} digits elicit vivid and highly {{consistent}} <b>experiences</b> <b>of</b> <b>colour.</b> Typically, the conscious experience is unidirectional: digits elicit colours but colours do not elicit digits. If synaesthesia reflects an involuntary connection between representations, however, {{a link between}} a digit and colour should have some bidirectional effects. Recent evidence shows subtle bidirectional interference effects reflecting this implicit link. Here, we examined whether the implicit activation of a digit by a colour for grapheme-colour synaesthetes could aid their performance, and whether this reflected slow strategic or rapid effortless processing. We presented grapheme-colour synaesthetes with a stream of coloured squares, {{and asked them to}} report the colours in order {{at the end of each}} trial. Within a trial, all the colours were individually presented for 200 ms (fast condition) or 500 ms (slow condition). The colours were matched to each synaesthete's colours for the digits one to nine. In half the trials, the order <b>of</b> the <b>colours</b> corresponded to part or all of a sequence of numbers (e. g., red, green, blue if 1 =red, 2 =green, 3 =blue). For the other trials, there was no sequence in the order <b>of</b> <b>colours.</b> If synaesthetes activate, either involuntarily or strategically, the digit that typically elicits the colour when viewing colours, they should be able to use the sequential information to aid the recall <b>of</b> <b>colours</b> in order. Early results suggest that the synaesthetes were able to recall sequential colour sequences more accurately than pseudo-randomized colours. This effect appears greatest for the slow condition, where there is time for strategic transformation, suggesting that synaesthetes are able to use their unusual experiences to effectively cue recall...|$|R
