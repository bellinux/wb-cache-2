50|$|However, {{for music}} organisations, {{communities}} and special projects that were generating shareable data in non-MARC format, {{we had to}} explore and develop a methodology to harvest, map and convert {{a wide range of}} data types into MARC, <b>initially</b> <b>converting</b> the data via MODS to MARC, and stored in MARCXML.

40|$|Digital Elevation Model (DEM), while {{providing}} a bare earth look, is heavily {{used in many}} applications including construction modeling, visualization, and GIS. Their registration techniques have not been explored much. Methods like Coarse-to-fine or pyramid making are common in DEM-to-image or DEM-to-map registration. Self-consistency measure is used to detect any change in terrain elevation and hence was used for DEM-to-DEM registration. But these methods apart from being time and complexity intensive, lack in error matrix evaluation. This paper gives a method of registration of DEMs using specified height values as control points by <b>initially</b> <b>converting</b> these DEMs to ASCII files. These control points may be found by two mannerisms - either by direct detection of appropriate height data in ASCII files or by edge matching along congruous quadrangle of the control point, followed by sub-graph matching. Error analysis for the same has also been done.

40|$|Azo dyes {{are very}} {{resistant}} to light-induced fading and biodegradation. Existing advanced oxidative pre-treatment methods {{based on the}} generation of non-selective radicals cannot efficiently remove these dyes from wastewater streams, and post-treatment oxidative dye removal is problematic because it may leave many byproducts with unknown toxicity profiles in the outgoing water, or cause expensive complete mineralization. These problems could potentially be overcome by combining photocatalysis and biodegradation. A novel visiblelight-responsive hybrid dye removal agent featuring both photocatalysts (g-C 3 N 4 -P 25) and photosynthetic bacteria encapsulated in calcium alginate beads was prepared by selfassembly. This system achieved a removal efficiency of 94 % for the dye reactive brilliant red X- 3 b and also reduced the COD of synthetic wastewater samples by 84. 7 %, successfully decolorized synthetic dye-contaminated wastewater and reduced its COD, demonstrating the advantages of combining photocatalysis and biocatalysis for wastewater purification. The composite apparently degrades X- 3 b by <b>initially</b> <b>converting</b> the dye into aniline and phenol derivatives whose aryl moieties are then attacked by free radicals to form alkyl derivatives, preventing the accumulation of aromatic hydrocarbons that might suppress microbial activity. These alkyl intermediates are finally degraded by the photosynthetic bacteria. </p...|$|E
30|$|To meet {{increasing}} energy needs, while limiting {{greenhouse gas}} emissions over the coming decades, power capacity {{on a large scale}} will need to be provided from renewable sources, with solar expected to play a central role. While the focus to date has been on electricity generation via photovoltaic (PV) cells, electricity production currently accounts for only about one-third of total primary energy consumption. As a consequence, solar-to-fuel conversion will need to play an increasingly important role and, thereby, satisfy the need to replace high energy density fossil fuels with cleaner alternatives that remain easy to transport and store. The solar refinery concept (Herron et al. in Energy Environ Sci 8 : 126 – 157, 2015), in which captured solar radiation provides energy in the form of heat, electricity or photons, used to convert the basic chemical feedstocks CO 2 and H 2 O into fuels, is reviewed as are the key conversion processes based on (1) combined PV and electrolysis, (2) photoelectrochemically driven electrolysis and (3) thermochemical processes, all focused on <b>initially</b> <b>converting</b> H 2 O and CO 2 to H 2 and CO. Recent advances, as well as remaining challenges, associated with solar-to-fuel conversion are discussed, as is the need for an intensive research and development effort to bring such processes to scale.|$|E
