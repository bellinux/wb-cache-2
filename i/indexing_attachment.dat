40|$|In principle, {{the rules}} of links {{formation}} of a network model {{can be considered as}} a kind of link prediction algorithm. By revisiting the preferential attachment mechanism for generating a scale-free network, here we propose a class of preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>indices</b> which are different from the previous one. Traditionally, the preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>index</b> is defined by the product of the related nodes degrees, while the new indices will define the similarity score of a pair of nodes by either the maximum in the two nodes degrees or the summarization of their degrees. Extensive experiments are carried out on fourteen real-world networks. Compared with the traditional preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>index,</b> the new ones, especially the degree-summarization similarity index, can provide more accurate prediction on most of the networks. Due to the improved prediction accuracy and low computational complexity, these proposed preferential <b>attachment</b> <b>indices</b> may be of help to provide an instruction for mining unknown links in incomplete networks.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the food impaction between implant prostheses and adjacent natural teeth. Materials and methods: For this study, 51 patients with food impaction were selected and investigated mobility, tightness of contact area, gingival <b>index,</b> plaque <b>index,</b> <b>attachment</b> loss, alveolar bone level, proximal caries, marginal ridge distance and occlusal relationships. Results: Food impaction was found in the upper teeth (60. 7 %) more than the lower teeth (39. 2 %). Food impaction was occurred on mesial side of implant prostheses (86. 2 %) more than distal side (13. 7 %). Food impaction was mostly found in loose or open contact area (94. 2 %). Food impaction was frequent on stepped relationship between implant and adjacent teeth. Conclusion: Treatment plan should include proper adjacent and antagonistic occlusal plane and occlusal surface, to prevent food impaction, and the plan should include less adjacent tooth mobility with proper tightness between implant prostheses and adjacent teeth.

Our analyses revealed: a) gender differences in attachment to parents, with females reporting stronger attachment than males, and age differences in attachment to parent and peer, with middle adolescents reporting stronger attachment than adolescents; b) gender differences in Internalizing problems and Total problems, with females reporting higher scores than males, and age differences, with adolescents reporting higher scores than middle adolescents. Internalizing problems were predicted by Alienation by parents and Trust (IPPA-Peer) dimension in the expected directions, and Externalizing problems were predicted only by parental attachment dimensions.

40|$|Biotic stress may {{operate in}} concert with {{physical}} environmental conditions to limit or facilitate invasion processes while altering competitive interactions between invaders and native species. Here, we examine how endolithic parasitism of an invasive and an indigenous mussel species acts in synergy with abiotic conditions of the habitat. Our {{results show that the}} invasive Mytilus galloprovincialis is more infested than the native Perna perna and this difference is probably due to the greater thickness of the protective outer-layer of the shell of the indigenous species. Higher abrasion due to waves on the open coast could account for dissimilarities in degree of infestation between bays and the more wave-exposed open coast. Also micro-scale variations of light affected the level of endolithic parasitism, which was more intense at non-shaded sites. The higher levels of endolithic parasitism in Mytilus mirrored greater mortality rates attributed to parasitism in this species. Condition <b>index,</b> <b>attachment</b> strength and shell strength of both species were negatively affected by the parasites suggesting an energy trade-off between the need to repair the damaged shell and the other physiological parameters. We suggest that, because it has a lower attachment strength and a thinner shell, the invasiveness of M. galloprovincialis will be limited at sun and wave exposed locations where endolithic activity, shell scouring and risk of dislodgement are high. These results underline the crucial role of physical environment in regulating biotic stress, and how these physicalbiological interactions may explain site-to-site variability of competitive balances between invasive and indigenou...|$|R

40|$|Background: Previous {{research}} has demonstrated that a history of childhood maltreatment can lead to significant negative consequences across multiple domains of functioning. A significant minority of individuals remain resilience to such negative consequences, necessitating further research into the factors which protect against negative outcomes in young people who have experienced adversity. A systematic review of the literature was carried out in order to assess the evidence base for factors that predict adolescent resilience following childhood maltreatment. Several factors across the individual, family and community level were identified, however, evidence regarding these factors was mixed. Factors that have been shown to predict resilience in other age groups require further validation within adolescent samples. Aim: The first aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the role of resilience in the relationship between childhood maltreatment and psychological distress. The second aim was to address a possible role for attachment in mediating the relationship between childhood maltreatment and resilience. Method: Adolescents aged 13 – 17 who were attending Child and Adolescent Mental Health Services were asked to complete measures of childhood maltreatment, individual resilience, attachment and psychological distress. Results: Resilience was shown to mediate the relationship between maltreatment and psychological distress. Attachment avoidance was found to mediate the relationship between maltreatment and resilience but not when emotional reactivity was included in the resilience <b>index.</b> <b>Attachment</b> anxiety did not mediate the relationship between maltreatment and resilience, however, maltreatment history was found to moderate the relationship between attachment anxiety and resilience.

40|$|Purpose: The grey-bluish {{discoloration}} of gingiva (known as “amalgam tattoo”) {{does not}} appear only {{in the presence of}} amalgam restorations. It may also be seen in cases of teeth restored with cast dowels and porcelain-fused-to-metal (PFM) restorations. The aim of this article was to determine the clinical characteristics of abutment teeth with gingival discoloration. Materials and Methods: This research was conducted on 25 patients referred for cast dowel and PFM restorations. These restorations were manufactured from Ni-Cr alloys. Ninety days after cementing the fixed prosthodontic restorations, the abutment teeth (n= 61) were divided into a group with gingival discoloration (GD) (n= 25) and without gingival discoloration (NGD) (n= 36). The control group (CG) comprised the contralateral teeth (n = 61). Plaque index, gingival <b>index,</b> clinical <b>attachment</b> level, and probing depth were assessed before fabrication and also 90 days after cementation of the PFM restorations. Results: The gingival <b>index,</b> clinical <b>attachment</b> level, and probing depths of the abutment teeth that had GD were statistically higher before restoration, in comparison with the abutment teeth in theNGDand control groups. Ninety days after cementation, the abutment teeth with GD had significantly lower gingival indexes and probing depths, compared to the abutment teeth in the NGD group. Both abutment teeth groups (GD and NGD) had significantly higher values of clinical attachment levels when compared to the control group. Therewere no statistically significant differences in plaque index values between the study groups. Conclusions: The results of this study indicated that impairment of periodontal status of abutment teeth seemed {{to be related to the}} presence of gingival discolorations. Therefore, fabrication of fixed prosthodontic restorations requires careful planning and abutment teeth preparation to minimize the occurrence of gingival discolorations. Clinical relevance: With careful preparation of abutment teeth for cast dowels and crown restorations it may be possible to decrease the frequency of gingival discolorations adjacent to abutment teeth.

The aim of this paper was to assess whether the mass spectrometric analysis of gingival crevicular fluid may allow for the site-specific prediction of periodontal disease progression. MATERIAL AND METHODS: Forty-one periodontal maintenance subjects were followed over 12 mo, with clinical measurements taken at baseline and every 3 mo thereafter. Gingival crevicular fluid was collected from subjects at each visit and was analysed using matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight (MALDI-TOF) mass spectrometry. Samples were classified based upon pocket depth, modified gingival index (MGI), plaque <b>index</b> and <b>attachment</b> loss, and were analysed within these groups. A genetic algorithm was used to create a model based on pattern analysis to predict sites undergoing attachment loss. RESULTS: Three hundred and eighty-five gingival crevicular fluid samples were analysed. Twenty-five sites under observation in 14 patients exhibited attachment loss of > 2 mm over the 12 -mo period. The clinical indices pocket depth, MGI, plaque levels and bleeding on probing served as poor discriminators of gingival crevicular fluid mass spectra. Models generated from the gingival crevicular fluid mass spectra could predict attachment loss at a site with a high specificity (97 % recognition capability and 67 % cross-validation). CONCLUSIONS: Gingival crevicular fluid mass spectra could be used to predict sites with attachment loss.

Moreover, the relationship among the oxidative damage biomarkers, antioxidant enzymes activities and clinical periodontal status were investigated. Methods: Whole saliva samples were collected from 30 patients with chronic periodontitis and 30 periodontally healthy control. To determine the clinical condition of each subject, the plaque index, gingival <b>index,</b> clinical <b>attachment</b> level, and probing depth were measured. The salivary 8 -OHdG level was measured using the ELISA method. SOD and GPx activities and MDA levels were determined spectrophotometrically. Results: Higher salivary 8 -OHdG and MDA levels (P<. 001), and lower salivary SOD and GPx activities (P<. 05) were detected in periodontitis patients compared to the healthy controls. Additionally, there were significant negative correlations between salivary levels of 8 -OHdG and both salivary SOD and GPx activities as well as between salivary levels of MDA and both salivary SOD and GPx activities (P<. 001).

The use of algorithm-generated models based on gingival crevicular fluid mass spectra may provide utility in the diagnosis of periodontal disease.

40|$|Objective : To use the {{periosteum}} as {{a barrier}} in treatment of buccal Grade II furcation defects of lower molars. Materials and Methods : This technique was performed on 12 patients with bilateral buccal Grade II furcation defects of lower molars. On a random basis, one furcation defect of each pair was selected {{for the control group}} and other for the experimental group. Debridement was done in the defect area in both groups. In the control group, after debridement, mucoperiosteal flap was sutured back. In the experimental group, after reflection of the mucoperiosteal flap, a portion of the periosteum along with a layer of connective tissue (periosteal membrane) was incised and mobilized in the defect area for defect coverage {{as a barrier}}, and then the periosteal membrane and mucoperiosteal flap were fixed with suture, respectively. Horizontal dimension of the furcation defect was the primary outcome measure. Gingival <b>index,</b> probing <b>attachment</b> level (PAL), and vertical dimension of furcation defect were the secondary outcome measures. Clinical parameters were registered at baseline and at 6 months. Results : Every clinical parameter was improved by surgery. Significant gain in PAL as well as horizontal and vertical dimensions of the furcation defects was found. Conclusion: This periosteum displacement technique is effective for the treatment of buccal Grade II furcation defects of lower molars...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} three {{factors that may}} predict attachment patterns and behavior problems of children in foster care: length of time in a single foster home, presence of biological and/or adopted children in the foster home, and parenting stress. Participants included 50 primarily African American 8 to 12 year old foster children and their foster caregivers. Data were obtained using the Parenting Stress <b>Index,</b> Beech Brook <b>Attachment</b> Disorder Questionnaire, and Child Behavior Checklist. Correlations revealed that high negative attachment and low positive attachment {{were significantly related to}} greater behavior problems. Regression analyses revealed that time in a single foster home {{was a significant predictor of}} positive attachment, with more time in the current placement related to less positive attachment. Trends further indicated that presence of other children and extended time in a single foster home predicted high negative attachment. Implications of the findings for practitioners and policy makers are discussed...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} {{the efficacy of the}} attachment-based Circle of Security 20 -week intervention in improving child behavioural and emotional functioning. Participants were 83 parents of children (1 – 7 years) referred to a clinical service with concerns about their young children’s behaviour. Parents (and teachers, when available) completed questionnaires assessing child protective factors, behavioural concerns, internalizing and externalizing problems, prior to and immediately after the intervention. The following were considered as potential moderators: child gender and age, parent representations, reflective functioning, child <b>attachment</b> <b>indices</b> and severity of presenting problems, prior to treatment. Results showed significant improvement for parent ratings of child protective factors, behavioural concerns, internalizing and externalizing symptoms, all ps <. 05, and children with more severe problems showed most improvement. Teachers also reported improvements, but change was significant only for externalizing problems (p =. 030). Findings suggest Circle of Security is effective in improving child behavioural and emotional functioning in clinically referred children aged 1 – 7 years. 23 page(s...|$|R
40|$|Many {{defects in}} {{macrophage}} functions in dengue type 2 virus (DV) infection {{have been shown}} to be mediated by production of the virus-induced cytotoxic factor (CF). An attempt has been made to determine whether the alterations in Fc-mediated functions of macrophages in DV-infected mice are due to CF. Mice given CF intravenously show a rapid fall in total numbers of peritoneal and spleen cells. The number of cells in the peritoneal cavity recovered in 48 h. but recovery in the spleen was not significant. The capacity of the splenic and peritoneal macrophages to attach and ingest opsonized sheep erythrocytes was significantly reduced, the lowest values of <b>attachment</b> <b>index</b> (AI) and phagocytic index (PI) being observed within 2 - 3 h. At later periods the AI values increased markedly but the PI values remained depressed. The effect was dose-dependent. The effect on Fc-receptor functions of macrophages in DV-infected mice thus appears to be mediated through CF...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} was to evaluate the survival rates at 12 months of transmucosal implants placed in the posterior mandible and immediately restored with single crowns. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Thirty ITI dental implants with sandblasted, acid-etched surfaces were placed in 30 patients missing at least 1 mandibular molar and immediately restored if acceptable primary stability was attained. Primary stability was measured with resonance frequency analysis (RFA) using the Osstell device, and only implants with a stability quotient greater than 62 {{were included in the}} study. RFA measurement and radiographic assessment were made at baseline and 6 months after implant placement. Plaque Index, Bleeding <b>Index,</b> probing depth, <b>attachment</b> level, and width of keratinized tissue were measured at the 12 month follow-up examination. RESULTS: At 12 months, only 1 implant had been lost; it was removed because of acute infection. Radiographic as well as clinical examination confirmed osseointegration of all implants, with a survival rate of 96. 7...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to explore the possibility that variations in attachment security exhibited by infants in the Ainsworth Strange Situation at 13 months could be predicted from the behavior of mothers and infants in an analogous preseparation, separation and reunion situation at 7 months, when specific attachments begin to emerge. Data obtained on a large sample of 7 -month-old infants and their mothers were subjected to factor analyses to identify important variables and interrelationships. Based on these analyses, variables were incorporated into multiple discriminant function analyses of a subsample of infants, with infant attachment classification at 13 months as the criterion. The results suggest that a) attachment security {{at the end of the}} first year can be significantly predicted from a brief observation of mother-infant interaction at seven months; b) predictability is influenced by observational context (e. g., preseparation vs reunion); and c) multivariate procedures are useful in detecting relationships and continuities among <b>attachment</b> <b>indices...</b>|$|R
40|$|Two {{studies are}} {{described}} {{that attempt to}} determine if standard-scale-reduction techniques could yield a construct-valid diagnostic screen of pathology of separation-individuation for use in nonclinical university set-tings. In Study 1 (A / = 210). a measure of pathology of separation-individuation (PATHSEP) was reduced successfully to a single, internally consistent factor, accounting for 36 % of the variance. In Study 2 (A / = 304), these items also coalesced around a single factor, accounting for 35 % of the variance. Study 2 also showed that PATHSEP is correlated moderately and positively with <b>indices</b> of insecure <b>attachment,</b> with the Center for Epidemiological Studies—Depression Scale, and with indices of psychiatric symptomatology (Hopkins Symptom Checklist). PATHSEP also {{was associated with a}} poorer profile of adjustment to college. Males reported more pathology of separation-individuation than did females. Evidence supports the construct validity of a shortened version of PATHSEP. Direc-tions for future research are noted. © 2001 John Wiley & Sons, Inc...|$|R
