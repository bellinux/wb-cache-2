5000|$|Financial Darwinism [...] {{analyzes}} the dominant global forces behind the tectonic financial shift {{that has taken}} place in finance of the past quarter century and then comprehensively explores the challenges facing financial institutions as well as the universe of their potential responses. Conceptually, it consists of two highly interrelated parts. The first one is the evolutionary thesis called Dynamic Finance. This thesis explains the origins and drivers of the profound changes in the global financial landscape. Tilman proposes that the basic key to understanding the behavior of modern financial institutions and capital markets lies in the recognition {{of the fact that the}} process of economic value creation in finance has undergone a fundamental transformation. More specifically, due to significant margin pressures on basic financial businesses, active risk taking has begun to play an increasingly dominant role how financial institutions create (and destroy) shareholder value. In order to demonstrate this, the book introduces the concept of risk-based economic performance that helps depart from the outdated accounting-earnings-inspired mental paradigm. Throughout, the dynamism of risk-taking and business decisions is emphasized as a distinguishing characteristic of the dynamic new world vis-à-vis the old <b>financial</b> <b>regime.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{formulate}} {{and solve}} {{a range of}} dynamic models of information-constrained credit that allow for moral hazard and unobservable investment. We compare them to full insurance and exogenously incomplete <b>financial</b> <b>regimes</b> (autarky, saving only, and borrowing and lending in a single asset). We develop computational methods based on mechanism design, linear programming, and maximum likelihood to estimate, compare, and statistically test these alternative theoretical models of financial constraints. Our methods work with both cross-sectional and panel data and allow for measurement error and unobserved heterogeneity. Empirically, we find that using consumption, income, and investment data jointly, or using intertemporal data, improves the researcher’s ability to distinguish across the <b>financial</b> <b>regimes</b> relative to using consumption or investment data alone, especially {{in the presence of}} high measurement error. We estimate the models using data on Thai households running small businesses. We find that, overall, the borrowing and saving only regimes provide the best fit using joint data on consumption, investment, and income. However, there is evidence that family networks are helpful in consumption smoothing as in a moral hazard constrained regime and that there are regional differences in the best fitting regime (higher-wealth, near Bangkok vs. rural agricultural areas) ...|$|R

50|$|When {{they first}} {{occupied}} Tunisia in 1881, the French had compelled the Bey, Muhammad III as-Sadiq, {{to sign the}} Treaty of Bardo. To avoid provoking a reaction from other European powers {{with an interest in}} the country, the terms of this treaty were very limited. They allowed French military occupation of certain places, thereby undermining a Tunisian sovereignty which was not legally clear, since the Regency of Tunis acknowledged, at least notionally, the authority of the Ottoman Empire. Most importantly, through the Treaty of Bardo, the French government guaranteed the fulfillment of existing treaty obligations between the Regency and various European powers under the capitulations. The French Republic and the Bey of Tunis also agreed to establish a new <b>financial</b> <b>regime,</b> ensuring that the public debt was serviced and the rights of international creditors protected. These provisions effectively removed any grounds other powers might have for objecting to the French intervention, and therefore served France's short-term interests. In the longer term however, France wished not to preserve but to remove the interests of other powers from the country, so that they could control it exclusively. The major obstacle to this was the International Debt Commission which had been set up in 1869, so a new treaty was required to provide the means of abolishing it.|$|E

The main objective is to reveal {{the evidence of the}} both phenomena, soft budget constraints and credit rationing, investigating investment behaviour of large farms in Ukraine. Our empirical analysis is based on unbalanced panel data containing 529 agricultural enterprises from three Ukrainian regions between 2001 and 2005. Estimates of the Euler investment equation for several sub-samples reveal a dissimilar level of financial constraints. We confirm the presence of the soft financial environment (soft budget constraints) for the Ukrainian large farms being in an unconstrained <b>financial</b> <b>regime.</b> The farms belong to this regime if they receive credits after being unprofitable in two consecutive years. The other farms defined a priori as being in an constrained <b>financial</b> <b>regime</b> face evidence of credit rationing.

40|$|The {{degree to}} which {{bankruptcy}} is permitted {{to play a role}} in the allocation of capital is a key distinction between the Asian state-directed <b>financial</b> <b>regime</b> and the Western market-directed version. The paper discusses the two approaches to finance and argues that a major problem with the bank finance model used in many Asian countries is its minimization of bankruptcy risks. A three-sector development model (agriculture, manufacturing, and financial sector) is developed and simulated to compare the outcomes of the two approaches separately and then to evaluate the transition costs of switching from a state- to a market-directed <b>financial</b> <b>regime.</b> The simulation results suggest that the market approach results in a higher long-run growth path because it eliminates inefficient firms through bankruptcy. The results also suggest that switching from a state- to a market-directed model can be very costly to the economy, though the transition costs can be lowered somewhat by a delayed and phased-in liberalization. At the same time, a delayed and phased-in approach may induce other difficulties not considered in the model. Several policy implications are drawn from the model and simulation results; for example, development of an infrastructure to provide for orderly bankruptcy and the development of money and capital markets should be given high priority in the liberalization process.
