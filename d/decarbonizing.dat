40|$|Continued {{release of}} {{greenhouse}} gas emissions, primarily emitted from combustion of fossil fuels, will result in further global warming, increasing the risk of severe and irreversible impacts for humans and ecosystems. An integrated mitigation approach combining deployment of energy efficiency measures, <b>decarbonizing</b> electricity generation sector and transformation of end-use fuels can be a feasible and cost-effective solution. State of California has adopted deep GHG emission reduction target of 80 percent below 1990 levels by 2050, but <b>decarbonizing</b> the power supply sector cannot lead to such aggressive emission reductions by itself. Therefore, widespread electrification, i. e. switching direct fossil fuel use to electricity, is essential for meeting deep emission reduction targets. The infrastructural transformation and the technology path required for achieving this ambitious GHG reduction goal are not well understood. This thesis analyzes grid and emission impacts of electrifying end-use sectors while <b>decarbonizing</b> power generation, using detailed modeling of infrastructure stocks and economic dispatch of electric grid. A set of scenarios are developed to study the impacts of electrification where each end-use sector is electrified based on the electrification potential and feasibility of implementation using the available electric technologies. In order to accommodate higher statewide electricity demand due to electrification, the electricity generation sector is decarbonized through installing higher levels of renewable power. Results show that <b>decarbonizing</b> power sector without electrifying end-use sectors reduce GHG emissions only by 8 percent, while electrification of end-use sectors alongside <b>decarbonizing</b> electricity generation yields up to 40 percent GHG emission reductions compared to 1990 levels...|$|E

Over the past half century, energy law has endured many stranded cost experiments, each helping firms and customers adjust to a new normal. However, these past experiments have contributed to a myopic regulatory approach to past stranded cost recovery by: (1) endorsing a preference for addressing all stranded costs only after energy resource investment decisions have been made; and (2) fixating on the firm’s financial costs and protection of investors, rather than on the broader impacts of each transition for the energy system. The current transition to decarbonization is already giving rise to stranded cost claims related to existing energy assets like coal-fired and nuclear power plants. New energy infrastructure investments—such as natural gas pipelines and natural gas-fired power plants—will also face stranded cost issues once they have provided the expected bridge to a clean energy future. We see the transition to grid decarbonization as a propitious opportunity for energy law to improve its approach to stranded cost compensation for investor risks.
