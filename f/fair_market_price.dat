5|$|Stanley {{called the}} General Assembly into special session in February 1917. At issue was reformation of the state's tax code, which Stanley felt {{unjustly}} burdened agricultural interests. The state was also incurring large deficits, ranging from $100,000 to $700,000 annually. Though Kentucky was {{in better shape}} financially than many of its peers, Stanley still sought to balance the budget. The session lasted sixty days, and the legislature passed {{of many of the}} bills he advocated. The most significant created a three-member state tax commission, chaired by M. M. Logan. Additional taxes were passed on distilled spirits, oil production, race tracks, and corporate licenses. Assessments on the value of property, which had typically been evaluated at one-third to one-half of <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> rose dramatically. To balance this increase, legislators reduced the tax rates on certain types of property. With the dramatic increase in funds yielded by the special session, the General Assembly approved funding increases in nearly every part of state government, including higher education. The State Board of Health was given expanded powers, and county boards of health were established.|$|E

50|$|This {{approach}} to development communication was criticized by Latin American researchers such as Luis Ramiro Beltan and Alfonso Gumucio Dagron, because it emphasized {{problems in the}} developing nation rather than its unequal relation with developed countries.

50|$|FCRs {{are a part}} of the {{statutory}} reporting requirements for life insurance companies in Pakistan, Australia, Ghana and non-life insurance companies in Canada. FCRs are also required in the UK under the Financial Services and Markets Act of 2000 and in Ireland. While many consider FCRs a type of compliance report, they can also be useful for corporate management to identify weaknesses in risk strategy, to test diversification of risk through, e.g., reinsurance, and to set <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>pricing</b> for options.|$|R
5000|$|One {{defender of}} the use of options in Islamic banking is Andreas A. Jobst of the International Monetary Fund, who quotes Mohammed Hashim Kamali who finds “nothing {{inherently}} objectionable" [...] in selling and using options, which like other kinds of trade is mubah (permissible) in fiqh, and [...] "simply an extension of the basic liberty that the Quran has granted”. Jobst argues that using derivatives for risk diversification [...] "contributes to the continuous discovery of the <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> of risk, improves stability {{at all levels of the}} financial system and enhances general welfare." [...] Specifically, issuing stock options to employees is a common way of increasing productivity.|$|E
5000|$|In 2016, the Trust {{attracted}} controversy after selling 63 {{investment properties}} it owned in Walthamstow to a newly formed property investment company, which took steps {{soon after the}} sale to evict some of the established tenants, and re-sold two of the properties in February 2016. Tenants argued that the Trust had failed {{to give them an}} opportunity to purchase the properties they were renting before selling the properties. The Charity Commission subsequently launched an investigation into the sale amid concerns the Trust might have breached obligations to dispose of charity assets for a <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> The Guardian suggested the terms of the sales meant the charity [...] "could have lost more than £3m, or almost twice the total it awarded in charitable grants last year".|$|E
5000|$|During {{the early}} 1880s, the vast {{majority}} of the reservation was licensed for grazing to large cattle outfits in 8 large parcels, at the rate of 2 cents per acre, about a third of the <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price.</b> They were not leases, as a legal lease of reservation land was forbidden by law. Miles, the Indian agent, called a council of chiefs and cattlemen on December 12, 1882 to consider grazing permits, and believed he had obtained the consent of {{the vast majority}} of the representatives of the tribes. There was still strong opposition, particularly among the Cheyenne camped at Cantonment. They killed some cattle for food and also as cultural resistance. The soldier societies began requiring the Cheyenne to participate in medicine ceremonies and punished Cheyenne who farmed or sent their children to school.|$|E

Contrary to statements, Mancheski still controls over 90% of the shares that were distributed.|$|R
50|$|Since its inception, the Baron {{has always}} been {{near the top of}} the light {{airplane}} hierarchy. In 2008 a new Baron costs roughly $1,040,000. As expensive to operate as it is to buy, the 'next step up' from a Baron is a very big one. Faster aircraft, with greater range and more load-carrying capability are generally turbine-powered and far more expensive.

50|$|By 1998, Hershenson's {{customers}} and friends were increasingly suggesting he try selling his merchandise using online auction company eBay. Hershenson was {{skeptical of the}} company's value in selling rare collectibles. eBay became a public corporation in September 1998, and in 1999, Hershenson decided to begin posting some of his items on the auction company's website. Hershenson believed that some eBay sellers sold their vintage collectibles for much more than their <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> due to high fixed prices and less knowledgeable buyers. Unlike these sellers, Hershenson instead began each of his auctions at $2.99, hoping to build a loyal customer base. In the first 6 months he lost money, selling items for much lower than their market value. At the end of 2001, Hershenson had posted his first online major movie poster auction, which grossed $776,000, with each piece selling {{for an average of}} $1,000.|$|E
5000|$|Subsequently, a {{prospector}} {{employed by}} British-based company Manson Consolidated sends mineral samples, acquired from the [...] "Crystal Mountain" [...] {{in the remote}} hinterland of the African republic of Zangaro, to headquarters. When they are analysed, ruthless British mining tycoon Sir James Manson realises {{that there is a}} huge platinum deposit in Zangaro. Despite this, thanks to the president of Zangaro, Jean Kimba, being Marxist, homicidal, insane, and under Soviet influence, any public announcement of the findings would benefit only the Russians. Confiding only in his top assistants, security chief Simon Endean and financial expert Martin Thorpe, Manson plans to depose Kimba and install a puppet leader who, for a pittance, will sign over Zangaro's mining rights to a shell company secretly owned by Manson. When Manson Consolidated eventually acquires the shell company for a <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> Sir James Manson and his aides will pocket £60 million.|$|E
50|$|When first {{published}} the catalogue {{was regarded as}} a considerable expense. There was no set retail price as this was unnecessary for a self-published and privately sold book. The book was sold at the office of the printing house. A full page advertisement on the back cover of the November 1947 issue of The New Light Philatelic Magazine, Vol 14, No. 2 (《新光郵票雜誌》民國三十六年十一月十四卷第二期) listed the retail price of the catalogue as 500,000 yuan in National Currency. To put this price into perspective, the highest bank note denomination in 1947 was a 10,000 yuan note, the magazine where the advertisement appeared was sold for 10,000 yuan a copy, and the price for placing the full page advertisement was 2,400,000 yuan. In other words, if the magazine was sold for $10 a copy, a <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> in 2016, then the catalogue would be worth an equivalent of $500, which was {{considered by many to be}} a substantial amount of money.|$|E

25|$|Producers {{organize}} and strive for Fair Trade certification for several reasons, either through religious ties, wants for social justice, wants for autonomy, political liberalization, or {{simply because they}} want to be paid more for their labor efforts and products. Farmers are more likely to identify with organic farming than Fair Trade farming practices because organic farming is a very visible way that these farmers are different than their neighbors and it actually influences the way they farm. They place a significant importance on natural growing methods. Fair Trade farmers are also more likely to attribute their higher paid prices to the quality of their products rather than <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The Court of Arbitration was {{the first}} court in New South Wales, a state of Australia which dealt {{exclusively}} with industrial relation disputes {{in the early twentieth}} century. Justice Lance Wright claims that it perhaps {{was the first}} court of its type in the world. [...] The court was unique at that time as it was the first court of its type to deal with labour relations between employer and employees on a compulsory basis. [...] Previous arbitration measures between employer and employee had been on a voluntary basis or had been based on the criminal justice system through the use of criminal penalties.The conventional economic model is that both employer and employee enjoy equal bargaining power to set wages and conditions. [...] This asserts that both parties are able to agree on a <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for the cost of labour free from distortions. However, where employers or employees group together, these outcomes can be distorted particularly in “boom” or “bust” economic conditions. The purpose of the court was to change the manner in which employers and employees negotiated pay and conditions. It was an attempt to reduce the power imbalances between employer groups or employee unions that arose from using collective bargaining, and the resulting use of that market power to influence wages, and also to reduce the threat of lockout or strikes to achieve those ends.|$|E

The management of VNK resisted the takeover; it used a technique that was widespread in the late 1990s - making up a fictitious debt for the company, so that VNK appeared to owe somebody $440 million. All the same, YUKOS succeeded in acquiring the controlling interest. It refused to pay the fictitious debt, and transferred the assets of VNK enterprises to offshore zones. When the state, a minority shareholder in VNK, called on YUKOS {{to account for the}} transfer, YUKOS explained that it was a safeguard against attacks on the company by the fictitious creditors. All the enterprises in question were returned to VNK ownership almost a year before the auction at which YUKOS bought out the state's remaining stake in the company - at a <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>price,</b> as the state later acknowledged."Nevertheless, Tomskneft (contrary to its wishes and to common sense) has been declared a victim, the temporary transfer of assets has been defined as theft, and the lawyer who carried out the orders of the company's real owners has been identified as the mastermind of the operation." ...|$|E

40|$|This paper proposes an {{alternative}} approach to the modeling of the interest rate term structure. It suggests that the total <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for risk {{is an important factor}} that has to be modeled carefully. The growth optimal portfolio, which is characterized by this factor, is used as reference unit or benchmark for obtaining a consistent price system. Benchmarked derivative prices are taken as conditional expectations of future benchmarked prices under the real world probability measure. The inverse of the squared total <b>market</b> <b>price</b> for risk is modeled as a square root process and shown to influence the medium and long term forward rates. With constant parameters and constant short rate the model already generates a hump shaped mean for the forward rate curve and other empirical features typically observed.

40|$|During the 1990 s, {{concerns}} that nonprofit (NP) hospitals were being sold at below-market prices to investor-owned (IO) chains helped to prompt the widespread adoption of state laws regulating {{the sale and}} conversion of nonprofits. In this paper we provide tests of under-pricing, {{both before and after}} state laws were adopted. Because NP CEOs and boards do not share in the sale proceeds, it may appear that they lack incentives to negotiate vigorously for <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices.</b> However, incremental sale proceeds can be used to fund community benefits such as charitable foundations, which are also valued by CEOs and boards. In our empirical section, we use abnormal returns {{at the time of the}} acquisition to measure the extent of under-pricing. Absent regulation, IO chains did not earn abnormal returns from their acquisitions of NPs and benefited more by transacting with other IO and privately-owned hospitals. In states that subsequently adopted regulations, acquisition activity slowed significantly and acquirer returns became negative...|$|R

2500|$|According to an {{investigation}} of USIA business in 1946–1955, 20% of its products were traded and consumed within USIA, 38% sold to Eastern Europe, 42% sold to non-USIA Austrian customers, and only 1% to Western European customers. The United States suppressed USIA operations through a [...] "neutralization plan" [...] devised in 1947. An embargo imposed by the United States on exports behind the Iron Curtain prohibited other Austrian businesses from selling their products to USIA, unless it guaranteed that the finished products will stay in Austria. Dealing with USIA, when allowed by the West, was problematic because valid legal title could not be enforced. Vienna City Hall informally banned municipal purchases of USIA products. Marshall Plan money was deliberately deployed against USIA interests. Despite these problems USIA had a crucial and unfair competitive advantage. It was exempt of Austrian customs and foreign trade regulations. It routinely disregarded and evaded Austrian taxes and its trucking arm engaged in outright smuggling. USIA products easily moved across the Iron Curtain, and could be sold at a profit and below <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>prices</b> inside Austria.

40|$|Step {{therapy was}} first {{introduced}} by managed care organizations in the 1980 s {{as an attempt to}} control the costs of prescription drugs (1). Step therapy is also known as step protocol, fail first policy, sequencing, or tiering. The increasing cost of prescription drugs has led managed care organizations and their pharmacy benefits managers to limit their formulary. Under the step therapy programs, the patient is generally required to fail one or more formulary covered drug before allowing the non-formulary (or non-preferred) agent to be used. Frequently, the non-preferred drug is a more expensive medication. The cost of the drug may be based on <b>fair</b> <b>market</b> <b>pricing</b> of the medication or may be based on negotiated pricing between the manufacturer and pharmacy board. Presently, the privately contracted <b>pricing,</b> rather than <b>market</b> cost, on biologics therapies for rheumatic conditions drive step therapy decisions. Often, higher copays for non-preferred drugs are applied to discourage their use which leads to tiering of drugs within a similar class. This specialty tiering (such as Tier 4 or higher) places crucial treatments out of reach for the patient.
