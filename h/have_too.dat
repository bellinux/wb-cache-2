5|$|On Wednesday, 15 March 2006, the United Nations General Assembly voted {{overwhelmingly}} {{in favour}} of establishing a new United Nations Human Rights Council, the successor to the United Nations Commission on Human Rights, with the resolution receiving approval from 170 members of the 191-nation Assembly. Only the United States, the Marshall Islands, Palau, and Israel voted against the Council's creation, claiming that it would <b>have</b> <b>too</b> little power {{and that there were}} insufficient safeguards to prevent human rights-abusing nations from taking control.|$|E
5|$|The Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works {{locomotive}} acquired {{along with}} them could not be restored. Built in 1902, this locomotive was {{the oldest of the}} five locomotives purchased and was determined to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> many problems to be rebuilt. It was stored out of use in California for a period before being sold to an unknown locomotive broker. Some of its parts were used to help restore the four Baldwin locomotives, including its smokestack, which was fitted to the WDWRR's No. 4 locomotive.|$|E

5|$|The {{secondary}} battery consisted of twelve 6-inch (15.2cm) Mk VII guns mounted in casemates in the hull around the forward superstructure. These guns were chosen because the 4-inch (10.2cm) guns on earlier battleships were {{deemed to be}} too weak and <b>have</b> <b>too</b> short a range to effectively combat torpedo boats with newer, more powerful torpedoes. Admiral Jackie Fisher had opposed the idea of increasing the {{secondary battery}}, though {{he retired from the}} post of First Sea Lord in 1910. As a result, the Iron Dukes, which were designed in 1911, received the larger 6inch gun.|$|E
5|$|After 7.Nc3 Black has the zwischenzug 7...Qh4+ 8.g3 Bxc3+ 9.bxc3 Qe7 so {{that the}} {{diagonal}} a8–h1 is weakened before Black develops the Bc8 to the b7-square. The queen on the e7-square is well placed to pressure the e4-pawn. However, as most of Black's pieces are on the queenside, continuing with pawn pushes like f7–f5 is probably too weakening, as Alekhine demonstrated in his game against Seitz in 1925. So Black does best to attack with pieces, possibly with the setup b6/Nc5/Bb7/0-0-0. In that case Tseitlin considers that with a knight on c5 the move d7–d6 should be avoided if Black has {{to respond to the}} capture Bxc5 by dxc5, because the white pawns in e4 and f4 would <b>have</b> <b>too</b> much leeway.|$|E
5|$|Braathens SAFE started {{test flights}} on 14 March 1956, with the service taking 20 minutes from Oslo Airport, Fornebu. The {{scheduled}} service was inaugurated on 21 May as {{a stop on}} Braathens SAFE's route between Oslo and Stavanger Airport, Sola. Passengers could travel twice each day to both airports, with tickets costing NOK30. The service was seasonal and only flown during the summer half of the year. Notodden Airport proved to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> few passengers, resulting in the route being terminated {{after the end of}} the 1958 season. The last season, the service was operated by Thor Solberg on contract with Braathens SAFE. From 1959, Solberg started with a two-month service with six weekly round trips to Fornebu, after securing a NOK5,000 guarantee from the municipality to cover any losses. The route was abandoned after the single season.|$|E
60|$|That {{interview}} {{was a dangerous}} experiment, and she suffered for it.

5000|$|Queuing {{problems}} are usually due {{to too many}} servers or too little servers. Although <b>having</b> <b>too</b> many servers cause rapid service, workers become idle and equipment becomes under-utilized. On the other hand, <b>having</b> <b>too</b> little servers creates long queues, frustrates customers, and congests areas. Thus, correct and balanced queue management is necessary.|$|R
50|$|An {{eye that}} <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much {{or too little}} {{refractive}} power to focus light onto the retina has a refractive error. A myopic eye <b>has</b> <b>too</b> much power so light is focused in front of the retina. Conversely, a hyperopic eye <b>has</b> <b>too</b> little power so when the eye is relaxed, light is focused behind the retina. An eye with a refractive power in one meridian that is different from the refractive power of the other meridians has astigmatism. Anisometropia is the condition in which one eye has a different refractive power than the other eye.|$|R
5|$|In Pasadena, {{high school}} {{students}} Costa and J.B. plan to throw a party for their friend Thomas' birthday, aiming to increase their popularity. Thomas' parents go away for the weekend, leaving him alone in the house, but warn him not to <b>have</b> <b>too</b> many people over, and not to drive his father's Mercedes. Thomas is reluctant to have the party at his house, but Costa continues with his plan. Costa hires AV-student Dax to chronicle the night's events. Costa and J.B. advertise the party throughout the school. Thomas himself invites Alexis, the hottest girl at school, and his best friend Kirby, who has a crush on Thomas.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to fighting, the player {{can choose to}} talk to demons encountered on the field, and attempt to recruit them to their party; {{the success of this}} depends on the player's level, with more powerful demons only being recruitable if the player's level is sufficiently high. In Ronde, the player does not initiate these conversations themselves, however: instead, defeated demons sometimes choose to talk to the player, and sometimes decide to join their party. Like in other Megami Tensei games, the player can fuse multiple allied demons with each other, thereby creating more powerful demons. In Ronde, the player can form contracts with demons, allowing human characters to use demon magic. Demons are fueled by magnetite, so the player needs to manage the supply of this, and thus cannot <b>have</b> <b>too</b> many allied demons on the field at once or take too long to finish a battle. By clearing battles, the player can advance to the next chapter. The games' stories are affected by player choices, and have multiple endings.|$|E
5|$|With {{only one}} {{significant}} opencast {{in the local}} area mining past 2008, along with another smaller opencast at Stony Heap, {{there is a need}} for more local supplies of coal for the station because of the risks in depending upon overseas sources of coal. Long distance supplies of coal can see sharp fluctuations in price, as well as the flexibility and security of the supply, whereas local sources aren't as vulnerable to interruptions and have fixed, contracted prices. The station is not an established importer of coal, having only imported since 2005. It is situated a long way from the major coal unloading ports of Teesside, Hull and Immingham, which have been booked by power stations closer to them. This means that coal for the power station needs to be imported via Blyth or the Port of Tyne. However, because of the small sizes of these docks, they can only receive ships from Poland and Russia. Due to high production costs and industry restructuring in Poland though, the only realistic source of imported coal for the station is Russia. The environmental impact of shipping 1,000,000 tonnes of coal from Russia to Lynemouth is the production of 12,812 tonnes of CO2, whereas hauling coal from local mines to the station would produce only 703 tonnes of CO2. There are currently two local opencast mines for which planning approval have been granted, one at Shotton near Cramlington approved in 2007, the other at Potland Burn near Ashington approved in October 2008. However, the coal mined from Potland Burn would <b>have</b> <b>too</b> high a sulphur content to meet the station's environmental requirements, meaning it wouldn't be an immediate choice of coal for the station. Coal had been provided by the Delhi surface mine at Blagdon, owned by Banks Developments, since 2002. It finished extracting coal in March 2009, following the permission of extension proposals to its original plans in May 2007.|$|E
