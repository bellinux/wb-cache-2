40|$|Abstract Based on dynamic direct tensile tests, {{splitting}} {{tests and}} spalling tests, {{it is found}} that the experimental tensile strength of concrete-like materials greatly increases with loading-rate. This kind of dynamic tensile strength enhancement may be caused by the combination influence of the inertia effect, real rate effect and end <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> (here the end <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> is only existed in splitting and spalling tests). To further investigate the influence degree of real rate effect for concrete-like materials in dynamic tensile tests, this paper conducts systematically dynamic tensile experiments, viz. dynamic direct tensile tests, splitting tests and spalling tests. At the same time, numerical dynamic tensile tests are employed to analyze the mechanical characteristics of concrete-like materials. A hydrostatic pressure dependent model, the Drucker-Prager constitutive model, is used for concrete-like material specimens, which can consider the influence of inertia effect. In the numerical model, the specimen is set to be rate-independent, thus the predicted dynamic tensile strength of specimens is free of the real rate effect. The end <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> is also taken into account in the numerical analysis of dynamic splitting and spalling tests. It is found that the dynamic tensile strength of concrete-like materials in numerical simulations does not varies obviously with the loading-rate, indicating that the inertia effect and end <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> have little contributions to the dynamic tensile strength enhancement of concrete-like materials. Therefore, the real rate effect dominates the dynamic tensile strength enhancement of concrete-like materials in laboratory tests, but the inertia effect and end <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> do not...|$|E

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of block {{ownership}} on the firm’s trading activity and secondary-market liquidity. Our empirical results show that block ownership takes potential trading activity off the table relative to a diffuse ownership structure and impairs the firm’s market liquidity. These adverse liquidity effects disappear, however, once we control for trad-ing activity. Our findings suggest that block ownership is detrimental to the firm’s market liquidity because of its adverse impact on trading activity—a real <b>friction</b> <b>effect.</b> After controlling for this real <b>friction</b> <b>effect,</b> we find little evidence that block ownership has a negative impact on informational friction.

40|$|Abstract—Modeling and {{compensation}} for <b>friction</b> <b>effects</b> {{has been a}} topic of considerable mainstream interest in motion control research. This interest is spawned {{from the fact that}} modeling nonlinear <b>friction</b> <b>effects</b> is a theoretically challenging problem, and compensating for the <b>effects</b> of <b>friction</b> in a controller has practical ramifications. If the <b>friction</b> <b>effects</b> in the system can be accurately modeled, there is an improved potential to de-sign controllers that can cancel the effects; whereas, excessive steady-state tracking errors, oscillations, and limit cycles can result from controllers that do not accurately compensate for friction. A tracking controller is developed in this paper for a general Euler–Lagrange system that contains a new continuously differentiable friction model with uncertain nonlinear parameterizable terms. To achieve the semi-global asymptotic tracking re-sult, a recently developed integral feedback compensation strategy is used to identify the <b>friction</b> <b>effects</b> online, assuming exact model knowledge of the remaining dynamics. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to conclude the tracking and friction identification results. Experimental results illustrate the tracking and friction identification performance of the developed controller. Index Terms—Friction, Lyapunov methods, nonlinear systems, uncertain systems.

In this work, the <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> at the surface and the deformation heterogeneity in the ECAPed aluminum alloy 6061 -T 6 were characterized. X-Ray diffraction was used to determine residual stresses (RS) on the sample surface. The volumetric sections were characterized by Synchrotron diffraction at ESRF beamline ID 15 B (Grenoble, France). It was found that the microhardness mapping and residual stress results showed a good agreement with the finite element analysis for the first layer studied. Minor strain variation, Delta d/d as a function of (hkl) planes, for the different analyzed sections was found. The study also showed that there was an incomplete symmetry in the residual stress near the surface, even at up to a depth of 400 gm. The regions with higher deformation were found to be at the top and bottom parts of the sample, while the central region showed stress variations of up to 50 MPa. (C) 2016 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|In this {{research}} the bed <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> is estimated {{of a river}} estuary by use of hydrodynamic analysis. The on-site sampled data of the Wu River estuary {{is applied to the}} analysis. There are many dynamic factors that affect the flow characteristics in the estuary. The effect of tide on the generation of tidal current, bottom friction and geometry effect is the focus of this paper. The Wu River estuary is about 15 km in length, with a small bottom slope and no physical obstruction; thus the incident wave at the estuary is considered a progressive wave with damping effect. The amplitude reduction and phase shift of the incident wave are analyzed. By the analysis of celerity reduction factor of the estuary, the estimated value of mean resistance coefficient M (mu, kappa), damping modulus mu, and wave number kappa gathered from on-site observations are applied for validation. Finally, Manning's coefficient for each section of the observation stations can be determined. It is found that the value of Manning's coefficient is small downstream and increases towards upstream, and that the bed <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> of an estuary varies largely. The estimated results of the paper are compared with the empirical formulas and the modified solution for practical application is discussed...|$|E

The theory developed in this book approaches this problem bottom-up, by deriving the behavior of macroscopic friction surfaces from the microscopic surface physics. The model is based on two assumptions: First, rough surfaces are inherently fractal, exhibiting roughness {{on a wide range of}} scales. Second, transient <b>friction</b> <b>effects</b> are caused by creep enlargement of the real area of contact between two bodies. This work demonstrates the results of extensive Finite Element analyses of the creep behavior of surface asperities, and proposes a generalized multi-scale area iteration for calculating the time-dependent real contact between two bodies.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{accurately}} predict the varying of formwork pressure over time, {{it is necessary}} to consider various factors influencing the development of formwork pressure. A prediction model has been previously proposed, but that model has some limitations in that only intrinsic material characteristics are taken into account. Extrinsic effects such as wall friction, formwork flexibility, and external temperature are excluded in the model. This study focuses on the wall <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> as one of the extrinsic factors. First, by incorporating the intrinsic model and friction stress acting on the interface, a method of calculating formwork pressure considering the wall <b>friction</b> <b>effect</b> is suggested. To find out how much friction stress is acting on the interface and how it varies over time, formwork pressure tests were performed with circular column formworks having three different diameters. In these columns, the vertical pressure at the bottom and the lateral pressures were measured. To calibrate parameters of the intrinsic model for the same material as that used in the formwork pressure tests, additional tests were conducted with a specially designed apparatus that can exclude effects of extrinsic factors. From tests and analysis results, it was found that wall friction greatly affects the variation of formwork pressure over time. The newly suggested calculation method can give a good prediction of real formwork pressure. close 5...|$|E
