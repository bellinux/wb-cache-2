25|$|The fourth {{series was}} aired during 2010, between 17 April to 5 June; a single episode of this series, {{intended}} for airing on 22 May, was pushed back to 23 May, {{in order to}} avoid it clashing with live coverage of the UEFA Champions League Final that year. The auditions were once more held across the same five cities as before, though the series also held auditions with Newcastle upon Tyne; the city had been originally planned to hold auditions for the previous series, but these were cancelled before this could happen. Owing to illness, Cowell was unable to attend the Birmingham auditions, which led to Louis Walsh being in brought in as a guest judge for these. The series was won by gymnastic troupe Spelbound, with dancing <b>duo</b> <b>Twist</b> and Pulse coming in second, and drummer Kieran Gaffney placing third.|$|E

5000|$|In 2013, Brodkin again {{returned}} as Nelson in Heat 3 of Let's Dance for Comic Relief on BBC One, dancing with street dance <b>duo</b> <b>Twist</b> and Pulse. He won the [...] "judges' vote", thus performing {{again in the}} final. However, he did not win. His actual final position is unknown as the unsuccessful finalists were called in [...] "no specific order".|$|E
2500|$|In 2008, HouseGuests Eric Stein and Jessica Hughbanks {{returned}} {{to host a}} Head of Household competition for Big Brother 9. During that same season, HouseGuest Dick Donato {{returned to}} host a Power of Veto competition. That same year, HouseGuest Jen Johnson participated in a food competition for Big Brother 10 celebrating ten seasons of the series. Jessica was later a potential HouseGuest for Big Brother 11, however, her [...] "clique" [...] failed to win Head of Household thus she was not granted access into the game. In 2011, HouseGuests Dick and Daniele Donato returned to compete on Big Brother 13 {{as part of the}} Dynamic <b>Duos</b> <b>twist.</b> In the first week, however, Dick chose to walk from the game due to personal issues; Daniele came in 8th place.|$|R
50|$|Two {{years after}} her initial appearance, Jordan {{returned}} to the house for the thirteenth season of the show, again with Jeff, as part of the <b>duos</b> <b>twist.</b> In the first week, Jordan joined an alliance of the six returning players, consisting of herself and Jeff, father and daughter Dick and Daniele Donato, and fellow couple Brendon Villegas and Rachel Reilly, and following Dick's unexpected departure, was pivotal in securing the key votes of Shelly Moore and Kalia Booker in the Veteran's successful attempt to save Porsche Briggs and evict her partner, Keith Henderson. Jordan continued to prove her worth by winning the second Head of Household competition, and opted to target the popular Dominic Briones, nominating him alongside Adam Poch. However, when Dominic used the veto on the pair, Jordan was forced to nominate a replacement pair, and under pressure from her alliance, she reluctantly nominated Shelly and Cassi Colvin for eviction, resulting in Cassi's unanimous eviction. After surviving eviction, Shelly pledged her loyalty to Jeff and Jordan, agreeing to go to the final three with them.|$|R
50|$|During week 8, a {{controversial}} Pandora's Box twist left fans wondering if production was fixing {{the game for}} certain players. As Head of Household for the week, Porsche Briggs openly stated she was going after the last two returning HouseGuests, Jordan Lloyd and Rachel Reilly. But when Porsche opened Pandora's Box, she unleashed {{the return of the}} <b>duos</b> <b>twist,</b> which made both Jordan and Rachel a duo. If one of them were to win the Power of Veto, they would both be removed from the block and safe from eviction. Fans became highly suspicious as to whether this was a plot by production to keep both women in the game, as the remaining HouseGuests had made a contingency plan to vote out whichever veteran did not win the Power of Veto prior to the twist. These questions only heightened after the competition for the Power of Veto was merely a redux of an earlier Head of Household competition that Reilly had won earlier in the season. Rachel would go on to win the veto competition, saving herself and Jordan while forcing Porsche to nominate Adam Poch and Shelly Moore by default, as they were the only pair left for Porsche to put on the block. Rachel would later go on to win the season while Porsche finished in 2nd place, and Jordan finished in 4th.|$|R
5000|$|Following Danielle and Jeff's eviction, Porsche won Week 8's HoH competition, Snake-Eyes, and {{nominated}} the {{two remaining}} veterans, Jordan and Rachel, for eviction. As HoH, Porsche decided to open Pandora's Box (PB), and was awarded $10,000 {{that she had to}} split with one other player. She chose Kalia. The other part of Pandora's Box was the return of the <b>Duo</b> <b>Twist</b> for Week 8 only. Porsche chose Kalia, Rachel chose Jordan, and Adam chose Shelly. Rachel won the Duo Do Over PoV competition, and removed Jordan and herself from the block. Porsche was left with one alternative duo - Adam & Shelly. Shelly was evicted by a 2-1 vote, making her the fourth member of the Jury, and the first newbie on the Jury.|$|E

Announced on the StarKid YouTube page on January 1, 2016, Firebringer is StarKids first female-led show, {{with a book}} by Nick Lang, Matt Lang, and Brian Holden {{and music}} and lyrics by Meredith Stepien and Mark Swiderski.

2500|$|A line {{spoken by}} Robin (Chris O'Donnell) in Batman Forever is a {{homage to the}} {{television}} Robin's catch-phrase exclamations that started [...] "Holy" [...] and sometimes ended [...] "Batman!" [...] - for instance [...] "Holy bargain basements, Batman!" [...] (from the television series' first season) and [...] "Holy flypaper, Batman!" [...] (from the television series' second season). During the movie, Robin says [...] "Holy rusted metal, Batman!" [...] after the <b>duo</b> climbs onto <b>twisted</b> metal girders beside some water. This catchphrase also appeared {{for a time in}} Batman comic books.|$|R
50|$|Despite {{the votes}} being locked to evict Daniele, Shelly {{began to have}} doubts about her {{alliance}} with Jeff and Jordan, and actively began campaigning to save Daniele, upsetting Jeff who engaged in an argument with Shelly shortly before the live show. The houseguest's learned it was Fast-Forward eviction night, and after Daniele was evicted, Kalia became the new Head of Household and nominated Jeff and Rachel for eviction. Jeff was unable to win the veto, and Shelly voted to evict Jeff, forcing a tie, which Kalia broke in Rachel's favor, resulting in Jeff's eviction. Jordan furiously declared {{the end of her}} friendship with Shelly, losing her temper in a rare moment of anger. With Porsche now in power, Rachel and Jordan felt doomed, but were given a chance of reprieve when Porsche opened Pandora's Box, re-activating the <b>Duos</b> <b>twist</b> for one week. Jordan paired up with Rachel, and despite initially being nominated as a pair, Rachel won the Veto, and used it on herself and Jordan, essentially giving them the choice of who to evict from the two replacement nominees - Adam and Shelly. One week after Jeff's eviction, Jordan and Rachel chose to take revenge on Shelly, evicting her in a 2-1 vote. Rachel then proceeded to win the next Head of Household competition, and despite Adam having the ability to use his Veto to put Jordan in a position of certain eviction, he chose to maintain his long-standing alliance with Jordan, pushing her into the final four. Wanting to keep her early deal with nominated houseguest Kalia, Jordan voted to evict Porsche on eviction night, aware that Rachel would break the resultant tie and evict Kalia anyway. The following week, Jordan narrowly lost the power position to Adam by a single point, and lost the Veto to Porsche, who also gained the sole power to choose who to evict of Jordan and Rachel. Jordan's choice to vote to evict Porsche two days previously came back to haunt her, and she was evicted from the game for the first time, after 69 days in the house. Jordan voted for Rachel to win Big Brother 13.|$|R
500|$|Sara D. Anderson of AOL Radio Blog said, [...] "the <b>duo's</b> {{beautiful}} voices <b>twist</b> and soar around Drake's supple and soulful vocals". Although she {{commented that}} Drake's voice was [...] "almost unrecognizable" [...] on the track, Becky Bain of Idolator noted [...] "how sweetly he comes off in this sensitive track". Bain also complimented Drake's {{part in the}} song, stating, [...] "Drizzy kills it in his mellow verse in the middle, his raspy monotone fitting in quite well with the melancholy vibe of the song." [...] A writer for Birthplace Magazine said the song was mixed with [...] "a combination of slick production, strong vocals from Dirty Money songstresses Dawn and Kaleena, a guest appearance by Drake, and hype as only Diddy can deliver", and called the song and video [...] "mainstream guilty pleasures we can enjoy" ...|$|R
5000|$|One year later, Reilly and Villegas (by now her fiance) {{returned}} to Big Brother for its thirteenth season, {{as part of}} a [...] "Returning Duos" [...] twist. Reilly claimed she was returning to the show in a bid to redeem herself following her previous appearance. Reilly and Villegas quickly forged an alliance with the four other returning players, father and daughter, Dick and Daniele Donato of Big Brother 8 and fellow couple, Jordan Lloyd and Jeff Schroeder of Big Brother 11, as well as a side alliance with Porsche Briggs. The alliance - known as [...] "the Veterans" [...] dominated the house in the early weeks, with Reilly winning Head of Household (HoH) in the first and third weeks, as well as the Power of Veto in a two-person challenge with Villegas in the first week. The alliance fell apart in the second of Reilly's HoH weeks, when Daniele was caught in her attempts to turn the two couples against each other. However, Daniele then proceeded to win the next HoH competition, nominating Reilly and Villegas against each other, sparking a long-running feud between the two women. After winning the Power of Veto, Villegas decided to use it on Reilly, effectively ensuring his own eviction. Reilly was nominated again the following week, but was spared when confusion about an upcoming twist caused Lawon Exum to volunteer to be evicted in her place, in the mistaken belief that it would give him an advantage in the game. In reality, the evicted player and the winner of an America's Choice vote would compete to return, with Villegas winning the vote and then beating Exum in the subsequent competition, regaining his place in the game. His stay was short lived however, as he was evicted at the hands of Donato once again a week later. Reilly took revenge the following week, evicting Daniele after finding herself as the swing-vote. After narrowly surviving an eviction vote 3-2 against Schroeder, Reilly paired with Lloyd when the <b>duos</b> <b>twist</b> briefly returned, and won a key Veto competition that kept them both in the game at the expense of Shelly Moore. Reilly then followed up by winning HoH for the third time, resulting in the eviction of Kalia Booker. After failing to win the final Veto competition, Reilly reformed her early alliance with Briggs, and the pair worked together to make the final two, with Briggs evicting Lloyd in the final four stage, and then Reilly evicting Adam Poch the following week after she won HoH for the fourth time. Reilly eventually was named as the winner of Big Brother 13 in a vote of 4-3 over Briggs, earning the jury votes of Brendon Villegas, Jeff Schroeder, Jordan Lloyd and Shelly Moore, and losing the votes of Daniele Donato, Kalia Booker and Adam Poch. Reilly won $500,000 for winning the show.|$|R
5000|$|Pustra/Vile-een's Vaudeville was {{an unusual}} comedy duo that {{performed}} on the Alternative Cabaret and Neo-Burlesque scene in London, England and abroad from 2006 till 2009. With their trademark comedy and unusually strange stage acts, they quickly established themselves as a refreshing, subversive and highly talented <b>duo</b> with a <b>twist</b> of Sideshow, known for performing with pancake make-up and in their underwear. The duo {{was a product of}} the MySpace era and they created their act online, inspired by Silent films and slapstick comedy of the early 1900s - 1930s and continued to use Social Media to reach more and more fans. Featured in Time Out Magazine's [...] Creatures of The Night article and a press shoot at the famous Hackney Empire alongside other established and emerging acts, the colorful duo was thrust into the spotlight. Noted appearances include Electric Picnic 2008 and the show Telling Tales (Too Terrible To Tell) ...|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "My SportsCenter" [...] {{game for}} this evening was co-anchoring, {{although}} it was individuals being cut, not <b>duos.</b> The <b>twist</b> here {{was at the end}} of their segment, after a couple of highlight readings and a news story, the pairs would interview a player from a Major League Baseball team. Hawrylko and Horowitz were the first pair to go, and their interviewee was New York Yankees outfielder Gary Sheffield. Horowitz' interview skills were praised, while Hawrylko was said to have needed more work. As a team, Paige said they were good, but needed to display more chemistry. Ashworth and Startare were next to go, and they conducted their interview with Chicago Cubs pitcher Kent Mercker. Startare got praise for much-needed improvement from episode one. Ashworth was criticized for not asking questions that pertained to the current situation, and for asking questions that were too long. Wendy's Wild Card winners Holmes and James were next, and their interviewee was Justin Morneau of the Minnesota Twins. Their lack of chemistry and their interviewing skills were both criticized. Said Paige, [...] "Guys, call your mamas, and tell them to keep the front porch light on. If you don't get better than that, you'll be home soon", a message for both of them, drawing a [...] "Wowza!" [...] from Hoover. Holmes was said to be the better of the two. Following Holmes and James was the debut of a new segment featuring real SportsCenter anchors giving advice to the remaining contestants, titled [...] "U.S. Air Force Wingman." [...] The person giving the advice-the first Dream Job winner, Mike Hall. Hall told them [...] "less is more." [...] "Not every play needs a joke, not every highlight needs style, but every highlight does need information", he said. After the commercial break following Hall's [...] "SportsCenter 101", it was time for Shroff and Scott to show what they could do. Their interviewee was Los Angeles Dodgers pitcher José Lima. A problem arose at the start of the interview, when Scott asked Lima, [...] "Can you hear me?" [...] (He could.) Jaffe said some of the teamwork seemed forced, that it was mediocre. Paige said the interview was embarrassing for both of them because of how it started, and that Shroff wasn't as good as he was in week one. Smith said Scott was better than she was in week two, and agreed with Paige that Shroff had slipped from the first week. The last pair was Thompson and Bell, whose interviewee was Houston Astros catcher Brad Ausmus. Their chemistry was praised, and Bell was praised for telling the viewers at home who they would be interviewing him before the [...] "show" [...] started, something that no other contestant did that night.|$|R
