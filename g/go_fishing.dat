5|$|Girl Pat left Grimsby on 1 April 1936. According to Stone's later account, {{when they}} entered the open sea, Orsborne {{assembled}} the crew—except for Jefferson—in the wheelhouse {{and told them that}} this would not be a normal fishing trip. Instead, he proposed to take the boat south, first calling at Dover where he would get rid of Jefferson, who was not included in his further plans. At this stage Orsborne was apparently undecided as to his longer-term intentions, but indicated that they would be sailing into southern waters and might <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> for pearls.|$|E
5|$|Bart and Lisa <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> {{downstream}} of the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant, and Springfield Shopper reporter Dave Shutton {{pulls up}} just as Bart catches a three-eyed fish, much to both the kids' and Shutton's surprise. The fish, nicknamed Blinky by the media, makes headlines around the state, and incumbent governor Mary Bailey calls in a government inspection team to investigate nuclear waste coming from the plant that could have caused the fish to mutate. After the inspection, the plant's owner, Mr. Burns, is presented {{with a list of}} 342 violations, which would cost $56 million to rectify. Distraught, Mr. Burns talks to plant employee Homer, who half-heartedly suggests Mr. Burns run for governor against Bailey so that he could change the standards and prevent the plant from being shut down. Mr. Burns instantly pounces on the idea.|$|E
5|$|Maurice Richard, {{inducted}} in 1961, and Jean Beliveau, inducted in 1972, {{are two of}} ten {{players for}} whom the selection committee has waived the otherwise-mandatory three-year waiting period before being eligible for induction. Defenceman Doug Harvey was unanimously elected in 1973, one year after being denied entry due to his drinking habits. Angered by the snub, Harvey refused his induction, stating {{that he planned to}} <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> instead of attending the induction ceremony. Guy Lafleur was one of three players in NHL history (along with Gordie Howe and Mario Lemieux) to return to playing after being elected. Lafleur, who had first retired in 1984 after growing frustrated with the Canadiens' defence-focused system, returned to the league days after his 1988 election, playing for the New York Rangers and Quebec Nordiques before finally retiring in 1991.|$|E

5|$|So, after Thor secures his goats at Egil's home, Thor and Týr go to Hymir's hall {{in search}} of a {{cauldron}} large enough to brew ale for them all. They arrive, and Týr sees his nine-hundred-headed grandmother and his gold-clad mother, the latter of which welcomes them with a horn. After Hymir—who is not happy to see Thor—comes in from the cold outdoors, Týr's mother helps them find a properly strong cauldron. Thor eats a big meal of two oxen (all the rest eat but one), and then goes to sleep. In the morning, he awakes and informs Hymir that he wants to <b>go</b> <b>fishing</b> the following evening, and that he will catch plenty of food, but that he needs bait. Hymir tells him to go get some bait from his pasture, which he expects should not be a problem for Thor. Thor goes out, finds Hymir's best ox, and rips its head off.|$|E
