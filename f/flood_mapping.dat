Public Awareness of Flood Risk: the Role of the Environment Agency <b>Flood</b> <b>Map,</b> 2006 - 2007 aims to investigate how 'official' information translates into public understanding and action, using {{the example of the}} Environment Agency's (EA) <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> web site. The study has two different elements; a web survey and <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> experiments. The web survey was delivered on-line from the EA servers, with a portal on the <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> site. Users of the EA web page were asked to complete the survey which resulted in 1, 395 valid responses. Questions were asked about the EA website and in particular the <b>flood</b> <b>map.</b> The <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> experiments were in-depth interviews with 51 respondents from specially selected case study areas which had different degrees of flood experience. Individuals were asked to work through online <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> material and their responses to specific questions were recorded. The case study areas where: Brockenhurst, Hampshire (9 participants - inland river flooding/moderate risk); Hambeldon, Hampshire (11 participants – recent groundwater flooding/high risk), Carlisle, Cumbria (13 participants – recent inland river flooding/high risk), and a control population of university environmental management students representing highly informed users with low current risk - Portsmouth University (18 participants).

During the 10 years from fiscal year 1992 through fiscal year 2001, flooding resulted in approximately $ 55 billion in damages. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) is responsible for managing the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP). The program uses <b>flood</b> <b>maps</b> to identify the areas at greatest risk of flooding and make insurance available to property owners {{to protect themselves from}} flood losses. According to FEMA, many of the nation's <b>flood</b> <b>maps</b> are more than 10 years old and no longer reflect current flood hazard risks because of erosion and changes in drainage patterns. Moreover, because many <b>flood</b> <b>maps</b> were created or last updated, there have been improvements in the techniques for assessing and displaying flood risks.

40|$|Remote sensing {{plays an}} {{important}} role in <b>flood</b> <b>mapping</b> and is helping advance flood monitoring and management. Multi-scale <b>flood</b> <b>mapping</b> is necessary for dividing floods into several stages for comprehensive management. However, existing data systems are typically heterogeneous owing to the use of different access protocols and archiving metadata models. In this paper, we proposed a sharable and efficient metadata model (APEOPM) for constructing an Earth observation (EO) data system to retrieve remote sensing data for <b>flood</b> <b>mapping.</b> The proposed model contains two sub-models, an access protocol model and an enhanced encoding model. The access protocol model helps unify heterogeneous access protocols and can achieve intelligent access via a semantic enhancement method. The enhanced encoding model helps unify a heterogeneous archiving metadata model.

Even when a flooding disaster occurs, the communities? fear of another strike decreases over time along with its preparedness. For instance, on June 12, 2008, the city of Fond du Lac, Wisconsin, was blindsided by a major flood because many never knew that their residence was located in a flood-prone area. Most city roads were reported to be underwater and in some places bridges were even submerged by the Fond du Lac River. A lot of the damage was so severe that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) awarded Fond du Lac more than $ 1. 2 million to assist with repairs of homes and the city. As with the case of Fond du Lac, <b>mapping</b> <b>flood</b> prone areas can prepare potential victims and enforce local floodplain management policies. To accomplish this, FEMA launched the Map Modernization project, which aims to update the nation's <b>flood</b> <b>maps.</b> However, the agency is not able to do this alone and has decided to partner with local agencies to produce more accurate <b>flood</b> <b>maps.</b> Therefore, this project investigated the possibility of <b>mapping</b> urban <b>flood</b> areas from amateur aerial photographs and compared the resulting <b>flood</b> <b>map</b> to the most recent FEMA maps of the study area.
