Water mist based techniques are becoming popular but the fire extinguishment products call for high initial investment. There exists a need to develop cost effective water mist generation techniques appropriate for fire suppression. A standard portable water-CO 2 fire <b>extinguisher</b> <b>nozzle</b> is selected for study with an application density of 1. 0 l/min/m 2. A multi-jet nozzle with opposed jet configuration is developed to get improved spray characteristics. Droplet Sauter Mean Diameters (SMD) were empirically calculated using correlations available in the literature. The spray developed has resulted in droplets with SMD {{in the range of}} 0. 3 â€“ 0. 4 mm as calculated from correlations and confirmed using experimental measurements...|$|E

That is to say, devices which will send out a spray of liquid and liquid vapour at a fixed or variable rate and over a desired distance. Preferably {{there is a need for}} a spray of liquid and liquid vapour to occur at a fast rate and over a great distance. In such systems the term "throw ratio" is often referred to as a characteristic of a spray. The throw ratio of material is defined as the distance travelled divided by the length of a chamber from which the spray is ejected. This invention uses vapour explosion technology to dramatically increase the throw ratio, and hence to give a much greater capability for an existing fire <b>extinguisher</b> <b>nozzle...</b>|$|E

Today, nitrate film projection is normally highly regulated and requires extensive precautionary measures including extra projectionist health and safety training. Projectors certified to run nitrate films have many precautions, among them the chambering of the feed and takeup reels in thick metal covers with small slits to allow the film to run through. The projector is modified to accommodate several fire <b>extinguishers</b> with <b>nozzles</b> aimed at the film gate. The extinguishers automatically trigger if a piece of flammable fabric placed near the gate starts to burn. While this triggering would likely damage or destroy {{a significant portion of the}} projection components, it would prevent a fire which could cause far greater damage. Projection rooms may be required to have automatic metal covers for the projection windows, preventing the spread of fire to the auditorium. The Dryden Theatre at the George Eastman Museum is one of a few theaters in the world that is capable of safely projecting nitrate films, and regularly screens films to the public.|$|R
