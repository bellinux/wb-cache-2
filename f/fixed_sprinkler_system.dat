5000|$|The blaze {{started as}} a fire on a {{workbench}} in a piano shop, although city fire marshals never determined the exact cause. City investigators found Antares had not <b>fixed</b> the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system,</b> although it knew the system was broken when it bought the building in October 2005 from Heyman Properties of Westport. To fix it would have required cutting off the heat in the building as a new heating system was installed, and Antares was waiting until later in the spring or summer for that, Bruce Macleod, operations chief at Antares, had said, according to The Advocate, Stamford's daily newspaper. Heyman officials knew of the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> problems [...] "and did nothing to fix them for years, the city's chief fire marshal said in April," [...] The Advocate reported. The <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> had broken in the 1990s, when heat was turned off in vacant parts of the building, causing water in the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> to freeze, cracking the pipes.|$|R
5000|$|Depending on {{regional}} nomenclature, the term [...] "dry riser" [...] may {{refer to a}} standpipe, intended to provide water to fire hose connections, or a vertical main pipe in an automatic dry pipe fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system.</b> A dry standpipe comprises a fire department connection, e.g. Storz, which is an external access point at ground level through which water can be pumped from the fire department's fire engine pump to firefighters' fire hose attachments on each floor, whereas a dry pipe fire <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> is a network of pipes connected to <b>fixed</b> <b>sprinklers</b> inside a building, which are full of air until one of the sprinklers is triggered.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Biological & Agricultural EngineeringDanny H. RogersCenter pivot {{irrigation}} systems {{are used in}} crop production across the state of Kansas. The American Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers (ASABE) standard on uniformity testing of a center pivot system calls for collectors {{to be used to}} measure the water depth emitted by the irrigation system. The standard was designed without specially considering the low pressure sprinklers now commonly used on center pivot systems; the recommended collectors may not accurately measure the applied depth from these sprinklers. The collector size effect on measured water depth and measured depth variability was studied for spinning plate, fixed plate, and wobbling plate <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems.</b> Five different collector sizes (C 2 (5. 5 cm), C 4 (10. 0 cm), C 6 (14. 8 cm), C 8 (20. 0 cm), and C 10 (27. 4 cm)) were studied using four 5 x 5 Latin squares. Each collector’s water depth was measured and statistically analyzed. Two analysis of variance (ANOVA) tests of the collector size effect were reported. Past experimental results were compared to this experiment’s results. The ANOVA for the measured water depth reported no collector size effect for the spinning plate and wobbling plate systems. The ANOVA of the variability of measured depths showed significant differences between collector sizes for the spinning plate system but not for the wobbling plate system. Previous studies of spinning plate and wobbling plate systems reported acceptable variability for all collector sizes. Although some collector sizes measured significantly different mean depths, the numerical difference in mean depths was small. Any studied collector size could be used to measure the water depth of wobbling plate systems, but the C 4 collector is ideal. C 4 and C 6 collectors are ideal for measuring spinning plate systems. Significant differences between measured depths were reported for the fixed plate system. The C 10 measured significantly lower water depths than all other collectors, and the C 4 collector measured lower depths than the C 2 and C 8 collectors. The variability of mean depths was similar and high for all collector sizes. Previous experiments also indicated that different collector sizes measured different depths and had high variability of depth measurements for the <b>fixed</b> plate <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems.</b> The distinct stream pattern provides a challenge for accurately measuring the water depth with these collector sizes; other methods of measuring uniformity should be considered for <b>fixed</b> plate <b>sprinklers...</b>|$|R

Evaporation and wind draft Losses were measured at different applied pressures under various conditions of atmospheric. The results showed that parameters of vapor pressure deficit and temperatures had the highest correlation with evaporation and wind draft losses in all three types of sprinklers, and this correlation is significant at the 1 % probability level. Also results showed that the correlation between wind velocity and losses is in sprinklers of ZM 22 and ZK 30 significant at the 1 % and 5 % probability level respectively and in the sprinkler AMBO is no significant correlation.

50|$|<b>Sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> in {{residential}} structures {{are becoming more}} common {{as the cost of}} such systems becomes more practical and the benefits become more obvious. Residential <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> usually fall under a residential classification separate from the commercial classifications mentioned above. A commercial <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> is designed to protect the structure and the occupants from a fire. Most residential <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> are primarily designed to suppress a fire in such a way to allow for the safe escape of the building occupants. While these systems will often also protect the structure from major fire damage, this is a secondary consideration. In residential structures sprinklers are often omitted from closets, bathrooms, balconies, garages and attics because a fire in these areas would not usually impact the occupant's escape route.|$|R
30|$|System-based studies, {{by their}} nature, {{provide the best}} average {{estimates}} of overall <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> effectiveness. However, since fires are relatively rare events, system-based studies often do not {{provide detailed information on}} specific types of <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems,</b> specific <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> configurations, or other systems present. Fires occur in all ages of buildings, so even new fire incident data includes old <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> designs. In general, the specifications or standard that the incident <b>sprinkler</b> <b>systems</b> were designed to are not available. Maintenance, inspection, and testing data is also not included, so it is difficult to estimate the effects of these aspects on system effectiveness. General details regarding the building of fire origin such as size, geometry, and construction may not be documented and changes to the building use and hazard between the time of design and the incident {{are not likely to be}} recorded. Thus it is difficult to estimate how system improvements such as upgraded water supplies or piping networks, or improved inspection, maintenance, and testing practices, will improve system effectiveness from system-based studies. In addition, determining whether a <b>sprinkler</b> <b>system</b> operated effectively or not and the reasons why it may or may not have can require subjective judgement on the part of the reporter, which creates uncertainty in the reported outcome.|$|R
