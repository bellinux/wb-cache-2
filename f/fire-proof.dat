5|$|A fire {{swept through}} Westminster in 1834, {{destroying}} {{most of the}} old palace, but the Jewel Tower, which was separated from the main fire and was positioned away from the prevailing wind, survived, along with its store of records from the House of Lords. Westminster was rebuilt, and in 1864 substantial changes were made at the tower: the Parliamentary records in the tower were moved to a <b>fire-proof</b> storage facility at the new Victoria Tower; 6–7 Old Palace Yard ceased {{to be used by}} the clerk as a house, and the kitchen in the ground floor of the tower was closed. Around this time, the tower began to be called the Jewel Tower once again, partially in the incorrect belief that it had held the Crown Jewels during the medieval period.|$|E
5|$|According to the Accident Investigation Board Norway, {{the rescue}} work was {{hampered}} by, among other things: lack of fire crew at Voss {{to drive the}} fire engine, a defective helicopter bucket, and a three-hour delay from the fire to a rail carriage with water was sent from Ål. Also, the fire carriage from Voss arrived six hours after the accident was reported. Concerns were raised regarding the fire hazards of wooden snow tunnels, and the National Rail Administration admitted {{that they should be}} made of a more <b>fire-proof</b> material, such as concrete or steel. Following the accident, the National Rail Administration decided that all welding would have to be monitored for several hours after completion of the work.|$|E
25|$|In June 1962, the hotel's opening {{was delayed}} until October 1, 1962. Simultaneously, county {{officials}} {{discovered that the}} three-story stucco hotel may be in violation of fire codes. A request was made for the owner to propose plans to fireproof the hotel's wooden roof and attic. County officials suggested the installation of either a sprinkler system or sheet rock in the attic, {{as well as the}} addition of <b>fire-proof</b> materials {{on the roof of the}} hotel structures. In November 1962, key positions in the resort were being named while an opening date of Christmas week was being planned.|$|E

50|$|The Palace of Arts, {{which was}} <b>fire-proofed,</b> {{contained}} historical room sets, {{as well as}} painting and sculpture since the eighteenth century. It also displayed the Queen’s Dolls House, now at Windsor Castle, which even contained miniature bottles of Bass beer.|$|R
50|$|The {{investigation}} report resulted in improved <b>fire-proofing</b> of all such carriages {{and the provision}} of through-corridors between carriages. Although the electrically-operated doors had manual overrides positioned under the passenger seats, this was poorly signed. The report resulted in their being marked with red signage.|$|R
25|$|At {{the other}} depot, at Voldsminde, {{the company had}} a fleet of 19 trams and four trailers. During the night and morning, these were {{immediately}} taken into service. Some were not in proper operating condition, having been untouched since 1951, while others had only been there a year. In {{the course of the}} day, eleven of the trams were made available for operation. One of the Class 5 bogie trams that was still in regular service had survived because it had overnighted in the other depot. All the ten Class 2 and seven of the Class 3 trams could be put into service {{in the course of a}} few days. Behind the <b>fire-proof</b> doors at the paint shop at Dalsenget was a single Class 4 tram with a trailer that had survived the fire.|$|E
25|$|At {{night on}} 10 October 1956, the Dalsenget Depot caught fire, {{destroying}} {{almost all of}} the modern tram fleet. 26 trams, 16 trailers and one working tram were destroyed, and three cleaners lost their lives. It was the then-largest fire in Trondheim after World War II. One tram and trailer survived from within the <b>fire-proof</b> paint shop. Trondheim Sporvei had never discarded its old trams - they were stored at Voldsminde Depot - and eleven old trams were in service within the day. In addition, eight buses were borrowed from Oslo within the week. Damage was at NOK 9 million, of which 8 million was for the rolling stock. A proposal to replace the tramway with trolleybuses was discarded by the city council. The depot was rebuilt, and 28 new Class 7 trams were ordered, in addition to 15 trailers. The bogies and motors were salvaged, and reused in the new trams. The new stock was delivered in 1957 and 1958.|$|E
25|$|James Rand Jr. soon {{took the}} company on a buying spree. The company became the largest {{supplier}} of office furniture in the world through its 1926 acquisition of Globe Wernicke Co., but was forced to divest itself of the business later that year after an antitrust action. Between 1927 and 1929, the company merged with or bought {{out a number of}} companies, including Index Visible, Inc. (which had been founded by Yale University economist Irving Fisher), Safe-Cabinet Co. (which had invented the <b>fire-proof</b> safe), Library Bureau, Inc. (which had invented the filing cabinet), Dalton Adding Machine and Baker-Vawter Ledger. For a brief time in 1926, the company was known as Rand Kardex Bureau, Inc. In 1927, James Rand Jr. merged his company with the Remington Typewriter Co. (which had invented the noiseless and electric typewriters) and changed its name to Remington Rand. Company sales grew from $5 million in 1927 to $500 million in 1954.|$|E

500|$|Several of {{the special}} effects used in the episode were created in a [...] "low-stress" [...] manner that did not rely wholly on Computer-generated imagery. During the {{childbirth}} scene, gas-burners were set a distance away from a <b>fire-proof</b> bed. The scene was then filmed with a long lens to give {{the effect that the}} fire was mere inches away from the bed. Producer John Shiban said that the film crew made [...] "a big deal out of the eyes" [...] to make the scene frightening. The devil sonogram was created by using the videotape of a real sonogram of a crew member's wife. The videotape was then edited to give it a demonic look.|$|E
500|$|Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique {{gave the}} episode a {{slightly}} negative review and awarded it one-and-a-half stars out of four. Despite noting, [...] "after episodes about butt-crawling and vomiting, it's {{a relief to}} have one in which people die when their skin and muscles are fried away by microscopic sea creatures called medusas", Vitaris was critical of the plot, likening it to [...] "cliche" [...] 1970's movies that featured the [...] "obstreperous official insisting the plane must fly or the skyscraper is <b>fire-proof,</b> even when the potential for catastrophe is staring him in the face."

500|$|Based on {{a review}} of CCTV footage, the {{programme}} purports {{to demonstrate that the}} self-immolators donned <b>fire-proof</b> clothing and masks, and raises the question of why the participants' hair and the apparently gasoline-filled bottles they carried did not catch fire. Falun Gong sources also noted that the self-immolators' behaviour, the slogans they shouted, and their meditation postures were not consistent with the teachings or practices of Falun Gong. Furthermore, the program's frame-by-frame analysis of the CCTV footage purportedly shows that Liu was actually killed by a deadly blow to the head from a man in a military overcoat. The False Fire documentary described the death of 12-year-old Liu Siying as being under [...] "unusual circumstances", saying that she was apparently recovering well before dying suddenly on 17 March. Some Falun Gong sources argue that she may have been killed by the government as a way of guaranteeing her silence.|$|E
500|$|The Great Tower {{was a large}} {{structure}} of grey sandstone, [...] tall, formed of a four-storey tower, [...] internally, linked to a smaller seven-storey tower or turret, [...] across. The ground floor contained the basement and the entrance-way, protected by a portcullis. The first floor held the kitchen, and had a <b>fire-proof</b> stone-vaulted roof. [...] The upper floors consisted of a parlour and a separate great chamber for the lord, with a withdrawing chamber to one side, all with grander windows than the lower levels, with excellent views of the gardens and the parkland beyond. A treasure chamber, accessible only from the upper storeys using a ladder, was built into the first floor. Emery considers the [...] "richness of the upper rooms and the tower's planning and design qualities" [...] to be outstanding, and likens it to the Yellow Tower of Ghent at Raglan Castle.|$|E

The entrance hall contains a columned Doric screen with a 19th-century ribbed and bossed ceiling. The old dining room to the right of this features a coffered ceiling dated to the 17th century, containing [...] "low plaster relief mouldings including guilloché, acanthus and egg and dart". The chimney piece has been removed. The drawing room to rear of the property also features a richly adorned coffered ceiling with [...] "frieze bearing rosette bands" [...] and a [...] "centre oval with bay leaf design". The 17th-century staircase features thick balusters and prominent finials, with foliage patterns ingrained in the plasterwork of the handrail. [...] A billiard room was added to the house in 1896. A strongroom with [...] walls and heavy steel <b>fire-proof</b> doors was added in 1914, for the Dynevors to keep their important documents and valuables. On the upper floors are rooms with 18th-century fittings, including [...] "panelled dados, lugged architraves, low relief plaster ceilings and closets within angled turrets". The bedroom on the northeast of the house features a particularly detailed coffered ceiling with floral patterns.|$|E

500|$|Flames {{could be}} seen as far away as Corvallis. One {{volunteer}} firefighter, Floyd McMullen, a student at Willamette University, died in the fire, which drew firefighters {{from as far away as}} Portland. Salem sent seven fire trucks to the scene; three more came from Portland. Only the outer walls were left standing after the fire was extinguished. Losses were estimated at $1.5 million ($ as of [...] ), and the state did not carry insurance. The losses, which included historic artifacts such as the portraits of all the governors, could have been worse had the state not used <b>fire-proof</b> vaults in the basement to store valuables such as more than $1 million ($ as of [...] ) in stocks and bonds. During the blaze, firefighters poured water on these vaults to help keep them cool and prevent the contents from disintegrating. Years earlier, the state had turned over many historical documents to the Oregon Historical Society in Portland for preservation, and those records were preserved. Although the Supreme Court had moved to the Oregon Supreme Court Building in 1914, the two buildings were connected by underground tunnels used for electricity and heating. At the time of the fire, the Oregon State Library was in the basement and first floor of the Supreme Court Building. Many books in the basement suffered water damage when water used to fight the fire flooded underground tunnels and seeped into the Supreme Court Building. Offices previously housed in the capitol were moved to other government buildings and to leased space in downtown Salem until a new building was built.|$|E

40|$|The {{remarkable}} biological {{properties of}} tanninboron wood preservatives for outdoor applications {{have been investigated}} recently (Thevenon et al. in Eur. J. Wood Prod. 67 : 89, 2009). In the present paper mechanical and <b>fire-proofing</b> attributes of these formulations are determined. Mechanical properties of Scots pine and beech specimens treated with tannin-based formulations were examined in compression and bending strength tests and surface hardness was determined. The tannin-hexamine formulations reticulated into the wood structure improve {{the strength of the}} treated specimens. The treated samples which underwent compression, bending, hardness and gluing tests showed improvements of on average 20 %. Fire tests have been monitored regarding short and long flame exposure time. Short tests such as ignition, flame and ember time have allowed the ignition of the fire to be simulated, while the weight loss tests have provided a good overview of the behavior of the specimens during prolonged fire. A positive effect on fire-resistance is shown when wood is treated with tannin formulations. The <b>fire-proofing</b> properties of the resin have been upgraded adding boron and phosphorus. The ember time of the pieces treated using this method can be reduced by up to ten times. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
