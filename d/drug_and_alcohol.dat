5|$|Tertiary sexual {{dysfunction}} results from {{psychological and social}} factors. Reduced libido, desire, or experience of arousal {{could be due to}} psychological or situational factors such as depression, anxiety, and changes in relationships. Both sexes experience reduced sexual desire after SCI, and almost half of men and almost three quarters of women have trouble becoming psychologically aroused. Depression is {{the most common cause of}} problems with arousal in people with SCI. People frequently experience grief and despair initially after the injury. Anxiety and <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> abuse may increase after discharge from a hospital as new challenges occur, which can exacerbate sexual difficulties. <b>Drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> abuse increase unhealthy behaviors, straining relationships and social functioning.|$|E

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Mobile Telecommunication and Innovation at (MSc. MTI) at Strathmore UniversityThe number of people dying of <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> induced causes is alarmingly high and is gradually rising. One reason for the high numbers is that most <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users are not aware when they transition into addicts. However, some users {{believe that they are}} in control of their <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> usage. Other users might be aware of their addiction but may not get help due to: the high cost of getting help, the absence of help, or the fear of stigmatisation. Some of those aware might have accepted the addiction as part of their life, or might have other personal reasons for not seeking help. To reduce the deaths, <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users need to know if they are addicted, the severity of the addiction and how to manage the addiction. To identify and manage an addiction, a <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> assessment is done by a trained clinician who then recommends ways to help manage the addiction. This could be costly to most <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users, <b>and</b> family or friends might get involved which can lead to stigmatisation. A review on <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> assessment tools <b>and</b> existing applications was done to get an understanding of how the tools work and how they can be improved. Existing <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> assessment <b>and</b> management mobile applications where analysed to identify their strengths and areas of improvements. The review of the tools and analysis of the assessment applications provided the requirements needed for the research. The identified requirements helped in designing a scheme that was implemented to help the users and addict. The solution was verified and validated {{to make sure that it}} meets the users’ requirements through accurate assessment results on <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> use, <b>and</b> enabling addicts manage their addictions. The methodology used was applied research through prototyping. This was done by using a quantitative and qualitative research approach using: interviews, observation, questionnaires and documentary analysis. Interviews with <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> users, addicts <b>and</b> clinicians was done to find out the need of the application and their expectations and suggestions. Observation was used to see how <b>drugs</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> assessment is done, and questionnaires was given to addicts and users to identify their needs and the need of the application, existing gaps and their expectations. Documentary analysis was used to gather information on the assessment and diagnosis tools, and information on existing applications to identify their strengths and areas of improvement...|$|R

5|$|Epileptic {{seizures}} {{are thought}} to relate to abnormal electrical activity. Seizure activity can manifest as absence (of consciousness), focal effects such as limb movement or impediments of speech, or be generalized in nature. Status epilepticus refers to a seizure or series of seizures that have not terminated within 30 minutes, although this definition has recently been revised. Seizures have {{a large number of}} causes, however many seizures occur without a definitive cause being found. In a person with epilepsy, risk factors for further seizures may include sleeplessness, <b>drug</b> <b>and</b> <b>alcohol</b> intake, and stress. Seizures may be assessed using blood tests, EEG and various medical imaging techniques based on the medical history and exam findings. In addition to treating an underlying cause and reducing exposure to risk factors, anticonvulsant medications can play a role in preventing further seizures.|$|E
