40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to find whether an {{adsorbent}} used as an additive in the feed mixtures could influence the concentration of <b>free</b> available <b>zinc.</b> The feed supplement ZeoFeed, which often constitutes a part of animal feed mixtures, mainly for poultry, was used as adsorbent {{in the amount of}} 10 g·kg- 1 of the feed mixture. A substantial part of ZeoFeed is clinoptilolite, a natural form of zeolite. Two sample preparation methods were used for the determination of zinc.

The total zinc concentration (mean ± 95 % confidence interval) in the feed mixture without addition of clinoptilolite was found to be 145 ± 32. 0 mg·kg- 1 and in the feed mixture with added clinoptilolite 146 ± 11. 5 mg·kg- 1.

40|$|AbstractPteridium aquilinum, one of {{the most}} {{important}} poisonous plants in the world, is known to be carcinogenic to animals and humans. Moreover, our previous studies showed that the immunosuppressive effects of ptaquiloside, its main toxic agent, were prevented by selenium in mouse natural killer (NK) cells. We also verified that this immunosuppression facilitated development of cancer. Here, we performed gene expression microarray analysis in splenic NK cells from mice treated for 14 days with ptaquiloside (5. 3 mg/kg) and/or selenium (1. 3 mg/kg) to identify gene transcripts altered by ptaquiloside that could be linked to the immunosuppression and that would be prevented by selenium. Transcriptome analysis of ptaquiloside samples revealed that 872 transcripts were expressed differentially (fold change> 2 and p< 0. 05), including 77 up-regulated and 795 down-regulated transcripts. Gene ontology analysis mapped these up-regulated transcripts to three main biological processes (cellular ion homeostasis, negative regulation of apoptosis and regulation of transcription). Considering the immunosuppressive effect of ptaquiloside, we hypothesized that two genes involved in cellular ion homeostasis, metallothionein 1 (Mt 1) and metallothionein 2 (Mt 2), could be implicated because Mt 1 and Mt 2 are responsible for zinc homeostasis, and a reduction of <b>free</b> intracellular <b>zinc</b> impairs NK functions. We confirm these hypotheses and show increased expression of metallothionein in splenic NK cells and reduction in <b>free</b> intracellular <b>zinc</b> following treatment with ptaquiloside that were completely prevented by selenium co-treatment.

HUVECs were exposed to high steady shear stress (15 dyn/cm 2), low steady shear stress (1 dyn/cm 2), or reversing shear stress (mean of 1 dyn/cm 2, 1 Hz) for 24 h. Gene expression of three MT- 1 isoforms, MT- 2 A, and zinc transporter- 1 was upregulated by low steady shear stress and reversing shear stress.

40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} element for numerous cellular processes. In this work, we developed a series of highly selective, sensitive and quantitative zinc sensors based on carbonic anhydrase (CA). An aryl sulfonamide ligand of CA exhibits a large fluorescence signal coupled to zinc binding, forming a Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) pair with a red fluorescent protein fused to CA. These sensors respond to alterations in physiological <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> concentrations, and are applied to Escherichia coli to quantify the readily exchangeable zinc concentration. In minimal media, E. coli BL 21 (DE 3) cells expressing the CA sensors exhibit a median intracellular readily exchangeable zinc concentration of 20 pM. To understand the functions of ZitB and ZntA, important transporters in zinc detoxification in E. coli, we applied the sensor H 94 N CA_TagRFP to monitor the intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> changes in wild type, ∆zitB and ∆zntA strains upon sudden exposure to toxic levels of zinc (“zinc shock”). The intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> increases transiently from picomolar to nanomolar levels. The corresponding zinc-dependent changes in the zntA mRNA level indicate that ZntR-mediated transcription of zntA exhibits an apparent K 1 / 2 for zinc activation in the nanomolar range in vivo. In the ∆zitB strain the <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> concentration rises more rapidly after zinc shock compared to wild-type cells, while a prolonged accumulation of <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> is observed in the ∆zntA strain. Based on these results, we propose that ZitB functions as a constitutive, first-line defense against toxic zinc influx, while ZntA is up-regulated to efficiently lower the <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> concentration. 	The zinc detoxification functions of three transporters and a periplasmic protein regulated by the BaeS/R two-component system were explored.

40|$|Zinc is an {{essential}} trace element for {{the immune system and}} regulates the function of monocytes. Intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> can bind reversibly to regulatory sites in signaling proteins, whereby changes of <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> influence signal transduction. To achieve a broad picture about the role of zinc in monocytes, short- and long-term changes in intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> were investigated. Experiments with the myeloid cell line HL- 60 showed that short-term zinc signals after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were characteristic for differentiated, tumor necrosis factor-alpha secreting cells, and were essential for LPS-induced signal transduction. LPS-induced zinc signals were repetitive and derived from intracellular stores in Raw 264. 7 cells. This was partially mediated by tyrosine kinases, as demonstrated by a screening with 16 inhibitors for signal transduction components. Additionally, inhibitory G proteins could be involved in the generation of the LPS-induced zinc signal. Furthermore the observed transient increase in intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> after activation of inhibitory G proteins alone suggests an impact of zinc in the signaling of G protein coupled receptors. Myelopoiesis is augmented during zinc deficiency in mice, indicating an inhibitory function of zinc. In this work, a long-term decrease of intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> was observed during differentiation of HL- 60 towards monocytes with 1 alpha, 25 -dihydroxyvitamin D 3 (1, 25 VD 3). This was accompanied by a decrease of zinc importer expression and an upregulation of the zinc binding proteins S 100 A 8 and -A 9. The use of the zinc chelator TPEN enhanced 1, 25 VD 3 -induced expression of monocytic surface markers (CD 14 /CD 11 b) in three cell lines and enhanced functionality of HL- 60 (oxidative burst, TNF secretion). Thus, not only short-term signals, but also long-term changes of zinc homeostasis serve as endogenous modulators of monocyte function. Zinc inhibits the cAMP synthesizing enzyme adenylate cyclase (AC) thereby lowering cAMP concentrations after stimulation with forskolin in HL- 60. Conversely, TPEN increased cAMP synthesis indicating that AC is partially inhibited already by physiological levels of <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> in HL- 60. Because cAMP is synthesized during 1, 25 VD 3 -induced differentiation and enhances this process, the observed decrease of intracellular <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> after treatment with 1, 25 VD 3 could acts as a physiological mechanism to facilitate differentiation towards monocytes. Thereby, this work discovers a thus far unknown function of zinc in the immune system and expands the understanding of myeloid differentiation. This knowledge could be used to modulate monocytic differentiation and lead to new approaches for the therapy of acute myeloid leukemia...|$|E
40|$|Cells protect {{themselves}} from zinc toxicity by inducing proteins such as metallothionein (MT) that bind it tightly, by sequestering it in organelles, or by exporting it. In this study, the interplay between zinc binding by MT and its efflux by zinc transporter 1 (ZnT 1) was examined genetically. Inactivation of the Znt 1 gene in baby hamster kidney (BHK) cells that do not express their Mt genes results in a zinc-sensitive phenotype and {{a high level of}} “free” zinc. Restoration of Mt gene expression increases resistance to zinc toxicity ≈ 4 -fold, but only slightly reduces <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> levels. Expression of ZnT 1 provides greater protection (≈ 7 -fold) and lowers <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> substantially. Selection for zinc resistance in BHK cells that cannot synthesize either MT or ZnT 1 is ineffective. However, parental BHK cells that grow in high concentrations (> 500 μM) of zinc can be selected; these cells have amplified their endogenous Znt 1 genes. The Znt 1 gene is also amplified in zinc-resistant mouse cells that cannot induce their Mt genes. However, if Mt genes can be expressed, then they are preferentially amplified. Thus, both ZnT 1 and MT genes contribute to zinc resistance in BHK cells, whereas ZnT 1 plays a larger role in regulating <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> levels...|$|E
40|$|Trifolirhizin is {{a potent}} {{polycyclic}} flavonoid with anticarcinogenic effects. The treatment of 25 μM trifolirhizin in human derived prostate cancer LNCaP cells for 6 days decreased cell proliferation by 40 %. Higher dosages caused the proliferation inhibition effect to be manifested in as early as 3 days. Another prostate cancer cell line, PC- 3, was not affected by trifolirhizin till 125 μM resulting in about 45 % reduction in cell proliferation after 4 to 6 days of incubation. Most importantly, for normal human prostate epithelial (NHPrE) cells, trifolirhizin was effective only at the highest concentration of 200 µM. The proliferation inhibition in trifolirhizin-treated LNCaP and PC- 3 cells was associated with cell cycle arrest at the G 0 /G 1 and G 2 /M phase, respectively. Moreover, the expression of cyclin E was unchanged but that of cyclin D 1, p 53, p 21 and p-Rb was suppressed in 50 μM trifolirhizin-treated LNCaP cells. To evaluate the influence of resveratrol on cellular zinc status, NHPrE cells were treated with 6 levels of resveratrol (0, 0. 5, 1, 2. 5, 5 and 10 μM) and 4 levels of zinc [0, 4, 16 and 32 μM representing zinc deficient (ZD), zinc normal (ZN), zinc adequate (ZA) and zinc supplemented (ZS), respectively]. Among each zinc treatment, a progressive reduction in cell growth or increase in cellular total zinc was observed with increases of resveratrol from 2. 5, 5 and 10 μM or from 5 and 10 μM, respectively. In ZS cells a much higher increase in cellular total zinc was observed as early as 1 μM resveratrol.

CD 4 T cell activation was associated with zinc influx via the zinc transporter Zip 6, leading to increased <b>free</b> cytoplasmic <b>zinc</b> and activation of negative feedback loops, including the induction of zinc-binding metallothioneins. In young adults, activation-induced cytoplasmic zinc concentrations declined after 2 days to below prestimulation levels. In contrast, activated naïve CD 4 T cells from older individuals failed to downregulate cytoplasmic zinc, resulting in excessive induction of metallothioneins. Activation-induced metallothioneins regulated the redox state in activated T cells and accounted for an increased proliferation of old CD 4 T cells, suggesting that regulation of T cell zinc homeostasis functions as a compensatory mechanism to preserve the replicative potential of naïve CD 4 T cells with age...|$|R

Moreover, in the human brain, DHA is considered as the main structural omega- 3 fatty acid, which comprises about 40 % of the PUFAs in total. DHA deficiency may be the cause of many disorders such as depression, inability to concentrate, excessive mood swings, anxiety, cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, dry skin and so on.

For this purpose several test specimens were produced. A <b>zinc</b> <b>free,</b> a <b>zinc</b> containing and an increased zinc containing alloy were used. For each alloy twelve series consisting of seven test specimens were manufactured. The test specimens revealed different surface treatments. Per alloy there was one series made by manufacturer instruction, these were used as the control group. The test specimens according to the series they belonged to were veneered in the same way with ceramic material and then bond strength tested using the SCHWICKERATH - test which is defined in DIN EN ISO 9693 : 2000 [1]. Subsequent the veneering ceramic material was removed completely from the test specimens by fracturing it down. In the oversight of the surface break the remaining surface coverage opaque layer on the alloy was determined. Finally there was a longitudinal micro section of the test specimen of each series produced, which was lowest bond strength tested by the SCHWICKERATH – test. These test specimens were examined digital microscopically for gas inclusions in the opaque layer. Generally it was noticed, that the bond strength of the <b>zinc</b> <b>free</b> alloy has been higher than for the zinc containing alloys. The observation led to the conclusion, that the experimental increased zinc containing amount affected slightly negative the bond strength. Oxide firing induced rising tendency of bond strength. The reduction of the oxid layer by acid or sandblast seemed thereby tend to have a positive effect. If a paste or powder opaque should be used continues to be dependent on the manufacture instruction. It turns out that it was of advantage to use a powder opaque with a alloy containing zinc. There is no full explanation with the undertaken investigations. Fact is that no increased blistering was observed. Even if it can be clinically observed that a context between large bubbles occurring when there is use of a bio alloy and paste opaque, this has not been proven experimentally. Why clinically in the veneering of bio alloys with paste opaque occasionally formations of large gas bubbles remain is unclear. It is observed that with large gas bubbles in opaque, the opaque extensively lift off the alloy surface. On the relevant alloy surface hardly any detectable opaque remains, on the bubble interior side of the veneering are usually no visible alloy oxides to found [2]. _______________________________________________________________________ 1.

Upon neuronal activation, the vesicular contents {{are released}} into the synaptic space, whereby the zinc modulates activity of postsynaptic neurons though interactions with receptors, transporters and exchangers. However, high extracellular concentrations of zinc trigger seizures and are neurotoxic if substantial amounts of zinc re-enter the cells via ion channels and accumulate in the cytoplasm. Tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), a secreted serine protease, is also pro-epileptic and excitotoxic. However, tPA counters zinc toxicity by promoting zinc import back into the neurons in a sequestered form that is non-toxic. Here, we identify the zinc influx transporter, ZIP 4, as the pathway through which tPA mediates the zinc uptake. We show that ZIP 4 is upregulated after excitotoxin stimulation of the mouse, male and female, hippocampus. ZIP 4 physically interacts with tPA, correlating with an increased intracellular zinc influx and lysosomal sequestration.

After dilution of nuclear or whole-cell extracts from Zn-treated cells and incubation at 37 degrees C, mouse MTF- 1 DNA-binding activity was no longer detected but could be completely reconstituted by the subsequent readdition of zinc. In vitro-synthesized, recombinant mouse MTF- 1 displayed a similar, reversible temperature- and Zn-dependent activation of DNA-binding activity. Analysis of deletion mutants of recombinant MTF- 1 suggests that the Zn finger domain is important for the Zn-dependent activation of DNA-binding capacity. Thus, mouse MTF- 1 functions as a reversibly activated sensor of <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> pools in the cell...|$|E
40|$|It is {{hypothesized}} that exposing endothelial cells to steady or non-reversing pulsatile shear stress produces a healthy, anti-atherogenic endothelium, whereas a reversing pulsatile shear stress promotes an unhealthy, pro-atherogenic endothelium. To further investigate this hypothesis, a novel parallel plate flow chamber system {{was used to}} expose human endothelial cells to a pro-atherogenic reversing shear stress waveform designed to simulate the wall shear stress at the carotid sinus, a region prone to atherosclerosis. Cells exposed to this reversing shear stress were compared to cells exposed {{to high levels of}} steady shear stress (15 dynes/cm²), low steady shear stress (1 dyne/cm², the time-average of the carotid shear stress), and static culture conditions. Functional analysis confirmed previous findings that reversing shear stress increases cell proliferation and monocyte adhesion. Microarray results indicate that although there are unique sets of genes controlled by both low average shear stress and by reversing flow, more genes were controlled by low average shear stress. We propose that low-time average shear stress, and not fluid reversal/oscillation, may be the more significant mechanical force. The reversing shear stress system was also used to investigate two shear stress-responsive genes, CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1. Both were maximally up-regulated at arterial steady shear stresses of at least 15 dynes/cm² and reversing pulsatile shear stress attenuated expression of both genes. Furthermore, AhR nuclear localization and CYP 1 A 1 protein expression correlate with the flow patterns in the mouse aortic arch. The data strongly suggest that the AhR/CYP 1 pathway promotes an anti-atherogenic phenotype in the endothelium. Changes in <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> were measured under different shear stresses. High steady shear stress dramatically increases the levels of <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> in endothelial cells as compared to cells grown in static culture. This increase in <b>free</b> <b>zinc</b> is attenuated under reversing shear stress and low steady shear stress, which correlates with an increase in zinc-binding metallothinein proteins and zinc exporter Znt- 1. Overall, the findings provide further insight into endothelial responses to mechanical forces and may be important in understanding mechanisms of atherosclerotic development and localization to regions of disturbed flow.

40|$|Aim of the {{investigation}} was the development of tool coatings for lubricant <b>free</b> forming of <b>zinc</b> coated steel and aluminium to avoid ecologically harzardous lubricants and washing procedures. Metal carbon coatings produced by reactive sputtering have been studied for this purpose. As the result the practicability on principle could be shown for special forming processes. For a complete solution there is considerable development work to do. Especially the specific material, tool coating and forming process combination has to be considered. The results of this project are of relevance also for metal cutting tools and the coating of components. (orig.)

40|$|Zinc (Zn 2 +) {{appears to}} be intimately {{involved}} in insulin metabolism since insulin secretion is correlated with zinc secretion in response to glucose stimulation, but {{little is known about}} the regulation of zinc homeostasis in pancreatic beta-cells. This study set out to identify the intracellular zinc transient by imaging <b>free</b> cytosolic <b>zinc</b> in HIT-T 15 beta-cells with fluorescent zinc indicators. We observed that membrane depolarization by KCl (30 – 60 [*]mM) was able to induce a rapid increase in cytosolic concentration of zinc. Multiple zinc transients of similar magnitude were elicited during repeated stimulations. The amplitude of zinc responses was not affected by the removal of extracellular calcium or zinc. However, the half-time of the rising slope was significantly slower after removing extracellular zinc with zinc chelator CaEDTA, suggesting that extracellular zinc affect the initial rising phase of zinc response. Glucose (10 [*]mM) induced substantial and progressive increases in intracellular zinc concentration in a similar way as KCl, with variation in the onset and the duration of zinc mobilization. It is known that the depolarization of beta-cell membrane is coupled with the secretion of insulin. Rising intracellular zinc concentration may act as a critical signaling factor in insulin metabolism of pancreatic beta-cells...|$|R
40|$|Several {{processes}} by which astrocytes protect neurons during ischemia are now well established. However, less is known about how neurons themselves may influence these processes. Neurons release zinc (Zn 2 +) from presynaptic terminals during ischemia, seizure, head trauma, and hypoglycemia, and modulate postsynaptic neuronal function. Peak extracellular zinc may reach concentrations as high as 400 μM. Excessive levels of <b>free,</b> ionic <b>zinc</b> can initiate DNA damage and the subsequent activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP- 1), which in turn lead to NAD+ and ATP depletion when DNA damage is extensive. In this study, cultured cortical astrocytes were used to explore the effects of zinc on astrocyte glutamate uptake, an energy-dependent process that is critical for neuron survival. Astrocytes incubated with 100 or 400 μM of zinc for 30 min showed significant decreases in ATP levels and glutamate uptake capacity. These changes were prevented by the PARP inhibitors benzamide or DPQ (3, 4 -dihydro- 5 -[4 -(1 -piperidinyl) butoxyl]- 1 (2 H) -isoquinolinone) or PARP- 1 gene deletion (PARP- 1 KO). These findings suggest that release of Zn 2 + from neurons during brain insults could induce PARP- 1 activation in astrocytes, leading to impaired glutamate uptake and exacerbation of neuronal injury...|$|R
