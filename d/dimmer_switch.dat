2500|$|... "Dipping" [...] (low beam) {{headlamps}} {{were introduced}} in 1915 by the Guide Lamp Company, but the 1917 Cadillac system allowed the light to be dipped with a lever inside the car rather than requiring the driver to stop and get out. The 1924 Bilux bulb was the first modern unit, having the light for both low (dipped) and high (main) beams of a headlamp emitting from a single bulb. A similar design was introduced in 1925 by Guide Lamp called the [...] "Duplo". In 1927, the foot-operated <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> or dip switch was introduced and became standard {{for much of the}} century. 1933–34 Packards were equipped with tri-beam headlamps, the bulbs having three filaments. From highest to lowest, the beams were called [...] "country passing", [...] "country driving" [...] and [...] "city driving". The 1934 Nash also used a three-beam system, although in this case, the bulbs were conventional two-filament type, and the intermediate beam combined low beam on the driver's side with high beam on the passenger's side, so as to maximise the view of the roadside while minimizing glare toward oncoming traffic. The last vehicle with a foot-operated <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> were the 1991 Ford F-Series and E-Series [...] vans. Fog lamps were new for 1938 Cadillacs, and their 1954 [...] "Autronic Eye" [...] system automated the selection of high and low beams.|$|E

2500|$|As in {{previous}} years, base Delta 88 and Royale models differed mainly in {{exterior and interior}} trim. Base Deltas had a full bench seat available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl upholstery, while Royales had a notchback bench seat with armrest or optional 60/40 notchback bench, also available in cloth-and-vinyl or all-vinyl trim. All 88s featured an all-new instrument panel with a horizontal sweep speedometer and heater/air conditioning controls moved {{to the center of}} the dash above the radio from the left side of the dash, and continued with the [...] "Message Center" [...] bank of warning lights. The new dash was highlighted with woodgrain trim. The <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> moved from the floor to the turn-signal lever.|$|E
2500|$|Only some CFLs {{are labeled}} for dimming control. Using a dimmer with a {{standard}} CFL is ineffective and can shorten bulb life and void the warranty. Dimmable CFLs are available. The <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> {{used in conjunction with}} a dimmable CFL must be matched to its power consumption range; many dimmers installed for use with incandescent bulbs do not function acceptably below 40W, whereas CFL applications commonly draw power in the range 7–20W. Dimmable CFLs have been marketed before suitable dimmers are available. The dimming range of CFLs is usually between 20% and 90%, but many modern CFLs have a dimmable range of 2% to 100%, more akin to that of incandescent lights. There are two types of dimmable CFL on the market: Standard dimmable CFLs, and [...] "switch-dimmable" [...] CFLs. The latter use a standard light switch, and the on-board electronics chooses the light output level {{based on the number of}} times the switch is turned on and off quickly. Dimmable CFLs are not a 100% replacement for incandescent fixtures that are dimmed for [...] "mood scenes" [...] such as wall sconces in a dining area. Below the 20% limit, the lamp may remain at 20% or flicker or the starter circuitry may stop and restart. Above 80%, the bulb may operate at 100%. However, recent products have solved these problems so that they perform more like incandescent lamps. Dimmable CFLs are more expensive than standard CFLs due to the additional circuitry.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Dimmer</b> <b>Switch</b> - The contestants must {{replace the}} light switch for their room with a <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch.</b> This goes without trouble for Eric, Angie, and Brian M (Angie even stating {{that it was a}} job that she would do herself instead of delegating the job to Roy, as it was back home). Johnnie's <b>dimmer</b> <b>switch</b> does not dim or turn off, because he wired the two wall wires into a closed circuit, instead of to the switch. Brian P's loose {{connections}} and failure to properly ground his switch result in him shorting out the circuit in his room again.|$|E
25|$|Although T-coils are {{effectively}} a wide-band receiver, interference {{is unusual in}} most hearing loop situations. Interference can manifest as a buzzing sound, which varies in volume depending on the distance the wearer is from the source.

5000|$|Dimmability Whether {{or not the}} bulb's {{brightness}} can {{be controlled}} by a dimmer. Most high-CRI LED bulbs are made with the circuitry {{to allow them to}} be dimmed with standard <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches.</b> Some are not able to be dimmed with a wall dimmer, but instead are controlled over a wireless network with a device like a smartphone.|$|R
50|$|Another way {{to reduce}} {{electricity}} conumption and save money with lighting is by installing <b>dimming</b> <b>switches</b> with these bulbs. A dimmer can increase and decrease the amount of light emitted by the bulb to your liking.

40|$|Solid state {{lighting}} (SSL), specifically {{light-emitting diodes}} (LED), has been advancing {{at a rapid}} pace, and there are presently multiple products available that serve as direct replacements for traditional luminaires. In this demonstration, conventional recessed lights {{in a conference room}} were used to compare conventional incandescent A-lamps, incandescent reflector R-lamps, dimming compact fluorescent lamps (CFL), to an LED replacement product. The primary focus during the study was on light delivered to the task plane as provided by the power required by the lighting system. Vertical illuminance, dimming range, and color shift are also important indicators of lighting quality and are discussed in the report. The results clearly showed that LEDs, with dimming-capable drivers, are much more efficient than incandescent and CFLs. Further, LEDs provide much smoother and consistent dimming than dimmable CFLs. On the potential negative side, {{it is important that the}} <b>dimming</b> <b>switch</b> be identified as compatible with the LED driver. A wide variety of <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches</b> are capable of dimming LEDs down to 15 % of full light output, while select others can be capable of dimming LEDs down to 5 %. In addition, LEDs can be intensive light sources, which can result in uncomfortable glare in some applications and to some occupants. Higher ceiling (9 -foot or greater) or non-specular reflectors can act to alleviate the potential for glare...|$|R

25|$|Fluorescent light {{fixtures}} cannot {{be connected to}} <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches</b> intended for incandescent lamps. Two effects are responsible for this: the waveform of the voltage emitted by a standard phase-control dimmer interacts badly with many ballasts, and it becomes difficult to sustain an arc in the fluorescent tube at low power levels. Dimming installations require a compatible dimming ballast. These systems keep the cathodes of the fluorescent tube fully heated even as the arc current is reduced, promoting easy thermionic emission of electrons into the arc stream. CFLs are available that work {{in conjunction with a}} suitable dimmer.|$|R
50|$|A third {{application}} of baluns in audio systems {{is in the}} provision of balanced mains power to the equipment. Due to the common-mode rejection of interference characteristic of balanced mains power, a wide range of noise coming from the wall plug is eliminated, e.g. mains-borne interference from air conditioner/furnace/refrigerator motors, switching noise produced by fluorescent lighting and <b>dimmer</b> <b>switches,</b> digital noise from personal computers, and radio frequency signals picked up by the power lines/cords acting as antennae. This noise infiltrates the audio/video system through the power supplies and raises the noise floor of the entire system.|$|R

5000|$|Variable-speed control. During the 1970s and 1980s, {{fans were}} often {{produced}} with a variable-speed control.
