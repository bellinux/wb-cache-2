500|$|The episode {{received}} critical acclaim. Kenneth Nguyen from The Age commented [...] "'A Trip to the Dentist', {{is perhaps}} the most complex, confronting installment thus far of a series that prides itself on being complex and confronting." [...] The reporter went on to praise the [...] "expertly scripted" [...] reveal and thought Diane Ruggiero's [...] "command of the tightrope high-school milieu seems pretty much spot-on. It is Ruggiero's resolution of the mystery, however, that will keep fans talking. Like the best resolutions, <b>I</b> <b>suppose,</b> <b>it</b> raises more questions than it answers." ...|$|E
500|$|Fernandez {{reporting}} Gaga's {{opinion in}} an interview said that Gaga herself said it smelled good, because it smelled like meat. The designer talked {{of what was to}} happen to the dress after the awards show, [...] "The dress will be put in an archive with all of her dresses. The Gaga Archives, <b>I</b> <b>suppose.</b> <b>It</b> won't last, that's the beauty of it. When it is brought out again, hopefully it will be in a retrospective, {{and it will be a}} different dress, which is the best thing. I like the idea of it changing and evolving into something else". He later explained that the dress would be preserved and made into a type of jerky before being archived.|$|E
500|$|Hunter Davies {{recalled}} that while {{working with the}} Beatles on their authorised biography in 1968, [...] "when the subject of Pete Best came up they seemed to cut off, {{as if he had}} never touched their lives. They showed little reaction … <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> reminded them not just that they had been rather sneaky in the handling of Pete Best's sacking, never telling him to his face, but that for the grace of God, or Brian Epstein, circumstances might have been different and they could have ended up [...]" [...] During the height of Beatlemania Best attempted to commit suicide, but his mother, Mona, and his brother, Rory, talked him out of it.|$|E

500|$|Although Swift found Motte {{willing to}} print the work, {{he was not}} willing to print Swift's {{additional}} scene. Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember how much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (<b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Although David {{had drawn}} on her many {{magazine}} articles for material in her earlier books, An Omelette and Glass of Wine {{was the first}} straightforward anthology of her work. Compiled {{with the assistance of}} Jill Norman, it consists of David's selections from her essays and articles published since 1949 in publications [...] "from the Sunday Times to Nova, from Vogue to the Spectator, from the long defunct travel magazine Go to Cyril Ray's Compleat Imbiber, Peter Dominic's Wine Mine and a quite a few others." [...] Jane Grigson wrote of it, [...] "An Omelette and a Glass of Wine is different from any other book by Elizabeth David. Yet in a sense it includes them, holds them together. We feel closer to Mrs David herself in this book, and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> is the closest we are likely to get to an autobiography" ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never {{seemed to me to be}} a very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E

2500|$|He {{attended}} Ardscoil Éanna in Crumlin, {{where he}} later taught Spanish and History. About his early training {{to become a}} priest, {{he said in an}} interview, [...] "I spent five years in the seminary and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was assumed that one had a vocation. I realised subsequently that I didn't." [...] He attended University College Dublin, where he studied archaeology and linguistics, becoming proficient in Irish.|$|E

Sometimes when you listen back bits of it sound quite punk. I liked Gary Glitter, Hello, Slade; they were all laying the roots to punk. Some of Bowie and Lou Reed were very good and [...] Bolan of course. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> {{had a bit of}} influence, but not a lot."– Knox from the Vibrators citing glam rock acts, {{including}} Glitter, as an influence on punk.|$|E

There be infinite numbers of canoas in this lake, and (as <b>I</b> <b>suppose)</b> <b>it</b> is no other than that, whereon Manoa standeth." ...|$|E
2500|$|Variety {{called the}} film [...] "one {{of the great}} {{cinematic}} achievements of the 1970s." [...] Gene Siskel of The Chicago Tribune also wrote that the film [...] "truly tests a film critic's power of description ... Some critics have complained that the Days of Heaven story is too slight. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> is, but, frankly, you don't think about it while the movie is playing". Time magazine's Frank Rich wrote, [...] "Days of Heaven is lush with brilliant images". The periodical went on to name {{it one of the}} best films of 1978. Nick Schager of Slant Magazine has called it [...] "the greatest film ever made." ...|$|E

Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, & I {{remember}} being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, {{to see that the}} Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, Coupland {{lived in}} the Mojave Desert working on a {{handbook}} about the birth cohort that followed the Baby Boom. He received a $22,500 advance from St. Martin's Press to write the nonfiction handbook. Instead, Coupland wrote a novel, [...] It was rejected in Canada before being accepted by an American publishing house in 1991. Reflecting on the writing of his debut novel years later, Coupland said, [...] "I remember spending my days almost dizzy with loneliness and feeling like I'd sold the family cow for three beans. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was this crippling loneliness that gave Gen X its bite. I was trying to imagine a life for myself on paper that certainly wasn't happening in reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|Kelly {{was to be}} hanged on 11 November 1880 at the Melbourne Gaol. Earlier that day, Mr. Castieau, the {{governor}} of the gaol, informed the condemned man that the hour of execution had been fixed at ten o'clock. Kelly's leg-irons were removed, and after a short time he was marched out. He was submissive on the way, and when passing the gaol's flower beds, he remarked [...] "what a nice little garden", but said nothing further until reaching the Press room, where he remained until the arrival of chaplain Dean Donaghy. Accounts differ about Kelly's last words. Some newspaper reporters wrote that his last words were [...] "Such is life", while other newspapers recorded that this was his response when the warden told him of the intended hour of his execution, earlier that day. The Argus wrote that Kelly's last words were, [...] "Ah, well, <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> has come to this", as the rope was placed round his neck. According to another account, Kelly intended to make a speech, but [...] "made no audible sound." [...] The warden later wrote that Kelly, when prompted to say his last words, mumbled something that was too quiet to discern.|$|E

2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> was one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
