5|$|A town borough was {{formally}} created in 1201, {{and by the}} 1220s there was a settlement established outside the castle gates; some of those residents who had been {{moved out of the}} bailey may have resettled there. Richard built a stone wall around the new town, linking it to the castle defences, intending <b>it</b> <b>both</b> as a defensive measure and to impress visitors.|$|E
5|$|After this {{successful}} {{series of}} patrols, Davis {{was ordered to}} conduct only one patrol a day {{in order to minimize}} the risk to him. The order had previously been sent on December 1, but Davis had apparently ignored <b>it.</b> <b>Both</b> the Air Force and Davis' family had growing concerns that Chinese and Soviet pilots would be gunning for Davis, given his success and fame. By this point, Davis had 12 victories, and the second-highest scoring aces each had 6 victories. Davis was averaging one victory for three missions.|$|E
5|$|Another {{institution}} key to unifying the German states, the Zollverein, {{helped to}} create a larger sense of economic unification. Initially conceived by the Prussian Finance Minister Hans, Count von Bülow, as a Prussian customs union in 1818, the Zollverein linked the many Prussian and Hohenzollern territories. Over the ensuing thirty years (and more) other German states joined. The Union helped to reduce protectionist barriers among the German states, especially improving the transport of raw materials and finished goods, making <b>it</b> <b>both</b> easier to move goods across territorial borders and less costly to buy, transport, and sell raw materials. This was particularly important for the emerging industrial centers, {{most of which were}} located in the Rhineland, the Saar, and the Ruhr valleys.|$|E

5|$|Another problem {{encountered}} when {{applying the}} rational nexus test {{is that of}} over- and under-inclusiveness. Under-inclusiveness occurs when the legislative classification fails to embrace all persons within the ambit of the objective sought to be achieved by the law. On the other hand, over-inclusiveness occurs when the classification not only embraces persons within the ambit of the legislative objective, but also persons outside <b>it.</b> <b>Both</b> over- and under-inclusiveness are currently tolerated in Singapore under the rational nexus test, as a classification can still bear a rational relation to the legislative objective notwithstanding that it embraces more or less persons than its object requires.|$|E
5|$|At the beginning, {{jumping on}} every cube once {{is enough to}} advance. In later stages, each cube must be hit twice to reach the target color. Other times, cubes change color every time Q*bert lands on them, instead of {{remaining}} on the target color once they reach <b>it.</b> <b>Both</b> elements are then combined in subsequent stages. Jumping off the pyramid results in the character's death.|$|E
5|$|At this distance, {{the land}} {{would be far}} beyond the maximum {{anticipated}} size of the city's growth, greatly reducing any potential hazards. The London and South Western Railway(LSWR)– which had connected London to Woking in 1838– would enable bodies and mourners to be shipped from London to the site easily and cheaply. Although the Brookwood site was a long distance from London, Broun and Sprye argued that {{the speed of the}} railway made <b>it</b> <b>both</b> quicker and cheaper to reach than the seven existing cemeteries, all of which required a slow and expensive horse-drawn hearse to carry the body and mourners from London to the burial site.|$|E

5|$|Countershading, like counter-illumination, {{has rarely}} been applied in {{practice}} for military camouflage, though not because military authorities were unaware of <b>it.</b> <b>Both</b> Abbott Thayer in the First World War and Hugh Cott in the Second World War proposed countershading to their countries' armed forces. They each demonstrated the effectiveness of countershading, without succeeding in persuading their armed forces to adopt the technique, though they influenced military adoption of camouflage in general.|$|E

5|$|Displays are {{classified}} as deimatic or aposematic by {{the responses of the}} animals that see them. Where predators are initially startled but learn to eat the displaying prey, the display is classed as deimatic, and the prey is bluffing; where they continue to avoid the prey after tasting it, the display is taken as aposematic, meaning the prey is genuinely distasteful. However, these categories are not entirely mutually exclusive. It is possible for a behaviour to be both deimatic and aposematic, if <b>it</b> <b>both</b> startles a predator and indicates the presence of anti-predator adaptations.|$|E
5|$|Due to its {{architectural}} {{and artistic}} value, the Church of St George {{has been part}} of the list of Bulgaria's monuments of cultural of national importance since 1927.

In the 1983 contest, he would have faced sitting lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins in the primary. Collins was a factional ally of Ford's, which influenced his decision. In 1991, Ford cited his seniority in the Senate and desire to become Democratic Senate whip as factors in his decision not to run for governor.|$|E
