For a sample of large UK listed companies from 2013 we find reasonably high levels of compliance with the Code by both UK and foreign institutional investors.

40|$|Purpose: Exit {{strategies}} {{are critical for}} external private equity holders, such as venture capitalists and business angels, to receive investment returns successfully. The paper models the exit decision as a fixed date with the option to exit early, and develop an approach to help private equity holders determine an optimal early exit region based on a target equity value and the time remaining. Design/methodology/approach: The paper sets up a continuous time model to derive analytical solutions and apply simulations to numerical examples in this study. Findings: By numerically analyzing {{the nature of the}} solution the paper illustrates that a higher return drift of the <b>investee</b> <b>company,</b> a lower return volatility of the <b>investee</b> <b>company,</b> and a higher target return of the private equity holder results a smaller early exit region.

40|$|The study {{explores the}} {{challenges}} UK-based institutional investors face {{when trying to}} monitor investee companies and influence their social, environmental and governance practices.

The results contribute to the literature on institutional investor activism by using direct empirical evidence to systematically discuss the challenges to stewardship.

40|$|This study {{focuses on}} the {{non-financial}} value-added of venture capital investors (VCs) as perceived by the CEOs of Finnish biotechnology companies. It pays attention to differences in the value-added between informal venture capitalists, private sector venture capitalists and public sector venture capital organizations. In addition, this study pays attention to value-adding mechanisms which venture capitalists use in developing their portfolio companies and factors which influence the perceived valueadded. In general, venture capitalists in Finnish biotechnology companies {{were found to be}} rather active hands-on investors, especially in terms of frequent contacts. In addition, their non-financial support was in most cases perceived as important for the success of the Finnish biotechnology companies. The VCs provide value-added indirectly through screening and signaling, and directly through monitoring and providing non-financial support in variety of business areas, for example, in strategic planning and in obtaining additional financing. The value-adding of the VCs was found not to be merely vested in the VCs role in the investee 2 ̆ 019 s board of directors, as the VCs were found rather often to be in contact with their investee companies outside the board meetings. The valueadding profile of each VC type was found to differ somewhat from one another. Of all VC types, informal VCs were perceived to provide value-added the most and were the most active in other respects. The public sector VCs stood out as most active providers of indirect value-added through signaling, while private sector VCs were characterized by being actively involved in implementing proper corporate governance. As predicted, the perceived value-added was found to be greater when the relationship with between the CEO and the lead VC was close and there were no tensions inside the <b>investee</b> <b>company</b> resulting from the involvement of VC. The results showed also that short experience of the CEO in <b>investee</b> <b>company</b> 2 ̆ 019 s industry increased the perceived value-added...|$|E

The optimal stopping corresponds to finding an optimal timing of making the company public. The second problem is concerned with optimal dividend policy.

40|$|Moral Hazard and the Agency Costs thereof {{have long}} been {{accepted}} arguments in venture finance theory and have therefore long been accepted shortcomings in the venture capitalist / entrepreneur relationship. In psychological experiments  including economic  {{it has been shown}} that human beings prefer to act in a reciprocal manner that reduces any inequity in a relationship. Humans who expect to receive an unfair and inequitable position in a relationship, will take steps to rectify that position. Specifically, if a venture capitalist expects the entrepreneur to unfairly extract private benefits from the <b>investee</b> <b>company</b> post investment by the venture capitalist, then he or she will impose costly controls and monitoring mechanisms in place to prevent that. All relationships that impose controls and monitoring mechanisms are inefficient, as opposed to Advising the investee which draws upon the skills of the venture capitalist and is generally efficient. The venture capital industry is comprised of intelligent and professional people who can recognise inefficiency easily. Indeed, this is how they make poorly managed companies into profitable trade sales or IPOs. The online survey completed for this thesis poses questions that attempt to show that venture capitalists and entrepreneurs are not locked in an antagonistic relationship where each merely acts in a self interested way. This thesis concludes that venture capitalists and entrepreneurs do work in a reciprocal relationship recognising the substantial efficiency gains to be made by doing so...|$|E

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore the {{perceptions}} of: how Japanese financial firms (JFF) acquire and use company intellectual capital (IC) information in their common routine equity investment decisions, how this activity contributes to knowledge creation in the JFFs, and how <b>investee</b> <b>company</b> knowledge creation is affected by the JFFs. Design/methodology/approach – The research employed a multi-case design, using four JFF cases. The investigation was performed in terms of Nonaka and Toyama's “theory of the knowledge creating firm”. Findings – IC information contributed to earnings estimates and company valuation. Emotional information contributed to JFF feelings and confidence in their information use and valuation. JFF knowledge was an important component of the key interacting and informed contexts used by JFFs. This generated opportunities to improve disclosure and accountability between JFFs and their investee companies. Common patterns of behaviour across the JFFs were counterbalanced by variety and differences noted in JFF behaviour. Practical implications – The findings provide important insights into how JFF knowledge creating patterns could limit or progress a common language of communication between companies and markets on the subject of IC. This could impact on the quality of corporate disclosure and accountability processes. Originality/value – The paper demonstrates that there is a need for further use of qualitative studies of financial market behavior. Especially in the area of understanding the communication of IC between firms and financial markets, the potential of using sociology of finance approaches appears to be considerable...|$|E
40|$|While {{there exist}} {{consensus}} among researchers that business angels contribute with non-financial value to their investee companies, {{previous research on}} value adding activities has suffered {{from a lack of}} overview and consensus. This thesis seeks to create a general understanding of the value adding activities, how they are performed and what affects these activities. In addition we take the first step in assessing the process of realizing potential value adding, which has been indicated as a ‘black box’. Paper one is a literature study, while paper two is a multiple-case study including ten business angels where each candidate presented one or more investment cases resulting in a total of 15 business cases. Paper three is a conceptual theory-building study, which combine theoretical models from other disciplines with qualitative data from the multiple-case study Paper one conducts an extensive literature review on value adding activities performed by business angels to their <b>investee</b> <b>company,</b> in addition to explore which factors may influence these activities. We present a conceptual framework for value adding activities, and link this framework to potential factors. The findings suggest that the value adding activities may be divided between Intra-organizational activities, meaning the activities within the venture and Inter-organizational activities, meaning activities aimed at the external environment. Paper two explain how the value adding activities are performed to the <b>investee</b> <b>company.</b> We present an in-depth explanation regarding how the activities are performed, and also present a new framework for value adding activities in accordance with the findings. The findings support that value adding activities may be divided between Intra-organizational activities and Inter-organizational activities. However, in contrast to previous research, we find that Network and Legitimation are not direct activities, as Network may be seen as a channel in which Inter-organizational activities are performed, while Legitimation increases the value of this channel. Paper three assess what may influence the value adding activities. Findings suggest two major factors influencing the value adding activities; the ventures life cycle and the receptivity of the entrepreneur. We assess the Attributes of the investor, entrepreneur and company, and the Relational properties between them in the light of these two factors. In addition and stark contrast two previous research, we find that {{there is a difference between}} potential value added and realized value added, as this is a process contingent upon the entrepreneurs’ ability to acquire and exploit advice from the investor. Based on the findings we present a conceptual framework, which assesses the entire process from potential activities to realized value added. Combined, the papers presented in this thesis provide future researcher with a framework with which they may assess and analyze the non-financial contributions provided by business angels, in addition to factors influencing them. However, the main finding in paper three, which is the process of realizing potential value added, is of essence when assessing non-financial contributions. It should therefore be included in future studies on the subject, as this process needs to be fully understood in order to comprehend, and increase the efficiency of, the informal capital market. </p...|$|E
40|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} speculation recently regarding {{the effect of}} the growing prevalence of institutional investors in the equity markets on <b>investee</b> <b>company</b> behaviour. Institutional investors include superannuation funds, banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. It has been posited that the growth of institutional investors may lead to the pursuit of what is generally referred to in the human resource literature as ‘high commitment’ employment practices in investee companies. 1 This may be because institutional investors are using ‘voice’ mechanisms to pressure investee companies to adopt ‘high commitment’ human resource practices. For the purposes of our study it is sufficient to note that these labour management practices typically involve managerial attempts to motivate and manage workers through a series of workplace practices that incorporate the interests of employees rather than through strict command and control structures. 2 These might include investment in staff training and development, employment security, flexible workplace practices and self-directed work teams, investment in occupational health and safety, equitable remuneration, incentive pay, and ‘partnerships’ and consultation with employees and/or their representatives. In formal labour relations terms, it might also include respect for freedom of association, the right to bargain collectively and other core labour standards. The {{purpose of this study is}} to discover whether it is the intention of institutional investors to encourage investee companies to adopt ‘high commitment’ employment practices through case studies of twelve prominent institutional investors with funds invested in the Australian equities market and the Australian Council of Superannuation Investors (an industry body representing 39 superannuation funds) ...|$|E
