50|$|As {{the full}} company name (Rohrbach Metall-Flugzeugbau) makes clear, all Rohrbach {{aircraft}} were all-metal, including their duralumin skinning. The Robbe was a monoplane {{with a high}} wing described {{at the time as}} a semi-cantilever structure, meaning that there were no rigid wing struts but that it retained external bracing with flying wires to the wings from the lower fuselage. The wings were mounted with 5° of dihedral. In plan they were straight tapered, with unswept leading edges and blunt tips. Internally the wings were built around single box spars, assisted by leading edge and trailing <b>edge</b> <b>boxes.</b> The <b>edge</b> <b>boxes</b> also served as fuel tanks. At this time there were still doubts about the repairability of metal aircraft, so the Robbe's two-part wing was designed to be easy to inspect internally by the removal of the <b>edge</b> <b>boxes</b> and all parts were replaceable. The wing skin was riveted to the ribs.|$|R

40|$|Wind {{tunnel and}} flight tests have clearly {{demonstrated}} {{the potential of}} hybrid laminar flow control (HLFC) for drag reduction. Additional weight and costs of the suction system reduce {{the efficiency of the}} HLFC technology. Within the EC funded ALTTA programme a drastically simplified suction system has been proposed. Characteristic of this system is one single suction duct, the leading <b>edge</b> <b>box</b> itself, a double sheet suction surface with suction velocity control by orifices in the inner sheet and a constant speed suction pump directly with the leading <b>edge</b> <b>box.</b> The system is optimised for the design conditions of the aircraft at cruise. Investigations at design and off-design conditions reveal that the simplified system would operate as required within sufficient ranges of all parameters investigated...|$|R

It {{comprised}} a transverse trunnion <b>box</b> <b>member</b> at the front, from which six longitudinal tube members ran aftward and converged into one large main central tube at the rear; the six longitudinal members were braced vertically and horizontally by smaller-gauge tubes.

40|$|AbstractThe fiber model {{which is}} one kind of frame {{analysis}} methods is sometimes used as an effective tool for the nonlinear dynamic response analysis. Recently, some seismic evaluation methods based on the strain for evaluating the seismic performance of stiffened steel <b>box</b> <b>members</b> were proposed. However, it is reported that these previous methods based on the strain cannot adequately estimate the seismic performance. In this study, it is explained that the stress resultant can be little affected by hysteresis patterns and {{have the ability to}} be a good parameter in order to evaluate the seismic performance appropriately. In addition, a seismic evaluation method based on the stress resultant with the fiber model is proposed for evaluating the seismic performance of stiffened steel <b>box</b> <b>members.</b> Finally, the validity of the proposed method is confirmed for stiffened steel <b>box</b> <b>members</b> by comparing the calculation results by the proposed method with the experimental results and FEM analysis results...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Text binarisation process classifies {{individual}} pixels as text or {{background in}} the textual images. Binarization is necessary {{to bridge the gap}} between localization and recognition by OCR. This paper presents Sliding window method to binarise text from textual images with textured background. Suitable preprocessing techniques are applied first to increase the contrast of the image and blur the background noises due to textured background. Then Edges are detected by iterative thresholding. Subsequently formed <b>edge</b> <b>boxes</b> are analyzed to remove unwanted edges due to complex background and binarised by sliding window approach based character size uniformity check algorithm. The proposed method has been applied on localized region from heterogeneous textual images and compared with Otsu, Niblack methods and shown encouraging performance of the proposed method.

5000|$|The {{aircraft}} has two wings {{which can}} be dismounted for transport. The leading <b>edge</b> <b>box</b> consists of a spar and fibreglass leading edge, supplemented by an alloy rear strut. The wing profile is defined by preformed aluminum ribs. The trailing edge spar is laminated fiberglass. These three elements are interconnected by compression rods, cables and ribs, and ensure the shape and tension of the fabric coating for good aerodynamic efficiency. The coating is [...] "Bainbridge" [...] Dacron, 170 gr/m². Once in place on the fuselage, cables and a kingpost stay the two wings. [...] The fuselage and vertical fin are made of a fiberglass-polyester structure consisting of 2 half shells molded and stiffened by frames and smoothed to have a lightweight structure with an aerodynamic shape. Once completed they are assembled by gluing, which ensures rigidity.|$|R

The VP2 was a 4-door 4-seat car. The bodywork was still of aluminum and reflected the styling of the AFG, although neither Grégoire nor Bionier were entirely satisfied with it. Panhard may have been pressured to make the VP2 look like the AFG but they never acknowledged any {{connection between the two}} cars. Grégoire eventually sued Panhard for unpaid royalties. The VP2 went into production as the Panhard Dyna X.|$|R
