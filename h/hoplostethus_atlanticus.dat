ABSTRACT: Three {{species of}} the Trachichthyidae family occur {{in the south of}} Brazil: Paratrachichthys <b>atlanticus,</b> <b>Hoplostethus</b> occidentalis and Gephyroberyx darwinii. G. darwinii may attain a length of 600 mm (TL). This benthopelagic species occurs at depths down to 1210 m and is {{generally}} found in subtropical waters between 43 ºN and 35 ºS. It is commercially exploited in the east central Atlantic for food and for oil. In this paper we report the occurrence of G. darwinii off the south and south-east coasts of Brazil between Vila Velha (Espírito Santo State) and Rio Grande (Rio Grande do Sul State), in outer shelf and slope areas, at depths between 70 and 520 m. In Brazil the trachichthyids were usually caught while fishing for Lophius gastrophysus over deep coral bottoms. Meristic and biometric data are presented for the three collected specimens...|$|R

50|$|There {{has been}} a common {{understanding}} that wax esters are poorly absorbed by humans, partly due to outbreaks of the purgative effect named keriorrhea, associated with consumption of oilfish (Ruvettus pretiosus) and escolar (Lepdocybium flavobrunneum). Fillets from these fish species contain up to 20% fat, where 90% of the fat comes as wax esters, resulting in a typical intake of more than 30 g wax esters from one single meal. Orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> is an attractive food fish with 5,5% fat, where 90% of the fat comes as wax esters. Consumption of this fish gives no unpleasant adverse effects, most likely due to the relatively low fat content that provides approximately 10 g wax ester per 200 grams serving of fish.|$|E
5000|$|The orange roughy, red roughy, slimehead, or {{deep sea}} perch (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> is a {{relatively}} large deep-sea fish belonging to the slimehead family (Trachichthyidae). The UK Marine Conservation Society has categorized orange roughy as [...] "vulnerable to exploitation". It is found in 3 to 9 C, deep (bathypelagic, 180 to 1800 m) waters of the Western Pacific Ocean, eastern Atlantic Ocean (from Iceland to Morocco; and from Walvis Bay, Namibia, to off Durban, South Africa), Indo-Pacific (off New Zealand and Australia), and in the Eastern Pacific off Chile.The orange roughy is notable for its extraordinary lifespan, living for up to 149 years. It is important to commercial deep-trawl fisheries. The fish is a bright, brick-red color; fading to a yellowish-orange after death.|$|E
50|$|The Graveyard Knolls are {{a home to}} over 50 {{species of}} fish, {{dominated}} by the orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus),</b> black oreo (Allocyttus niger), and cardinalfish (Apogonidae).

A number of the seamounts are also home to extensive deep water coral forests, made up of Solenosmilia variabilis and Madrepora oculata, both species not known to be of wide extent near New Zealand until camera surveys of Graveyard Knolls in 2001 revealed their and extent. These forests offer a home to a diverse invertebrate community that includes squat lobsters, seastars, brittlestars, polychaete worms, and crabs.

40|$|The {{trophic ecology}} and food web {{dynamics}} of the mid-slope demersal fish community (700 - 1200 m) off southern Tasmania were investigated. The top predators in the community were orange roughy, the oreos and squalids. Orange roughy <b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus</b> is dominant on the flat ground but even more so on the seamounts, and consequently fishing has been intense on these seamounts. Oreos are also fished on the seamounts. During 10 research cruises around south-eastern Australia, more than 9000 stomachs from orange roughy and 23 other species were collected and examined. Orange roughy ate predominantly mesopelagic and benthopelagic fish, crustaceans and squid as adults, and mainly crustaceans as juveniles suggesting resource partitioning between juveniles and adults. Orange roughy, warty dory Allocyttus verrucosus, squalids and macrourids are benthopelagic omnivores. In contrast, the smooth oreo Pseudocyttus maculatus, and the alepocephalids ate pyrosomes.

The data indicate that post-larval orange roughy are mesopelagic active foragers, early juvenile fish move into a low energy deep-demersal phase, and older pre-recruit orange roughy assume the habitat depth and metabolic rate typical of adults. Comparison of otolith stable isotope profiles among areas and habitats on the Porcupine Bank suggest that juvenile orange roughy from South ‘hill ’ and ‘flat ’ habitats experience differing temperature and metabolic status at certain life stages.

Consequence matrices were developed to assess each of the five EoF categories. To illustrate the model, a 13 -y dataset of New Zealand fisheries catch-effort and observer data was analysed, using orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> as an example fishery.

40|$|A benthic {{community}} constituted by {{an assemblage of}} at least four species of deep-sea corals collected in only one trawl carried-out on {{the summit of the}} O'Higgins I seamount, central Chile. The corals were collected in only one trawl carried-out during a Chilean-Japanese cruise onboard the R/V" Koyo Maru" in December 29, 2004. Presence of oxygenated and cold Antarctic Intermediate Water (> 400 m depth) on the plateau was recorded under of the Equatorial Subsurface Water associated to the oxygen-minimum zone (OMZ, < 1 mL O 2 L- 1). The biogeographic origin of the fauna evidenced a mix of Subantarctic and central Chile continental margin species. The assemblage is represented by two species of anthipatarians (Leiopathes sp. and Chrysopathes sp.), one unidentified species of Paragorgiidae and one species of Isididae (Acanella chilensis). The study demonstrated that deep-water corals of the O'Higgins seamount provide crucial habitat for commercially important crustacean exploited along continental margin off central Chile such as nylon shrimp (Heterocarpus reedi). This resource as well as some fishes such as alfonsino (Beryx splendens) and orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> could drawing the commercial fishing industry to these fragile areas poorly known Chilean marine benthic communities.

40|$|Acoustic methodologies are {{important}} tools for monitoring deep-water fish {{and have the}} potential to provide high-precision estimates of aggregation size. However, they can be costly to design and implement for monitoring fish. Data from 2 years of scientific surveys of the spawning aggregations of orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus,</b> Collett, 1889) on the Cascade Plateau, Tasmania, collected using commercial fishing vessels and echosounders, were used to develop a cost-effective approach for estimating the size of deep-water aggregations. Criteria were developed to standardise the identification of orange roughy echo-traces from acoustic data from 23 surveys in 2001 and 19 in 2005. The spawning condition of the fish was monitored simultaneously with the acoustics in each year (n = 29 trawls each year). The volumes of the aggregations were estimated throughout the survey period. Although the precision of the estimated aggregation size is low, large amounts of data can be collected over extended periods by using this approach and the equipment on standard commercial fishing echosounders. Aggregation volumes varied markedly during each spawning season and changes in volume appear to be linked to the spawning biology. Monitoring the spawning biology, therefore, provides crucial complementary information for interpreting estimates of aggregation size from acoustic surveys...|$|E
40|$|Analysis {{of video}} {{recordings}} {{performed by the}} submersible “Nautile” in the Bay of Biscay, NE Atlantic indicated that demersal fish species are associated to different types of deep-sea habitats. Four different dive transects were analysed with respect to environmental characteristics. A total of 19 fish groups were ordinated by means of canonical correspondence analysis, and the investigation was performed at the individual fish level. Microhabitat fauna was dominated by a diversity of suspension feeders indicating different gradients of bottom hydrology, particularly vertical and horizontal current flow. Physical, geological and biological factors revealed different strategies of habitat selection in fish. The most represented species, the orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> showed a clear association with complex bottoms, including coral reefs. Others, such as Coryphaenoides rupestris and Synaphobranchus kaupi, showed higher flexibility of adjustment to changing environments. These traits can be utilised {{in the study of}} the environmental impact of deep-sea fishing. Based on the same dives, the locomotory behaviour of 13 fish species was studied with basis on a qualitative analysis of selected individuals. The main swimming modes used in shallow waters were also detected in the demersal environment. Clear differences in locomotory behaviour were found among fish species, reflecting both convergence and diversity of strategies of utilization of the demersal niche space...|$|E
40|$|Little {{is known}} about the {{ecological}} interactions between bycatch species and orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> within exploited slope and seamount communities off Tasmania. The diet of Etmopterus baxteri and E. unicolor, two important bycatch species of these fisheries, is described using four indices [percentage frequency of occurrence, percentage by number, percentage by weight, and percentage by the index of relative importance (%IRI) ] calculated for broad prey categories, individual prey taxa, and functional prey groups. The identifiable diet of E. unicolor was dominated by benthic cephalopods (96 %IRI), whereas benthic teleost prey, notably orange roughy (43 %IRI), dominated the diet of E. baxteri. Similar trophic mechanisms appear to support aggregations of orange roughy and Etmopterus spp. off Tasmania; they feed on demersal species and mesopelagic or vertically migrating nekton advected laterally onto the mid-slope. The importance of teleost prey in the diet of E. baxteri apparently increases with shark length, whereas crustaceans become less important, which is a similar diet shift to that of orange roughy. Etmopterus baxteri is both a potential competitor and predator of orange roughy in these ecosystems. Fishery managers need to understand and consider the complex trophic interactions between orange roughy, sharks, and other exploited species in managing recently reopened deep-water fisheries off southeastern Australia...|$|E
40|$|The Interim Measures for bottom {{fisheries}} {{adopted by the}} developing South Pacific RFMO require participants to limit bottom fishing to ‘currently fished areas’, and to prevent significant adverse impacts on vulnerable marine ecosystems in fished areas. The bottom trawl footprint mapped by New Zealand consists of 200 x 20 minute blocks trawled over the reference period 2002 - 2006, forming distinct fishing areas within which New Zealand flagged vessels reported 11, 425 tows, primarily targeting orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus).</b> Effort levels and levels of past seabed impact differ substantially within these blocks, ranging from ‘lightly’ trawled ( 50 tows / block), with a maximum of 1, 417 tows in the most heavily trawled block on the Challenger Plateau. Effort data were used to stratify the bottom trawl footprint into three effort tiers, each comprising about {{one third of the}} footprint. This effort stratification was used as the basis for implementation of three-tiered management measures tailored to levels of past effort and impact. 62 ‘lightly trawled ’ blocks were closed to prevent further impact in these areas. 69 ‘moderately trawled ’ blocks were made subject to a move-on rule to require vessels to identify and move away from fishing positions which produc...|$|E
40|$|Who do {{you trust}} when trying to make an {{informed}} and environmentally friendly choice on fish fillets at the supermarket? The Marine Stewardship Council and Forest and Bird have contradictory opinions {{when it comes to}} orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> sustainability. The controversy ultimately comes down to the fact that orange roughy is a deep sea species and while management may have been successful for inshore species, the vast number of unknowns relating to deep sea stocks and the ecosystem effects of deep sea fishing mean that what initially seemed like sustainable management repeatedly resulted in disastrous consequences. The collapse of some of the early orange roughy stocks is proof of this. The question is, have we learnt enough from those early failures to avoid repeating those mistakes, or is it {{only a matter of time}} before the next crash of one of our deep sea fisheries? Fitting a selection of linear models to catch per unit effort (CPUE) data, corresponding to orange roughy catch from the Priceless region in the Sub-Antarctic, led to the discovery of significant seasonal patterns and an annual linear trend in CPUE with a breakpoint in 2004. The assumed relationship between CPUE and abundance is difficult to quantify but the cessation of fishing in the region leads to the conclusion that decreases in CPUE correspond to decreases in orange roughy abundance...|$|E
40|$|Restriction enzyme {{analysis}} of mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) {{was used to}} test for genetic homogeneity of orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> in the southern hemisphere. Two hundred and eighty-six orange roughy specimens were collected from seven general localities: the Great Australian Bight; South Australia (off southeastern Kangaroo Island); the west coast of Tasmania; the east coast of Tasmania; New South Wales; New Zealand and South Africa. Mitochondrial DNA was extracted from developing ovary tissue and analysed with 10 six-base enzymes and 3 four-base enzymes. Both forms of analysis revealed a low level of genetic diversity in this species. The six-base enzyme study found no evidence of reproductively isolated populations of orange roughy in southeastern Australian waters. However, an {{analysis of}} 107 fish with 3 four-base enzymes identified at least partial genetic separation of the New South Wales (NSW) sample of orange roughy from South Australian (off southeastern Kangaroo Island) and Tasmanian samples. This finding supports biological evidence for the presence of a distinct subpopulation of orange roughy in NSW waters. The four-base study also provided evidence of the presence of genetically distinct samples of orange roughy occurring in the same localities off southeastern Kangaroo Island from consecutive years. Additional sampling and the use of a greater number of four-base enzymes may be needed to determine if any genetic structuring exists among orange roughy south of New South Wales...|$|E
40|$|Microsatellite and otolith {{chemistry}} variability were analysed {{to assess}} fine scale genetic {{structure in the}} deep-sea teleost orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus).</b> The Porcupine Bank located on the continental shelf west of Ireland, comprises a complex system of mounds and flat areas that are broken up by canyons. Orange roughy form spawning aggregations on mounds and flat areas, and were heavily fished until the resource was depleted. By analysing adults in spawning condition and juvenile orange roughy from six mounds and one flat area, shallow but significant genetic population structure was evident (FST= 0. 0031, Dest across loci= 0. 0306 and G-test). Most of the structure was accounted for by inclusion of a sample from the flats (six of ten significant pairwise FST estimates and G-tests, and five of the highest Dest estimates included the flat sample). While the flat sample contributed most to the genetic structure, there was still significant (albeit weaker) structure among mound samples. The observed structure was supported by otolith analyses. Fish caught as late juveniles in either the flat or mound areas showed consistent differences in chemistry at the otolith core throughout the initial 10 years of growth, which could indicate site fidelity. We hypothesise that seafloor topographic structures (mounds and flats) may provide discrete spawning areas for orange roughy and that the limited gene flow between these spawning areas is insufficient to counteract genetic drift...|$|E
40|$|We review {{information}} from scientific trawl surveys carried out between 1977 and 2002 in the Porcupine Seabight and Abyssal Plain {{area of the}} Northeast Atlantic (240 - 4865 m water depth). Since the late 1980 s, commercial bottom-trawl fisheries targeting mainly roundnose grenadier (Coryphaenoides rupestris), black scabbardfish (Aphanopus carbo), and orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> have been operating at depths of 500 - 1500 m, intersecting the depth ranges of 77 demersal fish species that would therefore be vulnerable to fishery effects. Comparisons of trawls pre- 1989 and post- 1997 indicate {{a significant decrease in}} total abundance of demersal fish down to 2500 m. Detailed analyses of the 15 most-abundant species showed that nine species with depth ranges within the commercial fishing depth have decreased in abundance. Other species were either not affected (Bathypterois dubius) or only affected at the shallow end of their range (Coryphaenoides guentheri). Species with a minimum depth of occurrence > 1500 m (Coryphaenoides armatus and Coryphaenoides leptolepis) increased in abundance over part of their depth range. Decreases in abundance are probably caused by commercial fishing activities, an effect that is transmitted downslope by removal of fish at the shallow end of their depth range, resulting in declines at the deeper end of the depth range. The estimated fishery area is ca. 52 000 km(2), but the potential impact probably extends to ca. 142 000 km(2) and to many non-target species...|$|E
40|$|We {{evaluate}} hypotheses for meso-scale {{spatial structure}} in an orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus)</b> stock using samples collected during research trawl surveys off {{the east coast}} of New Zealand. Distance-based linear models and generalised additive models were used to identify the most significant biological, environmental, and temporal predictors of variability in diet, proportion of stomachs containing prey, standardised weight of prey, fish somatic weight, fish total weight, and reproductive activity. The diet was similar to that observed elsewhere, and varied with ontogeny, depth, and surface water temperature. Smaller sized and female orange roughy in warmer bottom water were most likely to contain food. Fish condition and reproductive activity were highest at distances more than 20 km from the summit of the hills. Trawl survey catches indicated greater orange roughy densities in hill strata, suggesting hill habitat was favoured. However, analyses of feeding, condition, and reproductive activity indicated hill fish were not superior, despite fish densities on hills being reduced by fishing which, in principle, should have reduced intra-specific competition for food and other resources. Hypotheses for this result include: (1) fish in relatively poor condition visit hills to feed and regain condition and then leave, or (2) commercial fishing has disturbed feeding aggregations and/or caused habitat damage, making fished hills less productive. Mature orange roughy were observed on both flat and hill habitat during periods outside of spawning, and if this spatial structure was persistent then a proportion of the total spawning stock biomass would remain unavailable t...|$|E

Wax esters are stored extracellu-larly in certain fishes, such as the orange roughy (<b>Hoplostethus</b> <b>atlanticus),</b> and therefore buoyancy appears to be their sole function. Some myctophid fishes have wax-invested swimbladders, where the non-compressible wax esters may aid in diurnal vertical migration, by replacing compressible swimbladder gases. Squalene is metabolically inert in the livers of certain sharks, and therefore probably has buoyancy as its only function. Alkyldiacylglycerols (DAGE) are abundant com-ponents of liver oil of certain deep sea sharks and holocephalans, where they may {{have an important role}} in buoyancy. Triacylglycerols and cholesterol are lipids {{that have a}}n indirect role in buoyancy of marine fish. Many fishes in the ocean have oil-filled bones (mostly triacylglycerols). Although this oil aids buoyancy, its major function is as an energy storage lipid which can be utilized during starva-tion. Cholesterol, which is found in high amounts in the lipid-rich membranes of the swimbladder of deep sea fishes, may aid buoyancy by combining with oxygen gas in the swimbladder membranes to facilitate gas secretion in fish at great depths in the ocean. Further research is needed to understand the physical state of lipids, such as wax esters at deep sea temperatures and pressures, and more evidence is needed to clarify the role of cholesterol-rich membranes in swimbladders of deep sea fishes...|$|E
