40|$|Abstract. A grid tantahun {{filament}} of {{a dimension}} of 3 X 4 cm 2 was used for diamond synthesis by hot-filament assisted chemical vapour deposition (HFCVD). After proper carburization, the filament {{could be used for}} multi-cycles of deposition. By heating the filament to 2400 OC in 8 % CH 4 mixed with H 2. diamond has been deposited at rate of about 5 p / h o u r on (100) oriented silicon substrate placed 5 mm away from the filament. By X-ray diffraction (XRD), the stn~cture of the films deposited in the mixture of CH 4 and H 2 was characterized as diamond, while tantalum oxide was fotmd in the presence of oxygen during deposition. The deposited diamond appeared uniform over an area of 2 X 3 an 2 observed by scanning electron miaoscopy (SEM) perhaps due to the stable filament geometry.

40|$|In an {{extension}} of Fischera & Martin (2012 a) and Heitsch (2013), two aspects {{of the evolution of}} externally pressurized, hydrostatic filaments are discussed. (a) The free-fall accretion of gas onto such a filament will lead to filament parameters (specifically, FWHM [...] column density relations) inconsistent with the observations of Arzoumanian et al. (2011), except for two cases: For low-mass, isothermal filaments, agreement is found as in the analysis by Fischera & Martin (2012 b). Magnetized cases, for which the field scales weakly with the density as B∝ n^ 1 / 2, also reproduce observed parameters. (b) Realistically, the filaments will be embedded not only in gas of non-zero pressure, but also of non-zero density. Thus, the appearance of sheet-embedded filaments is explored. Generating a <b>grid</b> of <b>filament</b> models and comparing the resulting column density ratios and profile shapes with observations suggests that the three-dimensional filament profiles are intrinsically flatter than isothermal, beyond projection and evolution effects.

40|$|This paper {{select the}} {{topology}} {{of the power}} supplies to the RF power amplifier to one spoke cavity to be tested at FREIA Uppsala University. The power supplies are thought {{to fulfill the requirements}} of ESS in Lund. The amplifiers pulsed operation will have a strong impact of the choice of topology. The RF amplifier will have two tetrodes in the final stage. The anode power supply is studied for different topologies and number of anodes to supply. Storing the energy for pulse current to the anodes at high voltage or at low voltage is considered. The short circuit protection can be with a crowbar or a series switch. The series switch is selected for reasons of short interrupts in case of temporary short circuits. The <b>grid</b> and <b>filament</b> supplies are thought to be standard of the shelf power supplies.

40|$|Electron curtain {{accelerator}} {{is a type}} of low-energy electron accelerator, {{which plays}} an important role in many different industries such as printing, coating and packing to promote product quality, while reducing volatile organic compounds for protecting global environment. Electron emitter is one of the main components of this type of accelerators. Multi-filament cathodes and <b>grid</b> structures within <b>filament</b> housing have been designed carefully to generate uniform broad beam distribution. Compared to single filament  cathode, multi-filament cathodes are more preferred in width expansion and beam uniformity. Distortion of linear filament due to thermal expansion is one of the major problems in this type of electron source. The aim of this study is to design and fabricate an appropriate mechanical system to maintain the filament in its initial shape and position when heating. In addition, dependence of emitted electrons on anode voltage (at constant cathode temperature), as well as dependence of emitted electrons on filament current (at constant anode voltage) have been experimentally investigated.    ...|$|R

5000|$|The first {{vacuum tube}} used in radio was the {{thermionic}} diode or Fleming valve, invented by John Ambrose Fleming in 1904 as a detector for radio receivers. It was an evacuated glass bulb containing two electrodes, a heated filament {{and a plate}} (anode). Triodes came about in 1906 when American engineer Lee De Forest and Austrian physicist Robert von Lieben independently patented tubes that added a third electrode, a <b>grid</b> between the <b>filament</b> and plate to control current. von Lieben's partially-evacuated three-element tube, patented in March 1906, contained a trace of mercury vapor and was intended to amplify weak telephone signals. Starting in October 1906 De Forest patented a number of three-element tube designs by adding an electrode to the diode, which he called Audions, intended {{to be used as}} radio detectors. The one which became the design of the triode, in which the grid was located between the filament and plate, was patented January 29, 1907. Like the von Lieben vacuum tube, De Forest's Audions were incompletely evacuated and contained some gas at low pressure. [...] von Lieben's vacuum tube did not see much development due to his death 7 years after he invented it at the outbreak of World War I.|$|R
40|$|Miniature ion {{thrusters}} {{are well}} suited for future space missions that require high efficiency, precision thrust, and low contamination in the mN to sub-mN range. JPL’s miniature xenon Ion (MiXI) thruster has demonstrated an efficient discharge and ion extraction <b>grid</b> assembly using <b>filament</b> cathodes and the internal conduction (IC) cathode. JPL is currently preparing to incorporate a miniature hollow cathode for the MiXI discharge. Computational analyses anticipate that an axially upstream hollow cathode location provides the most favorable performance and beam profile; however, the hot surfaces of the hollow cathode must be sufficiently downstream to avoid demagnetization of the cathode magnet {{at the back of}} the chamber, which can significantly reduce discharge performance. MiXI’s ion extraction grids are designed to provide > 3 mN of thrust; however, previous to this effort, the low-thrust characteristics had not been investigated. Experimental results obtained with the MiXI-II thruster (a near replica or the original MiXI thruster) show that sparse average discharge plasma densities of ∼ 5 × 10 ^ 15 – 5 × 10 ^ 16 m^− 3 allow the use of very low beamlet focusing extraction voltages of only ∼ 250 – 500 V, thus providing thrust levels as low as 0. 03 mN for focused beamlet conditions. Consequently, the thrust range thus far demonstrated by MiXI in this and other tests is 0. 03 – 1. 54 mN...|$|R
40|$|Purpose - To {{study the}} {{magnetic}} shielding of buried high-voltage (HV) cables by adding conductive metal plates {{on the ground}} surface above the cables. Design/methodology/approach - The field is calculated with eight rectangular conductive plates above the cables, positioned with their long edge either parallel to the cables or transversal to the cables. Here, the circuit method is used. In this method, the shield {{is replaced by a}} <b>grid</b> of straight <b>filaments</b> in which the unknown currents are searched by solving an electrical circuit. Findings - It is observed from the calculation results {{that it is important to}} have a perfect electrical connection between adjacent plates. In the area above the shield, an "infinite" contact resistance between neighbouring plates results roughly in double field amplitude compared to the situation with contact resistance zero. The positioning of the rectangular plates (parallel or transversal to the cables) has not much influence on the shielding. The shielding efficiency as a function of the shield size is studied as well. The circuit method is validated by measurements on an experimental setup at reduced scale. Research limitations/implications - The circuit method is applied to conductive objects and not to ferromagnetic objects. Practical implications - As the circuit method is rather fast also for 3 D geometries with thin plates, the shielding of HV cables can be evaluated in a computationally more efficient way than by using, e. g. finite elements. Originality/value - The circuit method is already described in the literature. The originality of this paper is the study - by this circuit method - of the effect of several parameters (size of the shield, contact resistance, orientation of the plates) on the shielding efficiency...|$|R
40|$|Here {{we present}} {{evidence}} that {{strongly suggests that}} the well- documented phenomenon of A-band shortening in Limulus telson muscle is activation dependent and reflects fragmentation of thick filaments at their ends. Calcium activation of detergent-skinned fiber bundles of Limulus telson muscle results in large decreases in A-band (from 5. 1 to 3. 3 microns) and thick filament (from 4. 1 to 3. 3 microns) lengths {{and the release of}} filament end fragments. In activated fibers, maintained stretched beyond overlap of thick and thin filaments, these end fragments are translocated to varying depths within the I-bands. Here they are closely associated with fine filamentous structures that also span the gap between A- and I-bands and attach to the distal one-third of the thick filaments. End-fragments are rarely, if ever, present in similarly stretched and skinned, but unstimulated fibers, although fine "gap filaments" persist. Negatively stained thick filaments, separated from skinned, calcium-activated, fiber bundles, allowed to shorten freely, are significantly shorter than those obtained from unstimulated fibers, but are identical to the latter with respect to both the surface helical array of myosin heads and diameters. Many end-fragments are present on <b>grids</b> containing thick <b>filaments</b> from activated fibers; few, if any, on those from unstimulated fibers. SDS-PAGE shows no evidence of proteolysis due to activation and demonstrates the presence of polypeptides with very high molecular weights in the preparations. We suggest that thick filament shortening {{is a direct result of}} activation in Limulus telson muscle and that it occurs largely by breakage within a defined distal region of each polar half of the filament. It is possible that at least some of the fine "gap filaments" are composed of a titin-like protein. They may move the activation- produced, fragmented ends of thick filaments to which they attach, into the I-bands by elastic recoil, in highly stretched fibers...|$|R
40|$|Method {{of testing}} {{equivalence}} of a mechanically osciallted charge to an alternating current. —The apparatus {{consisted of a}} cylinder approximately 4 inches in diameter by 9 inches long, constructed of insulating material, but coated on the out-side with a thin sheet of copper foil which could be charged to potentials which varied from 1400 to 2600 volts. The cylinder was arranged to oscillate around its axis at frequencies {{in the neighborhood of}} 20 cycles per second through an amplitude of something over 180 °. It was surrounded by an "effect coil," having 260, 772 turns of fine wire, which was connected through a three-stage amplifier with a tuned vibration galvanometer for detecting the electromotive force which would presumably be induced by the oscillation of the charged cylinder. The "effect coil" was shielded by a grounded covering of sheet copper, the inner portion of this covering and the coating of copper foil on the cylinder thus forming the two plates of an electrostatic condenser. Connected in series with the "effect coil" was a similar "compensating coil" having the same number of turns but connected in opposition so as to neutralize the effect of external magnetic disturbances. The electromotive force induced in the "effect coil" was measured by balancing out {{with the help of an}} auxiliary current flowing in a current sheet in such a way as to induce an opposing electromotive force in the "compensating coil," this auxiliary current having the same frequency as the electromotive force to be balanced and being adjustable as to phase and amplitude. The apparatus was calibrated by replacing the charged oscillating cylinder by a current sheet of known dimensions and carrying a known current. Accidental effects coming from a number of sources were studied and as far as possible reduced or eliminated. Results of the test and conclusions. —A total of 64 effect runs were made, together with the necessary blank runs for correcting for the small residual effect. The runs were made in 16 different groups of 4 runs each under a given set of conditions. The changes in conditions consisted in changes in the sign and magnitude of the potential applied to the cylinder, changes in the method of connecting the "effect coil" and "compensating coil" to the <b>grid</b> and <b>filament</b> of the amplifier, changes in the neutral position around which the cylinder was oscillated, and change to a different frequency of oscillation. The phase of the effect obtained depended on the conditions of operation in the way predicted by theory. It was changed through 180 ° by a reversal of the sign of the applied potential, depended on the connections used and on the frequency of oscillation in the manner predicted from the calibration runs, and was independent of the neutral position around which the cylinder was oscillated. The magnitude of the effect obtained was also in agreement with theory. It was closely proportional to the potential applied to the cylinder and to the velocity of motion of the cylinder, and had very approximately the absolute value predicted from the measured capacity of the cylinder, the applied potential and the velocity of motion. The result of the experiment is to show that a mechanically oscillated electrostatic charge of electricity surrounds itself with an alternating magnetic field, accompanied at right angles by an alternating electric field capable of producing an alternating electromotive force in a suitably placed secondary. It further shows that at right angles to both the magnetic and electric fields there must be a Poynting-vector field corresponding to the observed transmission of energy to the secondary, and that these quantities all have the magnitude and time dependence predicted by electromagnetic theory. The present experiment must be regarded as testing a more extended portion of the fundamental basis of electromagnetic theory than the original Rowland experiment, and as giving a more clear-cut demonstration of the equivalence of a mechanically oscillated charge of electricity to an ordinary alternating current than have previous experiments...|$|R
