5|$|In August 1907, MacArthur {{was sent}} to the {{engineer}} district office in Milwaukee, where his parents were living. In April 1908, he was posted to Fort Leavenworth, where he was given his first command, Company K, 3rd Engineer Battalion. He became battalion adjutant in 1909 and then engineer officer at Fort Leavenworth in 1910. MacArthur was promoted to captain in February 1911 and was appointed as head of the Military Engineering Department and the <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> School. He participated in exercises at San Antonio, Texas, with the Maneuver Division in 1911 and served in Panama on detached duty in January and February 1912. The sudden death of their father on 5 September 1912 brought Douglas and his brother Arthur back to Milwaukee to care for their mother, whose health had deteriorated. MacArthur requested a transfer to Washington, D.C. so his mother could be near Johns Hopkins Hospital. Army Chief of Staff, Major General Leonard Wood, took up the matter with Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, who arranged for MacArthur to be posted to the Office of the Chief of Staff in 1912.|$|E
5|$|Yet despite {{significant}} reorganisations of the post-Federation Army in 1903 and 1906, the force-in-being {{was increasingly}} seen as dysfunctional and inadequate, suffering from perceived institutional problems regarding structure, command, and administration, {{as well as}} limited financial resources, lack of modern equipment, and poor training. In time this led the government to decide to adopt an entirely new military system. In 1911, two significant changes followed a report by Lord Kitchener following his inspection of local forces in 1909. The Royal Military College, Duntroon was established to train staff officers, and a system of universal national service began with boys aged 12 to 18 becoming cadets, and men aged 18 to 26 serving in the Citizen Forces. These reforms {{were part of a}} process of raising a large civilian militia to defend the country against a feared attack by Japan. This force was based on conscription, and was intended to be complete in 1920. The resources devoted to this plan greatly exceeded those allocated to preparations to raise an expeditionary force to serve outside Australia. In total, a peace-time force of around 80,000 citizen soldiers, with a war-time establishment of 135,000, was to be raised and would include 84 infantry battalions (later increased to 92), 28 light horse regiments (subsequently raised to 31), 49 field batteries and seven howitzer batteries (total of 224 guns), 14 <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> companies, seven communication companies, and various support troops.|$|E
25|$|In 1957, 132 <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> Regiment was redesignated a Corps Engineer Regiment, but in 1961 it was disbanded and the {{remnants}} absorbed into 233 Squadron of 105 (TEE) Regiment.|$|E
50|$|In the past, many <b>Field</b> <b>Engineers</b> {{suffered}} backbone problems due to {{the need}} to carry heavy equipment.

25|$|Nicholson was {{promoted}} {{to the rank of}} captain on 16 March 1878, and posted to Afghanistan, seeing service in the Second Anglo-Afghan War. He served in the first campaign as <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Kandahar Field Force from 10 October 1878 to 5 March 1879, and as Royal Engineers Commander for the Thal-Chotiali Field Force from 6 March to 30 April 1879. During the second campaign of the war he served first as <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer,</b> 1st Division, Kabul Field Force from 23 September 1879 until 7 August 1880, being present at the action near Surkai Kotal on 14 October 1879, the defence of the Shutargardan in October 1879 and the defence of the Lataband in December 1879. He then served as <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer,</b> Kabul-Kandahar Field Force, taking part in the advance to the relief of Kandahar, and being present at the Battle of Kandahar. During the Afghanistan campaigns, he was three times mentioned in despatches, was awarded a campaign medal with three clasps, and promoted to the brevet rank of major.|$|E

25|$|Two New Zealand <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> {{companies}} (the 20th and 26th) {{were also}} {{sent to the}} island following the commitment of New Zealand troops. These worked alongside the Americans to improve roads and constructed several bridges. The last of the US naval construction battalions left Vella Lavella in January 1944, and responsibility for the installations on Vella Lavella passed to the 502nd Construction Battalion Maintenance Unit (CBMU). Salvage operations commenced in May 1944, and the airstrip was abandoned on 15 June 1944. The final task was dismantlement of the tank farm. The 502nd CBMU then departed for Emirau on 12 July 1944.|$|E

40|$|This chapter {{considers}} {{the provision of}} mobile computing support for <b>field</b> <b>engineers</b> in the electricity industry. Section 11. 2 describes <b>field</b> <b>engineers</b> current working practices and from these derives a set of general requirements for a mobile computing environment to support utilities workers. A key requirement which is identified {{is the need for}} <b>field</b> <b>engineers</b> to access real-time multimedia information in the field and it is on this requirement that the remainder of the chapter focuses. Sections 11. 3 and 11. 4 present a survey of enabling technologies to support distributed systems operating in both local and wide area wireless environments. The impact of these technologies on the provision of mobile computing support is assessed in section 11. 5. Section 11. 6 describes a software architecture which attempts to address the requirements highlighted in section 11. 2 and in particular is designed to support real-time access to data in the field. Finally, section 11. 7 {{considers the}} degree to which utilities workers requirements can be met by the surveyed technologies and considers the likely impact of remote data access on <b>field</b> <b>engineers</b> working practices...|$|R
25|$|The {{decade of}} the 1970s saw {{the demise of the}} {{squadron}} as the RAE was reorganised around a regimental structure. In February 1972, it was renamed the 17th Field Squadron, as part of 2nd <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> Regiment, based at Enoggera. While part of the regiment, the squadron completed construction works in Tully as part of the regiment's involvement supporting the Medium Tank Trials Unit. Public relations projects were also undertaken including work on Tully hospital, schools, golf and bowling clubs. In mid-1973, 17th Field Squadron merged with 7th Field Squadron, and the unit's designation fell off the Royal Australian Engineers Order of Battle. The unit remained disbanded until 1977.|$|E
25|$|When the TA was reconstituted in 1947, 50th Divisional RE was {{reformed}} as 103 <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> Regiment, RE, with 232, 235 and 506 {{companies now}} designated as squadrons. When the division was reorganised as a division/district command in 1961, 103 Regiment was broken up, but 232 and 506 Field Squadrons and 235 Field Park Squadron {{continued to be}} assigned to the divisional HQ. A major reorganisation in 1967 saw the division/district disbanded, and its RE component reformed as HQ Squadron and 103 Field Squadron of 72 Engineer Regiment. The remainder of 72 Engineer Regiment was formed by the lineal descendants of the Tyne Electrical Engineers, thus uniting the lineages of all the Newcastle and Durham Engineer Volunteers of 1860 and 1874).|$|E
25|$|In August 1977, the 17th Construction Squadron was re-raised at Gallipoli Lines, Holsworthy Barracks, {{as part of}} the 1st Construction Regiment. Upon establishment, {{the unit}} was placed under the command of Major John Koek. The squadron's first task saw it sent to Nowra, where it was tasked with {{constructing}} fuel storage tanks for the Royal Australian Navy. In addition to this, the squadron worked to restore the accommodation buildings that it had been assigned. Having established itself, during {{the first six months of}} 1978 the squadron completed a number of small construction tasks for surrounding units in the Holsworthy area, including new facilities for the 1st <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> Regiment. An annual camp was also held at Gosper, New South Wales. In 1979, the 17th Construction Squadron was placed on stand-by for service in Namibia.|$|E

25|$|In the 1860s, San Franciscans {{began to}} feel {{the need for a}} spacious public park similar to Central Park, which was then taking shape in New York City. Golden Gate Park was carved out of unpromising sand and shore dunes that were known as the Outside Lands, in an unincorporated area west of San Francisco‚Äôs then-current borders. Conceived ostensibly for recreation, the {{underlying}} purpose of the park was housing development and the westward expansion of the city. The tireless <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> William Hammond Hall prepared a survey and topographic map of the park site in 1870 and became its commissioner in 1871. He was later named California's first state engineer and developed an integrated flood control system for the Sacramento Valley. The park drew its name from nearby Golden Gate Strait.|$|E

2500|$|Two years later, further change {{occurred}} when 201 Works Section was redesignated 4 Troop, underneath the 5th Field Squadron, which {{was part of}} the 4th <b>Field</b> <b>Engineer</b> Regiment. [...] This lasted until early 1980 when the subunit returned to the 21st Construction Regiment and once again became 201 Works Section. [...] In 1987, the regiment was placed under the command of the 2nd Divisional Engineers. Later that year, the 103rd and 108th Plant Squadrons were disbanded and reformed as the 26th Divisional Engineer Support Squadron.

2500|$|In 1938, with {{significant}} new supporting evidence, {{it was reported}} {{on the pages of}} Popular Science Monthly that the human vocal cords function like a fire siren to produce a harmonic-rich tone, which is then filtered by the vocal tract to produce different vowel tones. By the time, the additive Hammond organ was already on market. Most early electronic organ makers thought it too expensive to manufacture the plurality of oscillators required by additive organs, and began instead to build subtractive ones. In a 1940 Institute of Radio Engineers meeting, the head <b>field</b> <b>engineer</b> of Hammond elaborated on the company's new Novachord as having a ‚Äúsubtractive system‚Äù in contrast to the original Hammond organ in which ‚Äúthe final tones were built up by combining sound waves‚Äù. Alan Douglas used the qualifiers additive and subtractive to describe different types of electronic organs in a 1948 paper presented to the Royal Musical Association. [...] The contemporary wording additive synthesis and subtractive synthesis can be found in his 1957 book The electrical production of music, in which he categorically lists three methods of forming of musical tone-colours, in sections titled Additive synthesis, Subtractive synthesis, and Other forms of combinations.|$|E
