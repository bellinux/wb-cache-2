50|$|The FFC {{was officially}} opened on 21 April 2009 in London by Environment Minister Hilary Benn. Its {{role is to}} provide better advice to governments, local authorities, {{emergency}} responders {{and the general public}} via its parent organisations. It faced its first major test in November 2009 when severe flooding affected Northern England, in particular Cumbria and the town of Cockermouth. The Pitt Review progress report highlighted the accuracy of the advice issued ahead of this event. In April 2011 the FFC moved from central London to a permanent base within the Operations Centre at the Met Office HQ in Exeter. It currently provides a range of operational <b>Hydrometeorology</b> <b>services</b> across England and Wales and limited services for Scotland and Northern Ireland.|$|E
40|$|Water resources, {{particularly}} in arid and semi-arid {{regions of the}} world are of great concern, as they are closely linked to the wellbeing of humankind. Sophisticated hydrological prediction tools are required to assess climatic and hydrometeorological conditions, as they impact the sustainability of water resources as well as water availability. Research and data collection activities from multi-hydrometeorological sensors (e. g., gauges, radars, satellites) form the basis for quantifying the impact of extreme episodes along the hydrologic phases that manifest in terms of the magnitude, duration and frequency of floods, droughts and other hydrometeorological hazards that affect water resources management. A number of hydrometeorological research activities {{have been reported in the}} literature by various researchers and research groups globally. This contribution presents (a) a review of the hydrometeorology resource landscape in South Africa; (b) an analysis of the <b>hydrometeorology</b> <b>services</b> and products in South Africa; (c) a review of the hydrometeorological research that has been conducted in South Africa for the last four decades; and (d) highlights on some of the challenges facing the sustained advancement of research in hydrometeorology in South Africa.

40|$|A first {{approximate}} rainfall estimation using infrared (11 -µm) {{satellite imagery}} {{was carried out}} using two algorithms evaluated for the United States: The Auto-Estimator, using data adjusted by an exponential equation; and the GOES Multispectral Rainfall Algorithm (GMSRA), using values adjusted by a quadratic equation, from which, although all five channels were used {{to carry out the}} flow evaluation, only the infrared channel values were used. Calibration data was produced from the estimated values of these algorithms and observations were carried out hourly at the automatic stations of the National <b>Hydrometeorology</b> <b>Service</b> of Peru (SENAMHI). The evaluation was carried out during August and September 2001. The main objective of this work is that of evaluating the methods of estimating rainfall and determining the best way of adjusting them to our conditions...|$|R
40|$|A {{number of}} {{developments}} {{over the past}} decade or so illustrate the increasing salience of environmental problems for Soviet policy makers. In the mid- 1960 s, controversy over the potential pollution of Lake Baikal appears to have stimulated and legitimized environmental protection as an issue for discussion in the Soviet press. The output of scholarly books and articles by philosophers, economists, biologists, physicists, and sociologists reflects the broad range of organizations concerned with these questions. Support is also evident in high places-Brezhnev 2 ̆ 7 s report to the 25 th Party Congress in 1976 emphasized the importance of environmental protection and announced that 11 billion rubles would be allocated for the purpose during the tenth five-year plan. 3 N. K. Baibakov, Chairman of the State Planning Committee recently outlined planned capital investments of 1. 8 billion rubles for the implementation of environmental protection measures in 1981. 4 Greater organizational commitment is evident in the elevation of the former <b>Hydrometeorology</b> <b>Service</b> attached to the Council of Ministers to a State Committee on Hydrometeorology and Oversight of the Environment. The committee 2 ̆ 7 s director, Dr. Iu. Izrael, claimed his organization had approximately 10, 000 personnel working on environmental problems as of early 1979...|$|R
40|$|Extreme event - natural, ecological, {{social or}} {{technical}} event which cause danger {{to people and}} their property. The most usual extreme events {{can be caused by}} nature. Their strength and frequency often depends on the geographical location and global warming. It is important to assess their regularity, size, recurrence in order to avoid or defend from them in the future. This research of extreme event is focused on extreme precipitation. Data is provided by Lithuania <b>hydrometeorology</b> <b>service</b> for time period of 1961 and 2016. According to criteria of extreme events the extreme precipitation is defined as heavy rain which accumulates 50 mm or more in specific area during 12 hours time interval. Firstly, analysis was done for numbers of extreme events during a year period. In order to analyse the data, the following discrete distributions were used: geometric, Poisson, negative binomial discrete and uniform. The most accurate data distribution was found to be geometric. In research of extreme precipitation amount the following extreme values distributions were used: Weibull, Gumbеl and Generalized Extreme Value (GEV). Selection of distribution was done by applying different nonparametric methods, Chi square and other criteria. During the research, {{it was found that the}} best distribution for the data is GEV distribution. Then, using this distribution the frequencies and return periods of extreme events were estimated and confidence intervals of these estimates were calculated. Using Gumbеl, Wеibull and GEV distributions for 80 mm or higher amount of precipitation event per year the estimated frequency is: 1, 00; 0, 76; 0, 63. Using GEV distibution the return period of such event is 2, 35 years. The return period of observed anomaly, i. e. 250 mm amount of precipitation, using GEV distribution is 135 years. Calculations were made by using MS Еxcеl software, CumFrеq, ЕаsyFit, MАTLА...|$|R
