5000|$|Bill JacksonPhotographer, {{conceptual}} and installation artist. [...] Jackson’s artworks are elemental recordings, the conditions forming an intrinsic {{part of the}} process. John Cage talked about the accident or mistake in creating art. Jackson owns the accident, {{it is very much}} a part of what he does. Meticulously planning his work, he makes all decisions before choosing and setting up the event. Jackson’s ethos echoes that of Sol LeWitt [...] Jackson works with this predetermination or pre visualisation. The concept of time is crucial to his ideas and he employs photography as a tool to explore notions of time and space, exchanging the classic definition of photography as a series of instant glimpses of the world in which we live, to a personal definition of ‘space time’. The combination of art and science as photography is a means to an end rather than the end itself. North Sea Drawings, East Wind Drawings and In Search of Gretel are created on location. He creates a field of vision for the light drawings to take place. The unknown is the outcome. The photograph is the evidence of an 'event' that has taken place, a 'performance' that even Jackson himself cannot see in its entirety. During creation, only the process is evident. It’s through the inherent values in photography as a <b>documentary</b> <b>process</b> that he realises the idea. Influenced by Pollock's approach in random mark making and the artists intervention in that process, Jackson builds a platform for these events to take place. The landscapes are carefully considered and researched by daylight prior to any 'performance', they are then transformed by the night. A conceptualist arts education in the early 70's at Coventry School Of Art continues to inform his thinking and work practice. Drawing or mark making in its widest interpretation is integral to Jackson’s work. The mark, as an engineering drawing or a mathematical notation, is the beginning of the journey to new ideas. [...] In 1986 Jackson transitioned from photography and went into cyberspace, initially experimenting with early digital formats, combining them with analogue photography; major works through this period included Iconoclast and The Journey of The Skin Man. These were later used to illustrate the current concerns about photography at a symposium at The National Museum of Photography, Film and Television in 1991. The print and publishing industry viewed digital as either a threat to or an opportunity for the creative industries. Jackson fully embraced the changing tides and spent the next 20 years exploring ideas in the new technologies, producing multimedia installations in both physical and cyber spaces. Jackson has won many international awards for his work in recent years. He is the first photographer to receive three RPS International Print Awards. His work has been shown in the UK and worldwide including The National Portrait Gallery; The Photographers Gallery, London; The Brno Museum, Prague and the Museum Of Contemporary Arts in Argentina. His work is in many private and public collections.|$|E

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{identify}} the core constraints in financing of SMEs in Karachi that impede their growth and even undermine their liquidity and financial position. Literature review: The problems and constraints are faced by small and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in Karachi with regard to access to financing. Along with Karachi, the other cities and areas in Pakistan are facing alike problems. Methods: This study is exploratory in nature and includes quantitative and qualitative data. Data was collected through well designed questionnaire from a sample group of 500 respondents of SMEs in Karachi. In addition, one-on-one formal and informal interviews were also taken from various businessmen and bankers. Conceptual Model: A conceptual model / framework were devised to test and ascertain the statistical validity of the study. It includes dependent variable SME financing, and independent variables, financing constraints, functional/ internal barriers, government support and incentives, and SMEs growth and development. Findings: The findings revealed that most people / SMEs feel reluctant to borrow from banks and financial institutes because of stringent collateral requirements, high mark up, lengthy and convoluted <b>documentary</b> <b>process,</b> and to some extent malpractices at banks and financial institutions.
