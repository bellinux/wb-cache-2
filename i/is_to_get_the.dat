5|$|The {{object of}} the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> highest score. There are two play modes: Zen and Core. There is a 90-second time limit in Zen mode. In Core mode, players play until the screen fills with poorly placed tetrominos, similar to Tetris. Core has two difficulties. On the easiest difficulty, three-letter words suffice, but harder modes require five-letter words at a minimum. A score {{multiplier}} grows as players maintain a combo of multiple words created in succession, and resets if players are too slow. Scores are uploaded to Game Center.|$|E

25|$|During the Qing dynasty, {{criminal}} justice {{was based on}} extremely detailed Great Qing Legal Code. One element of the traditional Chinese {{criminal justice}} system {{is the notion that}} criminal law has a moral purpose, one of which <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> convicted to repent and see the error of his ways. In the traditional Chinese legal system, a person could not be convicted of a crime unless he has confessed. This often led to the use of torture, in order to extract the necessary confession. These elements still influence modern Chinese views toward law. All capital offenses were reported to the capital and required the personal approval of the emperor.|$|E
25|$|The {{journalist}} and BBC Radio 4 presenter John Humphrys has long stated that his career ambition <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> first full {{interview with the}} Queen. In 2006, the Queen came close to an orthodox interview when she agreed to be portrait-painted by the later-disgraced Australian artist and personality Rolf Harris, who engaged in small talk with her, on film, and with palace permission. It was shown on the BBC, CBC, and ABC. Their conversation ventured little beyond previous portraits of the Queen and royal art history in general, and the Queen's responses to Harris's conversational overtures were notably crisp and monosyllabic. The 1992 BBC documentary on the Queen, , directed by Edward Mirzoeff on the fortieth anniversary of her accession, attracted record audiences for a factual programme.|$|E
25|$|The Polali Chendu festival, {{also known}} as the {{football}} festival, is a widely popular football game which is conducted for a period of five days during the annual temple festival, seven days before avabritha. The football, which is a leather ball, is made by a cobbler family in Mijar. An oil miller family from Kadapu Karia is given the responsibility of bringing the ball from the cobbler family, wherein they announce the date of the commencement of the game after they place the ball in the freshly cleaned frontyard of Malali Ballal. On the evening of {{the first day of the}} family, the cobbler family place the ball and a palm leaf umbrella on the gopuram of the temple. After offering prayers to the deity, the ball is taken to the football field and the game is commenced. Up to five hundred people compete in the games, though any number of people may compete. The objective of the game <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> ball to the opposition's side. The game historically represents the fight of good over evil and the car festival at the end of the games are said to represent the victory of the good over the evil.|$|E

25|$|Brake discs and pads require {{sometime}} {{to adhere}} to each other smoothly. The pads need to deposit an even transfer layer. For street and urban driving with new pads and rotors {{it is best to}} treat them as a break in period as you would a new car for 200 to 300 miles after this period the manufactures bedding procedure can be followed. This is typically some number of stops from a certain max speed to a minimum speed. For example 10 moderate stops from 60 mph to 10mph in a safe controlled environment where no hazards are present. The goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> brake pads and brake discs hot. During this time it is ideal to keep the brake pressure and stops consistent without engaging the Anti lock braking system or skidding the tires. There will likely be smells and a light amount of smoke. This is normal. Once the brakes begin to suffer from fade(braking effectiveness slightly reduced) the process is complete. Continue to drive at moderate speeds to cool the brake discs and rotors avoiding the use of the brakes unless needed for emergency situations. Also take note when coming to a complete stop until everything has cooled not to hold your foot on the brakes which could create an imprint.|$|E
25|$|Goal-setting {{theory is}} based on the notion that {{individuals}} sometimes have a drive to reach a clearly defined end state. Often, this end state is a reward in itself. A goal's efficiency is affected by three features: proximity, difficulty and specificity. One common goal setting methodology incorporates the SMART criteria, in which goals are: specific, measurable, attainable/achievable, relevant, and time-bound. An ideal goal should present a situation where the time between the initiation of behavior and the end state is close. This explains why some children are more motivated to learn how to ride a bike than to master algebra. A goal should be moderate, not too hard or too easy to complete. In both cases, most people are not optimally motivated, as many want a challenge (which assumes some kind of insecurity of success). At the same time people want to feel that there is a substantial probability that they will succeed. Specificity concerns the description of the goal in their class. The goal should be objectively defined and intelligible for the individual. A classic example of a poorly specified goal <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> highest possible grade. Most children have no idea how much effort they need to reach that goal.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of season 9, Mitchell's main motivation <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> SG-1 team back together. Producer Robert C. Cooper wanted Cameron Mitchell to mirror the Stargate fandom and be a [...] "super fan" [...] of SG-1 and a [...] "Stargate geek", who is enthusiastic about exploring the galaxy. Nevertheless, Browder described Mitchell as a [...] "stoic" [...] character who [...] "actually follows military protocol"; the character has [...] "a certain naïvety and innocence, {{even though he is}} neither particularly naïve or innocent". Mitchell's personality and attitude depends on his location (on-base and off-world) and the people around him. With Mitchell's team demeanor becoming subtler in season 10, Browder felt that the writers [...] "finally figured out Mitchell's only superpower is getting beat up and bleeding".|$|E

500|$|In 1993 the San Diego Zoo {{experimentally}} {{tested the}} utility of a [...] "head-starting" [...] program for newly hatched Cuban iguanas with funding from the National Science Foundation's Conservation and Restoration Biology Program. [...] "Head-starting" [...] is a {{process by which the}} Cuban iguana's eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed for the first 20 months of their lives. The purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators. This technique was originally used to protect hatchling sea turtles, Galapagos land iguanas, and Ctenosaura bakeri on the island of Útila, but Alberts used {{it for the first time}} on a Cyclura species with the Cuban iguana. The purpose was not only to help the Cuban iguana population, but to test the overall effectiveness of headstarting as a conservation strategy for more critically endangered species of Cyclura.|$|E
500|$|The Iguana Research and Breeding station {{employs a}} [...] "head-starting" [...] program for newly hatched iguanas. [...] "Head-starting", {{originally}} {{used to protect}} hatching sea turtles, is a process by which iguana eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed until they are {{large enough to be}} protected from predation upon them. In the case of the Utila iguana, 50% of the animals hatched at the Center are maintained for the head-start program and the rest are released into mangrove forests after hatching. The purpose <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>the</b> animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators. The program has proven successful, as the iguanas behave like their wild-born counterparts. The success of the Utila program serves as a blueprint for other such programs in the Caribbean, particularly with Cyclura species such as the Cuban Iguana and Blue Iguana. They employ volunteers and their best volunteer was Ronan McGrath.|$|E

In an interview after Ocean's open letter, Malay called him [...] "the new hybrid of what an MC {{used to be in}} the '80s or '90s ... the true storyteller" [...] and said of the lyrics, [...] "I don't think anyone during any given point during the creative process knew what was happening ... when he's singing maybe from a female perspective or whatever, it's a story, it's a world that he created. It's not necessarily his personal—like something that he's experiencing. Maybe it is and it's a metaphor the way he did it". They finished writing Channel Orange in two to three months. Ocean said of the album's development in an interview for Rap-Up, [...] "It succinctly defines me as an artist for where I am right now and that was the aim. It's about the stories.

[...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution.

It was Universal just taking their assets and starting to play them off against each other...Milking it." [...] After viewing Alien vs. Predator, however, Cameron remarked that [...] "it was actually pretty good. I think of the five Alien films, I'd rate it third. I actually liked it. I actually liked it a lot." [...] Conversely, Ridley Scott had no interest in the Alien vs. Predator films. When asked in May 2012 if he had watched them, Scott laughed, [...] "No. I couldn't do that. I couldn't quite take that step." [...] Director Neill Blomkamp would eventually go on to pitch his sequel to Aliens.|$|E
