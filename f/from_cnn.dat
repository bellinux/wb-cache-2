25|$|On {{the date}} of the network switch, KDFW also debuted a daily local sports news program within its 9:00p.m. newscast, Sports 4 Texas, which also served as a {{generalized}} branding for its sports segments until January 1997; the program – which ran for 20 minutes on Monday through Friday nights (as well as Saturdays, {{with the exception of the}} NFL season, when the prime time newscast was abbreviated by a half-hour to air the Cowboys magazine show The Aikman-Summerall Report), and for a half-hour on Sundays – eventually evolved into its present weekly half-hour format as Fox 4 Sports Sunday in September 1997, when KDFW discontinued the weekend editions of its 10:00p.m. newscast, relegating that newscast to Monday through Friday evenings (Fox late night programming airs on Saturdays at 10:00p.m., while Sports Sunday airs Sundays in that time slot). In advance of the switch, KDFW station management offered news department employees a one-month pay bonus as an incentive to agree to stay until or after the affiliation switch. Because Fox did not have a news division – and by association, an affiliate news service – at the time KDFW joined the network (Fox News Channel and the Fox News Edge video service would not launch until August 1996), the station's news department initially relied on external video feeds <b>from</b> <b>CNN</b> Newsource for coverage of national and international news stories; the station also increased its news staff from 80 to 120 employees, through the hiring of 40 additional employees in both on-air and behind-the-scenes roles.|$|E

40|$|A {{new musical}} {{instrument}} classification method using convolutional neural networks (CNNs) {{is presented in}} this paper. Unlike the traditional methods, we investigated a scheme for classifying musical instruments using the learned features <b>from</b> <b>CNNs.</b> To create the learned features <b>from</b> <b>CNNs,</b> we not only used a conventional spectrogram image, but also proposed multiresolution recurrence plots (MRPs) that contain the phase information of a raw input signal. Consequently, we fed the characteristic timbre of the particular instrument into a neural network, which cannot be extracted using a phase-blinded representations such as a spectrogram. By combining our proposed MRPs and spectrogram images with a multi-column network, the performance of our proposed classifier system improves over a system that uses only a spectrogram. Furthermore, the proposed classifier also outperforms the baseline result from traditional handcrafted features and classifiers. Comment: 14 pages, 5 figures, 1 tabl...|$|R
