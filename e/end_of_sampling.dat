40|$|Community {{development}} of ascidians was monitored weekly in Mission Bay (San Diego, California, USA) from September 2011 through November 2012 {{to assess how}} ascidian communities might be structured by spatial differences in environmental conditions. We repeatedly photographed PVC plates that were deployed on floating docks at four sampling locations: Seaforth Landing, Mission Bay Yacht Club, South Shores, and Hilton. Environmental variables (temperature, salinity, visibility, flow and dissolved oxygen) were measured during each sampling period. Eleven of the fifteen ascidian species observed on plates were invasive, three were native, and one was cryptogenic. Ascidian community composition varied significantly by time and sampling location within Mission Bay. Spatial differences in community dissimilarity were correlated to visibility, salinity, and temperature. Ascidian communities established in the warm, hypersaline waters furthest {{from the mouth of}} Mission Bay were typically most different from those near the mouth. Comparisons of % dissimilarity at the beginning and <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> indicated that ascidian communities were more dissimilar at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> Ascidians persisted year round, and invasive and cryptogenic species were generally more abundant in winter months than native species. Below average rainfall, and the consequent relatively warm sea surface temperature and high salinity in a relatively mild climate region like San Diego, probably prevented the winter ascidian die-offs that typically occur in this area. Such environmental changes may be advantageous to invasive ascidians, not only with regard to mediating their persistence, but also in terms of facilitating the establishment, spread, and dominance o...|$|E

Our aim was to elucidate the value of direct ethanol metabolites as measures of abstinence. Ethyl glucuronide (EtG) and fatty acid ethyl esters (FAEE) in hair, phosphatidylethanol in whole blood and EtG and ethyl sulphate in urine were measured. The results were compared with self-report of alcohol consumption and traditional blood biomarkers for chronically elevated alcohol consumption as carbohydrate deficient transferrin (CDT), gamma glutamyl transpeptidase, mean corpuscular erythrocyte volume, aspartate aminotransferase and alanine aminotransferase. EtG was found in distal parts of hair only, whereas the proximal parts were negative. Furthermore, FAEE concentrations were found in the typical distribution over the hair length and showed values typical for either moderate social drinking or abstinence. CDT was above cut-off in 9 out of 16 analyses with a decreasing tendency and the lowest values in the last 2 months before the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> The data suggest that in addition to traditional markers, a combination of direct ethanol metabolites can be useful in the expert assessment of judging driving ability.

Serum antibody titers were measured on day 18, 21 and 25 by Haemaglutination Inhibition Test and expressed as Geometric Mean Titer (log 2). Antibody titer to NDV vaccine was already detectable two weeks after vaccination (on day 18). The titer value was highest in D 1 + reaching 6. 0 which was above protective level and the lowest value was found in D 1 i. e. 2. 75 (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The Antarctic {{silverfish}} Pleuragramma antarcticum {{is a key}} organism in {{the ecology}} of Southern Ocean. Eggs with fully developed yolk-sac embryos and newly hatched larvae have been recently observed {{to occur in the}} platelet ice accumulating below the sea-ice layer. This environment has strong pro-oxidant characteristics at the beginning of austral spring, when the rapid growth of algal ice communities, the massive release of nutrients and the photoactivation of dissolved organic carbon and nitrates, all represent important sources for oxyradical formation. Such processes are concentrated {{in a short period of}} a few weeks which overlaps with the final development of P. antarcticum in platelet ice. The aim of this work was to characterize the antioxidant system in embryos of P. antarcticum and the responsiveness toward the natural increase of pro-oxidant conditions in early spring. Considering the lack of ecotoxicological data on this species and its pivotal importance in the ecosystem of Southern Ocean, the sensitivity of its early life stages was also evaluated after laboratory exposures to environmentally relevant doses of benzo(a) pyrene, as a model chemical potentially released from anthropogenic activities. Obtained results revealed a marked temporal increase of antioxidants in embryos of P. antarcticum as adaptive counteracting responses to oxidative conditions of platelet ice. Particularly prompt responses were observed for glutathione metabolism which, however, did not prevent formation of increasing levels of lipid peroxidation products; from the analysis of total oxyradical scavenging capacity (TOSC), the overall efficiency to neutralize peroxyl radicals remained almost constant while slightly lower TOSC values were obtained toward hydroxyl radicals at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> period. Laboratory exposures to 0. 5 - 5 mu g/ 1 BaP caused a significant accumulation of this PAH but no significant effects on the activity of cytochrome P 450. Antioxidants of exposed embryos showed less marked variations than embryos in field conditions suggesting that the elevated pro-oxidant challenge, to which these organisms are naturally adapted, might be responsible for the moderate responsiveness to pro-oxidant chemicals...|$|E

We conducted a trial of TDF and TDF-emtricitabine (FTC) in HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants. Women received a single dose of either 600 mg TDF, 900 mg TDF, or 900 mg TDF- 600 mg FTC at labor onset or prior to a cesarean section. Infants received no drug or a single dose of TDF at 4 mg/kg of body weight or of TDF at 4 mg/kg plus FTC at 3 mg/kg as soon as possible after birth. All regimens were safe and well tolerated. Maternal areas under the serum concentration-time curve (AUC) and concentrations at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> after 24 h (C 24) were similar between the two doses of TDF; the maximum concentrations of the drugs in serum (Cmax) and cord blood concentrations were higher in women delivering via cesarean section than in those who delivered vaginally (P = 0. 04 and 0. 046, respectively). The median ratio of the TFV concentration in cord blood to that in the maternal plasma at delivery was 0. 73 (range, 0. 26 to 1. 95). Without TDF administration, infants had a median TFV concentration of 12 ng/ml 12 h after birth. Following administration of a single dose of TDF at 4 mg/kg, infant TFV concentrations fell below the targeted level, 50 ng/ml, by 24 h postdose. In HIV-infected pregnant women and their infants, 600 mg of TDF is acceptable as a single dose during labor. Low concentrations at birth support infant dosing as soon after birth as possible. Rapidly decreasing TFV levels in infants suggest that multiple or higher doses of TDF will be necessary to maintain concentrations that are effective for viral suppression...|$|E

40|$|Postdepositional loss of nitrate in near-surface {{snowfall}} is well known, with mean {{levels of}} nitrate in ice cores of around 20 to 80 ng gâ 1, while nitrate in surface snow may occasionally reach over 300 ng gâ 1. This has been explained as reemission of nitrate (as nitric acid) during aging, via {{processes that are}} not yet clear. However, clear seasonal cycles remain in nitrate profiles from higher accumulation rate ice cores and, across Antarctica, the mean concentration of nitrate is remarkably similar despite widely varying deposition conditions, marking nitrate out as quite different to other major ice core species. This paper examines the year-round deposition of nitrate at the snow surface at a coastal Antarctic site and discusses the degree and timing of nitrate loss. At Halley Station, Antarctica, the mean concentration of near-surface snow was 96 ng gâ 1 over a 2. 6 year daily sampling period, while the mean concentration in newly accumulated snow was 79 ng gâ 1. At {{the end of this}} period, a shallow core integrating the sampling period had a mean nitrate concentration of 65 ng gâ 1 taken over 2 full years of accumulation. Nitrate concentrations in the surface layer were in general highest during the summer period reaching 400 ng gâ 1 with a mean of about 150 ng gâ 1 in each of December, January, and February, and lowest during the winter with a mean of around 50 ng gâ 1 in June. Fresh snow data from Neumayer Station shows a similar seasonal signal, with a mean nitrate concentration of 77 ng gâ 1, while year-round aerosol data shows total nitrate (particulate and gas phase) in the air is at a minimum in April to June and reaches a maximum in late November [Wagenbach et al., this issue], slightly out of phase with snowfall nitrate. The observation of a reduction in high nitrate concentrations in new snowfall over a few days {{does not appear to be}} general, and at Halley, there is evidence of both uptake and loss of nitrate in the surface snow layer, possibly indicating an equilibrium with changing air concentrations. However, there is attenuation of the nitrate signal over the longer period, with concentrations in the ice core taken at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling</b> never reaching values seen in the upper surface layer...|$|E
40|$|Lead- 210 (half-life 22. 3 y), is {{a natural}} radionuclide, being {{produced}} in the atmosphere through radon decay. Due to its affinity for particles, it is rapidly fixed by aerosols and, with its long half-life {{is the most important}} tracer of long range atmospheric aerosol transport and removal processes. Main measurement techniques adopted to evaluate 210 Pb air activity concentration differ in analysis and sample preparation methods. Some of them involved complex chemical processes or decay product detection (for example 210 Po), with a long decay time period between sampling and experimental measurement. The availability of an high-volume particulate sampler (about 900 m 3 h- 1) combined with a low background gamma-ray spectrometric system based on an Ortec HPGe, type GLP Series Planar Low-Energy Photon Spectrometer (LEPS) allows the evaluation of 210 Pb airborne activity concentration by gamma-ray spectrometry of particulate samplings after a short time period {{from the end of the}} sampling. In this work, a measurement procedure able to distinguish the airborne 210 Pb from the one product on filter by decay of 222 Rn products is proposed. Indeed, during the sampling, the number of 210 Pb nuclei on filter increases for both filtration of those present in air and for decay of radon products fixed on the filter. The method consists on the contemporary evaluation of an equivalent radon concentration by a series of gamma ray spectrometric measurements after a minimum decay time period from the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>sampling.</b> A comparison with a model allows the evaluation of 210 Pb activity percentage produced by decay of short-lived radon daughters on the filter matrix during and after the sampling. A gamma-ray spectrometric measurement, with reference to 46. 5 keV gamma emission of 210 Pb, after a few days from the sampling allows the determination of total 210 Pb. The airborne 210 Pb activity and derived air concentration was at last computed by a simple differentiation of the two contributions. Experimental tests have allowed obtaining a range of 2 Ã· 10 per cent for 210 Pb activity percentage on a filter due to decay of short-lived radon daughters, with higher values when 210 Pb air activity concentration is very low. All the measurements resulted above detection limit, even in the case of a short sampling time period...|$|E
