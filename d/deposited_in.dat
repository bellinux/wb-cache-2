5|$|Californium {{can enter}} the body from ingesting {{contaminated}} food or drinks or by breathing air with suspended particles of the element. Once in the body, only 0.05% of the californium will reach the bloodstream. About 65% of that californium will be <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the skeleton, 25% in the liver, and the rest in other organs, or excreted, mainly in urine. Half of the californium <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the skeleton and liver are gone in 50 and 20 years, respectively. Californium in the skeleton adheres to bone surfaces before slowly migrating throughout the bone.|$|E
5|$|No {{consensus}} {{has been}} reached on the exact depositional nature of the Irati oil shale. One theory suggests that the organic material in the Irati oil shale originated from algae <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> a lacustrine environment with salinity varying from that of freshwater to brackish water. Other theory suggests that the organic sediment may have been <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> a shallow, partially restricted marine environment. Hutton's classification describes it as a marine source oil shale.|$|E

5|$|The holotype of Herrerasaurus (PVL 2566) was {{discovered}} in the Cancha de Bochas Member of the Ischigualasto Formation in San Juan, Argentina. It was collected in 1961 by Victorino Herrera, in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the Carnian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 235 to 221 million years ago. Over the years, the Ischigualasto Formation produced other fossils ultimately referred to Herrerasaurus. In 1958, A.S. Romer discovered specimen MCZ 7063, originally referred to Staurikosaurus in Carnian sediments. Herrerasaurus specimens PVL 2045 and MLP(4)61, were collected in 1959 and 1960, respectively, in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the Norian stage of the Triassic period, approximately 228 to 208 million years ago. In 1960, Scaglia collected specimen MACN 18.060, originally the holotype of Ischisaurus cattoi, in sediments <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the Carnian stage. In 1961, Scaglia collected Herrerasaurus specimen PVL 2558, in the Carnian beds of this formation. In 1990, the Cancha de Bochas Member produced more Herrerasaurus specimens, also from its Carnian beds. Specimen PVSJ 53, originally the holotype of Frenguellisaurus, was collected by Gargiulo & OÃ±ate in 1975 in sediments that were <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the Carnian stage.|$|E
5|$|The {{next two}} periods of {{geologic}} history, the Ordovician and the Silurian, are {{missing from the}} Grand Canyon sequence.

Either way, this break in the geologic history of the area spans about 65million years. A type of unconformity called a disconformity was formed. Disconformities show erosional features such as valleys, hills and cliffs that are later covered by younger sediments.|$|E

5|$|Geologists have {{classified}} the volcano's {{lava flows}} into two units. The Hawi Volcanic layers were <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the shield {{stage of the}} volcano's life, and the younger Pololu Volcanics were <b>deposited</b> <b>in</b> the volcano's post-shield stage. The rock in the younger Hawi section, which overlies the older Pololu flows, is mostly 260,000 to 140,000 years old, and composed mainly of hawaiite and trachyte. The separation between the two layers is not clear; the lowest layers may actually be in the Pololu section, based on their depositional patterns and low phosphorus content. The time intervals separating the two periods of volcanic evolution were extremely brief, something first noted in 1988.|$|E
