5000|$|Deep brain {{stimulation}} to the {{basal ganglia}} and thalamus {{has recently been}} used as a successful treatment for tremors of patients with Parkinson's disease. This technique is currently being implanted in patients with spasmodic torticollis in clinical trials. These patients are subjected to stimulation of the globus pallidus internus, or the subthalamic nucleus. The device is analogous to a pacemaker, an external battery is placed subcutaneously with wires through the skin and enter the skull to a region of the brain. To stimulate the globus pallidus internus, microelectrodes are placed into the globus pallidus internus bilaterally. After the surgery is performed, multiple trips are required to program the settings for the stimulator. The stimulation of the globus pallidus internus disrupts the abnormal <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> in the globus pallidus internus, resulting in inhibition of hyperactive cortical activity. Globus pallidus internus deep brain stimulation is the preferred surgical procedure due to the lower frequency of side effects. [...] Advantages of deep brain stimulations include the reversibility of the procedure, and the ability to adjust settings of stimulation.|$|E

Under the stimulation of the neuron’s membrane potential whose <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> is period or the chaos, the two uncoupled neurons under different initial conditions, whose parameter r (the parameter r {{is related to the}} membrane penetration of calcium ion, and reflects the changing speed of the slow adaptation current) is different or the same, can realize the full synchronization (state synchronization) or discharge synchronization (phase synchronization), and can only be synchronized to the <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> of the stimulation neuron. The synchronization characteristics are mainly related to the <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> and the strength of the stimulation neuron’s membrane potential, and are little related to the parameter r and the initial state of the two uncoupled neurons. This investigation shows the characteristics of the neuron’s membrane potential affecting the synchronization process of neurons, and the neurons’ discharge patterns and synchronization process can be adjusted and controlled by the <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> and the strength of the stimulation neuron’s membrane potential.

40|$|OBJECT: Neurodevelopmental lesions (NDLs) such as glioneuronal tumors and {{cortical}} dysplasia produce characteristic electrocorticography (ECoG) <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns.</b> Because cavernomas, another congenital abnormality, {{are also}} associated with pharmacoresistant epilepsy, the authors wondered whether they exhibit <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns</b> similar to those occurring in NDLs. METHODS: Intraoperative ECoG recordings from 19 patients with cavernomas and 54 with NDLs were reviewed for continuous spikes, bursts, or recruiting discharges and to determine whether these patterns were spatially coincident with the lesion. Relative densities of microglia {{and the intensity of}} Fe 3 + staining in surgical samples were evaluated. Seizure outcome was assessed 1 year after surgery. RESULTS: The mean ages at seizure onset and surgery were higher in patients in the cavernoma group than in the NDL group (22. 5 and 36. 4 years compared with 10. 0 and 25. 2 years, respectively). Neocortical <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns</b> occurred equally in patients with either cavernomas (53 %) or NDLs (41 %). In the mesiotemporal area coincident bursts occurred more often in patients with cavernomas than patients with NDLs (55 % compared with 10 %, respectively). Coincident continuous spiking was associated with a longer duration of epilepsy in patients with cavernomas (23. 5 years compared with 11. 4 years for those without coincident continuous spiking) and with a lower age at seizure onset in those with NDLs (4. 1 years compared with 11. 8 years for those without coincident continuous spiking). In the cavernoma group the absence of coincident bursts was associated with high microglia density. There were no associations between the intensity of Fe 3 + staining and <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns,</b> although the <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns</b> were associated with a worse outcome in patients with NDLs. CONCLUSIONS: In patients with NDLs, continuous spiking patterns may be markers of a widespread epileptogenic zone due to an early insult to the developing brain; in patients with cavernomas, such patterns may indicate secondary epileptogenesis.

40|$|The {{purpose was}} to {{identify}} and characterize the <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns</b> of pontile neurons which {{are responsible for the}} termination of inspiratory activity. Phrenic discharge is prolonged following destruction of neurons at the junction of mesencephalon and pons by neurotoxins. Neuronal activities were recorded in this region in decerebrate, vagotomized, paralyzed and ventilated cats. At normocapnia, neurons had tonic <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns,</b> most of which were linked to phasic periods of phrenic activity. Peak activities occurred in late neural inspiration or early expiration. In hypercapnia, neuronal discharge frequencies did not increase, rather activity became more concentrated during one portion of the respiratory cycle. In severe hypoxia, neuronal activities diminished in parallel with the prolongations of phrenic discharge and establishment of apneusis. During recovery, some neurons transiently acquired phasic, respiratory-modulated <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns.</b> Neuronal activities from neighboring regions did not exhibit comparable changes in hypercapnia or hypoxia. We conclude that rostral pontile neuronal activities are a primary determinant of the reversible and irreversible terminations of eupneic inspiratory activity. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

From the coefficient of variation (CV), the spontaneous activities of OVAR-responsive neurons were classified into regular and irregular patterns. Of the neurons (n = 36) that showed symmetric and stable bidirectional response sensitivity (δ defined as CW gain over CCW gain) to OVAR (10 ° tilt), some exhibited progressive phase shift with velocity (1. 75 - 15 °/s) while others exhibited stable response phase.

The stomach was distended with the air-charged balloon. From such fibre preparations, impulses during maintained gastric distension were recorded. In some fibres, burst and pause of discharge recurred periodically. Such type of <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> was described here as periodically intermittent discharge, in which the relation between gastric distension and impulse activity was pursued. Therein, gastric distension was represented by gastric content in terms of volume and impulse activity by the total number of impulses during stomach discharge period (sum of the duration of burst and pause of discharge) from following two reasons. Firstly, analysis of <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> showed that, when the degree of stomach distension became higher, the duration of burst of discharge became longer, that of pause shorter, while stomach discharge period showed only slight change. Secondly, experiments suggested that, in the fibres in which the response to maintained distension of the stomach was expected to be a slowly adapting discharge, the above-mentioned type of <b>discharge</b> <b>pattern</b> came into existence under the influence of peristaltic movement in and around the site of the receptor. Thus, the relation between the increase of gastric content and that of total number of impulses during stomach discharge period was found nearly proportional and two sorts of values, 22. 5 impulses/ 50 cc and 161 impulses/ 50 cc, were regarded as proportional constant...|$|E

Recent work {{has focused on the}} contribution of conductances mediating persistent inward currents (PICs), which amplify and prolong the effects of synaptic inputs on motoneuron discharge. Certain features of human motor unit discharge are thought to reflect a relatively stereotyped activation of PICs by excitatory synaptic inputs; these features include rate saturation and de-recruitment at a lower level of net excitation than that required for recruitment. However, PIC activation is also influenced by the pattern and spatial distribution of inhibitory inputs that are activated concurrently with excitatory inputs. To estimate the potential contributions of PIC activation and synaptic input patterns to motor unit <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns,</b> we examined the responses of a set of cable motoneuron models to different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The models were first tuned to approximate the current- and voltage-clamp responses of low- and medium-threshold spinal motoneurons studied in decerebrate cats and then driven with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory inputs. The responses of the models to excitatory inputs reproduced a number of features of human motor unit <b>discharge.</b> However, the <b>pattern</b> of rate modulation was strongly influenced by the temporal and spatial pattern of concurrent inhibitory inputs. Thus, even though PIC activation is likely to exert a strong influence on firing rate modulation, PIC activation in combination with different patterns of excitatory and inhibitory synaptic inputs can produce a wide variety of motor unit <b>discharge</b> <b>patterns...</b>|$|R
