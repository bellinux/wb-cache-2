5|$|Potter, however, did {{not feel}} he fitted into this {{increasingly}} experimental sound the band was developing and tended {{to wait until the}} others had worked out their parts during rehearsals, adding his bass lines on top at the last minute. After recording three tracks of their third album, H to He, Who Am the Only One (December 1970), he decided to quit the band. His last gig was on 9 August at the 1970 Plumpton Festival. The remaining members auditioned Dave Anderson, roadie for Brinsley Schwarz and friend of the band, but after a week's rehearsal found that things weren't working out musically. Banton, meanwhile, had become influenced by Vincent Crane's work in Atomic Rooster, where Crane played the bass lines on a Hammond organ's bass pedals and suggested that he could do this as well. With just <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the next gig, they tried rehearsing as a four-piece, and it was successful. Banton later played bass guitar on certain songs, having already learned the instrument in the mid-1960s, and Hammill expanded his instrumental capabilities on stage to cover piano and keyboards as well as guitar. Jackson modified his saxophones to be completely electric, as opposed to simply being amplified through a microphone, and combined the sound with a wah-wah pedal and an octave divider.|$|E
500|$|Chotiner {{had worked}} on Warren's 1942 campaign, but had parted ways from him, and the popular {{governor}} {{did not want to}} be connected to the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to maneuver him into an endorsement. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to know who she was supporting for governor, as other Young Republicans handed out copies of the Pink Sheet. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the election and the Democratic candidate near exhaustion from the bitter campaign, she responded that she hoped and prayed that Roosevelt would be elected. Holt contacted a delighted Chotiner, who had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's comments, and the governor responded, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, and the campaign assured voters that Nixon would be voting for Warren as well.|$|E
500|$|Abrams {{spent much}} of the {{remainder}} of the campaign trying to get Ferraro's endorsement. Ferraro, enraged and bitter after the nature of the primary, ignored Abrams and accepted Bill Clinton's request to campaign for his presidential bid instead. She was eventually persuaded by Governor Mario Cuomo and state party leaders into giving an unenthusiastic endorsement with just three <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the general election, in exchange for an apology by Abrams for the tone of the primary. D'Amato won the election by a very narrow margin. Overall the 1992 U.S. Senate elections saw five victories that it became known as the [...] "Year of the Woman". The Ferraro-Holtzman fighting of the campaign was viewed as a disaster by many feminists, however, with Ferraro denied her political comeback while Holtzman also politically damaged herself. The feud between Ferraro and Holtzman from the 1992 Senate primary lingered, as the following year Ferraro supported Assemblyman Alan Hevesi's successful primary challenge that unseated Holtzman as New York City comptroller; Ferraro denied that her endorsement was motivated by revenge against Holtzman, saying it was due to his liberal State Assembly voting record.|$|E

500|$|Chotiner had parted {{ways with}} Governor Warren, {{and the popular}} governor, who was running for a third term, [...] "wanted no part" [...] of the Nixon campaign. Nonetheless, Chotiner sought to {{maneuver}} the future chief justice into an endorsement of Representative Nixon. Chotiner instructed Young Republicans head and future congressman Joseph F. Holt to follow Douglas from appearance to appearance and demand to {{know who she was}} supporting for governor. Douglas repeatedly avoided the question, but with four <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the election and the Democratic candidate [...] "close to collapse" [...] from the bitter campaign, she responded to the latest Holt needle with her [...] "hope and pray" [...] that Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Roosevelt would be elected. A delighted Chotiner had a reporter ask Warren about Douglas's reply, and the governor commented, [...] "In view of her statement, I might ask her how she expects I will vote when I mark my ballot for United States senator on Tuesday." [...] Chotiner publicized this response as an endorsement of Nixon, which Warren did not deny. Both Warren and Nixon won overwhelming victories on Election Day.|$|E

2500|$|Argentina beat Uruguay 10 in {{the round}} of 16 wearing blue cotton shirts that coach Carlos Bilardo {{believed}} would prove too uncomfortable in the searing Mexico City heat. [...] Bilardo asked Argentina’s kit manufacturer {{to come up with}} lighter blue shirts for the quarterfinal, an impossible request given the short deadline. [...] With just three <b>days</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the match, he sent out Ruben Moschella, a member of his coaching staff, to scour the shops of the Mexican capital for a suitable kit. He returned with two different blue shirts, which they subsequently weighed but were unable to choose between. It was then that Diego Maradona appeared and said: “That’s a nice jersey. We’ll beat England in that.” [...] Moschella returned to the shop and bought 38 of the shirts for the side to wear in the showdown versus England. A designer fashioned some makeshift Argentine Football Association (AFA) badges, which were then sewn on to each jersey, with silvery American Football shirt numbers hurriedly ironed on to the backs.|$|E

50|$|It {{was agreed}} that Scott would be {{designated}} handling pilot {{for the race}} and occupy {{the front seat of}} the tandem cockpit, piloting the take-off and landing at every enforced checkpoint along the route and any other refuelling, or necessary stops for the entirety of the race. The flying of the plane would be on a fifty-fifty basis involving shifts of 4 hours on four hours off. Just six days before the start of the race Scott flew the newly built scarlet Comet, number 34 named Grosvenor House G-ACSS, which had only logged 83 minutes of flight time, from Hatfield Aerodrome where it had been built to RAF Mildenhall and made a nicely judged landing. He later admitted that he had never handled a twin engine aircraft before this one. With one <b>day</b> <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the start of the race, amidst frantic last-minute preparations a Royal visit was made by HRH The Prince of Wales whom Scott was photographed with explaining the new variable-pitch propeller system fitted to his Comet. Their Royal Highnesses King George V and Queen Mary also visited that afternoon at very short notice, meeting competitors including Scott.|$|R

But as Joleen feels elated over her sudden discovery, she left out one minor detail: Joleen didn’t actually sing in the YouTube video, she was lip-synching to another artist's song, which was a demo made by a friend of Joleen's (the vocals was done by Tracy Tan, who plays Huay on the show). With one <b>day</b> left <b>to</b> <b>go</b> <b>before</b> the recording in which she has to actually sing for real, the quintet try to turn Joleen into a real singer by concocting a strange and elaborate plan that involves Andy singing falsetto.|$|R
