5|$|A {{number of}} signings {{were made by}} Arsenal in the summer {{transfer}} window, namely defenders Sylvinho and Oleh Luzhny, and striker Thierry Henry, who joined from Juventus on a club record fee. Davor Šuker departed Real Madrid to sign for Arsenal, following Nicolas Anelka's move <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction. Steve Bould left Arsenal to play for Sunderland, while Stephen Hughes signed for Everton in the spring.|$|E
5|$|A signal {{travelling}} {{along an}} electrical transmission line will be partly, or wholly, reflected back <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction when the travelling signal encounters a discontinuity in the characteristic impedance of the line, {{or if the}} far end of the line is not terminated in its characteristic impedance. This can happen, for instance, if two lengths of dissimilar transmission lines are joined together.|$|E
5|$|Another area of {{interest}} for Rubin was the phenomenon of counter-rotation in galaxies. Her discovery that some gas and stars moved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction to {{the rotation of the}} rest of the galaxy challenged the prevailing theory that all of the material in a galaxy moved in the same direction, and provided the first evidence for galaxy mergers and the process by which galaxies initially formed.|$|E

5|$|Assuming {{that the}} {{equivalence}} principle holds, gravity influences {{the passage of}} time. Light sent down into a gravity well is blueshifted, whereas light sent <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction (i.e., climbing out of the gravity well) is redshifted; collectively, these two effects are known as the gravitational frequency shift. More generally, processes close to a massive body run more slowly when compared with processes taking place farther away; this effect is known as gravitational time dilation.|$|E
5|$|Austria and {{the states}} of the Habsburg monarchy officially had a {{different}} standard since 1761, and Prussia, followed by its neighbours Anhalt, Lippe and Mecklenburg, would diverge <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction with a reform in 1816. But in both cases apothecaries continued to use the Nuremberg standard unofficially {{for a long time after}} it became illegal.|$|E

There is only one bus on a Sunday. The same Number1 service runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction too, from Grantham to Lincoln via Navenby, every 30minutes each day except Sunday. Hodson's Coaches of Navenby runs an extra bus each Sunday to Lincoln.|$|E

5|$|Kovalainen's car had {{apparently}} been fitted with mismatched tyres {{at the front of}} the car during the first stint, meaning that the tyres spun <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction to which they were designed, causing his understeer. At his first pit stop his team, not realising the cause of the problem, had adjusted his front wing to compensate for the understeer and replaced the tyres correctly. This caused further handling problems, and eventually led to his retirement.|$|E
5|$|Notts County's fate went <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction. They were relegated in bottom {{place the}} season after the 1996 {{play-off}} final defeat, only to win the 1997–98 Third Division title and gain instant promotion. However, they have spent every season since in the bottom two divisions. The two clubs did not meet again in league football until January 2008 after City's fall back down the league structure.|$|E

5|$|On 8 July 2009, Costa {{was sold}} to Real Valladolid {{as part of the}} deal that sent goalkeeper Sergio Asenjo <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction, with the {{transfer}} including a €1million buy-back option that could be activated by Atlético at the end of the season. García Pitarch confessed that there was a verbal agreement that Costa would definitely return at the end of the campaign, and that the deal had been made to look permanent in order to give Costa more commitment to his new club.|$|E
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 3, the local weather station {{reported}} clear conditions due to a malfunction, while {{a thick layer of}} fog rolled onto the highway.

5|$|The {{equivalence}} between gravitational and {{inertial effects}} {{does not constitute}} a complete theory of gravity. When it comes to explaining gravity near our own location on the Earth's surface, noting that our reference frame is not in free fall, so that fictitious forces are to be expected, provides a suitable explanation. But a freely falling reference frame {{on one side of}} the Earth cannot explain why the people on the opposite side of the Earth experience a gravitational pull <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>opposite</b> direction.|$|E
5|$|The {{flags and}} pennants point to the low pressure, so it is {{possible}} to determine at which hemisphere the station is standing.
