There is this amazing German house-techno music, so I wanted to make a pop {{experimental}} record. <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wanted to leave the '80s a little bit, so the chorus is a '90s melody, which is what the inspiration was. There was certainly some whisky involved in the writing of the record. It's about being in love with your best friend.|$|E

As a police officer, I have a male partner and the video goes through our days. My husband's at work and has attractive girls flirting with him but he declines their advances. I have a guy flirting with me, and I flirt back.|$|E

500|$|Producer Paul Rabwin was displeased {{with the}} final episode, noting, [...] "'Badlaa' was the one episode I {{did not like the}} most [...] I think if I had done it different, I would have had John Shiban change the method of transportation. I don't think it ever worked on any level for me. It was just weird and creepy, but I think the whole idea was distasteful to me."

500|$|Guillory {{explained}} that she [...] "became an actor because I {{wanted to know what}} it was like to be other people.

I started acting because I got offered a job when I was 16, and they wanted to pay me £8,000, and we'd always lived on Family Support". She went on to say that her frustration with later film roles left her bitter, but after seeing Helen Mirren onstage she was inspired again.|$|E

500|$|The role of Martha was {{originally}} played by Burcin Kapkin upon her introduction in 1988. In 2005 the character {{returned to the}} show, played by the model Jodi Gordon. Gordon took acting lessons before successfully auditioning for the role. Gordon later revealed that she was initially nervous about auditioning due to her lack of acting experience. However, producers gave her two months prior to filming so she could learn her scripts and gain more acting skills. Gordon said, [...] "I'd never done any acting. So I did a few little acting course things and then <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> fluked the part".|$|E
500|$|The teaser was {{presented}} to the network on May 2, 2007. Nellie Andreeva of The Hollywood Reporter wrote that Dawn Ostroff, president of The CW at the time, had responded positively to the new concept. The series's title might have been changed if the FBI idea had been accepted. The CW had recently cancelled Gilmore Girls, leading some news outlets to speculate that Veronica Mars might be renewed in order to fill a schedule hole. Several cast members, including Gonzalo and Lowell, had taken other acting opportunities in anticipation of the series's cancellation. Nevertheless, Thomas stated, [...] "I don't think we're dead; <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> like our chances." ...|$|E
500|$|Speaking of {{the album}} cover, Ranaldo said: [...] "in some ways the whole album started with the cover photo, and <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> built it up from there. A young Canadian {{photographer}} took that photo of me in September 2010 during an interview session about legendary Canadian group The Nihilist Spasm Band. When I saw the photo I thought it looked so much like a cool album cover. At that point I only had three or four acoustic demos going, and it remained {{in the back of}} my mind that if I ever made enough songs for an album, I’d use that pic as the cover. So that helped push me to develop the songs." ...|$|E

Albini later observed the use of studio banter on Surfer Rosa: [...] "It's on their record forever so I think now they are obliged to say that they're ok with it, but I honestly don't know that that idea would've ever come up if I hadn't done it. There are times when things like that are revealing and entertaining and <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> felt it was a bit gimmicky on this record." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{video was}} {{immediately}} banned in eleven countries {{due to its}} overtly sexual content.

I was full nude". An unrestricted version of the video was later uploaded to Rihanna's official website. Melina Matsoukas responded to the news in an interview with MTV News, stating: [...] "When I go out to make something, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> go out with the intention to get it banned– [...] not to get it banned... but to make something provocative... it's making an effect and people are having a dialogue about it, so, to me, that's successful." ...|$|E
500|$|Several of {{the songs}} on the album drew their lyrics from real life relationships. [...] "Peachy" [...] {{documents}} the permanent breakup of a relationship that had inspired her 2004 single [...] "Ten Days". [...] "Where I Stood", which Higgins calls [...] "a pretty sad love song", describes the end of another relationship. She said it portrays [...] "one of those situations where you just feel that leaving this person is {{something you have to}} do to get to know yourself again." [...] "Secret" [...] was about an ex-girlfriend who was uncomfortable about going public with their relationship; [...] "I was so head over heels in love with her <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> wanted to shout it out to the world, so it was just a song about keeping something under the covers ... keeping it away locked in a little room." ...|$|E

I am trusting my instinct and it is telling me now is the appropriate time to stop (playing). Had I already decided to retire before the (Heineken Cup semi-final) loss in Montpellier last month? <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> knew. My lads are gone. My boys in the team are gone." [...] Munster Rugby Chief Executive Garrett Fitzgerald also paid tribute to O'Gara: [...] "In wishing Ronan the very best in the future, I’d like to acknowledge the immense contribution he has made to Munster Rugby and indeed rugby in general in Ireland over the course of what has been a fabulous career." ...|$|E
500|$|Strapping Young Lad {{began working}} on their next album, Alien, in March 2004. Feeling that the band's {{previous}} album did {{not live up to}} expectations, Townsend decided to take his music to a new extreme.

[...] "I think that as an artist, in order for me to get to the next plateau, <b>I</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> feel the need to explore things and sometimes that exploration leads you to places that are a little crazy," [...] he explains. [...] "And Alien was no exception with that."
