40|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a simple {{implementation}} of an optimum <b>Geometric</b> <b>decoder</b> (GD) {{for use in}} MIMO systems. The decoder uses the channel matrix to construct a hyper paraboloid and then restricts the symbol vectors to be searched to a hyper ellipsoid projected from the hyper paraboloid. Computer simulation results on 4 × 4 different MIMO systems transmitting 16 QAM and 64 QAM show that the proposed GD can achieve the same bit-error-rate (BER) performances {{as those of the}} Maximum Likelihood (ML) decoder, yet having much less complexity. published_or_final_versionThe 5 th IEEE GCC Conference & Exhibition, Kuwait City, Kuwait, 17 - 19 March 2009.

40|$|Abstract — Designing {{watermarking}} {{codes that}} can withstand geometric and other desynchronization attacks is a notoriously difficult problem. One may ask whether these difficulties {{are due to}} limitations of current codes, or rather to fundamental limitations on achievable performance. We model the attack channel as the cascade of a memoryless channel and a smooth, invertible mapping Tθ, θ ∈ Θn, representing the <b>geometric</b> attack. The <b>decoder</b> does not known the value of θ. We show that under regularity conditions, there exists a universal decoder for this problem, and we explicitly identify it. I...|$|R
