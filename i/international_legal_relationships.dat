The Convention is the first binding international instrument of its kind related to disability. Its premises differ from the earlier World Programme on Disability, and more closely integrate the frameworks of U. S. domestic equal protection and disability civil rights law. Drawing on critical race and feminist theory, this Article critically examines the implications of internationalizing a U.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{a number of}} {{scholars}} (most notably Anne Peters, Christian Tomuschat, Ruti Teitel and Antônio Augusto Cançado Trindade) have identified an ongoing process {{of change in the}} <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> system’s <b>relationship</b> with individuals and groups of individuals. That change has been referred to as a humanisation of international law. This thesis contributes to that area of study by offering an account of the deep level changes to the foundations of the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> system, which it argues are both driving and are recursively driven by changes in substantive international law. It finds the explanation for these changes in the idea of the self-determination of the individual, and it argues that this concept has now become a structural principle (a term borrowed from Giddens, 1984) of the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> system. The thesis takes a twin methodological approach to the question, using both an analysis of the history of ideas and a sociological lens (particularly Giddens’s theory of structuration) to demonstrate that the foundations of the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> order have changed through time, and that the operation and scope of the system’s basic concepts has altered concomitantly. It argues that the institution of a principle of self-determination as the structural principle of the system is another such change, and one that will produce the kind of changes in the substance and operation of international law that have been identified by Peters and others. Its finding that the interests of individuals and of communities are now embedded in international law at the structural level strongly supports the conclusion that Peters and others have drawn from the examination of substantive international law, that there is a process of humanisation occurring, and that the humanisation process is occurring at all levels within the system...|$|R

It focuses upon the coordination of the Proposal's provisions on jurisdiction and applicable law with the parallel provisions contained in other related EU private international law instruments, namely those relating to divorce (Brussels II bis and Rome III) and succession (Succession Regulation). In doing so, the article adopts a 'stress-test' approach, presenting scenarios in which interaction between these related instruments takes place. The compositions and circumstances of the fictitious couples in these scenarios are varied in order to fully illustrate the potential consequences of the interplay between the instruments. This article seeks to assess {{the extent to which}} (in) consistency exists between the current and proposed EU private international instruments and, by evaluating this interaction through a number of norms, how identified inconsistencies impact upon <b>international</b> couples' <b>legal</b> <b>relationships.</b> In order to ensure the analysis remains as up to date as possible, the article will also take into account relevant changes introduced in the latest revised versions of the Proposal...|$|R

From the title it is obvious that commercial establishment is an object of <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> but not a subject of <b>legal</b> <b>relationship</b> which is a considerable part of its understanding. With the acceptance of the Czech Civil Code a lot of changes came to this institute, including name change. This is the reason why it was necessary to conceive this matter complexly, from the basic term to specifics of particular <b>legal</b> <b>relationships.</b> The first part of this thesis is focussed on a basic term of commercial establishment and its circumscription in the Czech Civil Code, where it is understood as a set of asset and also as an agent for entrepreneurial activities. This part analyses particular kinds of commercial establishment and also branch of another parts of commercial establishment. The second part is dedicated to various examples of <b>legal</b> <b>relationships</b> where the commercial establishment might be the object.

40|$|This chapter, a {{contribution}} to a book on <b>International</b> <b>Legal</b> Positivism in a Post-Modern World, gauges the potential for mutually enriching interactions between <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism and legal realism. It first describes the encounter between legal positivism and legal realism in the U. S. legal academy and then proceeds to discuss {{the rise of a}} new <b>legal</b> realism in <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> theory. In a concluding section, the chapter assesses the compatibilities and tensions between the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realism and the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism. With its forthright embrace of the inescapability of uncertainty in law, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism adopts a sceptical position very similar to legal realism. However, this chapter contends, the new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivism still requires a realist supplement in order to provide a fuller understanding {{of the way in which}} legal norms interact with non-legal factors and to help us describe, predict and analyse the behaviour of actors in international affairs. At the same time, new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> realists can learn from the sceptical attitude towards sources of law that new <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> positivists have developed. The two movements can be symbiotic if brought into closer dialogue. Nonetheless, this chapter concludes with a dose of pessimism about the capacity of any of the currently available theories of international law to fully assimilate the complexities of both postmodern theory and postmodern global society into a comprehensive theory of international law in the postmodern world...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} how the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> {{system may}} be reconstructed through {{the introduction of new}} <b>legal</b> <b>relationships</b> among these principles of international law to encourage different ethnic and religious communities, which rely on the principle of self-determination, and central governments, which invokes the principle of territorial integrity of its state, to make rational choices that will reduce the likelihood of minority/government conflict in the future. Sub-national groups understand self-determination of peoples to include the right of secession which threatens the territorial integrity of a state, while the territorial integrity of a state prohibits self-determination to be understood as statehood. Since the principles of international law, self-determination of peoples and integrity of states have equal international status, this creates legal confusion in political relations, and constrains participants, ethnic groups, and central governments from focusing on primary goals: secession and protection of states 2 ̆ 7 territorial integrity...|$|R
40|$|Non-state {{actors are}} {{increasingly}} being considered <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons on a case-by-case basis. This articles argues that the common thread in making decisions on whether to treat a non-state actor as an <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> person {{is one of the}} function that the actor is playing in relation to other international actors. Gone is the traditional notion that only states are <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons, and it is now well accepted that international organizations are also persons. More controversial is the status of self-determination peoples, National Liberation Movements, indigenous peoples, insurgents, belligerents, combatants, private corporations, non-governmental organizations, religious organizations, and individuals. This article undertakes a survey of practice regarding these actors and the practice shows that they are sometimes considered <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons and sometimes not. While it is tempting to demand that they enjoy consistent, objective status, practice does not support this outcome. Instead, these actors are treated as <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> persons for certain functions, and only for those functions, perhaps also only in relation to other actors where that function is relevant. Thus, <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> personality for non-state actors is relative and functional...|$|R

It is less and less construed as the exclusive genetic code that provides the instructions for the identification and autonomous development of <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> discourses as <b>international</b> lawyers have sought to emancipate themselves from their own genetic heritage. Since {{the second half of}} the 20 th century, many international lawyers have come to feel that <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> discourses ought no longer to be structured and developed around the dichotomy between the ‘legally binding’ and the ‘legally non-binding’.

40|$|States invoke {{cultural}} exceptions as {{justifications for}} derogating from <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> obligations. For example, some developing countries claim cultural exceptions against the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> norm of gender equality {{for women and}} sexual minorities. <b>International</b> <b>legal</b> scholars have debated the universality of human rights, but most implicitly assume that the norm of gender equality, unlike other human rights norms, is bounded by culture. These scholars have ignored the disparate treatment of culture {{in other areas of}} international law. My article maps out the <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> discourse of cultural exceptions. It is not another argument for, or against, cultural exceptions. Rather, it explores the reason for the apparently inconsistent treatment of culture. To this end I examine the legal discourse deployed in two other cultural controversies: The European Union and Canada assert cultural exceptions against the W. T. O. rules that prohibit import barriers to U. S. publications, films and videos. Japan and Norway argue for a cultural exception to justify their rejection of the International Whaling Commission 2 ̆ 7 s ban on whale hunting. In both cases, the international community rejects cultural exceptions to <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> norms. I conclude that cultural exceptions to <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> norms are tolerated only when they facilitate globalization. Globalization causes popular anxieties, which threaten the political consensus for market liberalization. In my view, restrictions on women and sexual minorities represent displaced cultural anxieties. The <b>international</b> <b>legal</b> system permits this derogation from the norm in order to maintain domestic support for globalization...|$|R

First, it affects how local, regional and global communities of humans will be governed. Second, it shapes the manner in which that governance, whatever form it takes, will account to populations for its actions or failures to act.
