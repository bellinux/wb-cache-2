25|$|After a long, painful {{battle with}} infections, {{possibly}} {{brought on by}} his doctors' poking and probing the wound with unwashed hands and non-sterilized instruments, Garfield died on September 19, eleven weeks after being shot. Most modern physicians <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> state that Garfield would have easily recovered from his wounds with sterile medical care, which was common in the United States ten years later, while Candice Millard argues that Garfield would have survived Guiteau's bullet wound had his doctors simply left him alone. Garfield's biographer Allan Peskin stated that medical malpractice did not contribute to Garfield's death; the inevitable infection and blood poisoning that would ensue from a deep bullet wound resulted in damage to multiple organs and spinal bone fragmentation.|$|E
25|$|Stories of heavenly ascents {{were fairly}} {{common in the}} time of Jesus, {{signifying}} the means whereby a prophet could attain access to divine secrets, or divine approval granted to an exceptionally righteous individual, or the deification of an exceptional man. Figures familiar to Jews would have included Enoch (from the Book of Genesis and a popular non-Biblical work called 1 Enoch); the 5th century sage Ezra; Baruch the companion of the prophet Jeremiah (from a work called 2 Baruch, in which Baruch is promised he will ascend to heaven after 40 days); Levi the ancestor of priests; the Teacher of Righteousness from the Qumran community; the prophet Elijah (from 2 Kings); Moses, who was deified on entering heaven; and the children of Job, who according to the Testament of Job ascended heaven following their resurrection from the dead. Non-Jewish readers would have been <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> of the emperor Augustus, whose ascent was witnessed by Senators; Romulus the founder of Rome, who, like Jesus, was taken to heaven in a cloud; the Greek hero Heracles (Hercules); and others.|$|E
25|$|Professor Montagnier, the co-discoverer of the Human Immuno-deficiency Virus (H.I.V), {{testified that}} the virus in the 393 {{children}} studied is a rare type found mostly in West Africa, but also throughout the continent. Montagnier told the court that the outbreak was probably started by an infected child admitted for treatment at the hospital. He said that injection {{was not the only}} possible means of infection, any other manipulation involving penetration of the skin, or even multiple use of the same oxygen mask, could have transmitted the virus. Montagnier was certain that the epidemic at the hospital started about a year before the Bulgarian nurses were hired. He said he was <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> before his first visit to Libya in 1999 because he {{was in the process of}} studying the cases of hundreds of HIV-positive children from El-Fatih that were being examined or treated in hospitals in Switzerland, France, and Italy. At the time he was working on these cases, some of the children did not yet have the symptoms because the incubation period of the virus is about 10 years.|$|E

2500|$|While testifying at the Guantanamo {{military}} commission for alleged child soldier Omar Khadr, FBI agent Robert Fuller testified that Khadr had identified Maher Arar {{as among the}} al-Qaeda militants he met while in Afghanistan. On October 7, 2002, Fuller went to Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan and showed Canadian teenager Omar Khadr a black-and-white photograph of Arar obtained from the FBI office in Massachusetts, and demanded {{to know if he}} recognised him. Khadr initially stated that he did not recognise Arar. Upon cross-examination, Fuller clarified his testimony saying that at first Khadr could not identify Arar. Then after giving him a couple minutes Khadr [...] "stated he felt he had seen" [...] Maher Arar at a Kabul safehouse run by Abu Musab al-Suri or Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. The validity of Omar Khadr's possible sighting has been seriously questioned due to the time frame of the alleged sighting which was sometime during September or October 2001. Arar was known to be in North America during this time frame and under surveillance by the RCMP. Khadr's lawyer told Canadian media that Khadr, claiming to be under torture at Bagram Theater Internment Facility, simply told his captors whatever he thought they wanted to hear.

60|$|The {{preceding}} discussions have rendered us <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>case</b> {{in which}} several agents, or causes, concur as conditions {{to the production}} of an effect; a case, in truth, almost universal, there being very few effects {{to the production of}} which no more than one agent contributes. Suppose, then, that two different agents, operating jointly, are followed, under a certain set of collateral conditions, by a given effect. If either of these agents, instead of being joined with the other, had operated alone, under the same set of conditions in all other respects, some effect would probably have followed, which would have been different from the joint effect of the two, and more or less dissimilar to it. Now, if we happen to know what would be the effect of each cause when acting separately from the other, we are often able to arrive deductively, or a priori, at a correct prediction of what will arise from their conjunct agency. To render this possible, it is only necessary that the same law which expresses the effect of each cause acting by itself, shall also correctly express the part due to that cause of the effect which follows from the two together. This condition is realized in the extensive and important class of phenomena commonly called mechanical, namely the phenomena of the communication of motion (or of pressure, which is tendency to motion) from one body to another. In this important class of cases of causation, one cause never, properly speaking, defeats or frustrates another; both have their full effect. If a body is propelled in two directions by two forces, one tending to drive it to the north and the other to the east, it is caused to move in a given time exactly as far in both directions as the two forces would separately have carried it; and is left precisely where it would have arrived if it had been acted upon first by one of the two forces, and afterward by the other. This law of nature is called, in dynamics, the principle of the Composition of Forces; and in imitation of that well-chosen expression, I shall give the name of the Composition of Causes to the principle which is exemplified in all cases in which the joint effect of several causes is identical with the sum of their separate effects.|$|E

40|$|In this study, {{the writer}} has {{explored}} the Member-Employee Program {{as an intermediate}} step in the rehabilitation or mentally ill patients in Veterans Administration Neuro-Psychiatric Hospitals. The Member-Employee Program has been used effectively at these hospitals to indicate to the staff the readiness, initiative and {{the responsibility of the}} individual patients. The purposes of this study were to determine the roles of the Member-Employee Program in the rehabilitation or the patient, to show the obstacles {{in the path of the}} program and how they have been removed, to show the social worker 2 ̆ 7 s role in the program and to show the effectiveness of the program to help patients in the hospital in which the study was made. The material used in this study was obtained from social service records, clinical records and progress reports of patients an member-employee status. These data were supplemented by conferences with doctors, social workers and others who were <b>familiar</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> <b>cases.</b> Published materials as well as unpublished materials and attendance at some meetings of the Medical Rehabilitation Board provided background information and framework for interpretation. This study included twenty-five patients which was the total number placed on member-employee status at the hospital where the study was made, during the first year of the program 2 ̆ 7 s inception. The program was one year old on November 1, 1954. As a result of this study, the following conclusions were derived: The insistence on total rehabilitation so that an individual is restored 2 ̆ 2 to a station of independent earning power 2 ̆ 2 (Webster 2 ̆ 7 s definition) is an indication of an inflexibility which can be detrimental in the 2 treatment of the mentally ill. Moreover, it is a denial of differences among individuals and of the societal dicta to which we conform. An ability to compromise, to lower goals and to decrease pressures so that a sick person can move out of an institutional setting and live in a community and participate in its functions within the limits of his shortcomings is rehabilitation in the psychiatric sense, if not in accord <b>with</b> <b>the</b> dictionary definition. An examination of the Member-Employee Program as it developed at this hospital offers a valuable lesson in administration and in human understanding for similar institutions interested in organizing such a program. A treatment program must have a philosophy and a purpose and must approach attainable goals periodically as a program and for each patient served by it. From its inception, the Member-Employee Program was faced by many obstacles in its path and as each was hurdled, philosophy and purpose began to materialize. A year from its inception, the Member-Employee Program, and its functioning arm, the Medical Rehabilitation Board, have become a definite and entrenched part of the hospital 2 ̆ 7 s treatment and rehabilitative facilities. Statistics for so young a program are meager but the fact that only four of the twenty-five patients placed on member-employee status during the first year of the program were removed and returned to patient status, leads the writer to feel that the Member-Employee Program manifests more positive factors than negative factors in the adjustment of psychotic patients. The fact that some patients were able to move out of the hospital and others were able to remain on member-employee status after resolving their problems and fears through participation in the program and other patients were unable to accomplish such movement, indicates further that some patients are not able to benefit through this program and that perhaps further study should be made regardi. ng the values of the program as a therapeutic tool in order to screen more closely the patients chosen to be member-employees.
