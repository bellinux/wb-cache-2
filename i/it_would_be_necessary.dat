5|$|Once the Regular Army {{had been}} {{organised}} as a continental Expeditionary Force, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to provide forces for home defence. Haldane's proposal {{anticipated that the}} existing tripartite division of the Army - the Regular Army, the Volunteers/Yeomanry and the Militia - should be changed into a two-part structure, with an Expeditionary Force and a home-defence Territorial Force based on County Associations.|$|E
5|$|The {{shipping}} line operations of Cunard didn't escape review by Smallpeice. He was already {{familiar with the}} containerisation of freight prior to taking up his position with Cunard, but spent time during 1966 to visit the Sea-Land Service container terminal at Port Newark and further familiarised himself {{with the use of}} containers in marine traffic. Container ships were considered too large for the traditional British {{shipping line}}s, including Cunard and their subsidiaries to operate, so <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to form partnerships.|$|E
5|$|Elephant Island was remote, uninhabited, {{and rarely}} visited by whalers {{or any other}} ships. If the party was to return to civilization <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to summon help. The only {{realistic}} way this could be done was to adapt one of the lifeboats for an 800-mile (1,300km) voyage across the Southern Ocean, to South Georgia. Shackleton had abandoned thoughts of taking the party on the less dangerous journey to Deception Island, because of the poor physical condition {{of many of his}} party. Port Stanley in the Falkland Islands was closer than South Georgia, but could not be reached, as this would require sailing against the strong prevailing winds.|$|E

5|$|Rosenborg had {{originally}} planned to build additional commercial facilities and a tower hotel during the 2002 construction, {{but this was}} canceled. At the 2011 annual meeting, the plans were again launched by Skutle, who stated that construction might start as early as 2011. In March 2005, Rosenborg announced {{plans to build a}} retractable roof over the pitch and lay artificial turf. The roof was estimated to cost NOK100 million, and the club estimated that it could generate NOK30 million per year in increased revenue from concerts and events. By 2007, the roof plans were delayed, with management stating that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to complete the construction of all stands before a roof was built, and that they believed the stadium would soon be expanded.|$|E
5|$|Shackleton's {{original}} {{intention was}} to sail down to Cape Town, visiting the main South Atlantic islands on the way. From Cape Town, Quest would head for the Enderby Land coast of Antarctica where, once in the ice, it would explore the coastline towards Coats Land in the Weddell Sea. At {{the end of the}} summer season the ship would visit South Georgia before returning to Cape Town for refitting and preparation for the second year's work. The ship's performance in the early stages of the voyage disrupted this schedule. Serious problems with the engine necessitated a week's stay in Lisbon, and further stops in Madeira and the Cape Verde Islands. These delays and the slow speed of the ship led Shackleton to decide that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to sacrifice entirely the visits to the South Atlantic islands, and instead he turned the ship towards Rio de Janeiro, where the engine could receive a thorough overhaul. Quest reached Rio on 22 November 1921.|$|E
5|$|The root of {{the trouble}} was an {{economic}} crisis—initiated by the Panic of 1837—which was entering its sixth year in 1842. A speculative bubble had burst in 1836–39, causing a collapse of the financial sector and a subsequent depression. The country became deeply divided over the best response to the crisis. Conditions got even worse in early 1842 because a deadline was looming. A decade earlier, when the economy was strong, Congress had promised Southern states {{that there would be}} a reduction in hated federal tariffs. Northern states welcomed tariffs, which protected their infant industries. But the South had no industrial base and depended on open access to British markets for their cotton. In a recommendation to Congress, Tyler lamented that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to override the Compromise Tariff of 1833 and raise rates beyond the 20 percent limit. Under the previous deal, this would suspend the distribution program, with all revenues going to the federal government.|$|E

5|$|As {{test flights}} {{conducted}} by No. 617 Squadron proved {{that it was}} not possible to make a return trip to Kaafjord from Scotland, and an evaluation of the main airstrip in the Shetlands determined that it was unsuitable for Lancasters, No. 5 Group's staff officers judged that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for the aircraft to refuel in the Soviet Union. Detailed investigation of the airstrips near Murmansk found that they were at best marginal for heavy bombers and had almost no accommodation or aircraft servicing facilities. Moreover, the airstrips were vulnerable to attack from fighters operating from nearby German bases. Instead, it was decided that the attack force should fly over northern Sweden and Finland after raiding Kaafjord and refuel at Yagodnik airstrip, which was located on an island near Arkhangelsk. This plan was accepted by the Air Ministry on 6 September. Soviet Naval Aviation offered to attack German fighter bases at the same time as the British bombers arrived over the target area, but No. 5 Group rejected this proposal and requested that Soviet aircraft not fly near Kaafjord, to avoid alerting the Germans.|$|E
5|$|In 2003, Telemark County Municipality had {{attempted}} to create a PSO contract for {{the operation of the}} Bratsberg Line, that had been transferred from the state to the county. Five private companies had bid, but all five had been disqualified and the county was forced to sign a concession contract with NSB instead, despite NSB not having bid in the tender. The same year, the national process was delayed one year. However, the government announced that the bidding would happen in three stages; first the Gjøvik Line and Bergen Commuter Rail, second the long-distance trains as well as the Trøndelag Commuter Rail, and finally the rest of the Oslo Commuter Rail, as well as the Jæren Commuter Rail. Among the challenges was the ownership of the rolling stock and depots. The department considered creating a separate government-owned company that would own these. Since NSB had been converted to a limited company, <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> for the state to purchase the trains and depots for full price from NSB. With 69 multiple units delivered within the past five years, this could become an expensive transaction for the state. An alternative was launched were NSB would have to lease locomotives, carriages and multiple units to the winner, and also sell tickets for them at railway stations, a solution that was later chosen. In September 2004, it was announced that current employees working for NSB along the Gjøvik Line would have the right to work for the winner, and could demand the same wage and pension rights as before.|$|E
25|$|Realistically, {{the set of}} ravens is finite. The set of non-black {{things is}} either {{infinite}} or beyond human enumeration. In order to confirm the statement 'All ravens are black', <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to observe all ravens. This is difficult but possible. In order to confirm the statement 'All non-black things are non-ravens', <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to examine all non-black things. This is not possible. Observing a black raven {{could be considered a}} finite amount of confirmatory evidence, but observing a non-black non-raven would be an infinitesimal amount of evidence.|$|E

Stabilising greenhouse gas concentrations at 450ppm would only result in a 50% likelihood of limiting global warming to 2°C, and that <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> <b>necessary</b> to achieve stabilisation below 400ppm to give a relatively high certainty of not exceeding 2°C.|$|E
25|$|Local {{politicians}} {{have proposed that}} Kautokeino Airport be rebuilt as a regional airport. In 2007 a unison municipal council supported an upgrade to the airport.

The airport counter-argued that the codeshare would stifle competition and passenger growth on Wellington's international flights, pointing to what it saw as a market duopoly dominated by Air New Zealand and Qantas. The codeshare was abandoned by the two airlines after it was rejected in a draft ruling by the ACCC in November 2006.|$|E
