50|$|Spillover {{effect can}} be defined as an {{apparent}} gain <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> for small objects or regions, as opposed to the partial volume effect.

Although partial volume effect and spillover refer to essentially the same physical problem, it is important to distinguish the outcome of these two different effects. For partial volume effect, the apparent loss of <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> the object is distributed across adjacent voxels, which are considered outside the object, resulting <b>in</b> increase <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> <b>in</b> these voxels. This increase <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> is referred to as spillover, whereas loss <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> is referred to as partial volume loss.|$|R

5|$|During the story, Tommy meets {{characters}} from various gangs. As the player completes missions for different gangs, fellow gang members will often defend the player, while rival gang members will recognise the player and subsequently shoot on sight. While free roaming the game world, the player may engage <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> {{such as a}} vigilante minigame, a fire fighting activity, and a taxi cab service. Completion of these activities grants the player with context-specific rewards. As Tommy builds his criminal empire, the player may purchase a number of properties distributed across the city, some of which act as additional hideouts where weapons can be collected and vehicles can be stored. There are also a variety of businesses which can be purchased, including a film studio, a taxi company, and several entertainment clubs. Each commercial property {{has a number of}} missions attached to it, such as eliminating competition or stealing equipment; once all missions are complete, the property begins to generate an ongoing income available for the player.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{estimate}} the serum levels of IgG, IgM, and IgA in nephrotic syndrome (NS) cases, <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> or <b>in</b> remission, and to detect their levels in relation to steroid response by evelautingthe relationship between IgG/IgM ratio and response to steroids. We investigated 27 cases with NS <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>in</b> remission and 20 healthy children as controls. Group A included 16 NS patients (12. 3 ± 1. 4 years) who were steroid-resistant, frequent relapsers, or steroid dependent. Group B included 11 steroid-sensitive NS patients with a mean age of 11. 6 ± 2. 1 years. Group C included 20 healthy children with a mean age of 12. 1 ± 2. 3 years who were the control group. We found lower serum IgG level in NS cases compared with the control group; and it was lower <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> than <b>in</b> remission. The levels were lower in Group A compared with those of Group B. Serum IgG levels in Group A were as follows: <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> 2. 29 ± 1. 13 g/L and in remission, 4. 3 ± 2 g/L. In Group B, they were 6. 2 ± 1. 2 g/L and 6. 5 ± 1. 15 g/L <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>in</b> remission, respectively, and 11. 8 ± 2. 5 g/L in the healthy control group (P< 0. 05). There was a direct correlation between serum albumin and serum IgG. We found no significant difference in serum IgM and IgA levels among studied groups whether <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> or <b>in</b> remission. Serum IgG/IgM ratio was lower <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and <b>in</b> remission in the patient groups than in the control group as it was 9. 3 ± 4. 7 in healthy subjects. It was 1. 8 ± 1. 5 in Group A <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and 3. 2 ± 2 in remission, and in Group B 4. 8 ± 2. 39 <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> and 4. 8 ± 2. 4 in remission. We conclude that IgM and IgA show no significant difference in NS patients. Serum IgG is lower in NS than in the control group and is much lower <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> than <b>in</b> remission. It is lower in patients with poor steroid response. We propose a predictive value of IgG/IgM ratio <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> that is, the higher the IgG/IgM ratio <b>in</b> <b>activity,</b> the better the prognosis...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo examine changes <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> {{participation}} following abatacept {{treatment for}} rheumatoid arthritis (RA), and which factors contributed to such changes. MethodsData were analyzed from the Abatacept in Inadequate responders to Methotrexate (AIM) and Abatacept Trial in Treatment of Anti-TNF INadequate responders (ATTAIN) clinical trials of abatacept {{in patients with}} RA. Activity participation was evaluated by the validated Activity Participation Questionnaire (APaQ), along with measures of clinical response and health-related quality of life. Changes in the APaQ during the two study periods were compared between treatment groups. Multiple regression analyses were performed to investigate the determinants of change <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> participation. The relationship between clinical efficacy measures (including low disease activity state [LDAS], Disease Activity Score 28 -defined remission, and European League Against Rheumatism [EULAR] responses) and changes <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> participation were investigated. ResultsStatistically significant, substantive improvements <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> participation were observed over the entire study period in patients treated with abatacept. Abatacept-treated patients showed improvements from baseline of 8. 4 and 7. 3 days <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> participation, compared with 4. 5 and 1. 4 days {{in the placebo group}} (P < 0. 005 vs. placebo in both trials), at the end of AIM and ATTAIN, respectively.

Patients who achieved LDAS, disease remission and good EULAR responses experienced greater improvements <b>in</b> <b>activity</b> participation measures.

5|$|In 1929, the Boy Scouts Association {{hosted the}} 3rd World Scout Jamboree at Arrowe Park in Cheshire; some 56,000 Scouts from 35 {{countries}} attended, {{making it the}} largest World Scout Jamboree to date. The first Gang Show, produced by Ralph Reader, opened at the Scala Theatre in London in October 1932. Following the outbreak of World War II, over 50,000 Scouts trained under the National War Service scheme. Tasks undertaken included police messengers and stretcher bearers. The Air Scout branch was launched in January 1941, allowing Scout Troops to specialise <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> related to aircraft and flying. Lord Baden-Powell died in 1941 and was succeeded as the association's Chief Scout by Lord Somers.

5|$|On the {{practical}} side, microbes {{have been used}} <b>in</b> <b>activities</b> from biological warfare to fermentation in food processing; bread, beer and wine have been produced by yeasts from the dawn of civilisation, such as in ancient Egypt. Microorganisms such as bacteria and viruses are important as pathogens, causing disease to humans, crop plants, and domestic animals. Fermentation is {{an important source of}} chemicals, as industrial chemists discover how to manufacture a widening variety of organic chemicals including enzymes and bioactive molecules such as hormones and competitive inhibitors for use as medicines. Fermentation is used, too, to produce substitutes for fossil fuels in forms such as ethanol and methane; fuels may also be produced by algae. Anaerobic microorganisms are important in sewage treatment. In scientific research, yeasts serve as model organisms especially in genetics and related fields.|$|E

5|$|The {{forest at}} Ambohimanga benefited from {{customary}} protection and today represents {{the largest of}} the last remaining fragments of primary forest that formerly covered the highlands. It contains a representative assortment of native tree and plant species, in particular the endemic tree zahana (phyllarthron madagascariensis) and a variety of indigenous medicinal plants, many possessing traditional or spiritual importance. Examples include the native bush Anthocleista, traditionally believed to attract lightning and often planted in clusters beside villages; the Dracaena plant, traditionally used for hedges and planted at sacred sites in valleys or other natural features where people would come to communicate with ancestral spirits; and the Phyllarthron vine, which was planted in sacred thickets and harvested for its wood, which was traditionally used to fashion handles for diverse tools.
