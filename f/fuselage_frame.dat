25|$|The Aircraft Historical Museum, Sola, Norway, has {{on display}} an Ar 196 A-2 <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> raised from {{the wreck of}} the German cruiser Blücher in Oslofjord.|$|E
25|$|The {{aircraft}} fuselage {{was made}} from welded steel tubing, while the wings had wooden spars and ribs covered in doped aircraft fabric. Several prefabricated components were supplied {{as part of the}} kit, including the <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame,</b> landing gear, engine mount and tail assembly. The manufacturer rated the STA kit as suitable for beginners and estimated the construction time from the supplied kit as 1500hours. The kit could be completed to represent an STA, a military PT-16 or a PT-20.|$|E
2500|$|The {{aircraft}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> is {{made from}} bolted-together aluminum tubing and has a [...] diameter two-bladed rotor. The aircraft has an empty weight of [...] and a gross weight of , giving a useful load of [...] With full fuel of [...] the maximum pilot weight is [...]|$|E
50|$|Construction {{techniques}} {{used in the}} company's products included welded 4130 steel <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> covered in either doped aircraft fabric or in a shell of polyurethane foam and fiberglass.|$|R
50|$|The various <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> are {{interchangeable}} and any can {{be added}} to the same basic wing. Swift gliders with engines have Arplast EcoProp folding propellers, which feather for soaring when then engine is turned off. Powered Swift gliders are not foot-launched, having instead two main wheels in tandem layout, and small wing-tip castors.|$|R

2500|$|Construction was {{the common}} one of canvas over a metal frame, but the <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> was quite novel. It was {{designed}} by Vickers' chief structural engineer, Barnes Wallis and was a step {{along the road to}} his geodetic frames, where the distinction between main and secondary members was largely lost. The Type 207 <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> had four light-alloy longerons, each made in sections that were screwed together. These longerons were joined by a pair of oppositely handed helical channel members, forming a diagonal tubular mesh. [...] Wing construction was less radical, and indeed less novel than that of the earlier Type 207, which had thick RAF34 section wings built of complex webbing informed by Wallis' earlier airship experience; the Type 253 reverted to the thinner RAF15 section and a more familiar two spar design.|$|E
2500|$|The Doppelraab {{appeared}} in {{public for the}} first time at the first postwar Wasserkuppe competition, held in 1951. [...] It was enthusiastically received, Hanna Reitsch saying that it was [...] "a dream of an aircraft". Its thermal soaring was judged competitive with the Grunau Baby. After a year twelve were flying with fifty in production; final production was close to four hundred. Serial production was handled by Wolf Hirth; both kits and finished aircraft were available. [...] The forward <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> was factory welded in either case. [...] After gaining experience with his instructor, a pupil could fly the Doppelraab solo to gain his early badges, minimising the club's costs.|$|E
2500|$|Boulton & Paul were {{encouraged}} by the responses {{to go ahead with}} a production version, the Phoenix II. This used the same flight surfaces but had a spot welded steel <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame.</b> [...] When covered this had much the same shape as the earlier wooden one apart from the nose, where a [...] uncowled nine-cylinder Salmson radial replaced the ABC. There were changes to the minor struts including those at the centre section, with the struts ahead of the cockpits gone; but the most obvious alteration was to the undercarriage. The main wheels were now on wing mounted vertical legs, each on a stub axle that had a pair of vee struts to the lower fuselage; the revised aircraft sat higher above the ground. The Phoenix II, still registered as G-AAIT made its first flight on 12 June 1930 and this was followed by another period of amateur testing. Despite its low price the Phoenix failed to attract buyers aiming below the Moth and no further machines were built. G-AAIT remained in use as Rea's personal hack until the end of 1935.|$|E
50|$|The Wibault 220 had fixed, {{conventional}} {{landing gear}} with its mainwheels on V-struts hinged to the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames.</b> The wheels were positioned below the engines, {{to which they were}} connected by vertical Messier oleo legs so that the track was a generous 4.80 m. The tailskid also had a Messier shock absorber and was steerable.|$|R
50|$|The factory of S. Poite {{was well}} known to French {{aircraft}} manufacturers for its expertise in welded light metal structures, particularly their fuel tanks but also <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> {{such as that of}} the Bodiansky 20. The Poite 3 is the only known aircraft carrying the factory's name. It was designed by M. Tétart and was an all-metal aircraft.|$|R
50|$|Its {{tailskid}} {{landing gear}} was fixed, with each mainwheel {{on its own}} bent axle from the central fuselage underside and with drag struts back to the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames.</b> Short, near vertical, rubber shock absorber legs stood between the wheels and the forward spar at the extreme edge of the wing centre section. The tailskid was a steel tube with a wooden shoe.|$|R
2500|$|The core of {{the flat}} frame {{fuselage}} was formed with a horizontal beam about [...] long, to which two other [...] converging struts were attached, making overall a vertical A-frame. The downward sloping extremities of these beams carried a slightly deeper horizontal box structure below the cross beam, with the open pilot's seat and controls upon it. On some later aircraft there was an extra vertical member for the lower cross beam to the wing root to provide the pilot with a backrest. [...] Others enclosed him or her in a simple, light, short nacelle between the nose and the backrest strut. The rear part of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> was based on two longer beams reaching to the tail. [...] The upper one was horizontal and attached to both converging A-frame beams, near but not at its apex. The lower one sloped upwards and {{was attached to the}} rear sloping part of the A-frame just below the cross-member. [...] These two rear fuselage beams were cross braced with three more struts, one vertical about halfway to the tail, forming two bays which were crossed diagonally by the other two struts. [...] There was another, short vertical strut in the rear bay between the upper and diagonal members. [...] For landings a skid ran between three projecting ends of the forward and lower A-frame.|$|E
2500|$|The {{structure}} of the Descamps A2 was all metal. Such designs were quite new at this time and were criticised as being more difficult to repair compared with wooden-framed machines but Brunet's design enabled any part to be exchanged rapidly. It had no wire bracing and required no rigging. The A2 was a sesquiplane, with an upper wing with twice the span and 3.4 times {{the area of the}} lower one, which was not only short but narrow. [...] The two wings had similar plans, rectangular apart from straight angled tips. Only the upper wing carried ailerons. Both wings were built around two I-section spars and were braced together on each side by two sets of airfoil section, N-form interplane struts, one from the upper fuselage to mid-way along the lower wing and the other from there outwards to the upper wing. [...] There was significant stagger, with {{the leading edge of the}} lower wing ahead of that of the upper, so the N-struts leaned backwards. There was no dihedral on the lower wing but the upper one was set at 1.5° and slightly swept (2°). [...] The lower wing was mounted on the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> and the upper on a very short upper fuselage pillar. [...] The wings, like the rest of the aircraft, were fabric covered.|$|E

500|$|The A319 is {{the next}} {{derivative}} of the baseline A320. The design is a [...] "shrink" [...] with its origins in the 130- to 140-seat SA1, part of the Single-Aisle studies. The SA1 was shelved as the consortium concentrated on its bigger siblings. After healthy sales of the A320/A321, Airbus re-focused on what was then known as the A320M-7, meaning A320 minus seven <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames.</b> It would provide direct competition for the 737–300/-700. The shrink was achieved through the removal of four <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> fore and three aft of the wing, cutting the overall length by [...] [...] Consequently, the number of overwing exits was reduced from four to two.

50|$|It had fixed {{tailwheel}} {{landing gear}} with a track of 2.4 m. The mainwheels, equipped with brakes, were independently mounted on bent axles hinged {{from the central}} fuselage and restrained by drag struts from the forward lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames.</b> Each wheel had a short, vertical oleo strut from the forward part of the outer end of the wing centre-section. The tailwheel castored and was sprung and damped with rubber rings.|$|R

40|$|The {{focus of}} {{research}} activities under NASA Grant NAG- 1 - 2035 was the response and failure of thin-walled structural components. The research is {{applicable to the}} primary load carrying structure of flight vehicles, with particular emphasis on fuselage and wing'structure. Analyses and tests were performed that are applicable to the following structural components an aft pressure bulkhead, or a composite pressure dome, pressure cabin damage containment, and <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> subject to crash-type loads...|$|R
40|$|In {{aerospace}} structures {{it is common}} to find stiffened panels with transverse supporting structures, e. g. wing ribs or <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames.</b> Incorporating cutouts into these supporting structures to allow the stringers to pass through freely considerably reduces the buckling load of the panels. It is shown that a minor modification in the fabrication of the stiffened panel gives most of the advantages of cutouts while still giving a buckling load close to that of a panel with no cutouts...|$|R
50|$|The Aircraft Historical Museum, Sola, Norway, has {{on display}} an Ar 196 A-2 <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> raised from {{the wreck of}} the German cruiser Blücher in Oslofjord.|$|E
50|$|It had a {{one-piece}} wing of rectangular plan out to semi-elliptical {{tips and}} built around two spruce spars and plywood ribs. There was no dihedral. The leading edge was ply covered, with fabric elsewhere. The centre-section was joined {{to the upper}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame</b> by internal, vertical struts and the wing braced on each side with a parallel pair of streamlined steel tubes between the wing spars and the lower <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame.</b> Its short, broad ailerons were metal framed, fabric covered apart from duralumin leading edges and externally mass-balanced.|$|E
50|$|The Bryan Model I {{was built}} with a welded steel tube <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame,</b> wings from a Briegleb BG-6 primary glider and a Crosley {{automobile}} engine, which was later {{replaced by a}} 40 hp Continental.|$|E
40|$|Experimental and {{analytical}} {{results are presented}} {{of the effects of}} floor placement on the structural response and strength of I-cross section, semi-circular <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> constructed of graphite-epoxy composite material. The composite frame configuration is representative of current conventional aircraft design. Experimental strain distributions are presented from static loading tests of the composite frames and compared with finite element structural models and closed form solutions. An understanding of floor location effects can aid dynamists in predicting the crash behavior of these conventional structures, and may assist the designer in developing crashworthy structures for future aircraft...|$|R
50|$|The {{fuselage}} of the Belfast was {{a relatively}} conservatively-stressed cylinder of a conventional design. It was developed with a target safe-life of 15,000 pressure cycles, which was fatigued tested using a complete fuselage emerged in a water tank. Fail-safe principles {{were used in the}} design of the large side door, rear ramp and door. Rolled Z-sections were used throughout the majority of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> and stringers, while box beams are used where the exertion of heavier-than-average loads had been typically anticipated; the structure lacks any use of forgings or machined members.|$|R

50|$|The {{front and}} rear wings were fixed to a long, {{uncovered}} <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame,</b> with the front wing gently tapered. The top wing was strut-braced to the structure below. Side curtains between the two full-span wings were initially fitted.|$|E
50|$|The C 17 had a fixed, {{tailskid}} undercarriage {{with the}} mainwheels 1.0 m apart on a faired axle. The axle was mounted on V-struts from the outer, lower tubes of the <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame,</b> one transversely to its centre and two longitudinal pairs to its ends.|$|E
50|$|The {{monoplane}} {{was modeled}} after a Blériot XI. The monoplane {{is an open}} framed aircraft with wire-braced fabric covered wings and conventional landing gear, powered by a Detroit aero engine. The <b>fuselage</b> <b>frame,</b> spars, and ribs are made of wood. Roll control was performed with wing-warping.|$|E
25|$|Airbus {{suggested}} Boeing's use of {{composite materials}} for the 787 fuselage was premature, and that the new A350 XWB was to feature large carbon fibre panels for the main fuselage skin. After facing criticism for maintenance costs, Airbus confirmed in early September 2007 the adoption of composite <b>fuselage</b> <b>frames</b> for the aircraft structure. The composite frames would feature aluminium strips to ensure the electrical continuity of the fuselage (for dissipating lightning strikes). Airbus will use a full mock up fuselage to develop the wiring, a different approach from the A380, on which the wiring was all done on computers.|$|R
