In this contribution, we propose a method that addresses the possible alignment problem of the TOF-PET emission data and the computed tomography (CT) attenuation data, by combining reconstruction and registration. The method, called MLRR, iteratively reconstructs the activity image while registering the available CT-based <b>attenuation</b> <b>image,</b> so that the pair of activity and <b>attenuation</b> <b>images</b> maximise {{the likelihood of the}} TOF emission sinogram. The algorithm is slow to converge, but some acceleration could be achieved by using Nesterov's momentum method and by applying a multi-resolution scheme for the non-rigid displacement estimation. The latter also helps to avoid local optima, although convergence to the global optimum cannot be guaranteed. The results are evaluated on 2 D and 3 D simulations as well as a respiratory gated clinical scan.

40|$|Abstract — The low-IF {{receiver}} is very attractive, {{because the}} need for an analog image rejection filter is avoided. Instead, the image rejection is realized by I/Q signal processing. However, unavoidable imbalances between the I- and Q-branch in the analog part of the receiver result in a limited <b>image</b> <b>attenuation.</b> In previous work a blind I/Q imbalance compensation scheme for low-IF receivers was presented and its performance was analyzed. However, the impact of the analog-to-digital conversion (ADC) was not taken into consideration. In particular, the quantization noise, which is unavoidable in practical implementations, has been neglected. In this paper this blind I/Q imbalance compensation scheme is analyzed regarding to its sensitivity to an imperfect ADC. It can be shown by means of analysis as well as simulation, that the compensation scheme is robust against ADC effects. I...|$|E

30|$|Machine {{learning}} {{approaches have}} previously been proposed to estimate attenuation maps. A few pilot studies utilizing neural network methods have shown promising results in PET/MR imaging [9]. These studies typically {{rely on the}} inputs of T 1 -weighted MR images [10, 11], ultrashort-echo time MR images and transmission images [12] to estimate pseudo-CTs which {{can be applied to}} PET attenuation correction. More recently, deep learning approaches using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) have been applied to medical imaging with successful implementations across a diverse range of applications [13]. Deep learning methods are more advanced forms of neural networks and utilizing many levels of network structures capable of learning image features by a series of image convolution processes [14]. One recent study used deep learning to generate discrete pseudo-CTs for PET/MR attenuation correction using a single T 1 -weighted head image, which significantly reduced PET error in an evaluation dataset of ten brain images in comparison with vendor-provided segmentation- and atlas-based methods [15]. However, in all previous studies, besides PET data, additional acquisitions of either MR images or transmission images were required inputs. In this study, we propose a novel automated PET <b>image</b> <b>attenuation</b> correction approach, deepAC, that allows generation of a continuously valued pseudo-CT using only a non-attenuation-corrected (NAC) PET image as input. To the best of our knowledge, this proposed method is the first pilot study performing PET attenuation correction utilizing a self-regularized approach. The feasibility of this new approach is demonstrated in the human brain utilizing 18 F-FDG PET/CT datasets and is compared to reconstruction utilizing the acquired CT. Given the favorable results of deepAC, we expect deep learning-based approaches to have a substantial impact to maintain accurate PET reconstruction while reducing the ionizing radiation dose and increasing the resilience to subject motion.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to demonstrate the feasibility of needle-based optical coherence tomography (OCT) and functional analysis of OCT data along the full pullback trajectory of the OCT measurement in the prostate, correlated with pathology. OCT images were recorded using a commercially available C 7 -XR(TM) OCT Intravascular Imaging System interfaced to a C 7 Dragonfly(TM) intravascular 0. 9 -mm-diameter imaging probe. A computer program was constructed for automated <b>image</b> <b>attenuation</b> analysis. First, calibration of the OCT system for both the point spread function and the system roll-off was achieved by measurement of the OCT signal attenuation from an extremely weakly scattering medium (Intralipid(R) 0. 0005 volume%). Second, the data were arranged in 31 radial wedges (pie slices) per circular segments consisting of 16 A-scans per wedge and 5 axial B-scans, resulting in an average A-scan per wedge. Third, the decay of the OCT signal is analyzed over 50 pixels (500 mu m) in depth, starting from the first found maximum data point. Fourth, for visualization, the data were grouped with a corresponding color representing a specific mu(oct) range according to their attenuation coefficient. Finally, the analyses were compared to histopathology. To ensure that each single use sterile imaging probe is comparable to the measurements of the other imaging probes, the probe-to-probe variations were analyzed by measuring attenuation coefficients of 0. 03, 6. 5, 11. 4, 17, and 22. 7 volume% Intralipid(R). Experiments were repeated five times per probe for four probes. Inter-and intraprobe variation in the measured attenuation of Intralipid samples with scattering properties similar to that of the prostate was < 8 % of the mean values. Mean attenuation coefficients in the prostate were 3. 8 mm(- 1) for parts of the tissue that were classified as benign (SD: 0. 8 mm(- 1), minimum: 2. 2 mm(- 1), maximum: 8. 9 mm(- 1)) and 4. 1 mm(- 1) for parts of tissue that were classified as malignant (SD: 1. 2 mm(- 1), minimum: 2. 5 mm(- 1), maximum: 9. 0 mm(- 1)). In benign areas, the tissue looked homogeneous, whereas in malignant areas, small glandular structures were seen. However, not all areas in which a high attenuation coefficient became apparent corresponded to areas of prostate cancer. This paper describes the first in-tissue needle-based OCT imaging and three-dimensional optical attenuation analysis of prostate tissue that indicates a correlation with pathology. Fully automated attenuation coefficient analysis was performed at 1300 nm over the full pullback. Correlation with pathology was achieved by coregistration of three-dimensional (3 -D) OCT attenuation maps with 3 -D pathology of the prostate. This may contribute to the current challenge of prostate imaging and the rising interest in focal therapy for reduction of side effects occurring with current therapies. (C) The Authors.

A diluted collector mirror, deployed in space as a flotilla of small mirrors, focuses a sky image which is exploited by several beam-combiner spaceships. Each contains a pupil densifier micro-lens array to avoid the diffractive spread and <b>image</b> <b>attenuation</b> caused by the small sub-apertures. The elucidation of hypertelescope imaging properties {{during the last decade}} has shown that many small apertures tend to be far more efficient, regarding the science yield, than a few large ones providing a comparable collecting area. For similar underlying physical reasons, radio-astronomy has also evolved in the direction of many-antenna systems such as the proposed Low Frequency Array having hundreds of thousands of individual receivers. With its high limiting magnitude, reaching the mv= 30 limit of HST when 100 collectors of 25 cm will match its collecting area, high-resolution direct imaging in multiple channels, broad spectral coverage from the 1200 Angstrom ultra-violet to the 20 micron infra-red, apodization, coronagraphic and spectroscopic capabilities, the proposed hypertelescope observatory addresses very broad and innovative science covering different areas of ESA s Cosmic Vision program. In the initial phase, a focal spacecraft covering the UV to near IR spectral range of EMCCD photon-counting cameras (currently 200 to 1000 nm), will image details on the surface of many stars, as well as their environment, including multiple stars and clusters. Spectra will be obtained for each resel. It will also image neutron star, black-hole and micro-quasar candidates, as well as active galactic nuclei, quasars, gravitational lenses, and other Cosmic Vision targets observable with the initial modest crowding limit. With subsequent upgrade missions, the spectral coverage can be extended from 120 nm to 20 microns, using four detectors carried by two to four focal spacecraft. The number of collector mirrors in the flotilla can also be increased from 12 to 100 and possibly 1, 000. The imaging and spectroscopy of habitable exoplanets in the mid infra-red then becomes feasible once the collecting area reaches 6 m 2, using a specialized mid infra-red focal spacecraft. Calculations (Boccaletti et al., 2000) have shown that hypertelescope coronagraphy has unequalled sensitivity for detecting, at mid infra-red wavelengths, faint exoplanets within the exo-zodiacal glare. Later upgrades will enable the more difficult imaging and spectroscopy of these faint objects at visible wavelengths, using refined techniques of adaptive coronagraphy (Labeyrie. & Le Coroller, 2004). Together, the infra-red and visible spectral data carry rich information on the possible presence of life. The close environment of the central black-hole in the Milky Way will be imageable with unprecedented detail in the near infra-red. Cosmological imaging of remote galaxies at the limit of the known universe is also expected, from the ultra-violet to the near infra-red, following the first upgrade, and with greatly increasing sensitivity through successive upgrades. These areas will indeed greatly benefit from the upgrades, in terms of dynamic range, limiting complexity of the objects to be imaged, size of the elementary Direct Imaging Field, and limiting magnitude, approaching that of an 8 -meter space telescope when 1000 apertures of 25 cm are installed. Similar gains will occur for addressing fundamental problems in physics and cosmology, particularly when observing neutron stars and black holes, single or binary, including the giant black holes, with accretion disks and jets, in active galactic nuclei beyond the Milky Way. Gravitational lensing and micro-lensing patterns, including time-variable patterns and perhaps millisecond lensing flasheshich may be beamed by diffraction from sub-stellar masses at sub-parsec distances (Labeyrie, 1994), will also be observable initially in the favourable cases, and upgrades will greatly improve the number of observable objects. The observability of gravitational waves emitted by binary lensing masses, in the form of modulated lensing patterns, is a debated issue (Ragazzoni et al., 2003) but will also become addressable observationally. The technology readiness of Luciola approaches levels where low-orbit testing and stepwise implementation will become feasible in the 2015 - 2025 time frame. For the following decades beyond 2020, once accurate formation flying techniques will be mastered, much larger hypertelescopes such as the proposed 100 km Exo-Earth Imager and the 100, 000 km Neutron Star Imager should also become feasible. Luciola is therefore also seen as a precursor toward such very powerful instruments...|$|E

30|$|It is also {{necessary}} to underline that this study uses a perfectly matching <b>attenuation</b> <b>image</b> to correct for attenuation during the PET measurement. In a previous study [10], we proved {{that the use of}} a mismatched <b>attenuation</b> <b>image</b> can affect the subsequent PVC of the PET dataset with anatomical information in two ways. Firstly, the use of a mismatched attenuation correction can create fake, hypo-active areas in the LV depending on the direction and the amount of the displacement of the AC CT relative to the PET dataset. This could result by itself in errors in the quantification of the (lesions in the) LV. In addition, the correction of the PET dataset with a mismatched <b>attenuation</b> <b>image</b> can mislead the registration of the anatomical image for PVC to the activity image. This, in turn, would result in wrong PVC (as in one of our simulated cases where the anatomy is mismatched relative to the activity image). Therefore, the results presented in this work have to be considered as the best-case scenario, where the attenuation map used does not hamper the registration nor the quantification and image quality.|$|R

To obtain meaningful quantitative results from PET <b>images,</b> <b>attenuation</b> correction is necessary during image reconstruction.

To address this issue, we present deep neural network methods to derive the continuous attenuation coefficients for brain PET imaging from MR images. With only Dixon MR images as the network input, the existing U-net structure was adopted and analysis using forty patient data sets shows it is superior than other Dixon based methods. When both Dixon and zero echo time (ZTE) images are available, apart from stacking multiple MR images along the U-net input channels, we have proposed a new network structure to extract the features from Dixon and ZTE images independently at early layers and combine them together at later layers. Quantitative analysis based on fourteen real patient data sets demonstrates that both network approaches can perform better than the standard methods, and the proposed network structure can further reduce the PET quantification error compared to the U-net structure with multiple inputs.
