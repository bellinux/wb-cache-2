5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) {{talks with}} Toby Flenderson (Paul Lieberstein) about his going to {{marriage}} counseling with Pam Halpert (Jenna Fischer), and Pam {{does the same}} with Nellie Bertram (Catherine Tate). Toby points out to Jim that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to tell Pam that he needs an indeterminate amount of time before Athlead pays off for the family; Pam vents to Nellie that Jim is always making unilateral decisions involving her and they each agree they are not leaving Philly for Scranton or vice versa. The Halperts leave the office looking sad and awkward together.|$|E
25|$|Sachs {{does not}} {{see the need for}} {{independent}} evaluators, and sees them as a detractor to proper progress. He argues that many facets of aid cannot be effectively quantified, and thus it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to try to put empirical benchmarks on the effectiveness of aid.|$|E

In the first case, the sample size is not large enough to allow the null hypothesis to be rejected at the 0.05 level (in fact, the p-value can never be below 0.05 for the coin example).|$|E

25|$|The Court of Appeal {{recognized}} that the approach adopted towards fair criticism has a practical implication on the evidential burden. If fair criticism goes towards liability, the burden {{would be on the}} party alleging the contempt to prove beyond reasonable doubt that the statement <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> criticism and poses a real risk of undermining public confidence in the administration of justice. Conversely, if fair criticism is a defence to an allegation of contempt, the burden would be on the alleged contemnor to show on a balance of probabilities that the statement amounts to fair criticism.|$|E
25|$|Often, bear {{viewing and}} bear hunting are {{considered}} incompatible. Even if the bear population is healthy and bear hunting is sustainable, ethical questions arise especially if hunting occurs near viewing areas and either during or {{soon after the}} viewing season. Many feel that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to encourage bears {{to be close to}} people during the summer, only to allow them to be shot in the fall. The Kodiak bear plan recognized bear hunting as a legitimate, traditional, and biologically justifiable activity. It recommended that agencies find ways to make bear hunting and bear viewing compatible on the archipelago.|$|E
25|$|Starting {{from the}} {{argument}} that a historical universal scientific method does not exist, Feyerabend argues that science does not deserve its privileged status in western society. Since scientific points of view do not arise from using a universal method which guarantees high quality conclusions, he thought {{that there is no}} justification for valuing scientific claims over claims by other ideologies like religions. Feyerabend also argued that scientific accomplishments such as the moon landings are no compelling reason to give science a special status. In his opinion, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair</b> to use scientific assumptions about which problems are worth solving in order to judge the merit of other ideologies. Additionally, success by scientists has traditionally involved non-scientific elements, such as inspiration from mythical or religious sources.|$|E

[...] BBC commentator and former Light Blue president Richard Phelps believed that Cambridge [...] "deserved" [...] the win and that [...] "it was the superior power and application of it that saw Cambridge slowly pull clear of Oxford". [...] Cambridge coach Robin Williams said [...] "It was a brave, quick decision by the umpire", while former Dark Blue and Olympic gold medallist Matthew Pinsent suggested the clash was simply a racing incident and that the race could have been allowed to continue. [...] He added: [...] "There is no yellow card offence between a warning and disqualification". [...] Oxford coach Sean Bowden blamed the defeat on the restart: [...] "We rowed with a lot of courage ... but having to restart after that great first take-off really hurt us. It just put us at a disadvantage from then on".|$|E

2500|$|Robertson, visiting London {{in early}} October, had {{discussed}} French's replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King.

[...] Moreover, none of my officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John's military ability or military views; in fact they had no confidence in him. [...] Robertson quite agreed and left me saying [...] "he knew how to act, and would report to Stamfordham" [...] ". Robertson thought (24 October) that French's [...] "mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes" [...] and that his ideas were [...] "reckless and impossible" [...] and that he had poor relations with Joffre.|$|E
2500|$|A bizarre moment {{occurred}} in round 8, whilst in a headlock, Maidana {{appeared to have}} bitten Mayweather's left hand. Mayweather explained this in the post fight, [...] "I didn't know what it was. Something happened and then my fingers were numb. After the eighth round my fingers were numb. I could only use my other hand. He bit me. I realized he bit me. We were tangled {{in the middle of}} the ring and all of a sudden I felt something on my left hand." [...] Maidana denied the bite, [...] "Maybe he thinks I'm a dog, but I never bit him. He was rubbing my eyes that round. He may have had his glove in my mouth, but I never bit him." [...] After round 9, Maidana appeared to be confused as he started walking towards the wrong corner. Mayweather immediately ran towards him to point to his corner, much to the amusement of the crowd. Maidana was unhappy with the final verdict and thought he won the fight, [...] "If the judges want to give the fight to fighters that run, they can give it to him. I was attacking all the time. Maybe I'm wrong, but I thought that I was the aggressor. I kept my plan to be aggressive but he kept holding and pushing. I don't want to waste my time with a third fight. I trained with all my heart to get this type of result. This <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>fair.</b> There's not reason for another fight." [...] For the sequel, Mayweather earned a minimum of $32 million and Maidana earned a career high $3 million.|$|E
