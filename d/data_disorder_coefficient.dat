40|$|Alkali-silica {{reaction}} (ASR) in cement is a {{major contributor}} to failure of cement structures around the world, causing increased repair costs and possible rebuild expenses. Alkali levels are indicative of the potential for ASR and are therefore measured and quantified. A linear correlation relating cement alkali concentration measured by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF) and peak ratio measured by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is developed. Regression analysis of plots correlating alkali content measured by FTIR absorption band (750 cm- 1 / 923 cm- 1) ratio versus equivalent alkali (Na 2 O) e (%Na 2 O + 0. 658 % K 2 O) quantified by XRF show linear correlation coefficient, R 2, of 0. 97. Results of this investigation are discussed in terms of microstructural <b>disorder</b> <b>coefficient</b> Cd which is a reactivity criterion for ASR-susceptible aggregates proposed by Bachiorrini [31].

40|$|In this study, the {{suitability}} of the threshold alkali level, TAL, the kinetic parameter, In k, and the microstructural <b>disorder</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Cd, of the aggregates, taken as alkali-silica reactivity criteria, was assessed using different typologies of Italian natural ASR-susceptible aggregates of known field performance. The TAL, In k, and Cd were determined using {{a modified version of}} the RILEM AAR- 3 concrete prism expansion test, the ASTM C 1260 mortar-bar expansion test, and the infrared spectroscopy test, respectively. It was found that the three reactivity criteria are all appropriate for discriminating between reactive and innocuous aggregates. However, the TAL proves to be a more suitable criterion for interpreting the field performance data of the aggregates investigated. There exists a linear relationship between TAL and In k, or between TAL and Cd, which provides a rapid means of estimating the threshold alkali levels of ASR-susceptible aggregates from the results of the ultra-accelerated mortar-bar test and/or the infrared spectroscopy test. A TAL-based classification of the degree of reactivity of the aggregates, as well as some modifications of the reactivity domains established by the infrared spectroscopy method are also proposed. 1359 - 5997 © 2004 RILEM.

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the ultra-accelerated concrete prism expansion test in alkaline solutions at 150 degrees C (testing concrete mixes at varying alkali content of concrete) was investigated in order to ascertain the reliability of this test method for evaluating the threshold alkali levels (TAL) of alkali-reactive siliceous aggregates in concrete. Five natural sands of known field performance were tested and their TAL values determined by the ultra-accelerated test were compared with those obtained from concrete prism expansion tests at 38 degrees C and 100 % RH. A correlation between the threshold alkali level of the sands and their microstructural <b>disorder</b> <b>coefficient,</b> Cd, as measured by infrared spectroscopy, was also attempted. The modified ultra-accelerated concrete prism test proved to be a rapid and reliable method for evaluating the threshold alkali level of reactive siliceous aggregates in concrete, provided that an expansion limit of 0. 11 % at 3 weeks was taken as the reactivity judgement criterion for this test. The threshold alkali level proved to be an appropriate reactivity parameter for the selection of alkali-reactive siliceous aggregates. Also, the existence of a straight-line relationship between TAL and Cd suggested the possibility of developing a new test methodology for estimating TAL, based on Cd measurements by infrared spectroscopy.

Much of the {{extensive}} work on query operators and query processing for data streams has proceeded {{without the benefit of}} an answer to this question. While such imprecision may be tolerable when dealing with simple cases, such as flat data, guaranteed physical order and element-wise operations, it can lead to ambiguities when dealing with nested <b>data,</b> <b>disordered</b> streams and windowed operators. We propose reconstitution functions to make the denotation and representation of data streams more precise, and use these functions to investigate the connection between monotonicity and nonblocking behavior of stream operators. We also touch on a reconstitution function for XML data. Other aspects of data stream semantics we consider are the use of punctuation to delineate finite subsets of a stream, adequacy of descriptions of stream disorder, and the formal specification of windowed operators. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Networked {{non-linear}} {{control systems}} (NNCS) are studied in this paper. A control {{scheme based on}} predictive control is proposed {{to address the problems}} introduced by the network. Based on the theory of the linearization of the non-linear process, a predictive control algorithm is constructed to generate a sequence of control predictions, some of which can suitably be selected to control the non-linear process and further compensate for the time delay. Methods are proposed to deal with the selection of control predictions, the control prediction sequence updating, and <b>data</b> <b>disorders</b> processing. The proposed control scheme is able to avoid the synchronization issue by modelling the predictive controller as an event-driven element. The stability of this NNCS has been studied by discussing the stability of an augmented system, the stability conditions of which can be transformed into a series of inequalities. In addition, the control method is validated by both simulations and experiments...|$|R

40|$|Background Comorbidity {{research}} in psychiatric epidemiology mostly uses measures of association like odds or risk ratios to express how strongly disorders are linked. In contrast, chronic disease epidemiologists increasingly use measures of clustering, like multimorbidity (cluster) coefficients, to study comorbidity. This article compares measures of association and clustering. Methods Narrative review, algebraical examples, a secondary analysis {{of an existing}} dataset and a pooled analysis of published data. Results Odds and risk ratios, but the former more than the latter, confound clustering with coincidental comorbidity. Multimorbidity coefficients provide a pure estimate of clustering which is {{the proportion of the}} association between disorders that is of etiological interest. Odds and risk ratios can express comorbidity between no more than two <b>disorders,</b> whilst clustering <b>coefficients,</b> although computationally laboursome, can capture multimorbidity of any number of <b>disorders.</b> Cluster <b>coefficients</b> depend less on the prevalence of illness in study groups than measures of association. Conclusion Odds and risk ratios are well suited for comorbidity research which focuses on which sets of disorders or syndromes tend to occur in combination and the implications of this for, for instance, nosological classification, a traditional interest of psychiatric epidemiology. However, the cluster coefficient is to be preferred if the interest is more aetiological, addressing for example why certain individuals are prone to multiple health problems...|$|R
