500|$|The {{large number}} of plants needing {{description}} were often listed in garden catalogues; and at this time Carl Linnaeus established the system of binomial nomenclature which greatly facilitated the listing process. Names of plants were authenticated by <b>dried</b> <b>plant</b> specimens mounted on card (a [...] or garden of dried plants) that were stored in buildings called herbaria, these taxonomic research institutions being frequently associated with the botanical gardens, many of which by then had [...] "order beds" [...] to display the classification systems being developed by botanists in the gardens' museums and herbaria. Botanical gardens had now become scientific collections, as botanists published their descriptions of the new exotic plants, and these were also recorded for posterity in detail by superb botanical illustrations. In this century, botanical gardens effectively dropped their medicinal function in favour of scientific and aesthetic priorities, and the term [...] "botanic garden" [...] came to be more {{closely associated with the}} herbarium, library (and later laboratories) housed there than with the living collectionson which little research was undertaken.|$|E
500|$|The {{expedition}} {{consisted of}} two frigates, Recherche and Espérance. The first landfall was the Canary Islands, then the Cape of Good Hope followed by Van Diemen’s Land (in Recherche Bay, Tasmania, named by d'Entrecasteaux after the flagship of his expedition [...] ), then New Caledonia, Admiralty Islands, the Dutch colony of Ambon (where Delahaye exchanged seeds with the Dutch governor) then to south-western Australia discovering and naming Esperance Bay (d'Entrecasteaux now commemorating his second ship). With water running low the ships {{then returned to the}} safety of Recherche Bay, thus completing a counterclockwise circumnavigation of the continent. The next destination was Tonga where Delahaye collected breadfruit for transport to the Isle de France (now Mauritius), then to New Caledonia (where Kermadec, captain of the Espérance died), past Vanikoro Island (unaware that this is where La Pérouse had been shipwrecked) then through the Solomons, Trobriand Islands and finally, just before the death of d’Entrecasteaux in July 1793 from scurvy, surveyed the coasts of eastern New Guinea and northern New Britain. The expedition was now under the new command of d’Auribeau the ships arriving at Sourabaya, Java, in 1793, to be told that France was now at war with European countries including Holland, Britain and Spain, also that Louis XVI had been guillotined and a French republic was now declared. The Dutch seized the ships. With one exception all the savants appeared to have revolutionary sympathies. They were interned at Semerang and the scientific collections confiscated to be eventually captured later by the British from a French ship returning them to France. Under the benign auspices of Joseph Banks, these were returned to France. Delahaye was not, like Labillardiere, interned at Semerang but was permitted to tend the breadfruit trees destined for the Isle de France. In the course of the expedition, and under the guidance of Labillardière, Delahaye had made a numbered collection of 2,699 <b>dried</b> <b>plant</b> specimens as well as many collections of seed.|$|E

[...] Located on the ground (or occasionally on a low branch), it is made of <b>dried</b> <b>plant</b> material and lined with hair, fine grasses and feathers. The female typically lays five eggs, though clutches of three tofive have been recorded. [...] The eggs, which are pale green, oval and heavily spotted with reddish-brown, measure (0.65–0.67)×(0.80–0.82)mm (0.026×0.031in). They are incubated by the female for 11–14 days. The young are altricial—born naked, blind and helpless—but fledge from the nest within 12 days. Both parents feed the young.|$|E
2500|$|Smoking is a {{practice}} {{in which a}} substance is burned and the resulting smoke breathed in to be tasted and absorbed into the bloodstream. Most commonly the substance is the dried leaves of the tobacco plant which have been rolled into a small square of rice paper to create a small, round cylinder called a [...] "cigarette". Smoking is primarily practiced as a route of administration for recreational drug use because the combustion of the <b>dried</b> <b>plant</b> leaves vaporizes and delivers active substances into the lungs where they are rapidly absorbed into the bloodstream and reach bodily tissue. In the case of cigarette smoking these substances are contained {{in a mixture of}} aerosol particles and gasses and include the pharmacologically active alkaloid [...] nicotine; the vaporization creates heated aerosol and gas to form that allows inhalation and deep penetration into the lungs where absorption into the bloodstream of the active substances occurs. In some cultures, smoking is also carried out as a part of various rituals, where participants use it to help induce trance-like states that, they believe, can lead them to spiritual enlightenment.|$|E
2500|$|There is a {{need for}} more {{widespread}} knowledge on Cucumeropsis mannii in order to re-popularize the crop and spread its many benefits. NGOs should distribute vital knowledge on crop propagation and handling, and use the crop for nutritional interventions. Importance must be placed on specific harvest timing. Early or late harvesting of Cucumeropsis mannii has a correlation with seed quality. It is important to ensure that the fruit has reached full maturity before harvest in order to secure maximum egusi-itoo yields. [...] Full maturity is signified by fully <b>dried</b> <b>plant</b> leaves. [...] Seeds of this fruit should be harvested after 65 days after anthesis. This allows for increased germination ability of stored seeds ensuring productive future yields. It is recommended that farmers select for the seeds with the highest weight for best germination results. In order to achieve the highest possible seed quality it is recommended that harvested fruits be left for 10–20 days to after-ripen. In order to combat pests such as the Dacus punctifrons fields should be rotated yearly, as the fly pupae remain in the soil. [...] Increases in egusi-itoo yield and proper storing techniques will help rural subsistence farmers increase food supplies, while allowing for profit gain.|$|E
