500|$|... "Watch n' Learn" [...] {{was written}} by Priscilla Renea, Chauncey Hollis, Rihanna and Alja Jackson. The {{production}} of the song was helmed by Hollis under his stage-name Hit-Boy. Hollis had previously worked with music artists like Lil Wayne, The Throne, Eminem and Jennifer Lopez. [...] "Watch n' Learn" [...] wasn't originally meant for any particular artist when Hit-Boy started to work on it. In an interview with Jocelyn Vena from MTV News he explained: [...] "I was at the studio with this amazing [...] Priscilla Renea, and I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to go home, but I was like, 'Stay here {{and see if you}} could come up with an idea for this '". Renea previously penned Rihanna's 2011 single [...] "California King Bed" [...] (Loud, 2010). Hollis further explained that by the time he left the studio and came home, Renea already sent him the idea and concept for the song through IChat. He was eventually satisfied with it and sent the song to Rihanna, in which her team [...] "went crazy" [...] when they heard it. [...] Rihanna then recorded the song for inclusion on her sixth studio album Talk That Talk (2011).|$|E
2500|$|The Doctor's {{relationship}} with Rose intensifies after he regenerates into the Tenth Doctor. In [...] "New Earth", Rose's body is temporarily inhabited by Cassandra, who kisses the Doctor romantically. This {{is one of}} the few scenes in the entire programme where the Doctor is kissed romantically by his companion. In [...] "School Reunion", the arrival of the Doctor's previous companion Sarah Jane Smith and his reaction to seeing her again prompts jealousy and worry from Rose, and Sarah all but admits that she has long been in love with the Doctor. The Doctor also expresses dismay at having his companions age while he regenerates. In the episode, [...] "The Girl in the Fireplace" [...] (written by Steven Moffat), the Doctor falls in love with Madame de Pompadour, with whom he shares a passionate kiss and a strong romantic connection. She even takes him away to [...] "dance", but how far the metaphor (coined in the episode [...] "The Doctor Dances") is taken is not seen on screen. Rose does not openly exhibit jealousy towards Madame de Pompadour. In the novel The Stone Rose, by Jacqueline Rayner, the Doctor kisses Rose after she saves him from being petrified, although it is described as [...] "a kiss of gratitude and joy and unspeakable pleasure at being alive." [...] In [...] "The Impossible Planet" [...] the Doctor and Rose share an awkward moment when they have to consider settling down in one time period and Rose suggests they do so together. She later plants a kiss for good luck on the Doctor's spacesuit prior to his descent into the pit. In [...] "The Satan Pit" [...] the Doctor, fearing for his life, tells someone [...] "If you see Rose, tell her... tell her... oh, she knows". In [...] "Doomsday", when the Doctor says his goodbye to Rose, she finally tells him that she loves him. He begins to reply, but the message is cut off, and he is unable to reciprocate; in the episode's audio commentary, executive producer Julie Gardner had stated that [...] "he absolutely was going to say it... he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> he loved her." ...|$|E

Cyrus Morgan {{cleared his throat and}} said, [...] "It was great, Mother, great. She took the shine off the other play-actors all right. I knew that National Gazette man didn't know what he was talking about. Mother, let us go and see Josie right off. She's stopping with her aunt at the Maberly Hotel--I saw it in the paper this morning. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> she was right and we were wrong.

60|$|St. Clare {{had called}} her to show a {{statuette}} {{that he had been}} buying for her; but her appearance, as she came on, impressed him suddenly and painfully.

Her father folded her suddenly in his arms, and almost forgot what he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

But we all had to do what we did on account of the conduct of others, and as it is settled now, I think we ought all to try to be as happy as we can, and forget our troubles. Here is Harrison, and he and I both pray from the bottom of our hearts that you will shake hands with him. I know you always liked him, for you have said so.

He then finds a magic stone in the net that the poacher used, and that's when he gets his {{memories}} from Nakatsukuni. He then meets Yuuki in Nakatasukini when he discovers that she checked out a book from the library that he was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> borrow, <b>telling</b> <b>her</b> afterwards that there is another student in his class with a magic stone.

60|$|Gerty stifled a smothered exclamation {{and gave}} a nervous cough and Edy asked what {{and she was just}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> to catch it while it was flying but she was ever ladylike in her deportment so she simply passed it off with consummate tact by saying that that was the benediction because just then the bell rang out from the steeple over the quiet {{seashore}} because Canon O'Hanlon was up on the altar with the veil that Father Conroy put round his shoulders giving the benediction with the Blessed Sacrament in his hands.|$|E

60|$|I {{say that}} my place was by her side, {{but it was not}} so dashed easy to get there, for she was setting a {{cracking}} pace.

At the next landing, however, the gruelling <b>going</b> appeared <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> on <b>her,</b> for she slackened off a trifle and showed symptoms of roaring, {{and by the time we}} were in the straight we were running practically neck and neck.

50|$|Hanabi's short fused and pushy yet sweet {{childhood}} friend. They {{were friends}} since birth and next door neighbors. He {{claimed to have}} practically raised Hanabi. He trained Hanabi to be strong. Ultimately making her who she is now. He moved to Denmark when Hanabi began elementary school because of his father's work, but promised to return when she became really strong. Ten years later, he returned to Japan to fulfill his promise. He came {{for a short period}} of time to look for houses in the area. He told Hanabi to break up with her boyfriend to be with him. He took Hanabi to a love hotel to 'make her a woman', but they didn't go in. However, they were spotted by Hanabi's schoolmates who misunderstood the situation and spread the gossip around school. Yasuaki squashed that rumor immediately by saying that Hanabi was just showing an old friend around town. Yasuaki was still jealous though, and spoke harshly to Hanabi, assuming that she and Takeru were together. She got upset and proclaimed that she chose Takeru, not wanting to hear any more of Yasuaki's mean words. Hanabi was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> Takeru <b>her</b> decision when she found that Takeru and Yasuaki got into a fight. She immediately ran to Yasuaki and realized who she really chose. Yasuaki admitted to being jealous of Takeru and mentioned that the two acted and talked in the same way. Takeru told Hanabi to meet him at the airport to answer his confession, but she called him instead and told him she chose Yasuaki. He told Hanabi that if you just try something, you may actually have fun. Takeru returned later, with no signs of backing down. He took Yasuaki and Hanabi to pick up Hanabi's father at the airport. Hanabi's father got bad first impressions of Yasuaki and said that he preferred Takeru. He even called Takeru and Hanabi 'Takebi'. It turned out that he was only testing Yasuaki and Yasuaki passed his test, giving his approval for the relationship. Hanabi finally stood up to Takeru when he offered to pick her up and take her home but she declined, spending the night with Yasuaki instead.|$|R

'Can she read writing?' says the doctor. 'Oh, yes, sir, says I; 'she can read and write beautiful for a child of her age; my husband taught her.' 'Get me paper and pen and ink directly,' says he to the landlady; who went at once and got him what he wanted. 'We must quiet her at all hazards,' says the doctor, 'or she'll excite herself into another attack of fever.

She soon found he was in love with a slave girl, La Orn, who worked alongside Yen. This was a family problem as La Orn was about to become another wife for Praya Sihayotin, but she befriended Tun. To make their dream come true, Praya Sihayotin married them and took another girl named Chan, just to take care of his wife. One night Salee lured Nu Dang out to meet a guy who was supposedly to hurt her. Yen heard what was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> happen and <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> go. But, being a brat, she slaps Yen and runs back to the house. Not saying anything because she was still shaking, Yen was accused by Salee of trying to hurt Nu Dang. Yen was to be whipped as a punishment, which Praya later regrets, while Salee smiles on. Nu Dang finally <b>tells</b> <b>her</b> father that Yen was not trying to hurt her; she was trying to stop her from meeting a guy that Salee had set up. Furious at Salee, he goes to her house and whips her until she passes out. She is later stripped from her status and forced to leave the property. Feeling bad, Nu Dang ask her mom to see Yen and to apologize to Yen. Yen was shocked to see Nu Dang at her place. Nu Dang apologizes <b>to</b> Yen.

60|$|The wretched {{husband was}} now {{suffering}} all {{the anguish of}} a just remorse, and the heartlessness of his behavior in going off upon his own pleasure the whole afternoon and leaving his wife alone in a strange hotel {{to pass the time}} as she might was no less a poignant reproach, because it seemed so inconceivable in connection with what he had always taken to be the kindness and unselfishness of his character. We all know the sensation; and I know none, on the whole, so disagreeable, so little flattering, so persistent when once it has established itself in the ill-doer's consciousness. To find out that you are not so good or generous or magnanimous as you thought is, next to having other people find it out, probably the unfriendliest discovery that can be made. But I suppose it has its uses. Colonel Kenton now saw the unhandsomeness of his leaving his wife at all, and he beheld in its true light his shabbiness in not <b>going</b> back <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> he had found his old friend and was to bring him to dinner. The Lohndiener would of course have taken him straight to his hotel, and he would have been spared this shameful exposure, which, he knew well enough, Davis would never forget, but would tell all his life with an ever-increasing garniture of fiction. He cursed his weakness in allowing himself to dawdle about those arsenals and that parade-ground, and to be so far misguided by a hardened bachelor as to admire certain yellow-haired German and black-haired Hungarian women on the promenade; when he came <b>to</b> think of <b>going</b> out in that sledge, it was with anathema maranatha. He groaned in spirit, but he owned that he was rightly punished, though it seemed hard that his wife should be punished too. And then he went on miserably to figure first her slight surprise at his being gone so long; then her vague uneasiness and her conjectures; then her dawning apprehensions and her helplessness; her probable sending to the consulate to find out what had become of him; her dismay at learning nothing of him there; her waiting and waiting in wild dismay as the moments and hours went by; her frenzied running to the door at every step and her despair when it proved not his. He had seen her suffering from less causes. And where was she? In what low, shabby tavern had he left her? He choked with rage and grief, and could hardly speak to the gentleman, a naturalized fellow-citizen of Vienna, to whom he found the consul introducing him.|$|R
