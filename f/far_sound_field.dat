40|$|A {{fast and}} {{accurate}} numerical method is presented for predicting the sound field generated by subsonic propellers. The free space field, including the near and <b>far</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> radiated by noncompact sources, is calculated {{by means of}} a retarded time integration in time domain. The FW-H equation is applied to solving the sound field generated by moving boundaries of solid body in the flow field, but its quadrupole term is neglected. Thus the noncompact sources mean the thickness source and the load source both are included in the dipole term. According to the assumption, the sound field generated by a 3 -D shaped propeller is considered as the sum of the terms radiated by each strip element located spanwise. The pressure chordwise distribution at each element should be known before solving the sound field. For this purpose a code solving 2 -D compressible full velocity potential equation with body-fitting coordinates is used which has been developed by BUAA previously. Comparison of calculated results with test data proves the present method and the code to be useful engineering tools. This conclusion has been also tested in the design of a propeller. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper the authors keep on {{developing}} the approach to a problem of the determination of sound sources and their localization in a turbulent jet. This approach was proposed in [1 - 2] and {{was based on the}} azimuthal decomposition of the <b>far</b> <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> via one 6 -microphones array around jet, moving step by step along the jet axis. The directivities of the azimuthal component radiation in the frequency band 600 - 1350 Hz is investigated by making use of this system. The method of sound source localization developed in [1 - 2] was based on the minimization of the directivity functional in the space of the functions corresponding to the noise directivities of vortex rings and moving quadruples acting in the equivalent point source locations and lip noise dipoles respectively. Following this approach we take into account the effect of the noise refraction to meet better the experimental data for small downstream angle to the jet axis. It gives the new model curves, determining the new locations of the radiating vortex rings and the small-scaled turbulence in frequency bands. The fact of better agreement in turn guarantees better reliability of the source localization and the values of relative input of each type of source. I...|$|E

40|$|A {{study is}} made of certain {{elementary}} source distributions {{on the surface of}} a rigid sphere for a fairly extensive range of frequencies. The elementary systems considered consist of a point source, uniformly vibrating caps and rings, and plane line sources. Results are given for typical cases of the <b>far</b> zone <b>sound</b> <b>fields</b> and acoustic impedances of caps and rings, and also for the <b>far</b> zone <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> of a particular plane line source. Combinations of the elementary rings and caps are examined with a view to producing desired directional patterns and the results for a particular directional beam are presented. Taking a sphere {{as a model for the}} human head, the results for a point source are used to examine possible mechanisms for the binaural localization of sources of sound. These results indicate that, due to non-linear variation of phase with frequency, a pulsed sound should appear in a somewhat different form at each ear. It is suggested that localization is achieved by the brain in reconciling such pulse forms and that time and intensity differences are elements in a much more general process. Another possible application of the results involves the particular line source considered which could be taken to represent a human mouth...|$|R

A three dimensional unsteady fluid dynamics simulation was conducted to produce aerodynamic data used as the acoustic source for an aeroacoustics simulation. Two acoustic models were developed: one modeling the forces on the rotating fan blades as a set of rotating dipoles located at the center of mass of each fan blade and one modeling the forces on the stationary fan shroud as a field of distributed stationary dipoles. Predicted acoustic response was compared to experimental data. The blade source model predicted overall <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> power levels within 7 dBA and the shroud model predicted overall <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> power levels within 14 dBA.

Euler-perturbation approaches that simulate sound generation at obstacles due to upstream injected test-vorticity allow {{to assess the}} efficiency of a geometry to transform vortical energy into acoustic energy. Acoustic analogies with sources determined either by an unsteady flow simulation or described statistically yield hybrid two-step methods that in addition {{take into account the}} turbulent source strength. An acoustic analogy is presented that uses acoustic perturbation equations (APE) for the simulation of the acoustic radiation problem in space and time. The acoustic convection and refraction effects are part of the simulation of wave propagation such that the source domain is limited to the vicinity of the sound generating geometry where the unsteady vorticity has a considerable magnitude. Using linearized acoustic perturbation equations the unbounded growth of hydrodynamic instabilities in critical mean flows is prevented completely. Computational results for trailing edge noise based on a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) of the compressible flow problem and acoustic perturbation equations for the acoustic simulation are presented.

40|$|Room Impulse Responses (RIRs) are {{typically}} measured using {{a set of}} microphones and a loudspeaker. When RIRs spanning a large volume are needed, many microphone measurements must be used to spatially sample the <b>sound</b> <b>field.</b> In {{order to reduce the}} number of microphone measurements, RIRs can be spatially interpolated. In the present study, RIR interpolation is formulated as an inverse problem. This inverse problem relies on a particular acoustic model capable of representing the measurements. Two different acoustic models are compared: the plane wave decomposition model and a novel time-domain model that consists of a collection of equivalent sources creating spherical waves. These acoustic models can both approximate any reverberant <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> created by a <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> source. In order to produce an accurate RIR interpolation, sparsity regularization is employed when solving the inverse problem. In particular, by combining different acoustic models with different sparsity promoting regularizations, spatial sparsity, spatio-spectral sparsity and spatio-temporal sparsity are compared. The inverse problem is solved using a matrix-free large scale optimization algorithm. Simulations show that the best RIR interpolation is obtained when combining the novel time-domain acoustic model with the spatio-temporal sparsity regularization, outperforming the results of the plane wave decomposition model even when far fewer microphone measurements are available...|$|R

40|$|The {{mechanism}} by which the noise generated at the blade passing frequency by a propeller is altered when the propeller axis is at an angle of attack to the freestream is examined. The measured noise field is distinctly non axially symmetric under such conditions with <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> pressure levels both diminished and increased relative to the axially symmetric values produced with the propeller at zero angle of attack. Attempts {{have been made to}} explain this non axially symmetric <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> based on the unsteady (once per rev) loading experienced by the propeller blades when the propeller axis is at non zero angle of attack. A calculation based on this notion appears to greatly underestimate the measured azimuthal asymmetry of noise for high tip speed, highly loaded propellers. A new mechanism is proposed; namely, that at angle of attack, there is a non axially symmetric modulation of the radiative efficiency of the steady loading and thickness noise which is the primary cause of the non axially symmetric <b>sound</b> <b>field</b> at angle of attack for high tip speed, heavily loaded propellers with a large number of blades.

40|$|This thesis details a {{study of}} {{strategies}} used to limit the flow generated noise encountered in the outlet diffusers of high velocity heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) duct systems. The underlying noise rating criterion is drawn from the specifications covering ocean going aluminium fast ferries. Although directed primarily towards the fast ferry industry the results presented herein are applicable to other niche high velocity HVAC applications. Experimental tests have been conducted to prove the viability of a high velocity HVAC duct system in meeting airflow requirements whilst maintaining acceptable passenger cabin noise levels. A 50 mm diameter circular jet of air was expanded using a primary conical diffuser {{with a variety of}} secondary outlet configurations. Noise measurements were taken across a velocity range of 15 to 60 m/s. An optimum outlet design has been experimentally identified by varying the diffuser angle, outlet duct length and the termination grill. A 4 to 5 fold reduction in required duct area was achieved {{with the use of a}} distribution velocity of 20 to 30 ms- 1, without exceeding the prescribed passenger cabin noise criteria. The geometric configuration of the diffuser outlet assembly was found to have a pronounced effect on the noise spectrum radiating from the duct outlet. The development of a numerical model capable of predicting the flow induced noise generated by airflow exiting a ventilation duct is also documented. The model employs a Large Eddy Simulation (LES) CFD model to calculate the turbulent flow field through the duct diffuser section and outlet. The flow-generated noise is then calculated using a far field acoustic postprocessor based on the Ffowcs-Williams and Hawkings integral based formulation of Lighthill&# 146;s acoustic analogy. Time varying flow field variables are used to calculate the fluctuating noise sources located at the duct outlet and the resulting <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> pressure levels.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{theoretical and}} experimental studies {{on a combination}} of active noise control and active vibration control for a ventilation duct. Ventilationsystems radiate noise at the duct outlets and from the duct walls. In many practical applications, ventilation ducts are installed without shielding, although, they may run through corridors and adjacent rooms or halls to be ventilated. Thus both air- and structure-borne disturbances can be a cause of acoustic discomfort for the occupants. In this study the combined active control of air- and structure-borne noise is examined. In the theoretical study a duct segment with circular cross-section has been modelled using an elemental approach with coupled acoustic impedance and structural mobility functions. This model is used to investigate the principle effects and limitations of feed forward control using acoustic sources acting on the duct interior and the effect of feedback control forces acting on the duct walls. The control performance is evaluated in terms of (a) the <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> power radiated from the duct outlet and (b) the <b>far</b> <b>field</b> <b>sound</b> power radiated from the duct walls. For the experimental studies a laboratory duct set-up is used, which is equipped with loudspeaker, shaker and an axial ventilator as primary sources and a combined active noise and active vibration control system. Results for loudspeaker and shaker primary excitations are in reasonable agreement with the simulations for ideal air and structure borne sources. Experiments with the ventilator source are used to investigate the system limitations in the presence of air flow induced turbulences and structure borne disturbances. Both the theoretical and experimental results show that the air borne noise radiated from the duct outlet can be significantly attenuated using feed-forward active noise control. In presence of structure borne noise the performance of the activenoise control is impaired and sound radiation from the duct walls is increased. In this case, if the active noise control is combined with a vibration controlsystem, the control of the sound radiation by the duct outlet is improved and considerable reductions of the sound radiation from the duct wall are achieved...|$|R
