40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} interrogate, from a feminist perspective, the {{question}} of citizenship in the transition from ethno-national conflict to peace. By focusing {{on the case of}} Bosnia-Herzegovina, this study investigates the dynamics, local and international, shaping women's citizenship in the current political context achieved with the <b>Day</b> <b>ton</b> Peace Agreement (DPA) which {{put an end to the}} Bosnian war in 1995. Drawing on the feminist scholarship which examines the gender dynamics embedded in post-conflict transformation, this thesis seeks to re-asses the promises of change encapsulated in the achievement of (relative) peace. This naturally entails bringing into sharp focus the problematic assumptions underlying the dominant definitions of citizenship in Post-Day ton Bosnia-Herzegovina. This study demonstrates that the official discourse, disguised under the cloak of ethno-national belonging, produces a notion of citizenship which is intrinsically exclusionary and gendered. Accordingly, this thesis argues that, since the post-conflict transformation has generally retained and reproduced elements of the gender order embedded in the ethno-nationalist discourses and in the consequent phase of conflict, the promises of achieving a more equitable society through the consolidation of peace have not been fulfilled. This study reveals a complex picture in which certain dynamic 9 embedded in the current political arrangements of Bosnia-Herzegovina and in the international agenda hinder collective efforts to re-imagine and re-enact citizenship outside the dominant ethno-national logic. At the same time, the research illuminates new instances and locales for women's citizenship discourses and practices. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
