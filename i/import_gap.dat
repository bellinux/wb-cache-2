5000|$|In 2014, 70% of Russia's {{crude oil}} exports, and 90% of its natural gas exports, went to Europe. According to James Henderson and Tatiana Mitrova of the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, European gas output is {{expected}} to slip from around 250bcm in 2014 to 225bcm in 2020 and 150bcm in 2030, leaving an <b>import</b> <b>gap</b> of over 310bcm {{by the end of}} this decade and over 420bcm by 2030. Much of this gap in demand could potentially be supplied by Russia. Beginning in 1968, Russia (the USSR at the time) began energy exports to Western Europe, starting with the supply of gas exports to Austria. Growth in Europe has gone from 100 billion cubic meters annually in 1970 to 570 billion cubic meters in 2005. In the words of Henderson and Mitrova, [...] "Gazprom's exports to Non-FSU (Former Soviet Union) countries rose from an initial level of 3.5bcm in 1970 to a peak of 162bcm in 2005, with sales extending across 28 countries in the region." ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} the infrastructure investment required for gas pipeline and liquefied natural gas (LNG) connections to meet growing gas demand in an enlarged EU over the next 20 years. Several issues are presented, bearing in mind the major objective of the security of supply for EU countries. First, to set the scene, recent projections of gas demand in an enlarged EU are presented along with the corresponding need for additional imports. Then a scenario is developed showing possible supply routes to meet the <b>import</b> <b>gap,</b> relying on increasingly remote routes. An impressive bill of $ 150 to 200 billion will have to be paid for extending and building the required infrastructure in pipeline links and LNG-receiving facilities. The expected major development of LNG markets is subject to a particular discussion, as far as the progressive globalisation of this market and its inherent flexibility provide major advantages in terms of the security of supply, despite more costly infrastructure than pipeline links. The impact of technological progress is expected to reduce both capital investment and unit transport costs, offering access to new supply opportunities. Finally, the question of major obstacles to the realisation of the required huge investments in gas infrastructure over the next 20 years is addressed, opening hot debate on the subjects of future gas price, market liberalisation and financing issues.

40|$|THB present {{paper will}} {{describe}} {{some aspects of}} research carried out at the Research Department of the Bank of Israel since 1958 in connection with forecasting and the programming of Israel's development. Work of this kind had already been carried out in Israel at an earlier stage 1 and present research has greatly benefited from it. I shall, however, confine myself to the more recent, though short, experience with which I feel more familiar. Being more of a survey the description will of necessity be rather sketchy and brief, but I shall try {{to refer to the}} relevant sources for additional material, in case of interest. The present phase in the field of analysis and programming of development had its origins in discussions in the Ministry of Finance and the Bank of Israel towards the end of 1957. It was felt at the time that although {{there was a great deal}} of Govern-ment intervention in many fields of economic activity (such as large-scale promotion of and participation in development projects, export promotion through subsidies and allowances, licensing of imports, and other broad fiscal and monetary measures), and although there seemed to prevail some broad agreement as to the basic aims and needs of this economy (such as the absorption into full employment of large-scale immigra-tion and the gradual closing of a considerable <b>import</b> <b>gap),</b> there had been little in the way of integration of individual sector plans and policy measures into one consistent whole. Need was felt for a long-term macro-economic forecast or plan which could be translated into annual 'National Budgets'. The latter were intended to form the background to the various Government budgets (the Regular, Development, and Foreign Currency Budgets) submitted to Parliament towards the beginning of the ' Among thc planning projects in the past the ones of widest scope were, notably, carricd our by Dr. A.

40|$|The high {{capacity}} general amino acid permease, Gap 1 p, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae is distributed between the plasma membrane and internal compartments according to availability of amino acids. When internal amino acid levels are low, Gap 1 p is localized to the plasma membrane where it imports available amino acids from the medium. When sufficient amino acids are <b>imported,</b> <b>Gap</b> 1 p at the plasma membrane is endocytosed and newly synthesized Gap 1 p is {{delivered to the}} vacuole; both sorting steps require Gap 1 p ubiquitination. Although {{it has been suggested}} that identical trans-acting factors and Gap 1 p ubiquitin acceptor sites are involved in both processes, we define unique requirements for each of the ubiquitin-mediated sorting steps involved in delivery of Gap 1 p to the vacuole upon amino acid addition. Our finding that distinct ubiquitin-mediated sorting steps employ unique trans-acting factors, ubiquitination sites on Gap 1 p, and types of ubiquitination demonstrates a previously unrecognized level of specificity in ubiquitin-mediated protein sorting...|$|R

40|$|Recently, applicational and {{technological}} {{studies have been}} performed {{by a group of}} scientists and industry, led by DLR, basing on experiences with ocean-colour sensor MOS-IRS. The result is a new low-cost mission concept with special emphasis on coastal-zone remote sensing, which will be able to fill an <b>imported</b> <b>gap</b> in Earth observation data, i. e. to detect the strongly needed data for {{a better understanding of the}} rapid changes of coastal areas and to provide a tool for monitoring catastrophical hazards. The proposed low-budget mission ECOMON (Regional Ecological Research and Monitoring) will provide visible to the thermal infrared data with relatively high spectral (1. 4 nm) and spatial resolution (100 m). The VISSWIRTIR spectral region will be covered by 16 selectable channels in the visible, four channels in the SWIR, and one in the TIR. The swath width will be 400 km and a off-nadir tilting possibility ensures a high repetition rate of two days (for latitudes > 30 °). Using mainly compact off-the-shelf technology and carrying this payload on a mini-satellite can ensure a low-budget mission with adequate performance for coastal zone observation...|$|R

40|$|The {{persistent}} {{shortfall in}} India’s production of pulses {{in the wake}} of rising demand has led to an increasing volume of imports in the last decade. By bridging the demand–supply <b>gap,</b> <b>imports</b> are aimed at restricting rising domestic prices. However, {{the extent to which the}} imports have been successful in controlling domestic prices is a question that remains unanswered. This paper tries to assess the extent and nature of the cooling effect of imports on domestic prices for one of India’s most important pulses—pigeon pea. Using high-frequency, weekly data we find that for the period 2002 – 2012, pigeon pea imports and domestic prices are cointegrated. In the long run, a 1 percent increase in imports is associated with lowering prices by approximately 3 percent.

Due to a number of factors, Bangladesh's labour-intensive agriculture has achieved steady increases in food grain production despite the often unfavorable weather conditions. These include better flood control and irrigation, a generally more efficient use of fertilizers, and the establishment of better distribution and rural credit networks. With 28.8 million metric tons produced in 2005-2006 (July-June), rice is Bangladesh's principal crop. By comparison, wheat output in 2005-2006 was 9 million metric tons.

National sales of the classes of insecticide used on rice, including granular carbofuran, synthetic pyrethroids, and malathion exceeded 13,000 tons of formulated product in 2003. The insecticides not only represent an environmental threat, but are a significant expenditure to poor rice farmers.
