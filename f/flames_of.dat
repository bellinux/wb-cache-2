5|$|Craig Michael Conroy (born September 4, 1971) is an American former {{professional}} {{ice hockey}} player {{and the current}} assistant {{general manager of the}} Calgary <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> the National Hockey League (NHL). A sixth-round selection of the Montreal Canadiens at the 1990 NHL Entry Draft, Conroy played 1,009 NHL games for the Canadiens, St. Louis Blues, Calgary Flames and Los Angeles Kings during a professional career that spanned from 1994 to 2011.

5|$|In 1912 {{he built}} two pulpits {{for the church}} of Santa Maria in Blanes: the pulpit on the Gospel side had a {{hexagonal}} base, decorated with the dove of the Holy Spirit and the names in Latin of the four evangelists and the seven Gifts of the Holy Spirit; the pulpit of the Epistle side had {{the names of the}} apostles who wrote epistles (Saint Peter, Saint Paul, Saint John the Evangelist, Saint Judas Thadeus and Saint James the Great), with the three theological virtues and the <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> Pentecost. These pulpits were burned in July 1936.|$|E
5|$|In March 1854, {{the steamer}} Black Warrior {{stopped at the}} Cuban port of Havana on a regular trading route from New York City to Mobile, Alabama. When it failed to provide a cargo manifest, Cuban {{officials}} seized the ship, its cargo, and its crew. The so-called Black Warrior Affair was viewed by Congress {{as a violation of}} American rights; a hollow ultimatum issued by Soulé to the Spanish to return the ship served only to strain relations, and he was barred from discussing Cuba's acquisition for nearly a year. While the matter was resolved peacefully, it fueled the <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> Southern expansionism.|$|E

5|$|The 98%-ish {{complete}} beta and {{an earlier}} version were eventually leaked and made playable. Soon afterward, an unofficial restoration effort known as Chrono Trigger: <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> Eternity became popular and aimed to fully complete the game's development, switching from using the earlier version as a base to the latest released version. While it received heavy criticism from the first developers and a very mixed reaction from the fan base {{for some of the}} changes, it nonetheless is the most stable version of the game and is under active development.|$|E
5|$|The American robin has a {{place in}} Native American mythology.

The Tlingit people of Northwestern North America held it to be a culture hero created by Raven to please the people with its song.

5|$|The Lady Vols {{were awarded}} the No. 1 {{seed in the}} Mideast Regional where their {{opponent}} was, oddly enough, also undefeated. The 28–0 Lady <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> Liberty were the champions of the Big South conference, giving them a berth in the tournament as a No. 16 seed. The usual #1-#16 blowout occurred, with Tennessee winning 102–58, although in another region this blowout did not occur: No. 16 seed Harvard upset injury-depleted No. 1 seed Stanford 71–67 in the West regional. This {{is the only time}} that a 16-seed has beaten a 1-seed in the NCAA tournament— men's or women's.|$|E
5|$|The {{first two}} games were in Anaheim, both won by the Ducks by one-goal margins. Game 3 went to the Senators, but Game 4 in Ottawa was won by the Ducks, for an insurmountable three games to one lead. The Ducks would finish the series in Game 5 at home. The Ducks had been favoured to win the Cup since before the season started. The Senators were the third {{consecutive}} Canadian franchise to reach the Final and they suffered the same fate as the Calgary <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> 2004 and the Edmonton Oilers of 2006.|$|E
5|$|Electricity {{is a very}} {{convenient}} way {{to transfer}} energy, {{and it has been}} adapted to a huge, and growing, number of uses. The invention of a practical incandescent light bulb in the 1870s led to lighting becoming one of the first publicly available applications of electrical power. Although electrification brought with it its own dangers, replacing the naked <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> gas lighting greatly reduced fire hazards within homes and factories. Public utilities were set up in many cities targeting the burgeoning market for electrical lighting. In the late 20th century and in modern times, the trend has started to flow in the direction of deregulation in the electrical power sector.|$|E

5|$|In the Ramayana, Sita – the consort of Rama (the {{prince of}} Ayodhya and an avatar {{of the god}} Vishnu) – is seized by Ravana and imprisoned in Lanka, until she is rescued by Rama, who slays her captor. Sita {{undergoes}} Agni Pariksha (an ordeal of fire) by which she proves her chastity before she is accepted by Rama. In some versions of the epic, the fire-god Agni creates Maya Sita, who takes Sita's place and is abducted by Ravana and suffers his captivity, while the real Sita hides in the fire. At Agni Pariksha, Maya Sita and the real Sita exchange places again. While some texts mention that Maya Sita is destroyed in the <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> Agni Pariksha, others narrate how she is blessed and reborn as the epic heroine Draupadi or the goddess Padmavati. Some scriptures also mention her previous birth being Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to molest.|$|E
5|$|Known {{as one of}} the game's {{greatest}} snipers, Hull was {{an elite}} scorer {{at all levels of the}} game. He played college hockey for the University of Minnesota-Duluth Bulldogs, where he scored 52 goals in 1985–86. He scored 50 the following year with the Moncton Golden <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> the American Hockey League (AHL) and had five consecutive NHL seasons of at least 50 goals. His 86 goals in 1990–91 is the third highest single-season total in NHL history. Hull won the Hart Memorial Trophy and Lester B. Pearson Award that year as the league's most valuable player. He was named a first team all-star on three occasions and played in eight NHL All-Star Games.|$|E
5|$|He far {{exceeded}} doctors' expectations; he was skating {{by the beginning}} of September and was back playing hockey less than four months following the accident. He played a five-game conditioning stint with the Saint John <b>Flames</b> <b>of</b> the American Hockey League in late October before being recalled by the Flames on October 28, 1999. That night, he made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators and was praised by his coach, Brian Sutter, for playing a mistake free game. He scored his first NHL goal on November 10 against the San Jose Sharks. Regehr played 57 games for the Flames in 1999–2000, scoring five goals and 12 points.

5|$|When Rama {{abandons}} {{the young}} Maya Sita at Agni Pariksha, she – {{worried about her}} uncertain future – questions Rama and Agni about what should she do now. They advise {{her to go to}} Pushkar and perform austerities (Tapas) and prophesy that she will be become Svargalakshmi ("Lakshmi of the heaven") as the result of her asceticism. Shiva is pleased with her penance and promises to grant her desired boon. Maya Sita, who is transformed into Svargalakshmi by practising austerities for three lakh years, anxiously repeats five times that she get a husband. Shiva blesses her that she will be born as Draupadi, the princess of Pancala, who will have five husbands. Draupadi, the heroine of the Mahabharata, is born out of the <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> a yajna (fire sacrifice) of Drupada (King of Panchala) and later becomes the common wife of the five Pandava brothers, princes of Kuru kingdom. The text also declares that in previous birth, Maya Sita was Vedavati, a woman Ravana tries to rape and who curses Ravana that she will be the cause of his ruin. Since she has taken birth in three yugas (ages; a cycle of four ages is believed to repeat) – Vedavati in Satya yuga, Maya Sita in Treta Yuga and Draupadi in Dwapara yuga, she is known as Trihayani, the one who appears in the three ages.|$|E
5|$|While {{economic}} policies were the original motivating {{factor in the}} growing partisan split, foreign policy also became a factor. Though most Americans supported the French Revolution prior to the Execution of Louis XVI, some of Hamilton's followers began to fear the radical egalitarianism of the revolution as it became increasingly violent. Washington particularly feared British entrance into the war, as he worried that sympathy for France and hatred for Britain would propel the United States into the French Revolutionary Wars, to the ruin of the American economy. In 1793, after Britain entered the French Revolutionary Wars, several Democratic-Republican Societies were formed. These societies, centered {{on the middle class}} of several eastern cities, opposed Hamilton's {{economic policies}} and supported France. Conservatives came to fear these societies as populist movements that sought to re-make the class order. That same year, the British began attacking American ships that were trading with France, fanning the <b>flames</b> <b>of</b> anti-British sentiment. As Washington continued to seek peace with Great Britain, critics finally began to attack the president himself.|$|E
