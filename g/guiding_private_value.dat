This paper aims {{to answer this}} question, which has been exten-sively studied in the literature, from a nonstan-dard point of view, namely, {{anticipated}} regret. William Vickrey (1961) derived risk neutral Nash equilibrium (RNNE) bidding behavior in <b>private</b> <b>value</b> first price sealed bid auctions. However, bidding higher than the RNNE (over-bidding) in first price <b>private</b> <b>value</b> auctions {{is one of the}} consistent findings of the experimen-tal literature (see the seminal papers of Jame...|$|R

30|$|The {{results from}} this study reveal that consumers’ {{perceived}} <b>private</b> <b>value</b> is more effective than their perceived social value. It has two implications. Firstly, a strategy for consumers’ <b>private</b> <b>value</b> is required. When an eco-label indicates that a product allows consumers to save money or cut costs, it will be purchased. If no <b>private</b> <b>value</b> is provided by an eco-label, the introduction of an alternative method, such as a cash-back system in which consumers can convert prior purchases to cash, could be a solution to encourage the purchase of eco-labeled products.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{introduce}} {{a class of}} games that captures many economic and social co-operation dilemmas such as bidding rings in auctions, competition for market share, labor supply decisions, queuing in line and courtship. Participants in these interactions cooperate by limiting their frequency of entry, since entry imposes a negative externality. We conduct two-player, repeated-game experiments with <b>private</b> <b>values</b> to entry where cooperation ad-mits the form of either taking turns or using a cutoff strategy and entering only for high <b>private</b> <b>values.</b> We find that in environments with disperse <b>private</b> <b>values,</b> paired subjects coordinate on the same cutoff strategies. In environments with similar <b>private</b> <b>values,</b> co-operative subjects alternate. Our results offer insight into whether a cooperative norm will arise and what form it will take: for mundane tasks or where individuals otherwise have similar payoffs, alternation is likely; for difficult tasks that differentiate individuals by skill or by preferences, cutoff cooperation will emerge...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} sequential auctions for {{objects that}} have both common and <b>private</b> <b>values.</b> Existing work has studied sequential auctions for {{objects that are}} either exclusively common or <b>private</b> <b>value.</b> However, in many cases, an object has both features. Now, in such cases, the common value (which {{is the same for}} all bidders) depends on each bidder?s valuation of the object. But, generally speaking, a bidder cannot know the true common value, since it does not know how much the other bidders value it. On the other hand, a bidder?s <b>private</b> <b>value</b> is independent of the others? <b>private</b> <b>values.</b> Given this, our objective is to study sequential auctions for heterogeneous objects that have both common and <b>private</b> <b>values</b> by treating each bidder?s information about the common value as uncertain. In so doing, we first determine equilibrium bidding strategies for each auction in a sequence. Then, since the total revenue from all the auctions in a sequence depends on the auction agenda (i. e., the order in which the objects are auctioned) we determine the optimal agenda (i. e., the one that maximizes total expected revenue across all the auctions in a sequence). Finally, we show that, for a given agenda, the total revenue is the same for first-price, second-price, and English auction rules...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, the {{structural}} analysis of auction data has attracted considerable attention. The structural approach {{relies on the}} hypothesis that observed bids are the equilibrium bids of the gametheoretic auction model under consideration. In this paper, we survey econometric methods that have been recently developed for estimating first-price auction models within the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> paradigm. In particular, we focus on two important issues. A first question is {{to know whether the}} structural elements of the model, mainly the underlying latent distribution of bidders <b>private</b> <b>values,</b> are identifiable from observations, usually the observed bids. A second issue concerns the estimation of the underlying density. This can be performed through different methods ranging from parametric to nonparametric ones. After a brief review of basic auction models, we first consider the simple first-price auction model within the symmetric independent <b>private</b> <b>value</b> paradigm with a nonbinding reserve price. In a second part, more advanced models are considered allowing for a binding reserve price, affiliation among <b>private</b> <b>values,</b> and asymmetry among bidders.

Rather, bidder behavior is better characterized by a behavioral model where the advantaged bidders simply adds their <b>private</b> <b>value</b> to their <b>private</b> information signal about the common value, and proceed to bid as if in a pure common value auction...|$|R

40|$|Sequential auctions are an {{important}} mechanism for buying/selling multiple objects. Existing work has studied sequential auctions for objects that are exclusively either common <b>value</b> or <b>private</b> <b>value.</b> However, in many real-world cases an object has both features. Also, in such cases, the common value component (which {{is the same for}} all bidders) depends on how much each bidder values the object. Moreover, an individual bidder generally does not know how much the other bidders value it. On the other hand, a bidder's <b>private</b> <b>value</b> is independent of the others' <b>private</b> <b>values.</b> Given this,we study settings that have both common and <b>private</b> <b>value</b> elements by treating each bidder's information about the common value as uncertain. We first determine equilibrium bidding strategies for each auction in a sequence using English auction rules. On the basis of this equilibrium, we analyse the effeciency of auctions. Specifically, we show that the inefficiency that arises as a result of uncertainty about the common values can be reduced if the auctioneer makes its information about the common value known to all bidders. Moreover, our analysis also shows that the inefficeincy of auctions in an agent-based setting is higher than that in an all-human setting...|$|R

The bidders' types are independent across bidders, while a bidder's <b>private</b> <b>value,</b> initial wealth and degree of risk aversion are allowed to be correlated. We show that a monotone equilibrium always exists in a general setting allowing for asymmetric bidders. Moreover, with symmetric bidders, a symmetric monotone equilibrium strategy must exist. A bidder's equilibrium strategy increases with bidders' <b>private</b> <b>values</b> and degrees of risk aversion. When bidders have CRRA utility, equilibrium bids decrease with initial wealth; when bidders have CARA utility, equilibrium bids are invariant to initial wealth...|$|R
50|$|Game-theoretic {{models of}} auctions and {{strategic}} bidding generally fall into {{either of the}} following two categories. In a <b>private</b> <b>value</b> model, each participant (bidder) assumes {{that each of the}} competing bidders obtains a random <b>private</b> <b>value</b> from a probability distribution. In a common value model, the participants have equal valuations of the item, but they do not have perfectly accurate information about this valuation. In lieu of knowing the exact valuation of the item, each participant can assume that any other participant obtains a random signal, which can be used to estimate the true valuation, from a probability distribution common to all bidders. Usually, but not always, a <b>private</b> <b>values</b> model assumes that the values are independent across bidders, whereas a common value model usually assumes that the values are independent up to the common parameters of the probability distribution.|$|R

40|$|It is a {{commonly}} accepted fact that innovation {{is important for}} economic growth and that a well-designed patent system increases research and development investments. Patents are unfortunately a second best solution. While {{the benefits of the}} patent system are increased incentives to innovation, diffusion of new knowledge, and easier commercialization of patented innovations; the drawback of the patent system is the monopolies it creates. Therefore, the fundamental question that has interested researchers is: do the benefits of the patent system outweigh the costs? This thesis contributes to the literature that quantifies the benefits of the patent protection to the assignee after the patent is granted, ie the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> of patents. In three of the four essays here, I estimate how different patent and assignee characteristics affect the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> of Finnish patents. The <b>private</b> <b>value</b> distribution of patents is calculated using patent renewal rates and fees and advanced econometric techniques. In the fourth essay I test how a legal change in the statutory length of patents has changed the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> of patents in Finland. To do this, I use nonparametric techniques. The last essay contributes to the discussion on optimal patent design. I present two overall policy recommendations based on the essay findings. First, I find that the distribution of the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> of patents depends not only on patent characteristics but also on patent assignee characteristics. This derives {{from the fact that it}} takes time and money to learn the <b>private</b> <b>value</b> of a patent. Also, there seem to be financial imperfections that, especially for smaller firms, restrict the internalization of patent revenues. If patents are seen as a good incentive mechanism for innovation, the policy implication is that commercialisation of patented innovations should be supported. Second, I find, using the patent law change as a natural experiment, that the statutory patent length of 20 years is too long. The optimal patent length is shorter than 18 years in Finland. patent; private value; renewal rates; renewal fees; Finland...|$|R
