Some years earlier, Harding <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> front porch remodeled to {{resemble}} McKinley's, which his neighbors felt signified presidential ambitions. The candidate remained at home in Marion and gave addresses to visiting delegations. In the meantime, Cox and Roosevelt stumped the nation, giving hundreds of speeches.

5|$|The {{launch of}} Doe's coup meant that Major William Jarbo, another soldier with {{political}} ambitions who {{was said to}} have excellent connections to U.S. security officials, <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> takeover plans forestalled. He tried to escape abroad but was hunted down and killed by the new government. The junta started to split in 1983, with Doe telling Quiwonkpa that he was planning to move Quiwonkpa from command of the army to a position as secretary-general of the People's Redemption Council. Unhappy with this proposed change, Quiwonkpa fled into exile in late 1983, along with his aide-de-camp Prince Johnson.|$|E
5|$|As well {{as being}} ill, he was imprisoned—after {{struggling}} with debts and haunted {{by the threat of}} ruin and imprisonment all his life—"for a wretched debt of 150 Rdr". The rumour was that a former Customs colleague, E. G. Nobelius, <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> advances to Louise Bellman rejected, and in revenge had sued Bellman for the debt, knowing he was penniless: he owed a total of almost 4,000 Riksdaler. On 11February 1795, he died in his sleep in his house in Gamla Kungsholmsbrogatan. He was buried in Klara churchyard with no gravestone, its location now unknown. The Swedish Academy belatedly placed a memorial in the churchyard in 1851, complete with a bronze medallion by Johan Tobias Sergel.|$|E

5|$|Pellew too {{was on his}} {{way back}} to Brest in Indefatigable, {{accompanied}} by Amazon under the command of Captain Robert Carthew Reynolds. While the rest of the Channel Fleet had been pursuing the French without success, Pellew <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> ships refitted and resupplied at Falmouth so that both frigates were at full complement, well armed and prepared for action. At 13:00 on 13January, the British ships were approaching the island of Ushant in a heavy fog when they spied another ship through the gloom ahead. This ship, clearly much larger than either of the British vessels, was the Droits de l'Homme. At the same time, lookouts on the French ship spotted the British, and Lacrosse was faced with the dilemma of whether or not to engage the enemy. He knew that his ship was far larger than either of his opponents, but had earlier spotted sails to westwards he believed to be British and thus considered himself outnumbered and possibly surrounded. British records show that no other British vessels were in the vicinity at the time and it is likely that Lacrosse had seen the French ships Révolution and Fraternité returning to Brest from Bantry Bay. In addition, Lacrosse was concerned by the increasing gale and rocky lee shoreline, which posed a considerable threat to his over-laden vessel, which was already damaged from its winter voyage and carried a demi-brigade of the French Army and Humbert, neither of which could be placed at risk in an inconsequential naval action.|$|E
5|$|The {{main event}} was a singles match in which WWF Champion Stone Cold Steve Austin defended against the Undertaker. Originally, Shane and Vince McMahon were {{supposed}} to be the guest referees, but due to storyline purposes, Pat Patterson, an accomplice of Vince McMahon, replaced Vince, who <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> ankle broken earlier in the event, in order to prevent Shane from helping The Undertaker. Patterson, however, was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker executed a chokeslam on him. The Undertaker and Austin wrestled inconclusively until Austin hit The Undertaker on the head with a folding chair. As Austin went to cover the Undertaker, Gerald Brisco, another accomplice of Vince, came down to the ring to replace Patterson and officiated the unsuccessful pinfall attempt by Austin. Like his partner Patterson, Brisco was unable to officiate the entire match after the Undertaker attacked him. Vince then came down to the ring as another referee replacement, but when Austin forcefully pulled the Undertaker's head over his shoulders to perform a stunner, Shane prevented him from performing a three count. As Vince and Shane argued, Austin got up and confronted Vince, at which point Shane shoved Vince into Austin, who fell into a roll-up by The Undertaker, and then performed a fast count to give him the victory and the WWF Title.|$|E
5|$|LeMond {{had planned}} to defend his title in the 1987 Tour de France with La Vie Claire, but {{he was unable to}} participate. Earlier that year, while riding in the Tirreno–Adriatico spring tune-up race, LeMond fell and {{fractured}} his left wrist. He returned to the United States to recover from the injury. The week before returning to Europe, he went turkey hunting on a ranch co-owned by his father in Lincoln, California – in the Sacramento Valley of Northern California. LeMond was with Rodney Barber and Patrick Blades, his uncle and brother-in-law. The trio had become separated when Blades, who heard movement behind him, turned and fired through a bush. The movement had come from LeMond, who was hit in his back and right side with a devastating blast of approximately 60 No. 2-sized pellets. LeMond's injuries were life-threatening, but fortunately, a police helicopter was already airborne near the scene and transported LeMond on a 15-minute air medical flight to the Medical Center at University of California-Davis. LeMond was taken for emergency surgery. He had suffered a pneumothorax to his right lung and extensive bleeding, having lost some 65 percent of his blood volume. A physician informed LeMond later that he had been within 20 minutes of bleeding to death. The operation saved his life, but four months later he developed a small bowel obstruction due to adhesions that had formed following the shooting. He underwent another surgery to relieve the obstruction and take down the adhesions. Concerned that his team would drop him if they knew the shooting accident required a second surgery, LeMond asked the surgeons to remove his appendix at the same time. He then informed his team that he <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> appendix removed, {{but the rest of the}} story was left somewhat vague. The events effectively ended his 1987 season, and in October he announced he would return to serious competition the following February, with the Dutch PDM team.|$|E

25|$|Australia had {{not played}} a Test series since their tour of England in 1961, 1961-62 being a purely {{domestic}} season.

The youthful Graham McKenzie had played in the decisive Second, Third and Fourth Tests in 1961 before being replaced by Ron Gaunt in the Fifth Test, still only 21 the big fast bowler {{was back in the}} team for Brisbane.

At the end of 1602 the Spanish force was dispatched from the Philippines, taking with them the ship Santa Potenciana and three large frigates, with 150 well-armed Spanish soldiers, 10,000 fanégas of rice, 1,500 earthen jars of palm wine, 200 head of salt beef, 20 hogsheads of sardines, conserves and medicines, 50 quintals of powder, cannonballs and bullets, and cordage and other supplies, the whole in charge of Captain Joan Xuarez Gallinato, with orders to take that help to Terrenate and to place himself under the command of the Portuguese general. He made his voyage there in a fortnight, and anchored in the port of Talangame, in the island of Terrenate, two leguas from the fort. There he found Andrea Furtado de Mendoça with his galleons at anchor, awaiting him.|$|E
25|$|The Nationalist Chinese had {{suffered}} 70 killed in action. Abandoning their dead, 24 machine guns, and their dead mules, they also fled the bombing, headed north up the Lao {{bank of the}} Mekong towards Burma because they lacked boats for a river crossing. Ten kilometers upon their way, they were blocked by the RLA infantry troops. A fortnight's impasse ensued, during which additional Lao troops flown in from Vientiane helped encircle the outnumbered KMT. The dispute was settled when Ouane {{struck a deal with}} the leaders of the caravan. According to one account, he would pay them only the customary transportation fees for the opium. Another version says that the Chinese paid $7,500 to Rattikone as a departure fee. Either way, essentially the Lao general gained an enormous amount of free opium when his paratroopers gathered it from the battlefield and shipped it to Ban Houei Sai. Ouane <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> sawmill bombarded, and his heroin refinery had burnt down during the fighting. However, he reputedly still had five more refineries working nearby. Ouane's damages were far outweighed by his gains.|$|E
25|$|The 1958-59 Ashes {{series was}} {{the end of an era}} in English cricket; after losing 4–0 in Australia Trevor Bailey, Godfrey Evans, Frank Tyson and Barrington's Surrey {{teammates}} Jim Laker and Peter Loader all retired from Test cricket. The team needed to be rebuilt and a solid batsman was needed to shore up the top order. Peter May took leave to get married and Arthur McIntyre took over as wicketkeeper-captain of Surrey. An earlier attempt to turn Barrington into an opener had failed, but McIntyre promoted him to number 3 in the order to stop him getting nervous while pacing around the dressing room waiting to bat. He made 97 against Cambridge University soon followed by 186 and 118 not out against Warwickshire at Edgbaston; 85 and 59 not out against the Indians at the Oval and 113 not out against Nottinghamshire at Trent Bridge. This earned him a recall to the England cricket team against a weak Indian side, perfect for playing a batsman into a Test career. In the First Test at Trent Bridge he joined his Surrey and England captain Peter May at 63/3 and was told not to worry about scoring as long as he fought it out. Barrington took 20 minutes to get off the mark, but hit two sixes off Chandu Borde to bring up his 50 and was out for 56 in a stand of 175 as England won by an innings. In the Second Test at Lord's England were 100/7 when Barrington top-scored with 80, adding 126 for the last three wickets to set up another big win. The Third Test at Headingley saw him making 80 again, this time adding 193 runs with Colin Cowdrey in an 8 wicket victory. The Fourth Test at Old Trafford gave him 87 as his missed out on another century, but captain Colin Cowdrey gave him the ball and he took 3/36 with his leg-spin. In the second innings he was told to go for quick runs and hit 46 in 36 minutes with 6 fours and a six, then wrapped things up with 2/75 and a catch as England won by 171 runs. Back home at the Oval for the Fifth Test Barrington was out for 8, but England completed the 5–0 whitewash with an innings victory. Barrington made 357 runs (59.50) in the series – more than anybody else – and <b>had</b> <b>had</b> <b>his</b> most prolific summer with 2,499 first-class runs (54.32), but Surrey failed to win the County Championship for the first time in 8 years, coming third. His consistent run-making won him the honour of being named one of the five Wisden Cricketers of the Year and he was an automatic choice for the forthcoming tour of the West Indies in 1959–60.|$|E
