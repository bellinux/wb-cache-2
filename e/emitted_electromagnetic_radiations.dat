50|$|Classical nonradiation {{conditions}} {{define the}} conditions according to classical electromagnetism under which a distribution of accelerating charges will not <b>emit</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation.</b> According to the Larmor formula in classical electromagnetism, {{a single point}} charge under acceleration will <b>emit</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation,</b> i.e. light. In some classical electron models a distribution of charges can however be accelerated so that no radiation is emitted. The modern derivation of these nonradiation conditions by Hermann A.

2500|$|In 1860 Gustav Kirchhoff {{proposed}} {{the idea of}} a black body, a material that <b>emits</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> at all wavelengths.

50|$|G. Askaryan {{also showed}} that cosmic ray showers <b>emit</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation,</b> thus giving yet another way for their detection. Before him it was {{commonly}} assumed that electron-photon showers do not <b>emit</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> since the electrons and positrons are created in pairs. Askaryan’s analysis led {{to the conclusion that}} in an electron-photon shower there is an excess of negative charge (excess of electrons). These excess electrons are knocked out from atoms either by photoeffect or by shower electrons and positrons (ionization). At the same time, due to the annihilation process the number of positrons decreases. Thus, there is an electric current created by the excess electrons associated with shower. This variable current is the source of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation.</b> Therefore, every shower is the source of <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation.</b> These studies opened new perspectives for distant registration of cosmic ray showers.|$|R

5|$|In 1913 the {{physicist}} Niels Bohr proposed {{a model in}} which the electrons of an atom were assumed to orbit the nucleus but could only {{do so in a}} finite set of orbits, and could jump between these orbits only in discrete changes of energy corresponding to absorption or radiation of a photon. This quantization was used to explain why the electrons orbits are stable (given that normally, charges in acceleration, including circular motion, lose kinetic energy which is <b>emitted</b> as <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation,</b> see synchrotron radiation) and why elements absorb and <b>emit</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation</b> in discrete spectra.|$|R

50|$|The {{electronics}} industry, {{particularly in}} portable and mobile devices, continually strives to lower {{supply voltage to}} save power and reduce <b>emitted</b> <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>radiation.</b> A low supply voltage, however, reduces noise immunity. Differential signaling helps to reduce these problems because, for a given supply voltage, it provides twice the noise immunity of a single-ended system.|$|R
