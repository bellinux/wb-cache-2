5|$|All slow loris species {{produce a}} toxin in glands on {{the insides of}} their elbows. This is spread across their bodies and those of their {{offspring}} using the toothcomb while grooming. When threatened with predators, the Sunda slow loris can bite, roll into a ball exposing its toxic saliva-covered fur, or roll up and drop <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> However, the primary method of predator avoidance is crypsis, whereby it hides. The Asiatic reticulated python, the changeable hawk-eagle and the Bornean orangutan have been recorded as predators of the Sunda slow loris.|$|E
5|$|Buckets {{began to}} be {{replaced}} with plastic bags, which allowed people to see at a distance how much sap had been collected. Syrup producers also began using tractors to haul vats of sap <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> being tapped (the sugarbush) to the evaporator. Some producers adopted motor-powered tappers and metal tubing systems to convey sap from the tree to a central collection container, but these techniques were not widely used. Heating methods also diversified: modern producers use wood, oil, natural gas, propane, or steam to evaporate sap. Modern filtration methods were perfected to prevent contamination of the syrup.|$|E
5|$|In 1871, Darwin {{published}} The Descent of Man, and Selection in Relation to Sex, {{which contained}} {{his views on}} human evolution. Darwin argued that {{the differences between the}} human mind and the minds of the higher animals were a matter of degree rather than of kind. For example, he viewed morality as a natural outgrowth of instincts that were beneficial to animals living in social groups. He argued that all the differences between humans and apes were explained by a combination of the selective pressures that came from our ancestors moving <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> to the plains, and sexual selection. The debate over human origins, and over the degree of human uniqueness continued well into the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|In 1946 the Mosquito Creek Sportsmen's Association {{was founded}} to promote {{conservation}} in the region. One of the association's initial concerns was the acidification of streams, which they originally attributed to tannic acid <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> {{used by the}} beavers to construct their dams. With the assistance of Pennsylvania's Department of Forests and Waters, Game Commission, and Fish and Boat Commission, they dynamited 79 dams. Afterward, they discovered the water was acidic upstream of the dams too, and eventually realized that the problem was caused by acid rain, not the beavers. The association has operated several stations to reduce the acidity of Mosquito Creek and its tributaries, with technical assistance from the Pennsylvania State University (Penn State).|$|E
5|$|Such {{behavior}} has been witnessed, {{as well as}} documented from stomach contents, with the American alligators eating such fruit as wild grapes, elderberries, and citrus fruits directly <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> The discovery of this unexpected part of the American alligator diet further reveals that American alligators {{may be responsible for}} spreading seeds from the fruit it digests across its habitat.

5|$|With the {{darkness}} and fog, Mexican soldiers could not estimate how many men had surrounded them. They withdrew 300 yards (meters) to a nearby bluff. At about 6am, Texians emerged <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees</b> and began firing at the Mexican soldiers. Lieutenant Gregorio Pérez counterattacked with 40 mounted soldiers. The Texians fell back to the trees and fired a volley, injuring a Mexican private. According to some accounts, the cannon {{fell out of the}} wagon upon the shot. Unable to safely maneuver among the trees, the Mexican horsemen returned to the bluff.|$|E
5|$|After Chataan {{affected}} Chuuk state, the island's {{residents were}} {{in need of}} food, clothes and medicine. Only a few crops were not destroyed by the storm; much of the breadfruit was stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and fruit not destroyed by the storm were damaged by parasites. In {{the days after the}} storm, the local Red Cross deployed about 100volunteers to search for victims buried by landslides. However, rescue operations were hampered by persistent flooding after the storm. Initially the death toll was unknown, and it was feared that hundreds of people had been killed. Six people who were seriously injured on Chuuk were flown to The Queen's Medical Center in Hawaii for treatment; they were initially scheduled to fly to Guam Memorial Hospital, but the facility was full. About 2,000residents affected by the storm evacuated to government-run shelters. The Red Cross shipped various relief supplies, including raincoats and water, to the affected areas. By July4, power systems were restored and the airport reopened. Although there was enough food in the immediate aftermath, the destruction of crops and cattle posed a long-term food shortage.|$|E
5|$|Although it is {{difficult}} to convince his fellow Hominidae to follow him, Pitar manages to persuade the patriarchal leader of the clan, Costello, who has taken command from the recently deceased Thorn. The band builds windbreaks to help them descend more often <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> thus exposing them to a higher risk of being attacked by predators on the ground. A rivalry emerges between Costello and another band member, Re, who not only questions the leading abilities of the present alpha but also desires Costello's females. To alleviate the escalating debate of authority, Pitar tries to implement a parliament to settle disputes peacefully. Costello, however, considers the parliament to be a forum in which he can consolidate his power, citing famous speeches by Winston Churchill and Abraham Lincoln; the other members ruin this noble idea with their lack of discipline and ostentatious indifference.|$|E

5|$|As Viet Cong fire {{increased}} in intensity, {{the soldiers of}} Delta Company picked up the distinctive sound of a U.S.-made M-60 machine-gun firing from the southern flank. Allen assumed that Alpha Company was approaching his perimeter, so he ordered them to cease-fire because he feared his rifle companies were firing on each other. However, the order was also passed down along the formation of Delta Company, which enabled the Viet Cong soldiers of the 271st Regiment to gain fire superiority. At around 11:35am, Triet unleashed his 2nd Battalion which was placed in reserve during the battle, and they attacked Welch's Delta Company from three different directions. During that time Allen tried to request artillery support, but that had become impossible due to the close proximity between U.S. and Viet Cong soldiers. In a scene that had characterized the destruction of Alpha Company earlier, both Allen and Welch were wounded in battle as Viet Cong snipers fired down <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees.</b> Nonetheless, just before 12:00pm, Allen instructed Delta Company to begin a northward march toward the battalion's base, and Bravo Company to move forward to cover the withdrawal.|$|E
5|$|With A Company {{providing}} fire support, B Company assaulted {{the position}} at 15:35 with artillery, air strikes and armour in support. From the outset the lead elements came under constant Viet Cong sniper fire <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>trees,</b> and from machine-guns {{that had not}} previously been detected by the Australians. The assault soon faltered with steadily increasing casualties as the Viet Cong resisted strongly, withstanding multiple frontal assaults, including bayonet charges by two separate platoons. Surrounded and receiving fire from all sides, the lead Australian elements from B Company could advance no further against a determined and well dug-in force, and all attempts to regain momentum were unable to dislodge the defenders. Initially the Australians had used their APCs to secure the landing zone at the jungle's edge, however with the infantry in trouble they were subsequently dispatched as a relief force. Fighting their way forward, the M113s finally arrived by 18:15 and began loading the most badly wounded as darkness approached. The Viet Cong subsequently launched two successive counter-attacks, yet both were repulsed by the Australians. During the fighting one of the APCs was subsequently disabled by a recoilless rifle at close range, killing the driver.|$|E
