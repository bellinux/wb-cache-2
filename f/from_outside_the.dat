5|$|G. Joe Kinnear was the club's first manager <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> United Kingdom {{to manage}} the club in a match—Terry Mancini, another Irishman, had a spell as the club's {{caretaker}} manager (3–11 January 1990) but did not manage the club in a match.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} twentieth century, many {{scholars}} believed that Hammurabi was Amraphel, the King of Shinar in the Book of Genesis 14:1. This view has now been largely rejected, and Amraphael's existence is not attested in any writings <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Bible.|$|E

5|$|Jacob made {{no effort}} to solicit members for his commune other than through his {{newspapers}} and sometimes rejected applicants when he felt they were not fit candidates. The commune attracted only about a dozen residents – mostly <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> Ohio area.|$|E

5|$|The first {{winners of}} the tournament were Aston Villa. The final was contested over two legs {{for the first six}} years of the competition. During this period many First Division clubs refused to take part, {{allowing}} clubs <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> First Division to regularly reach the final. The first club <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> First Division to win the competition was Norwich City of the Second Division in 1962. Queen's Park Rangers and Swindon Town, both then of Division Three, matched this feat in 1967 and 1969 respectively. Sheffield Wednesday, then in the Second Division, became the last club to win the competition while competing outside the First Division, when they beat Manchester United in the 1991 final.|$|E

5|$|A {{good example}} of {{convergence}} in plants is the evolution of edible fruits such as apples. These pomes incorporate (five) carpels and their accessory tissues forming the apple's core, surrounded by structures <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> botanical fruit, the receptacle or hypanthium. Other edible fruits include other plant tissues; for example, the fleshy part of a tomato is {{the walls of the}} pericarp. This implies convergent evolution under selective pressure, in this case the competition for seed dispersal by animals through consumption of fleshy fruits.|$|E
5|$|A six-per-side {{version of}} the sport is also played in New Zealand. Two Centres per team can play in the whole court except the {{shooting}} circles; the remaining attacking and defending players are each restricted to {{one half of the}} court, including the shooting circles. The attacking and Centre players may shoot <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> shooting circle for a two-point goal.|$|E
40|$|In the {{aftermath}} of recent years unusually large influx of immigrants to Sweden <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> European Union, the debate regarding the impact of immigration {{on the economy and}} the labor market has intensified. Some politicians and debaters raise concerns about the fiscal impacts of immigration, while others argue that immigration cause wage and employment drops for native workers. The goal {{of this study is to}} determine the impact of immigration <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> European Union on municipal wages and unemployment rate. The study has been conducted by regressing the percentage of immigrants <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> European Union on average yearly municipal income and municipal unemployment rate in order to evaluate the impact of migration <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> European Union on the two dependent variables. This study shows that immigration <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> of <b>the</b> European Union has a significant negative effect on average yearly municipal income and a non-instantaneous positive effect on the municipal unemployment rate for total, male and female population. A surprising negative effect on youth unemployment rate can also be observed...|$|R

No rules existed at the time regarding team size, but official games between clubs were typically played with nine men per club. The proposal was defeated by a 13–11 vote, {{in favor of a}} rule forbidding non-club members to play if there were 14 players (seven per team).|$|E

He wrote that if his workers could only get adequate police protection, they could resume normal operations.|$|E

Additionally, Washington nominated Robert H. Harrison, who declined to serve, and nominated William Cushing for elevation to Chief Justice, who likewise declined.|$|E

5|$|Beginning {{around the}} mid-20th century, Texas began to {{transform}} from a rural and agricultural state {{to one that}} was urban and industrialized. The state's population grew quickly during this period, with large levels of migration <b>from</b> <b>outside</b> <b>the</b> state. As {{a part of the}} Sun Belt Texas experienced strong economic growth, particularly during the 1970s and early 1980s. Texas's economy diversified, lessening its reliance on the petroleum industry. By 1990, Hispanics overtook blacks to become the largest minority group in the state.|$|E
