5|$|Charles, Prince Elector and Duke of Bavaria, {{claimed the}} German territories of the Habsburg dynasty as a {{son-in-law}} of Joseph I, and furthermore presented himself as Charles VI's legitimate imperial successor. If women {{were going to}} inherit, he claimed, then his <b>family</b> <b>should</b> have precedence: his wife, Maria Amalia, {{was the daughter of}} Joseph I. Both Charles VI and his predecessor Joseph I had died without sons. Charles of Bavaria suggested that the legitimate succession pass to Joseph's female children, rather than to the daughters of the younger brother, Charles VI. For different reasons, Prussia, France, Spain and the Polish-Saxon monarchy supported Charles of Bavaria's claim to the Habsburg territory and the Imperial title and reneged on the Pragmatic Sanction.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the family}} have all {{begun to take}} extra jobs to pay for Chris's tuition; Peter sells butt scratchers at the ballpark, Lois and Meg begin working as prostitutes, and Stewie decides to follow {{overweight}} park-goers, while playing the tuba, making them fall. As this is happening, Chris starts to feel uncomfortable with his membership at the Skull and Bones, especially after one of their activities involves teasing an orphan they had pretended to adopt. Feeling his <b>family</b> <b>should</b> not go through so much trouble to keep him satisfied, Chris asks Carter {{to help him get}} back into his old school. Carter complies with his request, and Chris moves back home, and returns to James Woods High School. At the end of the episode, Stewie plays the tuba for Chris, making him fall.|$|E
5|$|The Queen's grief was overwhelming, and the tepid {{feelings}} {{the public}} had felt previously for Albert were replaced by sympathy. Victoria wore black mourning {{for the rest of}} her long life, and Albert's rooms in all his houses were kept as they had been, even with hot water brought in the morning, and linen and towels changed daily. Such practices were not uncommon in the houses of the very rich. Victoria withdrew from public life and her seclusion eroded some of Albert's work in attempting to re-model the monarchy as a national institution setting a moral, if not political, example. Albert is credited with introducing the principle that the British royal <b>family</b> <b>should</b> remain above politics. Before his marriage to Victoria, she supported the Whigs; for example, early in her reign Victoria managed to thwart the formation of a Tory government by Sir Robert Peel by refusing to accept substitutions which Peel wanted to make among her ladies-in-waiting.|$|E

5|$|The first crusader army {{organized}} by the Holy See reached the borders of Hungary in September 1096. It was led by Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Godfrey sent a knight who had already been known to Coloman to start negotiations about the crusaders' entry into Hungary. Eight days later, Coloman agreed to meet with Godfrey in Sopron. The king allowed the crusaders to march through his kingdom but stipulated that Godfrey's younger brother Baldwin and his <b>family</b> <b>should</b> stay with him as hostages. The crusaders passed through Hungary peacefully along the right bank of the Danube; Coloman and his army followed them on the left bank. He only released his hostages after all the crusaders had crossed the river Sava, which marked the kingdom's southern frontier. The uneventful march of the main crusader army across Hungary established Coloman's good reputation throughout Europe.|$|E

25|$|Outrageous Fortune is a New Zealand family comedy crime drama {{television}} series, {{which ran}} from 12 July 2005 to 9 November 2010 on TV3.

25|$|A poll by Ipsos-Reid, also in June 2010, {{found that}} the {{majority}} two-in-three Canadians agree the royal <b>family</b> <b>should</b> not have any formal role in Canadian society, and reported growing sentiment that Elizabeth II should be Canada's last monarch. The majority 58% of Canadians want Canada to end ties to monarchy when Queen Elizabeth II's reign ends, and the majority 62% of Canadians believe that Canada's head of state should be the Governor General, not the Queen.|$|E

25|$|Haile Selassie made {{a solitary}} {{pilgrimage to the}} churches at Lalibela, at {{considerable}} risk of capture, before returning to his capital. After a stormy session {{of the council of}} state, it was agreed that because Addis Ababa could not be defended, the government would relocate to the southern town of Gore, and that in the interest of preserving the Imperial house, the emperor's wife Menen Asfaw {{and the rest of the}} imperial <b>family</b> <b>should</b> immediately depart for French Somaliland, and from there continue on to Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|As {{the male}} {{children}} of a Bali Aga couple marry and form their own households, new houses are added at the downhill end of the row. When older generations die, the houses they lived at the uphill end become vacant and are inherited by younger couples, rather like a game of musical chairs. If there are no heirs, the house are returned to the village. This ideal pattern of succession is not always adhered to but {{it is expected that}} the most senior member of the extended <b>family</b> <b>should</b> dwell in the house at the uphill end.|$|E

25|$|Contrary to the {{tradition}} that {{the children of the}} imperial <b>family</b> <b>should</b> be separated from their parents and placed with private tutors, Crown Prince Akihito and his wife Crown Princess Michiko again broke precedent from the start by preferring to raise their children instead of entrusting them to the care of court chamberlains; the Crown Princess even breastfed. She and her husband have also built up a strong position among the general public, by their frequent trips in the 47 prefectures in the country to meet people but also for the liberties taken by the imperial couple vis-a-vis the protocol. At a more formal level, the Crown Prince and Princess visited 37 foreign countries between 1959 and 1989.|$|E
25|$|The temple {{occupied}} {{what was}} doubtlessly {{one of the}} last free spaces {{in the vicinity of the}} forum. The temple’s benefactor preferred this site in the city centre to those that she owned in the outskirts: the site of the circus or the site where the Temple of Celeste was later built. Gabinia’s family, one of the richest in Dougga, was well placed within Carthage’s notables and maintained its power at Dougga, even during the reduction of the local aristocracy in the 3rd century. The terms of Gabinia’s will provide evidence of her concern that the <b>family</b> <b>should</b> endure - the annual banquet would keep alive the memory of the family’s generosity and emphasise its sociability, while the circus would provide for the pleasure of the most humble of the city’s inhabitants.|$|E
25|$|The Steele sisters come to London {{as guests}} of Mrs Jennings {{and after a}} brief {{acquaintance}} {{they are asked to}} stay at John and Fanny Dashwood's London house. Lucy sees the invitation as a personal compliment, rather than what it is, a slight to Elinor and Marianne who, being <b>family,</b> <b>should</b> have received such invitation first. Too talkative, Anne Steele betrays Lucy's secret. As a result, the Misses Steele are turned out of the house, and Edward is ordered to break off the engagement on pain of disinheritance. Edward refuses to comply and is immediately disinherited in favour of his brother, gaining respect for his conduct, and sympathy from Elinor and Marianne. Colonel Brandon shows his admiration by offering Edward the living of Delaford parsonage, so that he can marry Lucy as soon as he is ordained.|$|E

25|$|The clique complex X(G) of an {{undirected graph}} G is an {{abstract}} simplicial complex (that is, {{a family of}} finite sets closed under the operation of taking subsets), formed by the sets of vertices in the cliques of G. Any subset of a clique is itself a clique, so this family of sets meets the requirement of an abstract simplicial complex that every subset of a set in the <b>family</b> <b>should</b> also be in the family. The clique complex can also {{be viewed as a}} topological space in which each clique of k vertices is represented by a simplex of dimension k1. The 1-skeleton of X(G) (also known as the underlying graph of the complex) is an undirected graph with a vertex for every 1-element set in the family and an edge for every 2-element set in the family; it is isomorphic toG.|$|E
25|$|Under {{threat of}} the Red advance, {{the small group of}} Romanovs and their entourage were forced to flee two days later, in {{constant}} fear for their lives. The white General Viktor Pokrovsky advised them to move to Anapa, a coastal city on the Black Sea. Pokrovsky arranged a train and an escort of his own men and they left Pyatigorsk on 19 October, with their own companions and other local refugees. At Touapse, a trawler was waiting. They docked at Anapa on 4 November 1918. From there it was easy to escape abroad by boat. However, Grand Duchess Maria Pavlovna was determined to remain in Russia hoping that the White movement would prevail and Andrei's brother, Grand Duke Kirill Vladimirovich, would be installed as Tsar. It was suggested that Grand Duke Andrei should join the White army of General Anton Denikin, but the grand duchess opposed the idea, stating that members of the Romanov <b>family</b> <b>should</b> not take part in Russia's civil war.|$|E
25|$|To hear Edward's voice, Bella {{attempts}} cliff-diving {{and nearly}} drowns, {{but she is}} saved by Jacob. Edward, after mistakenly being informed that Bella has committed suicide, travels to Volterra, Italy, to request the Volturi to destroy him. Alice returns to Forks and discovers Bella is alive; she and Bella pursue Edward to Italy and successfully prevent him from showing himself in daylight to humans, an act {{that would result in}} his execution. The trio are taken to the Volturi. Because Bella knows about vampires, the Volturi want to kill her, but Alice claims she has foreseen Bella becoming a vampire. Because most humans are unaware that vampires exist, the Volturi threaten to kill Bella if this does not happen soon. Upon returning home, Edward tells Bella that he never stopped loving her, and he only left Forks because he thought it would protect her. He apologizes for his misguided action and asks for her forgiveness, which Bella quickly grants. Bella, intent on becoming a vampire, decides that Edward's <b>family</b> <b>should</b> vote on her fate. All but Rosalie and Edward vote for her to be changed, but Edward agrees to change her himself if she will marry him.|$|E
