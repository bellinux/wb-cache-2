40|$|We {{construct}} an empirical model for daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily lows of US stock indexes {{based on the}} intuition that <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows do not drift apart over time. Our empirical results show that daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows of three main US stock price indexes are cointegrated. Data on openings, closings, and trading volume are found to offer incremental explanatory power for variations in <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows within the VECM framework. With all these variables, the augmented VECM models explain 40 â 50 % of variations in daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> lows. The generalized impulse response analysis shows that the responses of daily <b>highs</b> <b>and</b> daily lows to the shocks depend on whether data on openings, closings, and trading volume {{are included in the}} analysis.
