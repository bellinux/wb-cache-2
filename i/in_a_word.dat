5|$|Meanwhile, Microsoft began {{introducing}} {{its most}} prominent office products. Microsoft Works, an integrated office program which combined features typically found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> processor, spreadsheet, database and other office applications, saw its first release as {{an application for}} the Apple Macintosh {{towards the end of}} 1986. Microsoft Works would later be sold with other Microsoft products including Microsoft Word and Microsoft Bookshelf, a reference collection introduced in 1987 that was the company's first CD-ROM product. Later, on August 8, 1989, Microsoft introduced its most successful office product, Microsoft Office. Unlike the model of Microsoft Works, Microsoft Office was a bundle of separate office productivity applications, such as Microsoft Word, Microsoft Excel and so forth. While Microsoft Word and Microsoft Office were mostly developed internally, Microsoft also continued its trend of rebranding products from other companies, such as Microsoft SQL Server on January 13, 1988, a relational database management system for companies that was based on technology licensed from Sybase.|$|E
5|$|The {{best thing}} of all is that the Greeks should not {{go to war with}} each other at all, but give the gods hearty thanks if by all {{speaking}} with one voice, and joining hands like people crossing a stream, {{they may be able to}} repel the attacks of barbarians and save themselves and their cities. But if this is altogether impossible, in the present juncture at least we ought to be unanimous and on our guard, when we see the bloated armaments and the vast proportions assumed by the war in the west. For even now it is evident to any one who pays even a moderate attention to public affairs, that whether the Carthaginians conquer the Romans, or the Romans the Carthaginians, it is in every way improbable that the victors will remain contented with the empire of Sicily and Italy. They will move forward: and will extend their forces and their designs farther than we could wish. Wherefore, I beseech you all to be on your guard against the danger of the crisis, and above all you, O King. You will do this, if you abandon the policy of weakening the Greeks, and thus rendering them an easy prey to the invader; and consult on the contrary for their good as you would for your own person, and have a care for all parts of Greece alike, as part and parcel of your own domains. If you act in this spirit, the Greeks will be your warm friends and faithful coadjutors in all your undertakings; while foreigners will be less ready to form designs against you, seeing with dismay the firm loyalty of the Greeks. If you are eager for action, turn your eyes to the west, and let your thoughts dwell upon the wars in Italy. Wait with coolness the turn of events there, and seize the opportunity to strike for universal dominion. Nor is the present crisis unfavourable for such a hope. But I intreat of you to postpone your controversies and wars with the Greeks to a time of greater tranquillity; and make it your supreme aim to retain the power of making peace or war with them at your own will. For if once you allow the clouds now gathering in the west to settle upon Greece, I fear exceedingly that the power of making peace or war, and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> all these games which we are now playing against each other, will be so completely knocked out of the hands of us all, that we shall be praying heaven to grant us only this power of making war or peace with each other at our own will and pleasure, and of settling our own disputes.|$|E

5|$|Words {{with three}} or more syllables, {{if they are not}} compounds, are mostly loanwords, usually derived from Pali, Sanskrit, or more recently, French. They are {{nonetheless}} adapted to Khmer stress patterns. Primary stress falls on the final syllable, with secondary stress on every second syllable from the end. Thus <b>in</b> <b>a</b> three-syllable <b>word,</b> the first syllable has secondary stress; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> four-syllable <b>word,</b> the second syllable has secondary stress; <b>in</b> <b>a</b> five-syllable <b>word,</b> the first and third syllables have secondary stress, and so on.

25|$|The hyphen, in particular, is used medially in {{some words}} to {{indicate}} the glottal stop san-o ‘when’ gab-e ‘evening; night’.

25|$|Written accents {{are also}} used {{occasionally}} in poetry and scripts for dramatic performances to indicate that a certain normally unstressed syllable <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word</b> should be stressed for dramatic effect, or to keep with the metre of the poetry.

25|$|Syllable {{deletion}} – stressed syllables are emphasis {{that may}} be given to certain syllables <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>word.</b> They {{are more likely to}} be retained in children's pronunciation than unstressed syllables (less emphasis on the sound) because they are more salient to children in an early language acquisition process.
