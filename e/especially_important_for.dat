5|$|The record Vainio {{had worked}} on during {{the final years of}} his life was {{released}} posthumously by Scandia in 1991 as Viiskymppisen viisut ("Tunes of a Fifty-year-old"). <b>Especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> Vainio had been the song Kauan sitten ("Long Ago") which he had recorded in the early 1970s. Vainio's most important collaborator during his last years was producer Jaakko Salo.|$|E
5|$|Berneray and Mingulay form an {{important}} breeding site for around {{a hundred thousand}} pairs of seabirds, and are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> the razorbill, the two islands having at least 2.0% of the UK's breeding population in 1985. Other species present include a variety of gulls, guillemots, puffins, kittiwakes, shags and (since 1899) fulmars. The island is largely covered by maritime grassland, with some machair and heath. Primrose, violets, yellow flag iris and celandine grow abundantly and grey seals are regularly seen by the landing cove. The island is designated as an SSSI and (with Mingulay) is a Special Protection Area.|$|E
5|$|Ninety-five {{per cent}} of bird species are {{socially}} monogamous. These species pair {{for at least}} the length of the breeding season or—in some cases—for several years or until the death of one mate. Monogamy allows for both paternal care and biparental care, which is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> species in which females require males' assistance for successful brood-rearing. Among many socially monogamous species, extra-pair copulation (infidelity) is common. Such behaviour typically occurs between dominant males and females paired with subordinate males, but may also be the result of forced copulation in ducks and other anatids.|$|E

5|$|The European Union's Restriction of Hazardous Substances Directive (RoHS) for {{reduction}} of lead has broadened bismuth's use in electronics {{as a component}} of low-melting point solders, as a replacement for traditional tin-lead solders. Its low toxicity will be <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> solders to be used in food processing equipment and copper water pipes, although it can also be used in other applications including those in the automobile industry, in the EU for example.|$|E
5|$|Even a {{slightly}} dehydrated horse is {{at higher risk}} of developing impaction colic. Additionally, dehydration can lead to weight loss because the horse cannot produce adequate amounts of saliva, thus decreasing the amount of feed and dry forage consumed. Thus, it is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> horse owners to encourage their horses to drink {{when there is a}} risk of dehydration; when horses are losing a great deal of water in hot weather due to strenuous work, or in cold weather due to horses' natural tendency to drink less when in a cold environment. To encourage drinking, owners may add electrolytes to the feed, additives to make the water especially palatable (such as apple juice), or, when it is cold, to warm the water so that it is not at a near-freezing temperature.|$|E
5|$|Touching is an {{important}} form of communication among elephants. Individuals greet each other by stroking or wrapping their trunks; the latter also occurs during mild competition. Older elephants use trunk-slaps, kicks, and shoves to discipline younger ones. Individuals of any age and sex will touch each other's mouths, temporal glands, and genitals, particularly during meetings or when excited. This allows individuals to pick up chemical cues. Touching is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> mother–calf communication. When moving, elephant mothers will touch their calves with their trunks or feet when side-by-side or with their tails if the calf is behind them. If a calf wants to rest, it will press against its mother's front legs and when it wants to suckle, it will touch her breast or leg.|$|E
50|$|By the 1890s diverse small-farming (fruit and dairy) had {{replaced}} the cattle-and-timber economy of earlier decades. Sugar cane and pineapples proved <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> produce <b>for</b> the district. Many small hamlets and towns now emerged. Produce was initially taken by horse to Landsborough, then to Eudlo in 1891.|$|R

5|$|Astatine's {{alpha decay}} {{energies}} {{follow the same}} trend as for other heavy elements. Lighter astatine isotopes have quite high energies of alpha decay, which become lower as the nuclei become heavier. Astatine-211 has a significantly higher energy than the previous isotope, {{because it has a}} nucleus with 126 neutrons, and 126 is a magic number corresponding to a filled neutron shell. Despite having a similar half-life to the previous isotope (8.1hours for astatine-210 and 7.2hours for astatine-211), the alpha decay probability is much higher for the latter: 41.81% against only 0.18%. The two following isotopes release even more energy, with astatine-213 releasing the most energy. For this reason, it is the shortest-lived astatine isotope. Even though heavier astatine isotopes release less energy, no long-lived astatine isotope exists, because of the increasing role of beta decay (electron emission). This decay mode is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> astatine; as early as 1950 it was postulated that all isotopes of the element undergo beta decay. Beta decay modes have been found for all astatine isotopes except astatine-213, -214, -215, and -216m. Astatine-210 and lighter isotopes exhibit beta plus decay (positron emission), astatine-216 and heavier isotopes exhibit beta (minus) decay, and astatine-212 decays via both modes, while astatine-211 undergoes electron capture.|$|E

30|$|Commonly, mobile devices {{depend on}} a battery as the energy source. However, a battery’s energy density does not scale {{at the same rate}} as an IC’s {{physical}} size. Consequently, the battery size has become major bottleneck on the path to further miniaturization of mobile systems, which is <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> parameter <b>for</b> the implantable telemetry.|$|R
25|$|Administrations {{are often}} under-resourced, {{resources}} aren't effectively targeted on areas of greatest impact, and mid-level management is weak.

25|$|It is {{estimated}} that 30 to 50 million Americans have some degree of lactose intolerance. Certain populations are more affected than others, including 75% of African American, Jewish, Mexican and Native American, and 90% of Asian populations.

Intrinsic cues (based on the target information) and mnemonic cues (based on previous JOL performance) are <b>especially</b> <b>important</b> <b>for</b> JOLs.
