60|$|It is charming then to see {{the girls}} urge one another to dance; each vows with much {{dramatic}} gesture that she cannot, calling the Blessed Virgin to witness that she has strained her ankle and has a shocking cold. But some youth springs up and volunteers, inviting a particular damsel to join him. She is pushed forward, and the couple take their places. The man carefully puts down his cigarette, jams his broad-brimmed hat on his <b>head,</b> <b>buttons</b> his short coat and arches his back! The spectators cry: 'Ole!' The girl passes an arranging hand over her hair. The measure begins. The pair stand opposite one another, a yard or so distant, and foot it in accordance with one another's motions. It is not a thing of complicated steps, but, {{as one might expect}} from its Moorish origin, of movements of the body. With much graceful swaying from side to side the executants approach and retire, and at the middle of the dance change positions. It finishes with a great clapping of hands, the maiden sinks down among her friends and begins violently to fan herself, while her partner, with a great affectation of nonchalance, takes a seat and relights his cigarette.|$|R

5000|$|At the [...] Brawn {{suffered}} the same uncompetitiveness after experiencing their worst qualifying {{of the season}} with Button in eighth and Barrichello in thirteenth. The reason for Barrichello's underperformance was caused by his rear suspension failing resulting in a spring falling off and subsequently striking Ferrari's Felipe Massa on the helmet resulting in serious <b>head</b> injuries. <b>Button</b> too was affected by this as his car spent most of Q3 being checked to make sure the same components would not fail and ended up qualifying with much more fuel than planned. In the race neither driver showed much pace although when the temperature hit 40 °C Button was the fastest man on the track at that point. Button managed to repass Trulli through the final pit stops and finished seventh with his teammate in tenth closely behind Nakajima and Trulli.|$|R

40|$|An {{improved}} tensile adhesion button {{has been}} designed and tested that results in higher measured tensile adhesion strength while providing increased capability for testing high strength epoxy adhesive systems. The best attributes of two well-established tensile button designs were combined and refined into an optimized tensile button. The most significant design change to the tensile button was to improve alignment of the bonded tensile button specimens during tensile testing by changing the interface between the tensile button and the tensile test machine. The established or old button design uses a test fixture that pulls from a grooved annulus or anvil head while the new button design pulls from a threaded hole in the centerline of the button. Finite element (FE) analysis showed that asymmetric loading of the established anvil <b>head</b> tensile <b>button</b> significantly increases the stress concentration in the adhesive, causing failure at lower tensile test loads. The new tensile button was designed to eliminate asymmetric loading and eliminate misalignment sensitivity. Enhanced alignment resulted in improved tensile adhesion strength measurement up to 13. 8 MPa (2000 psi) over the established button design. Another design change increased the capability of the button by increasing the threaded hole diameter allowing it to test high strength epoxy systems up to 85 MPa(less than 12, 000 psi). The improved tensile button {{can be used in}} button- to-button or button-to-panel configurations...|$|R

5000|$|The {{origin of}} the common name [...] "Barbara's buttons" [...] is unknown. The flower <b>heads</b> do {{resemble}} <b>buttons,</b> but botanical references giving this name do not quote the Barbara which the name honors (Rickett 1975). The reference is possibly to Saint Barbara, though the association is obscure. Saint Barbara had long hair, and is also associated with lightning—perhaps the individual flowers resemble lightning bolts, or the whole head of flowers resembles Saint Barbara's long locks (Coin 2005). This common name was not, at any rate, widespread in the 19th century. It was not used in Southern Wildflowers and Trees (1901) or Plant Life Of Alabama (1901). The botanist B.W. Wells, in Natural Gardens of North Carolina (1932), called the plants [...] "loudspeakers", referring to the megaphone shape of the individual flowers. The first printed use of the name [...] "Barbara's buttons" [...] is in Small's Manual of the Southeastern Flora (1933).|$|R

These objects are perched on stools, and depicted {{as if they were}} sculpture, as in the Picassos of 1930. I have no doubt of Mr. Bacon's uncommon gifts, but these pictures expressing his sense of the atrocious world into which we have survived seems [...] symbols of outrage rather than works of art. If peace redresses him, he may delight as he now dismays." [...] Reflecting on the reaction of critics and the public, Bacon offered, [...] "I've never known why my paintings are known as horrible. I'm always labelled with horror, but I never think about horror. Pleasure is such a diverse thing. And horror is too. Can you call the famous Isenheim altar a horror piece? Its one of the greatest paintings of the Crucifixion, with the body studded with thorns like nails, but oddly enough the form is so grand it takes away from the horror. But that is the horror {{in the sense that it}} is so vitalising; isn't that how people came out of the great tragedies? People came out as though purged into happiness, into a fuller reality of existence." ...|$|R
25|$|Hamilton {{closed the}} gap to Rosberg to be 1.9 seconds behind his {{teammate}} {{by the start of}} lap 50. Rosberg made his third (and final) pit stop from the lead on the same lap. Hamilton pushed hard following Rosberg's pit stop and made his own stop on the next lap and emerged narrowly behind his teammate (after being delayed by slower traffic) in second. Massa and Button made pit stops on the same lap and both drivers left the pit lane in fifth and sixth places. Button had closed up to Massa after the latter drove into the incorrect pit box. Hülkenberg was promoted into third but lost the position to Massa heading into the Senna chicane on the 54th lap. Hamilton attacked but Rosberg responded by going faster than his teammate in the middle sector but Hamilton was able to remain close with DRS assistance on the main straights. The two drivers pulled away from Massa and Button. Rosberg and Hamilton came across slower traffic but it did not affect them greatly enough to cause hindrance. On lap 61, Räikkönen—who was on 25-lap worn tyres—was pressured by <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> into the Senna chicane but Räikkönen resisted the manoeuvre. Button held the racing line and went alongside Räikkönen on the back straight before eventually passing him around the outside at the Descida do Lago turn. Räikkönen lost momentum at the corner and was passed by Vettel. Alonso began to battle teammate Räikkönen who placed his car in a defensive position over the following few laps.|$|R
50|$|On lap 39 di Resta forced Pérez wide at turn 13; as Pérez {{rejoined the}} circuit, he cut {{back across the}} front of Grosjean and the two made contact at the next corner, which in turn forced Grosjean into the path of Webber who was {{attempting}} to drive on the inside line. Grosjean and Webber retired because of damage to their cars and the debris on-track from the accident called for the second safety car period of the race. The safety remained out for three laps, during which marshals cleared the track of debris. Pérez was given a ten-second stop-go penalty by the stewards on the 42nd lap for which he served three laps later. Räikkönen began to rebuild his lead over Alonso once the safety car came in on the end of lap 42. Alonso was also being harried by Button; Button himself was being harried by Vettel in fourth. Vettel was in the tow of <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> towards turn eight and got a run on the McLaren driver driving into turn eleven but was unable to pass. Button and Vettel's duel allowed Alonso to break free, and he started chasing down Räikkönen in the last five laps. Vettel tried again on lap 48 and took the outside line to attempt a pass heading into turn eleven, but Button defended his position. Four laps later Vettel lined up another passing manoeuvre on Button (who went wide heading into turn ten) by employing his DRS in the run up to turn eleven and passed the McLaren driver around the outside to take over third place.|$|R
5000|$|Trulli {{improved}} his car {{on all of}} his timed laps and drafted off teammate Button on his fastest lap to secure eleventh place but lost time after running very closely behind <b>Button</b> <b>heading</b> into the Curva Parabolica corner. Fisichella had a strategy to run two timed laps but his final run disrupted because of the Räikkönen and Sato incident which restricted Fisichella to twelfth. He later said he hoped of a possibility to qualify tenth and was struggling for grip. He was ahead of McNish in the slower Toyota who was satisfied despite being delayed by traffic on his second run. McNish {{was in front of}} the two Saubers (with Massa ahead of Heidfeld); Massa used scrubbed tyres which provided him with more front-end grip on his first timed run but had a large amount of understeer after new tyres were installed on his car. More downforce was added to Massa's car for his final run. Heidfeld ran wide at Curva di Lesmo's exit on his final timed lap which prevented him from recording a faster lap time. [...] Panis was sixteenth in the second BAR with Button sharing the eighth row in seventeenth. Despite the incident with Räikkonen Sato took eighteenth and said [...] "That was the most difficult qualifying session of my career". Sato had also made driving mistakes meaning he could not set a representative lap time. The two Minardi cars lined up on the final row of the grid with Webber ahead of the returning Yoong; both Webber and Yoong were affected by the red-flag period and Yoong lost his final two timed laps as a consequence.|$|R
