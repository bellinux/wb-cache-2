40|$|The {{safety of}} <b>highway</b> {{construction}} and <b>maintenance</b> workers {{is a major}} concern today. For every billion dollars spent on road construction, 33 people are killed in accidents related to that work. Work zone housekeeping is an important element in reducing accidents. This housekeeping involves moving traffic control devices on and off the road. This work is both time consuming and very dangerous. Much research has been done in highway construction robots, <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> robots, and “smart ” highways. One goal of this work is to improve safety in <b>highway</b> construction and <b>maintenance</b> <b>areas.</b> The work done in this thesis focuses on a system of robotic safety markers (RSMs). In this system, each safety marker is a robot. Each of these robots can move inde-pendently, and are controlled by a more sophisticated lead robot. These markers can self-deploy and self-retrieve, removing workers from this dangerous task. The system is designed for high reliability and low per-robot cost. The details on the hardware and software design of the RSMs are given. The electrical design and software architecture are discussed in detail. The software con...|$|R

40|$|During the 1980 - 81 fiscal year, the Office of Transportation Research {{conducted}} a study to examine the existing locations of <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> garages in a study area provided by the Office of Maintenance.

40|$|<b>Highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> {{engineers}} and administrators are often {{confronted with a}} number of problems related to <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> work programs. One of these problems is concerned with determining the optimum number and locations of <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> garages in a given area. Serious decline in highway revenues and a high inflation rate have made it necessary to examine existing maintenance practices and to allocate reduced financial resources more effectively and efficiently. Searching for and providing of reasonable solutions to these problems is the focus of this research project. The methodology used is to identify and modify for use (if necessary) those models which have already been developed. Models which could give optimum number and locations of <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> garages were found to be too theoretical and/or practically infeasible. Consequently, research focus was shifted from these models to other models that could compare alternatives and select the best among these alternatives.

It is known named after the highway’s concessionaire, Projek Lebuhraya Utara Selatan Berhad (North South Expressway Project) abbreviated as PLUS Expressway. A study on the occupational safety among maintenance workers of PLUS Expressway was conducted. The aim for this research is to identify the hazards and determine the risk level of <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> works.

40|$|Discussion is {{occurring}} in many states on whether the outsourcing of traditional categories of state-provided <b>highway</b> <b>maintenance</b> could produce savings in costs or improvements in service.
