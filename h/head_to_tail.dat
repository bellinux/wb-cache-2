5|$|Planarians, a {{subgroup}} of seriates, {{are famous for}} their ability to regenerate if divided by cuts across their bodies. Experiments show that, in fragments that do not already have a head, a new head grows most quickly on those closest to the original head. This suggests the growth of a head is controlled by a chemical whose concentration diminishes from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail.</b> Many turbellarians clone themselves by transverse or longitudinal division, and others, especially acoels, reproduce by budding.|$|E
5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the third week of development, the embryonic ectoderm forms a thickened strip called the neural plate. By the fourth week of development the neural plate has widened to give a broad cephalic end, a less broad middle part and a narrow caudal end. These swellings represent {{the beginning}}s of the forebrain, midbrain and hindbrain. Neural crest cells (derived from the ectoderm) populate the lateral edges of the plate at the neural folds. In the fourth week in the neurulation stage the neural plate folds and closes to form the neural tube, bringing together the neural crest cells at the neural crest. The neural crest runs the length of the tube with cranial neural crest cells at the cephalic end and caudal neural crest cells at the tail. Cells detach from the crest and migrate in a craniocaudal (<b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail)</b> wave inside the tube. Cells at the cephalic end give rise to the brain, and cells at the caudal end give rise to the spinal cord.|$|E
5|$|Protosuchians were small, mostly {{terrestrial}} animals with short snouts and long limbs. They had bony armor {{in the form}} of two rows of plates extending from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail,</b> and this armor is retained by most modern crocodilians. Their vertebrae were convex on the two main articulating surfaces, and their bony palates were little developed. The mesosuchians saw a fusion of the palatine bones to form a secondary bony palate and a great extension of the nasal passages to near the pterygoid bones. This allowed the animal to breathe through its nostrils while its mouth was open under the water. The eusuchians continued this process with the interior nostrils now opening through an aperture in the pterygoid bones. The vertebrae of eusuchians had one convex and one concave articulating surface, allowing for a ball and socket type joint between the vertebrae, bringing greater flexibility and strength. The oldest known eusuchian is Hylaeochampsa vectiana from the lower Cretaceous of the Isle of Wight in the United Kingdom. It was followed by crocodilians such as the Pristichampsidae, the so-called 'hoofed crocodiles', in the Palaeogene. Spanning the Cretaceous and Palaeogene periods is the genus Borealosuchus of North America, with six species, though its phylogenetic position is not settled.|$|E

5000|$|Humans are {{not good}} at randomizing. They may try to produce [...] "random" [...] {{sequences}} by switching their actions from <b>Heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>Tails</b> and vice versa, but they switch their actions too often (due to a gambler's fallacy). This {{makes it possible for}} expert players to predict their next actions with more than 50% chance of success. In this way, a positive expected payoff might be attainable.|$|R

25|$|Males {{of these}} species are {{competitive}} and territorial. Males display to each other by positioning themselves parallel to each other, <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail,</b> with dorsal and caudal fins erect and cheek odontode spines everted. If this escalates to combat, the males will circle each other and direct attacks at the head. If an intruding male manages to evict another male from the nest, it may cannibalize the other male's young.|$|E
25|$|It is a {{derivative}} of gramicidin, {{produced by the}} gram-positive bacterium Bacillus brevis. Gramicidin S is a cyclodecapeptide, constructed as two identical pentapeptides joined <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail,</b> formally written as cyclo(-Val-Orn-Leu-D-Phe-Pro-)2. That is to say, it forms a ring structure composed of five different amino acids, each one used twice within the structure. Another interesting point is that it utilizes two amino acids uncommon in peptides: ornithine {{as well as the}} atypical stereoisomer of phenylalanine. It is synthesized by gramicidin S synthetase.|$|E
50|$|As {{an example}} that will be {{familiar}} to all, if a fair coin is tossed many times {{and the number of}} heads and tails counted, the ratio of <b>heads</b> <b>to</b> <b>tails</b> will be very close to 1 (about as many heads as tails); but after only a few throws, outcomes with a significant excess of heads over tails or vice versa are common; if an experiment with a few throws is repeated over and over, the outcomes will fluctuate a lot.|$|R

25|$|Use of {{the virus}} does present some disadvantages. The cloning {{capacity}} of the vector is relatively limited and most therapeutic genes require the complete replacement {{of the virus}}'s 4.8 kilobase genome.

The AAV ITRs of two genomes can anneal to form <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> concatamers, almost doubling the capacity of the vector. Insertion of splice sites allows for the removal of the ITRs from the transcript.|$|E
25|$|In {{terms of}} development, the human {{central nervous system}} is often {{classified}} based on the original three primitive vesicles from which it develops: These primary vesicles form in the normal development of the neural tube of the embryo and initially include the prosencephalon, mesencephalon, and rhombencephalon, in rostral to caudal (from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail)</b> orientation. Later in development {{of the nervous system}} each section itself turns into smaller components. During development, the cells that migrate tangentially to form the basal ganglia are directed by the lateral and medial ganglionic eminences. The following table demonstrates this developmental classification and traces it to the anatomic structures found in the basal ganglia. The structures relevant to the basal ganglia are shown in bold.|$|E

500|$|The {{sea mink}} {{was the largest}} of the minks. As only fragmentary {{skeletal}} remains of the sea mink exist, most of its external measurements are speculative and rely only on dental measurements. In 1929, Ernest Seton, a wildlife artist, concluded that the probable dimensions for this animal are [...] from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail,</b> with the tail being [...] long. [...] A possible mounted sea mink specimen collected in 1894 in Connecticut measured [...] from <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> and the tail was [...] in length; a 1996 study found this to be either a large American mink or possibly a hybrid. The specimen was described as having coarse fur that was reddish-tan in color, though much of it was likely faded from age. It was darkest at the tail and the hind limbs, with a [...] white patch between the forearms. There were also white spots on the left forearm and the groin region.|$|E

500|$|Moulting is {{repeated}} periodically throughout a snake's life. Before a moult, the snake stops eating and often hides or {{moves to a}} safe place. Just before shedding, the skin becomes dull and dry looking and the eyes become cloudy or blue-colored. The inner surface of the old outer skin liquefies. This causes the old outer skin to separate from the new inner skin. After a few days, the eyes clear and the snake [...] "crawls" [...] out of its old skin. The old skin breaks near the mouth and the snake wriggles out aided by rubbing against rough surfaces.

40|$|Previous {{studies found}} that RdgC protein {{plays a role in}} the DNA repair system in Escherichia coli. In recBC sbcBC strains, loss of rdgC made growth of the strains {{dependent}} upon recombination, hence Recombination Dependent Growth. RdgC was also found to regulate the activity of RecA, a key protein in recombination, both in vivo and in vitro. The function of the protein, however, remains unknown. In this study, I purified and crystallised the RdgC protein. The crystal structure of the protein was then revealed as a homo-dimer, with a <b>head</b> <b>to</b> <b>head,</b> <b>tail</b> <b>to</b> <b>tail</b> organisation, resembling a ring structure. To further investigate how RdgC binds DNA and its in vivo functionality, point mutations and chunk deletions were designed and constructed; and I examined all the mutant proteins in DNA binding shift assays in vitro and in synthetic lethality assays in vivo. A DNA binding model was then proposed {{based on the results of}} the DNA binding shift assays.
