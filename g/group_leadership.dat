500|$|Stevenson {{considered}} housing, uniforms, and recruit {{training to}} be her first priorities after taking up her appointment. On arriving at No.1 WAAAF Depot in Malvern, Victoria, she was [...] "shattered at the prison-like atmosphere of the place". She drew on her retail experience to organise the WAAAF and to design its uniform. Stevenson was promoted to wing officer on 1 October 1941, and group officer on 1 April 1942, {{which was to be}} the highest rank attained by a serving WAAAF member. She took an active interest in recruitment, her liberal social outlook evinced by her determination that single women with children should not be barred from entry to the WAAAF. To establish high standards, Stevenson personally interviewed all WAAAF officer trainees and briefed as many of them as possible before they were posted to a new job. She was quoted in the Adelaide Advertiser as saying, [...] "When interviewing applicants, I always point out the hardships of the service, so that no one will come in on a rush of enthusiasm and regret it later." [...] Stevenson also worked to maintain the morale of personnel, encouraging officers to attend <b>group</b> <b>leadership</b> courses and organise leisure and sporting activities for their staff. Colonel Sybil Irving, the head of the Australian Women's Army Service (AWAS), who observed first hand the WAAAF's training methods before large-scale AWAS recruitment commenced, later declared that Stevenson [...] "did the most pertinent pioneering work" [...] in gaining acceptance for women in the armed forces. For her part, Stevenson considered the role of Director [...] "a difficult job and often a lonely one".|$|E

2500|$|The first {{election}} for the <b>group</b> <b>leadership</b> was also scheduled for 14 July 2009, pitting interim leader Kirkhope against fellow Briton Geoffrey Van Orden. [...] However, both Conservative leadership candidates {{were forced to}} forfeit the leadership {{in order to prevent}} it from falling apart, when then-Conservative MEP Edward McMillan-Scott defied his party whip and stood for one of the vice-presidency posts despite pledges the previous week that Polish MEP Michał Kamiński would be backed for it. Kamiński's bid for Vice-President of the European Parliament subsequently failed, and the Polish MEPs threatened to abandon the new caucus unless Kamiński was made the group leader in the parliament. Kirkhope went to an emergency meeting with Polish MEPs in Strasbourg and proposed sharing the <b>group</b> <b>leadership</b> with the Kamiński; however, this was not accepted, and he had to step down as coalition leader, withdrawing in favour of Kamiński. McMillan-Scott, who alleged that the Conservative's new allies in Poland are 'racist and homophobic', had the Conservative whip withdrawn in the European Parliament. In March 2010, McMillan-Scott joined the British Liberal Democrats and the ALDE group.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{commonly}} {{thought that}} Cowsill's {{involvement with the}} family band {{came to an abrupt}} end in 1969 when his father, Bud, caught him smoking marijuana, and he was immediately expelled by his father from the group.

[...] State troopers had to be called to break up the fight between father and son. [...] Billy Cowsill was dismissed from the group the next day. [...] According to his brother Bob, Billy Cowsill's dismissal {{was the beginning of the}} end of the Cowsills as a group, since no other sibling could effectively assume their eldest brother's <b>group</b> <b>leadership</b> role.|$|E
