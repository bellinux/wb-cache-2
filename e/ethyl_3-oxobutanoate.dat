5000|$|A {{large number}} of {{alternative}} synthetic routes to amphetamine have been developed based on classic organic reactions. One example is the Friedel-Crafts alkylation of benzene by allyl chloride to yield beta chloropropylbenzene which is then reacted with ammonia to produce racemic amphetamine (method 2). [...] Another example employs the Ritter reaction (method 3). In this route, allylbenzene is reacted acetonitrile in sulfuric acid to yield an organosulfate {{which in turn is}} treated with sodium hydroxide to give amphetamine via an acetamide intermediate. A third route starts with <b>ethyl</b> <b>3-oxobutanoate</b> which through a double alkylation with methyl iodide followed by benzyl chloride can be converted into 2-methyl-3-phenyl-propanoic acid. This synthetic intermediate can be transformed into amphetamine using either a Hofmann or Curtius rearrangement (method 4).|$|E
