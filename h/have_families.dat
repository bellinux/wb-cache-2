25|$|H-2A visas are {{temporary}} visas {{that allow}} {{people from other}} countries {{to work in the}} United States, with some benefits contractors need to provide to them.

Yet, the circumstances of the law states for free housing, “prevailing practice in the area and occupation of intended employment”.

25|$|The use of Cognitive Behavioral Therapy (CBT) {{has been}} shown to be quite {{effective}} for treating bulimia nervosa (BN) in adults, but little research has been done on effective treatments of BN for adolescents. Although CBT is seen as more cost efficient and helps individuals with BN in self-guided care, Family Based Treatment (FBT) might be more helpful to younger adolescents who need more support and guidance from their families. Adolescents are at the stage where their brains are still quite malleable and developing gradually. Therefore, young adolescents with BN are less likely to realize the detrimental consequences of becoming bulimic and have less motivation to change, which is why FBT would be useful to <b>have</b> <b>families</b> intervene and support the teens. Working with BN patients and their families in FBT can empower the families by having them involved in their adolescent's food choices and behaviors, taking more control of the situation in the beginning and gradually letting the adolescent become more autonomous when they have learned healthier eating habits.|$|E

25|$|The best-known case of nanism {{in ancient}} Egypt {{is that of}} the high {{official}} Seneb, as a finely-carved statue-group of the dwarf and his family has survived in excellent preservation. Seneb worked during the late 4th Dynasty (c. 26132494 BC) or early 5th Dynasty (c. 24982345 BC), most possibly under king Shepseskaf and his successors. Seneb was married to a normally grown woman named Senet-ites. He had two daughters named Awib-en-Khufu and Semeret-Radjedef and one son named Ankh-ima-Radjedef, all of whom are represented as of normal stature. This shows that it was accepted that dwarfs might <b>have</b> <b>families</b> and healthy children. Note that the two children shown in front of Seneb's seat in the accompanying illustration are in the position where the legs of a 'normal' statue would be represented, thus lessening - though not concealing - his abnormal appearance. Because Seneb's father was normally grown, Seneb's case also proves that not all dwarfs were brought from foreign countries, nanism occasionally occurring - as would be expected from modern experience - within Egyptian families. In other cases, where persons also having short stature are depicted as servants of other dwarfs, it is possible that {{they were part of the}} same family. However, this remains a matter for conjecture, as it was not uncommon during the Old Kingdom period, that artists depicted the same person multiple time in one scene. They did this to show that the main character performed several duties at the same time.|$|E

"Thanksgiving Orphans" [...] is {{the ninth}} {{episode of the}} fifth season of the American {{television}} sitcom, Cheers, co-written by Cheri Eichen and Bill Steinkeller and directed by James Burrows.

They gather for a Thanksgiving feast which degenerates into a food fight. Burrows filmed the food-fight scene (which was only partially choreographed) twice. The episode had a generally positive reception.

500|$|Darwin was {{intrigued}} by his half-cousin Francis Galton's argument, introduced in 1865, that statistical analysis of heredity showed that moral and mental human traits could be inherited, and principles of animal breeding could apply to humans. In The Descent of Man, Darwin noted that aiding the weak to survive and <b>have</b> <b>families</b> could lose the benefits of natural selection, but cautioned that withholding such aid would endanger the instinct of sympathy, [...] "the noblest part of our nature", and factors such as education could be more important. When Galton suggested that publishing research could encourage intermarriage within a [...] "caste" [...] of [...] "those who are naturally gifted", Darwin foresaw practical difficulties, and thought it [...] "the sole feasible, yet I fear utopian, plan of procedure in improving the human race", preferring to simply publicise the importance of inheritance and leave decisions to individuals.

She said the scene shows the writers and actors [...] "are not people afraid of letting an awkward, tension-filled scene breathe", and that kind of realism illustrates the strength of the show's writing and acting. Camille Wright Felton of CNN said she loved the show, and particularly praised the subplot about Haddie learning to drive, as well as Adam's response when Haddie asked if whether {{he and his wife had}} an agreement to ignore each other's flaws: [...] "Yeah, it's called marriage." [...] However, Felton criticized Baldwin's character, which she described as a [...] "single-minded boss who apparently exists as an island and doesn't get that people <b>have</b> <b>families</b> and need to tend to family crises". HitFix television columnist Alan Sepinwall felt the first half of the episode was too uneven in its mix of comedy and drama, but that it was later redeemed mainly by the scenes featuring Max, who he said [...] "is the one character on the show who never feels inauthentic, and he kind of pulls everyone toward him". Sepinwall praised the performance of Max Burkholder as Max, but described William Baldwin's character as a [...] "caricatured playboy boss".|$|E
