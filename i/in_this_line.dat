5|$|After {{graduating from}} Leeds, Armstrong taught French in East Ham, Greater London for several years; she had success <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> of work, and {{was well on}} her way to {{becoming}} headmistress by the time she left this position in 1918. While she was Senior Assistant Mistress, she began studying phonetics in the evenings part-time at the University College Phonetics Department in order to improve her teaching of French pronunciation. In 1917, Armstrong received a Diploma with Distinction in French Phonetics; she got a Diploma with Distinction in English phonetics the following year.|$|E
5|$|Jewish {{philosophy}} {{divides the}} 613 mitzvot into three groups—laws {{that have a}} rational explanation and would probably be enacted by most orderly societies (mishpatim), laws that are understood after being explained but would not be legislated without the Torah's command (edot), and laws {{that do not have}} a rational explanation (chukim). Some Jewish scholars say that kashrut should be categorized as laws {{for which there is no}} particular explanation, since the human mind is not always capable of understanding divine intentions. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> of thinking, the dietary laws were given as a demonstration of God's authority, and man must obey without asking why. However, Maimonides believed that Jews were permitted to seek out reasons for the laws of the Torah.|$|E
5|$|Not {{until the}} 21st century did players and analysts begin to revive Black's chances <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line.</b> First, Watson {{showed that the}} {{disruptive}} check 9...Qh4+ was playable, the point being that after 10.g3 White is {{no longer able to}} bring the bishop on c1 to the squares g3 or h4, where it can assist in White's kingside attack. Later players such as Gashimov showed that the queen check is not mandatory, and that Black also retains good chances in the line 9...0-0 10.Nf3 Na6 11.0-0 Nb4, taking advantage of the outpost on b4.|$|E

5|$|Traditionally, {{breakers}} dance {{within a}} cypher or an Apache Line. A cypher is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in. Cyphers {{work well for}} one-on-one b-boy or b-girl (break-boy/break-girl) battles; however, Apache Lines are more appropriate when the battle is between two crews—teams of street dancers. In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher, competing crews can face each other <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> formation, challenge each other, and execute their burns (a move intended to humiliate the opponent, i.e. crotch grabbing).|$|E
5|$|Of Irish descent, O'Reilly's {{paternal}} grandfather Peter {{emigrated from}} Co Cavan, Ulster in 1865. Arriving in Sydney, {{he had been}} a policeman for four years in Ireland and continued <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> of work in New South Wales. After a period, he was sent to Deniliquin in the Riverina, where he settled and married another Irish immigrant Bridget O'Donoghue from Ballinasloe, Co. Galway. O'Reilly's father, Ernest, was a schoolteacher and moved around the areas surrounding the Murray River to study and teach. O'Reilly's mother Mina (née Welsh) was of mixed Irish and English descent, of a third generation family from Adelaide. O'Reilly was born in the opal mining town of White Cliffs, New South Wales. Ernest had been appointed to open the first school in the town, and had helped to build the school and its furniture himself. Bill was the fourth child in the family, with two elder brothers and a sister.|$|E

25|$|Divine Science, Unity Church, and Religious Science are {{organizations}} that {{developed from the}} New Thought movement. Each teaches that Infinite Intelligence, or God, is the sole reality.

25|$|A novel {{approach}} for testing the weak {{form of the}} Efficient Market Hypothesis is using quantifers derived from Information Theory. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>line,</b> Zunino et al. found that informational efficiency is related to market size and the stage of development of the economy. Using a similar technique, Bariviera et al. uncover the impact of important economic events on informational efficiency. The methodology proposed by econophysicists Zunino, Bariviera and coauthors is new and alternative to usual econometric techniques, {{and is able to}} detect changes in the stochastic and or chaotic underlying dynamics of prices time series.|$|E
25|$|After Bhaskaravarman's death {{without an}} heir, the kingdom {{passed into the}} hands of Salasthambha (655–670), an {{erstwhile}} local governor and a member of an aboriginal group called Mlechchha (or Mech), after a period of civil and political strife. This dynasty too drew its lineage from the Naraka dynasty, though it had no dynastic relationship with the previous Varman dynasty. The capital of this dynasty was Haruppeshvara, now identified with modern Dah Parbatiya near Tezpur. The kingdom took on feudal characteristics with political power shared between the king and second and third tier rulers called mahasamanta and samanta who enjoyed considerable autonomy. The last ruler <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> was Tyāga Singha (890–900).|$|E

25|$|White {{has a few}} pawn moves {{which do}} not lose material, but {{eventually}} {{he will have to}} move one of his pieces. If he plays 1.Rc1 or Rd1, then 1...Re2 traps White's queen; 1.Kh2 fails to 1...R5f3, also trapping the queen, since White cannot play 2.Bxf3 because the bishop is pinned to the king; 1.g4 runs into 1...R5f3 2.Bxf3? Rh2 mate. Angos analyzes 1.a3 a5 2.axb4 axb4 3.h4 Kh8 (waiting) 4.b3 Kg8 and White has run out of waiting moves and must lose material. Best <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> is 5.Nc3!? bxc3 6.bxc3, which just leaves Black with a serious positional advantage and an extra pawn. Other moves lose material in more obvious ways.|$|E
25|$|During {{this period}} Cousin {{seems to have}} turned with fresh {{interest}} to those literary studies which he had abandoned for speculation {{under the influence of}} Laromiguière and Royer-Collard. To this renewed interest we owe his studies of men and women of note in France in the 17th century. As the results of his work <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line,</b> we have, besides the Des Pensées de Pascal, 1842, Audes sur les femmes et la société du XVII siècle 1853. He has sketched Jacqueline Pascal (1844), Madame de Longueville (1853), the marquise de Sable (1854), the duchesse de Chevreuse (1856), Madame de Hautefort (1856). Cousin was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1855.|$|E
25|$|In 1889, 1890 and 1892 {{she made}} concert tours of Germany, {{including}} Dresden, Cologne and Leipzig, with performances of her piano concerto in A minor. In 1892 she married Wyndham Knatchbull (1829–1900), a {{captain of the}} 3rd Dragoon Guards and a great-grandson of Edward Knatchbull, 7thBaronet of MershamHatch. Thereafter she lived at Babington House in Babington, Somerset, and became a local leader of charitable amateur productions such as performances of Gilbert and Sullivan comic operas. From around 1897, her own piano concert performances tailed off. She changed direction towards composing music for dramatic performances. An early success <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> came in 1903 when The Dancing Girl and the Idol, an oriental fantasy with words by Edith Lyttelton, was given an amateur production at a prestigious charity event in Chatsworth House. In 1904, the piece was performed at Chatsworth again, by royal request, as King Edward had missed the 1903 performance through illness.|$|E

25|$|Non-human {{research}} {{still has}} a major place in this field, however, and is especially useful in illuminating which nonverbal behaviors signify components of theory of mind, and in pointing to possible stepping points {{in the evolution of}} what many claim to be a uniquely human aspect of social cognition. While it is difficult to study human-like theory of mind and mental states in species whose potential mental states we have an incomplete understanding, researchers can focus on simpler components of more complex capabilities. For example, many researchers focus on animals' understanding of intention, gaze, perspective, or knowledge (or rather, what another being has seen). Call and Tomasello's study that looked at understanding of intention in orangutans, chimpanzees and children showed that all three species understood the difference between accidental and intentional acts. Part of the difficulty <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> of research is that observed phenomena can often be explained as simple stimulus-response learning, {{as it is in the}} nature of any theorizers of mind to have to extrapolate internal mental states from observable behavior. Recently, most non-human theory of mind research has focused on monkeys and great apes, who are of most interest in the study of the evolution of human social cognition. Other studies relevant to attributions theory of mind have been conducted using plovers and dogs, and have shown preliminary evidence of understanding attention—one precursor of theory of mind—in others.|$|E

500|$|Fischer {{established}} {{the viability of}} the so-called Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian (1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6). This bold queen sortie, to snatch a pawn at the expense of development, had been considered dubious, but Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness. Out of ten tournament and match games as Black in the Poisoned Pawn, Fischer scored 70%, winning five, drawing four, and losing only one: the 11th game of his 1972 match against Spassky. Following Fischer's use, the Poisoned Pawn Variation became a respected line, utilized by many of the world's leading players. [...] Fischer's 10.f5 <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>line</b> against Efim Geller quickly became the main line of the Poisoned Pawn.|$|E
