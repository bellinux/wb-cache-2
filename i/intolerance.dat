5|$|Religious <b>intolerance</b> was one {{particular}} {{factor in the}} decline of the Pax Mongolica. In Rus', the Mongols (known as the Golden Horde), gradually lost power and territory due to <b>intolerance</b> specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus' Mongols converted to Islam and joined the Egyptian Mamluks for political reasons. At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the Persian Mongols. The eastern part of the Golden Horde, White Horde, had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The decentralisation occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the Persian Mongol leader Ghazan converted to Islam in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of Nawruz; a Muslim Oirat general.|$|E

40|$|Various {{estimates}} put {{the number}} of people affected by food allergies and <b>intolerances</b> in Ireland in the tens of thousands. However, this is a complex area where actual data on the overall number of people affected, as well as the prevalence of the various types of food allergies and <b>intolerances</b> are not available. Figures estimated for Ireland are largely extrapolated from data available in other countries such as the UK. In order to get a general indication of the food allergies and <b>intolerances</b> most prevalent in Ireland, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI) set up a web-based questionnaire asking five questions.

5|$|In {{veterinary}} practice, {{dogs are}} the species most commonly affected by hypothyroidism. The {{majority of cases}} occur {{as a result of}} primary hypothyroidism, of which two types are recognized: lymphocytic thyroiditis, which is probably immune-driven and leads to destruction and fibrosis of the thyroid gland, and idiopathic atrophy, which leads to the gradual replacement of the gland by fatty tissue. There is often lethargy, cold <b>intolerance,</b> exercise <b>intolerance,</b> and weight gain. Furthermore, skin changes and fertility problems are seen in dogs with hypothyroidism, {{as well as a number}} of other symptoms. The signs of myxedema can be seen in dogs, with prominence of skin folds on the forehead, and cases of myxedema coma are encountered. The diagnosis can be confirmed by blood test, as the clinical impression alone may lead to overdiagnosis. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is associated with detectable antibodies against thyroglobulin, although they typically become undetectable in advanced disease. Treatment is with thyroid hormone replacement.|$|E

40|$|Are food <b>intolerances</b> and allergies {{increasing}} in immigrant children coming from developing countries? In the last 25 yr the migratory flow from devel-oping countries towards Italy has quickly in-creased and to day {{a large part}} of the immigrant adults living in Italy has a regular residence permit and get married (1). Consequently, the number of infants born in Italy from immigrant parents and of immigrant children coming from their native countries to join their original families have largely increased during these last years [in December 2001 they were 326, 101 (1), amounting to 2 % of the entire paediatric popu-lation living in Italy]. These children share the same environment of the Italian ones and, whether they have also the same dietary habits as consequence of their integration with the customs of the Italian childhood population, may be at risk for food <b>intolerances</b> and allergies.

40|$|Food <b>intolerances</b> {{and food}} allergies are {{evolving}} and diagnoses of such conditions are rapidly increasing. Yet our ancient bodies and social resources are not adapting to this dynamic environment. Accessing healthcare and allergen-free foods {{is necessary for}} all people with food allergies and <b>intolerances,</b> but gaps in social resources complicate acquiring these resources, especially for low-income individuals. This interdisciplinary pilot study utilizes a mixed method approach, including sociologically and anthropologically-based surveys and participant observation, respectively, and is guided by the action research approach. Data analysis illustrates major gaps in access to healthcare, specifically to dietitians, and in food acquisition from government agencies and food pantries. All grocery stores {{included in this study}} have some amount of allergen-free foods, but knowledge of these products varies drastically. The paper is concluded with a resource-neutral plan of action that aims to enhance the lives of people who suffer from food <b>intolerances</b> in McLean County, Illinois...|$|R
5|$|Thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} hypothyroidism (lack of production of thyroxine (T4) and triiodothyronine (T3) in the thyroid). Typical symptoms are tiredness, <b>intolerance</b> to cold, constipation, weight gain, hair loss and slowed thinking, {{as well as}} a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure. In children, hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism.|$|E
5|$|A. ocellatus is {{native to}} Peru, Ecuador, Colombia, Brazil, and French Guiana, and occurs in the Amazon River basin, along the Amazon, Içá, Negro, Solimões, and Ucayali River systems, {{and also in the}} Approuague and Oyapock River drainages. In its natural environment, the species {{typically}} occurs in slow-moving white-water habitats, and has been observed sheltering under submerged branches. Feral populations also occur in China, northern Australia, and Florida, USA as a byproduct of the ornamental fish trade. The species is limited in its distribution by its <b>intolerance</b> of cooler water temperatures, the lower lethal limit for the species is 12.9°C (55.22°F).|$|E
5|$|An {{underactive thyroid}} gland results in hypothyroidism. Typical {{symptoms}} are abnormal weight gain, tiredness, constipation, heavy menstrual bleeding, hair loss, cold <b>intolerance,</b> and a slow heart rate. Iodine deficiency {{is the most}} common cause of hypothyroidism worldwide, and the autoimmune disease Hashimoto's thyroiditis {{is the most common}} cause in the developed world. Other causes include congenital abnormalities, diseases causing transient inflammation, surgical removal or radioablation of the thyroid, the drugs amiodarone and lithium, amyloidosis, and sarcoidosis. Some forms of hypothyroidism can result in myxedema and severe cases can result in myxedema coma.|$|E

5|$|Aspirin {{should not}} be taken by people who are {{allergic}} to ibuprofen or naproxen, or who have salicylate <b>intolerance</b> or a more generalized drug <b>intolerance</b> to NSAIDs, and caution should be exercised in those with asthma or NSAID-precipitated bronchospasm. Owing to its effect on the stomach lining, manufacturers recommend people with peptic ulcers, mild diabetes, or gastritis seek medical advice before using aspirin. Even if none of these conditions is present, the risk of stomach bleeding is still increased when aspirin is taken with alcohol or warfarin. People with hemophilia or other bleeding tendencies should not take aspirin or other salicylates. Aspirin is known to cause hemolytic anemia in people who have the genetic disease glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase deficiency, particularly in large doses and depending on the severity of the disease. Use of aspirin during dengue fever is not recommended owing to increased bleeding tendency. People with kidney disease, hyperuricemia, or gout should not take aspirin because it inhibits the kidneys' ability to excrete uric acid, thus may exacerbate these conditions. Aspirin {{should not be}} given to children or adolescents to control cold or influenza symptoms, as this has been linked with Reye's syndrome.|$|E

Historiography has long asserted that she was raised in lonely isolation, in an environment of religious superstition, <b>intolerance</b> and conservatism. It has also described Teresa Cristina as a soft and timid character, unlike her ruthless father or her impulsive mother. She has even been depicted as unassertive, and accustomed to be satisfied in whatever circumstances she found herself.|$|E
5|$|God's Choice: The Total World of a Fundamentalist Christian School is a 1986 {{book written}} by Alan Peshkin and {{published}} by the University of Chicago Press.

He describes the K–12 day school's function as a total institution that educates about a singular truth (God's will) and subordination before God. The final chapter is a comparative analysis of the school and other schools, institutions, and social movements, wherein Peshkin concludes that the school is divisive in American society for promoting <b>intolerance</b> towards religious plurality, the very condition that permits the school's existence.|$|E
