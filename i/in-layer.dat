40|$|We use {{ab initio}} density {{functional}} theory {{to study the}} equilibrium geometry and electronic structure of few-layer grey arsenic. In contrast to the bulk structure that is semimetallic, few-layer grey As displays a significant band gap that depends sensitively {{on the number of}} layers, <b>in-layer</b> strain, layer stacking and inter-layer spacing. A metal-semiconductor transition can be introduced by changing the number of layers or the <b>in-layer</b> strain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study was to design an inlayered tablet {{consisting}} of glimepiride core tablet for immediate release to produce immediate therapeutic effect, which was inserted inside the cup of metformin hydrochloride for sustained delivery of metformin hydrochloride. The inner core portion was designed using superdisintegrants for immediate release and the outer cup portion was designed as matrix formulations using polymers such as Hydroxy Propyl Methyl cellulose (HPMC) and Poly vinyl pyrollidine [pvp(k) ] to modulate the drug release. The invitro dissolution kinetics followed Kosmeyrs–Peppas model via a non-fickian type diffusion controlled release mechanism for sustained release. XRPD study reveals that there were no interaction between the drug and polymers used in designing of <b>in-layered</b> tablets. All the rate data (K) were found to be significant at the level of p value ≤ 0. 05 assessed by two tails ANOVA. The in-vitro release profile shows the desired biphasic release behaviour. The glimepiride (in core fraction) was dissolved within 30 mins, where as the metformin hydrochloride (cup fraction) was able to release more than 12 hrs from different formulations and t 1 / 2 were found to be 6. 3 hr, 6. 9 hr and 8. 3 hr from the formulations such as F 1, F 2 and F 3 respectively, which indicate the suitability for patient compliance...|$|R

To correctly describe the dependence of the fundamental band gap on strain, we used the computationally more involved GW quasiparticle approach that is free of parameters and superior to DFT studies, which are known to underestimate gap energies. We find that the band gap depends sensitively on the <b>in-layer</b> strain and even vanishes at compressive strain values exceeding about 2 %, thus suggesting a possible application of black P in strain-controlled infrared devices.

40|$|In this work, {{we present}} the depth-adaptive {{deep neural network}} using a depth map for {{semantic}} segmentation. Typical deep neural networks receive inputs at the predetermined locations regardless of {{the distance from the}} camera. This fixed receptive field presents a challenge to generalize the features of objects at various distances in neural networks. Specifically, the predetermined receptive fields are too small at a short distance, and vice versa. To overcome this challenge, we develop a neural network which is able to adapt the receptive field not only for each layer but also for each neuron at spatial locations. To adjust the receptive field, we propose the adaptive perception neuron and the <b>in-layer</b> multiscale neuron. The adaptive perception neuron is to adjust the receptive field at each spatial location using the corresponding depth information. The <b>in-layer</b> multiscale neuron is to apply the different size of the receptive field at each feature space to learn features at multiple scales. By the combination of these neurons, we propose the three fully convolutional neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed neural networks on the novel hand segmentation dataset for hand-object interaction and publicly available RGB-D dataset for semantic segmentation. The experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods without any additional layers or pre/post-processing...|$|E

40|$|Observation of replica {{bands in}} the ARPES spectra of the {{single-layer}} FeSe on strontium titanate substrate revealed a phonon component among mechanisms behind high Tc superconductivity there. We study {{the interaction of}} the <b>in-layer</b> FeSe electrons with the electric potential of the longitudinal (LO) modes at surface of bulk SrTiO 3. A two-dimensional system of charges at the FeSe/SrTiO 3 interface includes both the itinerant and immobile electrons. The latter significantly change the interface characteristics, increasing screening at the substrate surface and reducing thereby the strength of the electron-LO phonon interactions. In that follows the dielectric constant serves as a free parameter and is found from the ARPES data for the replicas. The two-dimensional Coulomb screening is accounted for in the random phase approximation. It is shown that the model is applicable within the whole range of the parameters typical for current experiments. The estimates allow concluding that the LO-phonon mediated pairing alone cannot account for the temperatures of the superconducting transition Tc in the single-layer FeSe/SrTiO 3 reported in these experiments. This does not exclude that the LO-phonons mechanism can become more significant in the differently and better prepared single layer FeSe films. Available experiments are briefly discussed. Thus far no data exist on the dependence of Tc on the concentration of electrons doped into the <b>in-layer</b> FeSe band...|$|E

Our experiments on real data show that multiforce can keep nodes well aligned across different layers without significantly affecting their internal layouts when the layers have similar or compatible topologies. As a consequence, multiforce enriches the benefits of force-directed layouts by also supporting the identification of topological correspondences between layers. Comment: 9 page...|$|E

40|$|Two models {{exist for}} the orientational {{distribution}} of the long molecular axes in smectic-A liquid crystals: the conventional unimodal distribution and the ?cone-shaped? de Vries distribution. The de Vries hypothesis provides a plausible picture of how, at a molecular level, a first-order Sm-A to Sm-C* transition may occur, especially if {{there is little or}} no concomitant shrinkage of the layer spacing. This work investigates two materials with such transitions: C 7 and TSiKN 65. The azimuthal distribution of <b>in-layer</b> directors is probed using IR and polarized Raman spectroscopy, which allows us to obtain orientational order parameters. In C 7, we observe a discontinuous change in the order parameter, the magnitude of which is small compared with the corresponding change in the <b>in-layer</b> director tilt angle. Assuming that the smectic-A liquid crystal is of the de Vries type, we calculate the required to reproduce the apparent order parameter P 2 app, obtained from IR, by using the true order parameter P 2, obtained from polarized Raman scattering. The results indicate that, for C 7, the tilt angle so calculated is much smaller than that in the Sm-C* angle and hence de Vries behavior may not be the appropriate explanation in this case. Conversely, we find that TSiKN 65 shows a different behavior to C 7, which can be explained in terms of the de Vries concept. Thus, we conclude that either type of distribution may exist in Sm-A phases which undergo a first-order transition to the Sm-C* phase. We also discuss the changes in the smectic layer spacing and the orientational order parameters across the Sm-ASm- C* phase transition, together with changes in birefringence with applied electric field...|$|E

40|$|A {{consistent}} {{explanation of}} the formation of a ring-shaped pattern of exciton luminescence in GaAs/AlGaAs double quantum wells is suggested. The pattern consists of two concentric rings around the laser excitation spot.

Interestingly, one of two causes of this transport might involve self-organized criticality (SOC) that would be the first case of the SOC observation in semiconductor physics.
