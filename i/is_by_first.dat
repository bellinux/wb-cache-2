The Wachowskis wrote episodes one, two, three, seven and eight while Straczynski wrote episodes four, five, six, nine and ten. Then the Wachowskis rewrote Straczynski's scripts and vice versa. Straczynski said {{a good portion of}} the writing was done by just Lana and himself. Straczynski {{believes}} writing with the Wachowskis helped mask each other's weaknesses and also allowed each party to learn from the other. He recognizes action and plot as their biggest strengths but structure as their weakness. On the other hand, he views himself as really good on structure but weak on action. Straczynski said the way he works <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>first</b> developing the entire script in his head, from the first sentence to the last, before sitting down to write it, while the Wachowskis begin by writing the scenes they have already developed, leaving the others they haven't figured out yet for later, while they constantly move the pieces around to see in which way they work best.|$|E

The strategy of the proof <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>first</b> formulating the problem for the more general chiral Potts model.

We avoid genericity arguments and take into account singular curves in the very formulation. The method <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>first</b> endowing mapping spaces from (prestable) algebraic curves into the symplectic manifold with {{the structure of a}} Banach orbifold and then exhibiting the space of stable $J$-curves (``stable maps'') as zero set of a Fredholm section of a Banach orbibundle over this space. The invariants are constructed by pairing with a homology class on the locally compact topological space of stable $J$-curves that is generated as localized Euler class of the section.

40|$|Nonlocal means (NLM) is an {{effective}} denoising method that applies adaptive averaging based on similarity between neighborhoods in the image. An attractive way to both improve and speed-up NLM <b>is</b> <b>by</b> <b>first</b> performing a linear projection of the neighborhood. One particular example is to use principal components analysis (PCA) to perform dimensionality reduction. Here, we derive Stein's unbiased risk estimate (SURE) for NLM with linear projection of the neighborhoods. The SURE can then be used to optimize the parameters by a search algorithm or we can consider a linear expansion of multiple NLMs, each with a fixed parameter set, for which the optimal weights can be found by solving a linear system of equations. The experimental results demonstrate {{the accuracy of the}} SURE and its successful application to tune the parameters for NLM...|$|E
