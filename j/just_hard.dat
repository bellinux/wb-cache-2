25|$|Pandya {{made his}} One Day International (ODI) debut for India against New Zealand on 16 October 2016 at Dharamshala. Hardik {{was taken in}} the ODI squad as strong middle order batsman, for not <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> hitting but also for {{building}} partenership and taking the team to victory in complicated situations. Hardik concentrated a lot on his batting skills acquiring {{the role of a}} perfect batting all rounder. He became the fourth Indian to be named player of the match on ODI debut after Sandeep Patil, Mohit Sharma and K. L. Rahul. In his first ODI innings as a better, he scored 36 runs from 32 balls. On 18 June 2017, in the final of the Champions Trophy at the Oval, he struck a 43-ball 76 in a losing cause, after coming in with India at 54/5 following a top order collapse. Reaching his half-century in 32 deliveries, he broke Adam Gilchrist's record for the fastest to get there in any ICC competition.|$|E
500|$|With {{the film}} languishing in {{development}} hell, producer Bill Gerber from Warner Bros. decided James Dean would work best {{as a television}} movie for Turner Network Television (TNT); both Warners and TNT are owned by Time Warner. Gerber explained the format choice, [...] "It was <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> to find bankable names that the studio would finance a $20 million movie with. And there were marketing problems. He died in a highway accident in 1955 so almost everyone would know {{the outcome of the}} movie. James Dean also isn't that well known by the general movie-going public these days." [...] Actor James Franco was cast into the lead role, and principal photography for James Dean started in June 2000. Filming took place around the Los Angeles area and at the Sony Pictures Studios in Culver City.|$|E
500|$|Ronnie James Dio and Geezer Butler joined Tony Iommi and Cozy Powell {{in autumn}} of 1990 to begin {{working on the}} next Black Sabbath release. While rehearsing in November, Powell {{suffered}} a broken hip when his horse died, falling on the drummer's legs. Unable to complete work on the album, Powell was replaced by former drummer Vinny Appice, reuniting the Mob Rules era line-up, and the band entered the studio with producer Reinhold Mack. The year-long recording process was plagued with problems, primarily stemming from writing tension between Iommi and Dio. Some songs were re-written multiple times. [...] "Dehumanizer took a long time, it was <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> work", Iommi said. [...] "We took too long on it, that album cost us a million dollars, which is bloody ridiculous". Dio later recalled the album as difficult, but worth the effort. [...] "It was something we had to really wring out of ourselves, but I think that's why it works", he said. [...] "Sometimes you need that kind of tension, or else you end up making the Christmas album".|$|E

The school now is known as <b>just</b> <b>Harding</b> University High School.|$|R

500|$|Keenor's {{abilities}} {{were described}} as scant. A 'terrible' shot and unable to reliably run with the ball, his strength lay in {{his commitment to the}} cause and in his uncompromising tackling. Fred Stewart, who coached Keenor for over 15 years at Cardiff City stated [...] "I honestly do not believe the word [...] "beaten" [...] is in his vocabulary." [...] Former team mate, Ernie Curtis said of him: [...] "He was one of the hardest tacklers in the game, some said he was dirty but he was <b>just</b> <b>hard.</b> Nobody took liberties with old Fred... could run all night, he couldn't run with the ball mind you, but he could run all day." [...] Charlie Buchan, captain of the opposing Arsenal side in the 1927 FA Cup final, described Keenor as having [...] "a store of energy (that) seemed inexhaustible in defending his goal". His hard tackling style made him a target for opposition fans, even being assaulted after a match for Crewe Alexandra during the later years of his career after a physical performance against an opposition side angered some of their fans.|$|E
2500|$|In a {{final scene}} Don still {{has one of}} the {{currency}} plates, which the police think was destroyed by the explosion. Sameer was actually loyal to Don; informing the police was part of the plan. The disc Don gave them actually contains the names of the European drug cartel; when they are arrested, Don becomes king of the European underworld and tells Ayesha and Sameer they have no idea how rich they will become. When Ayesha tells him she was afraid he would be caught, he says: [...] "Don ko pakadna mushkil hi nahin, namumkin hai" [...] ("It is not <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> to catch Don, it is impossible.") and the film ends with the song [...] "Dushman Mera".|$|E
2500|$|Brad Keselowski {{held off}} a hard-charging Ryan Newman and Matt Kenseth {{to win the}} GEICO 500. “I can’t believe it,” Keselowski said. “Talladega is such a wild card {{and to be able}} to win here you have to catch breaks and make your own breaks, a little of both. I can’t believe we won at Talladega. This race is the scariest of the three in the bracket. To be able to win here is really a privilege, it really is.” Kyle Busch, Dale Earnhardt, Jr., Kasey Kahne and Jimmie Johnson were the four drivers who were eliminated. [...] "We had a real good car most of the day," [...] Earnhardt said. [...] "Got real loose, kind of shuffled out. ... It's <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> racing. That's the way it goes at the end of these races. We weren't in good position." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{claim that}} Jesus was married also {{undermines}} the theological {{metaphor of the}} Church being the [...] "Bride of Christ" [...] (found {{in the writings of}} the New Testament). Jimmy Akin, director of Apologetics and Evangelization at Catholic Answers, wrote: [...] "This image would never have arisen if there was a Mrs. Jesus living right there in Jerusalem…. We know about [...] because they were honored figures as wives of The Founder, and if Jesus had a wife then (a) we would know about it and (b) the whole Church-as-the-Bride-of-Christ metaphor would never have come into existence." [...] As for a possible [...] "son of Jesus," [...] he noted: [...] "We tend to know about even the daughters of religious founders. Muhammad's daughter Fatima comes to mind. It would be much harder to sneak a forgotten son by the eyes of history…. It's not <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> to sneak sons past because patriarchal cultures focus more on sons; it's also because of this: In traditional societies, the son is looked on as the father's natural successor." ...|$|E
2500|$|Swift previewed {{the track}} on the October 1, 2012 episode of ABC's Good Morning America. The song finds Swift {{playing with the}} idea of colors in {{relation}} to her emotions about a relationship. Before playing the track, Swift explained its meaning: [...] "I wrote this song about the fact that some things are <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> to forget," [...] she said, [...] "because the emotions involved with them were so intense and, to me, intense emotion is red." [...] Swift explained that she decided to name this song as her album title, as its lyrics encompass the entire theme of the project. [...] "Thinking about what that means to me and all the different emotions that are written about on this album – they're all pretty much about the sexy, crazy, insane, intense, semi-toxic relationships that I've experienced in the last two years," [...] I noted. [...] "All those emotions – spanning from intense love, intense frustration, jealousy, confusion – in my mind, all those emotions are red. There's nothing in between; there is nothing beige about any of those feelings." ...|$|E
2500|$|A {{press release}} also {{revealed}} {{she had worked}} with Salaam Remi, something which Love confirmed {{when he said he}} had worked on a song with Remi called [...] "Love Is the Greatest" [...] that he hoped would make the album. Of these recordings, only [...] "Motivation" [...] made the album appearing as song number three, while its Rebel Rock Remix appears on the deluxe edition as track thirteen. In another interview Rowland told the Daily Star that she had spoken to will.i.am about working on the album and was also keen to get Sean [...] "Diddy" [...] Combs on the album. Shondrae 'Bangladesh' Crawford who is best known for producing [...] "Diva" [...] and [...] "Video Phone" [...] by Rowland's ex-bandmate and close friend Beyoncé, revealed to Rap-Up that he had also been in the studio with Rowland. Of the collaborations, Bangladesh said, [...] "the music that we've done is <b>just</b> <b>hard,</b> it's edgy, but it's still sexy, and it's not raunchy ... What I like to do when I go in with artists, I like to recreate and reinvent 'em, even if they didn't need that." [...] Another song recorded for the album was the Brian Kennedy-produced dance song [...] "On and On" [...] which was written by Kennedy, Merritt, Rowland and Robert Allen. [...] "On and On" [...] was used in episode fifteen of the MTV reality TV series The Hills. Both Bangladesh and Kennedy productions are omitted from the album.|$|E

60|$|And {{he was a}} man {{who knew}} how to live alone,--a <b>just,</b> <b>hard,</b> unsympathetic man,--of whom his {{neighbours}} said, with something of implied reproach, that he bore up strangely when he lost his wife and girls. This they said, because he was to be seen riding about the country, and because he was to be heard talking to the farmers and labourers as though nothing special had happened to him. It was rumoured of him, too, that he was as constant with his books as before; and he had been a man always constant with his books; and also that he had never been seen to shed a tear, or been heard to speak of those who had been taken from him.|$|E
60|$|The simplest, {{and one of}} {{the most}} {{abundant}} kinds, is a very compact, heavy, greenish-black rock, having an angular, irregular fracture, with some points <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> enough to scratch glass, and infusible. This variety passes into others of paler green tints, less hard, but with a more crystalline fracture, and translucent on their edges; and these are fusible into a green enamel. Several other varieties are chiefly characterised by containing innumerable threads of dark-green serpentine, and by having calcareous matter in their interstices. These rocks have an obscure, concretionary structure, and are full of variously coloured angular pseudo fragments. These angular pseudo fragments consist of the first-described dark green rock, of a brown softer kind, of serpentine, and of a yellowish harsh stone, which, perhaps, is related to serpentine rock. There are other vesicular, calcareo-ferruginous, soft stones. There is no distinct stratification, but parts are imperfectly laminated; and the whole abounds with innumerable veins, and vein-like masses, both small and large. Of these vein-like masses, some calcareous ones, which contain minute fragments of shells, are clearly of subsequent origin to the others.|$|E

60|$|The site of Equator City--we named {{our city}} for the schooner--was soon chosen. The {{immediate}} shores of the lagoon are windy and blinding; Tembinok' himself is glad to grope blue-spectacled on his terrace; and we fled the neighbourhood of the red conjunctiva, the suppurating eyeball, and the beggar who pursues and beseeches the passing foreigner for eye wash. Behind the town the country is diversified; here open, sandy, uneven, and dotted with dwarfish palms; here cut up with taro trenches, deep and shallow, and, according {{to the growth of}} the plants, presenting now the appearance of a sandy tannery, now of an alleyed and green garden. A path leads towards the sea, mounting abruptly to the main level of the island--twenty or even thirty feet, although Findlay gives five; and <b>just</b> <b>hard</b> by the top of the rise, where the coco-palms begin to be well grown, we found a grove of pandanus, and a piece of soil pleasantly covered with green underbush.
