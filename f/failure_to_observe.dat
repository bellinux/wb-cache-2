25|$|Pratyakṣa (प्रत्यक्षाय), perception, is of two types: {{external}} - that {{arising from}} the interaction of five senses and worldly objects, and internal - perception of inner sense, the mind. Advaita postulates four pre-requisites for correct perception: 1) Indriyarthasannikarsa (direct experience by one's sensory organ(s) with the object, whatever is being studied), 2) Avyapadesya (non-verbal; correct perception is not through hearsay, according to ancient Indian scholars, where one's sensory organ relies on accepting or rejecting someone else's perception), 3) Avyabhicara (does not wander; correct perception does not change, nor is it the result of deception because one's sensory organ or means of observation is drifting, defective, suspect) and 4) Vyavasayatmaka (definite; correct perception excludes judgments of doubt, either because of one's <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> all the details, or because one is mixing inference with observation and observing what one wants to observe, or not observing what one {{does not want to}} observe). The internal perception concepts included pratibha (intuition), samanyalaksanapratyaksa (a form of induction from perceived specifics to a universal), and jnanalaksanapratyaksa (a form of perception of prior processes and previous states of a 'topic of study' by observing its current state).|$|E
25|$|The Standard Model {{contains}} {{at least}} three sources of CP violation. The first of these, involving the Cabibbo–Kobayashi–Maskawa matrix in the quark sector, has been observed experimentally and can only account for {{a small portion of}} the CP violation required to explain the matter-antimatter asymmetry. The strong interaction should also violate CP, in principle, but the <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> the electric dipole moment of the neutron in experiments suggests that any CP violation in the strong sector is also too small to account for the necessary CP violation in the early universe. The third source of CP violation is the Pontecorvo–Maki–Nakagawa–Sakata matrix in the lepton sector. The current long-baseline neutrino oscillation experiments, T2K and NOνA, may be able to find evidence of CP violation over a small fraction of possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase while the proposed next-generation experiments, Hyper-Kamiokande and DUNE, will be sensitive enough to definitively observe CP violation over a relatively large fraction of possible values of the Dirac phase. Further into the future, a neutrino factory could be sensitive to nearly all possible values of the CP violating Dirac phase. If neutrinos are Majorana fermions, the PMNS matrix could have two additional CP violating Majorana phases, leading to a fourth source of CP violation within the Standard Model. The experimental evidence for Majorana neutrinos would be the observation of neutrinoless double-beta decay. The best limits come from the GERDA experiment. CP violation in the lepton sector generates a matter-antimatter asymmetry through a process called leptogenesis. This could become the preferred explanation in the Standard Model for the matter-antimatter asymmetry of the universe once CP violation is experimentally confirmed in the lepton sector.|$|E

This finding suggests that previous <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> reliable interference induced by context pictures {{may be due to}} the weakness of lexical activation and competition induced by pictures, relative to words. The production of both picture names within one integrated compound word clearly enhances lexical activation, resulting in measurable interference effects.

25|$|Iran {{went from}} banning {{all types of}} veils in 1936 to {{restoring}} original dress code between 1980 and 1984. Practical decisions started with the Iranian Cultural Revolution in April 1980, when {{it was decided that}} women in government offices and educational institutions would observe the veil. The 1983 penal code prescribed punishment of 74 lashes for women appearing in public without Islamic hijab (hijab shar'ee), leaving the definition of proper hijab ambiguous. The same period witnessed tensions around the definition of proper hijab, which sometimes resulted in vigilante harassment of women who were perceived to wear improper clothing. The government felt obliged to address this situation, and in 1984 Tehran’s public prosecutor announced that a stricter dress-code should observed in public establishments, while clothing in other places should correspond to standards observed by the majority of the people. A new regulation issued in 1988 by the Ministry of the Interior based on the 1983 law further specified what constituted violations of hijab. Iran's current penal code stipulates a fine or 10 days to two months in prison as punishment for <b>failure</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> hijab in public, without specifying its form. The dress code has been subject of alternating periods of relatively strict and relaxed enforcement over the years, with many women pushing its boundaries, and its compulsory aspect has been a point of contention between conservatives and the current president Hassan Rouhani. In governmental and religious institutions, the dress code requires khimar-type headscarf and overcoat, while in other public places women commonly wear a loosely tied headscarf (rousari). Iranian government endorses and officially promotes stricter types of veiling, praising it by invoking both Islamic religious principles and pre-Islamic Iranian culture.|$|E

40|$|With the {{discovery}} of the blocking effect, learning theory took a huge leap forward, because blocking provided a crucial clue that surprise is what drives learning. This in turn stimulated the development of novel association-formation theories of learning. Eventually, the ability to explain blocking became nothing short of a touchstone for the validity of any theory of learning, including propositional and other nonassociative theories. The abundance of publications reporting a blocking effect and the importance attributed to it suggest that it is a robust phenomenon. Yet, in the current article we report 15 <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> a blocking effect despite the use of procedures that are highly similar or identical to those used in published studies. Those failures raise doubts regarding the canonical nature of the blocking effect and call for a reevaluation of the central status of blocking in theories of learning.

40|$|Despite {{extensive}} {{evidence that}} appetitive memories undergo reconsolidation, two notable <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> reconsolidation have been reported: instrumental responding and goal-tracking. However, these studies {{do not provide}} conclusive evidence {{for a lack of}} memory reconsolidation due to the numerous boundary conditions that dictate whether a memory will undergo reconsolidation. In this study we sought to reexamine reconsolidation in an appetitive, Pavlovian conditioned approach procedure and the behavioral boundary conditions within which memories are destabilized and reconsolidated. This study demonstrated that a Pavlovian goal-tracking memory, previously thought to be resistant to destabilization, will undergo memory reconsolidation under discrete conditions that favor reconsolidation as opposed to extinction, and that this is dependent on the amount of training rats received. With restricted training, systemic administration of MK- 801 impaired memory extinction. In contrast, with more extended training, MK- 801 administration impaired memory reconsolidation. We also demonstrate that behavioral boundary conditions that exist for appetitive memory reconsolidation are much more complex than simple parametric calculations. Moreover, extinction per se is not a boundary on reconsolidation, in that MK- 801 also has no behavioral effect under some conditions...|$|R
40|$|This CPB Document {{provides}} a framework {{for the evaluation of}} non-profit organisations. This framework addresses the question under which conditions, and, if so, in what way non-profits should be stimulated. Essentially, in order to answer these questions, three steps can be followed: (i) identifying potentially relevant market failures that non-profits may aim to diminish; (ii) linking market <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>observed</b> performance indicators for profits and non-profits; and (iii) use these insights to derive policy implications: should non-profits be stimulated? We apply the proposed framework to three sectors that are commonly labelled as 'social services': the care sector, the childcare sector and welfare-to-work services. All these sectors are subject to substantial informational problems regarding the quality of services. When surveying the literature, we find non-profit organisations only {{to make a difference in}} some specific cases. So far, there is no strong evidence that can be used as an argument to stimulate non-profit organisations in mixed markets. Moreover, such (targeted) policies may discourage donated labour and private donations, thus rendering them largely ineffective. ...|$|R
40|$|Issues in the {{detection}} {{and interpretation of}} interaction effects between quantitative variables in multiple regression analysis are discussed.

40|$|A {{consistent}} finding {{observed in}} many contingency learning experiments is that people’s {{estimation of the}} strength of a cause-effect relation is systematically biased by a number of variables, such as the relative frequencies of the cause and the effect. Some studies have found, however, that these latter biases are highly dependent on the procedure used to assess participants’ perception of the contingency: Specifically, these effects tend to occur more often when participants are requested a causal or contingency rating that when their contingency perception is inferred from their actual, trial-by-trial predictive behavior. This result has been taken as evidence for the higher complexity of the cognitive processes underlying causal or contingency judgments, relative to those involved in outcome prediction. Our experiments show, however, that the cue-density bias can be observed even when a predictive judgment is used as a dependent variable. This suggests that previous <b>failures</b> <b>to</b> <b>observe</b> biases with predictive trial-by-trial responses might not have been due to their predictive nature but to the specific response format and the moment in which these measures were collected (during training or after training) in those experiments. status: publishe...|$|R

The anchoring theory of lightness (Gilchrist et al, 1999 Psychological Review 106 795 - 834) assumes that the highest luminance is perceived as white, and the appearance of all the other regions depends on their relationship to such white. It is thus a crucial prediction of the theory that equal regions representing luminance increments relative to their surrounds shall be perceived as identical. Our stimuli were incremental targets on two uniform surrounds placed side by side. We used the method of adjustment: observers varied the luminance of the test patch (set on a black surround) to match the achromatic colour of the comparison patch (set on a variable surround).
