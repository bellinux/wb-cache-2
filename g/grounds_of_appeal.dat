25|$|On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided {{unanimously}} {{to reject}} a submission by the Crown Office {{to the effect}} that the scope of Megrahi's second appeal should be limited to the specific <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the defence}} team's main <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> {{was that the}} single {{particle}} of gunshot residue in the coat pocket was not evidence which conclusively linked George to the crime scene; it could have appeared {{as a result of}} contamination of the coat when it was placed on a mannequin to be photographed as police evidence.|$|E
25|$|On January 7, 2008, the Attorney General {{filed an}} appeal in the British Columbia Court of Appeal, against Pickton's acquittals on the first-degree murder charges. The <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> relate {{to a number}} of evidentiary rulings made by the trial judge, certain aspects of the trial judge’s jury instructions, and the ruling to sever the six charges Pickton was tried on from the {{remaining}} twenty.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>Appeals</b> Chamber <b>of</b> the ICTY {{accepted}} appeals {{from both}} Martić and the Prosecutor. The Defense requested {{a finding of}} not guilty or a re-trial {{on the basis of}} alleged errors of law and fact. The Prosecution presented one <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> asking for a revision of the sentence due to an alleged error <b>of</b> law. <b>Appeals</b> hearings took place on 25-26 June 2008. The Appeals Chamber dismissed nine <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> Martić’s <b>appeal</b> and accepted two sub-grounds <b>of</b> the fifth <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> reversing Martić’s convictions relating to specific alleged crimes committed in Benkovac, Cerovljani, Vukovići, and Poljanak.|$|R
5000|$|Under this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> Delrina Corp. {{argued that}} the trial judge erroneously limited the {{definition}} of [...] "copying". It claimed that the trial judge's definition only included that which was copied directly from Sysview and excluded copying from memory.At the Ontario Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal,</b> Morden J.A. (speaking for the court) confirmed that copying from memory {{must be part of}} the definition, but nevertheless rejected this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> Considering the trial decision as a whole, Morden J.A. held that the essential findings were not based on the erroneous definition of [...] "copying" [...] and therefore did not warrant overturning the decision.|$|R
5000|$|The second <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> {{was whether}} terms [...] "danger to the {{security}} of Canada" [...] and [...] "terrorism" [...] were unconstitutionally vague. The Court held that they were not.|$|R
25|$|The {{pronouncement}} in Wong Kok Chin {{was followed}} in Ng Chee Tiong Tony v. Public Prosecutor (2008), where Justice Lee Seiu Kin {{set aside the}} conviction of the trial judge as he had descended into the arena of the trial and joined the fray. Although the trial judge was entitled to seek clarifications, he had gone beyond that by encroaching into the Public Prosecutor's duty to bring out evidence to prove its case when he had asked the sole witness almost as many questions as the Public Prosecutor. Conversely, in Mohammed Ali bin Johari {{where one of the}} <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> against the appellant's conviction for murder was that the trial judge had engaged in excessive judicial interference, the Court of Appeal held that the trial judge had not descended into the arena as he had not interrupted (let alone cross-examined) counsel or the parties in such a manner as to give rise to prejudice or the appearance of prejudice to either party. Neither had it been suggested that the judge was guilty of any of these proscribed actions.|$|E
25|$|The Court of Appeal only hears appeals from {{decisions}} of the High Court made when the latter is exercising original criminal jurisdiction. In other words, matters heard by the High Court on appeal from the State Courts cannot be further appealed to the Court of Appeal, though questions of law may be reserved for determination by the Court (see below). A person convicted in the High Court can appeal against the conviction, the sentence or both, unless he or she pleaded guilty in which case only an appeal against the extent or legality of the sentence is permitted. In the latter situation, the Court of Appeal may nonetheless permit the person who pleaded guilty to appeal against conviction if it believes that {{this is in the}} interests of justice. The Public Prosecutor may appeal against an acquittal or the sentence imposed on an accused person. The Court is entitled to summarily reject an appeal if the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> do not involve any question of law, the conviction is supportable by the evidence, and {{there is nothing in the}} circumstances of the case which raises a reasonable doubt as to whether the conviction was right or leads the Court to think the sentence should be reduced. The summary rejection of an appeal may only be done upon the unanimous decision of the Judges of Appeal.|$|E

5000|$|The {{prospects}} for Wallace's appeal were not good, however. Never before had the Court <b>of</b> Criminal <b>Appeal</b> overturned a conviction in a capital {{case on the}} ground that the verdict was [...] "unreasonable...having regard to the evidence", and that was the only realistic <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> available to Wallace.|$|R
2500|$|On 14 March 2002 it took Lord Cullen {{less than}} three minutes to deliver the {{decision}} of the High Court of Justiciary. The five judges rejected the appeal, ruling unanimously that [...] "none of the <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> was well-founded", adding [...] "this brings proceedings to an end". The following day, a helicopter took Megrahi from Camp Zeist to continue his life sentence in Barlinnie Prison, Glasgow.|$|E
2500|$|Many reporters {{asked him}} if he would {{petition}} the Chief Justice to appeal the convictions that Judge Squires denied <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> to which Shaik replied that his legal team was considering the matter. [...] The National Prosecuting Authority, as represented by spokesperson Makhosini Nkosi in front of the courthouse, said that it accepted Judge Squires' decision, despite some disappointment. [...] Nkosi also said that [...] "We [...] are satisfied that the judge applied his mind correctly to all the facts. [...] In some cases, we are naturally disappointed, but even then you appreciate the reasons for coming to that decision".|$|E
2500|$|Fraser lodged a note {{of appeal}} against {{conviction}} and sentence to the Court of Criminal Appeal. The appeal was heard by the Lord Justice Clerk (Lord Gill), Lord Osborne and Lord Johnston. It emerged that two police constables had given witness statements to the Crown before the trial {{to the effect that}} they had seen jewellery, including the rings, in the Fraser's house on 28 and 29 April. Fraser's two <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> were that the new evidence had a vital bearing on the jury's verdict, and that its non-disclosure to the defence had cause a miscarriage of justice. However, the court unanimously refused Fraser's appeal on the grounds, that notwithstanding the fresh evidence and the non-disclosure, the strength of the circumstantial evidence against Fraser was so strong that no miscarriage of justice had occurred. ScotHC HCJAC_26] (6 May 2008) ...|$|E
5000|$|Patel then <b>appealed</b> the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal's</b> {{decision}} to the High Court of Australia, and was granted special leave on the <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> that [...] "The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> erred in law in {{finding that the}} convictions of the appellant ... could be supported {{on the basis that}} the appellant had breached a duty under s 288 of the Code. This section did not apply to the offences of which the appellant was convicted".|$|R
5000|$|Delrina Corp. {{contended that}} the trial judge erred by excusing {{similarities}} between Assess and Sysview based irrelevant factors. Two such factors were that: (a) Duncombe deliberately designed Assess {{to be similar to}} Sysview; and (b) Duncombe was the author of both programs. Morden J.A. dismissed this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> based on the following reasoning: ...|$|R
2500|$|Radivoje Miletić - {{found guilty}} of crimes against {{humanity}} and violations of the laws or customs of war, through his participation in a joint criminal enterprise. The chamber also reversed his convictions for persecution and inhumane acts (forcible transfer) as crimes against humanity {{in connection with the}} forcible transfer of the Bosnian Muslim men who crossed the Drina River, fleeing Žepa. It also granted in part his <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> concerning sentencing, recognizing that the trial chamber erred in law by considering his use of authority within the VRS Main Staff as an aggravating circumstance. The chamber also granted the prosecution’s <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> regarding [...] "opportunistic" [...] killings in Potočari, and entered a conviction against Miletić for murder as a violation of the laws or customs of war for these killings. His sentence of 19 years of imprisonment was reduced to 18 years of imprisonment.|$|R
2500|$|On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided {{unanimously}} {{to reject}} a submission by the Crown Office that {{the scope of}} Megrahi's second appeal {{should be limited to}} the specific <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007. On 21 October 2008 Megrahi's lawyer, revealed that his client had been diagnosed with [...] "advanced stage" [...] prostate cancer. Despite the appeals of Jim Swire, that keeping Megrahi behind bars while he battled the disease [...] "would amount to exquisite torture", the High Court ruled on 14 November 2008 that Megrahi should remain in jail while his appeal continued. In an article published on 29 December 2008 award-winning journalist and author, Hugh Miles, described the Lockerbie trial as an historic miscarriage of justice. The article concluded: [...] "If Megrahi didn't do it, who did?" [...] On 31 December 2008, Dr L. De Braeckeleer ended a 174-part series entitled Diary of a Vengeance Foretold. The article alleges that Iran ordered the bombing of Pan Am 103 in revenge for the downing of Iran Air Flight 655.|$|E
2500|$|On 15 October 2008, five Scottish judges decided {{unanimously}} {{to reject}} a submission by the Crown Office {{which sought to}} limit the scope of Megrahi's second appeal to the specific <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> that were identified by the SCCRC in June 2007. In January 2009, it was reported that, although Megrahi's second appeal against conviction was scheduled to begin in April 2009, the hearing could {{last as long as}} 12 months because of the complexity of the case and volume of material to be examined. The second appeal began on 28 April 2009, lasted for one month and was adjourned in May 2009. On 7 July 2009, the court reassembled for a procedural hearing and was told that because of the illness of one of the judges, Lord Wheatley, who was recovering from heart surgery, the final two substantive appeal sessions would run from 2 November to 11 December 2009, and 12 January to 26 February 2010. Megrahi's lawyer Maggie Scott expressed dismay at the delays: [...] "There is a very serious danger that my client will die before the case is determined." ...|$|E
60|$|Of pure unimported strain, however, were Miss Sedgwick and Mrs. Wright (Lavinia D.), {{the next}} {{figures in the}} {{procession}}--the procession that was to wind up indeed with two foreign recruits, small brown snappy Mademoiselle Delavigne, who plied us with the French tongue at home and who had been introduced to us as the niece--or {{could it have been}} the grandniece?--of the celebrated Casimir, and a large Russian lady in an extraordinarily short cape (I like to recall the fashion of short capes) of the same stuff as her dress, and Merovingian sidebraids that seemed to require the royal crown of Frédégonde or Brunéhaut to complete their effect. This final and aggravational representative of the compromising sex looms to my mind's eye, I should add, but as the creature of an hour, in spite of her having been domiciled with us; whereas I think of Mademoiselle Delavigne as flitting in and out on quick, fine, more or less cloth-shod feet of exemplary neatness, the flat-soled feet of Louis Philippe and of the female figures in those volumes of Gavarni then actual, then contemporaneous, which were kept in a piece of furniture that stood between the front-parlour windows in Fourteenth Street, together with a set of Béranger enriched by steel engravings to the strange imagery of which I so wonderingly responded that all other art of illustration, ever since, has been for me comparatively weak and cold. These volumes and the tall entrancing folios of Nash's lithographed Mansions of England in the Olden Time formed a store lending itself particularly to distribution on the drawingroom carpet, with concomitant pressure to the same surface of the small student's stomach and relieving agitation of his backward heels. I make out that it had decidedly been given to Mlle. Delavigne to represent to my first perception personal France; she was, besides not being at all pink or shy, oval and fluent and mistress somehow of the step--the step of levity that involved a whisk of her short skirts; there she was, to the life, on the page of Gavarni, attesting its reality, and there again did that page in return (I speak not of course of the unplumbed depths of the appended text) attest her own felicity. I was later on to feel--that is I was to learn--how many impressions and appearances, how large a sense of things, her type and tone prefigured. The evanescence of the large Russian lady, whom I think of as rather rank, I can't express it otherwise, may have been owing to some question of the purity of her accent in French; it was one of her attributes and her <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> to us that she had come straight from Siberia, and it is distinct to me that the purity was challenged by a friend of the house, and without--pathetically enough!--provoking the only answer, the plea that the missing Atticism would have been wasted on young barbarians. The Siberian note, on our inmate's part, may perhaps have been the least of her incongruities; she was above all too big for a little job, towered over us doubtless too heroically; and her proportions hover but to lose themselves--with the successors to her function awaiting us a little longer.|$|E
5000|$|She {{appealed to}} the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> on the <b>grounds,</b> inter alia, that since she {{acquired}} a perfectly valid gift, there could not be an appropriation. The Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> rejected this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> stating that the fact there has been made a valid gift is irrelevant {{to the question of}} whether there has been an appropriation. Indeed, it held that a gift may be evidence of an appropriation. Rose LJ gave the following reasons: ...|$|R
5000|$|In 2007, Elliott and Blessington {{were granted}} an {{additional}} appeal {{based on a}} staple missing from their files. Essentially, it was argued, because the Crown indictment was not stapled to the court file, it was not [...] "fixed" [...] to the court file as required by law and the judgement was therefore not technically finalised. [...] The High Court of Australia subsequently rejected this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{tradition}} of the Chief Justice frequently appearing in the Court <b>of</b> Criminal <b>Appeal</b> was continued under Gleeson's tenure. In this role, he appeared as a judge in R v Birks, where it was found a trial counsel's proved incompetence was a <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> and Attorney-General (NSW) v Milat, where an indigent accused {{was found to be}} entitled to legal representation as a basic requirement of fairness in a serious legal trial.|$|R

25|$|Shankar also appealed on {{the ground}} that the Disciplinary Committee, by virtue of its {{excessive}} intervention in the case, had descended into the arena and adopted an inquisitorial role, which had impaired its judgment and ability to properly evaluate and weigh the evidence. In addressing this submission, Judicial Commissioner Menon noted that this was a wholly separate <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal,</b> although it often overlaps with the issue of apparent bias and courts do not always distinguish the two.|$|R
50|$|The BBC appealed {{against the}} {{decision}} of the Information Tribunal to the High Court on two grounds: that the Information Tribunal did not have jurisdiction to hear an appeal from the Information Commissioner in this case and that even if did its decision was flawed as a matter of law. The High Court decided that the Tribunal did lack jurisdiction and rejected Mr Sugar's challenge to the Commissioner's decision. The High Court did not consider the BBC's second <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b> Mr Sugar's appeal to the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> against the High Court's decision on the jurisdiction question was dismissed but his subsequent appeal to the House of Lords (then the highest court in the UK) was allowed by 3 votes to 2 on 11 February 2009. Thus the Tribunal's decision in Mr Sugar's favour was reinstated. The BBC retained its second <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> and the case returned to the High Court on 2 October 2009, when Mr Justice Irwin ruled in the BBC's favour. His decision was that the information requested was held 'significantly' for the purposes of journalism and therefore was exempt under the Freedom of Information Act. On 23 June 2010, at the Court <b>of</b> <b>Appeal</b> the Master <b>of</b> the Rolls, Lord Neuberger, Lord Justice Moses and Lord Justice Munby upheld that decision and rejected Mr Sugar's appeal.|$|R
50|$|In {{this case}} the trial judge found that copying of Sysview was not {{the source of the}} {{similarities}} between the two programs. Many similarities were commanded by Hewlett Packard's operating system and others could be attributed to common programming practices. Though the trial judge may have alluded to some American authorities, his analysis did not deny Delrina Corp. the benefit of the broader copyright protection afforded by the Canadian system. There was no denial of copyright protection to ideas reflecting skill and labour, which would attract protection under the Canadian application of the idea/expression dichotomy. Morden J.A. consequently rejected this <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal.</b>|$|R
5000|$|On 31 January 2014 the Lewison LJ granted {{leave to}} appeal, stating ‘The <b>grounds</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> raise an {{important}} point of principle which, as the judge said “does not admit to an easy answer”.’ ...|$|E

The Appeals Chamber {{found that it}} was not shown that Boškoskihad failed to take the necessary and reasonable measures to punish his offending subordinates. The Chamber stated that, in the circumstances of the case, it was open to a reasonable trier of fact to acquit Boškoski of failure to punish, on the basis of reports about the events described in the indictment which had been provided by the Ministry of Interior to the competent judicial authorities. The Appeals Chamber dismissed the Prosecution's single <b>ground</b> <b>of</b> <b>appeal</b> against Boškoski’s acquittal.|$|R
