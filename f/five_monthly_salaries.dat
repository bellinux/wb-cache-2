It was alleged that Iorga, {{a supporter of}} the new king, asked for Tzigara to be removed from the royal Foundation, but that Carol had stated not being willing to sack [...] "my own uncle." [...] Iorga was however in a position to limit his rival's access to academia when, in 1931, he became Carol II's Prime Minister. His legislative proposal, limiting the number of academic positions an individual could hold, was probably aimed specifically at Tzigara and other personal enemies (as Lucian Nastasă writes, Iorga was himself collecting some <b>five</b> <b>monthly</b> <b>salaries</b> from his work with the state).|$|E
