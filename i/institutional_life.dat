25|$|In {{the colonial}} period, basic {{patterns}} of regional development emerged and strengthened European settlement and <b>institutional</b> <b>life</b> {{was built on}} the Mesoamerican heartland of the Aztec Empire in Central Mexico. The South (Oaxaca, Michoacan, Yucatán, and Central America) was also in the region of dense indigenous settlement of Mesoamerica, but in the absence of exploitable resources of interest to Europeans, the South attracted few Europeans, while the indigenous presence remained strong. The North was outside region of complex indigenous populations, but with the discovery of silver in the region of nomadic and hostile northern indigenous groups, the Spanish sought to conquer or pacify those peoples in order to exploit the mines and develop enterprises to supply them. Since much of northern New Spain attracted few Europeans and had a sparse indigenous population, the Spanish crown and later the Republic of Mexico did not effectively exert sovereignty of the region, leaving it vulnerable to the expansionism of the United States in the nineteenth century.|$|E

2500|$|Converted Jews, {{so-called}} New Christians, many of {{whom were}} merchants, played a role in colonial Brazil. Their [...] "importance in the colonial may be one explanation why the Inquisition was not permanently established in Brazil during the Iberian Union." [...] New Christians were well integrated into <b>institutional</b> <b>life,</b> serving in civil as well as ecclesiatical offices. The relative lack of persecution and abundance of opportunity allowed them to have a significant place in society. [...] With the Iberian Union (1580-1640), many migrated to Spanish America.|$|E
2500|$|Brazil had {{coastal cities}} and towns, {{which have been}} {{considered}} far less important than colonial settlements in Spanish America, but like Spanish America, urban settlements were important as the sites of <b>institutional</b> <b>life</b> of church and state, as well as urban groups of merchants. [...] Unlike many areas of Spanish America, there was no dense, sedentary indigenous population which had already created settlements, but cities and towns in Brazil {{were similar to those}} in Spanish Colonial Venezuela. [...] Port cities allowed Portuguese trade goods to enter, including African slaves, and export goods of sugar and later gold and coffee to be exported to Portugal and beyond. Coastal cities of Olinda (founded 1537), Salvador da Bahia (1549), Santos (1545), Vitória (1551), and Rio de Janeiro (1565) were also vital in the defense against pirates. Only São Paulo in Minas Gerais was an important inland city. [...] Unlike the network of towns and cities that developed in most areas of Spanish America, the coastal cities and their hinterlands were oriented toward Portugal directly with little connection otherwise. [...] With sugar as the major export commodity in the early period and the necessity to process cane into exportable refined sugar on-site, the sugar engenhos had resident artisans and barber-surgeons, and functioned in some ways as small towns. Also unlike most Spanish settlements, Brazilian cities and towns did not have a uniform lay-out of central plaza and a check board pattern of streets, often because the topography defeated such an orderly layout.|$|E

Consistent with what was hypothesised, the empirical results suggest that choice of distribution system is distinguished by organisational form, firm size, and sales commission. However, contrary to expectations, the variables representing product diversity and asset specificity were found not to be statistically significant. The empirical results thus lend mixed support for prior predictions.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the relationship between <b>institutional</b> trust and <b>life</b> satisfaction, and the mediating role of belief in a just world (BJW) among the elderly. The General Belief in a Just World Scale (GBJW) and Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) were employed. A self-developed Institutional Trust questionnaire {{was used to measure}} participant&# 39; levels of trust in eight institutions. The aggregate score for all eight items represented the level of institutional trust. The questionnaires were completed by 19, 352 retirees ranging in age from 50 to 99 (M = 69. 7, SD = 8. 0). The results showed the following: (1) overall, the retirees tended to report high institutional trust and high <b>life</b> satisfaction; (2) <b>institutional</b> trust was positively associated with life satisfaction; and (3) more importantly, the relationships between <b>institutional</b> trust and <b>life</b> satisfaction were partially mediated by GBJW. This finding provides a new insight into the psychological mechanisms by which institutional trust relates to individual happiness. The theoretical and practical implications of these findings, as well as the study&# 39;s limitations, are discussed. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

This study surveys REITs on all facets of their real estate investments. The survey covers real estate portfolio size and type, portfolio composition, investment by property type, international investments, before-tax analysis, after-tax analysis, diversification strategies, computer usage, holding period assumptions and criteria for obtaining mortgages, equity positions, and construction loans. The results of this study are then compared and contrasted with previous studies. ...|$|R
