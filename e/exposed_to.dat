In its culinary use, sugar that is <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> a heat source causes caramelization to take place.

5|$|In 2012, a study {{conducted}} by , UC Davis, US Forest Service, and the Hoopa Tribe showed that fishers in California were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> and killed by anticoagulant rodenticides associated with marijuana cultivation. In this study, 79% of fishers that were tested in California were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an average of 1.61 different anticoagulant rodenticides and four fishers died directly attributed to these toxicants. A 2015 follow-up study building on this data determined that the trend of exposure and mortality from these toxicants increased to 85%, that California fishers were now <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an average of 1.73 different anticoagulant rodenticides, and that nine more fishers died, bringing the total to 13. The extent of marijuana cultivation within fishers' home ranges was highlighted in a 2013 study focusing on fisher survival and impacts from marijuana cultivation within the Sierra National Forest. Research showed that fishers had an average of 5.3 individual grow sites within their home range. One fisher had 16 individual grow sites within its territory.|$|E

5|$|Males {{must first}} wait to sense a female’s pheromones {{before they can}} locate her. Before males engage in flight to find a female, they warm-up by {{shivering}} the major flight muscles to reach thoracic temperature optimal to sustain flight, around 26 degrees Celsius. The thermoregulatory shivering activities of males were measured as they were <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> different sex-related olfactory cues. Males are found to heat up more quickly {{in the presence of}} a female pheromone and take-off at a lower thoracic temperature than males who are <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> other chemical scents. Since heating up to the right temperature leads to better flight performance than flying immediately, there is a trade-off between sub-optimal flight performance and rapid onset of directed flight. Helicoverpa zea males <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> an attractive pheromone blend thus spend less time shivering and increase their heating rate. Thermoregulatory behavior of unrestrained moths is associated with competition for access to females, showing the ecological trade-off.|$|E

Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some {{studies have shown that}} the risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E

5|$|Plutonium is a {{transuranic}} radioactive {{chemical element}} with symbol Pu and atomic number 94. It is an actinide metal of silvery-gray appearance that tarnishes when <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> air, and forms a dull coating when oxidized. The element normally exhibits six allotropes and four oxidation states. It reacts with carbon, halogens, nitrogen, silicon and hydrogen. When <b>exposed</b> <b>to</b> moist air, it forms oxides and hydrides that can expand the sample up to 70% in volume, {{which in turn}} flake off as a powder that is pyrophoric. It is radioactive and can accumulate in bones, which makes the handling of plutonium dangerous.|$|E
