5|$|Disulfiram (Antabuse) {{prevents}} {{the elimination of}} acetaldehyde, a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of many hangover symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is severe discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover. This discourages an alcoholic from drinking in significant amounts while they take the medicine.|$|E

5|$|Robert Koch, {{a pioneer}} in medical microbiology, worked on cholera, anthrax and tuberculosis. In his {{research}} into tuberculosis Koch finally proved the germ theory, for which he received a Nobel Prize in 1905.

It may also be formed from the reaction of hydrogen sulfide with silver metal or aqueous Ag+ ions. Many non-stoichiometric selenides and tellurides are known; in particular, AgTe~3 is a low-temperature superconductor.|$|E

50|$|Thierry's {{explanation}} {{of the creation of}} <b>the</b> world <b>is</b> based on a theological interpretation of Aristotle's four causes, which he identifies with the three persons of the Trinity plus matter (made up of the four elements): <b>the</b> Father <b>is</b> <b>the</b> efficient <b>cause,</b> <b>the</b> Son <b>is</b> <b>the</b> formal <b>cause,</b> <b>the</b> Holy Spirit <b>is</b> <b>the</b> final <b>cause</b> and <b>the</b> four elements <b>are</b> <b>the</b> material <b>cause.</b>|$|R

5|$|Tulsidas {{identifies}} Maya with Sita, the inseparable {{energy of}} Rama which takes avatar along with Rama. In his view, Maya is of two types – Vidya and Avidya. Vidya Maya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> {{of creation and}} the liberation of Jiva. Avidya Maya <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of illusion and bondage of the Jiva. The entire world is {{under the control of}} Maya. Maya is essentially the same but the two divisions are made for cognitive purposes, this view of Tulsidas is in accordance with Vaishnava teachers of Vedanta.|$|E
5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in part due to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E

The practice is more common in some European countries where water fluoridation is not carried out. In France, 35% of the table salt sold contains added sodium fluoride.|$|E
5|$|A white {{cockatoo}} and a sulphur-crested cockatoo {{were found to}} be infected with the protozoon Haemoproteus and another sulphur-crested cockatoo had the malaria parasite Plasmodium on analysis of faecal samples at Almuñecar ornithological garden in Granada in Spain. Like amazon parrots and macaws, cockatoos frequently develop cloacal papillomas. The relationship with malignancy is unknown, as <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause,</b> although a parrot papilloma virus has been isolated from an African grey parrot with the condition.|$|E
5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, disorientation (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E

5|$|Another line of {{research}} involved the biochemistry of the hemoglobin-oxyhemoglobin system. Conant ran a series of experiments with electrochemical oxidation and reduction, {{following in the footsteps}} of the famous German chemist and Nobel laureate Fritz Haber. He determined that the iron centre in methemoglobin is a ferric (FeIII) centre, unlike the ferrous (FeII) centre found in normal hemoglobin, and this difference in oxidation state <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of methemoglobinemia, a medical condition which causes tissue hypoxia.|$|E

5|$|Norovirus is {{the leading}} cause of {{gastroenteritis}} among adults in America, causing greater than 90% of outbreaks. These localized epidemics typically occur when groups of people spend time in close physical proximity to each other, such as on cruise ships, in hospitals, or in restaurants. People may remain infectious even after their diarrhea has ended. Norovirus <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>cause</b> of about 10% of cases in children.|$|E
