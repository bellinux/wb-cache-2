Russia's actions in the First Chechen War were also a motivating factor for several countries that had memories of similar Soviet offensives.|$|E

5|$|After Sim Snuka, {{the son of}} Jimmy Snuka, also {{expressed}} interest <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> the group, Orton made them qualify {{through a series of}} tests which Manu failed the first week.

After the match, Orton explained that since Snuka did not pick up the pinfall, he was out of the group. The following week, Manu and Snuka informed Rhodes that they were intending to assault Orton and had brought someone to help them do so, giving Rhodes an ultimatum to choose a side. When Rhodes refused to side with them, Manu and Snuka brought out a returning Ted DiBiase to aid them, and tried to assault Rhodes and Orton. Instead DiBiase joined The Legacy, attacking Manu and Snuka, and forgiving Orton for attacking him.|$|E

5|$|Ament and Gossard were {{devastated by}} the death of Wood and the {{resulting}} demise of Mother Love Bone. Gossard spent his time afterwards writing material that was harder-edged than what he had been doing previously. After a few months, Gossard started practicing with fellow Seattle guitarist Mike McCready, whose band, Shadow, had broken up; McCready in turn encouraged Gossard to reconnect with Ament. After practicing for a while, the trio sent out a five-song demo tape in order to find a singer and a drummer. They gave former Red Hot Chili Peppers drummer Jack Irons the demo to see if he would be interested <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> the band and to distribute the demo to anyone he felt might fit the lead vocal position.|$|E
5|$|Discontent with Richard's actions {{manifested}} itself in the summer after he {{took control of the}} country, as a conspiracy emerged to displace him from the throne. The rebels were mostly loyalists to Edward IV, who saw Richard as a usurper. Their plans were coordinated by a Lancastrian, Henry's mother Lady Margaret, who was promoting her son as a candidate for the throne. The highest-ranking conspirator was Buckingham. No chronicles tell of the duke's motive <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> the plot, although historian Charles Ross proposes that Buckingham was trying to distance himself from a king who was becoming increasingly unpopular with the people. Michael Jones and Malcolm Underwood suggest that Margaret deceived Buckingham into thinking the rebels supported him to be king.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} part of {{qualifying}} (Q1), Mercedes was able to refrain from using the faster super-soft tyres, nevertheless setting times below 1:16. Fastest in the session was Romain Grosjean, who was narrowly quicker than the Mercedes drivers, but on the softer tyre compound. With Button not participating, four drivers were left to be eliminated. The two Manor drivers once more did not make the cut and took 18th and 19th on the grid, with Roberto Merhi out-qualifying his teammate Will Stevens {{for the first time in}} a qualifying that both drivers participated <b>in.</b> <b>Joining</b> them on the sidelines were two more prominent drivers: both Sebastian Vettel and Felipe Massa suffered from problems with their power units, finishing 16th and 17th respectively.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{election}} loss Dosanjh returned to practicing law {{and let his}} party membership lapse. There had been speculation dating back to October 2002 that Dosanjh was interested <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> the Liberal Party of Canada. New Democratic Party leader Jack Layton approached Dosanjh in 2003 {{to see if he}} was interested in running as a federal candidate but Dosanjh refused. In March 2004, with a federal election expected in the spring or summer, Prime Minister Paul Martin approached Dosanjh to be a candidate for the Liberal Party of Canada. Dosanjh agreed and Martin appointed him to Vancouver South over two other nomination candidates while announcing Dosanjh as part of a team of BC star candidates along with economist David Emerson, union leader Dave Haggard, community activist Shirley Chan and Liberal party organizer Bill Cunningham. The advertising of Dosanjh emphasized the party's socially progressive aspect. In the June election Dosanjh won his riding with 44.5% of the vote.|$|E

McLachlan would later sell his stake in Omni, but remains proud of their documentary work.

5|$|In 1877, McGregor {{was invited}} to become a {{committee}} member of Aston Villa, a football club formed three years earlier. He also umpired matches for the club. At the time the club played at Aston Park, close to the premises of McGregor's business. He became interested <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> Villa due to the strong Scottish contingent in the club's ranks, the team's exciting style of play, and the club's connection to a Wesleyan Chapel. He quickly assumed the post of club administrator, helping the impecunious club to survive its financial troubles. After some of Aston Villa's possessions were seized by bailiffs, McGregor allowed the club to use his shop as a store to prevent further seizures. Under McGregor's leadership, Aston Villa won their first trophy, the Birmingham Senior Cup, in 1880, shortly after which McGregor became the club's president.|$|E

He remained in this theatre of operations for the next two years, ultimately serving as the chief quartermaster of the German 9th Army, and was awarded the Iron Cross 2nd Class on 27 January 1917.

5|$|On March 17, 1821, the Maniots (residents of {{the central}} {{peninsula}} on {{the southern part of}} the Peloponnese) declared war on the Ottoman Empire, preceding the rest of Greece <b>in</b> <b>joining</b> the revolution by about a week. The various Greek forces won a quick string of victories. However, disputes broke out amongst the leaders and anarchy ensued. The Ottomans seized this chance and called for reinforcements from Egypt. The reinforcements came under the command of Ibrahim Pasha, the son of the leader of Egypt, Muhammad Ali. With the Greeks in disarray, Ibrahim ravaged the Peloponnese and after a four months siege he captured the city of Missolonghi in April. He then went back to the Peloponnese and turned his attention in June to Mani.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, an {{approach}} has been proposed that makes the processing of <b>join</b> operation <b>in</b> database systems more efficient. <b>In</b> <b>join</b> operation processing relations that take part <b>in</b> the <b>join</b> process are required {{to be transferred to}} the main memory (RAM) from hard disk. <b>In</b> <b>join</b> operation processing when block nested loop algorithm is used to perform join between relations and multiple blocks of the relations that take part <b>in</b> the <b>joining</b> process are transferred from hard disk to main memory than in this case the main memory buffer allotted to the blocks of relation. Using this approach, multiple blocks are transferred for the relations that participates <b>in</b> the <b>join</b> operation processing, instead of transferring blocks one by one for each relation (or multiple blocks for one relation) without worrying about the large and small databases size. When this new approach is applied, the rate of block transfer during join operation processing using block nested loop algorithm get minimizes and join query processing become efficient, without loosing the level of complexity of the previous algorithms of block nested loop join(BNLJ).
