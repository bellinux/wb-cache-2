2500|$|The reconfigured {{platforms}} and new station building, platform awnings and subway at Graceville Railway Station, built between [...] and 1959, demonstrate the principal {{characteristics of a}} suburban railway station embodying Modernist post-World War Two architectural ideas. As part of what was a large suite of similar but individually-designed station structures, Graceville stands out as a significant example of the type, being the first constructed and described {{at the time as}} the most modern in Australia. The Graceville and Chelmer railway stations are the most aesthetically successful examples of the butterfly-roof typology adopted for station building and awning design at that time, utilising new materials and technologies to perform the tasks of sheltering passengers, selling tickets and outfitting rail staff. Through a high degree of intactness, the Graceville station complex maintains the integrity of its original design, and is greatly complemented by the standardised butterfly-roofed platform awnings, also largely intact, that accompany it. Significant elements include the platforms, station building, platform awnings, and subway, and fabric of particular note includes: terrazzo tiles to the waiting room and ticket hall floors, the painted steel balustrade to the stairs leading from the subway, the terrazzo windows sills and the early aluminium <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> sets, the tiles to the subway walls, the timber and concrete seating throughout, the cast iron drinking fountain adjacent to the northern facade of the building, and the lettering on the southern and western facades of the building.|$|E

50|$|The side facade facing St. Antoine {{also has}} five bays: a wide center bay with five pairs of one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms, two {{flanking}} bays with {{three pairs of}} one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms, and two end bays with two pairs of one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms. Brick piers with limestone banding separate the windows. The elevations that do not face the street are red brick with limestone sills, pierced by similar one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
50|$|The gabled second-floor {{ends of the}} {{building}} are covered in wood shingles and feature triple-ganged <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b> The roof's gabled front dormer is finished in wood lap siding, although the actual gable in covered with wood shingles. A pair of <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> are centered {{in the front of}} the dormer, flanked by single <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b> The rear dormer, added after the original construction, sports triple-ganged <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> and wood shingles. The home's roof is covered in asphalt shingles, and features the exposed rafter tails and knee braces.|$|R
25|$|Insulating {{glass is}} an {{evolution}} from older technologies known as <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> and storm <b>windows.</b> Traditional <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> used a single {{pane of glass}} to separate the interior and exterior spaces.|$|R

5000|$|The western {{elevation}} {{features a}} gable with twin two-over two windows inset {{in a wooden}} casing. [...] The gable/pediment is covered in slate. An almost-full, flat-roofed poured concrete rear porch is supported by four square metal posts with plain metal capitals. [...] A one-over-one, <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> {{is set in the}} southern end of the elevation, just off the porch. Two doors open onto the back porch; the northern-most door has leaded glass, the other a single pane. [...] Another one-over-one, <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> at the northern end of the porch finishes the rear elevation. [...] There is a concrete cistern under the north end of the porch that was used to hold rainwater when the home was first built.|$|E
50|$|The {{external}} {{walls of the}} front and side elevations are mostly face brickwork, which is now painted. Outside the verandah, the walls above the upper sill are rendered in roughcast. The front verandah finishes short of each end, leaving a small bay for a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> on each level.|$|E
50|$|Concrete {{and brick}} stairs lead onto the porch, {{the roof of}} which is {{supported}} by six brick columns with decorative arches in between. Large cottage windows with stained glass headers are {{on either side of}} a Craftsman-style front door with a stained glass insert. Part of the porch was enclosed with eight-light casement windows in 1935. The most prominent feature on the structure's left (north) side is a large window bay, sharing the wall with a chimney flanked by three <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> and two more <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> next to a side entry, with a wooden storm door and a wooden paneled door. Sharing the back of the structure with the attached garage, a large enclosed porch sports six <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> and a hipped roof. The left (north) side of the house includes more windows, with a window bay matching the one {{on the right side of}} the house and a set of triple-ganged <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> flanked by two single <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The front facade, facing Kirby Street, {{has five}} bays. The center bay has four piers with {{limestone}} bands and an urn at the top. Each floor has {{a pair of}} one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms. The bay {{to the left of}} the center contains the entrance, with two aluminum and glass doors. Two one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms hang on the second floor, surmounted by a weathered plaque reading [...] "Tushiyah United Hebrew Schools of Detroit." [...] The parapet wall has a brick relief in the center. The bay to the right of the center is identical to the entrance bay, but with two one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms on the first floor in place of the entrance doors. The two end bays have two pairs of one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms on each floor. A classical metal cornice once ran the width of the facade, but has been removed.|$|R
5000|$|The name [...] "hung sash window", {{which is}} more usual in the United States than in the United Kingdom, {{typically}} refers to a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> with two sashes that can {{move up and down}} in the window frame. These windows are commonly found in older buildings in warmer climates, as they promote airflow and are easy to clean. A significant advantage of double-hung windows is that they provide efficient cooling of interiors during warm weather. Opening both the top and bottom of a sash window by equal amounts allows warm air at the top of the room to escape, thus drawing relatively cool air from outside into the room through the bottom opening. A <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> where the upper sash is smaller (shorter) than the lower is termed a cottage window.|$|E
50|$|On {{the north}} (front) and west are porches, some with trim {{reflecting}} its current use. The north porch has a flat roof with ornate frieze supported by pillars. Next {{to it is}} a large <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> with pent-roof top. On the west is a large bay window, supported by sawn wood brackets.|$|E
50|$|Winkler Block (1894-95) This masonry {{building}} is approximately 75 feet wide, consisting of three bays. The most distinctive architectural {{feature of the}} {{building is}} the corner turret. The turret is made of sheet metal and has the turret has five faces, each with a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window,</b> and is capped with a bell-shaped hip roof.|$|E
50|$|Four lancet-arch windows {{lined the}} east and west facades of the Chapel. The <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> had marble sills and louvered, wooden shutters. On the south fa√ßade, two <b>double-hung,</b> lancet-arch <b>windows</b> flanked a semicircular apse {{protruding}} from the building.|$|R
5000|$|... 6420-26 Woodward, c. 1885 This is {{a two-story}} Commercial style {{building}} three bays wide. The entire first floor is clad in square marble tiles {{and the second}} floor of the building is faced in yellow brick. The outside bays have wide second floor windows consisting of a single large light flanked by <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with transoms. The center bay is narrower with just <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The windows {{above the}} second floor are known as [...] "Chicago windows," [...] and are wide window panes {{bracketed}} by narrower <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b> The windows also include {{the name of the}} company below the central pane.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{parapet wall}} has a thin {{rendered}} finish through which brickwork courses are visible. Within the masonry wall are a triangular window {{located at the}} apex of the gabled section and a door and window opening at first floor level contain a sealed timber paneled and glazed door and a tall, rectangular, timber framed, <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> with multi-paned sashes.|$|E
50|$|The {{northern}} {{elevation of}} the ambulance building adjoins the adjacent former ambulance superintendent's residence. This elevation is clad in weatherboards and {{is linked to the}} residence with a timber-framed deck platform. A multi-paned <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> with a timber-framed awning opens from the main volume internally. A recent entry door and temporary screens have been added. This recent work is not considered to be of heritage significance.|$|E
50|$|The {{side walls}} are plain, with {{primarily}} two-over-two double-hung windows. Some {{of the original}} cast iron shutters are still in place. The rear {{is divided into three}} bays, corresponding to the divisions in the front. Each bay contains a center double-door entrance, with a single <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> to the side. The second story contains double-hung windows and several opening onto a wood-floor gallery, now considerably deteriorated.|$|E
5|$|The barn {{features}} extensive windows, somewhat unusual {{outside of}} dairy barns, {{with a total}} of 14 eight-paned, <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> dispersed over three sides of the rectangular structure, north, south and east. On the west side, facing the house, are seven smaller single-pane <b>windows.</b> The <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> are topped with segmented arches constructed from a double row of bricks; the north and south main entrances are also topped with segmented brick arches, each of three rows of bricks.|$|R
50|$|The stone {{structure}} in the back is also rectangular and features a hipped roof. The <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> are the dominant feature of the structure.|$|R
50|$|The roof's front gable, {{clipped in}} the front to form a jerkinhead like the house's other three gables, has a pair of <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> flanked by two small {{triangular}} windows; the gable end is finished in stucco. The gables {{on the left and}} right sides of the roof are built similarly. The rear gable, however, features two <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> flanking a picture window; the picture window replaced a set of French doors opening onto an upper-level porch that was later removed.|$|R
5000|$|A cottage {{window is}} a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> ‚Äî i.e., a window with two sashes sliding up and down, hung with one atop {{the other in}} the same frame ‚Äî in which the upper sash is smaller (shorter) than the lower one. The upper sash often {{contains}} smaller lights divided by muntins (often known as a [...] "divided light pattern" [...] or [...] "grille"), although in some cases both sashes may be divided.|$|E
50|$|The {{front of}} the house {{features}} a wraparound hipped roof open porch, with a turned-baluster railing that spans the entire facade. The opening to the porch is framed by Tuscan columns. One bay of the porch was enclosed in the mid-twentieth century to form a sunroom. The original wood front door isstill on the porch, near a large window. Above the porch is a second-story balcony. The gable above is shingled, and to either side displays a large one-over-one <b>double-hung</b> <b>window.</b>|$|E
50|$|Temporary, {{removable}} screens {{that fit}} within window tracks of double-hung windows {{are a common}} expedient widely available in hardware and home improvement stores. Typically 12 to 30 in high, these screens are wedged beneath the lower sash of a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> and secured laterally by the tracks of the window. A sliding mechanism allows the screen to be adjusted laterally to fit the width of most windows, which also allows the screen to fit securely within the tracks below the open sash.|$|E
50|$|The five-story building, {{designed}} in the Beaux-Arts architectural style and faced with brick, is significant because of its strong use of vertical bays with capping arches. The building is rectangular in plan, measuring 112 feet along Gratiot and 34 feet along Broadway. The street-level storefronts are topped with a stone beltcourse. The middle three floors along the Gratiot facade consist of five, three-story masonry arches with segmental heads. The arches contain recessed Chicago style windows on each floor. The outer bays have two-story round-headed arches trimmed in stone containing recessed <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows,</b> {{and a pair of}} <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> above the arch on the fourth floor. The design of the end bays is repeated twice on the Broadway facade. The fifth floor is separated from the fourth by a stone beltcourse, and contains pairs of <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> above each bay.|$|R
50|$|The {{house was}} built between 1900 and 1901 by Frank Lloyd Wright. This squarish two-story house with a brick-faced first floor has <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> which Mr. Wright usually disdained.|$|R
50|$|A flat porch roof {{formerly}} {{housed a}} promenade, {{as indicated by}} two doors still present today. Inside, the former parlor and ballroom contained tile floors and pressed tin ceilings. The first floor has fixed windows with transoms, while the upper floors bear <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b> All window openings bear stone lintels.|$|R
50|$|The {{southern}} elevation {{includes the}} rest of the wrap-around porch and a protruding three-sided gable-roof topped bay. There is one <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> on the porch facing south; it features a leaded glass pane over a single pane. A door with two large frames of glass is set in the bay opening onto the porch. A double-hung, one-over-one window is set in the southern and southeastern sides of the bay; two more double-hung, one-over-one windows, featuring single leaded-glass panes, are set in the wall west of the bay.|$|E
50|$|The two-story {{section is}} {{topped with a}} steeply pitched asphalt-shingled gable roof. A gable-roof cupola is {{positioned}} near {{the midpoint of the}} ridgeline, and a gable-roof dormer is positioned {{on each side of the}} roof. The cupola and dormers are clad with clapboards. On the front at street level, a shed roof canopy shelters the central entrance, which is flanked by windows. Above is a window on the second floor and another in the gable end.. Each side of the building has a sliding door and a <b>double-hung</b> <b>window,</b> and there is a final window in the rear gable end.|$|E
50|$|At {{first floor}} level, the {{flanking}} bays, originally open porches, have been infilled with timber-framed <b>double-hung</b> <b>window</b> sashes. The floor levels are linked by full height stylised pilasters. The north side elevation steps down from two floor levels at the front, to single storey at the rear, the latter {{relating to the}} lantern-roofed mail room. Each bay contains round-arched window openings, unified by continuous string courses and archivolts. It would appear unlikely that any original fabric from the 1880s side porch in this location remains intact, {{though it may be}} evident at plinth level. Beyond this to the east, a much lower non-original concrete block structure wraps around the northeast corner of the original 1880s wing.|$|E
50|$|The Votruba Block is {{a two-story}} Late Victorian {{commercial}} building with red brick masonry walls, wooden framing, and an iron cornice. It measures 23 feet across and 100 feet in depth. The building has a central-entry storefront {{on the ground}} level, with a narrow staircase at one end accessing the second floor. The second story contains two pairs of <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> with round-arch transoms, and the attic story has a short pair of <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> in the center, flanked by a small round window on either side. A decorative galvanized iron cornice tops {{the facade of the}} building.|$|R
50|$|The {{frontage}} has two doors, apparently separate entrances for {{the shop}} and the residence. These doors each have flush lower panels, a glazed upper panel of six panes, and a glazed fanlight above. The two large <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> are {{either side of the}} southern door indicating this was probably the shop. There are smaller <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows</b> to the sides, including the attic space, some of which are original. The plan is rectangular with four rooms and a central corridor running from the shop to the recent addition at the rear. This addition contains the kitchen, dining and bathroom areas.|$|R
50|$|Two {{separate}} entrances with paneled wooden {{double doors}} are located {{just inside the}} outermost windows of the ground floor underneath the porch. The windows themselves are six-over-six <b>double-hung</b> sash <b>windows</b> in plain wooden surrounds with paneled wooden shutters echoing the doors. On the east facade's first story are similarly treated six-over-six <b>double-hung</b> <b>windows.</b> The western addition has a single similar window but without shutters, as does the northern facade.|$|R
