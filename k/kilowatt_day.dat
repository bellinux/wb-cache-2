5000|$|... 1370 KFRO is a class B station. KFRO is 1 <b>kilowatt</b> <b>day</b> {{non-directional}} (1 tower), 1 kilowatt night directional (3 towers). The KFRO towers are 177 feet tall. The current KFRO transmitter {{building was}} built in 2003. KFRO signed on in 1935 with a 100 watt homemade transmitter. In 1935 KFRO increased its power to 250 watts with a Western Electric transmitter. In 1941 power was increased to 1,000 watts and a new RCA BTA-1D was installed, it stayed in service until 1983, when it {{was replaced by a}} Rockwell Collins 820-D2. The Rockwell Collins transmitter was made to run C-QUAM AM Stereo, which made KFRO the first AM stereo station in East Texas. The Collins-Rockwell was replaced in 2003 with a used 1978 Harris MW-1 solid state transmitter which is still in service.|$|E

50|$|For comparison, the Mars Science Laboratorys {{power system}} is {{composed}} of a Multi-Mission Radioisotope Thermoelectric Generator (MMRTG) produced by Boeing. The MMRTG {{is designed to provide}} 125W of electrical power {{at the start of the}} mission, falling to 100W after 14 years of service. It is used to power the MSLs many systems and instruments. Solar panels were also considered for the MSL, but RTGs provide constant power, regardless of the time of day, and thus the versatility to work in dark environments and high latitudes where solar energy is not readily available. The MSL generates 2.5 <b>kilowatt</b> hours per <b>day,</b> compared to the Mars Exploration Rovers, which can generate about 0.6 <b>kilowatt</b> hours per <b>day.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Frequent machine breakdowns, low plant {{availability}} and increased overtime {{are a great}} threat to a manufacturing plant as they increase operating costs of an industry. The main {{aim of this study}} was to improve Overall Equipment Effectiveness (OEE) at a manufacturing company through the implementation of innovative maintenance strategies. A case study approach was used. The paper focuses on improving the maintenance in a manufacturing set up using an innovative maintenance regime mix to improve overall equipment effectiveness. Interviews, reviewing documentation and historical records, direct and participatory observation were used as data collection methods during the research. Usually production is based on the total kilowatt of motors produced per <b>day.</b> The target <b>kilowatt</b> at 91 % availability is 75 <b>Kilowatts</b> a <b>day.</b> Reduced demand and lack of raw materials particularly imported items are adversely affecting the manufacturing operations. The company had to reset its targets from the usual figure of 250 <b>Kilowatt</b> per <b>day</b> to mere 75 per day due to lower availability of machines as result of breakdowns as well as lack of raw materials. The price reductions and uncertainties as well as general machine breakdowns further lowered production. Some recommendations were given. For instance, employee empowerment in the company will enhance responsibility and authority to improve and totally eliminate the six big losses. If the maintenance department is to realise its proper function in a progressive, innovative industrial society, then its personnel must be continuously trained to meet current needs as well as future requirements. To make the maintenance planning system effective, it is essential to keep track of all the corrective maintenance jobs and preventive maintenance inspections. For large processing plants these cannot be handled manually. It was therefore recommended that the company implement (Computerised Maintenance Management System) CMMS...|$|R

5000|$|After hard work, {{everything}} {{was ready for}} Broadcasting Caracas, as the station was originally called, {{to go on the}} air. Careful tests were performed {{to make sure that all}} the equipment operated fully. Two of these tests had unique importance. [...] One of them, which was held on 9 December 1930 and took place in the Plaza del Teatro Nacional during the dedication of the statue of Henry Clay, was the first remote transmission in Venezuela. That date marked the first broadcast of the new radio station which operated with a transmitter that had the capacity of only 100 <b>kilowatts.</b> The next <b>day,</b> from the ballroom of the La Guaira Country Club, the performances of a band from the North American cruise ship [...] "USS Northampton" [...] was aired in light of their visit to the port city. These broadcasts excited the residents of Caracas and increased the sales of radio appliances. The station began airing more commercial propaganda, which was the intention of its founders.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The HVAC {{systems in}} subway {{stations}} are energy consuming giants, {{each of which}} may consume over 10, 000 <b>Kilowatts</b> per <b>day</b> for cooling and ventilation. To save energy for the HVAC systems, it is critically important to firstly know the “load signatures ” of the HVAC system, i. e., the quantity of heat imported from the outdoor environments and by the passengers respectively in different periods of a day, which will significantly benefit the design of control policies. In this paper, we present a novel sensing and learning approach to identify the load signature of the HVAC system in the subway stations. In particular, sensors and smart meters were deployed to monitor the indoor, outdoor temperatures, and the energy consumptions of the HVAC system in real-time. The number of passengers was counted by the ticket checking system. At the same time, the cooling supply provided by the HVAC system was inferred via the energy consumption logs of the HVAC system. Since the indoor temperature variations are driven by the difference of the loads and the cooling supply, linear regression model was proposed for the load signature, whose coefficients are derived via a proposed algorithm. We collected real sensing data and energy log data from HaiDianHuangZhuang Subway station, which is in line 4 of Beijing from the duration of July 2012 to Sept. 2012. The data {{was used to evaluate}} the coefficients of the regression model. The experiment results show typical variation signatures of the loads from the passengers and from the outdoor environments respectively, which provide important contexts for smart control policies.

2500|$|... the Astros' new {{flagship}} {{radio station}} is KBME, Sportstalk 790AM (a Fox Sports Radio affiliate), leaving KTRH, 740AM after {{a partnership with}} them since 1999 (both stations are owned by iHeartMedia). This change suddenly {{made it difficult for}} listeners outside of Houston itself to hear the Astros, as KTRH runs 50 <b>kilowatts</b> of power <b>day</b> and night, and KBME runs only five kilowatts. As a result, KTRH is audible across much of Central, East, and South Texas, whereas KBME can only be heard in Houston, especially after dark. Milo Hamilton, a veteran voice who was on the call for Hank Aaron's 715th career home run in 1974, retired {{at the end of the}} 2012 season, after broadcasting play-by-play for the Astros since 1985. Dave Raymond and Brett Dolan shared play-by play duty for road games, while Raymond additionally worked as Hamilton's color analyst (while Hamilton called home games only for the past few seasons before his retirement); they were not retained and instead brought in Robert Ford and Steve Sparks to begin broadcasting for the 2013 season.|$|R
40|$|It {{is widely}} {{acknowledged}} within {{the scientific community}} that a single species approach to European mixed fisheries can result in species-specific advice inconsistent with multi-species management objectives. Within the reformed Common Fisheries Policy a move toward mixed fisheries and ecosystem based management is encouraged. The overall objective {{of this research was}} to improve understanding of the complex targeting behaviour undertaken by commercial fishers. Whereby, improved understanding will enhance the ability to predict the responses to future mixed fisheries management measures and changing economic conditions within the Irish fishing industry. Irish métiers (groups of homogeneous fishing trips) highlight the complexity of fishing activities within the Irish fleet, having identified 33 otter trawl métiers and 19 in the remainder of the fleet. Métier dynamics identified over compensation to introduced management, resulting in effort displacement and increased temporal specific fishing pressure. Therefore were deemed as appropriate base units for all subsequent analyses. Two economic variables, operational fishing cost and trip landings value, considered to represent important drivers were developed. This lead to application of a general additive model to estimate and predict fuel consumption estimates according to fleet segment definitions. A linear mixed effects model with random vessel effect was developed as a method of standardising value generating an index of value per unit effort. This identified <b>kilowatt</b> fishing <b>days</b> as the most appropriate effort measure. The final investigation stage successfully amalgamated the knowledge gained into the formulation of novel Markov transition probability for a multinomial model to predict fisher métier strategy choice. This is to be incorporated into management strategy evaluation, aiding the assessment and possible impacts of future management proposals on the Irish fleet and commercial stocks around Ireland. Developments presented will benefit the progression toward optimising sustainability within a mixed fisheries approach to management through incorporation of economic considerations.

40|$|Most {{buildings}} require {{power produced}} by fossil fuels, the extraction {{and consumption of}} which contaminate our environment. The Virginia Center of Basic and Applied Science (CBAS, INC) constructed a building in a remote forested area as a plant and fish nursery (and living space for staff) to be operated by solar electrical power. Comfortable summer interior temperature is facilitated by an open design, 15, 000 cubic foot interior, ceiling fans, many large windows and doors, with a large sun-screen eave off the 1000 square foot south-facing roof. Comfortable winter temperature is possible because the building has no tree-shade, thick well-insulated walls and roof, a low number of air changes per hour, and when necessary the surrounding forest provides wood stove heat. The energy challenge of the research {{was to develop a}} system facilitating 24 -hour and year-round use (primarily for lights, fans, pumps, heaters and staff living requirements) that {{did not need to be}} connected to the local electrical utility company. On average, the facility uses 3 - 4 <b>kilowatt</b> hours per <b>day.</b> The solar power is captured by 8 solar panels which charge a bank of deep-cycle batteries, which in turn generate the power for the facility.

40|$|Many average {{households}} {{across the}} United States {{may not realize}} how much power is saved by simply removing the plug from the receptacle when not being used. A misconception with stand-by/portable chargers is; if a device is not connected to the charger, but the charger is still connected to the wall, then the charger will not consume power. That statement is false. The following report will demonstrate how much power is lost in an average household. When a reference is made to an average house, I will refer to a 4 bedroom single family home. The house will have an average of 2 bathrooms and a garage. I will also test the power quality of the home, where the current is distributed across several frequencies, not just the normal 60 Hz. The project will consist of {{a detailed analysis of}} stand-by home chargers that are left plugged in but are not connected to the device that is meant to charge. Stand-by chargers will include the following but are not limited to: Cell phone chargers, Cordless telephone chargers, MP 3 / IPod chargers, laptop chargers, facial hair trimmers/ shavers, and Television sets that are remotely operated. The study was conducted in the city of Santa Maria California, approximately 30 miles south of Cal Poly San Luis Obispo.

40|$|Hydrogen {{production}} {{represents one}} of the most promising solutions for solving the intermittency in electricity generation that is produced by renewable resources, such as wind. Recent studies have suggested that a potential solution for the storage of excess energy generated by a hybrid energy system is to use a hydrogen fuel cell system operating in parallel with wind turbines (Cotrell and Pratt, 2002; Khan and Iqbal, 2004). This study examined whether a small-scale hybrid system working in parallel with a fuel cell system had reached a commercially viable stage. More specifically, the study investigated under what conditions (wind speed, fuel cell system capital cost, and diesel price) it would be economically feasible to use a wind-hydrogen fuel cell system to replace wind-diesel-battery generated electricity for off-grid applications in remote northern regions of Canada. HOMER (computer software simulation tool) was used to conduct the aforementioned sensitivity analysis as well as for sizing and optimization. The average monthly wind speeds for Iqaluit were used to represent the wind regime potential of a remote northern community. A projected electrical load of 630 <b>kilowatt</b> hours per <b>day</b> with a corresponding peak load of 143 kilowatts was chosen to represent the electrical power requirements of 30 residents for an off-grid small residential development in a remote northern community of Canada. This load requirement was calculated by scaling up, by a factor of 30, the author’s own monthly household electrical consumption of 21 kWH with a peak demand of 4. 76 kilowatts. The analysis revealed that a wind-diesel-battery system is presently the most economically viable solution. However, with a reduction in fuel cell systems (electrolyzer, fuel cells, and hydrogen storage tanks as defined in the Glossary) to approximately 50 % of their current costs these systems begin to become cost effective when coupled with a wind-diesel-battery system. It is not until the fuel cell system costs reduce to 20 % and wind speeds exceed 7. 7 m/s that it is economically justifiable to eliminate the diesel-battery components entirely. Anticipated advances in fuel cell system research and development are needed to enable the fuel cell system technology to become an economically viable option...|$|R
