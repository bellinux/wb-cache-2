6000|$|LADY CHESHIRE. Oh! [Forcing {{herself to}} speak in a casual voice] <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little money, Bill--I {{think it would be}} simpler if---- ...|$|E
6000|$|... "A likely place, isn't it?" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Enfield. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{noticed his}} address; {{he lives in}} some square or other." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{is nothing}} like a good staff to help one along," [...] {{answered}} the stranger; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> an excellent one, as you see." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You didn't put me out, Sir Raffle; <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{business}} {{of my own}} which prevented the possibility of my being here early." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "A likely place, isn't it?" [...] {{returned}} Mr. Enfield. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{noticed his}} address; {{he lives in}} some square or other." ...|$|R
60|$|So I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> wipe {{myself with}} a {{newspaper}} which <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> in my pocket, and a more unsatisfactory thing to dry oneself upon I cannot conceive.|$|R
6000|$|... "Luckily," [...] I said, [...] "I am able {{to arrange}} that. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> money with me." [...] And I took two sovereigns from my pocket.|$|E
6000|$|... "One excuse will {{no doubt}} serve as well as another. The {{difficulty}} is that <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> some idea as to how you got your injuries." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, Pax, go ahead. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{been reading}} {{a good deal}} about things in general of late, so perhaps between us we may grind {{something}} out of a talk." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No,' replied Bernez quietly, 'but as <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> no work <b>to</b> do to-day, I thought I {{would just}} carve a cross on this stone. The holy sign can never come amiss.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] {{answered}} Lisle. [...] "I met {{him quite}} by chance in a Victoria hotel when <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a few weeks}} at my disposal which I thought of spending in the wilds. When he heard that I intended making a trip through {{the northern part of}} the country and suggested that we should go together I was glad to consent." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{even as a}} loan," [...] {{said the}} old woman. [...] "Besides, young man, you must not fancy that I am {{altogether}} penniless. <b>I</b> <b>'appen</b> <b>to</b> <b>'ave</b> shares in an American Railway, which my landlord advised me to buy with my small savings. No doubt, just at present the dividend on the shares of the Washab and Roria Railway have fallen off terribly, but--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Do {{you make}} it a reproach to me that <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a little money? The dearest wish of my heart is to do {{something}} with it for others--for the miserable." ...|$|E
60|$|CLARE. I {{suppose there}} are lots of women who feel as I do, and go on with it; only, you see, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{something}} in me that--comes to an end. Can't endure beyond a certain time, ever.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{a little}} story with a moral to it in my mind, and I will tell it, though it is {{intended}} for younger children than you," [...] answered Rose, who was rather fond of telling instructive tales.|$|E
6000|$|... "Talk about coincidences!" [...] he continued. [...] "Do you {{remember}} last night talking about subjects for cinema plays? I told you {{of a little}} incident <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> noticed on the way from London to Liverpool, about the two men somewhere in Derbyshire whom I had seen approaching a tunnel over a canal--they neither of them came out, you know, {{all the time that}} the train was standing there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{might have}} been a woolly lamb yet, if <b>I</b> hadn't <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{discovered}} that Magic Transformation Word," [...] declared the Wizard.|$|R
60|$|There was {{something}} about him from the first that made me think I knew him, and when {{he took off his}} hat to wipe his head it came to me all of a sudden, he being the exact image of his effigy at Madame Tussaud's, which, by a curious coincidence, <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> visited with a friend that very afternoon. The lady was what some people would call good-looking, and others mightn't.|$|R
6000|$|... "His {{own fault}} if I did. But I like prosperous fellows, {{comfortable}} fellows; fellows that talk comfortably and prosperously, like you. Such fellows are generally honest. And, I say now, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a superfluity in my pocket, and I'll just----" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I'm an American citizen,' said Waterall, 'and <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{some idea}} of a citizen's duties. What is more, I'm a {{newspaper}} man, and I have {{some idea of}} my duty to my paper. Call me what you like, you won't alter that.' ...|$|E
6000|$|Now, {{though my}} master had thought fitt {{to leave town}} without excommunicating with his father {{on the subject of}} his {{intended}} continental tripe, {{as soon as he was}} settled at Balong he roat my Lord Crabbs a letter, of which <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a copy. It ran thus:-- ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Then {{you should}} be more careful, Amy,' {{returned}} her sister. 'If you do such things by accident, {{you should be}} more careful. If <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been born in a peculiar place, and under peculiar circumstances that blunted my knowledge of propriety, I fancy I should think myself bound to consider at every step, [...] "Am I going, ignorantly, to compromise any near and dear relations?" [...] That is what I fancy I should do, if it was my case.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us be reasonable," [...] {{said the}} spy, [...] "and {{let us be}} fair. To show you how mistaken you are, and what an unfounded {{assumption}} yours is, I will lay before you a certificate of Cly's burial, which <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> carried in my pocket-book," [...] with a hurried hand he produced and opened it, [...] "ever since. There it is. Oh, look at it, look at it! You may take it in your hand; it's no forgery." ...|$|R
40|$|In 2001 - 2002, <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> {{proposed}} a new definite integral in the American Mthematical Monthly (AMM),which later {{came to be}} known in my name (Ahmed). In the meantime, this integral has been mentioned in mathematical encyclopedias and dictionaries and further it has also been cited and discussed in several books and journals. In particular, a google search with the key word "Ahmed's Integral" throws up more than 60 listings. Here I present the maiden solution for this integral. Comment: some typos correcte...|$|R
6000|$|... "As to the sword, sire," [...] {{said the}} cutler, [...] "it is an Andrea Ferrara, a fine old blade. By a lucky accident, <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> one {{at home in}} a small {{collection}} of ancient weapons, exactly like it. This evening it shall be at your Majesty's disposal." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I have {{followed}} you to apologise, Miss Therne," [...] he said; [...] "of course I {{had no idea}} who you were and did not wish to hurt your feelings, but <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> strong feelings about vaccination and spoke more roughly than I ought to have done." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'And {{all this}} because <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> enough of good looks {{to make people}} civil to me,' cried Miss Price. 'Persons don't make their own faces, and it's no more my fault if mine {{is a good one}} than it is other people's fault if theirs is a bad one.' ...|$|E
6000|$|One evening, after dining together, as we {{were going}} to the Opera, <b>I</b> [...] <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a spare Opera ticket (as {{subscriber}} to a box), and [...] presented it to Matthews.|$|R
40|$|Note: this {{cover sheet}} is a version that was updated on 3 / 10 / 06 for posting {{on the course}} homepage. Authors: Peter Babinski and David Lin. (The other guide for this lecture is forthcoming.) Some {{additional}} questions for this lecture are below. (Not to say that there’s anything wrong with the questions posed in the attached; these are just some other thoughts <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have.)</b> 1. Recall that with the specific language-model induction method we considered, ranking by query likelihood means that the score of a given document d {{with respect to a}} query q is based on the following...|$|R
60|$|It was on {{this same}} {{occasion}} that Kory-Kory awakened me at the dead hour of night, and {{in a sort of}} transport communicated the intelligence contained in the words “pehee perni” (fish come). As <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> been in a remarkably sound and refreshing slumber, I could not imagine why the information had not been deferred until morning; indeed, I felt very much inclined to fly into a passion and box my valet’s ears; but on second thoughts I got quietly up, and on going outside the house was not a little interested by the moving illumination which I beheld.|$|R
6000|$|... "Nonsense!" [...] said Lady Thompson. [...] "Do {{you think}} I want to rob {{you of your}} {{trinkets}} because <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> given them to you? Keep them, they may be useful one day {{when you have a}} husband and a family and no money. Pearls may pay the butcher and the rent." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know why}} you need be surprised, as such things are very common. <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> taken a share in a loan a little beyond my {{immediate}} means, and therefore want a few hundreds. There is no one I can ask with a better grace than you. If you ain't--afraid about it, just sign it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No Tombey, I don't. Business is business; and if <b>I</b> <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> got to {{windward}} {{of the young}} woman, why, {{so much the better}} for me. She's getting her experience, that's all; and she ain't the first, and won't be the last. But if she goes saying much more about me, I go for her for slander, that's sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I've seen a {{week-end}} cottage near Dorking that I should {{rather like}} to buy," [...] said Miss Mebbin with seeming irrelevance. [...] "Six hundred and eighty, freehold. Quite a bargain, only <b>I</b> don't <b>happen</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> the money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Yes. Sovereign, {{and quite}} ten shillings' worth of silver. Now {{the nature of}} my {{profession}} makes me a suspicious man. It struck me as curious, not to say remarkable, that such a man should have thirty shillings or more about him so late in the week. And then there was another thing. I thought I'd seen this particular man somewhere on the School grounds. Couldn't recall his face exactly, but just {{had a sort of}} general recollection of having seen him before. <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a camera with me. As a matter of fact I had been taking a few photographs of the place. Pretty place, sir.' ...|$|R
60|$|I {{suppose that}} the efforts {{for the benefit of}} the poorer classes in this city might be paralleled by efforts of a similar nature in the other cities of Scotland, {{particularly}} in Edinburgh, where great exertions have been making; but <b>I</b> <b>happened</b> <b>to</b> <b>have</b> a more full account of these in Aberdeen, and so give them as specimens of the whole. I must say, however, that in no city which I visited in Scotland did I see such neatness, order, and thoroughness, as in Aberdeen; and in none did there appear to be more gratifying evidences of prosperity and comfort among that class which one sees along the streets and thoroughfares.|$|R
