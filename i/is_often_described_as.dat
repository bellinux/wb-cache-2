5|$|Devasena <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the {{daughter}} of Indra, {{the king of the}} devas. She is betrothed to Kartikeya by Indra, when he becomes the commander-in-chief of the gods. In south-Indian accounts, Devasena is generally depicted as an antithesis of Valli, her co-wife; together they complete the god. Devasena is generally depicted with Kartikeya and often is also accompanied by Valli.|$|E

5|$|Due to its location, the Church of St Peter <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a {{cemetery}} church. However, scholar Bistra Nikolova considers it improbable that an ordinary village cemetery church {{would have an}} inscription by a Bulgarian tsar. In her opinion, {{it is more likely}} that the church was constructed by a noble person related to the court of the Second Bulgarian Empire.|$|E
5|$|The {{history of}} the Soviet Union from 1964 to 1982, {{referred}} to as the Brezhnev Era, covers the period of Leonid Brezhnev's rule of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR). This period began with high economic growth and soaring prosperity, but gradually significant problems in social, political, and economic areas accumulated, so that the period <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the Era of Stagnation.|$|E
5|$|The most {{distinctive}} feature of Saurolophus is its cranial crest, which {{is present in}} young individuals, but is smaller. It is long and spike-like and projects upward and backward at about a 45° angle, starting from over the eyes. This crest <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> solid, but appears to be solid only at the point, with internal chambers that {{may have had a}} respiratory and/or heat-regulation function.|$|E

5|$|Growing in {{woodland}} among moss, {{plant detritus}} or other habitats, the L.lubrica fruit bodies are typically found in large numbers, though they can grow in tight clumps or even individually. The species feeds as a saprotroph. The youngest fruit bodies {{are small and}} conical, but the fertile head quickly grows from the stalk. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> inedible, despite its common name, but has also been reported as edible and even good. L.lubrica has been recorded in Europe, North America, Asia and Australasia.|$|E
5|$|Matangi <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> an outcaste and impure. Her {{association}} with pollution mainly streams from her relation to outcaste communities, {{considered to be}} polluted in Hindu society. These social groups deal in occupations deemed inauspicious and polluted like collection of waste, meat-processing and working in cremation grounds. In a Nepali context, such groups are collectively called Matangi, who collect waste—including human waste—and other inauspicious things, and often live outside villages. Thus she is associated with death, pollution, inauspiciousness and the periphery of Hindu society.|$|E
5|$|Most generally, State Shinto {{refers to}} any use of Shinto {{practices}} {{incorporated into the}} national ideology during the Meiji period starting in 1868. It <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> any state-supported, Shinto-inspired ideology or practice intended to inspire national integration, unity, and loyalty. State Shinto is also understood {{to refer to the}} state rituals and ideology of Emperor-worship, which was not a traditional emphasis of Shinto — of the 124 Japanese emperors, only 20 have dedicated shrines.|$|E

5|$|The {{earliest}} {{works of}} Japanese literature include the Kojiki and Nihon Shoki chronicles and the Man'yōshū poetry anthology, {{all from the}} 8th century and written in Chinese characters. In the early Heian period, the system of phonograms known as kana (Hiragana and Katakana) was developed. The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter is considered the oldest Japanese narrative. An account of Heian court life is given in The Pillow Book by Sei Shōnagon, while The Tale of Genji by Murasaki Shikibu <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> the world's first novel.|$|E
5|$|The {{island is}} formed of Carboniferous Limestone and <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> geologically a {{continuation}} of the Mendip Hills at Brean Down; however, the dip is at a different angle to that on Brean Down. On Steep Holm the dip is about 30 degrees to the north whereas at Brean Down it is 30 degrees to the south. There are some folds and fractures with dip angles up to 75 degrees created during the final phases of the Variscan orogeny {{near the end of the}} Carboniferous Period, 300million years ago.|$|E
5|$|The jaguar <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> nocturnal, but is more {{specifically}} crepuscular (peak activity around dawn and dusk). Both sexes hunt, but males travel farther each day than females, befitting their larger territories. The jaguar may hunt {{during the day}} if game is available and is a relatively energetic feline, spending as much as 50–60 percent of its time active. The jaguar's elusive nature and the inaccessibility of much of its preferred habitat make it a difficult animal to sight, let alone study.|$|E

5|$|After Pierce died, he mostly {{passed from}} the American consciousness, except {{as one of a}} series of presidents whose {{disastrous}} tenures led to civil war. Pierce's presidency is widely regarded as a failure; he <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> one of the worst presidents in American history. The public placed him third-to-last among his peers in C-SPAN surveys (2000 and 2009). Part of his failure was in allowing a divided Congress to take the initiative, most disastrously with the Kansas–Nebraska Act. Although he did not lead that fight—Senator Douglas did—Pierce paid the cost in damage to his reputation. The failure of Pierce, as president, to secure sectional conciliation helped bring an end to the dominance of the Democratic Party that had started with Jackson, and led to a period of over seventy years when the Republicans mostly controlled national politics.|$|E
5|$|Canada has {{had many}} {{political}} debates between the French speakers and English speakers, {{particularly in the}} province of Quebec. Canada holds both French and English as official languages. The politics in Quebec are largely defined by nationalism as French Québécois wish to gain independence from Canada as a whole, based on ethnic and linguistic boundaries. The main separatist party, Parti Québécois, attempted to gain sovereignty twice (once in 1980 and again in 1995) and failed by a narrow margin of 1.2% in 1995. Since then, in order to remain united, Canada granted Quebec statut particulier, recognizing Quebec as a nation within the united nation of Canada. Canada <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> a cultural mosaic.|$|E
5|$|Conscience is an aptitude, faculty, intuition or {{judgment}} that assists in distinguishing right from wrong. Moral judgment may derive from values or norms (principles and rules). In psychological terms conscience <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> leading {{to feelings of}} remorse when a human commits actions that go against his/her moral values and to feelings of rectitude or integrity when actions conform to such norms. The extent to which conscience informs moral judgment before an action and whether such moral judgments are or should be based in reason has occasioned debate {{through much of the}} history of Western philosophy.|$|E

5|$|Diaby <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being injury-prone. Since {{returning}} from his fractured ankle injury in late 2006, the midfielder has endured persistent niggling injuries that {{have resulted in}} Diaby failing to play a full season for his current club. During his second season at Auxerre, a season {{in which he was}} expected to get some significant playing time, Diaby failed to gain the confidence of manager Jacques Santini primarily due to repetitive injuries he endured during the Autumn portion of the 2005–06 season. After returning to the team, Diaby struggled to return to form, which ultimately resulted in his sale to Arsenal. His highest output for appearances with Arsenal came in the 2009–10 season when he played in 40 matches. Arsenal played a total of 55 competitive matches in the season.|$|E
5|$|Droseraregia <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> being a {{difficult}} species to cultivate, though modern reports on its cultivation have indicated which conditions {{have led to}} success for some. For optimal growth, D.regia appears to require good soil drainage and sufficient light levels, and prefers cooler temperatures. Cool nights and warm days {{have been reported to}} induce vigorous growth. Asexual propagation is frequently achieved through small root cuttings instead of leaf cuttings, which tend to rot before roots can form. Seed germination occurs as early as 10 days to 3 or 4 weeks with fresh seed, faster than many other Drosera species. Germination is phanerocotylar (non-glandular cotyledons exposed, free from seed coverings), with the first true leaves being alternate in arrangement.|$|E
5|$|Numerous works, {{from the}} ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of {{inspiration}} for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She <b>is</b> <b>often</b> <b>described</b> <b>as</b> looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon {{is known as the}} Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.|$|E
