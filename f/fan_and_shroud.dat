50|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, a new custom 4130 chromoly frame helped address {{a lot of}} the visual balance issues and {{accommodated}} solutions to {{a lot of the}} mechanical balance issues. The heat shielding issues were solved and the large polished aluminum radiator was dressed up with a chrome <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud,</b> although some remove the shroud and prefer the more raw and muscular look. The radiator is still the Boss Hoss's weakest aesthetic feature, but there has been vast improvement. The 2006 models dress up the enormous radiator as well as or better than the much smaller radiators of other high-volume manufacturers.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{internal}} combustion engines are cooled by a closed circuit carrying liquid coolant through channels {{in the engine}} block and cylinder head, where the coolant absorbs heat, to a heat exchanger or radiator where the coolant releases heat into the air (or raw water, {{in the case of}} marine engines). Thus, while they are not ultimately cooled by the liquid, because of the liquid-coolant circuit they are known as water-cooled. In contrast, heat generated by an air-cooled engine is released directly into the air. (Direct Cooled Engine) Typically this is facilitated with metal fins covering the outside of the Cylinder Head and cylinders which increase the surface area that air can act on. Air may be force fed {{with the use of a}} <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud</b> to achieve efficient cooling with high volumes of air or simply by natural air flow with well designed and angled fins.|$|E
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 113 - 115). This dissertation {{covers the}} commissioning {{and testing of}} an aircraft's constant frequency alternator as the power supply for the Blue Parrot radar. The Blue Parrot is an X-band radar which forms part of the navigation and weapon-aiming system onboard the Buccaneer S- 50 SAAF aircraft. The radar set uses a source of three-phase power at 400 Hz, which the constant frequency alternator can supply {{with the aid of}} certain auxiliary systems. The auxiliary systems include a prime mover, blower fan and a telemetering system. The prime mover has high starting currents which were reduced significantly by the use of a soft-starter. During testing, the constant frequency alternator started overheating and a blower fan was selected based on its thermal requirements. Significant cooling of the constant frequency alternator's case temperature was achieved by the use of a blower <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud.</b> The generator control unit monitors and regulates all parameters on the unit except for case temperature and blower fan pressure. A telemetering system was designed and built to monitor and display these parameters...|$|E

5000|$|While it {{retained}} the [...] "Bubble Window" [...] styling, it {{differed from the}} Italian model in that its headlamps were fixed separately {{to the sides of}} the bodywork and it carried the BMW badge below the windscreen. The car was also redesigned to take {{a modified version of the}} 250 cc four-stroke engine from the BMW R25/3 motorcycle and the front suspension was changed. The single-cylinder generated [...] at 5800 rpm. The crankcase and cylinder were made of cast iron, the cylinder head of aluminium. However, the head was rotated by 180° compared with the motorcycle engine. The twin-bearing crankshaft was also different in the Isetta power unit, being larger and featuring reinforced bearings. One of the reasons for this was the heavy Dynastart unit which combined the dynamo and self-starter. The fuel mixture was provided by a Bing sliding throttle side draft motorcycle carburetor. In addition to further changes of detail, the BMW engineers enlarged the sump for installation in the car and cooled the engine by means of a radial <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shrouded</b> ducting.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{estimation}} of the performance and stability for a shrouded-fan unmanned rotorcraft whose mission profile also prescribes the flight in ground effect. The not so simple estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients and of the thrust in the various situations makes the performance calculation and the stability analysis difficult tasks. This {{is because of the}} strong interaction between the <b>fan</b> flow <b>and</b> <b>shroud</b> that causes quite different flow structures about the airframe depending on flight conditions. A further difficulty is related to the ground effect which produces substantial modifications in the rotor thrust and aerodynamic coefficients. To evaluate performance and stability, two models have been developed. One determines the aerodynamic coefficients of the shroud, whereas the other one calculates thrust and moment of the rotors system. Both models take into account the mutual interference between <b>fan</b> flow <b>and</b> fuselage and ground effect. Performance and stability are then discussed with reference to significant flight conditions...|$|R
40|$|Mechanical draft {{cooling towers}} are {{designed}} to cool process water via sensible and latent heat transfer to air. Heat and mass transfer take place simultaneously. Heat is transferred as sensible heat due to the temperature difference between liquid and gas phases, and as the latent heat of the water as it evaporates. Mass of water vapor is transferred due {{to the difference between}} the vapor pressure at the air-liquid interface and the partial pressure of water vapor in the bulk of the air. Equations to govern these phenomena are discussed here. The governing equations are solved by taking a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) approach. The purpose of the work is to develop a three-dimensional CFD model to evaluate the flow patterns inside the cooling tower cell driven by cooling fan and wind, considering the cooling fans to be on or off. Two types of the cooling towers are considered here. One is cross-flow type cooling tower located in A-Area, and the other is counterflow type cooling tower located in H-Area. The cooling tower located in A-Area is mechanical draft cooling tower (MDCT) consisting of four compartment cells as shown in Fig. 1. It is 13. 7 m wide, 36. 8 m long, and 9. 4 m high. Each cell has its own cooling <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud</b> without any flow communications between two adjacent cells. There are water distribution decks {{on both sides of the}} fan shroud. The deck floor has an array of about 25 mm size holes through which water droplet falls into the cell region cooled by the ambient air driven by fan and wind, and it is eventually collected in basin area. As shown in Fig. 1, about 0. 15 -m thick drift eliminator allows ambient air to be humidified through the evaporative cooling process without entrainment of water droplets into the shroud exit. The H-Area cooling tower is about 7. 3 m wide, 29. 3 m long, and 9. 0 m high. Each cell has its own cooling <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud,</b> but each of two corner cells has two panels to shield wind at the bottom of the cells. There is some degree of flow communications between adjacent cells through the 9 -in gap at the bottom of the tower cells as shown in Fig. 2. Detailed geometrical dimensions for the H-Area tower configurations are presented in the figure. The model was benchmarked and verified against off-site and on-site test results. The verified model was applied to the investigation of cooling fan and wind effects on water cooling in cells when fans are off and on. This report will discuss the modeling and test results...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{performed}} at Volvo Cars, some concepts of modelling cooling fans with Computational Fluid Dynamics are evaluated {{by comparison with}} experimental data. Focus is set on the method Multiple Reference Frame (MRF) but the Body Force and Mixing Plane Models are also investigated. All measurements were carried out in Volvo Cars component test rig where pressure jump and air flow rate through a cooling <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud</b> mounted on a heat exchanger were measured. In order to make relevant comparisons, a detailed numerical model of the test rig with fan, shroud and heat exchanger were created. A mesh with high node density, in total 14 million tetrahedral elements, was used and the simulations were carried out with the standard k-å turbulence model. The comparisons were performed for different air flow rates, rotational speeds, cooling packages, and for setups with open and closed speed flaps. The Multiple Reference Frame approach reproduces fan performance with good accuracy for most cases. For these cases measured and computed data differ with less than 3. 5 % air flow rate. Moreover, the MRF approach generates good results for open and closed speed flaps {{as well as for}} idle conditions. It also introduces swirl leading to a realistic prediction of the velocity distribution downstream the fan. The MRF method is well suited when doing flow simulations within the engine room and is therefore recommended to use. Furthermore, improvements concerning the procedure to numerically represent heat exchangers {{and the use of the}} Body Force Model are described. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|E
40|$|The University Of Windsor/DaimlerChrysler Fan Test Facility {{is part of}} a {{study to}} develop a {{simplified}} numerical model for predicting the behaviour of automotive cooling fans. The facility could be used to validate computational fluid dynamic software. Three-dimensional velocity vector information is required on planes at specified axial locations downstream from the fan. The facility consists of a 3 m x 3 m x 3 m test chamber, which contains a <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>shroud</b> combination located in the ceiling. The fan is attached to a vertical rotating shaft, which is driven by a variable speed DC motor arrangement. An X-array hot-wire probe is positioned, consecutively, at two downstream locations to determine the 3 components of velocity over the plane. The 2 ̆ 2 ram air 2 ̆ 2 effect is simulated by drawing additional air through the fan using a blower on the exhaust from the test chamber. An orifice plate is used to determine the overall flow rate through the facility. The entire operation is automated using a microcomputer and a multi input/output card. Operating conditions allow for flow rates between 0. 28 m 3 /s and 1. 133 m 3 /s with pressure differences across the fan of less than 2500 Pa. This thesis outlines the development of the physical facility and the associated computer software used to gather data. Sample results are presented in the form of velocity components, velocity magnitude, and volume flow rate versus pressure performance characteristics.

40|$|Theoretical {{aspects of}} a new {{capability}} developed and implemented in NASTRAN level 17. 7 to analyze forced vibration of a cyclic structure rotating about its axis of symmetry are presented. <b>Fans,</b> propellers, <b>and</b> bladed <b>shrouded</b> discs of turbomachines are some examples of such structures.

Steady-state sinusoidal or general periodic loads are specified to represent: (1) the physical loads on various segments of the complete structure, or (2) the circumferential harmonic components of the loads in (1).

2500|$|The {{concept of}} the VAM Pacer was entirely {{different}} compared to the AMC Pacer. The car was focused to be a high-end luxury car from its introduction to its end, while American Motors counterpart started as an economy car and import fighter. This was reinforced after the first 200 units produced when the three-speed automatic transmission joined the standard equipment list, which by default created the addition of an [...] "Automático" [...] emblem on the bright rear panel. The VAM Pacer became the most costly and luxurious VAM car at the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic line. The uniqueness of the model coupled to its level of luxury and price range practically made the car a flagship for the company, {{even though it was}} never officially considered as such. Probably the most unusual aspect of the 1976 VAM Pacer lies in its seat designs. VAM created a design based on AMC's Oleg Cassini interior for the 1974–1975 Matador coupe that used not just in the Pacer but in all three VAM Classic models for the year. The Pacer's seats incorporated a golden Cassini crest on the adjustable headrests and a pattern with copper buttons forming squares. Unlike the AMC Pacer, the VAM Pacer had a very short list of factory optional equipment. These included rear wiper and washer, rear defroster, reading dome light, trunk cover, remote-controlled driver's side mirror, luxury wheel covers and heavy duty cooling system (seven-bladed flexible <b>fan</b> <b>and</b> <b>fan</b> <b>shroud).</b> An universal air conditioning system was available only as a dealership option among a few others not present in the factory list.|$|R

If possible all lines in the manholes except for the line between the manholes are partially blocked. Smoke is created using either a smoke bomb or liquid smoke. Smoke bombs are lit and placed on a grate or in a holder on top of each fan, while liquid smoke is injected into the fan via a heating chamber. The fans create a pressure differential that forces the smoke into the sewer at a pressure just above atmospheric. With properly installed plumbing, the traps will prevent the smoke from entering the house and redirect it out the plumbing vents. Defective plumbing systems or dry traps will allow smoke to enter the inside of the house.The area around the section being tested is searched for smoke plumes.

Commercially produced apparel for green burial was next to impossible to find. Just three makers of green burial clothing were identified through thorough reviews of secondary sources.
