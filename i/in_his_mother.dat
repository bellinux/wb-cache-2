His treatise, Some Rules and Cautions to be Observed and Eschewed in Scottish Prosody, published in 1584 when he was aged 18, was both a poetic manual and a description of the poetic tradition <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> tongue, Scots, to which he applied Renaissance principles. He also made statutory provision to reform and promote the teaching of music, seeing the two in connection. He became patron and member of a loose circle of Scottish Jacobean court poets and musicians, the Castalian Band, which included among others William Fowler and Alexander Montgomerie, the latter being a favourite of the King. By the late 1590s his championing of his native Scottish tradition was to some extent diffused by the prospect of inheriting of the English throne, and some courtier poets who followed the king to London after 1603, such as William Alexander, began to anglicise their written language. James' characteristic role as active literary participant and patron in the Scottish court made him a defining figure for English Renaissance poetry and drama, which would reach a pinnacle of achievement in his reign, but his patronage for the high style in his own Scottish tradition largely became sidelined.|$|E

They translated key Renaissance texts and produced poems using French forms, including sonnets and short sonnets, for narrative, nature description, satire and meditations on love. Later poets that followed in this vein included William Alexander (c. 1567–1640), Alexander Craig (c. 1567–1627) and Robert Ayton (1570–1627).

500|$|Vladek's English {{is broken}} in {{contrast}} with that of Art's more fluent therapist, Paul Pavel, who is also an immigrant and Holocaust survivor. [...] Vladek's knowledge of the language helps him {{several times during the}} story, as when he uses it to meet Anja. He also uses it to befriend a Frenchman, and continues to correspond with him in English after the war. His recounting of the Holocaust, first to American soldiers, then to his son, is never <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> tongue, and English becomes his daily language when he moves to America. [...] His difficulty with his second language is revealed as Art writes his dialogue in broken English; when Vladek is imprisoned he tells Art, [...] "very day we prayed... I was very religious, and it wasn't else to do". [...] Late in the book, Vladek talks of Dachau, saying, [...] "And here... my troubles began", though clearly his troubles had begun long before Dachau.

500|$|Dama {{was born}} 26 May 1954 in Marolambo, near Toamasina. He earned a {{university}} degree in sociology {{and has served}} as a Deputy in the National Assembly. During his first term he represented Antananarivo, later moving to the rural district of Ambatofinandrahana where he was elected for a second term. Dama operates and hosts a local radio station, which serves as one of several fora for his efforts to educate the public on HIV/AIDS and good practice in the agriculture sector and in water management. Dama drew his musical influences from his father, who played guitar and sang the traditional songs of the Malagasy highlands, as well as his mother, who enjoyed writing short stories and articles about daily life in Madagascar. His father also frequently told stories of the 1947 Malagasy uprising, during which time he had been forced to flee and hide in the woods for a six-month period; these stories developed in Dama and Raoul a skepticism toward politicians. Although raised a Catholic, as a child he sang in the local Protestant choir. He began composing lyrics at the age of eleven in French, but soon afterward was drawn to the [...] "musicality" [...] of the Malagasy language and wrote pieces <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> tongue.|$|E
500|$|Visual effects {{supervisor}} James Tichenor approached producer Robert C. Cooper {{after the}} completion of the season 3 finale, [...] "Nemesis", and stated his confidence in his team's ability to create effects for a water-based episode. By that time, Cooper had already written the outline of [...] "Small Victories" [...] as the season 4 opener. [...] "Small Victories" [...] resumes the cliffhanger ending of [...] "Nemesis" [...] and alludes to events of that episode several times. The episode begins aboard a Russian submarine where one Russian says <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> tongue that the noise in the torpedo tube might be caused by [...] "one of the bugs from the other episode", an in-joke that the producers intentionally left without subtitles. Daniel Jackson's appendicitis attack from [...] "Nemesis" [...] is picked up, which was originally based on Michael Shanks' real-life appendicitis attack during the filming of the penultimate season 3 episode. [...] "Small Victories" [...] also continues building the relationship of O'Neill and Carter in mirroring a similar scene from [...] "Nemesis". However, Christopher Judge, who in previous seasons sported a bald-shaven head as the alien Teal'c, returned to the set with a small blond chin beard after the hiatus, as the producers had not allowed his character to have scalp hair (until season 8). Judge shaved off the beard several episodes later after acknowledging its look as silly. The official Showtime website initially caused some confusion by listing Jay Acovone (Kawalsky) as a guest-star in this episode, which later turned out to be untrue.|$|E
500|$|The novel {{begins with}} the fourteen-year-old Norman McGregor {{packaging}} {{a loaf of bread}} for his uncle, the [...] "village wit", – who ironically nicknames him [...] "Beaut" [...] because of his off-putting appearance – <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>mother</b> Nance's Coal Creek bakery (bought with the savings of her late husband/Beaut's father [...] "Cracked" [...] McGregor). [...] Not long after, frustrated by the local miners expecting bread on credit without first settling their debts, Beaut closes the bakery during a miner's strike. That evening, as the now-drunk miners move to ransack the bakery (and assault Beaut), he is saved by a troupe of soldiers marching in formation. After the episode, the bakery remains closed and Nance goes to work at the mining office while Beaut idles about. When Beaut is 18 years old, his mother becomes too ill to work and the young man gets a job as a stableboy. One day, as a prank, his fellow stableboys get Beaut (a teetotaler up to that point) blind drunk with a [...] "horrible mess" [...] made just for that purpose. Having reached a breaking point, Beaut takes the rest of his father's savings and leaves Coal Creek for Chicago on the same evening. He arrives in the City just after the 1893 World's Fair. Despite a shortage of jobs, McGregor easily finds a warehouse job and settles into a routine of work during the day and night school/independent reading at night. One day, in a break from the ordinary, the usually unsocial McGregor gives in to the urging of his neighbor Frank Turner, a barber and amateur violin-maker, and goes to a dance. Despite his aloofness, McGregor meets Edith Carson, a frail, mousy, and somewhat homely milliner/shop owner, with whom he develops a platonic relationship.|$|E
