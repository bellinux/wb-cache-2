5|$|Water is an {{important}} resource for colonies living in dry and arid environments, but sometimes {{it may not be}} available. To counter this, workers are able to extract a significant amount of water from the sand with 2%–4% water content and 4% <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Meat ants are unable to retrieve as much water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> whereas with sand they are able to attain a greater amount of water; however, the soil contains a wide variety of particles, including clay and coarse sand, which causes water to be bound firmly. Ants may retrieve it by digging or directly suck on the soil itself at a low metabolic cost. This may be an evolved response based on tested ants, but no observations show meat ants doing this. Meat ants are known to dig into moist soil to gain access to water or where water has been spilt, either if the site is nearby their nest or far away.|$|E
5|$|Amanita regalis is a {{rare species}} {{typically}} found growing {{on the ground in}} mountainous forests, both deciduous and coniferous. It is a mycorrhizal fungus, and exists in a symbiotic relationship with certain tree species. The system of fine below-ground threads, the mycelium, envelopes the roots of the trees and supplies them with needed minerals, trace elements and water <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> while the tree, in turn, supplies the fungus with food from its own supply, which it produces through photosynthesis. A.regalis has been shown experimentally to form mycorrhiza with birch, Scots pine, Mountain pine, and Norway spruce. Fruit bodies have been reported to grow in fairy rings.|$|E
50|$|The {{effect of}} mulch upon soil {{moisture}} content is complex. Mulch forms a layer between <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and <b>the</b> atmosphere which prevents sunlight <b>from</b> reaching <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> surface, thus reducing evaporation. However, mulch can also prevent water <b>from</b> reaching <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> by absorbing or blocking water from light rains.|$|R

5|$|As {{elevation}} {{continues to}} increase, only the hardiest trees {{remain in the}} forest, which is composed almost exclusively of balsam fir. Most of the understory plants and animals from the upper spruce-fir zone, however, {{can be found in}} this forest. Moisture causes nutrients to be stripped <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and brought to lower elevations, and decomposition takes place at a rate that is too slow to replenish them.|$|E
5|$|Book XI covers {{human beings}}, portents and transformations. Isidore derives human beings (homo) from the Latin for soil (humus), as in Genesis 2:7 {{it says that}} man is made <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> Urine (urina) gets its name either {{from the fact that}} it can burn (urere) the skin or, Isidore hedges, that it is from the kidneys (renes). Femina, meaning woman, comes from femora/femina meaning thighs, as this part of the body shows she is not a man. The Latin for {{buttocks}} is clunis as they are near the large intestine or colon (colum).|$|E
5|$|Not all co-evolved {{interactions}} between species involve conflict. Many cases of mutually beneficial interactions have evolved. For instance, an extreme cooperation exists between {{plants and the}} mycorrhizal fungi that grow on their roots and aid the plant in absorbing nutrients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> This is a reciprocal relationship as the plants provide the fungi with sugars from photosynthesis. Here, the fungi actually grow inside plant cells, allowing them to exchange nutrients with their hosts, while sending signals that suppress the plant immune system.|$|E
40|$|The abiotic {{desorption}} of pp&# 39;-DDT {{from seven}} Chinese soils spiked with pp-DDT {{and the effects}} of oxalate at 0. 001 - 0. 1 M and the root exudates of maize, wheat, and ryegrass were evaluated using batch experiments. Soil organic carbon played a predominant role in the retention of DDT. Oxalate significantly increased the desorption of pp&# 39;-DDT, with the largest increments ranging from 11 % to 54 % for different soils. Oxalate addition also resulted in the increased release of dissolved organic carbon and inorganic ions from soils. Root exudates had similar effects to those of oxalate. Root exudates significantly increased DDT desorption <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils,</b> and <b>the</b> general trend was similar among the plant species studied for all <b>the</b> <b>soils</b> (p > 0. 05). Low molecular weight dissolved organic carbon amendments caused partial dissolution of <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> structure, such as the organo-mineral linkages, resulting in the release of organic carbon and metal ions and thus the subsequent enhanced desorption of DDT <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soils.</b> <b>The</b> enhancing effects of oxalate and root exudates on DDT desorption were influenced by <b>the</b> contents of <b>soil</b> organic carbon and dissolved organic carbon in soils.

5|$|Some plants, {{notably the}} grasses, use indigestible silica (and many plants use other {{relatively}} indigestible {{materials such as}} lignin) to defend themselves against vertebrate and invertebrate herbivores. Plants take up silicon <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> and deposit it in their tissues {{in the form of}} solid silica phytoliths. These mechanically reduce the digestibility of plant tissue, causing rapid wear to vertebrate teeth and insect mandibles, and are effective against herbivores above and below ground.

5|$|Chapter 51 {{provides}} {{a detailed account}} of Ragnarök interspersed with various quotes from Völuspá, while chapters 52 and 53 describe the aftermath of these events. In Chapter 51, High states that the first sign of Ragnarök will be Fimbulwinter, during which time three winters will arrive without a summer, and the sun will be useless. High details that, prior to these winters, three earlier winters will have occurred, marked with great battles throughout the world. During this time, greed will cause brothers to kill brothers, and fathers and sons will suffer from the collapse of kinship bonds. High then quotes stanza 45 of Völuspá. Next, High describes that the wolf will swallow the sun, then his brother will swallow the moon, and mankind will consider the occurrence as a great disaster resulting in much ruin.

5|$|First {{described}} scientifically by Elias Fries in 1818, the {{bay bolete}} was reclassified as Xerocomus badius in 1931, {{and it is}} still listed thus in several sources. Modern molecular phylogenetic studies show Xerocomus to be polyphyletic (not descended from a common ancestor), and the bay bolete is not particularly closely related to species in that genus. Often considered a poor relation of the cep (Boletus edulis), I.badia is nevertheless regarded as a choice edible mushroom by some authors, such as food expert Antonio Carluccio, and is sold in markets in Europe and central Mexico. Its mushrooms are less often infested by maggots than other boletes. Several European studies have demonstrated that the mushroom can bioaccumulate some trace metals <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> such as mercury, cobalt, and nickel. Additionally, the mushroom contains a pigment that concentrates radioactive caesium; specimens collected in Europe following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster had 137Cs concentrations several times greater than those collected before the incident.|$|E
5|$|Like all milk caps, L.volemus forms ectomycorrhizae, {{mutually}} beneficial symbiotic associations with various tree species. In this association, the fungal hyphae grow around {{the root of}} the plant and between its cortical cells, but do not actually penetrate them. The hyphae extend outward into the soil, increasing the surface area for absorption to help the plant absorb nutrients <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil.</b> It is found growing at the base of both coniferous and broad-leaved trees, although it is more common in deciduous woods. It may also sometimes be found in peat moss beds. The fruit bodies, which appear between summer and autumn, are common. They can be found growing solitarily or in groups, and are more abundant in weather that is warm and humid.|$|E

5|$|The common {{blackbird}} is omnivorous, {{eating a}} wide range of insects, earthworms, seeds and berries. It feeds mainly on the ground, running and hopping with a start-stop-start progress. It pulls earthworms <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil,</b> usually finding them by sight, but sometimes by hearing, and roots through leaf litter for other invertebrates. Small amphibians and lizards are occasionally hunted. This species will also perch in bushes to take berries and collect caterpillars and other active insects. Animal prey predominates, and is particularly important during the breeding season, with windfall apples and berries taken more in the autumn and winter. The nature of the fruit taken depends on what is locally available, and frequently includes exotics in gardens.|$|E
5|$|The ectomycorrhizae formed {{between the}} fungus and host plant can be {{influenced}} by soil microorganisms present in the mycorrhizosphere. For example, soil bacteria from the genera Paenibacillus and Burkholderia alter the branching structure of the root, whereas Bacillus species increase root growth and mycorrhizal colonization. The fungus {{does not require a}} specific soil but seems to prefer acidic and nutrient-deficient soil. Suillus luteus produces hydroxamic acid-based siderophores, which are compounds that can chelate iron and extract it <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> in nutrient-poor conditions. Ignacio Chapela and colleagues analysed the carbon uptake of S.luteus in Ecuador, concluding pine plantations accompanied by S.luteus deplete carbon stored in the soil and raising concerns that these might not be a remedy for rising carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere.|$|E
5|$|The fruit bodies can {{bioaccumulate}} {{the toxic}} heavy metal arsenic <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>soil</b> {{in the form}} of the compound methylarsonic acid.

Typically, the arsenic content of mycorrhizal mushrooms collected from unpolluted areas is lower than 1mg/kg. In a 2007 Turkish study of 23 wild edible mushroom species (collected from areas not known to be polluted), S.coronaria had the highest concentration of arsenic at 8.8mg/kg dry weight, while the arsenic concentration of the other tested mushrooms ranged from 0.003mg/kg (in Sarcodon leucopus) to 0.54mg/kg (in Lactarius salmonicolor).|$|E
