40|$|Defence {{allegations}} about the malpractice of <b>intermediaries</b> in the Lubanga Case have revealed the ICC's dependence upon <b>intermediaries.</b> Yet, surprisingly, {{the role of}} <b>intermediaries</b> has received relatively little attention in the academic literature. Since 2009, the Registry has been developing a court-wide set of guidelines to manage the Court's relationship with <b>intermediaries,</b> which, if adopted, will substitute a large measure of standardisation over the disparate policies and practices currently in place across the various ICC organs and units. The Victims Rights Working Group and the Open Society Justice Initiative {{in conjunction with the}} International Refugee Rights Initiative are prominent amongst civil society actors that are playing a key role in advocating for the protection of, and support for, <b>intermediaries</b> through guidelines. This article examines the emerging position of <b>intermediaries</b> in international criminal law. It argues that adopting guidelines will inculcate a semi-institutionalised status for <b>intermediaries,</b> which both reflects, and contributes to, 'professionalization' in international criminal law. However, 'professionalization' is problematic {{to the extent to which}} it creates obstacles for the involvement of counter-hegemonic voices in international criminal law. Moreover, whatever gains guidelines may bestow on the Court and <b>intermediaries,</b> it is unclear how they can or will mesh with the emerging judicial response to <b>intermediaries</b> at the ICC. Ultimately, the increased regulation of <b>intermediaries</b> is likely to have a profound impact on relations between the different ICC organs; and it is set to be a touchstone for civil society-ICC relations more generally...|$|R
