500|$|The Los Angeles Times spent a full {{paragraph}} on a vignette {{about two}} high school prom dresses. [...] The junior prom dress was a conservative powder blue gown to wear with a nerdy date. The senior prom dress was a sexy black mini dress that was befitting of her more desirable date. The dresses presented an identity crisis to one character: [...] "Here's the thing – I've never really known for sure which {{of those two}} people I am – the girl who almost doesn't get asked to the prom at all or the girl who gets {{to go with the}} really cute guy. Every time <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> which one I was, I {{turned out to be the}} other. Which is one reason I think I got married, to, like, end the confusion." ...|$|E
2500|$|I became {{terrified that}} I {{was going to}} be a full-time, bomb-throwing {{terrorist}} if I stayed [...] because it was the beginning of really bad times in America. It was '66–'67, it was the first police riot in Los Angeles.... In college my major was political science, so my brain worked that way.... And I drove around this little English Hillman Minx—top down—and every night I'd be hauled over by the cops. Up against the wall, and all this stuff. They had this monologue with me; it was never a dialogue. It was that I was a long-haired drug addict living off some rich guy's foolish daughter. And I said, [...] "No, I work in advertising. I make twice as much as you do." [...] Which is a stupid thing to say to a cop....And it was like an epiphany. I suddenly felt what it was like to be a black or Mexican kid living in L.A. Before that, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what the world was like, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what poor people were, and then suddenly it all changed because of that simple thing of being brutalized by cops. And I got more and more angry and I just felt, I've got to get out of here—I'm a better cartoonist than I am a bomb maker. That's why so much of the U.S. is still standing.|$|E
2500|$|While {{out walking}} on New Years Day 1987, Drummond {{formulated}} {{a plan to}} make a hip-hop record. However, [...] "I wasn't brave enough to go and do it myself", he said. [...] "...although I can play the guitar, and I can knock out a few things on the piano, I knew nothing, personally, about the technology. And, <b>I</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> Jimmy , I {{knew he was a}} like spirit, we share similar tastes and backgrounds in music and things. So I phoned him up that day and said 'Let's form a band called The Justified Ancients of Mu-Mu'. And he knew exactly, to coin a phrase, 'where I was coming from'".|$|E
6000|$|... 'Bless my soul, sir!' cried Tom, 'I {{meant to}} mention that at first, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> had. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> them--her, <b>I</b> mean--directly. The gentleman who was ill at the Dragon, sir, last winter; and the young lady who {{attended}} him.' ...|$|R

5000|$|Iglesias {{stated that}} {{his high school}} days were the {{inspiration}} for the song. During a 2013 radio interview with Ryan Seacrest, he stated, [...] "I went back to when I was 17 in high school, and this might be cheesy, but <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> about what would be the song I want to slow dance to with my prom date. When I wrote it, it felt good and ... <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> there is something special in this song." ...|$|R
2500|$|Hussey {{joined the}} James Reyne Band {{and worked on}} Reyne's self-titled debut solo album (September 1987), co-writing six tracks with the artist. Four of these were issued as singles, [...] "Hammerhead" [...] (October), [...] "Heaven on a Stick" [...] (February 1988), [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] (June) and [...] "Always the Way" [...] (November). James later told Debbie Kruger that [...] " [...] was not {{necessarily}} about me, but let's say <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what I was talking about. I wrote it with Simon Hussey; the music Simon and I wrote together and I wrote the lyrics. From memory it seemed to come quite easily". The album peaked at No.4 on the Australian Kent Music Report Albums Chart, while [...] "Hammerhead" [...] reached No.8 and [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] at No.4 on the related Kent Music Report Singles Chart. [...] "Motor's Too Fast" [...] also reached No.6 on the ARIA Singles Chart.|$|E
2500|$|Blanchett {{returned}} to the theatre in 2009 with the Sydney Theatre Company production of Tennessee Williams' A Streetcar Named Desire, directed by Liv Ullmann. She starred as Blanche DuBois alongside Joel Edgerton as Stanley Kowalski. Ullmann and Blanchett had been meaning to collaborate on a project since Ullman's intended film adaption of A Doll's House fell by the wayside. Blanchett proposed embarking on Streetcar to Ullmann, who jumped at the opportunity after initial discussion. The production traveled from Sydney to the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York, and the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. It was critically and commercially successful and Blanchett received critical acclaim for her performance as Blanche DuBois. The New York Times critic Ben Brantley said, [...] "DuBois has been pulled gently and firmly down to earth by Ms. Blanchett and Ms. Ullmann ... What Ms. Blanchett brings to the character is life itself, a primal survival instinct ... All the baggage that any [...] "Streetcar" [...] usually travels with has been jettisoned. Ms. Ullmann and Ms. Blanchett have performed the play {{as if it had}} never been staged before, with the result that, as a friend of mine put it, [...] "you feel like you’re hearing words you thought you knew pronounced correctly for the first time."" [...] The Washington Posts Peter Marks proclaimed, [...] "What Blanchett achieves in the Sydney Theatre Company's revelatory revival of [...] "A Streetcar Named Desire" [...] amounts to a truly great portrayal—certainly the most heartbreaking Blanche I've ever experienced." [...] John Lahr of The New Yorker said of her portrayal, [...] "Blanchett, with her alert mind, her informed heart, and her lithe, patrician silhouette, gets it right from the first beat ... Blanchett doesn’t make the usual mistake of foreshadowing Blanche’s end at the play’s beginning; she allows Blanche a slow, fascinating decline ... I don’t expect to see a better performance of this role in my lifetime." [...] Jane Fonda, who attended a New York show, deemed it [...] "perhaps the greatest stage performance I have ever seen", and Meryl Streep declared, [...] "That performance was as naked, as raw and extraordinary and astonishing and surprising and scary as anything I've ever seen ... She took the layers of a person and just peeled them away. I thought I'd seen that play, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all the lines by heart, because I've seen it so many times, but I'd never seen the play until I saw that performance." [...] Blanchett won the Sydney Theatre Award for Best Actress in a Leading Role. The production and Blanchett received Helen Hayes Awards, for Outstanding Non-Resident Production and Outstanding Lead Actress in a Non-Resident Production award, respectively.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{have always}} loved him," [...] Joan answered. [...] "It was he didn't love me, for a time, as <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> {{now that he}} does." ...|$|R
6000|$|She {{appeared}} for {{a moment}} to reflect upon this: it was spoken in a tone that might have touched her. Yet {{at the end of the}} moment, lifting her eyes, she brought out: [...] "I hate art, as you call it. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> did, <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> did; but till this morning <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> how much." ...|$|R

5000|$|... "I moved closer, {{and pressed}} my lips tenderly against his; {{at last we}} began to stroll back to the car, our arms round each other's waists, my head on his shoulder, his lips in my hair. The moon went with us, jigging over the treetops, leering a bit now, <b>I</b> <b>thought.</b> <b>I</b> wished <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> what was {{supposed}} to happen {{when we got back to}} the car. St Winifred's had been as reticent about this as about Economics." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Is that so, Mr. Know-it-all," [...] {{retorted}} Peter. [...] "I don't {{believe you}} even know all your own cousins. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> all mine, but I found I didn't." ...|$|E

60|$|On this {{occasion}} I had no misgivings.

6000|$|... "Yes; but I haven't {{the courage}} I had when <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it all. I don't think I should ever amount to anything. It {{would be a}} waste of time." ...|$|E
