The wagon, still at {{approximately}} the same location where it originated, is rolled away and stored indoors nightly.

Unchanged, however, is the flagship product: small hamburgers cooked by oil <b>in</b> a <b>large</b> <b>skillet</b> and served on a roll with an onion, pickle, salt and pepper.

5000|$|A hoard of {{gold and}} silver objects was found in 1812, {{supposedly}} near Backworth and, according to Haverfield, was sold to a Newcastle silversmith. He resold [...] "all, or nearly all" [...] to Mr. J. Brumell, a Newcastle collector, from whom most of the objects passed in 1850 to the British Museum. The hoard consisted of: a silver skillet in which were a pair of silver-gilt trumpet brooches, one silver and five gold rings, one gold bracelet, two gold chains with wheel-shaped pendant, and a crescent attached, three silver spoons, another silver skillet, 280+ Roman denarii, and two first brass coins of Antoninus Pius. A white bronze mirror {{had served as a}} cover. The date of deposition is thought likely to be A.D. 140. The <b>larger</b> <b>skillet</b> and one of the gold rings each have an inscription, a dedication to the mother-goddesses. This list does not wholly accord with Haverfield's: in particular he suggests that an oval silver dish 18 inches long and 2 pieces of a silver bridle bit never reached the British Museum.|$|R

Molcajetes can also be used as a cooking tool, where it is heated to a high temperature using an open fire or hot coals, and then used to heat its food contents. Although true molcajetes are made of basalt, imitations are sometimes made of a mixture of pressed concrete and volcanic rock particles.|$|R
5000|$|In the 19th century, various patents {{were awarded}} in the U.S. and Europe for {{commercial}} roasters, {{to allow for}} large batches of coffee. Nevertheless, home roasting continued to be popular. A man working at a commercial roasting plant beginning in the 1850s in St. Louis, Missouri, said that [...] "selling roasted coffee was up-hill work, as everyone roasted coffee in the kitchen oven." [...] Appliances catering to the home roaster were developed; in 1849 a spherical coffee roaster was invented in Cincinnati, Ohio, for use {{on the top of}} a wood-fired kitchen stove, fitted into a burner opening. Green beans were available at the local general store, or even through mail order. For roasting, many people used such simple methods as a layer of beans on a metal sheet in the oven, or beans stirred in a cast iron <b>skillet</b> <b>over</b> a fire. Despite the wide popularity of home roasting, Burns felt that it would soon disappear because of the great strides made in commercial roasting in the 1860s and 1870s, including the benefits of the economies of scale. The commercial roaster inventions patented by Burns revolutionized the U.S. roasting industry, much like the innovations of inventors in Emmerich am Rhein greatly advanced commercial coffee roasting in Germany. As well, the 1864 marketing breakthrough of the Arbuckle Brothers in Philadelphia, introducing the convenient one-pound (0.45 kg) paper bag of roasted coffee, brought success and imitators. From that time commercially roasted coffee grew in popularity until it gradually overtook home roasting during the 1900s in America. In 1903 and 1906 the first electric roasters were patented in the U.S. and Germany, respectively; these commercial devices eliminated the problem of smoke or fuel vapor imparting a bad taste to the coffee. In France, the home roaster did not yield to the commercial roaster until after the 1920s, especially in rural areas. Coffee was roasted to a dark color in small batches at home and by shopkeepers, using a variety of appliances including ones with a rotating cylinder of glass, sheet iron or wire mesh, and ones driven by hand, clockwork or electric motor. Because of the smoke and blowing chaff, country dwellers generally roasted outdoors.|$|R

We find credit spreads to be negatively related to market size in small markets and positively related <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets. Syn-dicated loans play a different role <b>in</b> <b>large</b> versus small financial systems. In small markets, loan syndications are a substitute for missing public debt markets, while <b>in</b> <b>large</b> financial markets loan syndicates enable arrangers to spread risk more efficiently. Foreign banks tend to reinforce this effect. In small markets, they transfer external finance across borders and <b>in</b> <b>large</b> markets they tend to take on more risky projects. Consequently, we find that characteristics of loan contracts arranged by foreign banks <b>in</b> small versus <b>large</b> markets differ considerably...|$|R
40|$|The {{intensity}} of stone collection and stone theft by breeding Chinstrap penguins was measured, and estimations {{made of the}} number of stones per nest <b>in</b> <b>large</b> (> 400 nests) and small subcolonies (< 50 nests) <b>in</b> the <b>large</b> Vapour Col colony on Deception Island, South Shetland Islands. Stone availability was significantly higher both inside and outside small subcolonies. Penguins carried stones to the nest at the same rate <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, but stole more intensively <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies. Stones obtained by theft were significantly larger than those collected elsewhere. When stone availability was increased experimentally, individuals of large subcolonies collected more intensively than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> and small subcolonies, and stole significantly less than control individuals <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies, and as much as individuals in small subcolonies. The greater theft pressure <b>in</b> <b>large</b> subcolonies was accompanied by more aggressive defence by nest owners and by reduced succession stealing. However, the reduced availability of stones on the ground near large subcolonies led to a significantly lower number of stones per nest than in small subcolonies. These results are interpreted {{in the light of the}} geometric effects of breeding group size (perimeter to surface ratio) on stone accessibility. © 1995 Springer-Verlag. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
