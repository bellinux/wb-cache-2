40|$|Abstract. Environmental impacts {{associated}} with building materials are under increasing scrutiny in the US. A gate-to-gate life-cycle inventory (LCI) of solid strip and solid plank <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> production {{was conducted in}} the eastern US for the reporting year 2006. Survey responses from <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturing facilities in this region accounted for nearly 28 % of total US solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> production for that year. This study examined the materials, fuels, and energy required to produce solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring,</b> coproducts, and the emissions to air, land, and water. SimaPro software was used to quantify the environmental impacts {{associated with}} the reported materials use and emissions. Impact data were allocated on their mass contribution to all product and coproduct production of 1. 0 m 3 (oven-dry mass basis) of solid <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring.</b> Carbon flow and transportation data are provided {{in addition to the}} LCI data. Results of this study are useful for creating a cradle-to-gate inventory when linked to LCIs for the hardwood forest resource and the production of solid hardwood lumber in the same region...|$|R

For the Canadian Rockies, the {{mountain}} building is analogous to a rug being pushed on a hardwood floor: the rug bunches up and forms wrinkles (mountains).

Laminated wooden buttresses flank all the windows; in between {{them are the}} painted Stations of the Cross. Every third buttress is heavier and thicker. The walls are finished in shiplap below the windowsill level; above that a chair rail sets off a finish of grooved rectangles similar to those on the exterior.|$|E
25|$|The formal {{living room}} ceiling was hand painted and stenciled by Bryan Albert Painting Studio LLC located in Wauwatosa, WI. An Arts & Crafts-style {{chandelier}} {{was added to}} the room when electricity was installed in 1912. The room's <b>hardwood</b> <b>floor</b> was installed diagonally which was expensive at the time. An original Eastlake-style fireplace was brought out of storage during the 1974 reconstruction and two original ceramic dogs were placed on top. Next to the living room is the master bedroom which features a closet which were rare at the time since they were taxed as an additional room.|$|E

25|$|The arena has {{primarily}} {{served as}} a sports venue in its history. The arena was {{the home of the}} NBA's New Jersey Nets basketball franchise from 1981 to 2010. It was the home arena for the NHL's New Jersey Devils hockey franchise from 1982 to 2007 and the NCAA's Seton Hall Pirates men's basketball team from 1982 to 2007 as well as continuing to play host to various regular season men's college basketball, most recently on December 8, 2012, between Duke University and Temple University.

25|$|The pool has an {{accessibility}} lift, barrier free {{locker room}} entrance, exit for the women’s and men's locker rooms, and a gallery that includes seating space for wheelchair users. There is over 19,000 {{square feet of}} weight, cardio, and stretching space within the WSRC. Closest to the main entrance of the WSRC (which is actually the third floor) is the two-level weight and cardio space. There are also over 200 pieces of weight and cardio fitness equipment available for usage by members. Another amazing feature of the WSRC are the five gymnasia. There are three gyms on the first floor, and two more on the upper level. The three lower level gyms are an engineered sprung <b>hardwood</b> <b>floor,</b> 30×57 metres or 18,400 sq ft, while the two upper gyms are a poured athletic resilient floor for a greater multi-purpose use. Outside the lower gyms is the 1st floor games and activity lounge for table tennis, while outside of the upper gym spaces is additional cardio space {{as well as the}} destination for spin bike programming. Also on the 4th floor are two large studio spaces where the drop in fitness, clubs and dance courses take place.|$|E
25|$|The Hartington City Hall and Auditorium {{includes}} three levels: raised basement partially below grade, main level, and upper level. The basement level and main level are basically rectangular in plan, 75 feet (23 meters) wide (north-south along Broadway) and 130 feet (40 meters) {{front to back}} (east-west along Centre). However, the upper level plan is {{in the shape of}} a cross, so that the four corners are one story lower and function as wings. The two front wings project forward toward Broadway as well as laterally (north and south). The two rear wings are flush with the back (east) of the building. The southeast wing projects south and contains the two fire house doors, but the northeast wing does not project north. The basement originally contained the armory including officers’ quarters, lockers, supply room, and sleeping facilities for fire fighters, with the firehouse in back under the auditorium stage. The main level accommodated the lobby and city offices in front, the auditorium’s <b>hardwood</b> <b>floor</b> taking up the large middle, and the stage in back above the fire house. The cross-shaped upper level included a small space in front above the lobby and the stage fly space in back, but the bulk of it in the middle was simply open to the auditorium.|$|E

40|$|A nation–wide {{survey of}} <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> {{manufacturers}} {{was conducted in}} the spring of 1998. The objectives of the study were to determine the differences in beliefs towards certification between certified and non–certified <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers and to explore the decision to certify and the implications of that decision. Those objectives were chosen because certification is a developing phenomenon of which there are some aspects that remain unknown. The survey consisted of a mail questionnaire that was sent to more than 250 <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers. The questionnaire was used to collect demographic and attitudinal information from the respondents about certification. The second part of the research used the Analytic Hierarchy Process to model the decision process <b>hardwood</b> <b>flooring</b> manufacturers go through when deciding whether or not to certify.

The first basketball game was played against WSU on , commemorated with a visit by Vandal great Gus Johnson. [...] The main court was originally smooth tartan rubber, poured directly onto the pavement floor, resulting in a very hard and unforgiving surface, but resulted in a tremendous home court advantage under head coach Don Monson in the early 1980s.

2500|$|The {{music for}} Law & Order was {{composed}} by veteran composer Mike Post, and was deliberately {{designed to be}} minimal to match the abbreviated style of the series. Post wrote the theme song using electric piano, guitar, and clarinet. In addition, scene changes were accompanied by a tone generated by Post. He refers to the tone as [...] "The Clang," [...] while Entertainment Weekly critic Ken Tucker has referred to the sound as the [...] "ominous chung CHUNG", actor Dann Florek (in a promo) as the [...] "doink doink", and Richard Belzer as [...] "the Dick Wolf Cash Register Sound."
