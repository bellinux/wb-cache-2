2500|$|The term {{infrared}} microscopy {{refers to}} microscopy performed at infrared wavelengths. In the typical instrument configuration a Fourier Transform Infrared Spectrometer (FTIR) {{is combined with}} an optical microscope and an infrared detector. [...] The infrared detector can be a single point detector, a linear array or a 2D <b>focal</b> <b>plane</b> <b>array.</b> [...] The FTIR provides the ability to perform chemical analysis via infrared spectroscopy and the microscope and point or array detector enable this chemical analysis to be spatially resolved, i.e. performed at {{different regions of the}} sample. As such, the technique is also called infrared microspectroscopy [...] (an alternative architecture involves the combination of a tuneable infrared light source and single point detector on a flying objective). This technique is frequently used for infrared chemical imaging, where the image contrast is determined by the response of individual sample regions to particular IR wavelengths selected by the user, usually specific IR absorption bands and associated molecular resonances [...] A key limitation of conventional infrared microspectroscopy is that the spatial resolution is diffraction-limited. [...] Specifically the spatial resolution is limited to a figure related to the wavelength of the light. [...] For practical IR microscopes, the spatial resolution is limited to 1-3X the wavelength, depending on the specific technique and instrument used. [...] For mid-IR wavelengths, this sets a practical spatial resolution limit of ~3-30 μm.|$|E
