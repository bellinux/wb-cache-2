Because the Swedish peasantry had never been enserfed as elsewhere in Europe, the Swedish farming culture began to take on a critical role in the Swedish political process, which has continued through modern times with modern Agrarian party (now called the Centre Party).

2500|$|Arguably, the United States {{underwent}} {{a similar process}} during its own industrialization where child labor and the suppression of worker organizations were prevalent. [...] According to an article in Gale Opposing Viewpoints in Context, sweatshops became prevalent in the United States during the Industrial Revolution. Although the working conditions and wages in these factories were very poor, as new jobs in factories began to appear, people left the hard life of farming to work in these factories, and the agricultural nature of the economy shifted into a manufacturing one because of this industrialization. However, during this new <b>industrialized</b> <b>economy,</b> the labor movement drove {{the rise in the}} average level of income as factory workers began to demand better wages and working conditions. Through much struggle, sufficient wealth was created and a large middle class began to emerge. Workers and advocates were able to achieve basic rights for workers, which included the right to form unions, and negotiate terms such as wages, overtime pay, health insurance, and retirement pensions; and eventually they were also able to attain legal protections such as minimum wage standards, and discrimination and sexual abuse protections. Furthermore, Congress set forth to ensure a minimum set of safety standards were followed in workplaces by passing the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSHA) in 1970. These developments were able to improve working environments for Americans but it was through sweatshops that the economy grew and people were able to accumulate wealth and move out of poverty.|$|E

40|$|Financial market {{recommendations}} for less <b>industrialized</b> <b>economies,</b> {{particularly in the}} wake of the recent financial crises, have included a push for more international financial competition. The entry of multinational banks (MNBs) into developing economies is supposed to create more market discipline for domestic banks, thus making them more efficient, and enhancing financial stability. Using data from the BIS and the IMF, we look at the impact of MNBs on credit supply and on financial stability in less <b>industrialized</b> <b>economies.</b> MNBs focus their activities predominantly on serving MNCs, and on providing services that domestic banks cannot offer to domestic corporations, and high net worth individual. This increased competition in certain low risk market segments entices domestic banks to lower their credit exposure in the early stages of international financial competition. However, as MNBs continue to operate and to grow their market shares in less <b>industrialized</b> <b>economies,</b> domestic banks become more confident with the new competitive situation, eventually increasing their loans, especially to the enterprise sector.
