25|$|The North-West Yoruba dialects {{show more}} {{linguistic}} innovation than the Southeast and Central dialects. This, {{combined with the}} fact that the latter areas generally have older settlements, suggests a later date for migration into Northwestern Yorubaland. According to the Kay Williamson Scale, the following is the degree of relationship between Itsekiri and other Yoruboid dialects, using a compiled word list of the most common words. A similarity of 100% would mean a total overlap of two dialects, while a similarity of 0 would mean two speech areas that <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> relationship.|$|E

500|$|Critics gave mixed {{opinions}} to the team-up dynamic. Nich Maragos from 1UP.com celebrated that Sonic Team had [...] "finally [...] {{up with a}} way {{of introducing}} teamwork and variance between characters that doesn't overwhelm Sonic's bread-and-butter gameplay." [...] Maragos singled this out as the main divider between Advance 3 and Sonic Heroes, a game that he found surprisingly linear in level design considering that it, unlike Advance 3, was in 3D. Maragos, GameSpot's Frank Provo, IGN's Craig Harris, and Game Informers Lisa Mason appreciated the increase in replayability Sonic's friends brought. However, Mason, as well as reviewer Stardingo from GamePro, thought that they played too much like Sonic and did not add much to the experience. Darryl Vassar of GameSpy took a different point of criticism: he acknowledged the presence of genuinely different character abilities, but perceived that their only purpose was to find Chao, whom he called [...] "pointless". Maragos noted that the [...] "mid-air trick" [...] system from Advance 2 was optional in Advance 3, but spoke positively about its usefulness in locating [...] "hidden areas". Harris argued that such varying team abilities contributed to occasional [...] "cheapness" [...] in the level design, because [...] "most of the characters <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> defense when hopping off items like springboards".|$|E

What I'm going through {{is nothing compared to}} what they had to go through. Just know things do get better and you need to celebrate who you are."

500|$|Lasser {{provided}} {{ideas to}} his authors and commented on their drafts, attempting to improve both {{the level of}} scientific literacy {{and the quality of}} the writing. Some of his correspondence has survived, including an exchange with Jack Williamson, whom Lasser commissioned in early 1932 to write a story based on a plot provided by a reader—the winning entry in one of the magazine's competitions. Lasser emphasized to Williamson the importance of scientific plausibility, citing as an example a moment in the story where the earthmen have to decipher a written Martian language: [...] "You must be sure and make it convincing how they did it; for they <b>have</b> <b>absolutely</b> <b>no</b> method of approach to a written language of another world." [...] On one occasion Lasser's work with his authors extended to collaboration: [...] "The Time Projector", a story which appeared in the July 1931 issue of Wonder Stories, was credited to David H. Keller and David Lasser. Both Lasser and, later, Hornig, were given almost complete editorial freedom by Gernsback, who reserved only the right to give final approval to the contents. This was in contrast to the more detailed control Gernsback had exerted over the content of Amazing Stories in the first years of its existence. Science fiction historian Sam Moskowitz has suggested that the reason was the poor financial state of Wonder Stories—Gernsback perhaps avoided corresponding with authors as he owed many of them money.|$|E

[...] Anthony Benigno from Daily News felt that [...] "the shock songstress' new music video [...] is chock full of bed-ridden S imagery that makes it look like the softcore answer to The Matrix. Randall Roberts from Los Angeles Times said [...] "the clip reinforces the notion that no one understands the convergence of image and music right now better than Gaga." [...] Jed Gottlieb from the Boston Herald said that [...] "The plot [...] is hard to decipher, but it’s clearly not a story that ends happily ever after." [...] Jen Dose from National Post commented [...] "Gaga’s new vid for 'Alejandro' certainly brings the crazy we’ve all come to expect from her. It’s like an 8+ minute homage to Madonna—with some gay Nazis thrown in for good measure". Amy Odell of New York said the video's outfits were not as [...] "intense" [...] as those of [...] "Bad Romance" [...] or [...] "Telephone." [...] Nate Jones of Time Magazine disliked the song, but felt the video [...] "looks fantastic... the self-conscious ballsiness of Gaga and director Steven Klein works here." [...] Jennifer Cady from E! liked the video, but did not think it was as good as Gaga's previous work. Julie Moult from Daily Mail said [...] ", no-one could accuse Lady Gaga of being the shy and retiring type." ...|$|E
