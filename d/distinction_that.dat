5|$|Feminist economists {{often make}} a {{critical}} <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> masculine bias in economics {{is primarily a}} result of gender, not sex. In other words, when feminist economists highlight the biases of mainstream economics, they focus on its social beliefs about masculinity like objectivity, separation, logical consistency, individual accomplishment, mathematics, abstraction, and lack of emotion, {{but not on the}} gender of authorities and subjects. However, the over-representation of men among economists and their subjects of study is also a concern.|$|E

Arthur Wahl then began exploring the chemistry of the newly discovered element. In 1966, Room 307 of Gilman Hall on the campus at the Berkeley, where they did this work, was declared a U.S. National Historic Landmark.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1890s, R.C. Horner, a Canadian holiness evangelist, {{introduced}} a theological <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> {{would be important}} {{for the development of}} Pentecostalism. He argued in his books Pentecost (1891) and Bible Doctrines (1909) that the baptism in the Holy Spirit was not synonymous with the second blessing but was actually a third work of grace subsequent to salvation and sanctification that empowered the believer for service. Charles Fox Parham would build on this doctrinal foundation when he identified speaking in tongues as the Bible evidence of Spirit baptism.|$|E

Its students included Captain Thomas White and Lieutenant Richard Williams, with Harrison providing initial training to solo standard and Petre advanced instruction. In September, Harrison was given command of a flying unit that accompanied the Australian Naval and Military Expeditionary Force to Rabaul in German New Guinea. With {{little in the way of}} enemy resistance, however, the aircraft were never assembled in country and he had to return without leading the first Australian airmen into combat, a <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> instead went to Petre as commander of the Mesopotamian Half Flight the following year.|$|E
5|$|New Thought and Christian Science {{differed}} in that Eddy saw her views {{as a unique}} and final revelation. Eddy's idea of malicious animal magnetism marked another <b>distinction</b> (<b>that</b> people can be harmed by the bad thoughts of others), introducing an element of fear that was absent from the New Thought literature. Most significantly, she dismissed the material world as an illusion, rather than as merely subordinate to Mind, leading her to reject the use of medicine, or materia medica, and making Christian Science the most controversial of the metaphysical groups. Reality for Eddy was purely spiritual.|$|E

The 1955 version used 200 transistors, 1,300 solid-state diodes, and had a power consumption of 150 watts. The machine did however make use of valves to generate its 125kHz clock waveforms and in the circuitry {{to read and write}} on its magnetic drum memory, so it was not the first completely transistorised computer, a <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> went to the Harwell CADET of 1955.|$|E
5|$|Joseph Hopper {{was a local}} {{councillor}} and Methodist preacher {{who lived}} in Windy Nook and was {{the creator of the}} 'aged mineworkers home scheme' in 1898 which provided housing for miners who had retired and were no longer eligible for tenure by dint of their employment. The organisation he created, the , is today a registered charity which owns around 1,500 properties and had a turnover in 2012 of over six million pounds. A celebration of Hopper's work was produced after his death by John Oxberry, who was himself born in Windy Nook, in 1924. Oxberry, born in 1857, was a renowned local historian who traveled to New Zealand but returned to publish various texts, including Windy Nook Village; its inhabitants and their Co-operative store, and served a variety of roles on Gateshead Council with sufficient <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> he was made a Freeman of Gateshead in 1937.

By the end of hostilities, Schnaufer's night-fighter crew held the unique <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> every member—radio operator and air gunner—was decorated with the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross. Schnaufer was taken prisoner of war by British forces in May 1945. After his release a year later, {{he returned to his}} home town and took over the family wine business. He sustained injuries in a road accident on 13 July 1950 during a wine-purchasing visit to France, and died in a Bordeaux hospital two days later.|$|E

5|$|Shastry {{says that}} rhyme (Antyānuprāsa) is a {{distinguishing}} feature of Rambhadracharya's Sanskrit poetry. Shastry notes that another feature of Rambhadracharya's works is the devotion to motherland and patriotism, {{which is most}} evident in the poetic work Ājādacandraśekharacaritam {{on the life of}} Chandrashekhar Azad. Shastry says that this strong feeling of love towards motherland is reminiscent of old Sanskrit literature including Prithvi Sukta of Atharva Veda, various Puranas including Bhagavata Purana, and also in the Sanskrit works of Swami Bhagavadacharya, a former Jagadguru Ramanandacharya. Dikshit says that the nationalistic play Śrīrāghavābhyudayam establishes Rambhadracharya as a successful playwright at a young age. Dikshit praises the aesthetics of the work Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī saying that it represents all the six Sampradāyas of Indian literature (Rīti, Rasa, Alaṅkāra, Dhvani, Vakrokti and Aucitya), and that it is a unique work of Rambhadracharya when it comes to figures of speech. Dikshit says that this work places Rambhadracharya in the league of Ritikavya poets like Raskhan, Keshavdas, Ghananand and Padmakar; but observes the <b>distinction</b> <b>that</b> while the works of all these poets are primarily in the Śṛngāra Rasa, Śrīsītārāmakelikaumudī is a work which has Vātsalya Rasa as the primary emotion, which is augmented by Śṛngāra Rasa.|$|E
