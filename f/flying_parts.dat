40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{risk and}} sensitivity analysis of external events {{impacts on the}} safe operation in general {{and in particular the}} Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant safety systems. Analysis is based on the deterministic and probabilistic assumptions and assessment of the external hazards. The real statistic data are used as well as initial external event simulation. The preliminary screening criteria are applied. The analysis of external event impact on the NPP safe operation, assessment of the event occurrence, sensitivity analysis, and recommendations for safety improvements are performed for investigated external hazards. Such events as aircraft crash, extreme rains and winds, forest fire and <b>flying</b> <b>parts</b> of the turbine are analysed. The models are developed and probabilities are calculated. As an example for sensitivity analysis the model of aircraft impact is presented. The sensitivity analysis takes into account the uncertainty features raised by external event and its model. Even in case when the external events analysis show rather limited danger, the sensitivity analysis can determine the highest influence causes. These possible variations in future can be significant for safety level and risk based decisions. Calculations show that external events cannot significantly influence the safety level of the Ignalina NPP operation, however the events occurrence and propagation can be sufficiently uncertain. ...|$|E

In 2009, Central Command transitioned responsibilities in Africa to AFRICOM. The base has been considerably expanded, with drone <b>flying</b> <b>part</b> of the operation, and in 2014 a lease running at least 20 years was signed for its use.

40|$|Abstract — The paper {{implements}} {{an automated}} test system for evaluating flight simulator fidelity. Flight simulator fidelity {{is determined by}} direct comparison to flight test, the detailed design process and arithmetic are given. These problems about how to measure simulator fidelity and about how much fidelity is required to guarantee {{a certain level of}} transfer of training is solved. The automated test system consist of testing item file, the file parser,trim function and the <b>flying</b> <b>part</b> of the test,evaluation way and transport delay measurement. The design process extends the first phase research results and sums up the two phase results. The test results imply the system structure is reasonable, its performance is effective. The ability to set up and stabilize aircraft model for each test item and act on virtual pilot is the most important contributor to the test efficiencies of the flight simulator automated test system...|$|R

5000|$|Roberto Arnoldi (voiced by Vincent Tong) - Roberto Arnoldi is a {{sculptor}} {{who used to}} work for King Halbert and takes things very literally. One day, he was commissioned to make a [...] "smashing" [...] statue of Queen Halbert. When he literally made a smashing picture of Queen Halbert hammering some Scurriers and Globlins, Queen Halbert was pleased while King Halbert was displeased. After King Halbert fired him and kicked him out of Knightonia, Roberto settled in the Badlands near Mount Thunderstrox where he sold Stone Garden Gnomes that he carved in order to make money for himself. Upon meeting Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox, Roberto sided with them in order to get revenge on Knightonia where he started by making versions of Stone Garden Gnomes that have pointy heads. Roberto later made a new mobile headquarters for Jestro and the Cloud of Monstrox after the Evil Mobile was accidentally rusted by the Rogul that was associated with the Forbidden Power of Relentless Rust. During the attack on Burningham, Roberto has sculpted a <b>flying</b> <b>part</b> of the mobile headquarters that was animated by the Cloud of Monstrox' lightning.|$|R

50|$|Note, {{that in the}} United States, an airman's {{certificate}} is {{good for}} life. However, there are certain recurring training requirements before a pilot may exercise their license on a continuing basis.(i.e. the biennial flight review). Also, pilots in the Private, Commercial and Airline categories must meet the FAA aeromedical requirements for that particular license.

In addition to business executives, the airline derived {{a significant portion of}} its business from Norway's significant shipping industry.
