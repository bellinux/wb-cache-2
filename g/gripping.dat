5|$|Tooth shape {{depends on}} the shark's diet: those that feed on mollusks and {{crustaceans}} have dense and flattened teeth used for crushing, those that feed on fish have needle-like teeth for <b>gripping,</b> and those that feed on larger prey such as mammals have pointed lower teeth for <b>gripping</b> and triangular upper teeth with serrated edges for cutting. The teeth of plankton-feeders such as the basking shark are small and non-functional.|$|E
5|$|Only {{moderate}} {{force is}} needed to insert or remove a USB cable. USB cables and small USB devices are {{held in place by}} the <b>gripping</b> force from the receptacle (without need of the screws, clips, or thumb-turns other connectors have required).|$|E
5|$|Tyrannosaur {{arms are}} short when {{compared}} to other known predators. Horner argues that the arms were too short to make the necessary <b>gripping</b> force to hold on to prey.|$|E

50|$|Matched <b>grip</b> (also {{known as}} {{parallel}} <b>grip)</b> {{is a method}} of holding drum sticks and mallets to play percussion instruments. In the matched <b>grip</b> each hand holds its stick in the same way, whereas in the traditional <b>grip,</b> each hand holds the stick differently. Almost all commonly used matched <b>grips</b> are overhand <b>grips.</b> Specific forms of the <b>grip</b> are French <b>grip,</b> German <b>grip,</b> and American <b>grip.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are two {{categories}} of <b>grips</b> used in snare technique: matched <b>grip,</b> in which both hands hold the sticks in an overhand <b>grip,</b> and traditional <b>grip,</b> in which one hand uses an overhand <b>grip</b> and the other an underhand <b>grip.</b> Traditional <b>grip</b> is almost exclusively used on snare drum, and concert bass drum, while matched <b>grip</b> is used on all percussion instruments. Traditional <b>grip</b> is also primarily used in drum corps style marching environments, such as Drum Corps International.|$|R
5|$|Monument 67 is a badly eroded Olmec-style {{sculpture}} {{showing a}} figure {{emerging from the}} mouth of a jaguar, with one hand raised and <b>gripping</b> a staff. Traces of a helmet are visible. It is located to the west of Structure 12 and dates to the Middle Preclassic.|$|E
5|$|The {{middle toe}} of the California condor's foot is greatly elongated, and the hind one is only {{slightly}} developed. The talons of all the toes are straight and blunt, and are thus more adapted to walking than <b>gripping.</b> This is more similar to their supposed relatives the storks than to birds of prey and Old World vultures, which use their feet as weapons or organs of prehension.|$|E
5|$|The {{scales of}} Solomon Islands skinks are {{a dark green}} but are often {{speckled}} with light brown or black. The scales on the underside vary from light yellow to different shades of green. The toes on all four legs have thick, curved nails used for climbing and <b>gripping</b> tree limbs.|$|E

50|$|Most <b>grip</b> {{cars were}} short and open. Four {{different}} types of <b>grips</b> were used, one by each company and the WCSR’s south and southwest lines using a fourth. CCR used a <b>grip</b> that could <b>grip</b> {{either side of the}} cable, allowing the <b>grip</b> car to operate in either direction. NCSR and WCSR <b>grip</b> cars could operate in one direction only. None of the <b>grips</b> could be used on other lines. Approximately 700 <b>grip</b> cars were in service.|$|R
50|$|Players {{may choose}} between {{a variety of}} <b>grip</b> materials. The most common choices are PU {{synthetic}} <b>grips</b> or towelling <b>grips.</b> <b>Grip</b> choice {{is a matter of}} personal preference. Players often find that sweat becomes a problem; in this case, a drying agent may be applied to the <b>grip</b> or hands, sweatbands may be used, the player may choose another <b>grip</b> material or change his/her <b>grip</b> more frequently.|$|R
5|$|Camelot Software Planning spent between {{twelve and}} {{eighteen}} months developing Golden Sun, {{which is considered}} {{a long time for}} a handheld video game; the finished product was described as a testament to the positive results a long development cycle can bring to a game. In August 2000, Camelot showed an early but playable version at the Nintendo Spaceworld Expo in Japan. North American reviewers received the game {{a few weeks before the}} release, and IGN noted that the experience of developing Shining Force for Sega helped Camelot develop a <b>gripping</b> RPG for the handheld.|$|E
5|$|Mantises are {{an order}} (Mantodea) of insects that {{contains}} over 2,400 species in about 430 genera in 15 families. The largest {{family is the}} Mantidae ("mantids"). Mantises are distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical habitats. They have triangular heads with bulging eyes supported on flexible necks. Their elongated bodies {{may or may not}} have wings, but all Mantodea have forelegs that are greatly enlarged and adapted for catching and <b>gripping</b> prey; their upright posture, while remaining stationary with forearms folded, has led to the common name praying mantis.|$|E
5|$|Mitchell Gourley {{was born}} in Geelong, Victoria, on 2 June 1991. He was born a {{congenital}} amputee, with his left forearm ending a few inches below his elbow. Mitchell can move the tiny stump of his forearm and uses it to hold and manipulate objects by <b>gripping</b> them in his elbow. He plays a variety of sports including cricket, Australian rules football, basketball, mountain biking and rock-climbing. He attended at Geelong College, and as of 2014 is studying commerce at the University of Melbourne.|$|E
50|$|The waved {{badminton}} <b>grip</b> {{is a type}} of <b>grip</b> {{that has}} foam strips {{in the center of the}} <b>grip</b> wrap so that after the <b>grip</b> is applied, there will be 'grooves' on the <b>grip</b> that can help increase friction and comfort when holding the racquet.The only slight disadvantage of waved <b>grips</b> is that is slightly heavier than flat <b>grips</b> due to the excess foam for the grooves.|$|R

50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} <b>grips</b> used. In Under <b>Grip,</b> the rod is <b>gripped</b> firmly {{with the back}} of the hands turned towards the body. In Top <b>Grip,</b> the rod is <b>gripped</b> with the {{knuckles}} turned outwards.|$|R
5|$|The {{sea otter}} {{displays}} numerous adaptations to its marine environment. The nostrils and small ears can close. The hind feet, which provide {{most of its}} propulsion in swimming, are long, broadly flattened, and fully webbed. The fifth digit on each hind foot is longest, facilitating swimming while on its back, but making walking difficult. The tail is fairly short, thick, slightly flattened, and muscular. The front paws are short with retractable claws, with tough pads on the palms that enable <b>gripping</b> slippery prey. The bones show osteosclerosis, increasing their density to reduce buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|These lemurs have {{relatively}} long hindlegs. For <b>gripping</b> tree trunks and large branches, they have large {{hands and feet}} with extended pads on the digits, as well as claw-like nails. They have a long tongue which assists obtaining the gum and nectar, {{as well as a}} long caecum, which helps digest gums. Their procumbent (forward-facing) lemuriform toothcomb (formed by the lower incisors and canines) is long and more compressed, with significantly reduced interdental spaces to minimize the accumulation of gum between the teeth.|$|E
5|$|Arboreal animals {{frequently}} have elongated limbs {{that help them}} cross gaps, reach fruit or other resources, test the firmness of support ahead and, in some cases, to brachiate (swing between trees). Many arboreal species, such as tree porcupines, silky anteaters, spider monkeys, and possums, use prehensile tails to grasp branches. In the spider monkey, {{the tip of the}} tail has either a bare patch or adhesive pad, which provides increased friction. Claws can be used to interact with rough substrates and reorient the direction of forces the animal applies. This is what allows squirrels to climb tree trunks that are so large to be essentially flat from the perspective of such a small animal. However, claws can interfere with an animal's ability to grasp very small branches, as they may wrap too far around and prick the animal's own paw. Frictional <b>gripping</b> is used by primates, relying upon hairless fingertips. Squeezing the branch between the fingertips generates frictional force that holds the animal's hand to the branch. However, this type of grip depends upon the angle of the frictional force, thus upon the diameter of the branch, with larger branches resulting in reduced <b>gripping</b> ability. To control descent, especially down large diameter branches, some arboreal animals such as squirrels have evolved highly mobile ankle joints that permit rotating the foot into a 'reversed' posture. This allows the claws to hook into the rough surface of the bark, opposing the force of gravity. Small size provides many advantages to arboreal species: such as increasing the relative size of branches to the animal, lower center of mass, increased stability, lower mass (allowing movement on smaller branches) and the ability to move through more cluttered habitat. Size relating to weight affects gliding animals such as the sugar glider. Some species of primate, bat and all species of sloth achieve passive stability by hanging beneath the branch. Both pitching and tipping become irrelevant, as the only method of failure would be losing their grip.|$|E
50|$|American <b>grip</b> is {{a hybrid}} of the French <b>grip</b> and German <b>grip.</b> The palms of the hands {{typically}} are at about a 45-degree angle, and both the fingers and wrist are used to propel the stick. This <b>grip</b> is considered a general-purpose <b>grip</b> by percussionists because it combines the power of German <b>grip</b> with the finesse of French <b>grip.</b> Instruments {{it is used to}} play include snare drums and xylophones.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two basic}} <b>grips</b> - the palms-down <b>grip</b> and the {{baseball}} bat <b>grip.</b> For the palms-down <b>grip</b> the hands facing downward while holding the ski rope. For the Baseball Bat <b>grip</b> kneeboarders hold the handle just like a baseball bat.|$|R
5000|$|The reverse <b>grip</b> and underhand <b>grip,</b> is the {{opposite}} of the overhand <b>grip.</b> The palms of the hands face the gymnast. It is similar to the <b>grip</b> used in chin-ups. Forward giant swings are among the skills that use this <b>grip.</b>|$|R
5|$|Edge of Darkness {{was placed}} fifteenth (fourth {{position}} {{out of the}} dramas featured on the list) on the British Film Institute's list of the 100 Greatest British Television Programmes in 2000, the BFI describing it as “a <b>gripping,</b> innovative six-part drama which fully deserves its cult status and many awards.”. Radio Times television editor Alison Graham, in 2003, listed {{it as one of}} the forty greatest television programmes ever made. It was one of only seven dramas listed in Broadcast magazine's list of the fifty most influential television programmes, published in July 2004. In March 2007, Edge of Darkness was placed third in Channel 4's list of the Greatest TV Dramas. Also on Channel 4, Darius Jedburgh was listed eighty-fourth in their list of the One Hundred Greatest TV Characters in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Epic narratives, poems, sagas and allegories {{from all}} {{cultures}} tell such <b>gripping</b> tales {{that they have}} inspired countless other stories in all forms of entertainment. Examples include the Hindu Ramayana and Mahabharata; Homer's Odyssey and Iliad; the first Arabic novel Hayy ibn Yaqdhan; the Persian epic Shahnameh; the Sagas of Icelanders and the celebrated Tale of the Genji. Collections of stories, such as Grimms' Fairy Tales or those by Hans Christian Andersen, have been similarly influential. Originally published in the early 19th century, this collection of folk stories significantly influence modern popular culture, which subsequently used its themes, images, symbols, and structural elements to create new entertainment forms.|$|E
5|$|More recently, Japanese {{publications}} {{have emerged}} {{in an attempt to}} standardize taiko performance. The Nippon Taiko Foundation was formed in 1979; its primary goals were to foster good relations among taiko groups in Japan and to both publicize and teach how to perform taiko. Daihachi Oguchi, the leader of the Foundation, wrote Japan Taiko with other teachers in 1994 out of concern that correct form in performance would degrade over time. The instructional publication described the different drums used in kumi-daiko performance, methods of <b>gripping,</b> correct form, and suggestions on instrumentation. The book also contains practice exercises and transcribed pieces from Oguchi's group, Osuwa Daiko. While there were similar textbooks published before 1994, this publication had much more visibility due to the Foundation's scope.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike Poma's <b>grips,</b> Doppelmayr <b>grips</b> are double {{position}} <b>grips.</b> When {{the chair}} enters a terminal, the angled roller is pushed {{down by a}} metal strip, which opens a <b>grip</b> jaw. The jaw remains open until the chair reattaches to the cable upon departing the terminal. <b>Grip</b> clamping force is measured {{just prior to the}} double position <b>grips</b> reattaching to the haul rope while a carrier (chair) is exiting the terminal, in contrast to Poma's <b>grips,</b> in which <b>grip</b> force can be measured as the <b>grip</b> travels through the contour. Insufficient <b>grip</b> force triggers an alarm and brings the lift to a halt before the carrier reaches the first breakover tower after the terminal. Because of this design, most Doppelmayr detachable lifts are designed to allow operation in reverse. This allows a <b>grip</b> force-alarmed <b>grip</b> and carrier to be backed into the terminal for inspection or removal.|$|R
5000|$|Z <b>grip</b> - A <b>grip</b> used as {{the base}} of many card flourishes. It is {{accomplished}} by holding the deck in Mechanics <b>Grip,</b> then raising a packet of cards up from the deck in Biddle <b>Grip</b> while holding another packet between the thumb of the hand in Biddle <b>Grip</b> and the index finger of the hand in Mechanics <b>grip</b> to create a 'Z' formation. This <b>grip</b> is commonly used as a starter.|$|R
25|$|The second theory uses <b>grip</b> {{placement}} and angle {{as the primary}} factor in targeting each head. For instance, to target the long head when using dumbbells or cables, the <b>grip</b> should be semi-supinated (hammer) <b>grip</b> where the palms face each other. If using a barbell (EZ <b>grip</b> or straight), the <b>grip</b> should be inside of shoulder width. To target the short head when using dumbbells or cables, <b>grip</b> should be supinated, where the palms are facing up completely. If using a barbell (EZ <b>grip</b> or straight), <b>grip</b> should be outside of shoulder width.|$|R
5|$|Pendants in a {{distinctive}} shape representing the hammer of Thor (known in Norse sources as Mjöllnir) have frequently been unearthed in Viking Age Scandinavian burials. The hammers {{may have been}} worn {{as a symbol of}} Norse pagan faith and of opposition to Christianization, a response to crosses worn by Christians. Casting moulds have been found for the production of both Thor's hammers and Christian crucifixes, and at least one example of a combined crucifix and hammer has been discovered. The Eyrarland Statue, a copper alloy figure found near Akureyri, Iceland dating from around the 11th century, may depict Thor seated and <b>gripping</b> his hammer.|$|E
5|$|Phillip Manning {{and colleagues}} (2009) {{attempted}} {{to test the}} function of the sickle claw and similarly shaped claws on the forelimbs. They analyzed the bio-mechanics of how stresses and strains would be distributed along the claws and into the limbs, using X-ray imaging to create a three-dimensional contour map of a forelimb claw from Velociraptor. For comparison, they analyzed the construction of a claw from a modern predatory bird, the eagle owl. They found that, based on the way that stress was conducted along the claw, they were ideal for climbing. The scientists found that the sharpened tip of the claw was a puncturing and <b>gripping</b> instrument, while the curved and expanded claw base helped transfer stress loads evenly.|$|E
5|$|The Lives formed {{part of the}} Cabinet of Biography in the Cabinet Cyclopaedia. Within the set of ten, the three-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of Italy, Spain and Portugal (1835–37) and the two-volume Lives of the Most Eminent Literary and Scientific Men of France (1838–39) {{consist of}} biographies of {{important}} writers and thinkers of the 14th to 18th centuries. Most of them were written by the Romantic writer Mary Shelley. Shelley's biographies reveal her as a professional woman of letters, contracted to produce several volumes of works and paid well to do so. Her extensive knowledge of history and languages, her ability to tell a <b>gripping</b> biographical narrative, and her interest in the burgeoning field of feminist historiography are reflected in these works.|$|E
50|$|Most {{competitive}} gymnasts wear dowel <b>grips.</b> On {{the high}} bar, men use <b>grips</b> that have three finger holes {{and a small}} dowel, whereas <b>grips</b> used on the still rings have a larger dowel and two finger holes. <b>Grips</b> used on the parallel bars have two finger holes and a small dowel. Women's <b>grips</b> have two finger holes and resemble men's ring <b>grips.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Modern marimba music {{calls for}} {{simultaneous}} use of {{between two and}} four mallets (sometimes up to six or eight), granting the performer the ability to play chords or music with large interval skips more easily. Multiple mallets are held in the same hand using any {{of a number of}} techniques or <b>grips.</b> For two mallets in each hand, the most common <b>grips</b> are the Burton <b>grip</b> (made popular by Gary Burton), the Traditional <b>Grip</b> (or [...] "cross grip") and the Musser-Stevens <b>grip</b> (made popular by Leigh Howard Stevens). Each <b>grip</b> is perceived to have its own benefits and drawbacks. For example, some marimbists feel the Musser-Stevens <b>grip</b> is more suitable for quick interval changes, while the Burton <b>grip</b> is more suitable for stronger playing or switching between chords and single-note melody lines. The Traditional <b>Grip</b> gives a greater dynamic range and freedom of playing. The choice of <b>grip</b> varies by region (the Musser-Stevens <b>grip</b> and the Burton <b>grip</b> are more popular in the United States, while the traditional <b>grip</b> is more popular in Japan), by instrument (the Burton <b>grip</b> is less likely to be used on marimba than on a vibraphone) and by the preference of the individual performer.|$|R
40|$|The {{molecular}} mechanisms {{underlying the}} targeting and localization of glutamate receptors at postsynaptic sites is poorly understood. Recently, {{we have identified}} a PDZ domaincontaining protein, glutamate receptor-interacting protein 1 (<b>GRIP</b> 1), which specifically binds to the C termini of AMPA receptor subunits and {{may be involved in}} the synaptic targeting of these receptors. Here, we report the cloning of <b>GRIP</b> 2, a homolog of <b>GRIP</b> 1, and the characterization of the <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 proteins in the rat CNS. <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are � 130 kDa proteins that are highly enriched in brain. <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are widely expressed in brain, with the highest levels found in the cerebral cortex, hippocampus, and olfactory bulb. Biochemical studies show that <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are enriched in synaptic plasma membrane and postsynaptic density fractions. <b>GRIP</b> 1 is expressed early in embryonic development before the expression of AMPA receptors and peaks in expression at postnatal day 8 – 10. In contrast, <b>GRIP</b> 2 is expressed relatively late in development and parallels the expression of AMPA receptors. Immunohistochemistry using the <b>GRIP</b> 1 antibodies demonstrated that <b>GRIP</b> 1 is expressed in neurons in a somatodendritic staining pattern. At the ultrastructural level, DAB and immunogold electromicroscopy studies showed that <b>GRIP</b> 1 was enriched in dendritic spines near the postsynaptic density and was expressed in dendritic shafts and in peri-Golgi regions in the neuronal soma. <b>GRIP</b> 1 appeared to be clustered at both glutamatergic and GABAergic synapses. These results suggest that <b>GRIP</b> 1 and <b>GRIP</b> 2 are AMPA receptor binding proteins potentially involved in the targeting of AMPA receptors to synapses. <b>GRIP</b> 1 also may play functional roles at both excitatory and inhibitory synapses, as well as in early neuronal development...|$|R
