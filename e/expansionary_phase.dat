The importance of the model selection process is emphasized in an extensive search for the appropriate MS model.

The chosen two-regime MS model suggests four recessionary and five <b>expansionary</b> <b>phases</b> in the post- 1980 period. Business cycle phases are found to be asymmetric with the probability of switching from a recession to expansion exceeding the probability of switching from expansion to recession.

40|$|One {{strain of}} French {{structuralism}} has {{argued for the}} existence of long-run economic cycles driven by Marxist class and economic dynamics. Vincent Carpentier employs this approach in his study of the relationship between economic and educational change in the United Kingdom over the past two centuries. The basic framework was developed by Carpentier s mentor, Louis Fontvielle of the University of Montpellier, who has used it to examine the same relationship for France. According to this framework, leading modern economies such as those of France and the United Kingdom over the past two centuries have experienced four Kondratieff cycles of 50 years duration each. During the first three cycles, the level of resources devoted to education tended to move counter-cyclically; in the fourth cycle, the relationship reversed to move pro-cyclically. Fontvielle s explanation of this pattern is that during the first three cycles, during <b>expansionary</b> <b>phases,</b> high returns to physical capital implied pressures to cut back on public educational investments while during downturns, social stresses and contradictions in the system led to expanding educational investments. However in the fourth cycle, since 1945, both the rise of the welfare state and the increasing contribution of an educated labor force to productivity due to the increasing importance of science-based technical change resulted in the level of educational investments moving pro-cyclically. ...|$|R

40|$|Summary for non-specialistsThis paper {{examines}} {{the influence of}} governments' discretionary measures on tax revenues and tax elasticity in the European Union during {{the run-up to the}} 2008 / 2009 global financial crisis which was characterised by large swings in tax revenues. Using data collected {{in the context of the}} Output Gap Working Group of the Economic Policy Committee we show that while discretionary measures have had a limited impact on tax yields, they have in some cases significantly affected tax elasticities and thereby altered the relationship between tax revenues and the business cycle which plays a key role in the EU fiscal surveillance framework. Furthermore we provide evidence on the pro-cyclical nature of discretionary measures affecting tax revenues whereby governments tend to implement tax cuts during <b>expansionary</b> <b>phases</b> while resorting to tax increases during slowdowns. More generally our results suggest that the availability of detailed projections on the impact of discretionary measures by broad tax category would be instrumental to a better monitoring of tax revenues developments in the EU in order to better identify the role played by non-policy factors (such as asset prices) in driving tax revenues. Given that the time span covered by this database is in most cases still relatively short (covering on average 7 to 8 years) future updates of the data would allow to further dig into the issue of the influence of discretionary measures on tax elasticities as well as to provide elements for a backward assessment of fiscal plans vs. outcome. financial crisis barrios Taxation discretionary measures fiscal policy financial crisis fiscal stance business cycle Fargnoli...|$|R

40|$|The Great Recession, {{which was}} preceded by the {{financial}} crisis, resulted in higher unemployment and inequality. We propose a simple model where firms producing varieties face labor-market frictions and credit constraints. In the model, tighter credit leads to lower output, lower number of vacancies, and higher directed-search unemployment. Where workers are more productive at higher levels of firm output, lower credit supply increases firm capital intensity, raises inequality by increasing the rental of capital relative to the wage, and has an ambiguous effect on welfare.

We nd {{that the presence of}} downward wage rigidities strongly improves the t of the model to the skewness of variables and the relative length of <b>expansionary</b> and contractionary <b>phases</b> even when detrending the data. Due to the asymmetry, wages increase more easily in expansions, which limits vacancy posting and employment creation, similar to the exible wage case. During contractions nominal wages decrease slowly, shifting the main burden of adjustment to employment and hours worked. The asymmetry also explains the diering transmission of positive and negative demand shocks from wages to ination. Downward wage rigidities help explaining the asymmetric business cycle of many OECD countries where long and smooth expansions with low growth rates are followed by sharp but short recessions with large negative growth rates. labor market, unemployment, downward wage rigidity, asymmetric adjustment costs, non—linear dynamics...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{estimates}} {{a dynamic}} macroeconometric {{model for the}} US economy that captures two important features commonly observed {{in the study of}} the US business cycle, namely the strong co-movement of key macroeconomic quantities, and the distinction between <b>expansionary</b> and recessionary <b>phases.</b> The model extends the factor-augmented vector autoregressive model of Bernanke et al. (2005) by combining Markov switching with factor augmentation, modeling the Markov switching probabilities endogenously, and adopting a full Bayesian estimation approach which uses shrinkage priors for several parts of the parameter space. Exploiting a large data set for the US economy ranging from 1971 :Q 1 to 2014 :Q 2, the model is applied to measure not only the dynamic effects of unconventional monetary policy within distinct stages of the business cycle, but also the dynamic response of the recession probabilities, based on conducting counterfactual simulations. The results obtained provide new insights on the effect of monetary policy under changing business cycle phases, and highlight the importance of discriminating between <b>expansionary</b> and recessionary <b>phases</b> of the business cycle when analyzing the impact of monetary policy on the macroeconomy.

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. In {{common with}} {{emerging}} countries in Asia and Latin America, South Africa received substantial capital inflows following socio-political and financial liberalisation in the mid- 1990 s. However, {{unlike many other}} emerging countries, the bulk of South Africa’s post-liberalisation inflows {{have been in the}} traditionally short-term forms of portfolio and other investment. Hence, in this thesis, a macroeconometric analysis of South Africa’s post-liberalisation capital flow components is conducted to investigate the extent to which their divergent impacts have complicated, or even rendered impotent, the dual policy goals of attracting capital inflows on the one hand, while mitigating any significant detrimental impacts on the other. The results of the analysis show that foreign direct investment is responsive to domestic factors, while portfolio and other flows respond to a combination of domestic and foreign factors. However, domestic business cycle fluctuations are found to have a greater effect on the capital outflows than the capital inflows, and are thus associated with heightened capital flight and repatriation during <b>expansionary</b> <b>phases.</b> Although the capital flow components are found to have varied effects on South Africa’s macroeconomy, transmission mechanisms, nominal Rand/U. S. Dollar exchange rate, and economic growth dynamics, the ‘hot’ flows are found to demonstrate greater boom-bust characteristics compared to foreign direct investment. Conventional economic theory posits that the destabilising effects can be controlled using fiscal and monetary policy mechanisms. However, analysis of the cyclical relationships between the capital flows and fiscal policy finds that net direct investment and net other investment tend to be counter-cyclically associated with fiscal policy, while net portfolio investment tends to be acyclical, indicating that the bulk of South Africa’s net capital inflows do not have a significant cyclical relationship with fiscal policy. In addition, net direct investment and net other investment are found to have inconsistent cyclical relationships with monetary policy, while net portfolio investment tends to be procyclical. Thus, this research finds that although South Africa has been able to use exchange rate flexibility and sterilisation to neutralise the early stages of capital inflows, the divergent characteristics of the country’s post-liberalisation capital flow components have limited the fiscal and monetary policy options available to mitigate the detrimental capital flow effects arising from structural factors...|$|R
