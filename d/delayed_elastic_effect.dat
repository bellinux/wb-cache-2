40|$|Shear {{under stress}} in alkali borate glasses {{has been studied}} {{with the aid of}} a Pochettino viscosimeter. A new method of {{applying}} the stress, as compared with those of previous experiments in the literature, has been used. With this method the <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> can be separated satisfactorily from the viscous flow. Consequently, this method has yielded a measuring procedure to determine the velocity gradient for purely viscous flow. This method consists in measuring the velocity gradients at a certain deformation time at two different stress levels and taking their average. Rheological properties (viscosity and Bingham yield value) calculated from the average velocity gradients appear to be practically independent of time. Measurements performed in this way are considered sufficiently reliable to permit conclusions about the rheological properties. Finally, the observed <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> have been explained in terms of the structure of alkali borate glasses...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInorganic {{glasses are}} {{viscoelastic}} materials since they exhibit, below {{as well as}} above their glass transition temperature, a viscoelas-tic deformation under stress, which can be decomposed into a sum of an elastic part, an inelastic (or viscous) part and a <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> part. The <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> part {{is responsible for the}} non-linear primary creep stage observed during creep tests. During a stress relaxation test, the strain, imposed, is initially fully elastic, but is transformed, as the stress relaxes, into an inelastic and a <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> strains. For linear viscoelastic materials, if the stress relaxation function can be fitted by a stretched exponential function, the evolution of each part of the strain can be predicted using the Boltzmann superposition principle. We develop here the equations of these evolutions, and we illustrate their accuracy by comparing them with experimental evolutions measured on GeSe 9 glass fibers. We illustrate also, by simple equations, the relationship between any kind of relaxation function based on additive contribution of different relaxation processes and the <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> contribution to stress relaxation: the delayed elasticity is directly correlated to the dispersion of relaxations times of the processes involved during relaxation...|$|R

40|$|As a fully Lagrangian, particle-based {{numerical}} method, {{the traditional}} smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) generally {{suffers from the}} accuracy problem. To investigate the physical origins of this numerical error, the <b>elastic</b> <b>effect</b> between SPH particles is specifically identified by analogy with physical entities, and a unique non-dimensional number is proposed to evaluate the relative dominance of viscous to <b>elastic</b> <b>effect.</b> Through the simulation of two-dimensional Couette flow, the velocity profile and arrangement of particles are examined for various ratios of viscous to <b>elastic</b> <b>effect.</b> The effective viscosity of SPH particles decreases as this non-dimensional number increases, while the increase of particle number significantly reduces the effective viscosity only at lower ratio of viscous to <b>elastic</b> <b>effect.</b> The disparity among nominal viscous dissipation, total dissipation, and theoretical dissipation further confirms the presence of unphysical dissipation resulting from the <b>elastic</b> <b>effect.</b> In summary, due to the constraints from the Mach number and the ratio of viscous to <b>elastic</b> <b>effect,</b> there exists a critical Reynolds number below which the Newtonian behavior could be approximately obtained through suitable choice of model parameters...|$|R

40|$|We {{explore the}} {{dynamical}} and mechanical characteristics of an evolving gel in diffusing wave spectroscopy (DWS) and rheometry, aiming {{to assess how}} the gel evolution impacts the creep response of the system. Our gel is formed by inducing the aggregation of thermosensitive colloids by a variation in temperature. We find experimental evidence that the long time evolution of this gel is due to two distinct processes: A coarsening process that involves the incorporation of mobile particles into the network structure and an aging process that triggers intermittent rearrangement events. While coarsening is the main process governing {{the evolution of the}} elastic properties of the gel, aging is the process determining structural relaxation. The combination of both processes in addition to stress hardening governs the creep behavior of the gel, a creep behavior that is determined by three distinct contributions: an instantaneous <b>elastic,</b> a <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic,</b> and a loss contribution. The systematic investigation of these contributions in recovery experiments provides evidence that losses and <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> storage have a common origin, both being due to intermittent local structural relaxation events...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the development and}} Finite Element (FE) implementation of a stress dependent elasto-visco-plastic constitutive model with damage. The model comprises <b>elastic,</b> <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> and viscoplastic components. The strains (and strain rates) for each component are additive whereas they share the same stress (ie series model). This formulation was used so that a stress-based nonlinearity and sensitivity to confinement could be introduced into the viscoplastic component without affecting the behaviour of the <b>elastic</b> and <b>delayed</b> <b>elastic</b> components. A simple Continuum Damage Mechanics (CDM) formulation is introduced into the viscoplastic component {{to account for the}} effects of cumulative damage on the viscoplastic response of the material. The model is implemented in an incremental formulation into the CAPA- 3 D FE program developed at Delft University of Technology (The Netherlands). A local strain compatibility condition is utilised such that the incremental stresses are determined explicitly from the incremental strains at each integration point.

40|$|Acoustic {{waveform}} inversions are {{an increasingly}} popular tool for extracting subsurface information from seismic data. They are computationally {{much more efficient}} than elastic inversions. Naturally, an inherent disadvantage is that any <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> present in the recorded data are ignored in acoustic inversions. We investigate {{the extent to which}} <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> influence seismic crosshole data. Our numerical modeling studies reveal that in the presence of high contrast interfaces, at which P-to-S conversions occur, <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> can dominate the seismic sections, even for experiments involving pressure sources and pressure receivers. Comparisons of waveform inversion results using a purely acoustic algorithm on synthetic data that is either acoustic or elastic, show that subsurface models comprising small low-to-medium contrast (? 30 %) structures can be successfully resolved in the acoustic approximation. However, in the presence of extended high-contrast anomalous bodies, P-to-S-conversions may substantially degrade the quality of the tomographic images. In particular, extended low-velocity zones are difficult to image. Likewise, relatively small low-velocity features are unresolved, even when advanced a priori information is included. One option for mitigating <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> is data windowing, which suppresses later arriving seismic arrivals, such as shear waves. Our tests of this approach found it to be inappropriate because <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> are also included in earlier arriving wavetrains. Furthermore, data windowing removes later arriving P-wave phases that may provide critical constraints on the tomograms. Finally, we investigated the extent to which acoustic inversions of elastic data are useful for time-lapse analyses of high contrast engineered structures, for which accurate reconstruction of the subsurface structure is not as critical as imaging differential changes between sequential experiments. Based on a realistic scenario for monitoring a radioactive waste repository, we demonstrated that acoustic inversions of elastic data yield substantial distortions of the tomograms and also unreliable information on trends in the velocity changes...|$|R
40|$|We find {{three types}} of steady {{solutions}} and remarkable flow pattern transitions between them in a two-dimensional wavy-walled channel for low to moderate Reynolds (Re) and Weissenberg (Wi) numbers using direct numerical simulations with spectral element method. The solutions are called "convective", "transition", and "elastic" in ascending order of Wi. In the convective region in the Re-Wi parameter space, the convective effect and the pressure gradient balance on average. As Wi increases, the <b>elastic</b> <b>effect</b> becomes suddenly comparable and the first transition sets in. Through the transition, a separation vortex disappears and a jet flow induced close to the wall by the viscoelasticity moves into the bulk; The viscous drag significantly drops and the elastic wall friction rises sharply. This transition is caused by an elastic force in the streamwise direction due to the competition of the convective and <b>elastic</b> <b>effects.</b> In the transition region, the convective and <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> balance. When the <b>elastic</b> <b>effect</b> dominates the convective effect, the second transition occurs but it is relatively moderate. The second {{one seems to be}} governed by so-called Weissenberg effect. These transitions are not sensitive to driving forces. By the scaling analysis, it is shown that the stress component is proportional to the Reynolds number on the boundary of the first transition in the Re-Wi space. This scaling coincides well with the numerical result. Comment: 33 pages, 23 figures, submitted to Physical Review...|$|R
40|$|The {{incorporation}} of energy <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> in the modeling of flowing polymeric liquids is discussed. Since conformational energetic effects {{are determined by}} structural features {{much smaller than the}} end-to-end vector of the polymer chains, commonly employed single conformation tensor models are insufficient to describe energy <b>elastic</b> <b>effects.</b> The need for a local structural variable is substantiated by studying a microscopic toy model with energetic effects in the setting of a generalized canonical ensemble. In order to examine the dynamics of flowing polymeric liquids with energy <b>elastic</b> <b>effects,</b> a thermodynamically admissible set of evolution equations is presented that accounts for the evolution of the microstructure in terms of a slow tensor, as well as a fast, local scalar variable.

40|$|A new {{approach}} is {{proposed for the}} description of diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM). The crucial difference between our approach and the previous investigations is that our analysis includes diffusion not only along the grain boundary but also along free surfaces which are {{in contact with the}} grain boundary. The well-posed mathematical problem is formulated by matching the diffusional fields at the triple junction. We take into account the <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> which arise due to the sharp concentration jump in front of the moving grain boundary. By means of several simplifications we derive the closed equation for the steady-state velocity of DIGM {{as a function of the}} supersaturation and the system parameters. We find that mass transport at the free surface plays a very important role in the DIGM phenomena. The solution shows asymmetry between the cases of alloying and dealloying.

40|$|Small system {{sizes are}} a well known {{source of error}} in DFT calculations, yet {{computational}} constraints frequently dictate the use of small supercells, often as small as 96 atoms in oxides and compound semiconductors. In ionic compounds, electrostatic finite size effects have been well characterised, but self-interaction of charge neutral defects is often discounted or assumed to follow an asymptotic behaviour and thus easily corrected with linear elastic theory. Here we show that <b>elastic</b> <b>effects</b> are also important {{in the description of}} defects in ionic compounds and can lead to qualitatively incorrect conclusions if inadequately small supercells are used; moreover, the spurious self-interaction does not follow the behaviour predicted by linear elastic theory. Considering the exemplar cases of metal oxides with fluorite structure, we show that numerous previous studies, employing 96 -atom supercells, misidentify the ground state structure of (charge neutral) Schottky defects.
