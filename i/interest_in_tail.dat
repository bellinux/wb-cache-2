This field approximates the conditional Gaussian random field f (given that ∫_Te^f(t) dt exceeds a large value) in total variation. Based on this approximation, we show that the tail event of ∫_Te^f(t) dt is asymptotically equivalent to the tail event of _Tγ(t) where γ(t) is a Gaussian process {{and it is an}} affine function of f(t) and its derivative field. In addition to the asymptotic description of the conditional field, we construct an efficient Monte Carlo estimator that runs in polynomial time of b to compute the probability P(∫_Te^f(t) dt>b) with a prescribed relative accuracy.

Assuming the SRBM is positive recurrent, we are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> asymptotic of its marginal stationary distribution along each direction in the quadrant. For a given direction, the marginal tail distribution has the exact asymptotic of the form bx κ exp(– αx) as x goes to infinity, where α and b are positive constants and κ takes one of the values – 3 / 2, – 1 / 2, 0, or 1; both the decay rate α and the power κ can be computed explicitly from the given direction and the SRBM data. A key tool in our proof is a relationship governing the moment generating function of the two-dimensional stationary distribution and two moment generating functions of the associated one-dimensional boundary measures. This relationship allows us to characterize the convergence domain of the two-dimensional moment generating function. For a given direction c, the line in this direction intersects the boundary of the convergence domain at one point, and that point uniquely determines the decay rate α. The one-dimensional moment generating function of the marginal distribution along direction c has a singularity at α. Using analytic extension in complex analysis, we characterize the precise nature of the singularity there. Using that characterization and complex inversion techniques, we obtain the exact asymptotic of the marginal tail distribution...|$|R

The QBD process is typically used in the literature for studying the JSQ with 2 parallel queues, but the random walk also plays a key roll in our arguments, which enables us to use the existing results on tail asymptotics for the QBD process.

However, {{it is difficult to}} draw conclusions when comparing prevalence’s between studies and countries partly due to differences in management (e. g. differences <b>in</b> <b>tail</b> docking and enrichment routines) and partly due to differences in the definition of tail damage. Methods Tail damage and tail length was recorded for 15, 068 pigs slaughtered during three and four consecutive days at two slaughterhouses <b>in</b> Sweden. <b>Tail</b> damage was visually scored according to a 6 -point scale and tail length was both visually scored according to a 5 -point scale and recorded as <b>tail</b> length <b>in</b> centimetres for pigs with injured or shortened tails. Results The total prevalence of injury or shortening of the tail was 7. 0 % and 7. 2 % in slaughterhouse A and B, respectively. When only considering pigs with half or less of the tail left, these percentages were 1. 5 % and 1. 9 %, which is in line with the prevalence estimated from the routine recordings at slaughter in Sweden. A higher percentage of males had injured and/or shortened tails, and males had more severely bitten tails than females. Conclusions While the current method to record <b>tail</b> damage <b>in</b> Sweden was found to be reliable as a method to identify problem farms, it clearly underestimates the actual prevalence of tail damage. For monitoring and benchmarking purposes, both in Sweden and internationally, we propose that a three graded scale including both old and new tail damage would be more appropriate. The scale consists of one class for no tail damage, one for mild tail damage (injured or shortened tail with {{more than half of the}} tail remaining) and one for severe tail damage (half or less of the tail remaining). </p...|$|R

Numerous applications in finance, neuroeconomics, demographics and also weather and climate analysis make it necessary to extract common patterns and prompt joint modelling of individual curve variation.

In a variety of questions concerning the above applications one is more <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tail</b> asking therefore for tail event curves (TEC) studies.

Expectile regression captures the tail moments globally and the smooth loss function improves the convergence rate in the iterative estimation algorithm compared with quantile regression. The necessary penalization is done via the nuclear norm. Finite sample oracle properties of the estimator associated with asymmetric squared error loss and nuclear norm regularizer are studied formally in this paper.

We establish asymptotic normality for the estimator of individual probabilities by showing that, under certain conditions, the difference between this estimator and the empirical proportions is asymptotically negligible.

In this spirit, we modulate a two dimensional reflecting skip-free random walk {{in such a way}} that its state transitions in the boundary faces and interior of a nonnegative integer quadrant are controlled by Markov chains. This Markov modulated model is referred to as a 2 d-QBD process according to Ozaw (2013). We are <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tail</b> asymptotics of its stationary distribution, which has been well studied when there is no Markov modulation. Ozawa studied this tail asymptotics problem, but his answer is not analytically tractable. We think this is because Markov modulation is so free to change a model even if the state space for Markov modulation is finite. Thus, some structure, say, extra conditions, would be needed to make the Markov modulation analytically tractable while minimizing its limitation in application. The aim of this paper is to investigate such structure for the tail asymptotic problem. For this, we study the existence of a right subinvariant positive vector, called a superharmonic vector, of a nonnegative matrix with QBD block structure, where each block matrix is finite dimensional. We characterize this existence under a certain extra assumption. We apply this characterization to the 2 d-QBD process, and derive the tail decay rates of its marginal stationary distribution in an arbitrary direction.

Of particular interest is the lower bound obtained by taking the conditional expectation of the original sum S with respect to a conditioning random variable. This has proven to provide excellent approximations for various risk measures associated with S. The choice of this conditioning variable plays a crucial rolein arriving at a good approximation and intuitively, it could be chosen so that, in some sense, it is 'close' to the original sum S. In the literature then, variouschoices for have been proposed. For example, Dhaene et al (2002 b) propose to determine such that it {{can be viewed as a}} first-order approximation to theoriginal sum S. In another development, Vanduffel et al (2005) argue that the best is obtained when the variance of the resulting lower bound is as close aspossible to the variance of the original S. In this paper, we notice that these choices for are global in the sense that they lead to lower bounds for whichthe distribution function presents a global goodness-of-fit when compared with the original distribution function. In many financial and actuarial problems, however, we are usually only <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the <b>tails</b> of the distribution function. Hence, in this paper, we derive lower bounds approximations considered to be'locally' optimal. status: publishe...|$|R

Quantile regression (QR) offers an alternative methodological approach in which the influence of independent covariates on the outcome can be specified at any location along {{the distribution of the}} outcome. We implemented QR to examine heterogeneity in the influence of early childhood lead exposure on reading and math standardized fourth grade tests. In children from two urban school districts (n 1, 076), lead exposure was associated with an 18. 00 point decrease (95 % CI: " 48. 72, " 3. 32) at the 10 th quantile of reading scores, and a 7. 50 point decrease (95 % CI: " 15. 58, 2. 07) at the 90 th quantile. Wald tests indicated significant heterogeneity of the coefficients across the distribu-tion of quantiles. Math scores did not show heterogeneity of coefficients, but there was a significan...|$|R
40|$|Generalized {{regression}} quantiles, {{including the}} conditional quantiles and expectiles as special cases, are useful {{alternatives to the}} conditional means for characterizing a conditional distribution, especially when the <b>interest</b> lies <b>in</b> the <b>tails.</b> We develop a functional data analysis approach to jointly estimate a family of generalized regression quantiles. Our approach assumes that the generalized regression quantiles share some common features that can be summarized by {{a small number of}} principal component functions. The principal component functions are modeled as splines and are estimated by minimizing a penalized asymmetric loss measure. An iterative least asymmetrically weighted squares algorithm is developed for computation. While separate estimation of individual generalized regression quantiles usually suffers from large variability due to lack of sufficient data, by borrowing strength across data sets, our joint estimation approach significantly improves the estimation efficiency, which is demonstrated in a simulation study. The proposed method is applied to data from 159 weather stations in China to obtain the generalized quantile curves of the volatility of the temperature at these stations. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York...|$|R
