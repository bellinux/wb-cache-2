40|$|Using an <b>Internet-based</b> <b>industry</b> survey, the {{differences}} and similarities of offset and digital print demerits within the print industry are examined. Running parallel to this examination {{is a look}} at the extent to which demerit-based quality assurance procedures exist within the printing industry. The survey findings indicate that offset and digital printing processes share common color-related print demerits. What differentiates offset print demerits from digital print demerits can be attributed to two factors: (1) technology differences and (2) printing standards. Offset printing, given the multitude of material choices, produces more frequent print demerits, relating to non-conforming materials. Digital print demerits more likely result from technical constraints such as addressability and resolution. The other factor associated is a lack of printing standards for digital printers. While both processes show a high frequency of color-related problems, offset print providers have more tools and standards available for addressing these problems. Digital print providers, on the other hand, have few color standards or tools for solving similar problems. When examining procedures for defect prevention, the general lack of digital printing standards makes the use of formal quality assurance procedures difficult. Offset print providers {{are more likely to have}} formal quality assurance procedures for dealing with frequent and severe print demerits and formal procedures for how customer quality requirements are communicated...|$|E
40|$|How can we best {{reap the}} {{benefits}} of online profiling while avoiding the privacy pitfalls plaguing the e-commerce community? Experts advocate legislation, civil litigation, or self-regulation to provide the ideal solution. Analyzing these proposals reveals a conflict between two basic principles: the need to preserve personal privacy and the desire to foster a thriving <b>Internet-based</b> <b>industry.</b> This Note argues that each approach tends to favor one principle {{at the expense of the}} other. This Note also proposes a new solution which creates incentives for effective self-regulation backed with legal enforcement. This scheme strikes an appropriate balance between privacy and e-commerce principles and brings a flexible standard to address future innovation. Tracking a user 2 ̆ 7 s Internet activity seems intrusive because companies can exploit intimate information. For example, Sir Tim Berners-Lee, inventor of the World Wide Web, worries that searching for books on cancer could result in increased health insurance premiums because companies can track consumers 2 ̆ 7 online activity and then sell this information to the insurance industry. This apprehension will only increase as technology enables greater data collection and more accurate profiling. For instance, breakthroughs in deep packet inspection have opened the door to surveillance by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), which can now track everything a user does online. Advanced processing power then swiftly sorts this data into individually tailored profiles to be used or sold at the ISP 2 ̆ 7 s will. At the same time, online profiling brings users considerable prosperity. Credit reporting is cited as one of the best benefits of information sharing, saving consumers 2 ̆ 2 as much as 80 billion a year on mortgage loans because of the liquidity that credit bureau information makes possible. 2 ̆ 2 Online profiling also creates more advertising opportunities which then fund much of the content users currently access for free. The dilemma posed by online profiling is further discussed in Part I of this Note, which concludes that the optimal solution to the profiling problem must prevent privacy harms without smothering e-commerce. Part II then evaluates solutions which create a private cause of action and determines that using civil litigation to balance these interests is less than ideal. Part I examines existing self-regulatory efforts and legislative options. While self-regulation and legislation offer important advantages, each solution, by itself, suffers from considerable defects that render a single policy tool unlikely to satisfactorily resolve the profiling dilemma. Meanwhile, a frenzy of political action over ISP surveillance suggests that privacy problems are pressing enough to create broad support for legislation. Part IV proposes a solution to the profiling problem [...] a modified legislative approach which incorporates aspects of self-regulation. It then argues that this solution is ideal because it capitalizes on existing political momentum to create flexible and functioning standards that will increase personal privacy and nurture e-commerce...|$|E

In 27 original chapters, leading authors discuss theoretical and applied frameworks {{for the study of the}} economics of the Internet and its unique economics as a global information and communications infrastructure. They also examine the effects of the Internet on economic transactions (including social production, advertising, innovation, and intellectual property rights), the economics and management of <b>Internet-based</b> <b>industries</b> (including search, news, entertainment, culture, and virtual worlds), and the effects of the Internet on the economy at larg...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT- Supporting popular {{language}} model grammar formats, such as JSGF and XML-SRGS, {{has been an}} important step forward for the speech recognition community, particularly with respect to integration of human language technology with <b>Internet-based</b> technologies. <b>Industry</b> standard formats, though conceptually straightforward implementations of context free grammars, contain restrictions that make it nontrivial to support probabilistic finite state machines. These restrictions pose serious challenges when applied to all aspects of the speech recognition problem, such as the representation of hidden Markov models using in acoustic modeling. This paper compares and contrasts these formats, discusses the implications for speech recognition systems, and presents some solutions that have been implemented in our public domain speech recognition system...|$|R

40|$|In the {{agri-food}} <b>industry,</b> <b>Internet-based</b> applications {{changed the}} way companies conduct business mainly by facilitating activities that were already taking place, rather by giving birth to virtual networks creation. Due to the specific characteristics of the sector, Internet's huge potential has not been fully exploited yet, still remaining a new communication tool. This paper aims at giving empirical insights {{regarding the use of}} Internet-based applications in the agri-food supply chain, by focusing on the Greek fruit canning sector. In particular, the paper identifies companies' perceptions regarding perceived benefits, constrained factors and motivation factors towards the use of Internet-based applications. Results indicate that companies recognise benefits arising from the use of Internet, however they still use traditional ways when communicating with their partners. Regarding transportation issues, while companies' overall satisfaction is rather moderate and differs significantly from the importance placed on a number of criteria, companies are still sceptical in using Electronic Transportation Marketplace...|$|R
