40|$|Abstract Saying a {{word out}} loud {{makes it more}} memorable than simply reading it silently. This robust finding has been labeled the {{production}} effect and {{has been attributed to}} the <b>enhanced</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> of produced relative to unproduced items (MacLeod et al. Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition, 36, 671 – 685, 2010). Produced items have the additional information that they were spoken aloud encoded in their representations, and this information is useful during retrieval in certifying prior encoding. The present study explored whether production must be self-performed to be beneficial, or whether another person’s production also makes an item more memorable. In two experiments, the production effect was shown to be reliable when production was done by someone other than the rememberer (i. e., by the experimenter or by another participant), but substantially smaller than the benefit from self-performed production. Intriguingly, the effect was intermediate when production was done by both the rememberer and another person. Distinctiveness—and hence the production effect —is greatest {{to the extent that it}} is personal...|$|E
40|$|Serial {{position}} functions with marked primacy and recency {{effects are}} ubiquitous in episodic memory tasks. The demonstrations reported here explored whether bow-shaped serial position functions would be observed when people ordered exemplars from various categories along a specified dimension. The categories and dimensions were: actors and age; animals and weight; basketball players and height; countries and area; and planets and diameter. In all cases, a serial position function was observed: People were {{more accurate to}} order the youngest and oldest actors, the lightest and heaviest animals, the shortest and tallest basketball players, the smallest and largest countries, and the smallest and largest planets, relative to intermediate items. The results support an explanation of serial position functions based on relative distinctiveness, which predicts that serial position functions will be observed whenever a set of items can be sensibly ordered along a particular dimension. The serial position function arises because {{the first and last}} items enjoy a benefit of having no competitors on 1 side and therefore have <b>enhanced</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> relative to mid-dimension items, which suffer by having many competitors on both sides...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{we present}} a novel {{geometric}} representation for 3 D faces in order to <b>enhance</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> of generally smooth range images. This novel face representation is based on Multi-Scale Extended Local Binary Patterns (ELBP) and enables accurate and fast description of local shape variations on range faces. When associated with the proposed SIFT-based local feature matching scheme, this novel geometric facial representation shows its discriminative power in 3 D face recognition, displaying a rank-one recognition rate up to 97. 2 % and a verification rate of 98. 4 % at a 0. 001 FAR respectively on the FRGC v 2. 0 database. Moreover, costly registration is not needed thanks to the relative tolerance of the proposed representation and the SIFT methodology to moderate pose changes as the ones existing in FRGC v 2. 0. Finally, additional experiments demonstrate that the entire system is also robust to facial expression variations...|$|R

40|$|The {{production}} {{effect is}} the benefit in memory found for produced (i. e., read aloud) words relative to words read silently. It is {{proposed that the}} production effect {{occurs as a result}} of the <b>enhanced</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> associated with the produced items. The current research investigated whether attentional resources are required to encode and/or retrieve the distinctive information associated with the produced words. The literature suggests that the encoding of this distinctive information occurs automatically, but at test, purposeful attention is required to retrieve this distinctive information. To test this, participants read words aloud and silently, under either full or divided attention. Participants then completed either a recognition (Experiment 1) or free recall (Experiment 2) memory test under either full or divided attention. The findings show that when attention is divided at encoding, the benefit for aloud words remains for both recognition and free recall. When attention is divided at test, however, the benefit for aloud words remains for recognition but is absent for free recall. Overall, these results suggest that the distinctive information associated with produced words is encoded automatically, but it may not be accessible at test under attentionally demanding conditions...|$|E

Experiments with human listeners were conducted to establish appropriate stimulus materials. Then, eight European starlings (Sturnus vulgaris) were trained to respond differentially to vowel tokens drawn from stylized distributions for the English vowels /i/ and /I/, or from two distributions of vowel sounds that were orthogonal in the F 1 –F 2 plane. Following training, starlings 2 ̆ 7 responses generalized with facility to novel stimuli drawn from these distributions. Responses could be predicted well on the bases of frequencies of the first two formants and distributional characteristics of experienced vowel sounds with a graded structure about the central 2 ̆ 2 prototypical 2 ̆ 2 vowel of the training distributions. Starling responses corresponded closely to adult human judgments of 2 ̆ 2 goodness 2 ̆ 2 for English vowel sounds. Finally, a simple linear association network model trained with vowels drawn from the avian training set provided a good account for the data. Findings suggest that little more than sensitivity to statistical regularities of language input (probability–density distributions) together with organizational processes that serve to <b>enhance</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> may accommodate much of what is known about the functional equivalence of vowel sounds...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} {{acculturation}} process of Finnish consumers living in Madrid from the perspec-tive of maintaining ties to Finland. The behavior of these expatriate Finns {{was found to}} be strongly affected by group behavior, since one´s nationality {{plays an important role in}} social categorizations, therefore, social identity theory is used in this study. The objective of this thesis is discovering how Finnish expatriates in Spain negotiate Finnishness to participate in their identity formation process mainly at the social level of identity and in which activities this identity work results in. Also, how the participation in these activities affects acculturation to the new environment is discussed. By performing an analysis of narratives on the narrative reports of 8 Finnish nationals living in Madrid, Spain, several contributions to the study of consumer acculturation were suggested. It is argued that the expatriate Finns of this study identify themselves or at least get allocated by others to become members of the Finnish expatriate group. As they are invested in this membership, behaviors that en-hance their group membership result in various activities. These activities were allocated to several themes: trying to continue their life in two places, how mother language anchors identity, Finnish networks in Madrid, Finnish possessions, <b>enhancing</b> <b>distinctiveness</b> by using their ethnic background and bringing Finnish culture to be a part of one´s close relationships and thus, the relational level of social self. it is suggested that identification as an expatriate Finn, while supporting construction of a more har-monious identity, can however, postpone deeper acculturation to the new host culture. Such an identi-ty position can allow an identity with maintenance of certain Finnish attributes and loss of some to support desires to see oneself as more international, but can result in feelings of lower membership to the local group. On the other hand, it is suggested that modern technology can help the construction of a more unified self during movement, since it enables the membership in the expatriate group to be-come more meaningful for Finns, who are living abroad...|$|R
40|$|Words that deviate {{in their}} {{physical}} characteristics from their surrounding lead to enhanced recall memory, a pattern {{known as the}} Von Restorff effect. Furthermore, common (high frequency; HF) words {{are more likely to}} be recalled than uncommon (low frequency; LF) words when they occur in pure lists, while this pattern is reversed in mixed lists of both HF and LF words. This study investigated whether the Von Restorff effect and the reversal of word frequency effects in mixed lists, which may both be explained by <b>enhanced</b> perceived <b>distinctiveness,</b> are associated with common underlying brain processes. Event-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded while participants studied and subsequently recalled 70 word lists using rote memorization strategies. The three list types included (1) 14 regular-sized and one larger word, (2) 14 HF words and one LF word, or (3) 14 LF words and one HF word. The behavioral data showed a typical Von Restorff effect, a word frequency effect, as well as a reversal of the word frequency effect for LF words isolated in HF word lists (2 ̆ 2 LF isolates 2 ̆ 2). Larger words and LF isolates elicited a P 300, an ERP component associated with subjective distinctiveness, whose amplitude was correlated with subsequent recall for both word types. This indicates that LF isolates were perceived as distinctive, and that this perceived distinctiveness aided subsequent recall in a similar way as for physically deviant words. Both larger words and LF isolates also elicited a left-lateralized slow wave which was larger for subsequently recalled than for not recalled words. This ERP component supposedly reflects item-to-item elaborative processes, indicating that such elaborative processes are enhanced when LF words occur in HF word list. HF words isolated in lists of LF words did not elicit comparable ERP subsequent memory effects. Rather, for these 2 ̆ 2 HF isolates 2 ̆ 2, the N 400 was negatively correlated with subsequent recall, an ERP component that reflects semantic integration processes. We conclude that the reversal of the word frequency effect in mixed lists can be explained by a combination of <b>enhanced</b> subjective <b>distinctiveness</b> and <b>enhanced</b> inter-item elaborative processes for LF words that occur in lists of HF words...|$|R
30|$|This study {{proposes a}} novel {{algorithm}} that <b>enhances</b> the <b>distinctiveness</b> {{of the traditional}} vector of locally aggregated descriptors (VLAD) using spatial distribution clue of local features. The algorithm introduces a new method to compute the spatial distribution entropy (SDE) of clusters. Unlike conventional methods, this algorithm considers the distribution of full spatial information provided by local feature detectors rather than only utilizing the spatial coordinate statistics. For each cluster, the corresponding spatial distribution is computed using a histogram of spatial locations, scales, and orientations of all local features inside the cluster. Entropy is calculated from the spatial distributions of all clusters of an image to create a distribution function, which is further normalized and concatenated with the VLAD vector to generate the final representation. Image retrieval and classification experiments on public datasets are performed. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed algorithms produce better or comparable retrieval performance than several state-of-the-art algorithms. In addition, we extend our SDE to the convolutional neural network (CNN) feature, which further improves the CNN feature result in image retrieval.|$|R

Participants (N = 381), aged 9. 5 and 13. 5 years, judged an in‐group member’s decision to deviate from the norms of the group, whom to include, and whether their personal preference was the same as what they expected a group should do. Deviating from in‐group moral norms about unequal allocation of resources was viewed more positively than deviating from conventional norms about nontraditional dress codes. With age, participants gave priority to group-specific norms and differentiated what the group should do from their own preference about the group’s decision, revealing a developmental picture about children’s complex understanding of group dynamics and group norms.

40|$|Globalisation and {{subsequent}} competition among cities have triggered a profound {{change in the}} mode of the governance of cities. It is often described as a shift from a managerial mode of governance, which had been primarily concerned with provision of social welfare services and control of private activities, to that of entrepreneurialism, strongly characterised by a pro-economic growth strategic approach. Subsequently, attractiveness has been increasingly regarded as a key factor for urban policies, since attractive cities are competitive and able to attract newly-emerging businesses and highly-skilled workforces that are the driving force in the global economy. Today, enhancing urban attractiveness is high on the agenda of urban policy in many OECD countries. A city?s attractiveness is determined by a wide range of elements. The OECD report “Competitive Cities: A New Entrepreneurial Paradigm in Spatial Development” (OECD, 2007) analysed various elements contributing to urban attractiveness (e. g. flagship redevelopment, cultural facilities, international events, etc.). Among various findings, it emphasises that it is important for a city to <b>enhance</b> its <b>distinctiveness</b> by identifying and building up urban assets that are unique to the city.

In this study, we first produced a composite facial image from natural images of the six facial expressions of fear, sadness, surprise, happiness, disgust, and anger shown {{on a number of}} different individual faces (Ekman & Friesen 1975). We then caricatured the composite images with respect to a neutral (resting) expression. Experiment 1 showed that rated strength of the target expression was directly related to the degree of enhancement for all the expressions. Experiment 2, which used a free rating procedure, found that, although caricature enhanced the strength of the target expression (more extreme ratings), it did not necessarily enhance its purity, inasmuch as the attributes of nontarget expressions were also enhanced. Naming of prototypes, of original exemplar images, and of caricatures was explored in Experiment 3 and followed the pattern suggested by the free rating conditions of Experiment 2, with no overall naming advantage to caricatures under these conditions. Overall, the experiments suggested that computational methods of compositing and caricature can be usefully applied to facial images of expression. Their utility in <b>enhancing</b> the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the expression depends on the purity of expression in the source image...|$|R

Furthermore, particle swarm optimization (PSO) was implemented to improve the random detector generation in the negative selection algorithm (NSA). The algorithm generates detectors in the random detector generation phase of the negative selection algorithm. The combined NSA–PSO uses a local outlier factor (LOF) as the fitness function for the detector generation. The detector generation process is terminated when the expected spam coverage is reached.

A positive national image is an essential ingredient for promotion that raises the issue for necessity of investing into national branding as part of the image-building strategy. The article draws on primary and secondary data to provide insights into the processes and conflicts over efforts to brand Macedonia as an eco-friendly destination. The authors investigate the perception of hotel management when addressing the application of environmental concepts and energy renewable sources. The study took: (1) Quantitative methods, by calculating medians in terms of exploring the standard indicators for measuring eco policy and environmental protection practices; and (2) Qualitative methods, by consulting the secondary data sources. More precisely, an assessment is made on how hospitality industry stakeholders manage the environmental quality, since it can directly lead to increase the destination competitiveness.

40|$|The general aim of {{this thesis}} was to test the effects of paralinguistic (emotional) and prior contextual (topical) cues on {{perception}} of poorly specified visual, auditory, and audiovisual speech. The specific purposes were to (1) examine if facially displayed emotions can facilitate speechreading performance; (2) to study the mechanism for such facilitation; (3) to map information-processing factors {{that are involved in}} processing of poorly specified speech; and (4) to present a comprehensive conceptual framework for speech perception, with specification of the signal being considered. Experi¬mental and correlational designs were used, and 399 normal-hearing adults participated in seven experiments. The main conclusions are summarised as follows. (a) Speechreading can be facilitated by paralinguistic information as constituted by facial displayed emotions. (b) The facilitatory effect of emitted emotional cues is mediated by their degree of specification in transmission and ambiguity as percepts; and by how distinct the perceived emotions combined with topical cues are as cues for lexical access. (c) The facially displayed emotions affect speech perception by conveying semantic cues; no effect via <b>enhanced</b> articulatory <b>distinctiveness,</b> nor of emotion-related state in the perceiver is needed for facilitation. (d) The combined findings suggest that emotional and topical cues provide constraints for activation spreading in the lexicon. (e) Both bottom-up and top-down factors are associated with perception of poorly specified speech, indicating that variation in information-processing abilities is a crucial factor for perception if there is paucity in sensory input. A conceptual framework for speech perception, comprising specification of the linguistic and paralinguistic information, as well as distinctiveness of primes, is presented.

40|$|The nonhydrostatic Regional Ocean Modeling System {{is applied}} to {{study the effects of}} {{thermocline}} shoaling/deepening, bathymetry, and asymmetric modulated tides on the soliton growth to the west and east of Luzon Strait in the South China Sea and western Pacific Ocean. Luzon Strait comprises a shallow east ridge and a deep west ridge, and its interaction with barotropic tidal currents yields strong westward internal tides that disperse into solitons. Satellite imagery indicates that the westward solitons are more numerous and better defined than the eastward solitons. The model results show that the eastward solitons are 45 %, 39 %, 28 %, and 23 % smaller than the westward solitons due to asymmetric modulated barotropic tides at the east ridge, a deeper Pacific Ocean, westward thermocline shoaling related to the Kuroshio current, and internal tide resonance in a double ridge configuration, respectively. Due to the westward location of the Kuroshio, little thermocline deepening occurs east of the east ridge. Hence, the influence of thermocline deepening on counteracting eastward soliton growth is small. The Kuroshio mainly enhances westward soliton growth. The dispersion of internal tides into solitons is governed by the balance between the nonlinearity parameter {{on the one hand and}} the nonhydrostatic and Coriolis dispersions on the other. It is shown that this balance favors soliton growth for thermocline shoaling, while it counters it for a deeper ocean. A series of double ridge experiments is performed, in which the distance between the ridges and the height of the west ridge are varied. For a semidiurnal tidal forcing and two Gaussian ridges separated by 100 km, barotropic to baroclinic energy conversion is enhanced at both ridges, causing larger westward internal tides and solitons. The combination of Coriolis forcing, thermocline shoaling, and a double ridge configuration <b>enhances</b> the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the so-called type a and b solitons when a modulated tide occurs. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Non-human {{primates}} {{are capable}} of recalling events that occurred as long as 3 years ago, {{and are able to}} distinguish between similar events; akin to human memory. In humans, <b>distinctiveness</b> <b>enhances</b> memory for events, however, it is unknown whether the same occurs in non-human primates. As such, we tested three great ape species on their ability to remember an event that varied in distinctiveness. Across three experiments, apes witnessed a baiting event in which one of three identical containers was baited with food. After a delay of 2 weeks, we tested their memory for the location of the baited container. Apes failed to recall the baited container when the event was undistinctive (Experiment 1), but were successful when it was distinctive (Experiment 2), although performance was equally good in a less-distinctive condition. A third experiment (Experiment 3) confirmed that distinctiveness, independent of reinforcement, was a consistent predictor of performance. These findings suggest that <b>distinctiveness</b> may <b>enhance</b> memory for events in non-human primates {{in the same way as}} in humans, and provides further evidence of basic similarities between the ways apes and humans remember past events...|$|R
40|$|UnrestrictedImage {{matching}} is {{a fundamental}} task in computer vision, used to correspond two or more images taken, for example, at different times, from different aspects, or different sensors. Image matching is also the core of many multimedia systems and applications. Today, the rapid convergence of multimedia, computation and communication technologies with techniques for device miniaturization is ushering us into a mobile, pervasively connected multimedia future, promising many exciting applications, such as content-based image retrieval (CBIR), mobile augmented reality (MAR), handheld 3 D scene modeling and texturing, and vision-based personal navigation and localization, etc.; Automatic image matching, although notable progresses have been achieved in recent years, is still a challenging problem especially for applications on mobile platforms. Major technical difficulties include the algorithms’ robustness to viewpoint and lighting changes, processing speed and storage efficiency for mobile devices, and the capability to handle inputs from different sensors and data sources.; This research focuses on the advanced technologies and approaches of image matching, particularly targeting mobile multimedia applications. First, a real-time image matching approach is developed. The approach uniquely combines kernel projection technique with feature selection and multi-view training to produce efficient feature representations for real-time image matching. To address the computational and storage efficiency for mobile devices, our produced feature descriptors are highly compact (20 -D) in comparisons to the state-of-the-art (e. g. SIFT: 128 -D, SURF: 64 -D, and PCA-SIFT: 36 -D), suiting for applications on mobile platforms. Second, couple with the matching approaches, a fast data search technique has also been developed that can rapidly recover and screen possible matches in a large high-dimensional database of features and images. Third, in order to <b>enhance</b> the <b>distinctiveness</b> and efficiency of image features, a feature augmentation process has been proposed integrating geometry information into local features and producing semi-global image descriptors. Next, combining those developed techniques, an application system called Augmented Museum Exhibitions has been built to demonstrate their effectiveness.; Finally, the research is extended to matching images acquired from different sensor modalities, i. e. corresponding the 2 D optical images to 3 D range data from LIDAR sensors. The developed high-level feature based matching approach is efficient, being able to automatically register the heterogeneous data with significant differences...|$|R
40|$|Caste {{persists}} as {{an important}} socio-psychological phenomenon in many spheres of Indian social life and particularly within village contexts. It is argued that socio-psychological insights into caste identity and caste- based stigma may complement ongoing sociological and anthropological research into caste. Drawing upon identity process theory, this article explores the possible functions performed by caste-based stigma both for the higher caste groups (HCGs) and the ‘Scheduled Caste’ (SC) groups. It examines how {{the maintenance of the}} social hierarchy impli- cated in the caste system, the spatial and endogamous separation of caste groups and the historical division of labour in accordance with caste group affiliation, may impinge upon identity processes among both groups. It is argued that caste group affiliation and caste-based stigma have dif- ferential and sometimes conflicting implications for identity processes among the HCGs and SCs. While negative social representations of the SCs may threaten self-esteem among SC members, it may enhance the self-esteem, meaning and distinctiveness principles among the HCGs. The systematic positioning of the caste ingroup and outgroups within the social matrix may <b>enhance</b> meaning and <b>distinctiveness</b> among both the HCGs and SCs. This article highlights a potential rationale underlying caste group members’ resistance to social change vis-à-vis caste, even among those who might be expected to benefit from such change. Some theoretical points are made in the form of testable hypotheses and methodological issues in caste-related research are considered...|$|R
40|$|Alarm {{calls of}} the European Spermophilus citellus (EGS), Taurus S. taurensis (TGS) and Anatolian S. xanthoprymnus (AGS) ground {{squirrels}} {{share the same}} basic structure. They are tonal sounds consisting primarily of two different elements. The first element, often produced without the second element, has limited frequency modulation, while the second element is more frequency modulated. The present study examined whether this frequency-modulated element enhances the individual distinc­tiveness of calls, allowing calls to be ascribed with greater confidence to individual callers of the three species. Cross-validated discriminant function analysis (DFA) based on five acoustic parameters of the first element successfully classified calls to correct individuals (EGS: 90 %, TGS: 98 %, AGS: 96 %). Cross-validated DFA based on five acoustic parameters of the second element was also successful in classifications (EGS: 88 %, TGS: 86 %, AGS: 96 %), though discrimination of callers based on parameters of the second versus first element was {{the same for the}} AGS, lower for the EGS and significantly lower for the TGS. Cross-validated DFA based on five acoustic parameters of two-element calls also successfully classified calls to correct individuals (EGS: 93 %, TGS: 98 %, AGS: 97 %), though did not improve the extent to which calls could be classified to individuals beyond that based on the first element alone. Thus, the second element does not <b>enhance</b> the individual <b>distinctiveness</b> of calls, but may convey other information such as the location of the caller [Current Zoology 58 (5) : 749 - 757, 2012]...|$|R
40|$|Although {{faces and}} voices are {{important}} {{sources of information}} for person recognition, {{it is unclear whether}} these cues interact at a late stage to act as complementary, unimodal sources for person perception or whether they are integrated early on to provide a multisensory representation of a person in memory. Here we used a crossmodal associative priming paradigm to test whether unfamiliar voices which were recently paired with unfamiliar faces could subsequently prime familiarity decisions to the related faces. Based on our previous study, we also predicted that distinctive voices would enhance the recognition of faces relative to typical voices. In Experiment 1 we found that voice primes facilitated the recognition of related target faces at test relative to learned but unrelated voice primes. Furthermore, face recognition was <b>enhanced</b> by the <b>distinctiveness</b> of the paired voice primes. In contrast, we found no evidence of priming with arbitrary sounds (Experiment 2), confirming the special status of the pairing between voices and faces for person identification. In Experiment 3, we established that voice primes relative to no prime facilitated familiarity decisions to related faces. Our results suggest a strong association between newly learned voices and faces in memory. Furthermore, the distinctiveness effect found for voice primes on face recognition suggests that the quality of the voice can affect memory for faces. Our findings are discussed with regard to existing models of person perception and argue for interactions between voices and faces that converge early in a multisensory representation of persons in long-term memory...|$|R
40|$|Public {{support for}} {{renewable}} energy projects is important in transitioning towards a more sustainable energy system. However, the literature investigating local energy acceptability has predominantly focused on understanding local opposition to single (wind) energy projects. As a result, it has relatively little {{to say about the}} construction of support for such projects, and about the relative acceptability of other local contributions to sustainability. Also, by focusing on oppositional responses to energy projects, the willingness and ability of local communities to contribute constructively to the design of locally-supported energy developments has also been overlooked by many previous studies. In response to these limitations, this research adopted a focus on early stage ‘upstream’ deliberation of multiple local energy alternatives, using the British island of Guernsey as a case study. Informed by social representations theory, three studies investigated how potential future offshore wind, tidal and wave energy projects were represented by Guernsey residents to threaten, enhance or fit place-related values and meanings associated with Guernsey and its coast and sea. Working collaboratively with the Guernsey government’s Renewable Energy Team, a mixed methods approach with a focus on participatory, visual methods was adopted, including auto-photography (Study 1), deliberative focus groups (Study 2) and a questionnaire survey (Study 3). The research found Guernsey and its coast and sea to be meaningful to local residents in many ways and at different scales, including as a unique island in need of more independence, with a coast that is valued for its quietness, wildlife, leisure opportunities, tides, natural beauty and as a space for exploration. Public understandings of tidal and wave energy as a local energy option were highly diverse, and subsequently some but not all local offshore renewable energy options were represented as ‘fitting’ these place-related meanings. In particular, the notion of Guernsey’s local distinctiveness was found to be important; tidal energy projects were represented as <b>enhancing</b> this <b>distinctiveness,</b> while offshore wind energy was instead portrayed as making Guernsey more like everywhere else. Overall, local energy acceptance at such an upstream stage was found to depend to a substantial extent on the technology chosen, the selected site for the project, and on how the project is interpreted relationally within a context of wider energy systems, policies and the perceived availability of (more appealing) local alternatives. This thesis suggests that adopting an upstream, visual, place-based approach could be one way to both achieve a better academic understanding of the acceptability of local energy projects, and to {{contribute to the development of}} more acceptable energy development practices in the future.
