40|$|The Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (ITE) {{has been}} {{studying}} land use {{and the effects of}} land use on ecology for two decades. A series of national field surveys have been undertaken by the Land Use Section of ITE since 1978, the most recent being Countryside Survey 1990 (CS 1990). The three-year project brought together field survey and remote sensing data which were analyzed using Geographical Information Systems (GIS). National and regional land-cover patterns were described and changes estimated. The data collected by the field survey part of CS 1990 recorded stratified samples based on a land classification. Thematic maps for surveyed 1 -km squares covered physiography, agriculture and semi-natural vegetation, <b>forestry,</b> <b>structures</b> and boundaries. The same sites were surveyed in 1984 and 1990 with 14 000 digital maps produced describing both years. GIS was used to generate stock figures for each year, and overlay allowed change between survey dates to be estimated. GIS was used to compare data collected from both field survey and satellite imagery so that both sets of information could be qualified when expressed as national figures. This paper describes the historical development of the ITE Land Classification, examines the way in which data were collected for surveys, with particular reference to Countryside Survey 1990, and shows how satellite and field survey data can be linked through GIS...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of the paper is {{to contribute to a}} better understanding of the problems of economic integration of urban consumers’ demand and rural forestry production and possible solutions of forest-based entrepreneurship in small-scale forestry, wood processing and non-wood forest products and services in Bulgaria. The paper presents some results of the work undertaken in the frame of the first phase of the European project COST Action E 30 “Economic integration of urban consumers’ demand and rural forestry production”. The presented five topics concern consumption of forest related products and services, small-scale forestry practices as a factor affecting consumption and living standards in the country, wood-processing industries, non-wood forest products and services, as well as forests resources and their ownership structure as factors, affecting forestry production. It has been assumed the economic integration of urban internal and external consumers’ demand and forestry production in Bulgaria has to be developed. It is concluded that Bulgaria has significant resources and potential for further forestry production, which are not used effectively. The identified main barriers to entrepreneurship in the forestry, wood processing and non-wood products and services in Bulgaria are the low level of production and demand for forest – wood product services, and respective national policy. The lack of consensus for enterprise development in the forestry in Bulgaria defines a broad area of questions to be answered. Among them are which model for innovation system in forestry to be chosen? Which is the effective strategy for further integration to EU <b>forestry</b> <b>structures,</b> what kind of effective marketing strategies for Bulgarian products to develop in order to increase foreign consumers’demand? What kind of instruments to be introduced in order to increase sources for purchasing modern forest machinery, building forest roads and forestation? What kind of incentives to be implemented to improve the quality of local production and to protect industrial property rights? How to speed processes of standardization and certification?...|$|E

40|$|We {{investigated}} local {{forest management}} practices in Osaka, Japan aiming to clarify mechanisms that hinder long-term, sustainable forestry operation by carrying out forest surveys and interview surveys.

We found that the forest management plan for the study site utilized only one-seventh of the economic value of the forest, mainly due to the local <b>forestry</b> <b>structure</b> and an inefficient subsidy system that requires efficiency. The income yielded by timber undergoing such forest management and distribution processes is too low to permit forest owners to carry out sufficient forest cultivation. To effectively utilize the wood, a subsidy system that takes a long-term view and a timber market that puts an appropriate price on wood are needed.

High‐grading practices strongly modify the <b>forestry</b> <b>structure</b> by the means of bias in the dominant height and stand density. In order to achieve the silvicultural and site variability of Scots pine stands in the studied area, 75 plots from the National Forest Inventory of Spain (NFI) were selected. In these plots 46 dominant trees were cut down and 104 trees were bored at stump and at breast height (1. 3 m). In each plot a soil sample from the first 10 cm of soil was taken and signs of dimensional cutting were recorded. Site index curves and the edaphic discriminant rule were developed. The site index curve model used {{is an extension of}} the Richards model. The site factors selected in the discriminant rule represent the most important edaphic parameters for forest productivity (texture and the assimilability of the nutrients). Site quality of the studied stands was medium‐low as compared with other site index curves for Scots pine around the world. The edaphic discriminant rule presented is useful for estimating site index classes in stands exposed to dimensional cutting and in young stands of Scots pine in the the High Ebro Basin (northern Spain).

Under the community <b>forestry</b> <b>structure,</b> local people make decisions regarding forest management, utilization and distribution of benefits from a forest; they are organized as a Community Forest User Group. Presently about 1. 2 million hectares of forest is under the control of about 14, 000 Community Forest User Groups.

However, emerging evidence indicates that forest user groups have excluded rather than included women’s participation in their activities. This paper is based on the findings from six forest users groups implementing a program aimed at strengthening governance at the local level through increased women’s participation and increased advocacy skills and capacity of selected civil society groups. It presents the process of women’s empowerment in forest user groups by describing changes made in those groups once women begin participating and holding key decision-making positions. The findings note significant variation in funds allocated for social and community development activities, which are necessary to address the issues of poverty and social equity in Nepal. In addition, they note the importance of building both the capacity of individual women leaders and an enabling environment to support the women’s initiatives.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{observations of}} audio noise in frequency range 20 e 20 000 Hz from wind turbines. The observations were performed around the theoretically calculated 40 dBA noise perimeter around the wind turbine farm at Oxhult, Sweden. This paper describes a newly designed and constructed a ﬁeld qualiﬁed {{data acquisition system}} to measure spectra and total noise level of sound from wind turbines. The system has been calibrated at SP Borås. It is shown {{that it has a}} ﬂat frequency response and is linear with amplitude and time. The total noise level (as integrated 20 e 20 000 Hz) is shown to be below 35 dBA (below the reference background noise at 36 dBA) at a 10 m altitude wind speed of 4 e 5 m/s. The measurements were made along the theoretical 40 dBA border at 8 m/s. It is concluded that the theoretical 40 dBA border seems reasonable calculated if the manufacturer speciﬁcations are used to extrapolate the sound level to correspond to 8 m/s at 10 m. Our data indicate that a simple sound propagation model is sufﬁcient since the sound level is more affected by the nearby environment than the large scale forest structure. Also, the large scale <b>forestry</b> <b>structure</b> is bound to change with time and the error bars of measurements on total sound level are about 1 dBA, which is larger than any ﬁne tuning with a more sophisticated model. More care should be taken to model the reﬂections from walls and other obstacles close to the microphones. The distribution of the spectral noise level around the turbine farm suggests that the noise originates from individual wind turbines closest to the measurement location rather than from the wind turbine farm as a whole. The spectra show narrow band spectral line features which do not contribute signiﬁ-cantly to the total noise at this level. The narrow band features are only detectable at very long inte-gration time and at 1 Hz spectral resolution. The spectral features are typical to originate from mechanical noise. The spectral acquisition method described in this paper {{can be used as a}} ﬁeld qualiﬁed system for sound measurements in forest areas. The high spectral resolution is a viable remote diagnostic method for mechanical faults in the turbine machinery. Future work will concentrate on these two areas...|$|R

In order to assess the feasibility of combining community involvement with conservation, a case study from the Community Forest Programme was used to identify possible conflicting objectives. With the aim of identifying the social and environmental benefits that can be achieved from forestry and the methods by which these benefits can be achieved, survey data was collected from a variety of environmental organisations, including those from the Community Forest Programme. Also, a public survey was conducted from which information was gathered regarding the extent to which residents interact and engage with their local woodland. The research found that theoretically little compromise need be made to maximise the associated social and environmental benefits of forestry, although in practice external influences often require organisations to prioritise their actions. Depending on whether an organisation has a particular focus, the need to prioritise actions will result in either social or environmental benefits taking precedence over the other.

Specifically, we ask: after controlling for the effect of patch size, forest age and tree species composition, is there any residual effect attributable to the reduction in area of old forest? Pairs of landscape blocks (25 by 25 km) were selected to maximize area difference in human-induced disturbance, clear-cut as opposed to semi-natural old forest. Median distance to natural edge (wetlands, open water) from randomly selected points in forest was 250 and 200 m in high and low impact landscapes, respectively, indicating {{a high degree of}} 'natural' fragmentation of the pristine boreal landscape in the area. By contrast, median distance to clear-cut in uncut forest was 750 and 100 m, respectively. Clear-cuts in high impact landscapes were disproportionally more common in areas with contiguous forest land than in areas with spatially disjunct forest, implicating that forestry increases natural fragmentation of the landscape by subdividing larger forest tracts. Point counts along forestry roads showed that species richness and relative abundance of forest birds were higher in landscapes with low forestry impact. These differences can partly be explained by differences in age composition of forest and composition of tree species. After controlling for patch size, forest age and tree species composition, a significant effect of forestry impact remained for Sibirian species and the Tree pipit trivialis. Our results thus imply that this group of species and the Tree pipit may be sensitive to forest fragmentation.

The cork agro-forestry systems {{play a key role}} in ecological processes, and the outer bark, or cork, can be extracted sustainability without damaging the tree or affecting biodiversity. Because of the properties of the cork, an important <b>forestry</b> and industrial <b>structure</b> has been developed around its most valuable goods. This paper describes the current global trade patterns in the Iberian Peninsula, where Portugal and Spain are world leaders. Although these countries bring most of their cork trade flows together with the rest of the world, there are clear differences between these sectors. The aim of this study was to identify these differences and to characterize each analysed sector from an economic perspective. The primary difference between the sectors lies in the characteristics of their supply chain and their capacity to generate wealth from raw cork. Portugal primarily produces and processes raw cork into products with high added value. Spain bases its cork sector on raw material and half-manufactured cork, and it is not able to use the full potential that cork provides. Catalonia is an exception because it is the global leader in the champagne stopper market. To encourage the development of the entire cork sector, every link in the supply chain should be strengthened through the establishment of companies and the generation of employment, and therefore the development of rural areas. Moreover, this industry must establish its own development strategies for the future, thereby increasing its investment in R&D and innovation in relation to the opportunities identified as follows: the potential for diversification beyond the wine market, the improvement potential for forest management and the enhancement of sustainability and eco-efficiency in every link of the cork supply chain...|$|R
40|$|As {{this is a}} {{difficult}} period for countries throughout the world, the developing countries must implement survival strategies {{and at the same time}} endeavour to safeguard natural resources. In view of the current difficulties it is not easy to make a choice. In some areas the situation is such that more money is spent on fuel than on food. There is hardly any alternative to cutting down trees and destroying the forests if the people wish to survive. If this situation were to continue, the next generations would without doubt have an environment without a future. The stakes are high The rational conservation and use of the forests and their resources is now an integral part of agricultural or global policies. The fact that regular meetings are held to establish a concerted policy against desertification and the protection of nature indicates just how high the stakes are and the determination demanded by the situation. The fact that there is to be an international convention on desertification and other post-Rio initiatives confirms the concern. However, forestry research organizations in many of the developing countries may find it difficult to respond to the demands made of them and to make forestry play the role which it should naturally have in the quest for long term socioeconomic development. Research arrived at resolving the essential problems associated with trees and forestry deserves constant commitment, backing and effort in view of the many important roles played by trees. Continuity of funding Unfortunately, in view of the lack of long-term commitment and the consequent lack of continuity in funding, forestry research is not in a position to contribute fully to development. Funds allocated to forestry research in Africa are generally very limited. The assistance of the decision-makers must be enlisted to grant additional funds to the forestry sector and at the same time to ensure that research has a little more funding. There should be some adjustment in favour of research since development projects, the principal users of the results of trials, must have access to research. It is not easy for those who understand the significance of forestry research in the developing countries to accept that under 0. 26 % of the value of forestry production is allocated to research. If all available means have to be used to find funds to complete a trial using plant material which has been given up because funding has been interrupted, the strain on research workers is considerable. This is the real world of the earnest worker for whom continuity is vital since the least pause or interruption will result in the work no longer being reliable. In order to ensure independence and the regular funding of research work, it appears that it is essential to have specific funds, provided by development projects and partly by taxes paid by those who exploit the forests and/or a significant contribution from the national forestry funds. United we stand [...] . Every country can set up structures to suit its resources and its forestry policy. However, it is now essential to translate the desire for integration expressed by the decision-makers and politicians into action. <b>Forestry</b> research <b>structures</b> in developing countries appear very fragmented as there is no concentration of manpower, funds and logistic resources. Resources must be concentrated to produce structures which will be viable in the long term and employ effective teams of workers. The indications are therefore that workers engaged on specific subjects should be formed into groups. Programmes, operations or individual research work of any description, such as the genetic improvement of Faidherbia (Acacia) albida, must not be dealt with individually by each country engaged in this work. Furthermore, it is not logical for each country to have its own in vitro culture research unit for woody species. It is to be hoped that the programme to support forestry research in Asia and the Pacific can be enhanced and adapted to serve as a model for Africa south of the Sahara. To provide satisfactory results forestry research needs quality infrastructures. Perseverance is essential and there must be agreement over which work is to be given priority.

40|$|Due to the {{ever-increasing}} {{demand for}} model-based analyses of regional development policies in a multi-sector context, in 2009 the Institute for Prospective Technological Studies (IPTS) launched a {{project on the}} compilation of regional Social Accounting Matrices (SAM) for the NUTS 2 regions of the EU (IOTNUTS 2). The SAMs cover the time span between 2000 and 2005. This database shall permit general equilibrium analyses of policies like reforestation programmes, the promotion of investment in agro-tourism or environmental services, and the support {{for the production of}} renewable energy by farming enterprises, and, more generally, it will permit the evaluation of the rural development pillar of the European Common Agricultural Policy. Such measures primarily target the agricultural sector, but are likely {{to have an impact on}} other economic sectors and aggregate regional income, depending on the regional economic structure and the dominance of agriculture. Addressing regional heterogeneity requires multi-sector data on a sub-national scale. Such datasets are usually not sufficiently detailed, if available at all, which gave rise to numerous non-survey methods to generate regional Input-Output tables based on combinations of available regional indicators and national datasets (e. g. Location Quotients, GRIT methods). One particular challenge encountered during the IOTNUTS 2 project was the high level of sectoral aggregation in regional branch accounts provided by ESTAT, where agriculture, forestry, and fisheries are merged for example. Given the interest in spillover effects of dominantly agricultural policies, more detailed information was required. Therefore, statistical organisations of the 27 EU Member States were contacted and the results of previous projects on regional databases were screened. This paper gives an overview of the compiled inventory on regional datasets for EU 27, starting with the target structure of the database and the available national and regional datasets from ESTAT. Based on this, we discuss the datasets obtained from national statistical departments (NSO) and from previous projects with comparable aims. In general, we achieved a significant informational gain in comparison to the exclusive use of ESTAT datasets for several Member States although for some (i. e. Bulgaria) it was not as large as initially expected. Furthermore, we used the obtained NSO data to test the reliability of non-survey methods for the combination of national and regional datasets. It appeared that forestry, mining/quarrying, and fuel industries in particular displayed substantial deviations between derived indicators and those obtained from NSO, namely intermediate demand and gross output. For other branches, information could either be obtained (e. g. agriculture) or derived indicators proved to be close to the NSO values (most service sectors). In general, we conclude that for the majority of economic sectors considered, non-survey methods can generate reliable substitutes for otherwise collected indicators, but not for some critical branches which are usually concentrated in some regions and may dominate the regional economic <b>structure</b> (<b>forestry,</b> mining, fisheries). This result can be helpful for future projects with comparable objectives as we suggest that instead of attempting to sample economy-wide datasets, a focus on the mentioned critical sectors would provide higher marginal informational gains. The data collected from all the different sources are firstly utilized to populate national Input-Output tables for the EU 27 Member States. These matrices are then balanced following standard cross-entropy methods. These tables, with the suitable level of disaggregation, could be utilized as the starting point to update the EU Input-Output tables that IPTS provided to the GTAP Consortium. JRC.
