40|$|In this study, the {{neuroanatomy}} of {{the swine}} lumbar spinal cord, particularly the spatial orientation of <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> was correlated to the anatomical landmarks of the lumbar spine {{and to the}} magnitude of motor evoked potentials during epidural electrical stimulation (EES). We found that {{the proximity of the}} stimulating electrode to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> entry zone across spinal segments was a critical factor to evoke higher peak-to-peak motor responses. Positioning the electrode close to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> produced a significantly higher impact on motor evoked responses than rostro-caudal shift of electrode from segment to segment. Based on anatomical measurements of the lumbar spine and spinal cord, {{significant differences were found between}} L 1 -L 4 to L 5 -L 6 segments in terms of spinal cord gross anatomy, <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> and spine landmarks. Linear regression analysis between intersegmental landmarks was performed and L 2 intervertebral spinous process length was selected as the anatomical reference in order to correlate vertebral landmarks and the spinal cord structures. These findings present for the first time, the influence of spinal cord anatomy on the effects of epidural stimulation and the role of specific orientation of electrodes on the dorsal surface of the dura mater in relation to the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> These results are critical to consider as spinal cord neuromodulation strategies continue to evolve and novel spinal interfaces translate into clinical practice...|$|R

5|$|Vampire bats use {{infrared}} radiation to locate blood hotspots on their prey. A recent study {{has shown that}} common vampire bats tune a TRP-channel that is already heat-sensitive, TRPV1, by lowering its thermal activation threshold to about 30°C. This is achieved through alternative splicing of TRPV1 transcripts to produce a channel with a truncated carboxy-terminal cytoplasmic domain. These splicing events occur exclusively in trigeminal ganglia, and not in <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglia, thereby maintaining a role for TRPV1 as a detector of noxious heat in somatic afferents. The only other vertebrates capable of detecting {{infrared radiation}} are boas, pythons and pit vipers, {{all of which have}} pit organs.|$|E
5|$|Albatrellus subrubescens {{contains}} the bioactive compound scutigeral, which has antibiotic activity. This chemical—also {{found in the}} related species A.ovinus—may contribute to the mushroom's toxicity by disturbing the body's intestinal flora. Scutigeral interacts selectively to the dopamine receptor D1 subfamily (the most abundant dopamine receptor in the central nervous system, regulating neuronal growth and development, and mediating some behavioral responses). A 1999 publication suggested that scutigeral has agonistic activity at vanilloid receptors (a receptor found on sensory nerves in mammals); specifically, that it affects the uptake of calcium in the neurons of rat <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglia. Later reports failed to corroborate this pharmacological activity. One 2003 study reported that scutigeral acts as a weak antagonist on the human vanilloid receptor VR1, while another study published that year {{did not find any}} activity.|$|E

40|$|Although it {{is known}} that each spinal cord segment {{receives}} thin-fibre inputs from several segmental <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots,</b> it remains unclear how these inputs converge at the cellular level. To study whether C- and Aδ-afferents from different roots can converge monosynaptically on to a single substantia gelatinosa (SG) neurone, we performed tight-seal recordings from SG neurones in the entire lumbar enlargement of the rat spinal cord with all six segmental (L 1 –L 6) <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> attached. The neurones in the spinal cord were visualized using our recently developed oblique LED illumination technique. Individual SG neurones from the spinal segment L 4 or L 3 were voltage clamped to record the monosynaptic EPSCs evoked by stimulating ipsilateral L 1 –L 6 <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> We found that one-third of the SG neurones receive simultaneous monosynaptic inputs from two to four different segmental <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> For the SG neurones from segment L 4, the major monosynaptic input was from the L 4 –L 6 roots, whereas for those located in segment L 3 the input pattern was shifted to the L 2 –L 5 roots. Based on these data, we propose a new model of primary afferent organization where several C- or Aδ-fibres innervating one cutaneous region (peripheral convergence) and ascending together in a common peripheral nerve may first diverge at the level of spinal nerves and enter the spinal cord through different segmental <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots,</b> but finally re-converge monosynaptically on to a single SG neurone. This organization would allow formation of precise and robust neural maps of the body surface at the spinal cord level...|$|R

40|$|<b>Dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> (L 3 -L 7) {{isolated}} from immature (1 - 9 day old) rats were depolarized selectively by kainate (1 - 100 microM). L-Glutamate (25 - 100 microM), but not L-aspartate, mimicked {{the action of}} kainate. N-methylaspartate had no activity on these preparations and quisqualate was thirty times less active than kainate. Depolarizations evoked by L-glutamate (100 - 1000 microM) faded rapidly {{in the presence of}} L-glutamate. Depolarizations evoked by kainate were depressed during the fade induced by L-glutamate. Certain electrically evoked C-fibre volleys in <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> or leg nerves of rats at any age were selectively depressed or abolished in the presence of kainate. The effect of kainate was more selective than that of gamma-aminobutyric acid or capsaicin. Prolonged treatment of <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> with kainate {{did not appear to be}} deleterious to C-fibres. It is suggested that certain primary afferent C-fibres possess kainate receptors which may be activated physiologically by L-glutamate released at their central terminations...|$|R

Here, we describe an antibody-based quartz crystal microbalance (QCM) assay and its application for the quantification of AChE in the solutions of ventral and <b>dorsal</b> spinal <b>roots.</b> The frequency variation of the QCM device corresponds to the level of AChE over a wide dynamic range (0. 5 - 10 µg/ml), which is comparable to the response range of the ELISA method. The frequency shift caused by the ventral roots is 3 -fold greater than that caused by the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> The antibody-based QCM sensor was stable across many successive replicate samples, and the method required less than 10 min, including the AChE extraction and analysis steps.

25|$|The sensory {{modality}} that {{is detected}} by the afferent fibers {{is an important}} factor to consider because it determines the pathway that the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglion neurons will take within the central nervous system. The sensory neurons coming from the body synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, bringing in information about touch sensations (epicritic), or modalities of pain (protopathic). While both types of sensory neurons must first synapse in the dorsal horn of the spinal cord, the area of the dorsal horn where they synapse is different. Their pathway to the thalamus is also different.|$|E

40|$|Peripheral nerves to flexor (common peroneal) and {{extensor}} (tibial) nerves in a {{hind limb}} of seven 2 - 6 month old cats were cut and cross-united {{to study the}} plasticity in the spinal cord. The extent to which motoneurones from extensor and flexor motor pools were misdirected to their antagonistic muscles was determined by measuring the potentials generated at the spinal roots from the crossed nerves. The axons contributing to the extensor nerves normally leave the cord in the L 7 and S 1 ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> while the axons contributing to the flexor nerves normally leave the cord in the L 6 and L 7 ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> Following cross-union, medial gastrocnemius (m. g.) and lateral gastrocnemius-soleus (l. g. s.) nerves were primarily supplied by L 6 and L 7 ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots,</b> and common peroneal (c. p.) nerves were primarily supplied by L 7 and S 1 ventral and <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> A method for quantifying the completeness of cross-reinnervation was developed. The pattern of e. m. g. activity in cross-reinnervated muscles during locomotion was primarily determined by the innervating nerve with the reinnervated flexor muscles being activated during the extensor phase. However, the cross-reinnervated extensor muscles showed evidence of extensor activity {{in addition to the}} double-burst pattern typical of flexor nerves. This extensor activity was more prominent when the nerve cross was less complete. We conclude that during locomotion the activity of spinal motoneurones was not substantially modified by inappropriate peripheral connexions, even when the nerve cross was carried out in young animals. This conclusion is discussed in relation to previous studies which suggested some degree of functional modification...|$|R
40|$|In animal experiments, nerve transection is {{followed}} by expression of nerve growth factor receptors (NGFR) on Schwann cells of both motor and sensory nerve fibres distally {{to the site of}} the lesion. To determine whether denervated Schwann cells in amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) similarly express NGFR, a study was made of post-mortem material of peripheral nerves and ventral roots from ALS cases and age-matched controls, using immunolabelling methods. <b>Dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> and spinal cords were also examined for the presence of NGFR. In all the ALS cases and controls, NGFR immunostaining was seen in the outer layer of vessel walls, perineurial sheaths, connective tissue surrounding fascicles in nerve roots and in the substantia gelatinosa of the spinal cord. In ALS, NGFR staining was also present in the Schwann cells of degenerated nerve fibres in mixed peripheral nerves, in ventral roots and, to a lesser extent, in <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots.</b> NGFR immunoreactivity was also seen in elongated cells extending from the perifascicular connective tissue into the nerve fascicles. It is concluded that denervated Schwann cells in ALS express NGFR and that NGFR immunostaining on Schwann cells may be used as an indicator of axonal degeneration. The NGFR labelling in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> supports the notion that ALS is not a pure motor syndrom...|$|R

To remedy this lack of understanding, Head chose to investigate the anatomic distribution of cutaneous disturbances caused by herpes zoster. A careful study with A.W. Campbell enabled him to demonstrate the zones of skin affected by disease and from this he could chart the cutaneous distribution of different fibres originating from cells of each ganglion and reaching the corresponding segment of the spinal cord.|$|E
25|$|A {{key factor}} in the neural {{plasticity}} underlying neuropathic pain is altered gene expression in sensory <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglia neurons. Injury to sensory nerves induces neurochemical, physiological and anatomical modifications to afferent and central neurons, such as afferent terminal sprouting and inhibitory interneuron loss. Following nerve damage, NaCl channel accumulation causes hyperexcitability, and downregulation of the TTX-resistant Nav1.8 (sensory neuron specific, SNS1) channel and upregulation of TTX-sensitive Nav1.3 (brain type III) and TRPV1 channels. These changes contribute to increased NMDA glutamate receptor-dependent excitability of spinal dorsal horn neurons and are restricted to the ipsilateral (injured) side. A combination of these factors could contribute to the neuropathic pain state of postherpetic neuralgia.|$|E
25|$|In March 1989, Coulter, Huguenard and Prince {{showed that}} {{ethosuximide}} and dimethadione, both effective anti-absence agents, reduced low-threshold Ca2+ currents in T-type calcium channels in freshly removed thalamic neurons.

The next year, they showed that anticonvulsant succinimides did this and that the pro-convulsant ones did not.

40|$|The {{clinical}} and radiological features in seven {{patients who had}} asymmetric muscular atrophy of the hand and forearm when young are reported and a new hypothesis for its aetiology is proposed. Investigation of body growth curves (a surrogate for velocity of arm growth) showed close relation between (a) the age when the body height increased most rapidly and the onset age of this disorder, and (b) the age when the rapid body growth period ended and the age when symptom progression ceased. Cervical radiological evidence is provided showing asymmetric anterior cord atrophy, disappearance of slackness of <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> in neck extension, and anterior and lateral displacement of the lower cervical cord against the posterior aspects of the vertebral bodies during neck flexion. These results suggest that disproportionate shortening of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>roots</b> is further accentuated during the juvenile growth spurt, which determines the onset and self limited course of the condition, and that repeated neck flexion causes micro-trauma and relative ischaemia of anterior horn cells, which finally results in atrophy of the muscles innervated by motoneurons with long axons.

25|$|It was {{hypothesized}} that interactions between neurotrophic factors could alter the optimal concentrations of each factor. While cell survival and phenotype maintenance are important, the emphasis of evaluation was on neurite extension. A combination of NGF, glial cell-line derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), and ciliary neurotrophic factor (CNTF) was presented to <b>Dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglion cultures in vitro. One factor from each neurotrophic family was used. It was determined {{that there is not}} a difference in individual optimal concentration and combinatorial optimal concentration; however, around day 5 or 6 the neurites ceased extension and began to degrade.

Future studies on neurotrophic factor combinations will need to include gradients.|$|E
25|$|Primary erythromelalgia is {{a better}} {{understood}} autosomal dominant disorder. The neuropathological symptoms of primary erythromelalgia arise from hyperexcitability of C-fibers in the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglion. Specifically, nociceptors (neurons responsible for the sensation and conduction of painful stimuli) {{appear to be the}} primarily affect neurons in these fibers. This hyperexcitability results in the severe burning pain experienced by patients. While the neuropathological symptoms are a result of hyperexcitability, microvascular alterations in erythromelalgia are due to hypoexcitability. The sympathetic nervous system controls cutaneous vascular tone and altered response of this system to stimuli such as heat likely results in the observed microvascular symptoms. In both cases, these changes in excitability are typically due to mutation of the sodium channel NaV1.7. These differences in excitability alterations between the sympathetic nervous system and nociceptors is due to different expression of sodium channels other than NaV1.7 in them.|$|E
25|$|There are 10 known {{mutations}} in the voltage-gated sodium channel α-subunit NaV1.7 encoding gene, SCN9A. This channel is expressed primarily in nociceptors of the <b>dorsal</b> <b>root</b> ganglion and the sympathetic ganglion neurons. Nine of these mutations have received further study {{and they have}} all shown to result in similar biophysical alterations, Table 1. As {{can be seen from}} table 1, the primary effect of erythromelalgia mutations is NaV1.7 channels that activate at more hyperpolarized potentials. NaV1.7 channels act largely as threshold sensors and initiate action potentials. Consequently, this shift in their activation profile results in channels that open closer to the resting membrane potential. In many mutations, this shift of activation is accompanied by shifts in the voltage sensitivity of fast and/or slow inactivation, often in the depolarized direction. This results in channels that are open for a longer of period of time, producing larger and more prolonged changes in membrane potential.|$|E
