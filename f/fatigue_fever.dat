Symptoms of meningococcal meningitis are easily confused with those caused by other bacteria, such as Hemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae. Suspicion of meningitis is a medical emergency and immediate medical assessment is recommended. Current guidance in the United Kingdom {{is that if a}} case of meningococcal meningitis or septicaemia (infection of the blood) is suspected intravenous antibiotics should be given and the ill person admitted to the hospital. This means that laboratory tests may be less likely to confirm the presence of Neisseria meningitidis as the antibiotics will dramatically lower the number of bacteria in the body. The UK guidance is {{based on the idea that}} the reduced ability to identify the bacteria is outweighed by reduced chance of death.|$|E

25|$|HIV (human {{immunodeficiency}} virus) {{damages the}} body's immune system, which interferes with {{its ability to}} fight off disease-causing agents. The virus kills CD4 cells, which are white blood cells that help fight off various infections. HIV is carried in body fluids, and is spread by sexual activity. It can also be spread by contact with infected blood, breast feeding, childbirth, and from mother to child during pregnancy. When HIV is at its most advanced stage, an individual {{is said to have}} AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There are different stages of the progression of and HIV infection. The stages include primary infection, asymptomatic infection, symptomatic infection, and AIDS. In the primary infection stage, an individual will have flu like symptoms (headache, <b>fatigue,</b> <b>fever,</b> muscle aches) for about 2 weeks. In the asymptomatic stage, symptoms usually disappear, and the patient can remain asymptomatic for years. When HIV progresses to the symptomatic stage, the immune system is weakened, and has a low cell count of CD4+ T Cells. When the HIV infection becomes life-threatening, it is called AIDS. People with AIDS fall prey to opportunistic infections and die as a result. When the disease was first discovered in the 1980s, those who had AIDS were not likely to live longer than a few years. There are now antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) available to treat HIV infections. There is no known cure for HIV or AIDS but the drugs help suppress the virus. By suppressing the amount of virus in the body, people can lead longer and healthier lives. Even though their virus levels may be low they can still spread the virus to others.|$|E

2500|$|Eugene Aksenoff, a Tokyo-based {{physician}} who had treated Jackson {{and his children}} on a few occasions, expressed concern about Jackson's use of and interest in various drugs. Aksenoff said that Jackson asked for stimulants {{so that he could}} get through some demanding performances. He said he refused to prescribe them. He recalled that the singer suffered chronic <b>fatigue,</b> <b>fever,</b> insomnia and other symptoms and took a large amount of drugs. He suspected one of the major factors causing Jackson these symptoms was excessive use of steroids or other skin-whitening medications. According to the toxicological tests effectuated on Jackson's body, no addiction had been reported, and none of the experts called to testify at Murray's trial have identified the singer as a drug addict. Janet Jackson confirmed that the Jackson family tried to stage an intervention in early 2007, when Jackson was living in Las Vegas. Janet Jackson and some of her brothers allegedly traveled to his home, but were turned away by security guards who were ordered not to let them in. He was also rumored to have refused calls from his mother. [...] "If you tried to deal with him," [...] one family source said, [...] "he would shut you out. You just wouldn't hear from him for long periods." [...] The family denied that they had tried to intervene.|$|E
