25|$|Despite {{its heavy}} promotion, Diana's next album, Workin' Overtime, was a {{critical}} and commercial failure. Subsequent follow-ups such as The Force Behind the Power (1991), Take Me Higher (1995), and <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> New Day (1999) produced similarly disappointing sales.

500|$|In 1945, Tracy {{returned}} to {{the stage for the}} first time in 15 years. He had been through a dark patch personally—culminating with a stay in hospital—and Hepburn felt that a play would help restore his focus. Tracy told a journalist in April, [...] "I'm coming back to Broadway to see if I can still act." [...] The play was The Rugged Path by Robert E. Sherwood. It first previewed in Providence on September 28, to a sold out crowd and tepid response. It was a difficult production; director Garson Kanin later wrote: [...] "In the ten days prior to the New York opening all the important relationships had deteriorated. Spencer was tense and unbending, could not, or would not, take direction". Tracy considered leaving the show before it even opened on Broadway, and lasted there just six weeks before announcing his intention to close the show. It closed on January 19, 1946, after 81 performances. Tracy later explained to a friend: [...] "I couldn't say those goddamn lines over and over and over again every night... At least <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> new day for me in films... But this thing—every day, every day, over and over again." ...|$|E

2500|$|Her first book, Mankiller: A Chief and Her People, an autobiography, {{became a}} {{national}} bestseller. Gloria Steinem said in a review that, [...] "As one woman's journey, Mankiller opens the heart. As {{the history of a}} people, it informs the mind. Together, it teaches us that, as long as people like Wilma Mankiller carry the flame within them, centuries of ignorance and genocide can't extinguish the human spirit." [...] Steinem went on to become one of Mankiller's closest friends. In 2004, Mankiller co-authored <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> Good Day: Reflections by Contemporary Indigenous Women.|$|E

The series {{has been a}} critical success, with Mikkelsen's performance as Lecter earning praise. Mikkelsen was initially dubious about accepting the role, as he believed that Anthony Hopkins' portrayal of Lecter was [...] "done to perfection". He said of his character, [...] "He's not a classic psychopath or a classic serial killer. I believe that he's as close to Satan as can be – the fallen angel. He sees the beauty in death.

2500|$|Autism Speaks has {{produced}} three major films, each met with strong {{opposition from the}} Autistic community. Autism <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> documentary featuring interviews of parents with mostly negative opinions about autism and their situations. It has been criticized due to parents speaking about their children {{as if they are}} not there. [...] In one interview, former board member Alison Singer, mother of a daughter with autism, reveals she contemplated murder-suicide with her daughter in the same room. I Am Autism is a short video that personifies autism as a narrative voice, which compares itself to several diseases and makes the false claim of causing divorce. Sounding the Alarm is a documentary exploring the transition to adulthood and the cost of lifetime care. It was criticized for being [...] "full of dehumanizing rhetoric" [...] and portraying ignorance of nonverbal communication.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1998, Norwood {{released}} her second album Never Say Never. Boosted {{by the success}} of its number-one lead single [...] "The Boy Is Mine", a duet with singer Monica, it facilitated Norwood in becoming a viable recording artist with media–crossing appeal. In total, the album sold 16 million copies worldwide and spawned seven singles, including Norwood's second number-one song, the Diane Warren-penned [...] "Have You Ever?". Also in 1998, Norwood made her big screen debut in a supporting role in the slasher sequel, I Still Know What You Did Last Summer, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. The following year, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama Double Platinum about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter. Both Norwood and Ross served as executive producers of the movie which features original songs from Never Say Never and Ross's <b>Every</b> <b>Day</b> <b>Is</b> <b>a</b> New Day (1999).|$|E
2500|$|After {{backing out}} of a role in F.

The movie outperformed the original {{with a total of}} $16.5 million at its opening weekend, but critical reaction to the film was largely disappointing, with film review site Rotten Tomatoes calculating a poor rating of 7% based on 46 reviews. Norwood, however, earned positive reviews for her [...] "bouncy" [...] performance, which garnered her both a Blockbuster Entertainment Award and an MTV Movie Award nomination for Best Breakthrough Female Performance. In 1999, she co-starred with Diana Ross in the telefilm drama Double Platinum about an intense, strained relationship between a mother and daughter.

60|$|But {{there are}} some of you who believe not this--who think this cloud of life has no such close--that it is to float, {{revealed}} and illumined, upon the floor of heaven, in the day when He cometh with clouds, and every eye shall see Him. Some day, you believe, within these five, or ten, or twenty years, for every one of us the judgment will be set, and the books opened. If that be true, far more than that must be true. Is there but one day of judgment? Why, for us <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> day of judgment--every day is a Dies Irae, and writes its irrevocable verdict in the flame of its West. Think you that judgment waits till the doors of the grave are opened? It waits at the doors of your houses--it waits at the corners of your streets; {{we are in the midst}} of judgment--the insects that we crush are our judges--the moments we fret away are our judges--the elements that feed us, judge, as they minister--and the pleasures that deceive us, judge, as they indulge. Let us, for our lives, do the work of Men while we bear the form of them, if indeed those lives are NOT as a vapour, and do NOT vanish away.|$|E
6000|$|The {{streets are}} {{generally}} about {{wide enough for}} one wagon, and how they do swarm with people! It is Broadway repeated in every street, in every court, in every alley! Such masses, such throngs, such multitudes of hurrying, bustling, struggling humanity! We never saw the like of it, hardly even in New York, I think. There are seldom any sidewalks, and when there are, they are not often wide enough to pass a man on without caroming on him. So everybody walks in the street--and where the street is wide enough, carriages are forever dashing along. Why a thousand people are not run over and crippled <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mystery that no man can solve. But {{if there is an}} eighth wonder in the world, it must be the dwelling-houses of Naples. I honestly believe a good majority of them are a hundred feet high! And the solid brick walls are seven feet through. You go up nine flights of stairs before you get to the [...] "first" [...] floor. No, not nine, but there or thereabouts. There is a little bird-cage of an iron railing in front of every window clear away up, up, up, among the eternal clouds, where the roof is, and there is always somebody looking out of every window--people of ordinary size looking out from the first floor, people a shade smaller from the second, people that look a little smaller yet from the third--and from thence upward they grow smaller and smaller by a regularly graduated diminution, till the folks in the topmost windows seem more like birds in an uncommonly tall martin-box than any thing else. The perspective of one of these narrow cracks of streets, with its rows of tall houses stretching away till they come together in the distance like railway tracks; its clothes-lines crossing over at all altitudes and waving their bannered raggedness over the swarms of people below; and the white-dressed women perched in balcony railings {{all the way from the}} pavement up to the heavens--a perspective like that is really worth going into Neapolitan details to see.|$|E
