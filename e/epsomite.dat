Occupying a small, glacially-carved basin surrounded by mafic magnesian rocks, dolomites, and shales containing deposits of pyrite and pyrrholite minerals, Hot Lake is unusual among hypersaline lakes {{in that it}} is dominated by magnesium and sulfate as its major ions. Because of its mineralogy, Hot Lake was mined for <b>epsomite,</b> initially by the Stewart-Calvert Company during World War I, when the importation of <b>epsomite</b> from Germany was suspended.
