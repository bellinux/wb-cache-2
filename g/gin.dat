40|$|Cotton <b>ginning</b> {{workers have}} {{a risk of}} hearing loss due to {{excessive}} noise levels at the workplace environment. In this study, estimates of typical sound levels prevailing at the workplace environment {{and its effects on}} hearing ability of the exposed workers were made among cotton <b>ginning</b> workers. Data on self-reported health status was collected by a questionnaire survey at 10 cotton <b>ginning</b> industries located at Jalgaon district of Maharashtra state, India. The cotton <b>ginning</b> workers were exposed to continuous noise levels between 89 and 106 dBA. The hearing ability of the subjects was accessed by pure tone audiometry. The results of audiometry show mild, moderate and moderately severe degree of hearing impairment among the cotton <b>ginning</b> workers. The data generated during the study show that hearing loss was significantly associated with period of exposure to the workplace noise (P < 0. 0001). The prevalence of audiometric hearing impairment defined as a threshold average greater than 25 dB hearing level was 96 % for binaural low-frequency average, 97 % for binaural mid frequency average and 94 % for binaural high-frequency average in the cotton <b>ginning</b> workers. We recommend the compulsory use of personal protective equipment like ear plug by the cotton <b>ginning</b> workers at the workplace environment. A regular maintenance of <b>ginning</b> and pressing machineries will avoid the emission of excessive noise at the workplace environment of cotton <b>gins.</b> A regular periodic medical examination is necessary to measure the impact of workplace noise on the health of cotton <b>ginning</b> workers...|$|R

The cotton roller <b>ginning</b> process is the mechanical separation of cotton fibres from their seeds by means of one or more rollers to which fibres adhere while the seeds are impeded and struck off or pulled loose. Most of the cotton <b>ginning</b> operations are done using roller <b>gins.</b> The roller coverings contain about 18000 to 30000 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms which are toxic on human health. When the seed-cotton is <b>ginned,</b> the <b>ginned</b> lint cotton adsorbs with it about 140 to 1990 mg/kg (ppm) as total chromium of trivalent and hexavalent forms. Cotton dust is a good adsorbant of Cr (III) and Cr (VI) from chrome Specific Dust (CSD) being powdered during <b>ginning</b> operation.
