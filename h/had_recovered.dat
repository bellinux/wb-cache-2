5|$|Trapping resumed in the U.S. after 1962 once numbers <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> sufficiently. During {{the early}} 1970s, {{the value of}} fisher pelts soared, leading to another {{population}} crash in 1976. After {{a couple of years}} of closed seasons, fisher trapping re-opened in 1979 with a shortened season and restricted bag limits. The population has steadily increased since then, with steadily increasing numbers of trapped animals, despite a much lower pelt value.|$|E

5|$|After Olander, Williams, and Johnson <b>had</b> <b>recovered,</b> the six musicians {{set to work}} {{on their}} debut album. In doing so, Johnson soon {{discovered}} that the injuries to his hands had altered his dexterity on the mandolin, and threatened to walk away after Powell offhandedly remarked that he would have Roe dub in his own tenor harmonies instead of having Johnson sing them. The band also had commitments to finish as the Tennessee River Boys, {{to the point that they}} occasionally had to promote themselves under both names in the same day.|$|E

5|$|Armstrong <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from severe}} heart {{problems}} in the late 1970s, but by the mid-1980s he was experiencing rapidly declining health.

According to The Worldwide News, the official church newsletter, Armstrong told his advisory council on January 7, 1986, of his decision to appoint Tkach to succeed him {{in the event of}} his death. It was also announced by Armstrong in a letter to members of the church. Armstrong died on January 16, 1986, only nine days after naming his successor.|$|E
5|$|Both sides had injury {{concerns}} {{heading into}} the final. Liverpool defender Stéphane Henchoz was a doubt after he suffered a thigh injury in Liverpool's win over Auxerre. However, Liverpool midfielder Šmicer <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> from an ankle problem and would be available for selection. United {{had a number of}} injury concerns. Wes Brown, Scholes and Ryan Giggs were all doubts for the final, after they had picked up knocks in the week before the final. They would also be without striker Diego Forlán, who had injured his ankle against Juventus, however, defender Mikaël Silvestre was declared fit to start.|$|E
5|$|By mid-August 1942, Stanley <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> {{enough to}} be moved to the {{dysentery}} wing at Block 151 of Roberts Barracks.

So they {{asked him if he}} would do some paintings for St Luke's Chapel, which was recently converted from the ground floor of Block 151, near the area where Stanley was recuperating. The Chapel was dedicated to St Luke the Physician. Stanley agreed, and sought inspiration for the proposed paintings in the Gospels.|$|E

5|$|By mid-February, Morten <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> {{from his}} illness and resumed {{command of the}} {{battalion}} which, {{along with the rest}} of the division, was moved forward to the south of Cassino, taking over part of the sector of the U.S. 36th Infantry Division with the 6th Brigade in reserve. An initial attack on Cassino, which involved the 4th Indian Division, the 28th Maori Battalion and New Zealand engineers, was mounted on 15 February but failed due to a lack of air and armoured support. Two days later, the 5th Brigade attempted to capture the town's railway station but this too failed.|$|E
5|$|Chelsea centre back Frank Sinclair {{and left}} back Graeme Le Saux were both sidelined {{for the final}} due to their calf injuries, causing player-manager Vialli to swap them with Michael Duberry, and Danny Granville, who <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> from an abscess pain. Central midfielder Poyet was also {{included}} in the starting line-up to join captain Dennis Wise, after returning from a damaged cruciate ligament. Together with forward and lead goalscorer Vialli, Flo began in the attack, instead of Zola, who was named as a substitute, despite making an improvement from his damaged groin, sustained in a league fixture against Liverpool in April.|$|E
5|$|Defensively, Maryland {{was able}} to hold the nation's third-ranked rushing offense to just 114yards on the ground.

Two players made their first career interceptions: true freshman safety Kenny Tate and senior defensive back Jeff Allen. Tate's interception in the Maryland end zone prevented a Nevada score, while Allen's interception with 4:54remaining helped seal the victory for Maryland. Offensive lineman Scott Burley forced a fumble against Nevada linebacker Brandon Marshall, who <b>had</b> <b>recovered</b> a third-down fumble by Turner. Burley subsequently recovered the forced fumble and gave Maryland a first down.|$|E
