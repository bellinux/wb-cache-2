5|$|If any motion exists {{without a}} cause, then not every {{proposition}} will be either true or false. For {{that which has}} not efficient causes is neither true nor false. But every proposition is either true or false. Therefore, there is no motion without a cause. And if this <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> then all effects owe their existence to prior causes. And if this <b>is</b> <b>so,</b> all things happen by fate. It follows therefore that whatever happens, happens by fate.|$|E

5|$|The {{chemistry}} of hafnium and zirconium <b>is</b> <b>so</b> similar {{that the two}} cannot be separated {{on the basis of}} differing chemical reactions.

5|$|The overall cargo {{weight is}} the {{limiting}} {{factor in the}} design of an ore carrier, since the cargo <b>is</b> <b>so</b> dense. Coal carriers, on the other hand, are limited by overall volume, since most bulkers can be completely filled with coal before reaching their maximum draft.|$|E

5|$|As the {{treasurer}} of the riches of the world, Kubera is prescribed to be worshipped. Kubera also credited money to the god Venkateshwara (a form of the god Vishnu) for his marriage with Padmavati.
