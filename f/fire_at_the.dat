5|$|Horrocks was {{commissioned}} {{as a second}} lieutenant into the Middlesex Regiment on 8 August 1914. Horrocks, {{in charge of a}} draft of replacements, joined the 1st Battalion, Middlesex as part of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) during the BEF's retreat following its baptism of <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Mons. Horrocks was assigned to No. 16 Platoon, with Captain Gibbons as his company commander. The battalion was part of the 19th Independent Brigade, which was not assigned to a division. On 21 October, at the Battle of Armentières, his platoon was surrounded, and he was wounded and taken prisoner.|$|E

5|$|Lariboisière's {{direction}} of artillery <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Battle of Austerlitz {{resulted in the}} destruction of the ice covering the lake over which Russian army forces retreated. His placement of artillery at the Battle of Borodino gave the French a tactical advantage in fire on the Russian lines. Lariboisière's artillery also provided the rear guard coverage of the French withdrawal from Beresina. One of his sons survived the wars and the family founded the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris.|$|E

During the firefight, Abdul Rashid Ghazi {{was shot in}} the leg and was asked to surrender. However, militants in the room fired back at the SSG, and Ghazi was killed in the crossfire. Other reports say that Ghazi came out of a bunker to surrender, only to be shot by his own forces. The fighting continued until all the personnel trapped in the basement either surrendered or were killed.|$|E
5|$|On October 10, the Americans {{spotted a}} large house in Yorktown. Believing that Cornwallis might be {{stationed}} there, they aimed {{at it and}} quickly destroyed it. Cornwallis sank {{more than a dozen}} of his ships in the harbor. The French began to <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> British ships and scored a hit on the British HMS Charon, which caught fire, and in turn set two or three other ships on fire. Cornwallis received word from Clinton that the British fleet was to depart on October 12, however Cornwallis responded by saying {{that he would not be}} able to hold out for long.|$|E

Fireworks were being discharged {{at the other end of}} the village. All that remained were burnt beams and smouldering walls, which were apparently made of old fen-mud. The villagers saved the nearby Three Horseshoes public house, by forming a bucket chain, and pouring water on its thatched roof.|$|E

They were joined by Sergeant First Class Jerod Staidle, the platoon sergeant, and Specialist Gary Depriest, a medic. Directing the medic to treat Gathercole, Petry was assisted by Staide and Higgins to the casualty collection point.|$|E

Former KGB agent Victor Sheymov testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen.|$|E
5|$|The deadliest fire in Davenport history came on January 7, 1950, when 41 {{people were}} killed in a <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> St. Elizabeth's Hospital, a mental ward {{operated}} by Mercy Hospital. Most of the people who lost their lives were female patients trapped behind windows locked shut by rusty, iron bars.

5|$|The main attack, {{from the}} north and east, was to be made by the New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade, {{commanded}} by Brigadier General Edward Chaytor, which moved in line of troop columns. The New Zealanders were supported by a machine gun squadron armed with Vickers and Lewis guns, and the 3rd Light Horse Brigade all under the command of Chaytor. This attack began near the village of Magdhaba and the Wadi El Arish, on the virtually featureless battleground, when the British Empire artillery opened <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> same time as Chaytor's group moved towards the Ottoman garrison's right and rear.|$|E

5|$|A severe <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Grand Central {{station on}} April 21, 1964, {{destroyed}} the demonstration train and manual operation had been restored since. The fire began under a shuttle train on track 3, {{and it became}} larger, feeding on the wooden platform. The train on Track 1 was saved when the motorman saw smoke, and reversed the train. The basements of nearby buildings were damaged. Tracks 1 and 4 returned to service on April 23, 1964, while Track 3 returned to service on June 1, 1964. The reinstallation of Track 3 was delayed {{because of the need}} to replace 60 beams that were damaged in the fire. Initially, a decision was not made concerning whether or not the automated shuttle train should be reintroduced.|$|E

5000|$|Several groups {{maintain}} {{there is}} great room for improvement in non-lethal weapons and procedures for their use. Claims for the relative safety of such weapons are usually contingent on their being used [...] "properly".

5|$|Admiral Sir Roger Curtis, 1st Baronet, GCB (4 June 1746 – 14 November 1816) was {{an officer}} of the British Royal Navy, who saw action in several battles during an {{extensive}} career that was punctuated by a number of highly controversial incidents. Curtis served during the American Revolutionary War and the French Revolutionary Wars and was highly praised in the former conflict for his bravery under <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Great Siege of Gibraltar, where he saved several hundred Spanish lives at great risk to his own. His career suffered however {{in the aftermath of the}} Glorious First of June, when he was heavily criticised for his conduct by several influential figures, including Cuthbert Collingwood. His popularity fell further due to his involvement in two highly controversial courts-martial, those of Anthony Molloy in 1795 and James Gambier in 1810.|$|E
5|$|After Shirley had {{returned}} home that afternoon, the mob, which had seized another naval officer and several petty officers, {{returned to his}} house. Shirley ordered a number of armed men who were protecting his house to <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> mob, but William Pepperrell was able to stop Shirley's men from firing and to persuade the mob to leave. In the meantime, Commodore Knowles threatened to bombard Boston with his squadron. It was only after the Massachusetts Council adopted resolutions {{in support of the}} demands of the mob that the situation became quieter in Boston. The mob eventually released its hostages and Knowles released the impressed seamen.|$|E
5|$|An {{example of}} the urge to {{identify}} scapegoats for the fire is {{the acceptance of the}} confession of a simple-minded French watchmaker named Robert Hubert, who claimed that he was an agent of the Pope and had started the Great Fire in Westminster. He later changed his story to say that he had started the <b>fire</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bakery in Pudding Lane. Hubert was convicted, despite some misgivings about his fitness to plead, and hanged at Tyburn on 28 September 1666. After his death, it became apparent that he had been on board a ship in the North Sea, and had not arrived in London until two days after the fire started. These allegations that Catholics had started the fire were exploited as powerful political propaganda by opponents of pro-Catholic Charles II's court, mostly during the Popish Plot and the exclusion crisis later in his reign.|$|E
