50|$|A In-arrears swap is an {{interest}} rate swap that sets (fixes) the interest rate and pays the interest {{at the end of}} the coupon period. In contrast, a standard swap sets the interest rate in advance, at the beginning of the coupon period, and pays the <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> {{at the end of the}} coupon period. The same distinction holds for other interest rate derivatives, e.g. caps, floors and swaptions.|$|E
5000|$|When a {{borrower}} makes a Pay-Option ARM payment that is {{less than}} the accruing interest, there is [...] "negative amortization", which means that the unpaid portion of the accruing interest is added to the outstanding principal balance. For example, if the borrower makes a minimum payment of $1,000 and the ARM has accrued monthly <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> of $1,500, $500 will be added to the borrower's loan balance. Moreover, the next month's interest-only payment will be calculated using the new, higher principal balance.|$|E
50|$|Even when paid, the {{interest}} payment was late (Spain defaulted on its loans several times). In 1564, Spain paid 300,000 ducats representing <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b> The sum was paid in silver thalers and half-thalers minted in Naples and Sicily. At the time, Poland-Lithuania was engulfed in the Livonian and Northern Seven Years' Wars and was short on cash. To {{save time and}} money, the received coins were not melted and re-minted. Instead, they were counterstamped with a monogram of Sigismund Augustus and the year (1564) in Vilnius Mint. These coins were mandatorily exchanged for 60 Polish groszes when in reality the coins were worth only about 33.5 groszes. The King promised to redeem the coins {{at the end of}} the war at the same rate of 60 groszes (thus, in effect, providing a wartime loan to the state). It is unknown if the promise was kept. These countersigned coins are numismatic rarity in Poland and Lithuania.|$|E
25|$|The {{effective}} interest rate, effective annual interest rate, annual equivalent rate (AER) {{or simply}} effective rate is {{the interest rate}} on a loan or financial product restated from the nominal interest rate as an interest rate with annual compound <b>interest</b> payable <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b>|$|R

Where rent is due yearly, at least three months' rent must be <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> by more than three months.|$|R

Nauru has alternated between special and full membership since joining the Commonwealth, depending on its financial situation.|$|R
5000|$|Three major {{financial}} and policy {{criticisms of the}} Act (for both then and into the present day) were: (1) the passage of Act, to raise federal revenue and to refund the debt (of the States and their Confederation), wrongly, artificially, and unnecessarily raised {{the value of the}} debt being assumed by the Federal Government (in most cases far beyond the market value of those debts (in disregard of the unnecessary increase in the costs of this action to the Treasury, and ultimately, US Taxpayers); (2) full assumption (done in the way that it was) was a [...] "windfall" [...] to the stock jobber merchant class of financial (soon to be known as Wall Street speculators), who reaped (personally as a class) enormous unearned and windfall profits, for no work and no risk of their capital invested; (3) small share investors who had purchased the States' bonded debts originally realized none of the windfall of the US Government's policy choice for [...] "Full Assumption". The windfall value was on average; for debt principal: five and one-half times; and, for <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> by three times.|$|E

40|$|We will {{investigate}} valuation of derivatives with payoff {{defined as a}} nonlinear though close to linear function of tradable underlying assets. Derivatives involving Libor or swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> i. e. rates paid in a wrong time, are a typical example. It is generally tempting to replace the future unknown interest rates with the forward rates. We will show rigorously that indeed this is not possible {{in the case of}} Libor or swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b> We will introduce formally the notion of plain vanilla derivatives as those that can be replicated by a finite set of elementary operations and show that derivatives involving the rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears</b> are not plain vanilla. We will also study the issue of valuation of such derivatives. Beside the popular convexity adjustment formula, we will develop an improved two or more variable adjustment formula applicable in particular on swap rates <b>in</b> <b>arrears.</b> Finally, we will get a precise fully analytical formula based on the usual assumption of log-normality of the relevant tradable underlying assets applicable to a wide class of convexity related derivatives. We will illustrate the techniques and different results on a case study of a real life controversial exotic swap. interest rate derivatives, Libor <b>in</b> <b>arrears,</b> constant maturity swap, valuation models, convexity adjustment...|$|R

We conclude that the mortgage arrears problem exerts a significant drag on aggregate consumption in the economy. ...|$|R
