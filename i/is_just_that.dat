25|$|The {{problem with}} this kind of {{argument}} <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that,</b> in defining the meaning of what is happening in society, {{it is very difficult to}} provide definite scientific proof that this meaning is the objective truth. It remains an interpretation, which may make sense of things at a certain level, without providing the whole truth. Engels's comment illustrates that the concept of character masks is not infrequently used in a polemical way to describe a false or inauthentic representation.|$|E

No one will mistake the episode {{for one of the}} series' greats, but at least the characters start to resemble the ones we'd come to know later. In addition, it tosses out just enough humor to make it enjoyable." [...] David Sims of The A.V. Club gave the episode a B+, saying, [...] "It's a pretty funny episode– my main criticism <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> at this point, Kramer isn't integrated at all into the stories, rather he just comes by and dispenses weird dialog for a couple minutes." ...|$|E

500|$|The film's main theme {{shows the}} effect that {{coincidence}} and chance can have on the course of life—like the bad weather, angry dog, hungry goats, slippery planks, and careless postman that {{change the course of}} both Kaspar's and Ingeborg's lives—and shows, as the film's website states, that [...] "seemingly unrelated factors might play important roles in the big scheme of things after all." [...] In an interview, Kove said that [...] "what I'm trying to get across <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> I think life is really a kind of a meandering journey... a lot is really up to chance".

500|$|Plath's fellow confessional {{poet and}} friend Anne Sexton commented: [...] "Sylvia and I would talk {{at length about}} our first suicide, in detail and in depth—between the free potato chips. Suicide is, after all, the {{opposite}} of the poem. Sylvia and I often talked opposites. We talked death with burned-up intensity, both of us drawn to it like moths to an electric lightbulb, sucking on it. She told the story of her first suicide in sweet and loving detail, and her description in The Bell Jar <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> same story." [...] The confessional interpretation of Plath's work has led to some dismissing certain aspects of her work as an exposition of sentimentalist melodrama; in 2010, for example, Theodore Dalrymple asserted that Plath had been the [...] "patron saint of self-dramatization" [...] and of self-pity. Revisionist critics such as Tracy Brain have, however, argued against a tightly autobiographical interpretation of Plath's material.|$|E
500|$|The {{majority}} of the album's lyrics discuss political issues in the United States. Jeff Miers of The Buffalo News calls the album [...] "a response to the oppressive vacuousness of the Bush years". Dealing with specific tracks on the album, AllMusic states that Rise Against [...] "rages against the moral decay rotting {{the core of the}} U.S. on the opening 'Collapse (Post-Amerika),' just as they strike out against the slow dumbing down of America on 'Re-Education (Through Labor)'". In addition to political topics, more personal issues constitute {{a large portion of the}} lyrical content. [...] "Savior" [...] is about forgiveness and broken relationships, while [...] "The Dirt Whispered" [...] is about the need to sacrifice for what a person loves. Bassist Joe Principe said, [...] "The political side of this band <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> -- it's a side. There are political lyrics. There are social awareness and there are lyrics about the environment. I think if people take the time to read the lyrics, they'll know we're not strictly force feeding you our politics." ...|$|E

500|$|A printed inverted-F antenna can be {{implemented}} in the classic inverted-F shape, usually {{to one side of}} the circuit board where the ground plane has been removed from underneath the antenna. [...] However, another approach is a modified patch antenna, the shorted patch antenna. [...] In this approach, one edge of the patch, or some intermediate point, is grounded with grounding pins or vias through to the ground plane. [...] This works on the same principle as an inverted-F; viewed sideways, the F shape can be seen, it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> the antenna element is very wide in the horizontal plane. [...] The shorted patch antenna has a wider bandwidth than the thin line type due to the greater radiation area. [...] Like the thin line type, the shorted patch antenna can be printed on the same printed circuit board as the rest of the circuitry. [...] However, they are commonly printed on to their own board, or on to a dielectric fixed to the main board. [...] This is done so that the antenna, can be suspended and effectively be in air dielectric, is a greater distance from the ground plane than it would otherwise be, or the dielectric used is a more suitable material for RF performance.|$|E
500|$|According to a Metro publication, [...] "Something New" [...] had a {{generally}} positive reaction from fans. Susana Novo Vásquez of The Huffington Post stated that [...] "the indisputable team of Xenomania/Girls Aloud {{have been the}} ones to set the trends over the years for others to follow," [...] adding that the song [...] "continues down that path." [...] Vásquez continued saying that the group returned into a moment where the [...] "pop scene ... isn't the same as when they left," [...] but {{thought that they were}} [...] "doing it in a very intelligent way: by adopting some of the Calvin Harris electronic massive sound that is current right now, yet creating an intricate song structure." [...] Robert Copsey of Digital Spy said that [...] "like most Girls Aloud singles, a few listens are required to get our heads around it." [...] Copsey criticized the distorted vocals and the fact that [...] "there probably won't be a full album of new tracks to accompany it," [...] but admitted that [...] "it sounds modern enough for today's charts without compromising their signature sound" [...] and praised its [...] "massive chorus." [...] Douglas Wolk of Pitchfork Media thought that the track [...] "is a game approximation of the Girls Aloud of seven years ago," [...] while BBC Music reviewer Ian Wade concluded that, [...] "as its title suggests, Something New <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that,</b> a fanfare-like call to arms announcing the group’s return." ...|$|E
500|$|Cogman noted, {{about the}} Arya storyline {{in the same}} interview, that {{he comes from a}} theater background, and that [...] "being able to comment on the show and the {{reactions}} to the show through the players were so much fun. The show is often accused of being gratuitous in all kinds of way – the violence and the bigness of the characters. It's a huge operatic story. We're able to lovingly spoof ourselves but also play with ideas about how audiences view the show, good and bad, and how a perspective of a story changes. Plus there’s the dramatic deliciousness of Arya watching her own life play out on stage." [...] Weiss also spoke about Arya, saying [...] "We were excited to do the play within the play, and it's a distorted fun house mirror representation of things we've already seen." [...] Benioff continued, [...] "Part of Arya's amusement <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that</b> she knows that they're getting so many details wrong, but she always regretted that she didn't have a chance to watch Joffrey die, and now she gets to. It's obviously a comic version of it, but that gives her great pleasure." [...] Weiss also noted, [...] "Arya is slowly getting seduced by these performances, and Lady Crane, the actress that she's charged with killing, this is somebody who like her has taken as her life's work the job of becoming other people." ...|$|E

[...] The review continued: [...] "Every number is so outstanding {{that it is difficult to}} decide which will be the most popular." [...] The review in New York World-Telegram found the show to be [...] "the ultimate modern blending of music and popular theatre to date, with the finest kind of balance between story and song, and hilarity and heartbreak." [...] Brooks Atkinson of The New York Times especially praised Pinza's performance: [...] "Mr. Pinza's bass voice is the most beautiful that has been heard on a Broadway stage for an eon or two. He sings... with infinite delicacy of feeling and loveliness of tone." [...] He declared that [...] "Some Enchanted Evening", sung by Pinza, [...] "ought to become reasonably immortal." [...] Richard Watts, Jr. of the New York Post focused on Mary Martin's performance, writing, [...] "nothing I have ever seen her do prepared me for the loveliness, humor, gift for joyous characterization, and sheer lovableness of her portrayal of Nellie Forbush... who is so shocked to find her early racial prejudices cropping up. Hers is a completely irresistible performance." ...|$|E
500|$|Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama {{gave the}} film 4 (out of 5) stars, {{saying that it}} was [...] "attention-grabbing from {{inception}} till conclusion. The drama only soars higher and the complex love story gets more and more gripping as the conflict between the characters come to the fore." [...] Rachit Gupta of Filmfare gave it 4 (out of 5) stars: [...] "At a gracious 3 hours runtime, JTHJ feels like an epic love story. And it <b>is</b> <b>just</b> <b>that.</b> JTHJ is the perfect adieu to a hallmark career. It is the best romantic film made in this generation." [...] Saibal Chatterjee of NDTV gave it 3.5 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Despite the lovey-dovey nothingness that drives the plot, Jab Tak Hai Jaan has more substance than most romantic films that come out of Bollywood." [...] Meena Iyer of The Times of India rated it 3.5 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "Every frame is picture-perfect, the emotions are well nuanced. But there is one inherent flawthe story by Aditya Chopra is hackneyed." [...] Subhash Jha (also from The Times of India) said, [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan makes {{you fall in love with}} love all over again." [...] Anupama Chopra of the Hindustan Times gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "Jab Tak Hai Jaan is too tangled to transport you. But I recommend that you see it. Because only Yash Chopra could make heartache so attractive and ennobling that his characters wear it like a badge of honor." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "I'm going with three out of five for the late Yash Chopra's Jab Tak Hai Jaan. Despite its many script problems, it's a consistently watchable film that oozes with feeling and real emotion. A fitting swan song." [...] OPEN magazine gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars, praising Yash Chopra's direction. Ajit Duara called it [...] "a deeply-felt cinematic perspective from 80 years of living." [...] Raja Sen of Rediff.com gave it 3 (out of 5) stars, saying: [...] "As a swan-song for the master director, Jab Tak Hai Jaan might only be a middling effort. But then, sometimes, all we need is a Khan-song." [...] Shabana Ansari of Daily News and Analysis gave the film 3 (out of 5) stars: [...] "If you must, watch Jab Tak Hai Jaan for Shah Rukh, who can still convey love and passion in a fleeting look or a dimpled smile; and for Yash Chopra who gave us some of the most enduring romances of all times." ...|$|E
