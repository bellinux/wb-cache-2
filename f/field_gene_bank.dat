The globe artichoke is the fourth most important horticultural crop in Europe. Here, we report the results of a molecular analysis of a collection including globe artichoke and leafy cardoon germplasm present in the Italian, French and Spanish <b>gene</b> <b>banks.</b> The aims of this study were to: (i) assess the diversity present in European collections, (ii) determine the population structure, (iii) measure the genetic distance between accessions; (iv) cluster the accessions; (v) properly distinguish accessions present in the different national collections carrying the same name; and (vi) understand the diversity distribution in relation to the <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> and the geographic origin of the germplasm. A total of 556 individuals grouped into 174 accessions of distinct typologies were analyzed by different types of molecular markers, i. e. dominant (ISSR and AFLP) and co-dominant (SSR). The data of the two crops (globe artichoke and leafy cardoon) were analyzed jointly and separately to compute, among other aims, the gene diversity, heterozygosity (He, Ho), fixation indexes, AMOVA, genetic distance and structure. The findings underline the huge diversity present in the analyzed material, and the existence of alleles that are able to discriminate among accessions.

40|$|Pistachio (Pistacia vera L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{promising}} nut trees in the Central and West Asia region due to its high nutritional and medicinal value. It is a major crop which contributes to the economy and nutrition of many poor communities in the region. The pistachio crop currently depends on a very narrow genetic base and this constitutes a serious threat to the sustainability of pistachio production in this region. Also traditional cultivars are increasingly being replaced by few improved types in areas of greatest diversity, while the destruction of natural habitats by deforestation, overgrazing, over cutting, and man–made fires contributes to further the loss of wild species. Syria is considered as a center of origin for some Pistacia species. Wild species such as P. atlantica, P. palaestina, P. Khinjuk, and P. terebinthus constitute an important source of genetic diversity for the Pistachio crop. These wild relatives together with local varieties of Pistacia vera form the total Pistacia genetic resources in Syria, which should be maintained for sustainable pistachio cultivation. Further Syria has about 25 cultivated varieties distinguished by morphological traits. The Pistachio species can be found growing in private farms, forests, national protected areas and national and international <b>field</b> <b>gene</b> <b>banks.</b> Although, Syria is classified as the fourth pistachio producing country in the world, it holds some unique diversity not found elsewhere. Pistachio is a major cash commodity in Iran, Turkey, Syria, Afghanistan and Central Asia on the other hand it could be considered as a neglected and under utilized genetic resources having high income potential. On the other hand, the pure stand of the P. vera in central Asia, center of origin, makes the area a valuable source of the genetic diversity but unfortunately a severe forest degradation affected these population. The purpose of this research is to assess the level of diversity of the Pistacia gene pool conserved in both ex situ and in situ/on farm in Syria, Uzbekistan and Tajikistan using molecular techniques in order to better understand the genetic structure, pattern and distribution of diversity within ex situ collections and in the wild and to develop a complementary conservation and use strategy for pistachio. This research was carried out during 2004 - 2006. In this study, the distribution and diversity conservation of cultivated and wild populations of Pistacia species in the Central and West Asia have been examined. A based ecogeographic survey was first undertaken to determine the distribution of the different Pistacia genus in Central and West Asia, principally in Syria, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan. Fifty four sites were chosen to represent the distribution of these species and to collect the plant material in order to be characterized and evaluated. Then several visits were paid these sites, the results of this study showed that the Pistacia genus was found in different climatic areas ranged from dry up to humid areas. These results indicate the pistachio is a drought resistant tree and flourishing in arid and semi-arid zones. Pistacia genus were found in a margin areas with wide range of soils, especially in those very shallow, moderately developed, non-acid with clay-enriched subsoil, and also on no significant soil profile development or poorly developed soils of semi-deserts. All surveyed accessions were thoroughly studied to assess their morphological variability. Characters related to the tree growth, leaves, nuts, were among those considered during these evaluations. The Descriptor Lists produced by IPGRI (1997; 1998) were adopted in these activities. The results pf this studied showed a highly significant variability between and within these species, due to there environmental conditions. AFLP, ISSR, SSR molecular analyses and multivariate (Factor Analysis Principal Component) and cluster analysis showed a large amount of variability both within and between species in the wild populations of Pistacia in this region. The correlations between the data of these three molecular markers techniques were either significant or highly significant. This study confirms that P. terebinthus and P.  palaestina had a close relationship with all Molecular techniques applied which is adopted the opinion of being P. palaestina as subspecies of P. terebinthus. On the other hand the principle component analysis found that these species could be clustered in three main groups, first with P. atlantica and P.  khinjuk, the second contained the wild and cultivated P. vera and the third groups contained P. palaestina and P. terebinthus. While P. lentiscus the only evergreen species never grouped with any of the pervious groups. The data obtained from the ecogeogarphic survey were compared with those of each molecular marker technique, the results found the existence of significant correlations between the climate and the molecular marker data which are applied on Pistacia species ranged between highly significant with Pistacia vera case with all markers or significant and not correlated in other species and markers. The quantitive morphological characters of leaves and nuts were also compared with the molecular markers data for male and female groups in each site. The results showed that there are no correlations between the leaves and leaflets dimensions and any of the used molecular marker techniques with any molecular marker technique, with some exception for SSR technique and the nut dimensions in P. palaestina and P.  terebinthus, which were significantly correlated. Finally this study discussed a suggested complementary conservation strategy according to the results obtained from this study and the possibilities available in these countries. Four possible conservation methods were being most recommended according to the conditions of the Pistacia genus. Two ex situ conservation methods which are conventional seed storage and <b>field</b> <b>gene</b> <b>banks</b> are the most suitable ways to conserve the Pistacia spp. On the other hand, Biosphere reserves or protected areas and on farm conservation are the most convenient in situ conservations for these species. The combination of these four methods would overpass the disadvantage of some of them such as the static conservation of the seed storage or the possible loss of the diversity in the cultivated pistachio if the on-farm conservation was involved.

50|$|Piper ribesioides is {{a lesser}} known woody species known {{to occur in}} Myanmar, Andaman-Nicobar Islands, and Malesia. This taxon is located from the Andaman Islands in 1834 by Dr Helfer. He was a {{geologist}} who made extensive botanical collections from Tenasserim (Myanmar) and Andaman Islands. Unfortunately, he was murdered by the aborigines of northern Andaman Islands and his all collections from Tenasserim and Andaman Islands got mixed up causing much confusion about the geographical origin of the botanical collections. Hence the locality of all herbarium collections made by Helfer have been designated as Tenasserim/Andaman Islands. Exact occurrence of several collections made by Helfer was later reconfirmed by other botanists during their explorations. One of his collections deposited at Central National Herbarium, Howrah (CAL) designated the locality as Tenasserim/Andaman Islands was Piper ribesioides; however, the occurrence of this species in Andaman Islands was doubted until its rediscovery in 1990 by Mathew and Abraham.

Visualizing need for location specific high yielding cultivars in the region, the programme on genetic resource management in litchi was initiated at the ICAR Research Complex for Eastern Region, Research Centre, Ranchi (formerly Horticulture and Agro-forestry Research Programme, Ranchi) {{in the very first}} year of its establishment. Efforts on collection and conservation of germplasm have resulted in augmentation of 53 genotypes in the <b>field</b> <b>gene</b> <b>bank.</b> Out of them, 17 genotypes which have attained full bearing potential have been characterized based on 83 characters (Tree characters- 12, Leaf characters- 20, Inflorescence characters- 12, Fruit characters- 31, Seed characters- 9, Growing Degree Days requirement). Classification of genotypes through D 2 -analysis based on leaf biochemical characters like total free amino acid, total phenol, total soluble protein and total carbohydrate was found to be insufficient, although the method holds promise by inclusion of more number of biochemical parameters. Studies on genetic variability among the genotypes indicated that characters like ascorbic acid content, seed and peel weights and their percentage, peel thickness, seed shape index and seed volume had high heritability as well as high genetic advance. And hence are governed by additive gene action. Stability analysis of economically important traits indicated that stable varieties Rose Scented can be a source for improvement of yield, tree girth and fruit length while Purbi can be source for improvement in fruit weight and fruit diameter in addition to plant yield and tree girth. Changes in yield pattern of different varieties indicated yield stabilization after 20 years. Based on performance evaluation of different genotypes, the litchi cv.

40|$|Aibika or Abelmoschus manihot {{as it is}} scientifically {{known is}} the most popular and commonly-consumed {{indigenous}} green leafy vegetable in Papua New Guinea (PNG). Many different varieties of aibika {{can be found in the}} country and the PNG National Agricultural Research Institute (NARI) is overseeing the collection and maintenance of these varieties in a <b>field</b> <b>gene</b> <b>bank</b> at Laloki, PNG. At this stage the accessions have only been morphologically characterised and there is no data on genetic differences between the accessions. Over twenty different varieties of aibika were imported into Sydney over a three year period. The two (2) main objectives for this study were: Firstly to determine the extent of genetic diversity between the accessions with the aim of assisting PNGNARI in identifying core genotypes in the current collection which would aid its effective management. Second aim was to analyse micronutrients (total folate and minerals) in all accessions and identify any relationships between the nutrient contents and genotypes. It is known that micronutrients do vary within varieties of same species so that the identification of a nutrient rich variety or varieties would lead to its promotion and consumption by the local communities. Genetic variation was determined using the techniques of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and directed amplification of minisatellite region DNA (DAMD). Two chloroplast DNA regions, the psbM-trnD and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer regions, as well as the nuclear encoded ITS region were also studied to determine if genetic variation could be found among the accessions of aibika. Mineral analysis was performed using ICPOES whilst for the folate, the extract was tri-enzyme treated and analysed using the Vitafast® folic acid kit. Total folate contents ranged from 34 – 132 µg/ 100 g on a fresh weight basis over two years indicating a wide range and a significant difference (p< 0. 05) between the two years. The mineral contents (mg/ 100 g fresh weight) were in the following ranges for the 3 year period; iron, 0. 8 – 8. 7; zinc, 0. 32 – 2. 31; calcium, 197 – 635; potassium, 265 – 630; sodium, 1. 0 – 41; magnesium, 79 - 264; manganese, 0. 42 – 2. 09 and copper, 0. 13 – 1. 7. A significant (p< 0. 05) variation in the mineral contents was observed reflecting on variations in growing conditions between the collections. UPGMA analysis of the bands generated by RAPD and DAMD techniques classified the 23 morphologically different accessions of aibika into five main groups. The sequencing results showed no difference between the accessions at the psbM-trnD and the trnL-trnF intergenic spacer regions. In the ITS region, sequences from all accessions were identical with the exception of LAL AM 221 where the sequence data from the reverse primer suggested that there were 11 differences from the rest of the accessions, data from this sequence was submitted to Genbank (KC 48173). UPGMA clustering of accessions based on micronutrient data showed variations from year to year. Aibika is a good source of folate and the minerals studied. There was no significant effect of genotype on micronutrient content in all accessions.
