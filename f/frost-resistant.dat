5|$|The genus, though, is very {{variable}} {{in terms of}} habitat. Individual sundew species have adapted {{to a wide variety}} of environments, including atypical habitats, such as rainforests, deserts (D. burmannii and D. indica), and even highly shaded environments (Queensland sundews). The temperate species, which form hibernacula in the winter, are examples of such adaptation to habitats; in general, sundews tend to inhabit warm climates, and are only moderately <b>frost-resistant.</b>|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of stone runs occur in England, most notably at the Stiperstones, Shropshire. They are also known in Pennsylvania. Small examples are probably very widespread where solifluction deposits contain large concentrations of <b>frost-resistant</b> rock blocks.|$|E
25|$|Finland's {{climate and}} soils make growing crops a {{particular}} challenge. The country lies between 60° and 70° north latitude - {{as far north}} as Alaska - and has severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frosts. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, and because of the relatively low elevation of the land area, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and <b>frost-resistant</b> varieties of crops. Most farmland had originally been either forest or swamp, and the soil had usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralise excess acid and to develop fertility. Irrigation was generally not necessary, but drainage systems were often needed to remove excess water.|$|E
2500|$|Senecio vulgaris is a <b>frost-resistant</b> {{deciduous}} annual {{plant that}} grows in disturbed sites, waste places, roadsides, gardens, nurseries, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, agricultural lands, at altitudes up to [...] and is, additionally, self-pollinating producing 1,700 seeds per plant with three generations per year. Seeds are dispersed by wind and also cling to clothing and animal fur, and as contaminates of commercially exchanged seeds; {{the distribution of}} this plant throughout {{the world has been}} difficult if not impossible to contain.|$|E
6000|$|By {{this time}} the {{sunshine}} was pouring in through the screening and across the bed. On {{the outside of the}} wire screen clung a number of house-flies, early-hatched for the season and numb with the night's cold. As Forrest ate he watched the hunting of the meat-eating yellow- jackets. Sturdy, more <b>frost-resistant</b> than bees, they were already on the wing and preying on the benumbed flies. Despite the rowdy noise of their flight, these yellow hunters of the air, with rarely ever a miss, pounced on their helpless victims and sailed away with them. The last fly was gone ere Forrest had sipped his last sip of coffee, marked [...] "Commercial Breeding of Frogs" [...] with a match, and taken up his proofsheets.|$|E
50|$|Under cultivation, {{it can be}} pruned after {{flowering}} {{to encourage}} a bushy shape. It is <b>frost-resistant.</b>|$|E
50|$|Monanthes are not <b>frost-resistant.</b> They {{are linked}} with the genera Sempervivum, Greenovia, Aichryson and Aeonium, which is obvious from their similar flowers.|$|E
50|$|The {{species of}} Aichryson are not <b>frost-resistant.</b> They {{are related to}} Sempervivum, Jovibarba, Greenovia, Aeonium and Monanthes, readily seen in their similar flowers.|$|E
5000|$|Bunchosia pallescens Skottsb. [...] - [...] usuma or bush tomato paste. A fast-growing, <b>frost-resistant</b> {{species that}} {{produces}} Autumn berries of little pulp but pleasant tomato paste flavour.|$|E
50|$|Nemoral (pertaining to groves or woodland) biome zones {{according}} to the Walter classification system have a moderate temperate climate with short frost periods and are characterized by <b>frost-resistant</b> broadleaved deciduous forests.|$|E
50|$|Other {{examples}} of stone runs occur in England, most notably at the Stiperstones, Shropshire. They are also known in Pennsylvania. Small examples are probably very widespread where solifluction deposits contain large concentrations of <b>frost-resistant</b> rock blocks.|$|E
50|$|This {{variety is}} little known in cultivation. It is {{suggested}} that cultivation requirements {{would be similar to}} the better-known B. sessilis var. sessilis. Despite being a coastal plant, it has been reported as being <b>frost-resistant</b> down to -7°C.|$|E
50|$|Central Europe was unforested at this time, {{except for}} local wooded areas of steppe and tundra which {{were covered by}} <b>frost-resistant</b> birch and pine. The {{vegetation}} of this period {{is referred to as}} Dryas flora, after its flagship species, the mountain avens (Dryas octopetala).|$|E
5000|$|Ulmus ''''Nanguen'''' (selling name [...] ) is {{a complex}} fourth {{generation}} hybrid cultivar from the cross 'Plantyn' × ('Bea Schwarz' selfed), an ancestry comprising four field elms (U. minor), a wych elm (U. glabra), the curious Exeter Elm ('Exoniensis'), and a <b>frost-resistant</b> selection of the Himalayan elm (U. wallichiana).|$|E
50|$|Although their {{subtropical}} cousins {{are very}} frost-sensitive, sempervivums {{are among the}} most <b>frost-resistant</b> succulents, making them popular garden plants. They tend to grow best in dry conditions with well-draining, sandy soil to prevent soggy roots. They require only moderate watering, especially during warmer months, with occasional protection from extreme sun exposure.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, it {{has been}} {{observed}} that the Spanish slug has bred with the indigenous black slug Arion ater to produce a more <b>frost-resistant</b> variety in the more northerly regions. Danish authorities maintain that the Spanish slug, black slug and red slug are in fact subspecies of the same species.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{lives in}} the cold boreal climate on moist soils in {{mountains}} or river basins at elevations of 1900 - 2400 m. It is very shade-tolerant, <b>frost-resistant,</b> and hardy, surviving temperatures down to −50 °C. It rarely lives over 200 years due to the susceptibility to fungal decay in the wood.|$|E
50|$|Kunzea 'Badja Carpet' is commercially available, {{having been}} {{registered}} with the Australian Cultivar Registration Authority (ACRA) in 1979 after successful propagation at the Australian National Botanic Gardens in Canberra in 1974. This plant is suitable as a <b>frost-resistant</b> groundcover in sunny situations. The fluffy white flowers and red stems of new growth are appealing features. It regenerates well from cuttings.|$|E
50|$|One {{possible}} explanation for plant thermoregulation is to provide protection against cold temperature. For example, the skunk cabbage is not <b>frost-resistant,</b> yet it begins to grow and flower when there is still snow on the ground. Another theory is that thermogenicity helps attract pollinators, which is borne out by observations that heat production is accompanied {{by the arrival of}} beetles or flies.|$|E
50|$|Under the Soviet government, the {{agricultural}} production of Russia was fairly stagnant; however, the sugar beet saw small increases in production. Despite the {{low rate of}} growth in production during the Soviet period, some particularly impressive advancements were made in seed development, of which the most useful was {{the development of a}} <b>frost-resistant</b> sugar beet, further expanding the growing range of the sugar beet.|$|E

50|$|Loganberry {{plants are}} sturdy and more disease- and <b>frost-resistant</b> {{than many other}} berries. However, they are not very popular with {{commercial}} growers due to several problems which increase labor costs, since the plants tend to be thorny and the berries are often hidden by the leaves. Additionally, berries of varying maturity may grow on a single plant, {{making it difficult to}} completely harvest each plant. Loganberries are therefore more commonly grown in household gardens.|$|E
50|$|Despite having {{large and}} {{attractive}} yellow flowers, {{many of which}} are terminal, this species is not often cultivated. It requires a well drained heavy soil, and prefers full sun, although it will tolerate part shade. It is hardy to drought and <b>frost-resistant</b> to , and responds well to pruning. In cultivation it rarely reaches 2 m high, and is short-lived. Propagation is by seed; seed takes around six weeks to germinate, with a germination success rate of about 70%.|$|E
50|$|The tree {{can grow}} up to 17 metres high. It is slow-growing, very hardy to drought and fairly <b>frost-resistant.</b> The wood is dark reddish-brown in colour and {{extremely}} dense and strong. It is a good for fires, which leads to widespread clearing of dead trees and the felling of healthy trees. It produces ear-shaped pods, favoured by {{a large number of}} herbivores including cattle. The seeds can be roasted and used as a substitute for coffee beans.|$|E
50|$|Senecio vulgaris is a <b>frost-resistant</b> {{deciduous}} annual {{plant that}} grows in disturbed sites, waste places, roadsides, gardens, nurseries, orchards, vineyards, landscaped areas, agricultural lands, at altitudes up to 1600 ft and is, additionally, self-pollinating producing 1,700 seeds per plant with three generations per year.

50|$|The {{most popular}} species is Albuca nelsonii, which is {{evergreen}} and not frost-hardy. Such species are {{best suited to}} temperate areas, but can be grown in a conservatory or greenhouse, or in a sheltered position if light frosts might occur. However, some other species from alpine or Karoo-like areas are fairly <b>frost-resistant</b> and may be deciduous, and accordingly can stand {{a good deal of}} frost once established. Some in fact are winter-flowering. As a rule they do well in full sun in light, free-draining soil. Propagate from offsets or seed.|$|E
5000|$|Chuño (...) is a {{freeze-dried}} potato product traditionally made by Quechua and Aymara {{communities of}} Bolivia and Peru, {{and is known}} in various countries of South America, including Argentina, Bolivia, Chile and Peru. It is a five-day process, obtained by exposing a <b>frost-resistant</b> variety of potatoes to the very low night temperatures of the Andean Altiplano, freezing them, and subsequently exposing them to the intense sunlight of the day (this being the traditional process). The word comes from Quechua ch'uñu, meaning 'frozen potato' ('wrinkled' in the dialects of the Junín Region).|$|E
50|$|Pyrogranite {{refers to}} a type of {{ornamental}} ceramics that were developed by Zsolnay and placed in production by 1886. Fired at high temperature, this durable material remains acid and <b>frost-resistant</b> making it suitable for use as roof tiles, indoor and outdoor decorative ceramics, and fireplaces. Architects that used the material in their buildings include Miklós Ybl, Ödön Lechner, Béla Lajta, Samu Pecz, and Imre Steindl. It {{can be seen in}} buildings such as Matthias Church, the Hungarian Parliament Building, the Museum of Applied Art, the Geological Institute, the Kőbánya Church, the Gellért Baths (all these buildings are in Budapest), the Town Hall in Kecskemét and many buildings, like the Post Office Palace, in Pécs.|$|E
50|$|Among the banksias, many {{of which}} grow in {{temperate}} and Mediterranean climates, the vast majority are shrubs; only a few are trees that are valued for their height. Among the tallest species are: B. integrifolia with its subspecies B. integrifolia subsp. monticola, which is noteworthy as the plants that form the subspecies are the tallest trees of the banksias {{and they are the}} more <b>frost-resistant</b> than other banksias, B. seminuda, B. littoralis, B. serrata; among those that can be considered small trees or large shrubs: B. grandis, B. prionotes, B. marginata, B. coccinea and B. speciosa; all of these are planted in parks and gardens and even along roadsides because of their size. The rest of the species of this genus, around 170 species, are shrubs, although some of them are valued for their flowers.|$|E
50|$|T. tessellatus also {{belongs to}} this third {{category}} and flowers at 45 year intervals - records from KwaZulu-Natal noting flowering in 1908, 1953 and 1998/99. It {{is regarded as}} rare and vulnerable, threatened by fire and exploitation, and is also a host of the IUCN Red Data Book listed butterfly Metisella syrinx. Often found in association with Leucosidea sericea, this <b>frost-resistant</b> species grows in dense clumps up to 5 metres tall, preferring moist rocky places, and has hollow culms or canes of 2-2.5 cm in diameter. The leaves {{at the base of}} branches are reduced to papery sheaths, while other leaves are 4-12 cm long and sharply pointed with spiny margins and a strongly tessellated surface. This is the only bamboo native to South Africa, its closest relative, Thamnocalamus spathiflorus, being found in the Himalaya.|$|E
5000|$|Hellebores {{are widely}} grown in USDA Zone 5a to 8b gardens for {{decorative}} purposes. They are particularly valued by gardeners for their winter and early spring flowering period; {{the plants are}} surprisingly <b>frost-resistant</b> and many are evergreen. [...] Also of value is their shade tolerance. Many species of hellebore have green or greenish-purple flowers and are of limited garden value, although Corsican hellebore (H. argutifolius), a robust plant with pale green, cup-shaped flowers and attractive leathery foliage, is widely grown. So is the 'stinking hellebore' or setterwort (H. foetidus), which has drooping clusters of small, pale green, bell-shaped flowers, often edged with maroon, which contrasts with its dark evergreen foliage. H. foetidus 'Wester Flisk', with red-flushed flowers and flower stalks, is becoming popular, as are more recent selections with golden-yellow foliage.|$|E

50|$|Strategically {{situated}} between Tampa and St. Petersburg, Oldsmar was {{ripe for}} development. The long bridges {{across the bay}} {{had not yet been}} built and the shortest way from Tampa to St. Petersburg was through Oldsmar. Olds designed a community for working people rather than for the wealthy. He used engineers and surveyors from Boston to design a well-platted community, modeled after Washington, D.C., with tree-lined boulevards leading from the bay to downtown. A power plant that served parts of Safety Harbor, Dunedin, and Clearwater was constructed. The streets were paved with oyster shells obtained nearby. Olds named many of the streets himself. Woodward, Jefferson, and Congress reminded him of Detroit. Olds named Gim Gong Road after a Chinese American horticulturist from DeLand, Florida. Gim Gong was working on developing <b>frost-resistant</b> citrus. The streets of Oldsmar were unusually wide and more than 20 mi of sidewalk were installed. Over the years much of the sidewalks was buried under a layer of sand.|$|E
50|$|Finland's {{climate and}} soils make growing crops a {{particular}} challenge. The country lies between the latitudes 60°N and 70°N, {{and it has}} severe winters and relatively short growing seasons that are sometimes interrupted by frost. However, because the Gulf Stream and the North Atlantic Drift Current moderate the climate, Finland contains half of the world's arable land north of 60° north latitude. Annual precipitation is usually sufficient, but it occurs almost exclusively during the winter months, making summer droughts a constant threat. In response to the climate, farmers have relied on quick-ripening and <b>frost-resistant</b> varieties of crops, and they have cultivated south-facing slopes as well as richer bottomlands to ensure production even in years with summer frosts. Most farmland was originally either forest or swamp, and the soil has usually required treatment with lime and years of cultivation to neutralize excess acid and to improve fertility. Irrigation has generally not been necessary, but drainage systems are often needed to remove excess water. Finland's agriculture has been efficient and productive—at least when compared with farming in other European countries.|$|E
30|$|Polypropylene is {{a highly}} perspective, {{polymeric}} anticorrosion material which is derived from petroleum gasses. Its melting point is 170 °C, it is stable against organic solvent {{as well as in}} 80 % sulfuric acid and caustic sodium, and is <b>frost-resistant.</b> Films from polypropylene possess lower gas permeability than polyethylene films.|$|E
40|$|Time-temperature {{profiles}} of freezing leaves from <b>frost-resistant</b> (Solanum acaule Bitt.) and frost-susceptible (Solanum tuberosum L. subsp. tuberosum Hawkes) types of potatoes {{did not reveal}} any major differences. The pattern of change in resistance of leaves to low voltage, low frequency current during freezing was different in the <b>frost-resistant</b> and susceptible leaves. In tissue sections from both types of leaves, cells freeze extracellularly at cooling velocities lower than 5 C per minute. Cells from leaves of resistant plants showed a higher osmotic pressure but not a higher water permeability than those from susceptible plants. The extent of injury caused by even very slow freezing was greater than that caused by equivalent isopiestic desiccation, particularly in susceptible leaves. The higher osmotic pressure in cells of leaves from resistant plants can account for the greater desiccation resistance {{but not for the}} frost resistance observed...|$|E
