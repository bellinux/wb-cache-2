5|$|As {{his wealth}} grew, Moore {{began to worry}} about his legacy. With {{the help of his}} {{daughter}} Mary, he set up the Henry Moore Trust in 1972, with a view to protecting his estate from death duties. By 1977, he was paying close to a million pounds a year in income tax; to mitigate <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> burden, he established the Henry Moore Foundation as a registered charity with Irina and Mary as trustees. The Foundation was established to encourage the public appreciation of the visual arts and especially the works of Moore. It now runs his house and estate at Perry Green, with a gallery, sculpture park and studios.|$|E
5|$|During the General Assembly's 2005 session, Fletcher again {{proposed}} <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> reform plan, {{and late}} in the session, both houses passed it. The plan raised sin taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, as well as upping taxes on satellite television service and motel rooms. Businesses were also subjected to a gross receipts tax. In exchange, corporate taxes were lowered, as were income taxes for individuals who earned less than $75,000 annually; 300,000 low-wage earners were dropped from the income tax rolls altogether. The Assembly also passed a budget {{for the remainder of}} the biennium, abolished the state's public campaign finance laws, and passed new school nutrition guidelines.|$|E
50|$|Thoreau’s {{own views}} {{were very much}} {{influenced}} by these non-resistants, and are often confused with them even today. When Amos Bronson Alcott resisted <b>his</b> <b>taxes</b> to protest war and slavery, three years before Thoreau would resist <b>his</b> <b>taxes</b> over the same issues, Alcott’s action was explained {{within the context of}} “non-resistant” philosophy. When Thoreau explained <b>his</b> own <b>tax</b> resistance, he took pains to distinguish his theory from theirs, titling his essay Resistance to Civil Government.|$|R

5|$|In 1973, {{producer}} Ilya Salkind {{convinced his}} father Alexander {{to buy the}} rights to Superman. They hired Mario Puzo to pen a two-film script, and negotiated with Steven Spielberg to direct, though Alexander Salkind rejected him as Jaws went over budget. Marlon Brando and Gene Hackman signed on to play Jor-El and Lex Luthor respectively, and Guy Hamilton was hired to direct. However, Brando was faced with an obscenity lawsuit in Italy over Last Tango in Paris, and Hamilton was unable to shoot in England as he had violated <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> payments. The Salkinds hired Richard Donner to direct the film. Donner hired Tom Mankiewicz to polish the script, giving it a serious feel with Christ-like overtones.|$|E
5|$|Polls {{consistently}} {{indicated a}} tight {{race for the}} November general election. Negative ads from both sides dominated the campaign, with Obama's proclaiming that Romney shipped jobs overseas while at Bain Capital and kept money in offshore tax havens and Swiss bank accounts. A related issue dealt with Romney's purported responsibility for actions at Bain Capital after taking the Olympics post. Romney faced demands from Democrats to release additional years of <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> returns, an action a number of Republicans also felt would be wise; after being adamant {{that he would not}} do that, he released summaries of them in late September. During May and June, the Obama campaign spent heavily and was able to paint a negative image of Romney in voters' minds before the Romney campaign could construct a positive one.|$|E
5|$|Although Democrats held a {{majority}} {{in both houses of}} the General Assembly, they were divided by factionalism, which made it difficult for Chandler to find sufficient support for his programs. Some of the factionalism came from Clements and Combs supporters who were not willing to cooperate with Chandler, their chief political enemy. Still other resistance to Chandler came from a group of more liberal lawmakers like John B. Breckinridge who simply had philosophical differences with the governor. Near the end of the 1958 legislative session, this group demanded a special session to deal with the need for more money for schools and welfare programs, but Chandler refused to call the session when the liberals would not agree to pass only the measures he put before them. Because of the factionalism, Chandler had to ally with Republican legislators throughout his term in order to pass many of his proposals, including <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> plan. Frequently, this meant promising to build or repair roads in Republican districts in return for their support of his programs.|$|E

5|$|In {{the second}} half of 2004, Fletcher {{proposed}} changes to the health benefits of state workers and retirees. Fletcher's plan provided discounts for members who engaged in healthier behavior, which he called a transition from a sickness initiative to a wellness initiative. Acknowledging that out-of-pocket expenses would rise, Fletcher proposed a 1% salary increase to offset the additional costs. State employees, particularly public school teachers, broadly opposed Fletcher's plan, and the Kentucky Educators Association called for an indefinite strike, to begin October 27, 2004. To address the opposition, Fletcher called a special session of the legislature to begin October 5, 2004. Although the state was still operating under an executive spending plan, Fletcher did not include the budget or <b>his</b> <b>tax</b> reform proposal in the session's agenda, a move praised by both parties, allowing them to focus only on concerns over the health plan. In a fifteen-day session, the General Assembly passed a plan that allocated $190 million more to health insurance for state workers and restored many of the most popular benefits in the previous insurance plan. Immediately after the session adjourned, the Kentucky Educators Association voted to cancel their proposed strike.|$|E

Daschle also had some miscommunications with his accountant on the $255,000 use of a luxury car service that was used 80% for personal services. Daschle paid his back taxes six days before his first confirmation hearings with the United States Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions.
