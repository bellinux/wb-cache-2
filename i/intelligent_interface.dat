40|$|Utilising <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> {{techniques}} {{in the design}} of systems introduces certain risks. An <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> is not static, but will actively adapt to the perceived needs of the user. Unless carefully designed, these changes may lead to an unpredictable, obscure and uncontrollable interface. Therefore the design of intelligent interfaces must ensure that users can inspect the intelligent mechanisms, and control their results. One {{way to do this is}} to rely on the user's understanding of the application and the domain, and relate the adaptivity mechanisms to domain-specific concepts. We present an example of an adaptive hypertext help system POP, which is being built according to these principles, and discuss the design considerations and empirical findings that lead to this design. 1 Introduction Utilising <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> {{techniques in}} interactive systems introduces certain risks.

Databases must be intelligent {{enough to make the}} accessibility faster. However, not every user familiar with the Structured Query Language (SQL) queries as they may not aware of structure of the database and they thus require to learn SQL. So, non-expert users need a system to interact with relational databases in their natural language such as English. For this, Database Management System (DBMS) must have an ability to understand Natural Language (NL). In this research, an <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> is developed using semantic matching technique which translates natural language query to SQL using set of production rules and data dictionary. The data dictionary consists of semantics sets for relations and attributes. A series of steps like lower case conversion, tokenization, speech tagging, database element and SQL element extraction is used to convert Natural Language Query (NLQ) to SQL Query. The transformed query is executed and the results are obtained by the user. <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Interface</b> is the need of database applications to enhance efficient interaction between user and DBMS. ...|$|E

40|$|Vital to {{the success}} of an expert system is an {{interface}} to the user which performs intelligently. A generic <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> is being developed for expert systems. This <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> was developed around the in-house developed Expert System for the Flight Analysis System (ESFAS). The Flight Analysis System (FAS) is comprised of 84 configuration controlled FORTRAN subroutines that are used in the preflight analysis of the space shuttle. In order to use FAS proficiently, a person must be knowledgeable in the areas of flight mechanics, the procedures involved in deploying a certain payload, and an overall understanding of the FAS. ESFAS, still in its developmental stage, is taking into account much of this knowledge. The generic <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> involves the integration of a speech recognizer and synthesizer, a preparser, and a natural language parser to ESFAS. The speech recognizer being used is capable of recognizing 1000 words of connected speech. The natural language parser is a commercial software package which uses caseframe instantiation in processing the streams of words from the speech recognizer or the keyboard. The systems configuration is described along with capabilities and drawbacks...|$|E

Solutions to eliminate or prevent receive livelock typically involve extensive (and potentially costly) modifications to the host operating system.

This solution utilizes additional intelligence on network adapters to detect host input load levels and dynamically modulate the rate at which interrupts are delivered to the host. Using qualitative and quantitative comparisons, we argue that an adapter-based approach for receive livelock elimination performs at least as well as, but is more cost-effective than, the host-based approaches proposed in the literature. We also demonstrate how <b>intelligent</b> <b>interface</b> backoff can be employed effectively in multi-ho [...] ...|$|E
