On 29 occasions between 1 November and 24 April 2015, two Ospreys and a KC-130J aerial tanker assigned to this Tactical Recovery of Aircraft and Personnel (TRAP) mission spent 145 flight hours loitering, ready to perform rescue missions if required. The only pilot that was downed was a Jordanian, {{but he did not}} have a radio on him when he ejected and landed too close to ISIL forces.|$|E
50|$|Between {{the years}} 1775 and 1779, the Indian trade routes with Baghdad, Aleppo, Smyrna and Constantinople were {{diverted}} <b>to</b> <b>Kuwait.</b> The East India Company was diverted <b>to</b> <b>Kuwait</b> in 1792. The East India Company secured the sea routes between Kuwait, India {{and the east}} coasts of Africa. After the Persians withdrew from Basra in 1779, <b>Kuwait</b> continued <b>to</b> attract trade away from Basra. The flight of many of Basra's leading merchants <b>to</b> <b>Kuwait</b> continued <b>to</b> {{play a significant role}} in Basra's commercial stagnation well into the 1850s.|$|R

5|$|On 15 January 1991, 12 French Jaguars bombed Ahmad al-Jaber Air Base, Kuwait; {{three were}} damaged {{in the attack}} but all {{returned}} to base. On 26January, RAF Jaguars and Tornadoes raided several Silkworm missile batteries in <b>Kuwait</b> <b>to</b> encourage the perception of an imminent amphibious invasion to liberate the country. On the 30th, two RAF Jaguars destroyed a Polnochny-class landing ship with rockets and cannon. The Iraqi Republican Guard, entrenched on the Kuwait-Saudi border, were subjected to a continuous intensive bombing campaign for weeks to demoralise them, allied Jaguars forming {{a portion of the}} delivering aircraft. The Jaguars also performed valuable reconnaissance of the combat area for Coalition forces. Both nations' Jaguars were withdrawn from the region in March 1991, at the end of Desert Storm.|$|E
5|$|While in Kuwait, Manning {{was placed}} on suicide watch after her {{behavior}} caused concern. She was moved from <b>Kuwait</b> <b>to</b> the Marine Corps Base Quantico, Virginia, on July 29, 2010, and classified as a maximum custody detainee with Prevention of Injury (POI) status. POI status is one stop short of suicide watch, entailing checks by guards every five minutes. Her lawyer, David Coombs, a former military attorney, said Manning {{was not allowed to}} sleep between 5 am (7 am on weekends) and 8 pm, and was made to stand or sit up if she tried to. She was required to remain visible at all times, including at night, which entailed no access to sheets, no pillow except one built into her mattress, and a blanket designed not to be shredded. Manning complained that she regarded it as pretrial punishment.|$|E

25|$|Six {{countries}} (Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, Bahrain, Qatar, United Arab Emirates and Oman) {{form the}} Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC). However, {{this is a}} disputed term. Iranians assert {{that it is a}} historical and internationally recognized convention to name it the Persian Gulf, while Arab States, and most notably the six GCC member countries, have been claiming that the Gulf is Arabian since its shallow marine depths are a geological continuity of the Arabian peninsula's Eastern low-lying coasts, from <b>Kuwait</b> <b>to</b> the UAE's Northern Emirates.|$|E

Among the internet service providers in Hong Kong, PCCW's Netvigator was the slowest to resume enough bandwidth for their users. Therefore, as a temporary remedy, many internet users in Hong Kong used proxy servers in Australia, Thailand, Spain or even the UAE and <b>Kuwait</b> <b>to</b> access foreign websites.|$|E

25|$|In 1961, an Army buildup {{close to}} Kuwait in {{conjunction}} with Iraqi claims over the small neighbouring state, led to a crisis with British military forces (land, sea, and air) deployed to Kuwait for a period. In 1961, Kuwait gained independence from Britain and Iraq claimed sovereignty over Kuwait. As in the 1930s, Qasim based Iraq's claim on the assertion that Kuwait had been a district of the Ottoman province of Basra, unjustly severed by the British from {{the main body of}} Iraqi state when it had been created in the 1920s. Britain reacted strongly to Iraq's claim and sent troops to <b>Kuwait</b> <b>to</b> deter Iraq. Qāsim was forced to back down and in October 1963, Iraq recognized the sovereignty of Kuwait.|$|E
