Similar proposals were made in 1965 and 1968, but failed to attract support. The federal government passed the High Speed Ground Transportation Act of 1965 to fund pilot programs in the Northeast Corridor, but this did nothing to address passenger deficits.

Diffusion patterns of the integral sprinkler cover system in the sugarcane sector of Reunion Island (France) are estimated using a sample of 110 farmers aggregated over the period 1990 to 2006. We show that imitation is the main explanatory factor of the adoption dynamics.

40|$|Minimum term {{contracts}} (2 ̆ 01 cMTC 2 ̆ 01 d) {{are widely}} used in the communications sector. They are frequently associated with <b>equipment</b> <b>subsidies.</b> But they are also offered to customers {{in exchange for a}} discount. MTCs usually come with an early termination fee (2 ̆ 01 cETF 2 ̆ 01 d), a penalty the customer has to pay for leaving the company {{before the end of the}} contract period. This paper provides an economic rationale for the use of MTCs when they are not linked to handset subsidies, discusses the design of the ETF in these cases, and assesses the potential implications in terms of market efficiency. We show that MTCs can be used as a screening device to segment the market between customers with differing preferences for being able to change provider at any time. This may result in a higher level of output and lower average prices...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{develops}} a methodology {{to evaluate the}} impact of policies for the transition from analogue to digital television. After reviewing market outcomes and government intervention in television markets, we construct a micro-founded model of the diffusion of digital television. Television viewers can receive the digital signal only if they purchase new costly equipment for digital reception. Until the almost totality of households have converted their equipment, it is not politically feasible to switch off the analogue signal. The fact that the switch off policy is conditional on aggregate adoption introduces strategic effects. The policy makers can affect the speed of take up of digital television by: (i) controlling {{the quality of the}} signals and the content of public service broadcasters, (ii) intervening in the market for digital <b>equipment</b> with <b>subsidies,</b> and (iii) publicising the conditions and date of switch off of the analogue signal. The model is simulated to predict the impact of these and other government policies on the take up of digital television...|$|R

40|$|The {{general purpose}} of the study is to find {{information}} about and analyze model of Rural Minapadi (Rice-Fish System) Development Program to improve household income of small-scale fishermen. The specific {{purpose of the}} study is to develop economic model and household economic behavior of small-scale fisherman through Rural Minapadi (Rice-Fish System) Development Program in Donggala, Central Sulawesi. The population is small-scale fishermen in Donggala who participate in Rural Minapadi (Rice-Fish System) Development Program. Multi-stage sampling is the sampling method. Model of household economy for small-scale fishermen is developed from 17 (seventeen) equations or endogenous variables that consists of 8 (eight) behavioral equations and 9 (nine) identity equations. Two Stage Least Squares (2 SLS) and simulation analysis are used to give estimation towards parameters in simultaneous equation. Data analysis uses Statistical Analysis System (SAS). The findings show that household economic model of small-scale fisherman can be described based on the amount of marine commodity they are able to catch, the amount of work they do, household food and non-food spending that tends to increase when there is an increase in size of fishing boat, gasoline consumption and fishing frequency. Based on the analysis, the household economic model for small-scale fisherman is valid theoretically and it can provide accurate description. In order to get larger amount of marine commodity that eventually results in an increase of income and welfare, some household decisions are taken and some policy is established; they are increase in fishing frequency and workload as well as some allowance from the government in the form of fishing <b>equipments</b> and <b>subsidy</b> for gasoline...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{analyses}} {{the theoretical}} and empirical relationship between employment, skill structure and innovation in East and West German manufacturing firms. The econometric part builds on firm data from the Mannheim Innovation Panel 1993, 1994 and 1995. In the German industrial sector, especially in East Germany, employment has declined and the share of highly skilled labour has risen. The econometric investigation of labour demand, based on the translog production function, reveals differences in the firms' behaviour in East and West German manufacturing and between innovative and non-innovative firms. It is shown that complex patterns of substitution between capital and different types of labour emerge, which depend {{on the stage of}} economic transformation, the type of firms, wage setting behaviour and public policy. The results suggest that in the current stage of transition subsidising labour might be more effective for creating jobs in East Germany than promoting R&D and capital <b>equipment.</b> <b>Subsidies</b> can be lower the higher the workers' qualification level is...|$|E
40|$|Efficient {{agricultural}} water management is indispensable in meeting future food demands. The European Water Framework Directive promotes several {{measures such as}} the adoption of adequate water pricing mechanisms or the promotion of water-saving irrigation technologies. We apply a stochastic dynamic programming model (SDPM) to analyze a farmer's optimal investment strategy to adopt a water-efficient drip irrigation system or a sprinkler irrigation system under uncertainty about future production conditions, i. e. about future precipitation patterns. We assess the optimal timing to invest into either irrigation system in the planning period 2010 to 2040. We then investigate how alternative policies, (a) irrigation water pricing, and (b) <b>equipment</b> <b>subsidies</b> for drip irrigation, affect the investment strategy. We perform the analysis for the semi-arid agricultural production region Marchfeld in Austria, and use data from the biophysical process simulation model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) which takes into account site and management related characteristics as well as weather parameters from a statistical climate change model. We find that investment in drip irrigation is unlikely unless subsidies for equipment cost are granted. Also water prices do not increase the probability to adopt a drip irrigation system, but rather delay the timing to invest into either irrigation system...|$|E
40|$|Irrigated {{agriculture}} {{will play}} a crucial role to meet future food demand, but a sustainable water resource management in agriculture is crucial as well. Therefore, the European Water Framework Directive promotes several measures, e. g., the adoption of adequate water pricing mechanisms or the promotion of water-saving irrigation techniques. Since production conditions such as weather and climate development are uncertain, farmers might be reluctant to invest in a water-saving but capital intensive irrigation system. We apply a stochastic dynamic programming approach to analyze a farmer’s optimal investment strategy for either a water–saving drip irrigation system or sprinkler irrigation system under weather uncertainty and assess the probability of adopting either irrigation system until the year 2040. We design two policy scenarios: (i) irrigation water pricing and (ii) <b>equipment</b> <b>subsidies</b> for drip irrigation, and investigate how they affect the farmer’s optimal investment strategy. Our case study analysis is performed for the region Marchfeld, a typical semi-arid agricultural production region in Austria. We use data from the bio-physical process simulation model EPIC (Environmental Policy Integrated Climate) which accounts for site and management related characteristics as well as weather parameters from a statistical climate change model. We find that investment in drip irrigation is unlikely unless subsidies for equipment cost are granted. Even water prices do not increase the probability to adopt a drip irrigation system, but rather decrease the probability to invest into either irrigation system.

40|$|Government of Sri Lanka {{provides}} subsidy {{on electricity}} to uplift the living condition of citizens for decades. This research project mainly scrutinize, whether {{the objectives of}} the electricity subsidies have been fulfilled or not. Further, both positive and negative impacts of electricity subsidy is descriptively discussed. Appropriate remedial actions are proposed for the betterment of identified indirect negative impacts. In the analysis, it was found that some primary objectives of the electricity subsidy have not been achieved. One of the most subtle negative impact recognised is the encouragement of energy inefficient equipment usage among subsidized consumers. A case study was conducted in Ratnapura District to investigate the energy inefficient equipment usage and to quantify the electricity wastage. Findings were used to estimate the electricity wastage in whole country due to inefficient equipment. Further, {{it was found that the}} existing tariff structure encourages the energy inefficient equipment usage and it acts contradictory to the fundamentals. As a possible way of saving electricity and catering the demand at night peak, replacement of incandescent lamps were analyzed and possible saving were estimated. Moreover the investment on replacing incandescent lamps by energy efficient equipment was estimated and financially evaluated with the returns. Additionally, it was found that the eligibility criteria of current subsidy is having many loopholes. The major shortcoming is that it allows unwanted people to enjoy the subsidy. The additional burden to the treasury has been estimated as LKR 11 billion per year. It was seen that modifications are needed for electricity subsidy eligibility to ensure only needy people receive the electricity subsidy. Meanwhile modifications are needed for tariff rates fixing method. New equation shall be introduced based on actual generation cost for the tariff rates calculation with appropriate justifications. Further it is recommended to reduce the electricity subsidy gradually to zero. Discouragement of energy inefficient equipment usage by introducing new taxes, promoting energy efficient <b>equipment,</b> introducing <b>subsidies</b> to energy efficient equipment and conducting awareness programs regarding the electricity conservation are the other recommendations to minimize the negative impacts of electricity subsidy...|$|R
40|$|A {{survey of}} 190 dairy farms in a {{co-operative}} {{area in the}} south of Ireland served as the main source of data in the present study. Eight farms representative of the different types of dairy farms were chosen and their data were analysed using the Finpack financial analysis program. These eight case studies were analysed using alternative funding strategies to determine the effect of alternative funding strategies for farm buildings on net farm income. The data obtained were extrapolated to the national dairy herd. There are some 14, 050 dairy farms with quotas of less than 15, 000 gallons and 40 % of these were classified as non viable. The corresponding figures for other quota categories are as follows: 8, 150 farms with quotas of 15, 000 - 25, 000 gallons with 40 % non-viable; 7780 farms with quotas of 25, 000 - 40, 000 gallons with 20 % nonviable; and 8, 535 farms with quotas > 40, 000 gallons with 10 % nonviable. Non-viable dairy farms were those with low income, low contact with advisory services, low household dependence on farm income, a poor attitude to development and expansion and generally inadequate farm facilities. Non-viable dairy farms should consider changing from dairying into a suckler and/or beef enterprise and should be assisted to do so by the advisory service. They should be considered for a suckler quota unit for each 987 gallons of milk they had been producing. They should consider using income assistants, e. g., REPS, Early Retirement Scheme and/or unemployment benefits as relevant. Training schemes should be targeted at young farmers and their spouses who are not working so that they {{have a better chance of}} offfarm employment, when relevant. Potentially viable and viable dairy farms should be assisted on a sliding scale depending on their quota size, as follows: Grant aid for upgrading milking facilities, grant aid for milking and milk cooling <b>equipment,</b> interest <b>subsidies</b> on interest payment on money borrowed for agricultural development, the smallest milk quota farms should be considered the priority for milk quota reallocation, quota purchase should be subsidised if possible, quota leasing should be subsidised for the smallest quota category (< 15, 000 gallons), installation Aid should be introduced for all viable and potentially viable dairy farms.

40|$|With an ever {{increasing}} {{concern for the}} environment, different methods of managing organic waste on dairy farms have been explored and analyzed. Anaerobic digestion {{has long been a}} popular method of managing organic waste. Its popularity stems from the potential to decrease greenhouse gases, improve air quality and provide a source of additional revenue for the farm. Problems with implementing anaerobic digestion arise from high failure rates, high start-up costs and continuous maintenance and <b>equipment</b> replacement. <b>Subsidies</b> for the initial investment and improved technology have increased the possibility of large-scale dairy farms to adopt anaerobic digestion. Due to economies of scale large-scale dairy farms are more able to adopt anaerobic digestion, but small-scale dairies struggle to finance the investment, maintain the digester system and provide sufficient organic waste to continuously feed the microorganisms inside the digester system. The increasing impact of urbanization greatly impacts the demand for anaerobic digestion on small-scale farms to mitigate the negative effects of organic waste produced by dairy farms. Dr. Conly Hansen at Utah State University suggested we use an IBR digester model to analyze the feasibility of adopting anaerobic digestion on small-scale farms. The IBR digester system is more conducive to small-scale dairies located in regions with varying temperature (i. e., Utah), and may be the solution to mitigate the negative effects of organic farm waste. Dr. Donald McMahon also suggested we analyze the potential of implementing a digester on a dairy farm that produces artisan cheese. We predicted that this would improve the feasibility due to the need to dispose of whey from the cheese production. To determine the feasibility of implementing a digester system on a small-scale dairy farm the net present value and the internal rate of return were calculated to estimate the success of the investment. These financial measures were calculated from equipment price quotes, estimations from the literature review and from using estimated annual receipts and costs for a dairy farm, artisan cheese plant and anaerobic digester system. The feasibility also depends on the success of marketing the products produced from the digester system and the farmer’s participation in incentive programs for digester systems. The products produced vary from electricity to waste disposal services, and marketing an array of diverse products and services is important {{to the success of the}} digester system. The feasibility determined by this study was estimated using generalized assumptions from various sources and should be analyzed by individual operations to determine specific farm feasibility...|$|R

' (author's abstract) Der Verfasser fragt nach dem Zusammenhang von Innovationen und Qualifikationsstruktur aus mikrooekonomischer Sicht. Auf der Basis von Daten aus den Jahren 1993 bis 1995 werden innovative und nicht-innovative Unternehmen in den alten und den neuen Bundeslaendern identifiziert und fuenf Typen von Arbeitsqualifikationen unterschieden. Eine oekonometrische Analyse der Arbeitsnachfrage macht Unterschiede zwischen Unternehmen in Ost- und Westdeutschland sowie zwischen innovativen und nicht-innovativen Unternehmen deutlich. Die Nachfrage nach hoeher qualifizierter Arbeitskraft ist in Ostdeutschland hoeher als in Westdeutschland, sie ist gleichzeitig in innovativen Unternehmen hoeher als in nicht-innovativen. Zur Bekaempfung der Arbeitslosigkeit bieten sich Qualifizierungsmassnahmen sowie Lohsubventionen an.
