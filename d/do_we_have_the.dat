The $1.415 billion penalty included an $800 million civil settlement and a $515 million criminal fine. The U.S. Justice Department said the criminal fine of $515 million was the largest ever in a health care case, and the largest criminal fine for an individual corporation ever imposed in a U.S. criminal prosecution of any kind. [...] "That was a blemish for us," [...] John C. Lechleiter, CEO of Lilly, told The New York Times. [...] "We don’t ever want that to happen again. We put measures in place to assure that not only <b>do</b> <b>we</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> right intentions in integrity and compliance, but we have systems in place to support that."

5000|$|In June 2005, McCaffrey {{surveyed}} Iraq {{on behalf}} of U.S. Central Command and wrote an optimistic report afterwards. In the report, McCaffrey described U.S. senior military leadership team as superb and predicted the insurgency will reach its peak from January-to-September 2006, allowing for U.S. force withdrawals {{in the late summer}} of 2006. A year later, however, after visiting Iraq again, his assessment was grim: [...] "Iraq is abject misery ... I think it's a terribly dangerous place for diplomats and journalists and contractors and Iraqi mothers. Trying to go about daily life in that city is a real nightmare for these poor people." [...] He called Abu Ghraib [...] "the biggest mistake that happened so far." [...] In an official memorandum, McCaffrey nevertheless expressed optimism about the operation's longer term future: [...] "The situation is perilous, uncertain, and extreme - but far from hopeless. The U.S. Armed Forces are a rock. This is the most competent and brilliantly led military in a tactical and operational sense that we have ever fielded ... There is no reason why the U.S. cannot achieve our objectives in Iraq. Our aim must be to create a viable federal state under the rule of law which does not: enslave its own people, threaten its neighbors, or produce weapons of mass destruction. This is a 10-year task. We should be able to draw down most of our combat forces in 3-5 years. We have few alternatives to the current U.S. strategy, which is painfully but gradually succeeding.
