5|$|The {{result of}} this process has been a steady {{increase}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> output of the Sun.

The hydrogen fuel at the core will finally be exhausted in five billion years, when the Sun will be 67% more luminous than at present. Thereafter the Sun will continue to burn hydrogen in a shell surrounding its core, until the luminosity reaches 121% above the present value. This marks the end of the Sun's main sequence lifetime, and thereafter it will pass through the subgiant stage and evolve into a red giant.|$|E

5|$|There {{are several}} causes {{of an urban}} heat island (UHI); for example, dark {{surfaces}} absorb significantly more solar radiation, which causes urban concentrations of roads and buildings to heat more than suburban and rural areas during the day; materials commonly used in urban areas for pavement and roofs, such as concrete and asphalt, have significantly different thermal bulk properties (including heat capacity and thermal conductivity) and surface radiative properties (albedo and emissivity) than the surrounding rural areas. This causes a change <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> budget of the urban area, often leading to higher temperatures than surrounding rural areas. Another major reason {{is the lack of}} evapotranspiration (for example, through lack of vegetation) in urban areas. With a decreased amount of vegetation, cities also lose the shade and cooling effect of trees, and the removal of carbon dioxide.|$|E
5|$|When a {{continuous}} spectrum of energy is {{passed through a}} gas or plasma, some of the photons are absorbed by atoms, causing electrons to change their energy level. Those excited electrons that remain bound to their atom spontaneously emit this energy as a photon, traveling in a random direction, and so drop back to lower energy levels. Thus the atoms behave like a filter that forms a series of dark absorption bands <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>energy</b> output. (An observer viewing the atoms from a view {{that does not include}} the continuous spectrum in the background, instead sees a series of emission lines from the photons emitted by the atoms.) Spectroscopic measurements of the strength and width of atomic spectral lines allow the composition and physical properties of a substance to be determined.|$|E
