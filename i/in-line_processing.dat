Impressive data rates necessitate equally impressive computational power in order to perform all the associated video processing in real-time. This is fairly problematic considering the limited capabilities of most automotive embedded processors, but this is changing with the entry of FPGAs into the automotive market [23 – 25]. Aside from offering substantial (and sufficient) <b>in-line</b> <b>processing</b> power, FPGAs also serve to reduce cost by combining most of the interface glue-logic into a single chip.

The central {{innovation in the}} NetBouncer approach to filtering and mitigating DDoS attacks {{is the ability to}} distinguish legitimate traffic from illegitimate ones so as to enable the discarding of only illegitimate traffic. In particular, this allows a NetBouncer-enabled network to distinguish DDoS congestion from flash crowd congestion situations.

Application-level overlay networks are a natural way to realize these applications ’ data flows and their internal computations, but existing middleware is not designed to scale to the data rates and low overhead computations necessary for the high performance domain.

Focus is mainly placed on the absence or control of potentially pathogenic microbes such as Salmonella and Campylobacter but, from commercial point of view, other spoilage bacteria also play a role. Regarding food safety, the primary target should be the production of pathogen-free live animals, thereby allowing slaughter plants to keep the processing line free of those micro-organisms. Pathogen-free feed is fundamental in obtaining such conditions, as is the Good Hygienic Practice in farming, including grand parent stock (GPS), parent stock (PS) and hatcheries. Interventions in the slaughter plant cannot always completely remove pathogens. However there are some measures of control available, including separation of flocks, carcass decontamination and implementing a balanced and operational HACCP system.

The influence of different process parameters like silane-hydrogen-ratio and substrate temperature on dark and photoconductivity, microstructure parameter (ratio between different hydrogen bonds) and microcrystalline fraction was investigated.

For deposition of sputtered particles on chamber and substrate surfaces, a pressure dependent distribution matrix is used, which is obtained from single-particle Monte Carlo calculations. The flow conductances for different pressure conditions are calculated using the well known "Direct Simulation Monte Carlo" method implemented on a Linux cluster, where for each volume cell an individual calculation task can be spawned. Tuned with flow conductances and particle distribution factors distribution factors from Monte Carlo calculations our coupled model is capable to describe real in-line sputtering processes on a single-processor PC at almost real time speed. All numerical models are implemented within a simulation system RIG-VM devoloped at Fraunhofer IST, which enables easy communication between separate modules e. g. during modeling of a controlling cycle and ensures interchangeability and reusability by using XML datasheets and web browser based user interfaces. In this paper we apply our model to reactive sputtering of SiO 2 with l-probe based oxygen partial pressure stabilization. The model is adapted to experiment via material parameter variation. The resulting simulation system can be applied for optimization of process parameters with respect to process stability and film homogeneity...|$|E

40|$|The use of MEMS (micro-electro-mechanical system) sensors in {{multiple}} applications of environmental monitoring help {{to fill the}} need of a small scale, low power monitoring and sensing applications. In this design, the use of single-die multiple MEMS sensors to monitor ambient temperature, relative humidity, and accelerative high-g shock were developed and tested. In addition to the sensors, signal conditioning circuits were developed for outputting the sensor data into a microcontroller to analyze and process the signals into useful information for human operators to analyze. The three sensors were fabricated using a bulk micro-machined process on 100 mm silicon wafers developed in the RIT SMFL. This work extends previous work on a multisensor from a year earlier. Ion implantation is now used to tune doping levels. To help reduce cross-talk between sensors, p-wells were introduced to aid in substrate isolation. A parallel plate humidity sensor was developed, bringing {{the need to develop}} <b>in-line</b> <b>processing</b> of polyimide. Lastly, the one-axis shock sensor is upgraded into a three-axis shock sensor. The temperature sensor is made using a PN diode, utilizing the temperature dependence of the forward bias voltage drop from the Shockley diode equation, corresponding to - 2. 2 mV/°C response over a range of - 50 °C to 150 °C for the application operation range. Signal conditioning is a constant current mode operation, measuring the change in voltage drop across the diode. The relative humidity sensor is formed from one of two designs; an interdigitated comb-finger capacitor or a parallel plate capacitor. Polyimide was used as the dielectric material due to linear diffusion properties of water vapor to relative humidity. While the comb-finger sensor was coated with polyimide post-processing, a new thin film processing and integration technique was developed for the first time here at RIT for the parallel plate sensor. Due to the small levels of capacitive change in the range of 5...|$|E
