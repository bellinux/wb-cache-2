For all dopings we find negative differential conductivity at sufficiently {{high electric}} fields. In low-doped samples {{the presence of}} <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> modifies the current-voltage characteristics substantially and we find two different current peaks whose relative height is changing with the electron temperature. These findings can explain the observation of different peaks in the current-voltage characteristics with and without external THz irradiation in low-doped samples.

50|$|Regarding {{the origin}} of {{superconductivity}} in diamond, three alternative theories exist at the moment: conventional BCS theory based on phonon-mediated pairing, correlated <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> theory and spin-flip-driven pairing of holes weakly localized {{in the vicinity of}} the Fermi level. Whereas there is no solid experimental support for either model, recent accurate measurements of isotopic shift of the transition temperature Tc upon boron and carbon isotopic substitutions favor the BCS theory.|$|E
50|$|At {{moderate}} doping levels the dopant atoms create individual doping {{levels that}} {{can often be}} considered as localized states that can donate electrons or holes by thermal promotion (or an optical transition) to the conduction or valence bands respectively. At high enough impurity concentrations the individual impurity atoms may become close enough neighbors that their doping levels merge into an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> and the behavior of such a system ceases to show the typical traits of a semiconductor, e.g. its increase in conductivity with temperature. On the other hand, a degenerate semiconductor still has far fewer charge carriers than a true metal so that its behavior {{is in many ways}} intermediary between semiconductor and metal.|$|E
40|$|The {{electronic}} {{structure of a}} prototype dilute magnetic semiconductor (DMS), Ga 1 -xMnxAs, is studied by magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) spectroscopy. We prove that the optical transitions originated from <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> cause the strong positive MCD background. The MCD signal due to the E 0 transition from the valence band to the conduction band is negative indicating that the p-d exchange interactions between the p-carriers and d-spin is antiferromagnetic. The negative E 0 MCD signal also indicates that the hole-doping of the valence band is not so large as previously assumed. The <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> seem to play important roles for the ferromagnetism of Ga 1 -xMnxAs. Comment: 13 pages, 3 figure...|$|R
40|$|Impurity-induced {{quasiparticle}} bound {{states on}} a pair-breaking {{surface of a}} d-wave superconductor are theoretically described, taking into account hybridization of impurity- and surface-induced Andreev states. Further a theory for effects of surface disorder (of thin impurity surface layer) on the low-bias conductance of tunnel junctions is developed. We find a threshold $n_c$ for surface impurity concentration $n_S$, which separates the two regimes for surface impurity effects on the zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). Below the threshold, surface impurities do not broaden the ZBCP, but effectively reduce its weight and generate <b>impurity</b> <b>bands.</b> For low $n_S$ <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> can be, in principle, resolved experimentally, being centered at energies of bound states induced by an isolated impurity on the surface. For larger $n_S$ <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are distorted, move to lower energies and, beginning with the threshold concentration $n_S=n_c$, become centered at zero energy. With increasing $n_S$ above the threshold, the ZBCP is quickly destroyed {{in the case of}} strong scatterers, while it is gradually suppressed and broaden in the presence of weak impurity potentials. More realistic cases, taking into account additional broadening, not related to the surface disorder, are also considered. Comment: 9 pages, 7 figure...|$|R
40|$|It {{was shown}} that thermal {{treatment}} of semi-insulating specially undoped gallium arsenide leads to significant changes of lux-brightness characteristics of inter- <b>impurity</b> and <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> in the spectra of impurity luminescence. The indicated changes {{are due to}} transformations in the system of non-radiating channels of hole recombination in it {{that took place in}} the process of thermal treatment. The effect observed can lead to variation of the correlation between the intensities of bands in the spectrum of impurity photoluminescence even if the change of concentration of luminescence centers does not occur. Such changes in lux-brightness characteristics of <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> should be concerned while using photoluminescence spectra for the analysis of changes occurring in impurity-deficient composition of gallium arsenide during its thermal treatment...|$|R

The other sign choice, suggested in cond-mat/ 0111504, leads to an unphysical description of the occupied states of the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> (extremely long tail, no mobility edge, no bulk ferromagnetism).

Two realistic models are compared: one has no <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> while the other shows an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> for low Mn concentrations. The calculated magnetic circular dichroism (MCD) is positive for both models proving that, unlike previously asserted, the observed positive MCD signal is inconclusive as to {{the presence or absence}} of an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> in GaMnAs.

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the density of}} states of a two dimensional electron gas located at the interface of a GaAlAs/GaAs heterojunction. The disorder potential which is generally created by a single doping layer behind a spacer, is here enhanced {{by the presence of}} a second delta doped layer of scatterers which can be repulsive or attractive impurities. We have calculated the density of states by means of the Klauder's approximation, {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field of arbitrary strength. At low field either <b>band</b> tails or <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are observed for attractive potentials, depending on the impurity concentration. At higher field, <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are observed for both repulsive and attractive potentials.

40|$|It {{is pointed}} out that point defects on {{graphene}} are strongly correlated {{and can not be}} treated as independent scatters. In particular, for large on-site defect potential, it is shown that defects induce an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> with density of state characterized by the Wigner semi-circle law. We find that the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> enhances conductivity to the order of 4 e^ 2 /h and explains the absence of strong localization. Furthermore,the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> supports ferromagnetism with the induced magnetic moment approaching 1 μ_B per defect in the limit of infinite quasi-particle lifetime.

40|$|Motivated by {{the idea}} of <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> {{superconductivity}} in heavily Boron doped diamond, we investigate the doping of various elements into diamond to address the question, which <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> can offer a better DOS at the Fermi level. Surprisingly, we find that the vacancy does the best job in producing the largest DOS at the Fermi surface. To investigate the effect of disorder in Anderson localization of the resulting <b>impurity</b> <b>band,</b> we use a simple tight-binding model. Our preliminary study based on the kernel polynomial method shows that the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> is already localized at the concentration of 10 - 3. Around the vacancy concentration of 0. 006 the whole spectrum of diamond becomes localized and quantum percolation takes place. Therefore to achieve conducting bands at concentrations on the scale of 5 - 10 percent, one needs to introduce correlations such as hopping among the vacancies...|$|E
40|$|We analyze microscopically the valence and <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> {{models of}} {{ferromagnetic}} (Ga,Mn) As. We {{find that the}} tight-binding Anderson approach with conventional parameterization and the full potential LDA+U calculations give a very similar picture of states near the Fermi energy which reside in an exchange-split sp-d hybridized valence band with dominant orbital character of the host semiconductor; this microscopic spectral character {{is consistent with the}} physical premise of the k. p kinetic-exchange model. On the other hand, the various models with a band structure comprising an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> detached from the valence band assume mutually incompatible microscopic spectral character. By adapting the tight-binding Anderson calculations individually to each of the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> pictures in the single Mn impurity limit and then by exploring the entire doping range we find that a detached <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> does not persist in any of these models in ferromagnetic (Ga,Mn) As.

40|$|We {{calculate}} {{the density of}} states of a two-dimensional electron gas located at the interface of a strongly disordered GaAlAs/GaAs heterojunction. The disorder potential is created by two delta doped layers. The first layer includes the parent donors which provides the well with electrons and creates a smooth disorder potential. The second layer is doped with either acceptor or donor impurities, and is located inside the well, thus creating a strongly disordered potential. We {{calculate the}} density of states {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field of arbitrary strength by taking into account all perturbative terms in the fifth Klauder's approximation. We find an anharmonic spectrum, strongly asymmetric, for the Landau level density of states. At low field, the attractive potential creates the well-known <b>band</b> tails or <b>impurity</b> <b>bands.</b> At higher field, we show that <b>impurity</b> <b>bands</b> are also created by repulsive potentials.

40|$|An {{infrared}} photoconductor, {{designated as}} the Periodic Extrinsic InfraRed (PEIR) photoconductor, is proposed. A PEIR photoconductor will be useful for detecting wavelengths from 7 μm (1400 cm- 1) to longer than 100 μm (100 cm- 1). Through expitaxial growth, a PEIR photoconductor {{is made up of}} heavily doped layers separated by lightly doped layers. The heavily doped layers are doped such that an <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> forms but are not doped high enough to cause the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> to merge with the condition or valence band. The lightly doped layers are used to confine the carriers in the impurity bands and consequently, conduction can only occur due to carriers excited to the conduction (n-type device) or valence (p-type device) band. Radiation excites the carriers from the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> to the conduction or valence band. The <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> layers are thin enough that even if the electric field in the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> layers is small, there is a high probability the excited carrier will scatter into the lightly doped layer and be swept away by the electric field in the lightly doped layer. ^ A PEIR photoconductor will have two major advantages. First, the absorption coefficient will be high because the high impurity concentration in the <b>impurity</b> <b>band</b> layers. The absorption coefficient will be from 103 cm- 1 to as high as 104 cm- 1. Additionally, a method has been found to approximately determine the highest absorption coefficient attainable in specific host semiconductor:impurity dopant materials systems. Consequently, one can determine the optimum host semiconductor:impurity dopant system to be used in a PEIR photoconductor designed to detect a certain wavelength. Second, some host semiconductors that are being considered are Si and GaAs, which are much easier to work with than HgCdTe (the material of choice for intrinsic photoconductors at wavelengths longer than 7 μm). ...|$|E
