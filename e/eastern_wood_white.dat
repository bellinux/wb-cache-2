5000|$|Leptosia, {{commonly}} called <b>wood</b> <b>whites,</b> is a genus of pierid butterflies from the orangetip tribe (Anthocharini) [...] Leptosia {{are found in}} Africa, except for Leptosia nina, which ranges from India to Australia, and Leptosia lignea, which is found only on Sulawesi. All have a frail appearance and broad rounded wings. They are only distantly related to the Palearctic <b>wood</b> <b>whites</b> Leptidea (Dismorphiinae).|$|R
50|$|The {{size of the}} {{reservation}} may have affected the survey since many of these species are not well detected using the point count method. Neotropical migrant species that typically require large patches of forest to support viable populations are well represented and include ovenbird, black-throated blue warbler, <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> pewee, red-eyed vireo, scarlet tanager, <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> pewee and veery. Neotropical migrants represent {{more than half of}} the species observed and four out of the five most abundant species recorded.|$|R

50|$|RÃ©al's <b>wood</b> <b>white</b> {{has been}} found in many western Europe {{countries}} but has not been found in Britain. In Ireland, where it was only positively identified in 2001, it is more common and far more widespread than the <b>wood</b> <b>white</b> (L. sinapis). Since it looks and behaves like its close relative {{further research is needed to}} discover its true distribution, indeed on the continent its current known distribution is suspiciously patchy. The only conclusive way to separate the two species is by close examination of the genitalia.|$|R
50|$|Species {{include the}} beaver, bobcat, cotton rat, common rat, marsh rice rat, oldfield mouse, <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> rat, coyote, gray fox, red fox, gray squirrel, fox squirrel, marsh rabbit, nine-banded armadillo, opossum, raccoon, river otter and white-tailed deer.|$|R

50|$|It {{is home to}} {{the rare}} <b>wood</b> <b>white</b> butterfly, but the pearl-bordered {{fritillary}} was last recorded in 2007. Rare moths include: argent and sable, common fan-foot, white-line snout, waved carpet and drab looper.|$|R
50|$|Insects species {{found on}} the site include a dance fly (Hilara media) and a wasp (Omallus puncticollis), which are nationally rare; as well as {{uncommon}} butterflies: <b>wood</b> <b>white,</b> pearl-bordered fritillary and the white admiral.|$|R

50|$|The Pemberville Public Library {{serves the}} {{communities}} in <b>eastern</b> <b>Wood</b> County from its administrative offices in Pemberville and branches in Stony Ridge and Luckey.

50|$|The least flycatcher (Empidonax minimus) {{is quite}} similar to the <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> pewee in plumage, but has a bold eye ring and much shorter primary projection, {{appearing}} rather blunt-winged. It also has a shorter bill and is smaller overall. The songs (che-bec, che-bec) and calls (a sharp whit) are very different.|$|R
50|$|The {{breeding}} season of <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> rats {{depends on the}} climate. Those in warmer climates (e.g. Florida and Georgia) can reproduce all year, while <b>eastern</b> <b>wood</b> rats in higher latitudes (e.g. Kansas and Nebraska) breed from early spring to mid fall. Their estrous cycle lasts between 3 and 8 days, while gestation lasts between 32 and 38 days. One to six young are born in each litter, and the female may become pregnant again after a week. Females can have up to three litters in a year, with two being normal. They can also sometimes reproduce in their first year, as they reach sexual maturity before males. Females are solely responsible for the young. Females and males fight when they come across each other. If the male wins, copulation occurs, but if the female wins, the male is usually killed during fighting.|$|R
5|$|Quants, a {{grassland}} clearing in a forestry plantation {{well known}} for its butterflies including Duke of Burgundy, marsh fritillary and <b>wood</b> <b>white,</b> {{is a candidate for}} Special Area of Conservation (cSAC).

50|$|A {{number of}} species {{interact}} with this plant, {{in a number of}} complex relationships, a noted example being Paraepermenia santaliella; the Quandong Moth of the Epermeniidae family.
