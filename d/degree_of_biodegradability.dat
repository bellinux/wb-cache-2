40|$|Heavy metal {{pollution}} of soil {{is a global}} problem. Diffuse contamination of large areas causes particular difficulties, since most classical engineering technology directed at soil decontamination {{is associated with a}} loss of land, and is usually costly. For arable land, in which low to medium level contamination threatens soil fertility and human health in the long term, gentle remediation techniques are required which not only reduce toxicological risks, but also restore soil fertility. In order to overcome these problems, the use of plants to extract metals from soil (Phytoextraction) has repeatedly been suggested as a novel clean-up technology. Phytoextraction using hyperaccumulator plants is usually limited by low biomass, whereas metal uptake by high biomass plants usually suffers from low phytoavailability of the metal. One strategy to overcome these limitations is to enhance metal phytoavailability by the application of chelates. EDTA has been the most commonly used chelating agent for phytoextraction. Its disadvantage, though, is its persistence in the environment. This leads to a high risk of metal leaching into the groundwater. Furthermore, there have been signs of high toxicity towards plants and microorganisms. Various naturally occurring chelating agents, such as natural low molecular weight organic acids (NLMWOA), cyclodextrins (CyD), (S,S) -N,N’-ethylenediamine disuccinic acid (EDDS) and wool in hydrolysed form were selected for use. All these chelating agents have a common denominator, they are synthesised by natural processes, such as microorganisms, plants or animals and are thus biodegradable. The ability of the above mentioned chelating agents to mobilise heavy metals was assessed in slurry and column experiments. Phytotoxicity experiments evaluating the toxic effect of the chelates on plants were succeeded by phytoextraction pot experiments in the greenhouse. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the chelates was evaluated with oxitop and pot experiments. Attention was given on the influence of the chelating agents on the bioavailability of heavy metals during the degradation process. Microorganisms which degrade the applied chelating agents were characterised in the case of NLMWOA. The studied NLMWOA, citric acid, oxalic acid and tartaric acid, displayed low toxicity to plants and high Cu mobilisation effectiveness. The high effectiveness was not confirmed in the phytoextraction experiment, where EDTA, considering the amounts applied was more effective. The reason for this lies in the high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the NLMWOA. All three investigated NLMWOA were degraded by the same microorganisms and displayed a significant pH increase in the soil during the degradation. This pH increase was accompanied by a decrease in the bioavailability of the heavy metals. The CyD revealed a high toxicity towards tobacco and a very low capacity mobilising heavy metals. Additionally a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> was observed. EDDS, compared to EDTA, displayed a higher toxicity to tobacco. Both showed the same effectiveness in mobilising Cd and Cu in a column experiment. In the phytoextraction experiment EDDS increased the uptake of Cu but not of Cd, and both chelates failed to increase the root to shoot translocation rate. EDDS displayed a <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> lower than often currently stated. A replanting of the pots revealed a prolonged toxicity effect of the remaining EDDS in the soil on the seedlings revealing new challenges for the field of chelate assisted phytoextraction. Wool hydrolysate displayed a high efficiency mobilising Cu in soil. Depending on the degree of hydrolysation for the applied wool, it increased the uptake by up to 850 %. It revealed a very high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability,</b> which, moreover was not accompanied by side effects, such as the increase of soil pH, and the accompanied decrease of the bioavailability of the heavy metals. The results from this study demonstrate that hyrolysed wool may be applied as a perfect substitute of the commonly used EDTA for enhancement of phytoextraction. The other tested biochelators, however, are not suitable to replace EDTA...|$|E

40|$|Present work {{primarily}} {{deals with}} the exhaustive investigations of rapid de-lignification processes from source-sorted organic fractions that are recalcitrant in nature. Organic solid wastes (OSW) belongs to the organic fraction of municipal solid wastes (MSW) and they act as enormous potential substrate for alternative source {{of energy in the}} form of bio-fuels. Nevertheless, these substrates are not easily biodegradable and the <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> is solely dependent on the composition & characteristic of organic solid wastes in municipal solid wastes. The component responsible for recalcitrance of organic solid wastes is lignin that occurs in variable amounts in different plant residues.

40|$|Abstract— 17 α-ethynylestradiol (EE 2) is a {{synthetic}} estrogen {{used as a}} key ingredient in an oral contraceptives pill. EE 2 is an endocrine disrupting compound, high in estrogenic potency. Although EE 2 exhibits low <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> with common microorganisms in wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs), this compound can be biotransformed by ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) via a co-metabolism mechanism in WWTPs. This study aimed to investigate the effect of real wastewater on biotransformation of EE 2 by AOB. A preliminary experiment {{on the effect of}} nitrite and pH levels on abiotic transformation of EE 2 suggested that the abiotic transformation occurred at only pH < 6. 8. Biotransformation of EE 2 under the presence of municipal or industrial wastewater demonstrated that different types of wastewater affect EE 2 biotransformation differently. Organic matters in wastewater were believed to deteriorate EE 2 biotransformation via the competition effect. At a lower initial ammonium concentration, EE 2 biotransformation can be retarded and the extent of the deterioration was COD-concentration dependent. However, when an initial ammonium concentration was elevated, thisphenomena disappeared. This is because when increasing the amount of the primary substrate, more AMO enzymes can be produced resulting in unlimited transformation of all compounds in the tests reducing the competitive effect of organic matters on EE 2.

However, the knowledge of these systems is often based on empirical results so to discourage the plant operators for its adoption. This paper discusses and compares the empirical evidence coming from two different alternating membrane bioreactors, a demonstration and a full-scale one. The two plants treat two real municipal wastewaters, rather different for both C:N ratio and <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the influent organics. Nine steady-state runs {{have been carried out}} in the demonstration plant, while a one whole year operation has been considered for the full-scale system.

As a result, the use of the available carbon source, with concern to the total nitrogen removal, was as low as 0. 1 kg of total nitrogen removed per kg of total influent COD. Effluent total nitrogen met the standard for reuse with specific energy consumptions in the range 85 – 109 gTNremoved per kWhconsumed.

40|$|Among {{polymeric}} polycations, Chitosan, {{derived by}} deacetylation of the naturally occurring polysaccharide chitin, has recently {{emerged as a}} suitable material for the preparation of non-viral gene and drug delivery vectors [1]. Chitosan offers many advantages, a high <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and biocompatibility, as well as mucoadhesive and permeability-enhancing properties, but also large availability and relatively low cost. Its properties can be tuned to a considerable extent by simply controlling the degree of deacetylation and polymerization, or the pH-dependent degree of ionization. Moreover, the broad possibility of chitosan structure modification into desired constructs makes it a versatile component for drug delivery system design. In this work, different two-components drug delivery systems formed by a chitosan shell enclosing an inner core, formed by a surfactant vesicle or by a polymeric nanoparticle, have been investigated and proposed as new targeting vectors for skeletal muscle, with potential applications as delivery systems for modulation of myogenic differentiation. Span and Tween non-ionic surfactant vesicles (Niosomes) [2] and polylactic-co-glycolic acid (PLGA) [3] nanoparticles have been coated with chitosan and lactosylated-chitosan at different particle/polymer concentration ratio and have been characterized {{in terms of their}} size, shape, charge and formulation stability by different experimental techniques.

The objective of this work is to introduce a novel type of nanocomposite comprising a natural fibre reinforcing agent impregnated with copper nanoparticles, and to control the biodegradability of this sustainable material using {{the function of the}} impregnated copper nanoparticles. At room temperature, copper nanoparticles were synthesized and impregnated into palm oil fibre to improve the strength and durability of the fibre and the material {{properties of}} the composite. Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic techniques were used to characterize the prepared composites. The biodegradability (minimum to maximum boundary) of the composite was studied (using the soil burial test) {{as a function of the}} quantity of copper nanoparticles, where the tensile strength was fixed at the maximum. The property of biodegradability was also optimized with the help of response surface methodology. The biodegradability of the developed composites ranged from 26. 72 to 6. 51 % when the concentration of impregnated copper nanoparticles was varied from 0 to 2590 μg g− 1 respectively. The results indicate that copper nanoparticles can be considered as a potential biocide in composite materials and in this work for controlling the biodegradability of the material by varying the quantity of impregnated copper. The relationship between the responses and variables selected in this study has been justified by the predicted models. Moreover, the model terms have been explained and the prediction has also been performed successfully.

Industrial trial production was done using composition containing of LDPE with 5 % chitosan and 3 % papain by weight. Soil burial test results showed that specimens degraded by 60 % in a six month period, while complete degradation occurred after one year.

Solar photo-Fenton treatment was performed in Compound Parabolic Collector pilot-plants, and biological treatment in an immobilized biomass reactor pilot-plant. Analytical determinations included the measurement of dissolved organic carbon, chemical oxygen demand, inorganic compounds (chloride, ammonium, nitrate), formed during degradation, acute toxicity tests applying Vibrio Fischeri luminescence bacteria and the Zahn-Wellens biodegradability test. The synthetic wastewater contained 200 mg/L of each compound, an initial DOC of 200 mg/l and an initial COD of 700 mg/L. The target compounds proved to be susceptible to complete degradation and partial mineralization (95 %) by photo-Fenton.

40|$|Peat based {{growing media}} are not {{sustainable}} and not easily colonized by biocontrol organisms. Plant fibers may allow for partially replacing peat in growing media {{and they may}} have the potential to carry biocontrol organisms. However, they may also carry plant pathogens and they may vary in their <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> and their interaction with N, and thus they may affect the quality of growing media. Several defiberization techniques were tested for flax shives, miscanthus and reed straw for their ability to (1) kill plant pathogens present on the plant fibers, (2) reduce the N-fixation risk of the fibers and (3) provide fibers serving as carrier of biocontrol fungi. Flax shives obtained from various sources were colonized by viable microsclerotia of the plant pathogen Verticillium dahliae. However, when sufficiently high temperatures were reached during defiberization, this technique killed the plant pathogen on the shives, allowing the use of defiberized flax shives in growing media. Untreated flax shives, miscanthus or reed straw were characterized by high N immobilization. Using these plant fibers as peat replacement in growing media may thus reduce N availability for plants. According to the incubation trials results, extruding, retruding and applying disc refining significantly reduced the N immobilization for miscanthus straw without affecting the pH of the fiber, while steam explosion significantly reduced the pH and resulted in higher N immobilisation. Extruding and retruding the flas shives increased the N fixation. Defiberized pure miscanthus or reed straw and flax shives were easily colonized by fungal biocontrol strains, e. g. Trichoderma spp.. The effect of inoculation with fungi or acidification on N fixation was tested for extruded miscanthus fibers. Inoculation with shiitake (Lentinula edodes) or Agrocybe aegerita, i. e., 2 fungi without biocontrol properties was effective in reducing the N immobilization only in a specific pH range and at high colonization degree and/or for fungi with fast colonization, but never increased the N fixation when successfully inoculated. Inoculation of extruded Miscanthus fibers with different strains of biocontrol fungi did not increase nor decrease the N immobilization. Reducing the pH of the fibers between pH 2. 5 and 4. 7 was effective in reducing the microbial activity and the N fixation. Finetuning the conditions is necessary when applying acidification or inoculation for reducing the N fixation in plant fibers. N immobilization in growing media is related to biological activity. We compared 3 methods to determine the microbial biomass on plant fibers in growing media incubated with mineral N fertilizers, i. e., fumigation-extraction, plfa and Q-PCR, and used water-extractable C to measure the easily available C in the plant fibers. The extrusion of miscanthus straw with or without inoculation of a biocontrol organism reduced the N immobilization when compared with the pure fiber. In case of flax shives, defiberization of plant fibers kills plant pathogens that may be present on the fibers when sufficiently high temperatures are reached during defiberization. Inoculation of plant fibers with biocontrol fungi may be beneficial for increasing the disease resistance in growing media, and we found that inoculation of extruded Miscanthus fibers with biocontrol fungi did not increase nor decrease the N immobilization.

Après décembre 2001, pour le débit moyen turbiné (près de 200 m 3 /s), l'efficacité d'aération du seuil a baissé de près de 10 % (gain de 80 % en oxygène dissous et élimination de 70 % et 75 % du méthane dissous). Après février 2003, pour un débit de 100 m 3 /s, 75 % du déficit amont en oxygène dissous est comblé et près de 70 % du méthane dissous éliminé. From {{the moment}} tropical reservoirs are impounded, climatic conditions cause rapid (within several weeks) and marked thermal stratification, especially during the dry season. This phenomenon is further exacerbated by the chemical and biochemical processes {{taking place in the}} reservoir due to the decomposition of submerged organic matter. In dense tropical forests, the overhead biomass is estimated at roughly 170 t(C) /ha, and the carbon contained in the soil is also not negligible since it is on the order of 100 t(C) /ha. The <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> <b>biodegradability</b> of the different compounds in the flooded biomass is variable, ranging from a few weeks for bacteria to several centuries for tree trunks. The studies carried out at Petit Saut (French Guiana) show that, immediately after impoundment, only the epilimnion (a few dozen centimetres thick) was oxygenated whereas the hypolimnion was characterized by complete anoxia and a very high methane content (about 15 mg/L). Water quality in the river downstream from the reservoir was of course strongly linked to variations in the water quality in the reservoir as well as to its operating mode. The waters passing through the turbines, coming from the bottom layers, were anoxic and loaded with fixed or volatile reducing compounds (e. g., CH 4, H 2 S), and were responsible for a high immediate or progressive oxygen demand. At Petit Saut, despite an inflow of good quality water, there has been a progressive deoxygenation in the river downstream due to the high methane content (roughly 8 mg/L) of the turbined water. Thus, 40 km downstream from the dam, the oxygen content was less than 2 mg/L and therefore incompatible with most aquatic life. To solve this problem, it was necessary to build an aerating weir capable of reoxygenating the turbined waters and, more importantly, eliminating reducing gases such as methane at the same time. The function of the overflow weir was to entrain air bubbles into the water and to give these bubbles a sufficiently long immersion time to ensure that they dissolve. At the time of its installation, only three examples of oxygenating weirs existed in the entire world, all located in the United States. The weir configuration was tested using a physical model to qualitatively examine the form of the flow both across the weir and downstream from it. The degree to which air bubbles were entrained in the water was also tested, but not the question of evaluating the flux of gaseous exchanges between the air and the water. The system that was finally designed by EDF, in October 1994, was a metallic weir with two consecutive falls, the configuration of which respected the main physical criteria that {{play a significant role in}} the oxygenation of water, i. e. :- the height of the falls (roughly 5. 40 m, depending on the flow rate);- the thickness of the water stream, the function of which is to entrain air bubbles and keep them in the water for a sufficiently long period of time for the oxygen to dissolve (between 12 and 25 seconds, depending on the flow rate); - the dimensions of the receiving basin of the first waterfall where the air bubbles are held (5 hexagonal alveoli); and- systems to promote the fragmentation of the flow. This structure was placed in the tailrace channel of the plant, approximately 100 m downstream from the main dam. This location protected it from floods and did not create an extra obstacle in the river. In addition, it allowed the water to be re-oxygenated as soon as it left the reservoir. The efficiency of the two waterfalls of the Petit Saut re-aerating weir was tested at two different turbine flow rates: 80 m 3 /s and 230 m 3 /s. In 1996, the results of the measurements showed that for a flow rate of 230 m 3 /s, upstream of the weir the concentrations of CH 4 were around 5 mg/L and dissolved oxygen was 0. 8 mg/L. Downstream from the weir CH 4 concentrations were 1. 3 mg/L and dissolved oxygen concentrations were 6. 8 mg/L. The dissolved methane elimination rate was approximately 75 per cent. At a flow rate of 80 m 3 /s, upstream of the weir the concentration of CH 4 was 5. 5 mg/L and the dissolved oxygen concentration was 0. 7 mg/L. Downstream from the weir concentrations of CH 4 and dissolved oxygen were 1. 0 mg/L and 7. 1 mg/L, respectively. The dissolved methane elimination rate was around 80 %. The efficiency of the re-oxygenation was always greater than 90 %. These data prove that the efficiency of the Petit Saut weir installation was higher when the turbine flow rate was lower. This could be due to a greater waterfall height, the better entrainment of air bubbles per unit volume and/or a longer air bubble residence time in the downstream flow. Between December 2001 and February 2003, for a flow rate of 200 m 3 /s, the efficiency of the weir decreased by 10 %, with the dissolved methane elimination rate at around 70 - 75 %. The level of re-oxygenation was around 80 %. Since February 2003, for a flow rate of 100 m 3 /s, the efficiency of the weir has decreased by 10 %, the dissolved methane elimination rate was around 70 % and the level of re-oxygenation was around 75 %. On a local scale, the effect on the quality of the river water has been very positive, as aquatic life has been maintained. Without the weir, the methane contained in the turbined water would have been progressively transformed, along the course of the river, into carbon dioxide. In the absence of significant additions of good quality water and without the weir, a large part of the course of the river would have a dissolved oxygen content of less than 2 mg/L, the critical threshold for the maintenance of aquatic life. At present time, the results of the current ecological survey are used to support studies on biogeochemical processes...|$|E

30|$|The {{development}} of a new test method suited for the assessment <b>of</b> the anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> surfactant under sewage plant simulation conditions is based on an analysis of the existing methods, which are summarized in the Fraunhofer Report on the “Anaerobic Degradation of Detergent Surfactants” to the EU Commission (2002). As the most promising basis, the test method according to DIN 38414, part 8 was chosen. The test method was modified in that way that an accurately known amount of the test substance is added to the sludge inoculum, and that the test substance is added in two sequential steps to overcome possible interferences from unspecific digester gas formation caused by the surface-activity of the surfactant test substance. By measuring the difference in the gas volumes produced (after the second addition of the test substance) in the sludge inoculum plus test substance and the corresponding control (sludge inoculum only) and converting the gas volumes to the percentage <b>degree</b> <b>of</b> biodegradation, this test allows the quantification <b>of</b> the anaerobic <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> the test substance.|$|R

Eight different types of synthetic detergent powders were selected. LAS contents of the selected products were measured according to ASTM D 3049 - 89 standard. The biodegradability was measured as the reduction percentage of LAS initially present within a specific period. The phosphate content in the detergents were measured by SLS 760 1986 method and the pH of the media also was obtained to find any relationship between these parameters. The results found that the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> LAS in detergent powder is ranged between 24 - 79. This study found that the <b>biodegradability</b> <b>of</b> anionic surfactants highly depend on the phosphate content of the product. According to SLS 7601986 minimum LAS which has to be maintained in the Sri Lankan synthetic detergent and the existing legislations for the manufacturing marketing and consuming of detergent products should have modified for the health and safety environment.
