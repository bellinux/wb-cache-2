40|$|Background and Purpose: Neuropeptide Y (NPY), one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} neuropeptides found in the central nervous system (CNS), has been implicated in the regulation of many metabolism. Preproneuropeptide Y (PPNPY) is the signal peptide of the NPY. Effect of PPNPY Leu 7 Pro polymorphism on metabolic disorder is widely discussed and still controversial. Material and methods: To study the functional aberration in the human wild and mutate types of PPNPY in pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes is hard. Here, the author used a new gene ontology technology to predict the molecular function of human wild and mutate types of PPNPY. Results: Here, {{it can be seen that}} there is no functional difference between wild and mutate types of PPNPY. The common functions as Receptor binding, G-protein coupled receptor binding, hormone activity, neuropeptide hormone activity, G-protein coupled receptor activity, calcium channel regulator activity can be seen. Conclusion: This can support the null effect of this polymorphism in clinical findings of the patients. Therefore, this polymorphism might not be an important factor and have null effect in metabolic disorder. Finally, the author <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> for a further study to analyze other know genetic variants within PPNPY gene to add more knowledge...|$|E

40|$|This {{study is}} an {{empirical}} investigation {{on the role}} of the Islamic Development Bank (IDB) Group through its foreign aid activities in contributing to the economic growth of African countries, especially the African Muslim Countries (AMCs). The AMCs, which is serving as the sample countries for this study constitute more than two-third of the IDB member countries from Africa. Therefore, this study provides empirical evidences from AMCs like Algeria, Burkina Faso, Egypt, Senegal, Niger, Morocco and Tunisia among others, on the impact of its development assistance (DA) on the economic growth of these countries using balanced panel data of six years average from 1987 - 2010. In order to accomplish the objectives of this paper, Simultaneous Equations Model (SEM) was adopted and Seemingly Unrelated Regressions Estimate (SURE) method was utilized for its estimation. In view of this, the findings from this study revealed that the DA of IDB has positive impact on the economic growth of AMCs through investment as the major transmission mechanism. Moreover, the impacts of the DA on human capital were more than that of investment and growth. This paper <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> that the IDB should give more attention to these important transmission mechanisms, since they are among the expected gains of foreign aid to LDCs as theoretically advanced in the literature and empirically established.

40|$|Background: Violence {{against women}} is a {{universal}} phenomenon that persists in all communities and in all {{countries of the world}} and the perpetrator of that violence is often well-known to the victim. Domestic violence in particular continues to be frighteningly common and well-accepted as "normal" within too many societies. Objectives: (1) The primary aim of this study is to find out the extent of different type of domestic violence and to identify various risk factors for domestic violence against married women. (2) The secondary aim is to identify the various protective factors of domestic violence against married women. Materials and Methods: The present study was a population based cross-sectional study carried out in the urban area of Gwalior city for a period of one year. Stratified random sampling technique was used for the selection of the samples. The study participants were interviewed using a pretested semi-structured open-ended questionnaire. Proportion, Pearson′s, chi-square test and odds ratio were calculated for the analysis of the study. Result: Of the 144 study participants, 68 participants reported some form of domestic violence, which was either physical, sexual or emotional. The most common type of violence reported was physical violence. The most important risk factor for domestic violence was alcoholism followed by literacy status. Majority of the abused women were dependent on their husbands for money, material assets and expenditure. Conclusion: The study <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> that to prevent domestic violence government has to take stringent action for making women more self-reliant especially by making the women more literate and more financially independent...|$|E
40|$|In {{the report}} of late 2001 Safe, What is Safe?, SWOV {{indicated}} how the annual number of traffic casualties could be reduced considerably. These proposals were {{to be regarded as}} an addition to the proposals as were developed in the then National Traffic and Transport Plan of the Ministry of Transport. In Safe, What is Safe?, besides a speeding-up of the construction of a sustainably-safe infrastrucure, a qualitatively better implementation was advocated. During the last few years, the introduction of Sustainably-Safe has become widespread. What the layout of a sustainably-safe road infrastructure should preferably look like has, in the meantime, become generally well known; it can be found in various publications about this subject. Apart from this, it should be noted that, for by no means all layout elements, is known precisely a) how they influence the accident chance, and b) the extent to which this chance would change if a preferable layout was deviated from. A second problem yet to be solved is that not all Sustainably-Safe principles have been transformed into design requirements. In particular, requirements for being able to plan sustainably-safe road networks are missing. A third problem refers to the realisation of a sustainably-safe infrastructure. In practice it seems that it is not always so simple to meet the requirements and to decide whether the actual, practical experiences already indicate the need to modify the requirements. The underlying question in this is whether a greater road safety improvement in the Netherlands can be achieved if a higher quality implementation of a sustainably-safe infrastructure was achieved. This study attempts to investigate {{the extent to which the}} current and planned road infrastructures meet the Sustainably-Safe requirements. To do this, both the network features (road categorizing) and the road segment and crossroads features have been tested. This testing was carried out in a region in the Netherlands (part of the southern province of Limburg). Based on this sample, there is, at the most, an indication for the situation in the whole country; there is no reason to suppose that the situation in that part of Limburg differs widely. SWOV has formulated new draft requirements for network features. These additional requirements concern the function of a connection in an area, the crossroads type, the detour factor, and the route choice. SWOV recommends including these requirements in the next review. Our study shows that, to a large extent, the tested network meets the requirements made. However, it is striking that only a limited number of intersections of two distributor roads now meet the current requirement, namely a roundabout. In this study, an extensive addition to the layout requirements was also drawn up for crossroads and road sections. Most of these requirements can be traced back to the requirement that certain conflicts on a Sustainably-Safe road category should not occur and, if a conflict cannot be avoided, only small speed differences are permitted. SWOV <b>hereby</b> <b>recommends</b> that these extra features be added to the existing requirements. Our study shows that the tested road network sometimes scores well, whereas other features score less well. That is why SWOV recommends examining why there is such a large spread in the results. In this situation, SWOV further recommends, for a limited number of requirements (namely those for which there are strong indications that they have a relation with severe accidents), that such agreements be made that they will always be met. The present study indicates that there is a need for such agreements...|$|E

Cattle older than 3 years had a higher prevalence rate compared to age groups 2 - 3 years, 1 - 2 years, and less than 1 year. The prevalence rate was higher in cattle densely populated locations. Infection rate differs between herds with larger herds presenting high prevalence due to poor sanitary practice. It is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended</b> that public enlightenment on adequate control and preventive measures using proper sanitary practice and calf hood vaccination are required. 1...|$|R
40|$|Public {{programs}} for population dispersal are usually based on macro approaches {{to economic development}} in the target area. Such programs have failed to reach their goals in many countries, and, therefore, there is a demand for knowledge regarding alternative forms of intervention. In this paper an innovative micro approach is suggested, the principles of {{which are based on}} findings reported in the economic and sociological literature on individual migration decisions. This approach was implemented in the central Galilee region in Israel. In the early 1980 s fifty-two small communities were established in the Galilee, each with a unique organizational, social, and economic structure suited to the specific requirements and expectations of its settlers. The plan succeeded in attracting the desired type of population (young, highly educated) to the region, and the newcomers viewed the new communities as their permanent homes. Based on this experience and on the analysis of relevant literature, a development strategy of tailor made community planning is <b>hereby</b> <b>recommended</b> for future projects. It is especially appropriate in the context of developed countries with a slow to zero population growth and with spreading social norms of the postindustrial society. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—In {{this paper}} we {{investigated}} {{a number of}} the Internet congestion control algorithms that has been developed in the last few years. It was obviously found that many of these algorithms were designed to deal with the Internet traffic merely as a train of consequent packets. Other few algorithms were specifically tailored to handle the Internet congestion caused by running media traffic that represents audiovisual content. This later set of algorithms is considered {{to be aware of the}} nature of this media content. In this context we briefly explained a number of congestion control algorithms and hence categorized them into the two following categories: i) Media congestion control algorithms. ii) Common congestion control algorithms. We <b>hereby</b> <b>recommend</b> the usage of the media congestion control algorithms for the reason of being media content-aware rather than the other common type of algorithms that blindly manipulates such traffic. We showed that the spread of such media content-aware algorithms over Internet will lead to better congestion control status in the coming years. This is due to the observed emergence of the era of digital convergence where the media traffic type will form the majority of the Internet traffic. Keywords—Congestion Control, Media Traffic.
