Also about half way up the donga, for really it was nothing more, at a {{distance}} of perhaps five and twenty paces from its <b>flat</b> <b>point</b> whence the condemned were hurled, a circular space of ground had been cleared and levelled which was large enough to accommodate fifty or sixty men.

Night fell as we were going out of the 'Upper River' and meeting the floods of the Ohio. We dashed along without anxiety; for the hidden rock which used to lie right in the way has moved up stream a long {{distance}} out of the channel; or rather, about one county has gone into the river from the Missouri point, and the Cairo point has 'made down' and added to its long tongue of territory correspondingly. The Mississippi is a just and equitable river; it never tumbles one man's farm overboard without building a new farm just like it for that man's neighbor. This keeps down hard feelings.|$|E

60|$|My friend Jordan chose a {{fine day}} for his excursion, and, embarking {{in a boat}} with six or seven men, sailed a few miles down the St. Lawrence, till {{he came to a}} low <b>flat</b> <b>point.</b> In a small bay near this he drew up the boat, and then went into the woods with his party, where each man cut a large pole or club. Arming {{themselves}} with these, they waited until the tide receded and left the point dry. In a short time one or two seals crawled out of the sea to bask upon the shore; soon several more appeared, and ere long a band of more than a hundred lay sunning themselves upon the beach. The ambuscade now prepared to attack the enemy. Creeping stealthily down as near as possible without being discovered, they simultaneously rushed upon the astonished animals; and the tragic scene of slaughter, mingled with melodramatic and comic incidents, that ensued, baffles all description. In one place might be seen my friend Jordan swinging a huge club round with his powerful arms, and dealing death and destruction at every blow; while in another place a poor weazened-looking Scotchman (who had formerly been a tailor! and to whom the work was new) advanced, with cautious trepidation, towards a huge seal, which spluttered and splashed fearfully in its endeavours to reach the sea, and dealt it a blow on the back. He might as well have hit a rock. The slight rap had only the effect of making the animal show its teeth; at which sight the tailor retreated precipitately, and, striking his heel against a rock, fell backwards into a pool of water, where he rolled over and over--impressed, apparently, with the idea that he was attacked by all the seals in the sea. His next essay, however, was more successful, and in a few minutes he killed several, having learned to hit on the head instead of on the back. In {{less than a quarter of}} an hour they killed between twenty and thirty seals, which were stowed in the boat and conveyed to the post.|$|E

50|$|In general, {{a pointed}} {{projectile}} {{will have a}} better drag coefficient (Cd) or ballistic coefficient (BC) than a round nosed bullet, and a round nosed bullet {{will have a better}} Cd or BC than a <b>flat</b> <b>point</b> bullet. Large radius curves, resulting in a shallower point angle, will produce lower drags, particularly at supersonic velocities. Hollow point bullets behave much like a <b>flat</b> <b>point</b> of the same point diameter. Projectiles designed for supersonic use often have a slightly tapered base at the rear, called a boat tail, which reduces air resistance in flight. Cannelures, which are recessed rings around the projectile used to crimp the projectile securely into the case, will cause an increase in drag.|$|E
