25|$|Fluorescence is {{observed}} in the atmosphere when the air is under energetic electron bombardment. In cases such as the natural aurora, high-altitude nuclear explosions, and rocket-borne <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> experiments, the molecules and ions formed have a fluorescent response to light.|$|E
25|$|A LEED {{detector}} usually contains {{three or}} four hemispherical concentric grids and a phosphor screen or other position-sensitive detector. The grids are used for screening out the inelastically scattered electrons. Most new LEED systems use a reverse view scheme, which has a minimized <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> and the pattern is viewed from behind through a transmission screen and a viewport. Recently, a new digitized position sensitive detector called a delay-line detector with better dynamic range and resolution has been developed.|$|E

40|$|The Tevatron Electron Lenses (TELs) were {{installed}} {{to mitigate the}} effects of electromagnetic long-range and head-on interactions of high intensity proton and antiproton beams. These phenomena account for significant beam loss and lifetime limitations in the Tevatron Collider operation. The <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> and their drivers are key components of the TELs. They define the possible modes of operation and overall performance of the TELs. We report on the recent development of the <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> and the gun driver for the Tevatron Electron Lenses...|$|R
25|$|In the <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> {{monochromatic}} electrons are {{emitted by}} a cathode filament {{which is at}} a negative potential, typically 10-600 V, {{with respect to the}} sample. The electrons are accelerated and focused into a beam, typically about 0.1 to 0.5mm wide, by a series of electrodes serving as electron lenses. Some of the electrons incident on the sample surface are backscattered elastically, and diffraction can be detected if sufficient order exists on the surface. This typically requires a region of single crystal surface as wide as the electron beam, although sometimes polycrystalline surfaces such as highly oriented pyrolytic graphite (HOPG) are sufficient.|$|E
25|$|Another {{solution}} would be to use a single screen, but break it up into a pattern of closely spaced colored phosphors instead of an even coating of white. Three receivers would be used, each sending its output to a separate <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> aimed at its colored phosphor. Although obvious, this solution was not practical. The electron guns used in monochrome televisions had limited resolution, and if one wanted to retain the resolution of existing monochrome displays, the guns would {{have to focus on}} individual dots three times smaller. This was beyond {{the state of the art}} at the time.|$|E
25|$|The shown {{images are}} {{examples}} of LEED diffraction patterns. The difference between image 1 and 2 is remarkable; where image 1 is of a clean (100) platinum-rhodium single crystal, and image 2 of the same crystal with CO adsorbed on the surface. The original surface order of the clean crystal is clearly visible in image 1, it shows a C(1x1) structure; the extra spots in image 2 are caused by the CO {{on the surface and}} are an example of a C(2x2) structure. The diffraction spots are generated by acceleration of elastically scattered electrons onto a hemispherical fluorescent screen, a retarding field analyzer. In the middle one can see the bright spot of the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> which generates the primary electron beam.|$|E
40|$|Active {{control of}} the {{potential}} of the ISEE- 1 satellite by the use of <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> is reviewed. The <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> contain a special cathode capable of emitting an electron current selectable between 10 to the - 8 th power and 10 to the - 3 rd power at energies from approximately. 6 to 41 eV. Results obtained during flight show that the satellite potential can be stabilized at a value more positive than the normally positive floating potential. The <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> also reduce the spin modulation of the spacecraft potential which is due to the aspect dependent photoemission of the long booms. Plasma parameters like electron temperature and density can be deduced from the variation of the spacecraft potential {{as a function of the}} gun current. The effects of electron beam emission on other experiments are briefly mentioned...|$|R

40|$|There are {{a growing}} number of {{applications}} for CW electron accelerators, many requiring high average current and small transverse and longitudinal emittances. Very high voltage DC <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> with photoemission cathodes are a natural choice for generating the beams for these machines. High average current applications require high quantum efficiency photocathodes at practical wavelengths. The necessary lasers are state-of-the-art systems that must be considered in choosing a photocathode. Field emission from the electrode structures limits the operating voltage and cathode field gradient in these guns. The photocathode operational lifetime is limited by the gun vacuum and by ion back bombardment. Recent developments in areas as diverse as vacuum technology, CW lasers with RF time structure, and the reduction of field emission from large area electrodes show promise {{for the development of a}} new generation of DC photoemission <b>electron</b> <b>guns,</b> operating at very high voltage and cathode field strengths well above those obtainable in the past. These developments, and various designs for very high voltage photoemission <b>electron</b> <b>guns,</b> will be reviewed...|$|R
25|$|Flood beam CRTs {{are small}} tubes that are {{arranged}} as pixels for large screens like Jumbotrons. The first screen using this technology {{was introduced by}} Mitsubishi Electric for the 1980 Major League Baseball All-Star Game. It differs from a normal CRT in that the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> within does not produce a focused controllable beam. Instead, electrons are sprayed in a wide cone across the entire front of the phosphor screen, basically making each unit act as a single light bulb. Each one is coated with a red, green or blue phosphor, {{to make up the}} color sub-pixels. This technology has largely been replaced with light emitting diode displays. Unfocused and undeflected CRTs were used as grid-controlled stroboscope lamps since 1958.|$|E
25|$|Further {{advances}} in computing led to greater advancements in interactive computer graphics. In 1959, the TX-2 computer was developed at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory. The TX-2 integrated {{a number of}} new man-machine interfaces. A light pen could be used to draw sketches on the computer using Ivan Sutherland's revolutionary Sketchpad software. Using a light pen, Sketchpad allowed one to draw simple shapes on the computer screen, save them and even recall them later. The light pen itself had a small photoelectric cell in its tip. This cell emitted an electronic pulse whenever it was placed {{in front of a computer}} screen and the screen's <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> fired directly at it. By simply timing the electronic pulse with the current location of the <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> it was easy to pinpoint exactly where the pen was on the screen at any given moment. Once that was determined, the computer could then draw a cursor at that location. Sutherland seemed to find the perfect solution for many of the graphics problems he faced. Even today, many standards of computer graphics interfaces got their start with this early Sketchpad program. One example of this is in drawing constraints. If one wants to draw a square for example, they do not have to worry about drawing four lines perfectly to form the edges of the box. One can simply specify that they want to draw a box, and then specify the location and size of the box. The software will then construct a perfect box, with the right dimensions and at the right location. Another example is that Sutherland's software modeled objects - not just a picture of objects. In other words, with a model of a car, one could change the size of the tires without affecting the rest of the car. It could stretch the body of car without deforming the tires.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{limitations}} in the dimensional precision with which CRTs can be manufactured economically, {{it has not}} been practically possible to build color CRTs in which three electron beams could be aligned to hit phosphors of respective color in acceptable coordination, {{solely on the basis of}} the geometric configuration of the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> axes and gun aperture positions, shadow mask apertures, etc. The shadow mask ensures that one beam will only hit spots of certain colors of phosphors, but minute variations in physical alignment of the internal parts among individual CRTs will cause variations in the exact alignment of the beams through the shadow mask, allowing some electrons from, for example, the red beam to hit, say, blue phosphors, unless some individual compensation is made for the variance among individual tubes.|$|E
50|$|The name Trinitron {{was derived}} from trinity, meaning the union of three, and tron from {{electron}} tube, after {{the way that the}} Trinitron combined the three separate <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> of other CRT designs into one.|$|R
40|$|New type of high {{perveance}} <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> with convex cathode {{has been}} developed. Three guns {{described in this}} article are built to provide transverse electron current density distributions needed for Electron Lenses for beam-beam compensation in the Tevatron collider. The current distribution can be controlled either by the gun geometry or by voltage on a special control electrode located near cathode. We present the designs of the guns and report results of beam measurements on the test bench. Because of their high current density and low transverse temperature of <b>electrons,</b> <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> of this type can be used in electron cooling and beam-beam compensation devices...|$|R

25|$|The {{vacuum system}} for {{evacuating}} a TEM to an operating pressure level consists of several stages. Initially, a low or roughing vacuum is achieved {{with either a}} rotary vane pump or diaphragm pumps setting a sufficiently low pressure to allow the operation of a turbo-molecular or diffusion pump establishing high vacuum level necessary for operations. To allow for the low vacuum pump to not require continuous operation, while continually operating the turbo-molecular pumps, the vacuum side of a low-pressure pump may be connected to chambers which accommodate the exhaust gases from the turbo-molecular pump. Sections of the TEM may be isolated {{by the use of}} pressure-limiting apertures to allow for different vacuum levels in specific areas such as a higher vacuum of 10−4 to 10−7 Pa or higher in the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> in high-resolution or field-emission TEMs.|$|E
25|$|Nonconducting {{specimens}} may be imaged {{without coating}} using an environmental SEM (ESEM) or low-voltage mode of SEM operation. In ESEM instruments the specimen {{is placed in}} a relatively high-pressure chamber and the electron optical column is differentially pumped to keep vacuum adequately low at the <b>electron</b> <b>gun.</b> The high-pressure region around the sample in the ESEM neutralizes charge and provides an amplification of the secondary electron signal. Low-voltage SEM is typically conducted in an FEG-SEM because field emission guns (FEG) are capable of producing high primary electron brightness and small spot size even at low accelerating potentials. To prevent charging of non-conductive specimens, operating conditions must be adjusted such that the incoming beam current is equal to sum of outcoming secondary and backscattered electrons currents a condition that is more often met at accelerating voltages of 0.3–4 kV.|$|E
25|$|Magnification in a SEM can be {{controlled}} over a range of about 6 orders of magnitude from about 10 to 500,000 times. Unlike optical and transmission electron microscopes, image magnification in an SEM is not {{a function of the}} power of the objective lens. SEMs may have condenser and objective lenses, but their function is to focus the beam to a spot, and not to image the specimen. Provided the <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> can generate a beam with sufficiently small diameter, an SEM could in principle work entirely without condenser or objective lenses, although it might not be very versatile or achieve very high resolution. In an SEM, as in scanning probe microscopy, magnification results from the ratio of the dimensions of the raster on the specimen and the raster on the display device. Assuming that the display screen has a fixed size, higher magnification results from reducing the size of the raster on the specimen, and vice versa. Magnification is therefore controlled by the current supplied to the x, y scanning coils, or the voltage supplied to the x, y deflector plates, and not by objective lens power.|$|E

50|$|From the 1920s to the 1960s, {{virtually}} every electronic device used hot cathode vacuum tubes. Today, hot cathodes {{are used as}} the source of electrons in fluorescent lamps, vacuum tubes, and <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> in cathode ray tubes and laboratory equipment such as electron microscopes.|$|R
25|$|When {{the main}} <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> writes an image to the screen, the {{energy in the}} main beam is {{sufficient}} to create a 'potential relief' on the storage mesh. The areas where this relief is created no longer repel the electrons from the flood gun which now pass through the mesh and illuminate the phosphor screen. Consequently, the image that was briefly traced out by the main gun continues to be displayed after it has occurred. The image can be 'erased' by resupplying the external voltage to the mesh restoring its constant potential. The time for which the image can be displayed was limited because, in practice, the flood gun slowly neutralises the charge on the storage mesh. One way of allowing the image to be retained for longer is temporarily {{to turn off the}} flood gun. It is then possible for the image to be retained for several days. The majority of storage tubes allow for a lower voltage to be applied to the storage mesh which slowly restores the initial charge state. By varying this voltage a variable persistence is obtained. Turning off the flood gun and the voltage supply to the storage mesh allows such a tube to operate as a conventional oscilloscope tube.|$|E
500|$|The red {{component}} of color television cathode ray tubes is typically emitted from an yttria (...) or yttrium oxide sulfide (...) host lattice doped with europium (III) cation (Eu3+) phosphors. The red color itself is emitted from the europium while the yttrium collects {{energy from the}} <b>electron</b> <b>gun</b> and passes it to the phosphor. Yttrium compounds can serve as host lattices for doping with different lanthanide cations. Tb3+ {{can be used as}} a doping agent to produce green luminescence.

500|$|Another {{change was}} due to {{every part of the}} {{equipment}} having different power requirements. The tubes for the transmitter used 6V to heat their filaments, but 4V was needed for the receiver tubes and 2V for the filament of the CRT. The CRT also [...] needed 800V for its <b>electron</b> <b>gun,</b> but the transmitter tubes 1000V for their modulators (drivers). At first, the team used motor-generator sets placed in the Anson and Battle fuselages, or batteries connected in various ways as in the earliest sets in the Heyfords. Bowen decided the solution was to build a power supply that would produce all of these DC voltages from a single 240V 50Hz supply using transformers and rectifiers. This would allow them to power the radar systems using mains power while the aircraft were on the ground.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{vacuum in}} the {{polarized}} photoguns at Jefferson Lab {{is crucial to}} long lifetime operation of the polarized source. In order to characterize the vacuum in these guns, an extractor gauge and a residual gas analyzer have been incorporated into each gun. The purpose of this tech note is to document the gun vacuum measurements performed in the CEBAF polarized <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> during tests made in February 2003, and to compare this with the previous vacuum measurements made in the <b>electron</b> <b>guns</b> throughout their evolution. The results of these measurements, suggesting that the raw extractor gauge readings are 7 x 10 - 12 and 4 x 10 - 12 for guns 2 and 3 respectively, {{are at least as}} good as any previous measurement of the vacuum in these systems...|$|R

The gun is designed to create a beam of electrons exiting from the assembly at some given angle, known as the gun divergence semi-angle, α.
