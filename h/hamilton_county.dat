5|$|NY365 is {{the only}} post-1930 state route that once entered <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County,</b> but no longer does. When it was {{assigned}} , the route entered <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County</b> from Herkimer County, overlapping with NY28 until Blue Mountain Lake. Here, it turned off NY28 and onto NY10 (later NY30) and NY28N. The three routes overlapped to Long Lake, where NY28N split off from both NY10 and NY365. The two highways continued northward, leaving <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County</b> and passing into Franklin County north of Long Lake. NY365 was truncated in the late 1950s to end near the Oneida County village of Holland Patent, eliminating a series of overlaps between NY365 and other state routes that collectively extended from Holland Patent to Plattsburgh, Clinton County.|$|E
5|$|Four {{other state}} routes once entered <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County,</b> {{but no longer}} do. Two of these routes—NY80 and NY365—were simply {{truncated}} out of the county, while two others—NY10A and NY54—no longer exist.|$|E

5|$|NY54 was a {{circuitous}} east–west {{route that}} extended from Utica, Oneida County, to Fonda, Montgomery County, via Speculator and Benson. It entered <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County</b> from Herkimer County on modern NY8 and proceeded east through Speculator to Wells, where it turned south to follow {{what is now}} NY30 to the Fulton County line. It was assigned in the mid-1920s and split into several routes, including NY8 and NY30, in the 1930 renumbering.|$|E

5|$|The Fulton Chain Lakes which NY28 {{has been}} {{following}} extend into <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County.</b> The highway soon reaches the settlement of Long Lake as it passes south of Raquette Lake. In the hamlet of Blue Mountain Lake, the route begins a wrong-way concurrency with NY30; the concurrency ends in the hamlet of Indian Lake. East of NY30, NY28 begins to shift towards the south.|$|E
5|$|Farther north, NY10 passes {{directly}} {{between the}} Stoner Lakes, {{a pair of}} small water bodies separated by only NY10, just south of where it crosses into <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County.</b> For most of its run through the county, NY10 parallels a waterbody, namely the west branch of the Sacandaga River to where the Piseco Outlet flows into it, then the Piseco Outlet north to Big Bay near the community of Higgins Bay. NY10 terminates soon after at an intersection with NY8 south of Piseco Lake, west of Spy Lake, and southwest of Higgins Bay.|$|E

5|$|Initially, NY30 was not {{the longest}} state highway in <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County.</b> When it was {{assigned}} in the 1930 renumbering, NY30 followed its current routing to Wells, where it terminated at NY8. The remainder of modern NY30 was part of NY8 from Wells to Speculator and part of NY10 from Speculator to the Canada–US border. Ca. 1960, NY10 was truncated south to Arietta, and NY30 was extended northward to the Canada–US border by way of NY8 and NY10's former routing.|$|E

5|$|After Harrison {{returned}} to the United States from Colombia, he settled on his farm in North Bend, Ohio, his adopted home state, living in relative retirement after nearly four decades of government service. Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County</b> Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from his mistake and stop the production of liquors.|$|E
5|$|In {{these early}} years, Harrison also earned {{money from his}} {{contributions}} to a biography written by James Hall, entitled A Memoir of the Public Services of William Henry Harrison, published in 1836. That year, he made an unsuccessful {{run for the presidency}} as a Whig candidate. Between 1836 and 1840, Harrison served as Clerk of Courts for <b>Hamilton</b> <b>County.</b> This was his job when he was elected president in 1840. About this time, Harrison met African-American abolitionist and Underground Railroad conductor George DeBaptiste who lived in nearby Madison. The two became friends, and DeBaptiste became his personal servant, staying with Harrison until his death. By 1840, when Harrison campaigned for president a second time, over a dozen books had been published on his life. He was hailed by many as a national hero.|$|E

5|$|McEwen {{won four}} of the five {{counties}} in the district — Adams, Brown, Clermont and Warren.

The race in the Second District, one of the most Republican in the country, was determined in the primary — six times as many Republicans as Democrats voted in the primary — and Portman easily defeated attorney Lee Hornberger 53,020 (70.1%) to 22,652 (29.1%) in the special election on May 4.|$|E
