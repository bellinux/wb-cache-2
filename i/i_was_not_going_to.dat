500|$|Vargas Llosa {{also built}} {{an image of}} the regime with the troubled {{historical}} events. With regard to the historical accuracy of the book, Vargas Llosa has said [...] "It's a novel, not a history book, so I took many, many liberties. The only limitation I imposed on myself was that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> invent anything that couldn't have happened within the framework of life in the Dominican Republic. I have respected the basic facts, but I have changed and deformed many things {{in order to make the}} story more persuasiveand I have not exaggerated." ...|$|E

500|$|Chandler's {{budget was}} limited, so {{in an effort}} to reduce {{expenditures}} he and Hendrix completed much of the album's pre-production work at their shared apartment. From the start, Chandler intentionally minimized the creative input of Mitchell and Redding. He later explained: [...] "I wasn't concerned that Mitch or Noel might feel that they weren't having enough—or any—say... I had been touring and recording in a band for years, and I'd seen everything end as a compromise. Nobody ended up doing what they really wanted to do. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> let that happen with Jimi." [...] When the Experience began studio rehearsals, Hendrix already had the chord sequences and tempos worked out for Mitchell, and Chandler would direct Redding's bass parts.|$|E
500|$|Esch {{returned}} for the Symbols album, which {{was released in}} 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy's Nivek Ogre. Symbols reached No.137 on the Billboard 200. Its first track, [...] "Megalomaniac", was featured in the film , {{and was the first}} song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. [...] Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on [...] "Anarchy". Looking back on Symbols in 2002, Konietzko said, [...] "I listened to the Symbols album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> do again." ...|$|E

Kamegai gave a good effort but fell short every time he would connect with a punch, Cotto would counter {{with a combination of}} his own. Cotto spent the early rounds backed against the ropes on the back foot and still managed to do some damage landing hooks to the head of Kamegai. After round 10, Cotto started boxing on the outside and decided to settle for a decision win, he explained in the post-fight, [...] "I think I did my best and I'm happy with my performance. (Kamegai) is a tough fighter. By the fifth or sixth round, I knew <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to stop him." [...] Cotto confirmed he would fight again in December, preferably the winner of Canelo-GGG.|$|E

2500|$|Although the {{suspects}} (except Salaam) had confessed on videotape {{in the presence}} of a parent or guardian, they retracted their statements within weeks, claiming that they had been intimidated, lied to, and coerced into making false confessions. The detectives had indeed used ruses to convince {{the suspects}} to confess, with Salaam confessing to having been present only after he was told that fingerprints were found on the victim's clothing. According to Salaam, [...] "I would hear them beating up Korey Wise in the next room", and [...] "they would come and look at me and say: 'You realise you're next.' The fear made me feel really like <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>going</b> <b>to</b> be able to make it out."
