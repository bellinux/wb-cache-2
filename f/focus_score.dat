40|$|OBJECTIVES: Sjögren's {{syndrome}} is a chronic inflammatory disease. The detection of chronic inflammatory infiltrates containing > 50 lymphocytes (lymphocytic focus) per 4 mm 2 tissue in minor salivary gland biopsies is a diagnostic parameter of the disease. The {{aim of the}} study was to examine if an increase in the tissue area of a single minor labial salivary gland biopsy through serial histological sections in patients affected by primary Sjögren's syndrome could facilitate the detection of the diagnostic <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (grades > 1 or > 2). METHODS: We observed 24 labial salivary gland biopsies from patients affected by primary Sjögren's syndrome, diagnosed according to the clinical-laboratory criteria proposed by the American-European Consensus Group. The analysis was carried out on sections (n= 72) obtained at three different levels at 200 micrometers from one another. The serial sections regarding the 3 levels were reviewed by the same oral pathologist, who detected both the total number of foci, and their surface, calculating a cumulative <b>focus</b> <b>score.</b> RESULTS: No significant correlation was found between the number of lobules per histological section and the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (Pearson correlation 0. 363, p= 0. 01). No significant variation in <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> distribution was identified in the three serial histological levels at 200 micrometers from one another. From the comparison between the number of lobules observed and the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> grade, no direct proportionality between the amount of parenchyma analyzed and the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> was found.

Among the 120 patients with pSS enrolled in the randomised TEARS trial of rituximab versus placebo, 35 underwent either centralised minor salivary-gland biopsy or SGUS at inclusion. The echostructure of each parotid and submandibular gland was graded on a scale of 0 to 4. Histologic minor salivary gland involvement was assessed by the <b>focus</b> <b>score.</b> Among rituximab-treated patients with available data (n = 14), half met the Sjögren's Syndrome Responder Index [SSRI]- 30 definition of a response at week 24. The SGUS score correlated positively to the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> [r = 0. 61] and negatively to the UWSF [r = - 0. 68]. The <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> was not correlated to the UWSF. The median total SGUS grade at inclusion was 9 [6 - 11] in responders versus 16 [11 - 16] in non-responders [p = 0. 04]. The proportion of SSRI- 30 responders was 0 % among patients with SGUS grade 4 and 88 % among those with SGUS grade ≤ 3. Low baseline SGUS scores were associated with sicca-related outcomes improvement, but not with fatigue or biological improvement.

40|$|OBJECTIVES—Prospectively {{collected}} computer database {{information was}} previously assessed on {{a cohort of}} 300  patients who fulfilled the Copenhagen classification criteria for primary Sjögren's syndrome. Analysis of the clinical data showed that patients who smoked had a decreased lower lip salivary gland <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (p   1). Furthermore the cohort was divided into three groups; 10 - 45, 46 - 60 and ⩾  61  years of age. Finally the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> {{was related to the}} smoking habits. Seroimmunological (ANA; anti-SSA/Ro antibodies; anti-SSB/La antibodies; IgM-RF and IgG) samples were analysed routinely.  RESULTS—The questionnaire was answered by 98 % (n= 355) of the cohort and the percentage of current smokers, former smokers and historical non-smokers at the time of lower lip biopsy was not statistically {{different from that of the}} control group. Cigarette smoking at the time of lower lip biopsy is associated with lower risk of abnormal <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (p   1) compared with having a non-focal sialadenitis or normal biopsy (<b>focus</b> <b>score</b> ⩽  1) was decreased in all three age groups (10 - 45 : odds ratio 0. 27,  95 %CI 0. 11  to 0. 71; 46 - 60 : odds ratio 0. 22,  95 %CI 0. 08  to 0. 59; and ⩾  61 : odds ratio 0. 36,  95 %CI 0. 10  to 1. 43) although there was only statistical significance in the two younger age groups. Moreover, among current smokers at the time of the lower lip biopsy there was a decreasing odds ratio for an abnormal lip <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> with increasing number of cigarettes smoked per week (p trend 0. 00). In the group of former smokers, which included patients that had stopped smoking up to 30  years ago, the results were in between those of the smokers and the historical non-smokers (odds ratio 0. 57,  95 %CI 0. 34  to 0. 97, compared with never smokers). Present or past smoking did not correlate with the function of the salivary glands as judged by unstimulated whole sialometry, stimulated whole sialometry or salivary gland scintigraphy. Among former smokers, the median time lapse between the first symptom of primary Sjögren's syndrome and the performance of the lower lip biopsy was approximately half as long as the median time lapse between smoking cessation and biopsy (8  versus 15  years). Hence, symptoms of Sjögren's syndrome are unlikely to have had a significant influence on smoking habits at the time of the biopsy. Among the seroimmunological results only anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La antibodies reached statistical significance in a manner similar to the way smoking influenced the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> in lower lip biopsies. On the other hand the level of significance was consistently more pronounced for the influence of smoking on the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> than for the influence on anti-SSA/Ro and anti-SSB/La autoantibodies.  CONCLUSION—This is believed to be the first report showing that cigarette smoking is negatively associated with focal sialadenitis—focus score > 1 —in lower lip biopsy in patients with primary Sjögren's syndrome. Furthermore, tobacco seems to decrease the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> in a dose dependent manner. Smoking may also negatively influence the presence of anti-SSA/Ro and/or anti-SSB/La antibodies in circulating blood. Thus, smoking habits of patients might invalidate the use of both lower lip salivary gland <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> and of anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies. It is suggested that the simultaneous performance of other objective tests is required to avoid misdiagnosis of oral involvement in smoking and former smoking patients. Therefore, classification criteria for Sjögren's syndrome that more or less rely on an abnormal <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> and/or presence of anti-SSA/anti-SSB antibodies should be used with great caution. ...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} capture an eye image {{of high quality}} in a gaze-tracking camera, an auto-focusing {{mechanism}} is used, which requires accurate focus assessment. Although there has been previous research on focus assessment in the spatial or wavelet domains, there are few previous studies that combine all of the methods of spatial and wavelet domains. Since all of the previous focus assessments in the spatial or wavelet domain methods have disadvantages, such as being affected by illumination variation, etc., we propose a new focus assessment method by combining the spatial and wavelet domain methods for the gaze-tracking camera. This research is novel in the following three ways, {{in comparison with the}} previous methods. First, the proposed focus assessment method combines the advantages of spatial and wavelet domain methods by using ε-support vector regression (SVR) with a symmetrical Gaussian radial basis function (RBF) kernel. In order to prevent the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> from being affected by a change in image brightness, both linear and nonlinear normalizations are adopted in the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> calculation. Second, based on the camera optics, we mathematically prove the reason for the increase in the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> in the case of daytime images or a brighter illuminator compared to nighttime images or a darker illuminator. Third, we propose a new criterion to compare the accuracies of the focus measurement methods. This criterion is based on the ratio of relative overlapping amount (standard deviation of <b>focus</b> <b>score)</b> between two adjacent positions along the Z-axis to the entire range of <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> variety between these two points.

40|$|Introduction. A simple {{microscopic}} diagnostic quantification {{system for}} neutrophile granulocytes (NG) was developed evaluating a single focal point (CD 15 <b>focus</b> <b>score)</b> which enables {{the detection of}} bacterial infection in SLIM (synoviallike interface membrane) Additionally a diagnostic algorithm is proposed {{how to use the}} CD 15 <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> and the quantification software (CD 15 Quantifier). Methods. 91 SLIM removed during revision surgery for histopathological diagnosis (hip; n= 59 and knee; n= 32) underwent histopathological classification according to the SLIM-consensus classification. NG where identified immunohistochemically by means of a CD 15 -specific monoclonal antibody exhibiting an intense granular cytoplasmic staining pattern. This pattern is different from CD 15 expression in macrophages showing a pale and homogenous expression in mononuclear cells. The quantitative evaluation of CD 15 -positive neutrophils granulocytes (CD 15 NG) used the principle of maximum focal infiltration (focus) together with an assessment of a single focal point (approximately 0. 3 mm 2). This immunohistochemical data made it possible to develop CD 15 Quantifier software which automatically quantifies CD 15 NG. Results. SLIM-cases with positive microbiological diagnosis (n= 47) have significantly (p< 0. 001, Mann-Whitney U test) more CD 15 NG/focal point than cases with negative microbiological diagnosis (n= 44). 50 CD 15 NG/focal point were identified as the optimum threshold when diagnosing infection of periprosthetic joints using the CD 15 <b>focus</b> <b>score.</b> If the microbiological findings are used as a ‘gold standard’ the diagnostic sensitivity is 0. 83, specificity is 0. 864. (PPV: 0. 87; NPV: 0. 83; accuracy 0. 846; AUC: 0. 878.) The evaluation findings for the preparations using the CD 15 Quantifier (n= 31) deviated in an average of 12 cells from the histopathological evaluation findings (CD 15 <b>focus</b> <b>score).</b> From a cell-count greater 62 CD 15 Quantifier needs on average 32 seconds less than the diagnostic pathologist. Conclusion. The CD 15 <b>focus</b> <b>score,</b> {{and the use of the}} «CD 15 Quantifier» software which is thereby made possible, offers an automated procedure which shortens the mentally tiring and time-consuming process of microscopic cell-counting.

40|$|Abstract: Phosphorylation of the H 2 AX {{protein is}} an early step in the double strand break (DSB) repair pathway; therefore, {{phosphorylated}} histone (γH 2 AX) <b>foci</b> <b>scoring</b> is widely used as a measure for DSBs. <b>Foci</b> <b>scoring</b> is performed either manually or semi-automatically using hand-operated capturing and image analysis software. In general, both techniques are laborious and prone to artifacts associated with manual scoring. While a few fully automated methods have been described in the literature, {{none of them have}} been used to quantify γH 2 AX foci in combination with a cell cycle phase analysis. Adding this feature to a rapid automated γH 2 AX foci quantification method would reduce the scoring uncertainty that arises from the variations in the background level of the γH 2 AX signal throughout the cell cycle. The method was set up to measure DNA damage induced in human mammary epithelial cells by irradiation under a mammogram device. We adapted a FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) Spot-counting system, which has a slide loader with automatic scanning and cell capture system throughout the thickness of each cell (z-stack), to meet our assay requirements.

The adult atrioventricular node is generally thought to be resistant to the damaging effects of anti-SSA/anti-SSB. However, case reports suggest that heart block developing in adult Sjogren's syndrome (SS) patients may be associated with these autoantibodies. Therefore, we investigated the relationship between serum antibodies and heart block in adult SS patients. Methods: We abstracted data from clinic patient records. Diagnosis of primary SS was based on American European classification criteria. Electrocardiograms (EKGs), laboratory immunology parameters, lipid profiles, and <b>focus</b> <b>scores</b> from labial salivary gland biopsies were available for 51 SS patients. Fifteen patients had follow-up EKGs. PR interval >= 200 ms was considered to be first-degree heart block. Results: Five patients showed prolonged PR intervals; the presence of heart block was not related to the presence of anti-SSA antibodies. However, significant differences between patients with prolonged and normal PR intervals were seen for mean <b>focus</b> <b>scores</b> (p < 0. 0001), anti-cardiolipin immunoglobulin IgG (p= 0. 0009), age (p= 0. 01), IgG (p= 0. 02), anti-SSB antibodies (p= 0. 02), and high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol levels (p= 0. 03).

40|$|Angiogenesis is {{a common}} finding in chronic {{inflammatory}} diseases; however, its role in Sjögren's syndrome (SS) remains to be elucidated. Previous SS studies have demonstrated an increase in VEGF-A/VEGFR- 2 system expression in minor salivary gland (MSG) biopsies from patients with SS, but differences in the new blood vessel formation between the different grades of disease severity have not been reported. Therefore, experiments were performed to demonstrate angiogenesis during different phases of primary SS (pSS) and to define {{the relationship between the}} microvessel density (MVD), macrophage infiltration and histiocyte distribution in SS MSG inflammatory lesions. In this series of experiments, immunohistochemistry was used to examine angiogenesis in serial sections of pSS MSG. Patients with pSS were classified accordingly with the grade of inflammatory lesions as I = low-grade (low <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> of 1 or 2), II = intermediate-grade (<b>focus</b> <b>score</b> of 3 – 6) and III = extensive inflammation in the MSG (high <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> of 12).

Methods:  Mice of different ages were used. Inflammatory infiltrates were quantified using the <b>focus</b> <b>score.</b> Acinar aquaporin- 5 subcellular distribution was determined by immunohistochemistry and quantified using labelling indices. Results:  Minor inflammatory infiltrates were present in r 1 f/r 2 n mice. Massive inflammatory infiltrates and acinar destruction were observed in 24 -week-old non-obese diabetic mice, 10 -and 13 -month-old IQI/JIC mice and some r 1 ΔT/r 2 n mice.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Sjögren's {{syndrome}} (SS), an autoimmune exocrinopathy mainly affecting lachrymal and salivary glands, {{results in}} ocular and oral dryness (keratoconjunctivitis sicca and xerostomia). The aetiology and pathogenesis are largely unknown; currently, only palliative treatment is available. OBJECTIVE: To determine whether gene transfer of vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), {{based on its}} immunomodulatory properties, might be useful {{in the management of}} SS. METHODS: A recombinant serotype 2 adeno-associated virus encoding the human VIP transgene (rAAV 2 hVIP) was constructed and its efficacy tested in the female non-obese diabetic (NOD) mouse model for SS after retrograde instillation in submandibular glands (SMGs). 10 (10) particles/gland of rAAV 2 hVIP or rAAV 2 LacZ (encoding beta-galactosidase; control vector) were administered at 8 weeks of age (before sialadenitis onset). Salivary flow rates were determined before vector delivery and at time of death (16 weeks). After death, saliva, serum, and SMGs were harvested. Salivary output, inflammatory infiltrates (<b>focus</b> <b>scores),</b> VIP protein expression, cytokine profile, and serum anti-VIP antibodies were analysed. RESULTS: rAAV 2 hVIP significantly improved the salivary flow, increased SMG and serum expression of VIP, and reduced SMG cytokines interleukin (IL) 2, IL 10, IL 12 (p 70), and tumour necrosis factor alpha, and serum RANTES, compared with the control vector. No difference in <b>focus</b> <b>scores</b> or apoptotic rates was found; neutralising antibodies were not detected. CONCLUSIONS: Local delivery of rAAV 2 hVIP can have disease modifying and immunosuppressive effects in SMGs of the NOD mouse model of SS.

40|$|Objective. Previous {{findings}} in labial salivary glands (LSGs) from patients with Sjogren ' s syndrome (SS) suggest that increased activity and expression of matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP- 9) and MMP- 3 trigger {{the destruction of}} acinar structures in these glands. Tissue inhibitors of matrix metalloproteinases (TIMPs) tightly control MMP activity, and TIMP expression is an important modulator of effects attributed to MMPs. This study was undertaken to investigate {{the correlation between the}} balance of MMPs/TIMPs in the LSGs of SS patients and the degree of inflammatory infiltration and acinar structure integrity. Methods. Three groups of SS patients classified according to <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> and residual tissue were studied. The expression of MMP- 2, MMP- 3, MMP- 9, TIMP- 1, and TIMP- 2 was examined at the messenger RNA and protein levels. The ratio of MMP/TIMP expression (R value) was calculated. <b>Focus</b> <b>score</b> and acinar structure were evaluated by histologic analysis. Results. In SS patients the MMP- 3 /TIMP- 1 ratio was higher than 1 and the MMP- 9 /TIMP- 1 ratio was much higher than I whereas the MMP- 2 /TIMP- 2 ratio nearly equaled 1, suggesting elevated proteolytic activity due mainly to NINIP- 9. R values were independent of the <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> of inflammatory cells, but correlated well with the dramatic changes observed in morphologic integrity of acini, as revealed mainly by the lack of nuclear polarity. Acinar changes were more evident when R values for both MMP- 9 /TIMP- 1 and MMP- 3 / TIMP- 1 were higher. Conclusion. This study provides evidence that an altered balance between MMPs and their inhibitors is associated with acinar damage. Since salivary gland acinar cells express both MMPs and TIMPs, these cells may {{play an important role in}} extracellular matrix destruction and in the LSG pathophysiology in SS...|$|E

We adapted a FISH (fluorescent in situ hybridization) Spot-counting system, which has a slide loader with automatic scanning and cell capture system throughout the thickness of each cell (z-stack), to meet our assay requirements. While scanning the sample, the system classifies the selected nuclei according to the signal patterns previously described by the user. For our purposes, a double staining immunofluorescence was carried out with antibodies to detect γH 2 AX and pericentrin, an integral component of the centrosome. We could thus distinguish both the number of γH 2 AX foci per cell and the cell cycle phase. Furthermore, restrictive settings of the program classifier reduced the “touching nuclei” problem described in other image analysis software. The automated scoring was faster than and as sensitive as its manually performed counterpart. This system is a reliable tool for γH 2 AX radio-induced foci counting and provides essential information about the cell cycle stage. It thus offers a more complete and rapid assessment of DNA damage...|$|R
40|$|Background: Primary Sjögren’s {{syndrome}} (pSS) is {{a complex}} autoimmune disease mostly affecting middle-aged women. The disease {{is characterized by a}} progressive dysfunction of the salivary glands associated to a variety of systemic manifestations. Recognizing pSS might be challenging as the available subjective and objective disease biomarkers are scarcely correlated with each other and an invasive technique such as the minor salivary gland biopsy (MSGB) is often mandatory for pSS diagnosis. In addition, in the absence of novel biomarkers, it remains an unresolved issue to reach a scientific consensus on universally accepted pSS classification criteria. Aims of the study: 1) to identify and validate putative salivary biomarkers in pSS by using LC-MS/MS. 2) to highlight a specific fingerprint able to discriminate between different pSS phenotypes, defined {{on the basis of the}} <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (FS) and on the variation of the salivary flow rate (USFR). Methods: USFR was collected from 18 patients with pSS (AECG criteria, 2002). Six patients presented a high <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (FS≥ 3) and normal ESFR (group A), six patients presented a FS≥ 3 and an USFR< 1. 5 ml/ 15 (Group B), and 6 patients a low <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (FS< 3) and USFR < 1. 5 ml/ 15 (group C). Six healthy volunteers (HV) represented the controls. High-abundance proteins were depleted using affinity and immunodepletion methodologies. A high-throughput liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) was used for the proteomic analysis. ELISA and WB were utilized to validate preoteomics results. Results: Overall 100 differentially expressed candidate biomarkers were identified. PCA distinctively discriminate between HV and pSS patients stratified as previously described. Among the differentially expressed proteins, of interest were: cystatins, proline-rich proteins, S- 100 proteins, profilin and other cell motion-related proteins, proteins involved in apoptosis, defence- and inflammatory-response. Moreover, each pSS phenotype seemed characterized by a specific proteomics fingerprint. Conclusions: The proteomics workflow was able to detect novel factors potentially related to specific phenotypes of pSS disease. These candidate biomarkers might be useful to improve pSS non-invasive diagnosis and clinical stratification...|$|E
40|$|With {{the aim of}} morphologically characterizing chronic sialoadenitis in {{patients}} with hepatitis C virus (HCV) chronic liver disease, labial salivary gland biopsies from 22 chronic HCV liver disease and from 10 primary Sjogren's syndrome patients were compared. Only <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> (number of aggregates with more than 50 lymphocytes per 4 mm(2) of glandular tissue) and grading of inflammation were able to discriminate significantly between the two patient groups. Duct ectasia, acinar depletion, presence of lymphoid aggregates with less than 50 lymphocytes and of lymphoid infiltration within intralobular salivary duct epithelium were evident in both disease groups {{and appeared to be}} non-specific, mostly age-related changes. In both patient groups plasma cell and lymphocyte typing showed similar features: T lymphocytes represented most of the lymphoid population, B lymphocytes were few unless follicles were present. Higher <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> values were associated with a plasma cell switch from an IgA to an IgM and/or IgG predominance. A greater morphological similarity was seen between biopsies of the primary Sjogren's syndrome group and those of female rather than male chronic HCV liver disease patients. Salivary gland tissue in HCV patients responds to damage in a fashion similar to primary Sjogren's syndrome, the only difference being a lesser degree of inflammation...|$|E
40|$|Major {{salivary gland}} (SG) {{ultrasonography}} (US) represents a noninvasive, nonirradiating imaging modality {{for evaluation of}} the major SGs in the diagnosis and follow-up of primary and secondary Sjögren syndrome. Structural changes can be visualized as hyperechogenic and hypoechogenic areas, inhomogeneity, and altered echogenicity in general. The reliability of SG-US is poorly investigated, and the definition of US abnormalities varies in previously published studies. Recent studies have shown correlations between SG-US findings and <b>focus</b> <b>score</b> in the minor SGs; however further {{studies are needed to}} validate a US criterion in updated classification/diagnostic criteria...|$|E
40|$|Extracellular high {{mobility}} group box 1 (HMGB 1) {{acts as a}} damage associated molecular pattern molecule {{through the}} Toll-like receptor to promote autoreactive B cell activation, which {{may be involved in}} the pathogenesis of Sjӧgren's syndrome. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the effect of subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB 1 on dry eye in a mouse model of Sjӧgren's syndrome. Ten weeks-old NOD. B 10. H 2 b mice were subconjunctivally injected with 0. 02 to 2 μg of anti-HMGB 1 antibodies or PBS twice a week for two consecutive weeks. Tear volume and corneal staining scores were measured and compared between before- and after-treatment. Goblet cell density was counted in PAS stained forniceal conjunctiva and inflammatory <b>foci</b> <b>score</b> (> 50 cells/focus) was measured in extraorbital glands. Flow cytometry was performed to evaluate the changes in BrdU+ cells, IL- 17 -, IL- 10 -, or IFNγ-secreting cells, functional B cells, and IL- 22 secreting innate lymphoid cells (ILC 3 s) in cervical lymph nodes. The level of IL- 22 in intraorbital glands was measured by ELISA. Injection of 2 μg or 0. 02 μg anti-HMGB 1 attenuated corneal epithelial erosions and increased tear secretion (p< 0. 05). Goblet cell density was increased in 0. 2 μg and 2 μg anti-HMGB 1 -treated-mice with marginal significance. The inflammatory <b>foci</b> <b>score,</b> and the number of BrdU+ cells, IL- 17 -, IL- 10 -, IFNγ-secreting cells, and functional B cells did not significantly change following anti-HMGB 1 treatment. Surprisingly, the percentage of ILC 3 s was significantly increased in the draining lymph nodes (p< 0. 05), and the expression of IL- 22 was significantly increased in the intraorbital glands (p< 0. 05) after administration of 2 μg anti-HMGB 1. This study shows that subconjunctival administration of anti-HMGB 1 attenuates clinical manifestations of dry eye. The improvement of dry eye may involve an increase of ILC 3 s, rather than modulation of B or plasma cells, as shown using a mouse model of Sjӧgren's syndrome...|$|R
