5|$|James VI's {{visit to}} Denmark in 1589, where witch-hunts were already common, may have {{encouraged}} {{an interest in}} the study of witchcraft, and he came to see the storms he encountered on his voyage as the result of magic. After his return to Scotland, he attended the North Berwick witch trials, the first major persecution of witches in Scotland under the 1563 Act and the first known to successfully involve the diabolic pact. Several people, most notably Agnes Sampson and the schoolmaster John Fian, were convicted of using witchcraft to send storms against James' ship. James became obsessed with the threat posed by witches. He subsequently believed that a nobleman, Francis Stewart, 5th Earl of Bothwell, was a witch, and after the latter fled in fear of his life, he was outlawed as a traitor. The king subsequently set up royal commissions to hunt down witches in his realm, recommending torture in dealing with suspects. James is known to have personally supervised the torture of women accused of being witches. Inspired by his personal involvement, in 1597 he wrote the Daemonologie, a tract that opposed the practice of witchcraft and which provided background material for Shakespeare's Tragedy of Macbeth, which contains probably the most famous literary depiction of Scottish witches. James imported continental explanations of witchcraft. His goal was to divert suspicion away from male homosociality among the elite, and focus <b>fear</b> <b>on</b> female communities and large gatherings of women. He thought they threatened his political power so he laid the foundation for witchcraft and occultism policies, especially in Scotland. The point was that a widespread belief in the conspiracy of witches and a witches' Sabbath with the devil deprived women of political influence. Occult power was supposedly a womanly trait because women were weaker and more susceptible to the devil. However, after the publication of Daemonologie his views became more sceptical, and in the same year he revoked the standing commissions on witchcraft, limiting prosecutions by the central courts.|$|E

500|$|Clock Tower {{was first}} {{released}} on the Super Famicom on September 14, 1995. According to Kono, the game sold [...] "fairly well."

500|$|The {{first game}} in the series, Clock Tower (1995), was {{developed}} by Human Entertainment with direction led by Hifumi Kono.

The game borrows many ideas from his 1980s films, perhaps most notably Phenomena (1985). Clock Tower was an experimental project for Human Entertainment and was developed with a small budget and staff. It was first released on the Super Famicom on 14 September 1995 exclusively in Japan. The game sold well and was later re-released with some gameplay and graphical changes under the title Clock Tower: The First <b>Fear</b> <b>on</b> PlayStation, Windows, and WonderSwan.

In the continuation they also deviate only on one word, [...] "" [...] (lamented) in the alto, [...] "" [...] (hoped) in the tenor. The flowing 12/8 time signature of the duet and a virtuoso solo violin are reminiscent of the original purpose of the music in the congratulatory cantata.
