50|$|The {{original}} Triton introduced many improvements {{over the}} Trinity, like 62-note polyphony, arpeggiator, onboard sampler, faster operating system and more realtime controllers. However, to much surprise of musicians and journalists, it lost the sequencer audio tracks, digital input and output, and the digital filter section was downgraded, thus limiting sample-based synthesis. The original piano samples, a crucial evaluation element of expensive synths and music workstations, were {{the subject of}} even greater criticism; arguably, the integrated sample RAM could compensate for this. With successive models, some of these shortcomings were rectified, such as the digital connectivity, and improvement of the piano samples. The sample-based synthesis filter section, however, was never improved. Some limited 2-track audio recording was added to later revisions of the Triton Studio, while the Triton Extreme added <b>in-track</b> sampling support, allowing stereo samples to be recorded in context with a MIDI sequence and automatic triggering of the samples at their proper locations in the sequence during playback. Whilst less robust in function and practice, <b>in-track</b> sampling did mitigate {{for the lack of}} full audio recording in the Triton Extreme.|$|E

5000|$|Record Breakers were Mini 4WD {{but not in}} the {{conventional}} sense as they didn't have the pins or blades characteristic of most. They were battery operated and could run on a track with horizontal side-mounted guide wheels, but could just as well run independently of tracks, though if their guide wheels were removed, <b>in-track</b> performance would be greatly diminished if not impossible. The cars were known for their high performance, and on smooth surfaces were capable of 20 mph, translating into 500 to 640 scale miles per hour. [...] A car outside of a track would inevitably crash into an obstacle if not otherwise stopped. Twin electric motors cars ran off two AA batteries. Another version of the cars used a single motor that ran on two AA batteries, though often a third battery could be added for additional power. The single motor cars could be manually switched between 2WD and 4WD.

40|$|The {{ability to}} {{automatically}} generate large-area land-use/land-cover (LU/LC) classification maps from very-high spatial resolution (VHR) satellite data {{is dependent on}} two capabilities: (1) {{the ability to create}} a data model able to accurately classify satellite data into the appropriate surface types and (2) the ability to apply this model to the multiple images necessary to create a large-area VHR mosaic. This research describes methods for improving these capabilities by leveraging the unique characteristics of VHR <b>in-track</b> and composite multi-angle data. It is shown that new features can be extracted from both <b>in-track</b> and composite multi-angle data in order to improve classification performance. These features encode information extracted from the spatial and spectral variations of the multi-angle data, such as spectral fluctuation with view-angle and pixel height. This additional knowledge provides the capability to both improve image classification performance (29 % in the demonstrated experiments) and include urban LU/LC classes, such as bridges, high-volume highways, and parking lots, that are normally difficult to identify in multispectral urban data. Additionally, methods that apply a multispectral classification model across multiple images (model portability) are also explored using the simplifying test cases of <b>in-track</b> and composite multi-angle data. The <b>in-track</b> results show that the portability of a multispectral model can be improved from no portability (losing all classification capability when applying the model across the multi-angle images) to a 10 % reduction in kappa coefficient across the sequence of <b>in-track</b> images when physically based image normalization techniques are appropriately applied. The additional noise of seasonality limits the portability performance in the composite multi-angle sequence to an approximate reduction in kappa coefficient of 20 % in the best cases...|$|E
40|$|Three {{satellites}} of the AeroCube- 4 series {{built by}} The Aerospace Corporation were launched in September 2012 from Vandenberg Air Force Base. These satellites were each {{equipped with an}} on-board GPS receiver that provided position measurements with a precision of 20 meters and enabled the generation of ephemerides with meter-level accuracy. Each AeroCube was also equipped with two extendable wings that altered the satellite’s cross-sectional area {{by a factor of}} three. In conjunction with the GPS measurements, high-precision orbit determination detected deliberate changes in the AeroCube’s drag profile via wing manipulation. The AeroCube operations team succeeded in using this variable drag to re-order the satellites’ <b>in-track</b> configuration. A differential cross-section was created by closing the wings of one satellite while the others’ remained open, and the relative <b>in-track</b> motion between two AeroCubes was reversed.

A preliminary effort in applying a genetic algorithm (GA) to those kinds of problems has also been demonstrated through a simulation study with a simple case problem and various fitness functions. And then, GA is applied to the complex case problem including multi-threatening objects. Two distinct collision avoidance maneuvers are dealt with: the first is <b>in-track</b> direction of collision avoidance maneuver. The second considers radial, <b>in-track,</b> cross-track direction maneuver. The results show that the first case violates the collision probability threshold, while the second case does not violate the threshold with satisfaction of all conditions. Various factors for analyzing and planning the optimal collision avoidance maneuver are also presented...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{spacecraft}} rendezvous and spacecraft {{formation flying}} {{were examined in}} context of the TECSAS mission.

Results showed that the lidar-based V-bar approach trajectory with a 90 m straight-line approach distance is the optimal scenario for the given TECSAS mission guidelines. Four formation flying scenarios are examined: two projected circular formations and two <b>in-track</b> formations. The effects of the J 2 and atmospheric drag perturbations on these formations are studied for several time spans. Results showed that the projected circular formations are disrupted by the J 2 perturbations after a short time span, and that atmospheric drag perturbations caused significant <b>in-track</b> and radial drifts for formations where the two spacecraft are not identical. Finally, control force requirements are much higher for both formations when the two spacecraft are not identical...|$|E

Results show the technology maintaining <b>in-track</b> position to ± 1 km indefinitely while using less propellant than traditional orbit maintenance. Implementing autonomous orbit control significantly reduces operations costs, eliminates {{many of the}} traditional payload planning cycles, and creates added system robustness. In addition, this technology provides a capability never previously available: specifying a satellite’s position months, if not years, in advance with great ease and accuracy with simple geometric calculations rather than complex orbital mechanics and propagation.

40|$|We {{investigated}} the accuracy in three dimensional geo-positioning derived by two homo-type stereo pairs and four hetero-type stereo pairs of high resolution satellite images using the vendor-provided rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) in this research. The results of 3 D geo-positioning from six different stereo combinations were assessed with seventeen GPS points which were commonly well {{distributed in the}} scenes. Recently, satellite image vendors provide homo-type stereo pair images taken by the same sensor during a short time period. Stereo pair images have good geometry for achieving accurate ground coordinates. However {{it is difficult to}} acquire them at the request time because of the revisit time of the satellite and current weather conditions. Due to these reasons, a new methodology using hetero-type stereo pairs has been suggested to derive ground coordinates. High resolution satellite images include the rational function model in the form of RPC which represents the relationship between the image coordinates and object coordinates with rational polynomials. RPC makes it fast, accurate, and simple to calculate ground coordinates without any exterior orientation parameters of satellites. We constituted six different stereo pairs from four images of GeoEye- 1 <b>in-track</b> stereo pair images and WorldView- 2 <b>in-track</b> stereo pair images which were collected for the same region (17. 5 km x 10. 0 km) of the west coast in Korea. We collected GCPs by differential GPS surveying. The ground coordinates derived from six different pairs without and with some GCPs were compared to all GPS points respectively. The accuracy of ground coordinates from hetero-type stereo pairs is equivalent to the accuracy from homo-type stereo pairs. This research demonstrates that we can achieve comparatively accurate ground coordinates without GCPs using any stereo combinations of images containing proper RPCs, although we don't have <b>in-track</b> stereo pair images. Furthermore, some proper combinations of images with GCPs can improve the positioning accuracy...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, a {{nonlinear}} trajectory {{control algorithm}} of rendezvous with maneuvering target spacecraft is presented. The disturbance {{forces on the}} chaser and target spacecraft and the thrust forces on the chaser spacecraft are considered in the analysis. The control algorithm developed in this paper uses the relative distance and relative velocity between the target and chaser spacecraft as the inputs. A general formula of reference relative trajectory of the chaser spacecraft to the target spacecraft is developed and applied to four different proximity maneuvers, which are <b>in-track</b> circling, cross-track circling, <b>in-track</b> spiral rendezvous and cross-track spiral rendezvous. The closed-loop differential equations of the proximity relative motion with the control algorithm are derived. It is proven {{in the paper that}} the tracking errors between the commanded relative trajectory and the actual relative trajectory are bounded within a constant region determined by the control gains. The prediction of the tracking errors is obtained. Design examples are provided to show the implementation of the control algorithm. The simulation results show that the actual relative trajectory tracks the commanded relative trajectory tightly. The predicted tracking errors match those calculated in the simulation results.

40|$|During {{the past}} twenty-five years {{the use of}} Hot Mix Asphalt (HMA) as a subballast layer, or underlayment, within the track {{structure}} has steadily increased until it is becoming standard practice {{in many areas of}} the United States. This asphalt-bound impermeable layer, typically 5 to 8 in. (125 to 200 mm) thick, provides a “hardpan ” to protect the underlying roadbed and to support the overlying ballast and track. Long-term performance studies on numerous HMA installations attest to the improved attributes and economic benefits of the asphalt layer, particularly on heavy tonnage lines traversing areas of marginal geotechnical engineering characteristics. Recent studies involve instrumenting HMA trackbeds with earth pressure cells and displacement transducers to measure pressure levels and distributions within the track structure and rail deflections under moving trains. These tests, conducted in real time domain train operations, confirm the positive attributes of the asphalt layer. Results are presented in detail for test installations on a CSX Transportation heavy tonnage mainline and at the Transportation Technology Center (Pueblo) low track modulus heavy tonnage test track. KENTRACK, a finite element, layer-elastic trackbed structural design computer program, is utilized for determining the effects of varying trackbed materials, component thicknesses, and designs on pressure distributions in the track structure.

40|$|Prestressed {{concrete}} sleepers (or railroad ties) are {{structural members}} that distribute the wheel loads from the rails {{to the track}} support system. Over a period of time, the concrete sleepers age and deteriorate in addition to experiencing various types of static and dynamic loading conditions, which are attributable to train operations. Recent studies have established two main limit states for the design consideration of concrete sleepers: ultimate limit states under extreme impact and fatigue limit states under repeated probabilistic impact loads. It was noted that the prestress level has {{a significant role in}} maintaining the high endurance of the sleepers under low to moderate repeated impact loads. This experimental investigation was aimed at static and dynamic load rating of aged railway concrete sleepers after service. Fifteen sleepers were extracted from a heavy haul rail network for testing using experimental facilities at the University of Wollongong (UoW), Australia. The structural evaluation program included quasi-static bending tests, dynamic impact tests, and tests to establish the current level of prestress in the steel wires using the dynamic relaxation technique. Two of the sleepers were evaluated for the level of prestressing forces in accordance with Australian Standards. Through diagnostic tests, the results of quasi-static bending tests produced the <b>in-track</b> bending capacities of sleepers that can be combined with the moments and forces anticipated {{over the next ten years}} to predict performance of the sleepers on a heavy haul coal line. The dynamic tests simulating the ability of concrete sleepers to resist extreme loading events due to heavy impact loads demonstrated that the sleepers <b>in-track</b> are likely to be able to resist the planned increased traffic without catastrophic failure over the next decade. Final conclusions suggest that there should be a routine test program every five years to ascertain the load rating of clustered sleepers and their fastening system in the heavy haul track system...|$|E
