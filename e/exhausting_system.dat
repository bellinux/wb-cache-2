40|$|Program bloat is a {{fundamental}} problem {{in the field of}} Genetic Programming (GP). Exponential growth of redundant and functionally useless sections of programs can quickly overcome a GP system, <b>exhausting</b> <b>system</b> resources and causing premature termination of the system before an acceptable solution can be found. Simplification is an attempt to remove such redundancies from programs. This paper looks at the effects of applying an algebraic simplification algorithm to programs during the GP evolution. The GP system with the simplification is examined and compared to a standard GP system on four regression and classification problems of varying difficulty. The results suggest that the GP system employing a simplification component can achieve superior efficiency and effectiveness to the standard system on these problems...|$|E

40|$|Recent {{progress}} in multiple and automated-sequencing technology allows large-scale random cDNA sequencing, the so-called EST project, in various fields. In {{addition to the}} EST collection, the cDNA project requires analysis of spatiotemporal patterns of gene expression {{of a large number}} of clones by whole-mount in situ hybridization (WISH). To facilitate the multiple WISH procedures, we developed a protocol for rapid and uniform synthesis of multiple probes and multi-well based WISH processing. A DIG-labeled RNA probe for WISH was synthesized from a PCR-amplified template which contained an RNA promoter. All reactions of PCR and subsequent RNA synthesis were performed in a single tube by sequential addition of the reagents without phenol extraction or ethanol precipitation steps. An RNA probe was purified and condensed by a centrifugal ultrafilter to achieve high and stable purification efficiency. WISH of 96 samples were performed simultaneously in a 96 -well plate attached to silent screen filters that were connected with a vacuum <b>exhausting</b> <b>system.</b> These processes eliminated the labor-intensive steps of WISH and provided opportunities to search for novel genes...|$|E

During this, the existing <b>exhausting</b> <b>system</b> of the melting pot can only drawing off partly the dusts and flue gases. The vertically adjustable nozzle plate, directly mounted above the furnace, gathers the flaring dusts and adjusts to all operating conditions without hindering the personnel. The gathering of dust by means of tube and flange was described by Prof. D. K. Schmidt in the book titled 'Dust suppression in the foundry industry'. After this, a nozzle plate was developed at WH and used for trials. Casset tube filters {{according to the latest}} technical standard were mounted. The measure carried out represents an essential improvement of the jobs and the situation regarding the immission in the neighbourhood. Due to the telescope guiding of the nozzle plate, it is guaranteed, that the furnace can be dumped. (orig.)

40|$|We {{present a}} {{quantitative}} overhead analysis for effective task migration in biosensor networks. A biosensor network {{is the key}} technology which can automatically provide accurate and specific parameters of a human in real time. Biosensor nodes are typically very small devices, so the use of computing resources is restricted. Due to the limitation of nodes, the biosensor network is vulnerable to an external attack against a system for <b>exhausting</b> <b>system</b> availability. Since biosensor nodes generally deal with sensitive and privacy data, their malfunction can bring unexpected damage to system. Therefore, {{we have to use}} a task migration process to avoid the malfunction of particular biosensor nodes. Also, it is essential to accurately analyze overhead to apply a proper migration process. In this paper, we calculated task processing time of nodes to analyze system overhead and compared the task processing time applied to a migration process and a general method. We focused on a cluster ratio and different processing time between biosensor nodes in our simulation environment. The results of performance evaluation show that task execution time is greatly influenced by a cluster ratio and different processing time of biosensor nodes.

40|$|Current {{levels of}} {{consumption}} {{have pushed the}} global eco-system towards the brink that is irreversible damage, threatening various interconnected natural domains. Companies have replaced their humanity for assembly-line workers with dismally low wages and stressful working conditions to pursue profits. For these reasons {{it is imperative to}} establish a new concept for economies to revolve around sustainability, via 'Radical Transparency ' in production chains. Numerous eco-labels and standards do exist but they offer fragmented coverage and sometimes even confuse both businesses and consumers. Therefore a common language and an overall system is required to inform all parties, allowing economies to achieve their sustainability goals. The proposed solution is built across two main categories, "People " and "Earth " and involves various criteria across socio-environmental domains. The common language is translated into a Standard built upon four pillars:- Pure (health and safety, authenticity, transparency),- Fair (workers rights, education and personal development, fair trading practices),- Life (biodiversity, animal welfare, natural resources conservation),- Renew (energy and GHG reduction, waste reduction, clean air, water and soil).

40|$|One type {{of attack}} on {{computer}} systems is {{know as a}} Denial of Service (DoS) attack. A DoS attack is designed to prevent legitimate users from using a system. Traditional Denial of Service attacks are done by exploiting a buffer overflow, <b>exhausting</b> <b>system</b> resources, or exploiting a system bug that results {{in a system that}} is no longer functional. In the summer of 1999, a new breed of attack has been developed called Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack. Several educational and high capacity commercial sites have been affected by these DDoS attacks. A DDoS attack uses multiple machines operating in concert to attack a network or site. There is very little that can be done if you are the target of a DDoS. The nature of these attacks cause so much extra network traffic that it is difficult for legitimate traffic to reach your site while blocking the forged attacking packets. The intent {{of this paper is to}} help sites not be involved in a DDoS attack. The first tools developed to perpetrate the DDoS attack were Trin 00 and Tribe Flood Network (TFN). They spawned the next generation of tools called Tribe Flood Network 2000 (TFN 2 K) and Stacheldraht (German for Barb Wire). These DDoS attack tools are designed to bring one or more sites down by flooding the victim with large amounts of network traffic originating at multiple locations and remotely controlled by a single client. This paper discusses how these DDoS tools work, how to detect them, and specific technical information on each individual tool. It is written with the system administrator in mind.
