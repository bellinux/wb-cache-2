5|$|In December 1891, May {{was engaged}} to her second cousin once removed, Prince Albert Victor, Duke of Clarence and Avondale, the eldest son of the Prince of Wales. The choice of May as bride for the Duke owed much to Queen Victoria's fondness for her, {{as well as to}} <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> {{character}} and sense of duty. However, Albert Victor died six weeks later, in a recurrence of the worldwide 1889–90 influenza pandemic.|$|E

5|$|The {{precursor}} disturbance brought {{light to}} moderate rainfall to El Salvador. Many homes were damaged, roads were flooded, and several trees were downed. A 44-year-old woman died when a tree fell on <b>her.</b> <b>Strong</b> winds and high waves damaged four homes in Barrio Playa, in the municipality of Acajutla. As a result, shelters were opened, though only seven people sought refuge in them. This same disturbance brought landslides to Guatemala; consequently, 30 people moved to shelters.|$|E
5|$|Anne {{became a}} general {{favourite}} {{with the people}} she met either at The Hague or at the Princess of Orange's country house at Teylingen. She was very attractive and stylish, and attracted many men. One of the first men {{to fall in love}} with Anne was Spencer Compton, a son of the Earl of Northampton. However, Anne quickly fell in love with Henry Jermyn, who returned her feelings. Anne dismissed Jermyn just as quickly when she met James, Duke of York, the son of the deposed king. On 24 November 1659, two or three years after she first met him, James promised he would marry Anne. Charles, James' brother, forced him reluctantly into this, saying that <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> character would be a positive influence on his weak-willed brother.|$|E
5|$|During {{her first}} {{appearances}} as {{a figment of}} Newt's imagination, Rae was depicted as a goth with an emo persona. When she was reintroduced as a real person, Rae's character was more reminiscent {{to that of a}} chav. The character later underwent a transitional period; she retained <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> personality, but displayed a weaker side resulting from the setbacks she encountered. Barlow found the role challenging, as her own personality is dissimilar from her character's. She described Rae as someone who always makes her opinion known, and hoped she would be remembered for her strong-willed persona.|$|E

5|$|During {{this same}} time, Dunderdale {{was named the}} best fiscal {{performer}} of Canada's premiers by the Fraser Institute. The institute measured the performance of all premiers for their time in office, which was the 2011-2012 fiscal year for Dunderdale, and looked at their performance on three core components of fiscal policy: government spending, taxes, and debt and deficits. Dunderdale received a score of 71.4 {{out of a possible}} 100.0, though the report did mention that <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> performance with regards to government spending was in part due to the province’s significant economic growth and not her ability to restrain growth in spending.|$|E
5|$|HMS Medway was {{the first}} {{purpose-built}} submarine depot ship constructed for the Royal Navy. She was built by Vickers Armstrong at Barrow-in-Furness during the late 1920s. The ship served on the China Station before the Second World War and was transferred to Egypt in early 1940. Ordered to evacuate Alexandria {{in the face of}} the German advance after the Battle of Gazala in May 1942, Medway sailed for Lebanon at the end of June, escorted by a light cruiser and seven destroyers. <b>Her</b> <b>strong</b> escort could not protect her; on 30 June a German submarine torpedoed and sank her.|$|E
5|$|In 2005, Strickland {{garnered}} positive critical {{comment for}} the romantic comedy Fever Pitch, and in 2007, {{she was a}} cast regular in the television show The Wedding Bells and subsequently {{was added to the}} cast of Private Practice. Strickland has spoken against the emphasis placed on beauty in the Los Angeles acting community, in which she says her Southern U.S. background has helped to distinguish herself from other blonde-haired actors. She has spoken of an affinity for <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> female characters and a desire to avoid sexualizing or sensationalizing her self-presentation as a woman. She also has worked closely with the Rape, Abuse, and Incest National Network (RAINN) after participating in a storyline in which her Private Practice character Charlotte King was raped.|$|E

5|$|In {{the third}} decade of her reign, {{influenced}} by her Jewish courtier Abraham Mendel Theben, Maria Theresa issued edicts which offered some state protection to her Jewish subjects. Her actions {{during the late}} stages of her reign contrast her early opinions. She forbade the forcible conversion of Jewish children to Christianity in 1762, and in 1763 she forbade Catholic clergy from extracting surplice fees from her Jewish subjects. In 1764, she ordered the release of those Jews who had been jailed for a blood libel {{in the village of}} Orkuta. Notwithstanding <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> dislike of Jews, Maria Theresa supported Jewish commercial and industrial activity in Austria.|$|E
5|$|Margot Kidder as Lois Lane: A {{reporter}} at the Daily Planet, who becomes a romantic interest to Clark Kent. The producers and director had a very specific concept for Lois: liberated, hard-nosed, witty and attractive. Kidder was cast because her performance had a certain spark and vitality, and because of <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> interaction with Christopher Reeve. Over 100 actresses were considered for the role. Margot Kidder (suggested by Stalmaster), Anne Archer, Susan Blakely, Lesley Ann Warren, Deborah Raffin and Stockard Channing screen tested from March through May 1977. The final decision was between Channing and Kidder, with the latter winning the role.|$|E
5|$|Melanie {{was created}} by {{producer}} Mara Brock Akil. While casting the character, Brock Akil had doubts about whether Mowry {{would be the best}} choice, given her wholesome image from starring as Tia Landry on the sitcom Sister, Sister, but hired the actress based on <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> work ethic and her desire {{to be part of the}} series. Mowry considered the character to be her first adult role and felt it emphasized her individuality and maturity. She identified closely with the part, observing parallels between Melanie's relationship with Derwin and her own marriage to actor Cory Hardrict. She cited The Game as an example of women receiving more lead roles on television.|$|E

5|$|O'Hara {{made her}} first film with Wayne, the actor {{with whom she}} is most closely associated, with Rio Grande (1950). This was {{followed}} by The Quiet Man (1952), her best-known film, and The Wings of Eagles (1957), by which time her relationship with Ford had deteriorated. Such was <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> chemistry with Wayne that many assumed they were married or in a relationship. In the 1960s O'Hara increasingly turned to more motherly roles as she aged, appearing in films such as The Deadly Companions (1961), The Parent Trap (1961) and The Rare Breed (1966). She retired from the industry in 1971 after starring with Wayne one final time in Big Jake, but returned 20 years later to appear with John Candy in Only the Lonely (1991).|$|E
5|$|During her {{exploration}} of the grounds, Adrienne finds a secret chapel hidden behind a bricked off fireplace. After opening a locked box atop an altar, Adrienne unknowingly releases Carno's demon, which promptly possesses Don. Don starts acting menacingly and aggressively toward Adrienne and becomes progressively worse as time passes, culminating in a controversial scene in which he rapes Adrienne. Eventually, Adrienne meets Harriet Hockaday (V. Joy Lee), a superstitious vagrant, and <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> but dim-witted son, Cyrus (Steven W. Bailey), who are secretly living in a barn on the estate. After Adrienne agrees to let them stay, they volunteer to help around the mansion. When a technician named Mike (Carl Neimic) visits the mansion to install the phone, Don screams at him in a jealous rage, warning him {{to stay away from}} his wife, much to Adrienne's horror. Later, unbeknownst to Adrienne, Don bludgeons Mike to death.|$|E
5|$|Mulan is {{praised by}} the Emperor {{and the people}} of China, who all bow to her, an {{unprecedented}} honor. Mulan accepts the Emperor's crest and Shan Yu's sword as gifts but politely declines his offer to be his advisor and instead asks to return to her family. She returns home and presents the imperial gifts to her father, but he is more overjoyed to have his daughter back safely. Li Shang, who has become enamored with Mulan, soon arrives under the guise of returning her helmet but accepts the family's invitation for dinner. Earlier in the film, Mulan was declared unfit for marriage, but this now appears not to be the case with <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> budding romance with Li Shang. Mushu is granted a position as a Fa family guardian by the ancestors amid a returning celebration.|$|E

5|$|The creators' {{first choice}} {{for the role of}} Monica was comedian Janeane Garofalo. Cox had {{originally}} been offered the role of Rachel but declined in favor of playing the character's best friend Monica because she was drawn to <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> personality. Meanwhile, the role of Rachel went to actress Jennifer Aniston, Cox's co-star to whom the role of Monica had originally been offered. Before Friends aired, Monica's characterization was greatly debated among writers in regards to the character sleeping with a man on their first date during the pilot. Kauffman in particular greatly defended Monica, arguing with NBC executive Don Ohlmeyer over whether or not this would make the character too promiscuous. Ultimately, the episode aired unchanged after the studio surveyed the audience, the results of which returned in favor of Monica's existing storyline. The character's struggles with childhood obesity, challenges with romantic relationships and complicated relationship with her mother would eventually become popular staples of the show.|$|E
5|$|Rand wrote Night of January 16th in 1933. She was 28 and {{had been}} in the United States for seven years after emigrating from the Soviet Union, where <b>her</b> <b>strong</b> anti-Communist {{opinions}} had put her at risk. Rand had never written a stage play, but had worked in Hollywood as a junior screenwriter for Cecil B. DeMille, and later in RKO Studios' wardrobe department. In September 1932, Rand sold an original screenplay, Red Pawn, to Universal Studios and quit RKO to finish her first novel, We the Living. She wrote the stage play with the hope of making money from it while finishing her novel. By 1934 her agent was trying to sell the play and the novel, but both were repeatedly rejected. Red Pawn was shelved and Rand's contract for rewrites on it expired. Rand's husband, actor Frank O'Connor, was getting only minor roles with little pay, leaving the couple in financial difficulties. With the last of her money from Red Pawn exhausted, Rand got an offer for her new play from Al Woods, who had produced The Trial of Mary Dugan for Broadway. The contract included a condition that Woods could make changes to the script. Wary that he would destroy her vision of the play to create a more conventional drama, Rand turned Woods down.|$|E
