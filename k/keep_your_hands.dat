500|$|When {{the prime}} {{minister}} asked Manekshaw to go to Dhaka and accept the surrender of Pakistani forces, he declined, saying that the honour {{should go to the}} Indian Army Commander in the East, Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Concerned about maintaining discipline {{in the aftermath of the}} conflict, Manekshaw issued strict instructions forbidding looting and rape. He stressed the need to respect and stay away from women wherever he went. As a result, according to Singh, cases of looting and rape were negligible. In addressing his troops on the matter, Manekshaw was quoted as saying: [...] "When you see a Begum (Muslim woman), <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> in your pockets, and think of Sam." ...|$|E
500|$|After {{landing at}} Toronto International Airport on May 3, 1969, Hendrix and Terry {{were the last}} to exit the plane. Ruffino was {{carrying}} Hendrix's bags, and he placed them on a counter at the customs station. An agent immediately chastised him, shouting: [...] "If that's not yours, <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> off it", to which Ruffino replied: [...] "I work for him." [...] The agent repeated the order before asking Hendrix if they were his bags; he confirmed that they were. At 9:30a.m., authorities detained Hendrix after finding {{a small amount of}} what they suspected to be heroin and hashish in his luggage. A mobile lab was set up to determine what had been found, and at 1:30p.m. Metro police detective Harry Midgley arrested him for illegal possession of narcotics. After being booked and photographed, he was released on $10,000 bail and required to return on May 5 for an arraignment hearing. [...] While they awaited the lab results, Stickells attempted to make contact with Hendrix's manager, Mike Jeffery, who had traveled to Hawaii and was unavailable.|$|E
2500|$|The Amazing Kamikaze Syndrome was {{reworked}} with {{a couple}} of alternative tracks and different artwork, and was released in North America as <b>Keep</b> <b>Your</b> <b>Hands</b> Off My Power Supply. The album was a success, getting to number 33 in the US and number 26 in Canada. The final single from the album was [...] "Slam the Hammer Down" [...] which peaked at number 92. A tour with Ozzy Osbourne was cancelled after a couple of warm-up gigs, when Lea collapsed in the dressing room after a performance. He was later diagnosed with hepatitis C. The band returned to the UK and did not tour again, mainly due to differences within the band and problems in Holder's private life.|$|E

2500|$|Hazlitt was {{ambivalent}} about Rome, the farthest {{point of his}} journey. His first impression was one of disappointment. He had expected primarily the monuments of antiquity. But, he asked, [...] "what has a green-grocer's stall, a stupid English china warehouse, a putrid trattoria, a barber's sign, an old clothes or old picture shop or a Gothic palace ... to do with ancient Rome?" [...] Further, [...] "the picture galleries at Rome disappointed me quite". Eventually he found plenty to admire, but the accumulation of monuments of art in one place was almost too much for him, and there were also too many distractions. There were the [...] "pride, pomp, and pageantry" [...] of the Catholic religion, as well as having {{to cope with the}} [...] "inconvenience of a stranger's residence at Rome....You want some shelter from the insolence and indifference of the inhabitants....You have to squabble with every one about you to prevent being cheated, to drive a hard bargain in order to live, to <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> and your tongue within strict bounds, for fear of being stilettoed, or thrown into the Tower of St. Angelo, or remanded home.

2500|$|Sheppard {{was willing}} to take a sabbatical from his church mission in the East End in order to tour Australia in 1962-63. His many friends at Lord's wanted him to captain the Fourth and Fifth Tests against Pakistan in 1962, but Sheppard had not played serious cricket for years. He made 112 for the Gentlemen and was chosen for the tour, but Ted Dexter was {{confirmed}} as captain {{for the remainder of the}} home series and the forthcoming tour of Australia. Sheppard agreed to tour and [...] "the presence in the pulpit of David Sheppard...filled the Anglican cathedral of every state capital from Perth to Brisbane" [...] Sheppard made 0 and 113 in the victorious Second Test at Melbourne, but dropped two catches and was dropped himself when he was on a pair in the second innings. He ran out his captain Ted Dexter, took a risky single for the winning run and was run out by Bill Lawry so that Ken Barrington had to come out to see Colin Cowdrey make the winning single. Although he held some good catches on the tour [...] "the ones I dropped were at such vital moments", Richie Benaud and Bill Lawry in the Second Test and Neil Harvey in the Fourth Test off Trueman, who told him [...] "The only time your hands are together are on Sunday". This is a story that increased with the telling, another version being [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> together", or that it was Sheppard who said [...] "Sorry Fred, I should have kept my hands together". One couple in Australia asked Mrs Sheppard if the Reverend could christen their baby, but she advised them not to as he was bound to drop it.|$|E
2500|$|Australia's first wicket cost England dearly. After 32 dull minutes Bill Lawry edged {{a chance}} off Len Coldwell (1/41) which John Murray took {{just off the}} grass in a dive that tore his {{shoulder}} ligaments. Lawry was out for 8, but Murray {{had to be taken}} off the field for medical treatment and Peter Parfitt took over behind the stumps (both he and Tom Graveney, who he replaced, were reserve wicket-keepers for their county). He did a reasonable job, but took no catches and few Test teams expect to do well in these circumstances. Norm O'Neill had failed in the number three spot so Neil Harvey came in and was missed in the slips by Cowdrey on 2 and lofted a gentle catch off Fred Trueman to David Sheppard at extra-cover on 37. Sheppard [...] "saw it all the way into my hands - and out of them. If ever I have wanted that secret trap-door and underground route to the pavilion it was then", Brian Statham shouted [...] "Bad luck", Trueman's comments are unprintable, but are usually translated as [...] "Pretend it's Sunday Reverend, and <b>keep</b> <b>your</b> <b>hands</b> together", Harvey hit 64 runs out of 160 in 170 minutes with only two boundaries in what Johnny Moyes thought was the worse innings of his career. He was the first victim of the Cockney off-spinner Fred Titmus (7/79) who in eight overs dismissed Harvey, Bobby Simpson, Norm O'Neill and Brian Booth for 5 runs as Australia slumped from 174/1 to 212/5 {{by the end of the}} day. [...] "Most males in the Australian population knew how to hit Titmus out of the attack but the selectors kept filling the Australian XI with the minority who did not", his flighty off-spin down the leg-side shackling the batsmen. Harvey was bowled, Simpson was caught off a cut by Ken Barrington for his third Test 90 (and the sixteenth first-class 90 of the season), O'Neill was bowled when he started a drive and changed his mind and Booth prodded one to Trueman at short leg. Barry Jarman came in as a nightwatchman, but was run out for a duck first thing in the morning, overbalancing after pushing the ball to David Sheppard at forward short-leg, who threw down the stumps. Titmus continued his good work, Alan Davidson (15) was caught at short-leg hitting across the line, Richie Benaud (15) was caught and bowled and Garth McKenzie (4) was quickly lbw. Only Barry Shepherd (71 not out) hit out at the bowlers, with 8 fours and a towering six off Titmus, the last scoring stroke of the innings. Brian Statham (1/67) bowled Colin Guest in his only Test innings after a last-wicket stand of 39 and Australia were out for 319, a lead of 40 far behind what was expected or wanted. The wisdom in the press box thought Australia needed to be 150 runs ahead seeing as they would bat last.|$|E
