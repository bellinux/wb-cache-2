5|$|For the actress, having Chloe {{become part}} of the meteor {{infected}} community in season six allowed Mack's character to continue to evolve. Mack views this transition as a means for her character to become more emotionally connected to those people—the meteor infected—she spent five seasons trying to expose to the public. Being infected by the meteors gives Chloe motivation to try to understand them and allows her to grow closer to Clark, as she can better understand {{what it feels like to}} live <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> you have a special ability. Writer Holly Harold believes that, in addition to being infected by the meteor rocks, bringing Lois into the journalistic field also provides Chloe with a lot of ammunition for growth and development. Lois's presence at the Daily Planet allows Chloe the chance to reflect upon herself, and discover what things are most important to her – her career or her family and friends. The competition that Lois provides is beneficial, as it gives Chloe a chance to bring out the best in herself.|$|E

The world's magical power is called Force, which manifests in various people as control over an element or {{aspect of the}} physical laws.

An unspecified time before {{the events of the}} game, Geyorkias, the ruler of a spirit race called the Sacred Beasts, sought to destroy the Huma as their dark emotions were fueling a primordial destructive force known as Yuris: the other Sacred Beasts put a stop to Geyorkias' plan by sealing him away, then acting to nullify Yuris' threat. The story opens with the death of Karegia's king, Ladras Lindblum, poisoned by the royal adviser Zilva Madigan: during his final moments, he releases his power into the world, causing many humans to become possessed by Force, including Veigue, Annie and Tytree. As the king has failed to name a successor, Karegia enters an interregnum at his death.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the studio's history, many {{projects}}—including Futureblight, Dwarves, Aliens: Crucible, and Stormlands—were cancelled. Due {{to having}} so many projects cancelled, the company entered a severe financial crisis in 2012. As a result, Obsidian decided to crowdfund their next game, Pillars of Eternity, a role-playing game played from an isometric perspective, which ultimately became a success and saved the studio from closure. The team's focus then changed from developing licensed titles to creating original games {{based on the}} studio's own intellectual property. Obsidian has developed {{a close relationship with}} another studio that was founded by ex-Interplay Entertainment employees, inXile Entertainment. The company's latest games are Tyranny, a role-playing game set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> the war between good and evil has been fought with evil coming out on top, and Armored Warfare, a massively multiplayer online game with a focus on controlling tanks.|$|E

25|$|According to the article, some {{contemporary}} {{ministers and}} theologians chose {{to focus on}} the life and teachings of Jesus, rather than on God, since Christ was a figure with great appeal among the broader population, but this solution ran dangerously close to ethical humanism.

25|$|Armstrong rejects nominalist {{accounts}} of properties {{that attempt to}} align properties simply with classes.

He provides an analogy to the argument in Euthyphro: to say that electrons are electrons because {{they are part of the}} class of electrons puts the cart before the horse. They are part of the class of electrons because they are electrons.|$|E

25|$|The 1819 Hamburg {{controversy}} signified a new {{pattern of}} thought {{on the part}} of the conservatives, one that the rabbi of Pressburg already embraced. Their polemics were not a mere continuation of legalistic argumentation, but a self-conscious, concerted backlash intended to safeguard the very authority of tradition. As such, most historians regard it to be the beginning of Orthodox Judaism as a modern movement, a defined, beleaguered perception which could not merely perpetuate old modes of thought. It had to defend itself actively against encroaching deviation <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>world</b> <b>where</b> the rabbis lacked all their old legal means of enforcement.|$|E
