40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{focuses on}} two strongly correlated electron systems, including Fe-based superconductivity and cobaltite magnetism. ^ Iron-based superconductors, {{a new class}} of non-Cu-based high T c superconductors, have aroused great research interest since the discovery of LaO 1 -xF xFeAs by Hosono 2 ̆ 7 s group in 2008. The 11 -type Fe-chalcogenides are structurally the simplest Fe-based superconductors, consisting only of FeX-buckled planes. We discovered a new superconducting member of the Fe-chalcogenide family: FeTeOx films. We carried out a systematic study on the crystal structure, electronic structure, transport and magnetic properties of both Fe 1 +xTe single crystal and FeTeOx thin films. X-ray absorption spectra show that oxygen incorporation changes the nominal Fe valence state dramatically, implying the important role of the Fe valence state in the superconductivity. Synchrotron and neutron diffraction experiments show a new structural transition at 12 K for superconducting FeTeOx films. Our Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) investigation reveals the presence of an energy gap (Δ 2 ̆ 6 ap; 12 meV) for FeTe single crystal, which could be expected from the SDW order but that has never been observed in previous measurements. No SDW energy gap has been observed for the FeTeO x films. A density functional calculation has been employed in studying the oxygen incorporation effects on the crystal and electronic structure of FeTe. The most stable sites for the interstitial oxygen are found to be the unoccupied; symmetry-equivalent sites of Te. Also, we studied the strain effects and observed the suppression of superconductivity in FeSe <b>filins</b> under large tensile strain. ^ An important feature of correlated materials is the presence of spontaneous phase separation driven by electronic interactions. We have studied the complex magnetism of SrCoOx, (2. 5 ≤ x ≤ 3), and discovered a new magnetic phase separation for the higher oxygen concentration regime. Previously, {{it has been reported that}} SrCoOx structurally separates into two crystalline phases for 2. 5 ≤ x ≤ 2. 75, orthorhombic SrCoO 2. 5 and cubic SrCoO 2. 75. We found here that for higher oxygen concentration, 2. 88 ≤ x ≤ 3, SrCoOx exhibits a magnetic phase separation while maintaining a single crystallographic phase. The Tcs of two magnetic components correspond to SrCoO 2. 88 and SrCoO 3 with Tc = 220 K and 280 K, respectively. A phase diagram with four line phases is proposed for SrCoOx (2. 5 ≤ x ≤ 3). ...|$|R
25|$|During the 1940s, {{the term}} descarga was {{commonly}} used in the music scenes of Cuba to refer to performances of jazz-influenced boleros in an improvised manner. This {{was part of the}} so-called <b>filin</b> (feeling) movement spearheaded by artists such as José Antonio Méndez, César Portillo de la Luz, and Luis Yánez. This style was inherited by musicians such as Bebo Valdés and Frank Emilio Flynn who explored the combination of jazz and Cuban forms into the 1950s. In particular, Bebo's 1952 session with producer Norman Granz in Havana, credited to Andre's All Stars, is often cited as a milestone in the development of Cuban jazz, and by extension, descarga. At this time, however, the term descarga began to be used in a different way to describe jam sessions based on the son montuno and other Afro-Cuban rhythms. The incipient mambo and Afro-Cuban jazz scene found in New York during the 1940s was also a catalyst of the development of descargas, with artists such as Machito, Dizzy Gillespie, Charlie Parker and Tito Puente performing extended jams with Afro-Cuban motifs.|$|E
25|$|Son {{remains the}} basis of most popular forms of modern Cuban music. Son is {{represented}} by long-standing groups like Septeto Nacional, which was re-established in 1985, Orquesta Aragón, Orquesta Ritmo Oriental and Orquesta Original de Manzanillo. Sierra Maestra, is famous for having sparked a revival in traditional son in the 1980s. Nueva trova still has influence, but the overtly political themes of the 1960s are well out of fashion. Meanwhile, Irakere fused traditional Cuban music with jazz, and groups like NG La Banda, Orishas and Son 14 continued to add new elements to son, especially hip hop and funk, to form timba music; this process was aided by the acquisition of imported electronic equipment. There are still many practitioners of traditional son montuno, such as Eliades Ochoa, who have recorded and toured widely {{as a result of}} interest in the son montuno after the Buena Vista Social Club success. Europe based Cuban female singer/songwriter Addys Mercedes merged her roots of Son and <b>Filin</b> with elements of urban, rock and pop-music, reaching mainstream airplay charts in Germany.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, Nick Gold (head of World Circuit Records) and Juan de Marcos González (director and tres {{player of}} Sierra Maestra) decided {{to record a}} series of descarga {{sessions}} featuring established Cuban musicians together with African virtuosos Toumani Diabate (kora player) and Djelimady Tounkara (guitarist). By early 1996, the Cuban musicians had been already selected and the African musicians were about to travel to Cuba, but due to difficulties in obtaining visas they could not make it. Gold then invited Ry Cooder and his son Joachim {{to participate in the}} sessions; Ry would play guitar and Joachim African percussion. The recording sessions took place in March 1996 in Havana's EGREM studios and yielded two albums released in 1997: [...] A toda Cuba le gusta, credited to the Afro-Cuban All Stars, and Buena Vista Social Club. Both albums, especially the latter, included extended descargas featuring Juan de Marcos on tres, Rubén González (who had taken part in Estrellas de Areíto) on piano, Orlando [...] "Cachaíto" [...] López (Cachao's nephew) on bass and Amadito Valdés on timbales. Buena Vista Social Club went on to become an international sensation, winning the 1998 Grammy for Best Tropical Latin Album and spawning a documentary by Wim Wenders which was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature in 1999. The album directly combined classic Cuban trova and <b>filin</b> with intense descarga jamming. The presence of laúd player Barbarito Torres, as well as Joachim Cooder's udu and dumbek, introduced seldom seen instruments into the genre.|$|E
