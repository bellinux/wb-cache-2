40|$|According to Ren-Etta Sullivan (2003) {{pathways}} {{that lead}} to career progression within the <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> sector are unclear. Furthermore {{it seems that there}} is a lack of research which underpins leadership theory in the <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> sector (Ebbeck & Waniganayake, 2004; Rodd, 2006; Scrivens, 2003; Thornton, 2003). Due to the absence of research, <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> professionals have not formed clear opinions about leadership (Ren-Etta Sullivan, 2003). This lack of opinion has lead to leadership in <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> being under researched, undefined, undervalued and under-represented in dialogue, policy and practice. This study is the investigation of how <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leaders have come to be in positions of leadership. This study explores research that underpins theories of leadership in the <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> context. Through exploring the career path of 6 <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leaders, this study gives an insight into the ideas, opinions and explanations of how the participant has come to be in positions of leadership. The overarching research questions of this study are:  How do early childhood educational leaders come to be in positions of leadership?  What career path have <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leaders taken in order to get to their position of leadership?  What experiences do early childhood educational leaders come to leadership positions with?  Is there a specific path which <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leaders have taken in order to get into positions of leadership? (Is there a pathway to becoming an <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leader?) iii Arising from these stories were personal accounts of each participant‟s experiences, professional roles and varied career journeys. Through interviewing the six <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leaders, many other insights into leadership within <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> became evident. <b>Early</b> childhood <b>education</b> leadership arena includes many different positions of leadership across a range of <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> services and departments. As Rodd (2006) states leadership is shown in different ways and means different things to different people. This study explores current ideas and perspectives about leadership in <b>early</b> childhood <b>education.</b> This study tells the story of how <b>early</b> childhood <b>education</b> has been undervalued and women dominated which has led to different approaches and understanding about leadership and a lack of interest in this area by policymakers and authoritarian figures. In spite of this, strong leaders (and mainly women) have arisen through different pathways. These leaders are likely to view leadership differently and see models of leadership needing to be different for the context of <b>early</b> childhood <b>education.</b> <b>Early</b> childhood <b>education</b> needs good leadership particularly in light of the significant growth and changes within the sector; therefore it is imperative that leadership professional development is provided, and discussions about leadership become part of early childhood contexts...|$|R
