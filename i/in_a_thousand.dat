5|$|At {{the behest}} of the Paris Observatory under le Verrier, Marie Alfred Cornu {{repeated}} Fizeau's 1848 toothed wheel measurement in a series of experiments in 1872–76. The goal was to obtain a value for the speed of light accurate to one part <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand.</b> Cornu's equipment allowed him to monitor high orders of extinction, up to the 21st order. Instead of estimating the intensity minimum of the light being blocked by the adjacent teeth, a relatively inaccurate procedure, Cornu made pairs of observations {{on either side of the}} intensity minima, averaging the values obtained with the wheel spun clockwise and counterclockwise. An electric circuit recorded the wheel rotations on a chronograph chart which enabled precise rate comparisons against the observatory clock, and a telegraph key arrangement allowed Cornu to mark on this same chart the precise moments when he judged that an extinction had been entered or exited. His final experiment was run over a path nearly three times as long as that used by Fizeau, and yielded a figure of 300400km/s that is within 0.2% of the modern value.|$|E

English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Sukarsono, M. Pd Keywords: Expressive act, Film <b>A</b> <b>Thousand</b> Words. 	The Expressive Acts {{has many}} kinds of acts that certain thing can be {{experienced}} as a feeling representation. As it reflects daily activities, every person can not ignore in expressing what is felt. Feeling should be well expressed. In this case, Expressive Acts has many functions {{that one of them}} is to express the condition of psychological states. Relating to that case, this research focuses on the expressive acts used <b>in</b> the movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words by Steve Koren. 	To focus on the case, research problems are formulated as (1) What are the types of expressive act performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words? (2) How is the formal pattern of the expressive act realization performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words? (3) What are the frequency of type and formal pattern of expressive act performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words? The purposes of this research are (1) To know the types of expressive act performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words, (2) To describe the formal pattern of expressive act realization performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words, and (3) To know the frequency of type and formal pattern of expressive act performed <b>in</b> movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words. <b>In</b> this research, the researcher used quantitative survey. The researcher investigated any conversations that consisted of expressive acts uttered by all characters <b>in</b> the movie <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> words by Steve Koren. The data of this research were taken from all characters in the movie script. Documentation was the technique of collecting the data. As research result, it has been found: (1) 22 expressive act types of thanking, 18 expressive acts of apologizing, 3 expressive acts of congratulating, 11 expressive acts of welcoming, 24 expressive acts of feeling like, 15 expressive acts of feeling dislike.

However, after doing this they realize killing the God Beasts has given more power to their main enemy, who their personal enemies were working for—the Dragon Emperor for Duran and Angela, the Dark Prince for Hawk and Lise, and the Masked Mage for Kevin and Carlie. The already powerful villain absorbs {{the power of the}} Sword of Mana and the God Beasts in order to become a god, but is halted by the Mana Goddess blocking some of its power. After defeating the villain's minions, the characters go and defeat their main enemy, but are unable to stop him from destroying the Mana Tree and eliminating all Mana from the world. The Faerie then fuses with what is left of the Mana Tree; she will be reborn as the Mana Goddess <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> years, but until then Mana will not exist in the world. As the game ends, the characters go back to their homelands.|$|E

25|$|Poetry {{submissions}} began almost immediately, as did {{short story}} submissions with lesbian themes. Book reviews of current paperbacks were regular features, including a heated exchange in print between contributors to The Ladder and author Marijane Meaker as Ann Aldrich from 1957 to 1963. Meaker {{had written the}} immensely successful Spring Fire in 1952 under the name Vin Packer and was known to the Daughters of Bilitis. Meaker's books We Walk Alone from 1955 and We, Too, Must Love from 1958 were her version of Donald Webster Cory's The Homosexual in America, a nonfiction account published in 1951 {{about what it was}} like to live as a gay man in the US. Meaker's books, published by Gold Medal Books, were distributed all over the US, and gave people in remote places an idea of what it was like to live as a lesbian. The books, however, were not particularly sympathetic to lesbians, and Del Martin and Barbara Grier took issue with Meaker's portrayals. They began to criticize the books in The Ladder and suggest that Meaker was expressing self-hatred in the books. Del Martin wrote to Meaker personally in 1958, giving her a free subscription to the magazine. Meaker's reach to women was much broader through the distribution of her books, and she received so much mail from women asking for resources and support that she was unable to respond to all of it, so she referred the letter writers to the Daughters of Bilitis. However, in print, Meaker responded to the open letters to her in The Ladder in her next book Carol <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thousand</b> Cities in 1960, by skewering the magazine's amateurish homemade appearance, fiction and poetry she did not appreciate, and the ideas presented in the magazine. Again, The Ladder responded, once more calling Meaker's loyalties into question. However negative Carol <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Thousand</b> Cities was to The Ladder, it was major advertising for the DOB and letters poured in for them from all over the U.S.|$|E

25|$|Daniel Dulaney Jr. of Maryland, {{likewise}} {{observed that}} attempting to tax subjects on the inequitable basis of 'virtual' representation was unsound because, The {{situation of the}} non-electors in England — their capacity to become electors — their inseparable connection {{with those who are}} electors, and their representatives — their security against oppression resulting from this connection, and the necessity of imagining a double or virtual representation, to avoid iniquity and absurdity, have been explained — the inhabitants of the colonies are, as such, incapable of being electors, the privilege of election being exerciseable only in person, and therefore if every inhabitant of America had the requisite freehold, not one could vote, but upon the supposition of his ceasing to be an inhabitant of America, and becoming a resident of Great-Britain, a supposition which would be impertinent, because it shifts the question — should the colonies not be taxed by parliamentary impositions, their respective legislatures have a regular, adequate, and constitutional authority to tax them, and, therefore, there would not necessarily be an iniquitous and absurd exemption, from their not being represented by the House of Commons. There is not that intimate and inseparable relation between the electors of Great-Britain, and the inhabitants of the colonies, which must inevitably involve both in the same taxation; on the contrary, not a single actual elector in England might be immediately affected by a taxation in America, imposed by a statute which would have a general operation and effect, upon the properties of the inhabitants of the colonies. The latter might be oppressed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>thousand</b> shapes, without any sympathy, or exciting any alarm in the former. Moreover, even acts, oppressive and injurious to the colonies in an extreme degree, might become popular in England, from the promise or expectation, that the very measures which depressed the colonies, would give ease to the inhabitants of Great-Britain.|$|E
