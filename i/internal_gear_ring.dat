The figure illustrates an application of the phase-oriented gearing concept to a relatively simple speed-reducing differential planetary transmission that includes a sun gear, an idler gear, three identical planet <b>gears,</b> a ground <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear,</b> and an output <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear.</b> Typically, the ground <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> and output <b>internal</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gear</b> have different numbers of teeth, giving rise to a progressive and periodic phase shift between the corresponding pairs of teeth engaged by each successive planet gear.

This is done by individually orienting each planet gea...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{article has}} carried out {{systematic}} {{research on the}} multi-tooth meshing problem of involute <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> pairs with small tooth number difference of normal gear. It firstly establishes the entity assembly model of <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> pairs with precise tooth profile, then determines the number of multi-tooth meshing teeth pairs with finite element software and finally analyzes the main factors and reason affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs. In the range of tooth number of <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> equal to 40 - 200, the conclusion is that when tooth number difference equal to 1 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 15,when tooth number difference equal to 5 the number of effective meshing teeth pairs is 3 - 11. The main factors affecting the number of meshing teeth pairs are tooth number and tooth number difference. The fewer tooth number is and the greater tooth number difference is, the fewer the number of meshing teeth pairs is. The reason is that when tooth number is obviously reduced or tooth number difference is obviously increased, the clearance of adjacent gear surface will be greatly increased, which will cause the decrease {{of the number of}} meshing teeth pairs. Within the normal value scope of modification coefficient difference of involute <b>internal</b> <b>gear</b> pairs with small tooth number difference, the influence of modification coefficient difference and modification coefficient is very small. When the torque increases, the number of effective contacting teech pairs will keep unchanged.
