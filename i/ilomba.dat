50|$|Forestry was {{the primary}} source of {{economic}} activity in the country until 1968, when the industry was supplanted by crude oil as an earner of foreign exchange. Gabon is the largest exporter of raw wood in the region, and its sales represent 20% of Africa’s raw wood exports. Forestry is second only to the petroleum sector in export earnings, at $319.4 million in 2003. Gabon’s reserves of exploitable timber include: okoumé, 100 million cubic meters; ozigo, 25-35 million cubic meters; <b>ilomba,</b> 20-30 million cubic meters; azobé, 15-25 million cubic meters; and padouk, 10-20 million cubic meters.|$|E
40|$|Niobian titanite and eudialyte {{from the}} <b>Ilomba</b> {{nepheline}} syenite complex, north Malawi DURING a chemical and mineralogical {{study of the}} <b>Ilomba</b> nepheline syenite complex, northern Malawi, titanites have been found which contain up to 11 % by weight of Nb 2 Os. Bloomfield et al. (1981) described titanite separated from aegirine pegmatite at <b>Ilomba</b> with 3. 22 % Nb 2 Os, which they {{considered to be the}} highest values of niobium recorded for this mineral. As discussed by Deer et al. (1982), the position of Nb in titanite is uncertain but the chemical data presented here indicate that it must replace t i tanium in the octahedral sites, and thus plays a similar role to the tantalum in a tantalum-rich variety of titanit...|$|E
