50|$|<b>Dual</b> <b>axis</b> {{trackers}} {{have two}} {{degrees of freedom}} that act as axes of rotation. These axes are typically normal to one another. The axis that is fixed with respect to the ground can be considered a primary axis. The axis that is referenced to the primary axis can be considered a secondary axis. There are several common implementations of <b>dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers. They are classified by the orientation of their primary axes with respect to the ground. Two common implementations are tip-tilt <b>dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers (TTDAT) and azimuth-altitude <b>dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers (AADAT). The orientation of the module with respect to the tracker axis is important when modeling performance. <b>Dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers typically have modules oriented parallel to the secondary axis of rotation. <b>Dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers allow for optimum solar energy levels due to their ability to follow the Sun vertically and horizontally. No matter where the Sun is in the sky, <b>dual</b> <b>axis</b> trackers are able to angle themselves to be in direct contact with the Sun.|$|E

40|$|Future {{large scale}} lunar {{exploration}} is impeded {{by the high}} cost of accessing the lunar surface. This cost is composed of terrestrial launch costs and the cost of developing and operating efficient lunar landers capable of delivering crew and large payloads to the lunar surface. Developing lunar landers from a platform based upon an operational upper stage minimizes development and recurring costs while increasing crew safety and reliability. The <b>Dual</b> Thrust <b>Axis</b> Lander (DTAL) lands horizontally. It uses an RL 10 engine to accomplish the descent deceleration to just above the lunar surface. Final landing is accomplished using thrusters mounted along the DTAL body. This configuration places the crew and payloads safely and conveniently close to the lunar surface. This paper describes DTAL and its benefits in supporting a robust lunar exploration program. Initial DTAL-enabled large robotic missions allow NASA to return to the moon quickly and demonstrate hardware to be used by crews that follow.

MBN and MFL measurements were made on tensile samples of hot-rolled mild steel, in which LuÌders bands were deliberately nucleated by applying tensile stress.

40|$|AbstractâThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the accuracy of a new algorithm based on dual quaternion algebra for the estimation of the finite screw axis. Eight cadavers of knee specimens were used in study. A method of fusion between CT-scan and motion as measured by a 6 d. o. f. electromagnetic device was developed. Two techniques have been implemented here, a dual quaternion algebra and the classical vector algebra methods. Results show a high dispersion in position of the finite screw axis (FSA) of 111. 58 mm when using vector algebra, when compared to 57. 01 mm when using dual quaternion algebra. It was found that the method has a significant effect on the FSA parameters. A high repeatability was found using dual quaternion algebra. It is suggested that this method is consistent and should be used when estimating the finite screw parameters.

40|$|Small Vertical Axis Wind Turbines (VAWTs) {{are good}} {{candidates}} to extract energy from wind {{in urban areas}} because {{they are easy to}} install, service and do not generate much noise; however, the aerodynamic efficiency of small turbines is low. Here-in a new turbine, with high aerodynamic efficiency, is proposed. The novel design is based on the classical H-Darrieus VAWT. VAWTs produce the highest power when the blade chord is perpendicular to the incoming wind direction. The basic idea behind the proposed turbine is to extend that said region of maximum power by having the blades continue straight instead of following a circular path. This motion can be performed if the blades turn along two axes; hence it was named <b>Dual</b> Vertical <b>Axis</b> Wind Turbine (D-VAWT). The analysis of this new turbine is done through the use of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) with 2 D and 3 D simulations. While 2 D is used to validate the methodology, 3 D is used to get an accurate estimate of the turbine performance. The analysis of a single blade is performed and the turbine shows that a power coefficient of 0. 4 can be achieved. So far, reaching performance levels high enough to compete with the most efficient VAWTs. The D-VAWT is still far from full optimization, but the analysis presented here shows the hidden potential and serves as proof of concept. The study of the D-VAWT is concluded with a preliminary parametric study of the turbine sensitivity to different incoming wind angles, turbine axes spacing, number of blades, airfoil profile and blade mounting point...|$|R
40|$|As {{part of the}} Vision for Space Exploration, NASA {{plans to}} develop a human lunar lander, known as the Lunar Surface Access Module (LSAM). A {{practical}} lunar lander must transport astronauts to the Moon, then facilitate their activities on the lunar surface. Propulsion systems using LO 2 /LH 2 propellants have several advantages, including high specific impulse main propulsion, the opportunity for synergistic application in fuel cells and life support, and compatibility with In Situ Resource Utilization (ISRU). However, due to their very low boiling points, {{it is difficult to}} design systems which retain LO 2 and LH 2 for long mission durations. This paper describes design principles based on development and operational experience with the Centaur upper stage which can be applied to build practical LO 2 /LH 2 lunar landers. These include the use of a minimum number of large propellant tanks with common bulkheads and thin-wall structure. Consideration has been given to crew and cargo operations on the lunar surface, which drive needs for lander mobility and ease of transfer between the lander cabin or cargo mounts and the ground. The low density of LH 2 means that LO 2 /LH 2 landers will have large fuel tanks which can impede crew access to the lunar surface. Three innovative design concepts are presented which incorporate the suggested propulsion design principles and address mobility and access. Concept 1 is a two-stage <b>Dual</b> Thrust <b>Axis</b> lander, which uses an axial main engine for primary descent, then rotates to land with its long axis parallel to the ground.

The central idea being developed in this research project is to design a teleoperated rehabilitation device that allows an incomplete spinal cord injured (SCI) patient to use their upper limbs, i. e. the intact portion of their neurological system, to direct the mechanical assistance of their lower limbs.

We now have an apparatus and associ-ated task for which control sharing between the hand and feet yields benefit for healthy subjects. If further exper-iments with healthy subjects can demonstrate the benefit of a hand-assisted training phase for ultimate performance with feet alone, then we shall test the hypothesis that this hand-assisted phase can accelerate rehabilitation for neuro-logically injured patients.

40|$|Emphasis of {{the present}} work is on an elegant {{real-time}} solution for GPS/INS integration. Micro-electro mechanical system (MEMS) based inertial sensors are light but not accurate enough for inertial navigation system (INS) applications. An integrated INS/GPS system provides better accuracy compared with either INS or GPS, used individually. This paper describes an improved design and fabrication of a loosely coupled INS-GPS integrated system. The systems currently available use commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware and are, therefore, not optimized for compact, single supply, and low power requirements. In the proposed system, a digital signal processor (DSP) is used for inertial navigation solution and Kalman filter computations. A {{field programmable gate array}} (FPGA) is used for creating an efficient interface of the GPS with the DSP. Direct serial interface of the GPS involve tedious processing overhead on the navigation processor. Therefore, a universal asynchronous receiver transmitter (UART) and <b>dual</b> port random <b>axis</b> memory (DPRAM) are created on the FPGA itself. This also reduces the total chip count, resulting in a compact system. The system is designed to give real time processed navigation solutions with an update rate of 100 Hz.

40|$|While {{idiopathic}} generalized epilepsies {{are thought}} to evolve from temporal highly synchronized oscillations between thalamic and cortical networks, their cellular basis remains poorly understood. Here we show in a genetic rat model of absence epilepsy (WAG/Rij) that a rapid decline in expression of hyperpolarization-activated cyclic-nucleotide gated (HCN 1) channels (I(h)) precedes the onset of seizures, suggesting {{that the loss of}} HCN 1 channel expression is inherited rather than acquired. Loss of HCN 1 occurs primarily in the apical dendrites of layer 5 pyramidal neurons in the cortex, leading to a spatially uniform 2 -fold reduction in dendritic HCN current throughout the entire somato-dendritic <b>axis.</b> <b>Dual</b> whole-cell recordings from the soma and apical dendrites demonstrate that loss of HCN 1 increases somato-dendritic coupling and significantly reduces the frequency threshold for generation of dendritic Ca 2 + spikes by backpropagating action potentials. As a result of increased dendritic Ca 2 + electrogenesis a large population of WAG/Rij layer 5 neurons showed intrinsic high-frequency burst firing. Using morphologically realistic models of layer 5 pyramidal neurons from control Wistar and WAG/Rij animals we show that the experimentally observed loss of dendritic I(h) recruits dendritic Ca 2 + channels to amplify action potential-triggered dendritic Ca 2 + spikes and increase burst firing. Thus, loss of function of dendritic HCN 1 channels in layer 5 pyramidal neurons provides a somato-dendritic mechanism for increasing the synchronization of cortical output, and is therefore likely {{to play an important role}} in the generation of absence seizure...|$|R
