40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{the status of the}} first prototype of the 60 GHz wireless Multi-gigabit data transfer topology currently under development at University of Heidelberg using IBM 130 nm SiGe HBT BiCMOS technology. The 60 GHz band is very suitable for high data rate and short distance applications as for example needed in the HEP experments. The wireless transceiver consist of a transmitter and a receiver. The transmitter includes an On-Off Keying (OOK) modulator, an Local Oscillator (LO), a Power Amplifier (PA) and a BandPass Filter (BPF). The receiver part is composed of a BandPass- Filter (BPF), a Low Noise Amplifier (LNA), a double balanced down-convert Gilbert mixer, a Local Oscillator (LO), then a BPF to remove the mixer introduced noise, an <b>Intermediate</b> <b>Amplifier</b> (IF), an On-Off Keying demodulator and a limiting amplifier. The first prototype would be able to handle a data-rate of about 3. 5 Gbps over a link distance of 1 m.

This record high energy laser output will be initiated by a single low energy, fiber -based master oscillator which will be appropriately shaped in time and frequency prior to being split into 48 beams for intermediate amplification. These 48 intermediate energy beams will feed the 192 main amplifier chains. We report on the baseline design and test results for an amplifier subsystem in the <b>intermediate</b> <b>amplifiers.</b> The subsystem is based on a diode pumped, Nd:glass regenerative amplifier.

Two fundamentally important requirements for this amplifier include output energy of 20 mJ and square pulse distortion of less than 1. 45. With a single 48 bar 4. 5 kW peak power diode array and lens duct assembly we pump a 5 mm diameter X 50 mm long Nd-doped, phosphate glass rod, and amplify the mode matched, temporally shaped (approximately 20 ns in duration) oscillator seed pulse to 25 mJof output energy with a very acceptable square pulse distortion of 1. 44.
