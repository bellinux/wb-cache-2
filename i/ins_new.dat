The WSC 2002 is available with a 4-cylinder gasoline engine thas is having a capacity of 1998 ccm. It has a power of 88 kW and enables {{a top speed of}} 160 km/h.

40|$|With the {{evolution}} of digital image acquisition devices, satellite positioning systems (GPS) and space orientation by the inertial navigation systems (<b>INS),</b> <b>new</b> applications of fast cartography, became feasible, as disaster management and environment monitoring. Such applications require periodic georeferenced information with characteristics of speed and reliability that {{can be obtained by}} digital photogrammetry, using additional data from sensors of direct orientation. However, the exterior orientation parameters (EO) provided by these sensors are under the required accuracy to remove the vertical parallax in the model. This paper presents an experimental evaluation of an approach for removing the vertical parallax of the model. This appoach is based on the reprocessing of the EO parameters provided by the sensors, using a modified coplanarity model. Some experiments with simulated and real data are presented. The experiments with simulated data were performed in order to assess the acceptable errors in the exterior orientation parameters. The experiments with real data were carried out to evaluate the vertical parallax effect, before and after the reprocessing of the EO parameters, and to access the accuracy of check points calculated by photogrammetric intersection...|$|E
