5|$|President George Washington {{appointed}} Hamilton as {{the first}} United States Secretary of the Treasury on September 11, 1789. He left office {{on the last day}} of January 1795. Much of the structure of the government of the United States was worked out in those five years, beginning with the structure and function of the cabinet itself. Biographer Forrest McDonald argues that Hamilton saw his office, like that of the British First Lord of the Treasury, as the equivalent of a Prime Minister. Hamilton oversaw his colleagues under the elective reign of George Washington. Washington requested Hamilton's advice and assistance on matters outside the purview of the Treasury Department. In 1791, while Secretary, Hamilton was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. Hamilton submitted various <b>financial</b> <b>reports</b> to Congress. Among these are the First Report on the Public Credit, Operations of the Act Laying Duties on Imports, Report on a National Bank, On the Establishment of a Mint, Report on Manufactures, and the Report on a Plan for the Further Support of Public Credit.

40|$|This paper {{studies the}} {{relation}} between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and investment efficiency on a sample of 38, 062 firm-year observations between 1980 and 2003. <b>Financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality has been posited to improve investment efficiency, but to date {{there has been little}} empirical evidence to support this claim. Consistent with this claim, I find that proxies for <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality are negatively associated with both firm underinvestment and overinvestment. The relation between <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality and underinvestment (overinvestment) is mainly driven by the innate (innate and discretionary) component of <b>reporting</b> quality. Further, <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality is more strongly associated with overinvestment for firms with large cash balances and dispersed ownership, which suggests that <b>financial</b> <b>reporting</b> quality mitigates information asymmetries arising from agency conflicts.
