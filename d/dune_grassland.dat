40|$|Question: Does grazing {{by large}} herbivores affect species {{composition}} or community-wide variation in plant functional traits? Location: <b>Dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> at the Belgian coast. Methods: Plant cover and soil {{data were collected}} in 146 plots that were randomly selected at 26 grazed and ungrazed grassland sites. Plant community composition was assessed by Detrended Correspondence Analysis and mean values of plant trait categories were calculated across the plots. Results: Differentiation of plant composition and community-wide plant trait characteristics was largely determined by grazing, soil acidity and their interaction. In ungrazed situa-tions, a clear floristic distinction appears between acidic (non-calcareous) and alkaline (calcareous) grasslands. In grazed situations, these floristic differences largely disappeared, indicating that grazing results in a decrease of natural variation in species composition. At higher soil pH, a larger difference in plant community composition and community-wide plant traits was observed between grazed and ungrazed plots. In ungrazed situations, shifts in plant functional traits along the acidity gradient were observed. Conclusions: Grazing is responsible for shifts in plant com-munity composition, and hence a decrease in plant diversity among grasslands at opposing acidity conditions in coastal <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands.</b> Therefore, care should be taken when introducing grazing as a system approach for nature conservation in <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> as it may eliminate {{part of the natural}} variation in plant diversity along existing abiotic gradients...|$|R

40|$|Atmospheric {{nitrogen}} (N) deposition {{is thought}} to accelerate ecological succession, causing a loss of diversity in species-rich <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> and hampering restoration goals. We tested whether elevated atmospheric N deposition results in faster accumulation of soil C and soil N, using three high-resolution chronosequences of up to 162 years in coastal sand dunes with contrasting N deposition and soil base status (high N deposition calcareous and acidic dunes in Luchterduinen, the Netherlands (LD) and low N deposition calcareous dunes in Newborough, UK (NB)). We also used the process model CENTURY to evaluate the relative contribution of N deposition, climate, and soil pH. In contrast to our hypothesis we found that accumulation of soil C and N was greatest at the low N deposition site NB. Model simulations indicated a negative interaction between high N deposition and symbiotic N 2 fixation. From this we conclude that high N deposition suppresses and replaces N 2 fixation as a key N source. High N deposition led to lower soil C:N only {{in the early stages}} of succession (< 20 years). The data also revealed accelerated acidification at high N deposition, which is a major concern for restoration of <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands.</b> More data are needed from acidic dunes from low N deposition areas to assess pH effects on soil C and N pools. Therefore, while N accumulation in soils may not be an issue, both acidification and plant community change due to elevated availability of mineral N remain major conservation problems. Restoration in degraded <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> should focus on maintaining habitat suitability, rather than N removal from soil pools...|$|R

40|$|Effects of high {{atmospheric}} nitrogen-deposition partly {{depend on}} availability of phosphate. Lime-poor, but iron-rich <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> are supposedly protected from grass-encroachment, due to P-fixation in iron phosphate. However, in iron-rich Dutch hinterdunes, dunes have low, but dry former beach plains high grass-encroachment. To test whether these zones differ in nutrient availability, and whether this changed with duration of grass-encroachment, we measured net N-mineralization, microbial characteristics and different fractions of P and Fe from pioneer and shortgrass to tallgrass stages approximately 10, 20 and > 25 years old. N-mineralization {{did not differ}} between zones, but increased in older tallgrass stages in the organic layer. P-availability was significantly lower in the low grass-encroachment zone, with SOM values below 3 % and mineral Fe above 40 % allowing for P-fixation in iron phosphates. In the high grass-encroachment zone, however, P-availability increased, because SOM increased and Fe became incorporated in organic matter complexes, with more reversible P-sorption. Iron-rich <b>dune</b> <b>grasslands</b> may be protected from high N-deposition and grass-encroachment only when SOM is low, because only then P-fixation in iron phosphates occurs...|$|R
