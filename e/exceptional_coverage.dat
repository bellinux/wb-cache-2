40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} role of {{services}} in the household response to trade reforms in Vietnam. The relative response of the households and income growth after a major trade liberalization in rice are analyzed aiming {{to answer the following}} questions: What type of households, in which locations, having access to what type of services, benefited more from the reforms? It focuses on services that have an impact on transaction costs (roads or quality of roads, public transportation, access to credit, extension services, and availability of markets in communication services) because transaction costs are often cited as a barrier to rural households in responding to the price changes and increased incentives offered by trade and other policy reforms. The results suggest that availability of production related services contributes positively to the impact of trade reforms. Although most of the service variables have a positive and significant effect on growth in income, some that are expected to have an impact are not significant. This may be explained by the <b>exceptional</b> <b>coverage</b> of infrastructure services in Vietnam even before the reforms. When service availability is very similar across different localities, household characteristics become more important in determining the response.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a preliminary full-waveform tomographic {{model of the}} Japan region based on spectral element wave propagation, adjoint techniques and seismic data from dense station networks. The shallow Earth structure of the Japan region {{has been the subject}} of con- siderable tomographic investigation. The islands of Japan exist in an area of significant plate complexity: subduction related to the Pacific and Philippine Sea plates is responsible for the majority of seismicity and volcanism in Japan, whilst smaller micro-plates contribute significant local intricacy. In response to the need to monitor and understand the motion of these plates and their associated faults, numerous seismograph networks have been established. This study utilises the 84 station F-net network of Japan, and the 55 station BATS network of Taiwan. This <b>exceptional</b> <b>coverage</b> is used to construct a 3 -dimensional model of the Japan region from the full-waveform inversion of over 15, 000 individual component seismograms, from 51 events that occurred between 1997 and 2012. Data is modelled using spectral-element simulations of seismic wave propagation at a regional scale over an area from 120 ◦ − 150 ◦E and 20 ◦ − 50 ◦N to a depth of around 500 km. The differences between observed and synthetic waveforms are quantified using instantaneous phase misfits allowing for the separation of both phase and amplitude measurements whilst exploiting the complete waveform at periods of 50 − 100 seconds. Fr ́echet kernels for these misfits are calculated via the adjoint method and subsequently used in an iterative non-linear conjugate-gradient optimisation scheme. Finally, custom smoothing algorithms are employed to remove the singularities of the Fr ́echet kernels, and artefacts introduced by the heterogeneous coverage in oceanic regions of the model. The resulting S-velocity model has limited resolving capability below a depth of 200 km, but is the most geographically extensive model of this region to date and re{{presents a}} significant improvement over currently available surface-wave models. The sensitivity distribution of the data to Earth structure is investigated and the model compared to the 3 -dimensional slab model, Slab 1. 0. The model provides a solid foundation on which to construct a future generation of tomographic models of this region. The model is eventually intended to further our understanding of both the complex regional tectonics and the finite rupture processes of large earthquakes...|$|E

40|$|Media {{coverage}} {{is an important}} element in the foreign policy-making process (Bennett, 1994). Mermin wrote, 2 ̆ 2 It is clear that the media are players in the construction of foreign policy debate in the United States 2 ̆ 2 (1999, p. 4). Since most Americans get their information about foreign policy from the news media, 2 ̆ 7 Journalists take on one of their greatest responsibilities 2 ̆ 2 (Mermin, p. 4). Foreign policy {{coverage is}} significant because news content may affect public opinion, which may constrain or free decision makers in the policy process (Bennett). Therefore, the content the media provide to the public is worthy of examination, specifically when reporting a potential war. If the media do not provide <b>exceptional</b> <b>coverage</b> about {{the pros and cons of}} going to war, healthy democratic debate regarding the decision cannot exist among citizens. The purpose of this thesis is to examine media coverage of President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s policy towards Iraq, which includes potential military action. The foremost consideration is just how independent the media are of administration policy when reporting a potential war. This subject has been the focus of previous studies. Dorman and Livingston (1994) wrote, 2 ̆ 2 The quality of news coverage is never more important than when a society is pondering whether to wage war 2 ̆ 2 (p. 63). Indicators of this quality can be found in whether the media distance themselves from the official administration position and provide independent, critical observations of the policy or whether the media act as mere conduits for the administration 2 ̆ 7 s policy. Evidence has suggested that the media provide coverage that is supportive of government policy; numerous studies have already shown that media coverage often reflects the level of debate in government (Bennett, 1990; Entman 2 ̆ 6 Page, 1994; Mermin, 1999; Robinson, 2 (01). However, it can be argued that a balance of opposing viewpoints needs to be presented by the media to best inform the public. A diversity of viewpoints has been considered essential to initiate and maintain a healthy democratic debate among citizens, especially when reporting about a decision as grave as going to war (Bennett; Mermin). Media studies of the Gulf War cover similar ground. Entman and Page (1994) drew four main conclusions about the media coverage prior to start of the Gulf War: 1) Criticism and support of administration policy were both reported frequently; 2) Critical information was displayed less saliently and was often procedural rather than substantive; 3) Sources with more power over war policy were given more prominence in coverage; and 4) Few fundamental criticisms of administration policy appeared. Dorman and Livingston (1994) found that media coverage prior to the start of the Gulf War was lacking in historical context and was quick to adopt administration justifications for war. Iyengar and Simon (1994) determined that media coverage throughout the Gulf War was 2 ̆ 2 heavily episodic or event-oriented 2 ̆ 2 (p. 179). Each of these reports, among others, indicates that media coverage was lacking in substantial, critical analyses of administration policy and justifications. President Bush 2 ̆ 7 s policy towards Iraq is based on disarming Iraq through military force if deemed necessary. A military engagement with Iraq would be the first American military engagement since the United States led an attack in Afghanistan that began in October of 2001. However, that intervention was characterized as a manhunt for Osama bin Laden and the early stages of an ongoing, unconventional assault on the al-Quaeda terrorist network. Additionally, the unique circumstances presented by September 11 may have affected media coverage. The media may have offered less critical coverage of the American campaign in Afghanistan as a result of the September II terrorist attacks. In this respect, it is reasonable that media coverage may have been more supportive of American efforts in Afghanistan. Since more than a year has passed since the September 11 attacks, one would expect the media to now be operating in a 2 ̆ 2 normal 2 ̆ 2 manner, providing foreign policy coverage that is not influenced or colored by those extraordinary events. A military conflict with Iraq would presumably be a conflict between nation states. As such, the use of force in Iraq would be the first traditional military engagement since the 1991 Gulf War. For these reasons, coverage of the potential war with Iraq can be considered coverage that is representative of normal coverage of a potential war. This is an important point to consider since the purpose of this study is to examine how the media cover a potential large-scale military engagement under normal conditions after September II, 200 I. The American press is an independent enterprise, free from government censorship, especially during peacetime. Therefore, the media should have every opportunity to examine all sides of an issue. Understanding the role the media assume in the post September 11 era is a critical consideration, and its importance is heightened during the preliminary stages of a military conflict...|$|E

40|$|We take {{advantage}} of the <b>exceptional</b> photometric <b>coverage</b> provided by the combination of GALEX data in the ultraviolet (UV) and the ALHAMBRA survey in the optical and near-infrared to analyse the physical properties of a sample of 1225 GALEX-selected Lyman break galaxies (LBGs) at 0. 8 ≲ z ≲ 1. 2 that are located in the COSMOS field. This is the largest sample of LBGs studied in this redshift range to date. According to a spectral energy distribution (SED) fitting with synthetic stellar population templates, we find that LBGs at z ̃ 1 are mostly young galaxies with a median age of 341 Myr and have intermediate dust attenuation, (Es(B - V)) ̃ 0. 20. Owing to the selection criterion, LBGs at z ̃ 1 are UV-bright galaxies and have a high dust-corrected total star formation rate (SFR), with a median value of 16. 9 M⊙ yr- 1. Their median stellar mass is log (M*/M⊙) = 9. 74. We find that the dustcorrected total SFR of LBGs increases with stellar mass and that the specific SFR is lower for more massive galaxies (downsizing scenario). Only 2 per cent of the galaxies selected through the Lyman break criterion have an active galactic nucleus nature. LBGs at z ̃ 1 are located mostly over the blue cloud of the colour-magnitude diagram of galaxies at their redshift, with only the oldest and/or the dustiest deviating towards the green valley and red sequence. Morphologically, 69 per cent of LBGs are disc-like galaxies, with the fractions of interacting, compact, or irregular systems being much lower, below 12 per cent. LBGs have a median effective radius of 2. 5 kpc, and larger galaxies have a higher total SFR and stellar mass. Compared with their high-redshift analogues, we find evidence that LBGs at lower redshifts are larger, redder in the UV continuum, and have a major presence of older stellar populations in their SEDs. However, we do not find significant differences in the distributions of stellar mass or dust attenuation. © 2013 The Authors Published by Oxford University Press on behalf of the Royal Astronomical Society.

40|$|Research {{background}} For almost 80 {{years the}} Chuck Taylor (or Chuck T's) All Star basketball shoe {{has been an}} iconic item of fashion apparel. The Chuck T's were first designed in 1921 by Converse, an American shoe company and over the decades they became a popular item not purely for sports and athletic purposes but rather evolved into the shoe of choice for many subcultural groups as a fashion item. In some circles the Chuck Taylor is still seen as the "coolest" sneaker of all time - one which will never go out of fashion regardless of changing trends. With over 600 millions pairs sold {{all over the world}} since its release, the Converse shoe is representative of not only a fashion culture - but also of a consumption culture - that evolved as {{the driving force behind the}} massive growth of the Western economic system during the 20 th Century.

The exhibition ran from 21 June – 16 August 2012 : Research question The Chuck T’s is one of many overwhelmingly commercially successful designs of the last century. Nowadays we are faced with the significant problems of overconsumption and the stress this causes on the natural ecosystem; and on people as a result. As an active member of the industrial design fraternity – a discipline that sits at the core of this problem - how can I use this opportunity to comment on the significant issue of consumption? An effective way to do this was to associate consumption of goods with consumption of sugar. There are significant similarities between our ceaseless desires to consume products and our fervent need to consume indulgent sweet foods. Artisan Statement Delicious, scrumptious, delectable [...] . your pupils dilate, your blood pressure spikes, your liver goes into overdrive. Immediately, your brain cuts off the adenosine receptors, preventing drowsiness. Your body increases dopamine production, in-turn stimulating the pleasure receptors in your brain. Your body absorbs all the sweetness and turns it into fat – while all the nutrients that you actually require are starting to be destroyed, about to be expelled. And this is only after one bite! After some time though, your body comes crashing back to earth. You become irritable and begin to feel sluggish. Your eyelids seem heavy while your breathing pattern changes. Your body has consumed all the energy and destroyed all available nutrients. You literally begin to shut down. These are the physiological effects of sugar consumption. A perfect analogy for our modern day consumer driven world. Enjoy your dessert! Research contribution “Converse Consumption” contributes to the conversation regarding over-consumption by compelling people to reflect on their consumption behaviour through the reconceptualising of the deconstructed Chuck T’s in an attractive edible form. By doing so the viewer has to deal with the desire to consume the indulgent looking dessert with the contradictory fact that it is comprised of a pair of shoes. The fact that the shoes are Chuck T’s make the effect even more powerful due to their iconic status. These clashing motivations are what make “Converse Consumption” a bizarre yet memorable experience.
