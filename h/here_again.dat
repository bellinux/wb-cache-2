5|$|A {{release date}} was planned for January or February 1973, with the album title rumoured to be The Light That Has Lighted the World. Within a month, {{the title was}} {{announced}} as The Magic Is <b>Here</b> <b>Again,</b> with an erroneous report in Rolling Stone magazine claiming that Eric Clapton was co-producing and that the album was set for release on 20 December 1972.|$|E
5|$|Also like Bewick, many {{articles}} {{end with}} a tail-piece, a small engraving, but <b>here</b> <b>again</b> Yarrell shows himself to be both more serious and less merely decorative than Bewick, with more information to impart. The Egyptian vulture article ends with a large and accurate engraving of another specimen, so the article shows both a young and an old bird, with clearly different plumage which is also described in the text.|$|E
5|$|Khalid {{detached}} one regiment under Dharar ibn al-Azwar {{and ordered}} him to attack {{the front of the}} army of Dairjan (left center) {{in order to create a}} diversion and threaten the withdrawal of the Byzantine right wing from its advanced position. With the rest of the cavalry reserve he attacked Gregory's flank. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> under simultaneous attacks from the front and flanks, the Byzantines fell back, but more slowly because they had to maintain their formation.|$|E

5|$|In mid-August Pilecki's Company {{occupied}} the insurgent stronghold in the Railway Post Office {{connected to the}} Warszawa Gdańska station. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> {{he and his men}} would hold out against frequent German attempts to dislodge them. Pilecki would keep this position in insurgent hands for six weeks and was ejected only after a specialized German task force was brought in and drove the partisans out using flame throwers and explosives. After the capitulation of the uprising, Pilecki hid a cache of weapons in a private apartment and surrendered to the Wehrmacht on October 5, 1944. He was imprisoned at Stalag VIII-B, a German prisoner-of-war camp near Lamsdorf, Silesia. He was later transferred to Oflag VII-A in Murnau, Bavaria where he was liberated by troops of the US 12th Armored Division on April 28, 1945.|$|E
5|$|The {{magistrates court}} {{continued}} to cover significant trials that were widely {{reported by the}} media. In 1963, Christine Keeler was tried here for attempting to obstruct the course of justice. In the late 1960s, a number of rock stars, including The Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger, Keith Richards and Brian Jones, stood trial on drugs offences at the magistrates court. Richards was tried <b>here</b> <b>again</b> in 1973 for possession of heroin and owning unlicensed firearms, but was only fined £205 (now £). John Lennon and Yoko Ono were tried for obscenity here in 1970. The building became Grade II listed in 1970. The courts closed in 1998, and are now the Courthouse Hotel.|$|E

25|$|A more {{complicated}} example is 8*3.1.2 0.1.1.1.1.1 <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> 8* {{refers to a}} basic polyhedron with 8 vertices. The periods separate the notation for each tangle.|$|E
25|$|The plate flaws {{exist for}} all the values of all the printings and their number is very important. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> a {{specific}} collection is totally justifiable.|$|E
25|$|Exact {{measurement}} {{was also}} {{key to the}} development of machine tools. <b>Here</b> <b>again</b> Babbage is considered a pioneer, with Henry Maudslay, William Sellers, and Joseph Whitworth.|$|E

Heavenly Days was also included in the January 2014 DVD release of <b>Here</b> We Go <b>Again</b> as part of a [...] "double feature" [...] DVD. Look Who's Laughing, <b>Here</b> We Go <b>Again</b> and Heavenly Days have been featured on Turner Classic Movies.|$|R
25|$|The {{resonators}} are encapsulated {{either by}} bonding cover wafers onto the resonator wafers or by depositing thin film encapsulation layers over the resonators. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> both methods are used commercially.|$|E
25|$|The second battle, {{some twenty}} years later, took place around Chocontá {{in the north}} of the Bogotá savanna between the zipa and the zaque. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> Saguamanchica {{defeated}} his stronger enemy Michuá of around 60,000 warriors in a three hour fight. Both leaders died because of the bloody battle.|$|E
25|$|In November 1776, after Thunberg had {{returned}} from his trip to the shogun's court, he left Japan {{and went on to}} Java, an island that nowadays belongs to Indonesia. From there on, he travelled to Ceylon in July 1777, today's Sri Lanka. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> his major interest lay in collecting plants and other specimen.|$|E

25|$|<b>Here</b> <b>again</b> the snub 24-cell, {{with the}} {{symmetry}} group + this time, represents an alternated truncation of the truncated 24-cell creating 96 new tetrahedra {{at the position}} of the deleted vertices. In contrast to its appearance within former groups as partly snubbed 4-polytope, only within this symmetry group it has the full analogy to the Kepler snubs, i.e. the snub cube and the snub dodecahedron.|$|E
25|$|The Portuguese {{would soon}} {{increase}} Recife's defenses and forts were {{built on the}} isthmus between Recife and Olinda to deter subsequent attacks but to little avail. The Dutch would return <b>here</b> <b>again</b> and again before being forced out by the mid 1600s by the Portuguese. The attack on Recife however goes {{down in history as}} being the last attack ever made by the English on the coast of Brazil.|$|E
25|$|Selah {{is used in}} Iyaric Rastafarian vocabulary. It can {{be heard}} {{at the end of}} spoken-word {{segments}} of some reggae songs. Its usage <b>here,</b> <b>again,</b> is to accentuate the magnitude and importance of what has been said, and often is a sort of substitute for Amen. Notable, according to Rastafarian faith, is also the word's similarity with the incarnated god and savior Selassie (Ethiopia's former emperor Haile Selassie).|$|E

25|$|In the {{beginning}} of 1920, the British struck the Dervish settlements with a well-coordinated air and land attack and inflicted a stunning defeat. The forts of Hassan were damaged and his army suffered great losses. They hastily fled to Ogaden. <b>Here,</b> <b>again</b> {{with the help of}} his patriotic poetry and charisma, he tried to rebuild his army and accomplish the coalition of Ogaden clans, which made him a power in the land once again.|$|E
25|$|That year {{also saw}} the massive strikes that began in Gastonia, North Carolina, and Elizabethton, Tennessee, which were violently {{suppressed}} by local police and vigilantes. <b>Here</b> <b>again,</b> workers were often more militant than their trade union leadership: to take one striking example, the workers at the Loray Mill in Gastonia walked out {{under the leadership of}} the communist-led National Textile Workers Union. The Communist Party founded the NTWU in its short-lived attempt to create revolutionary unions.|$|E
25|$|Kent {{took him}} on in 1998, but <b>here</b> <b>again</b> he was {{frustrated}} in his ambitions: he played only twice, {{and his three}} wickets cost more than 51 runs apiece. In June and July he had a terrible run, going seven first and second-team games without a wicket, although he followed that up with a fine run in the seconds, taking 30 wickets in six successive innings; this, however, {{was not enough to}} win him back his place in the first eleven.|$|E
