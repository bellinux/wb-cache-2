40|$|AbstractThe paper {{presents}} an innovative methodology of coupling the conventional finite element <b>machining</b> <b>simulations</b> with {{computational fluid dynamic}} (CFD) model to analyse the temperature distribution at the cutting tool. The conventional finite element <b>machining</b> <b>simulations</b> were conducted using DEFORM 2 D to predict the heat generation and tool tip temperature during the cutting action. <b>Machining</b> <b>simulations</b> were conducted using Ti 6 Al 4 V and uncoated carbide as a workpiece and tool material respectively. Modified version of Johnson-Cook constitutive model was incorporated in the conventional finite element based <b>machining</b> <b>simulations</b> to predict the behavior of flow stresses for Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy. Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations were performed using ANSYS® CFX. CFD model has incorporated air as a cooling media to simulate the dry cutting and temperature distribution at the tool surface was obtained. The coupled numerical modeling methodology showed encouraging potential of predicting precise temperature distribution on the cutting tool.

40|$|Abstract—In-vehicle {{infotainment}} applications {{often have}} to contend with different degrees of unpredictability. These applications can benefit if they can specify quality requirements to the service they access. This paper presents our attempt to apply Model Driven Architecture (MDA) technology to integrate the Quality of Service (QoS) requirements for In-vehicle <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> Interface (HMI) clients of infotainment applications. QoS subsystem of <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> Interface framework provides the essential QoS modelling support to specify QoS related requirements. QoS modelling constructs and components of the Infotainment <b>Human</b> <b>Machine</b> Interface Framework (iHMIFw) support construction of platform independent model of infotainment HMI applications with required QoS specifications. A model transformation has been described that is supported by the framework and results into XML description of QoS specifications.
