40|$|Preliminary {{results of}} shearographic {{inspections}} {{of the shuttle}} external tank (ET) spray-on foam insulation (SOFI) and solid rocket booster (SRB) Marshall sprayable ablative (MSA- 2) epoxy-cork thermal protection systems (TPS) and remote manipulator system (RMS) honeycomb are presented. Debonding SOFI or MSA- 2 damage the orbiter belly tile and exposes the ET/SRB to thermal loading. Previous work with the ET/SRB showed promising results with shearography. The first area investigated was the <b>jack</b> <b>pad</b> close-out, one of many areas on the ET where foam is applied at KSC. Voids 0. 375 inch were detected in 1. 75 inch thick foam using a pressure reduction of less dm 0. 4 psi. Of primary interest are areas of the ET that directly face the orbiter tile TPS. It is estimated that 90 % of tile TPS damage on the orbiter 'belly' results from debonding SOFI during ascent. Test panels modeling these areas were manufactured with programmed debonds to determine the sensitivity of shearography {{as a function of}} debond size, SOFI thickness, and vacuum. Results show a Probability of Detection (POD) of. 95 or better for of debonds with a diameter equal to the SOFI thickness at less than 0. 4 psi pressure reduction. Preliminary results are also presented on inspections of MSA- 2 and the remote manipulator system (RMS) honeycomb material...|$|R
50|$|In {{a modern}} test, {{a direct hit}} from a steel bodkin point {{penetrated}} mail armour, although at point blank range. However, the test was conducted without a <b>padded</b> <b>jack</b> or gambeson, which was layered cloth armour worn over heavier armour for protection against projectiles, as it was known to stop even heavy arrows.|$|R
50|$|A gambeson (or aketon or <b>padded</b> <b>jack</b> or arming doublet) is {{a padded}} {{defensive}} jacket, worn as armour separately, or combined with mail or plate armour. It also doubled as a winter coat for wearers. Gambesons were produced with a sewing technique called quilting. Usually constructed of linen or wool, the stuffing varied, {{and could be}} for example scrap cloth or horse hair. During the 14th century, illustrations usually show buttons or laces up the front.|$|R
50|$|By the 14th century, plate armour was {{commonly}} used to supplement mail. Eventually mail was supplanted by plate for the most part, as it provided greater protection against windlass crossbows, bludgeoning weapons, and lance charges. However, mail was still widely used by many soldiers as well as brigandines and <b>padded</b> <b>jacks.</b> These three types of armour made {{up the bulk of}} the equipment used by soldiers, with mail being the most expensive. It was sometimes more expensive than plate armour. Mail typically persisted longer in less technologically advanced areas such as Eastern Europe but was in use everywhere into the 16th century.|$|R

50|$|There are two {{distinctive}} {{designs of}} gambeson; those {{designed to be}} worn beneath another armour, and those designed to be worn as independent armour. The latter tend to be thicker and higher in the collar, and faced with other materials, such as leather, or heavy canvas. This variant is usually referred to as <b>padded</b> <b>jack</b> and made of several (some say around 18, some even 30) layers of cotton, linen or wool. These jacks were known to stop even heavy arrows and their design of multiple layers bears {{a striking resemblance to}} modern day body armor, which substituted at first silk, ballistic nylon and later Kevlar as fabric.|$|R
2500|$|John Madden, {{coach of}} the 1972 Raiders, {{has said that he}} will never get over the play, and has {{indicated}} that he was bothered more by the delay between {{the end of the play}} and the final signal of touchdown than by which player the ball truly hit. After the game, he indicated that from his view the football had indeed touched Tatum. Although a few days later Madden indicated that the Raiders game films showed that the ball hit Fuqua's shoulder <b>pads,</b> <b>Jack</b> Tatum conceded that [...] "even after we viewed the game films with stop action, nobody could tell who the ball hit on that moment of impact." [...] Years later Madden wrote, [...] "No matter how many times I watch the films of the 'immaculate reception' play, I never know for sure what happened." ...|$|R
5000|$|A bec de corbin {{is a type}} of pole {{weapon and}} war hammer that was popular in medieval Europe. The name is Old French for [...] "raven's beak" [...] or [...] "beak of the crow". Similar to the Lucerne hammer, it {{consists}} of a modified hammer's head and spike mounted atop a long pole. Unlike the Lucerne hammer, the bec de corbin was used primarily with the 'beak' or fluke to attack instead of the hammer head. The hammer face balancing the beak was often blunt instead of the multi-pronged Lucerne, and the beak tended to be stouter; better designed for tearing into thinner plate armor, chainmail or <b>padded</b> <b>jacks</b> [...] Also, the spike mounted on the top of head was not nearly as long and thin as in the Lucerne. Bec de corbin occasionally becomes a catchall for any type of warhammer, such as a maul or a horseman's pick.|$|R
40|$|Beam {{stability}} {{is a major}} concern for the operation of the APS. One of the many contributing factors to electron-beam in{{stability is}} mechanical vibration of the accelerator components especially the focusing magnets. The electron beam should be stable to 5 % of its rms size to maintain the specified photon beam stability. The APS uses steel girders to support the conventional magnets and vacuum chambers in the storage ring (SR). Three pedestal and jack assemblies support the girders. Damping pads are presently installed between the pedestals and the <b>jacks.</b> These damping <b>pads</b> {{have been shown to be}} very effective in reducing the fundamental girder-vibration mode. The horizontal vibration levels of the SR quadrupole magnets are presently within specification at between two and four times the ground motion, i. e., 50 - 100 nm rms (4 - 50 Hz). Future improvements to the APS beam quality would require a further reduction in girder vibration. Several options for reducing the vibration of the girders and magnets are discussed, and the measurement results are presented...|$|R
