40|$|Abstractï¼šBy {{simulating}} {{the runner}} of the VARI molding process with PAM-RTM about the front {{floor of the}} car, examines the different injection methods, different influence of distance of <b>hose</b> <b>guide</b> for filling time, analyzing the resin flow patterns, {{the effects of the}} mold cavity pressure distribution and the overflow outlet location on the floor molding, and got the shortest time of program filling of the floor. From a test about VARI molding of the floor on the former basis, got the filling time 820 s and it is consistent with simulation results 982 s. The research results have important significance for research and application of carbon fiber composites. 1...|$|E
40|$|In this thesis, {{the work}} to develop the vision system for the Emulsion Loading Automation Project (ELAP) is presented. The ELAP project was a {{collaborative}} effort among various team members to develop an intelligent system to automate the complex task of an emulsion loader used in underground mining operations. The vision system was tasked with the challenging imaging requirements of locating and identifying drill-holes in the rock face of an underground mine, and to provide visual guidance for the <b>hose</b> <b>guide</b> to load the drill-holes with emulsion. The {{first part of this}} thesis outlines the development of image processing algorithms to segment and identify drill-holes present in an image acquired from a video stream. This involved applying thresholding and morphological techniques to preprocess the image to improve contrast, separate touching objects, and fill any holes. A pattern recognition model was then developed using drill-hole feature data to classify segmented objects as either drill-holes or background artifacts. The second part of this thesis presents the work performed for visual guidance to position the robotic boom in front of a drill-hole for loading. Using a camera mounted {{to the end of a}} robotic boom, camera and hand-eye calibration routines were developed to transform the drill-hole image object to both the camera and end-effector reference frames. A visual guidance algorithm was then developed using the calibration parameters to visual servo the robotic boom to a drill-hole for loading. Finally, testing performed in an underground mine after the critical subsystems were integrated and operational, verified the vision system operation as designed...|$|E

This gives the customer the secure knowledge that he/she cannot descend too deep and allows them to choose the depth that they feel most comfortable with while being able to control their depth, descent and ascent rates. By utilizing the <b>hose</b> as a <b>guide,</b> combined with wearing soft weights to achieve neutral buoyancy, participants are able to descend anywhere from just under the surface to 6 m deep.|$|R
