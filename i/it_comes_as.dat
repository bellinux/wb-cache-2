It {{was designed by}} Astro Studios in cooperation with Hers Experimental Design Laboratory. In June 2010 a redesign of the console, known as the Xbox 360 S, was announced. This version of the console retains the same basic shape but is noticeably smaller and more angular than the original version. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> {{standard in}} either matte or glossy black; like its predecessor, other colors are available as special editions.|$|E

25|$|Chorea {{is another}} {{condition}} which results from {{damage to the}} basal ganglia. Similar to athetosis, it results from mutations affecting the pallidum inhibition of the thalamus as well as increased dopaminergic activity {{at the level of}} the striatum. Considering the etiology of both disorders are fairly similar, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> no surprise that chorea and athetosis can and usually do occur together in a condition called choreoathetosis.|$|E
25|$|From {{the point}} of view of Albert Einstein's theory, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> no {{surprise}} that all attempts to treat gravity simply like one more quantum force (on par with electromagnetism and the nuclear forces) have failed. According to Einstein, gravity is not a force – it is a property of space-time itself. Loop quantum gravity is an attempt to develop a quantum theory of gravity based directly on Einstein's geometrical formulation.|$|E
25|$|When Maggie is {{apparently}} murdered by {{a serial killer}} in 2003, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a shock when Mickey starts a relationship with Bonnie Lockhart. Bonnie was Maggie's nemesis, and former housekeeper. This relationship lasts {{for the better part}} of 2003, and into much of 2004. Maggie is found on the island of Melaswen (New Salem spelled backwards). Maggie returns to Salem only to learn her husband Mickey is in a relationship with Bonnie. A furious and embarrassed Maggie tries everything to win back his love. This is about the time that longtime veteran John Clarke retired as Mickey Horton, and is replaced by actor John Ingle.|$|E

25|$|The book begins {{immediately}} {{following the death of}} Zosima. It is a commonly held perception in the town, and the monastery as well, that true holy men's bodies are incorrupt, i.e., they do not succumb to putrefaction. Thus, the expectation concerning the Elder Zosima is that his deceased body will not decompose. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a great shock to the entire town that Zosima's body not only decays, but begins the process almost {{immediately following}} his death. Within the first day, the smell of Zosima's body is already unbearable. For many this calls into question their previous respect and admiration for Zosima. Alyosha is particularly devastated by the sullying of Zosima's name due to nothing more than the corruption of his dead body. One of Alyosha's companions in the monastery named Rakitin uses Alyosha's vulnerability to set up a meeting between him and Grushenka. However, instead of Alyosha becoming corrupted, he is able to earn fresh faith and hope from Grushenka, while Grushenka's troubled mind begins the path of spiritual redemption through his influence: they become close friends. The book ends with the spiritual regeneration of Alyosha as he embraces, kisses the earth outside the monastery (echoing, perhaps, Zosima's last earthly act before his death) and cries convulsively until finally going back out into the world, as Zosima instructed, renewed.|$|E
500|$|Critics often {{describe}} {{the language that}} García Márquez's imagination produces as visual or graphic, and he himself explains each of his stories is inspired by [...] "a visual image," [...] so <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> no surprise {{that he had a}} long and involved history with film. He was a film critic, he founded and served {{as executive director of the}} Film Institute in Havana, was the head of the Latin American Film Foundation, and wrote several screenplays. For his first script he worked with Carlos Fuentes on Juan Rulfo's El gallo de oro. His other screenplays include the films Tiempo de morir (1966), (1985) and Un señor muy viejo con unas alas enormes (1988), as well as the television series Amores difíciles (1991).|$|E
500|$|After {{completing}} 100% Love, Sukumar {{began working}} on , a psychological thriller keeping Mahesh Babu in mind as the protagonist as he felt that Mahesh had a universal appeal in terms of looks. The incident of a bus driver talking about a young boy who claims that his parents were murdered in that bus was taken as the story's base. He worked on the film's script for two months, and considered it as his dream project. 1: Nenokkadine was released on 10 January 2014 globally and received generally negative reviews from the critics. While Suresh Kavirayani of Deccan Chronicle opined that Sukumar [...] "fails to deliver" [...] and the story is [...] "run of the mill", Sangeetha Devi Dundoo of The Hindu stated, [...] "Habitual to watching films that begin with a great premise only {{to fall into the}} commercial trap of force-fit comic situations, <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a relief when Sukumar laces the psychological thriller with subtle wit that never takes the focus away from the plot". 1: Nenokkadine collected approximately 289 million worldwide on a budget of 700 million, thus becoming a commercial failure.|$|E

500|$|Robyn Brothers {{felt the}} line [...] "I'd break {{bread and wine}} / If there was a church I could receive in" [...] {{referenced}} feelings of spiritual alienation. She compared the song to [...] "Zooropa", stating that both reference a response to uncertainty and an unavoidable feeling of alienation. Writing for Uncut, Gavin Martin wondered if the lyric [...] "What {{are we going to}} do now it's all been said / No new ideas in the house, and every book has been read" [...] was an examination of the band's longevity, stating [...] "Bono sounded fragile, wounded, seeming even to ponder the band's usefulness." [...] He noted that it contained references to both Holy Communion and oral sex, and compared it to [...] "The Fly", noting that both songs were [...] "delivered in an amoral voice" [...] and helped to deconstruct the prevailing image of the band. Artist Gavin Friday, a childhood friend of Bono, thought the chorus line [...] "Don't let the bastards grind you down" [...] was a retaliation to the criticism of the press. Elizabeth Wurtzel of The New Yorker felt the line gave the song a political, martyr-complex. She noted that it eventually [...] "unfurls as a song about love facing the long run. <b>It</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a relief to discover, after all this time, that the guys in U2 are as hormonally charged and concerned with love as the rest of us." ...|$|E
500|$|A {{couple of}} months later, Toyah {{received}} a letter from Phil asking her to visit him in prison and in return he would plead guilty to raping her. Until the letter arrived, Toyah had been piecing her life back together by getting her job back at the Rovers and starting a romance with Sam. Of how Toyah felt about the letter, Taylor told Adrian Lobb from Inside Soap, [...] "By the time Toyah gets the letter, she has grown a little stronger. But <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a complete surprise. Toyah doesn't trust Phil, obviously, and she thinks he's playing games. While part of her wants to confront him about the attack, there's another side of her that wants to let it go, and just leave it to the courts to deal with him." [...] Toyah agreed to Phil's request to visit him and Taylor said that Toyah believed that seeing Phil in person would help her {{to come to terms with}} what happened. When Toyah came face to face with Phil, her first thought was how pathetic he looked. When Phil tried to make excuses for what he had done, Toyah did not feel any pity and told him to plead guilty, which he agreed to do. Toyah left the prison feeling [...] "tearful, but triumphant" [...] and Taylor commented that while she would never fully recover from her ordeal, Toyah was determined to look towards the future.|$|E
500|$|The Sleeping Dragon {{received}} highly positive {{reviews from}} most critics and sold {{a few hundred}} thousand copies. eToychest gave the game a 5 out of 5, saying [...] "Broken Sword: The Sleeping Dragon is a shining example of what this genre is capable of, and <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> close to perfection as any recent adventure game has." [...] Just Adventure gave the game an A+, saying: [...] "A triumph. It’s {{at the same time a}} real 3D game and a crackerjack pure adventure. High levels of craftsmanship and designer TLC are evident throughout the game. Playing it is like falling into an exciting movie thriller." [...] Gaming Chronicles gave it a 9.2 out of 10, saying that [...] "adventure gaming is alive and well thanks to designers like Revolution" [...] and that it's a stunning achievement in interactive entertainment, praising its story, characters, visuals, and dialogue, and calling it a [...] "must-own title for anyone looking to relive the golden era of adventure gaming"; they did, however, indicate that the controls were too easy at times. Edge magazine gave the game a 9, praising the storytelling, dialogues and visuals, and while pointing out some sporadic glitches that break the illusion Edge magazine refers to this game as [...] "a fairytale comeback" [...] and [...] "the adventure's glorious return". IGN gave the game a rating of 8.4, placing it under the [...] "Impressive" [...] category, but noted that the interface was difficult to use and the puzzles in the game were repetitive. Adventure Gamers gave it 4 out of 5 stars, called it a [...] "technical masterpiece", and praised its cinematic introduction, cutscenes, lifelike character faces, and said [...] "it certainly raise the bar for any seen in adventures to this date", but criticised its controls and repetitive puzzles. GameSpot had an overall positive review; their Scott Osborne praised its plot, characters, and setting, and (unlike most) found the interface to have its points, although he was frustrated with times in which quick reflexes are required and bored (like most) with some of the puzzles; he also ran into a sound problem, which does not appear to have happened to any other reviewer. Although Laura MacDonald of Mr. Bill's Adventureland panned its repetitive puzzles, she called it an [...] "instant classic" [...] and praised its story, controls, characters and music. Steven Carter of Game Over Online was less positive (criticising its plot, interface, and puzzles calling most of the last [...] "trivially easy"), but did praise its general appearance, voice acting, and music. Computer Games Magazine was less positive, mainly due to heavily criticising the interface.|$|E

2500|$|With {{decades of}} illegal logging in Madagascar's {{protected}} areas <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> little surprise that evidence of closely associated activities, such as slash-and-burn agriculture, tree cutting, honey extraction, and bushmeat hunting, {{were discovered in}} Marojejy National Park by a research team in 2008. [...] With the recent political instability, these transgressions have increased in frequency and severity along with the illegal logging, and now threaten the existence of critically endangered lemurs and other species. [...] This has done irreparable damage and jeopardized over thirty years of conservation work.|$|E
2500|$|While Rognvald {{does appear}} to have {{had some kind of}} role in the {{founding}} of the Norse Earldom of Orkney, most historians now doubt claims in the Sagas that Rognvald led one particular [...] "great voyage" [...] – a Norwegian expedition that attacked rebel vikings, who had been raiding Norway from bases on Orkney and Shetland, before raiding the Scottish mainland, Ireland and the Isle of Man. It is now generally believed that any such expedition would have occurred after Rognvald's lifetime. A modern authority on Orcadian history, WilliamP.L. Thomson, comments that the story of the [...] "great voyage is so thoroughly ingrained in popular and scholarly history, both ancient and modern, that <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a bit of a shock to realise that it might not be true." ...|$|E
2500|$|Richard Cohen responded via {{his regular}} Washington Post column {{published}} on February 6, 2007. Cohen {{noted that he}} has dedicated more than 90 columns to condemning antisemitism since he started as a columnist in 1976, [...] "most of them full-throated condemnations of the hatred that killed fully one-third of all Jews during my lifetime. So <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> a surprise that has {{the force of a}} mugging to be accused of aiding the very people I so hate – of being an abettor of something called The New Anti-Semitism." [...] Cohen wrote that the report [...] "has given license to the most intolerant and narrow-minded of Israel's defenders so that, as the AJC concedes in my case, any veering from orthodoxy is met with censure or, from someone like Reinharz, the most powerful of all post-Holocaust condemnations – anti-Semite – is diluted beyond recognition. The offense here is not just to a handful of relatively unimportant writers, but to memory itself." ...|$|E

2500|$|... 18. It {{is to be}} {{anticipated}} that perhaps not everyone will easily accept this particular teaching. There is too much clamorous outcry against {{the voice of the}} Church, and this is intensified by modern means of communication. But <b>it</b> <b>comes</b> <b>as</b> no surprise to the Church that she, no less than her divine Founder, is destined to be a [...] "sign of contradiction.") She does not, because of this, evade the duty imposed on her of proclaiming humbly but firmly the entire moral law, both natural and evangelical. Since the Church did not make either of these laws, she cannot be their arbiter—only their guardian and interpreter. It could never be right for her to declare lawful what is in fact unlawful, since that, by its very nature, is always opposed to the true good of man. In preserving intact the whole moral law of marriage, the Church is convinced that she is contributing {{to the creation of a}} truly human civilization. She urges man not to betray his personal responsibilities by putting all his faith in technical expedients. In this way she defends the dignity of husband and wife. This course of action shows that the Church, loyal to the example and teaching of the divine Savior, is sincere and unselfish in her regard for men whom she strives to help even now during this earthly pilgrimage [...] "to share God's life as sons of the living God, the Father of all men".|$|E
