40|$|<b>Aujeszky’s</b> <b>disease</b> (pseudorabies) is {{a highly}} contagious, {{economically}} significant disease of pigs. This viral infection causes central nervous system (CNS) signs and high mortality rates in young animals, and respiratory illness in older pigs.

40|$|A {{competitive}} nzyme immunoassay {{was developed}} to detect antibodies to a glycoprotein (gI) of <b>Aujeszky's</b> <b>disease</b> virus. Infected cell monolayers were used as antigen and a monoclonal antibody directed against an epitope of gI as indicator antibody.

The antibody to the gI epitope persisted for at least 15 weeks.

This epizootiological disease has been present in our country for quite some time now, and it has been increasingly frequently diagnosed in carnivora in the recent years. The objective of the investigations was to determine and establish the pathways for the transfer and the manner of spreading of the MA virus to carnivora. Epizootiological data on the appearance of MA, collected in the field, as well as an epizootiological report by the Serbian Ministry of Agriculture and of the Federal Ministry for Agriculture were used as material. Detailed epizootiological, clinical, pathomorphological, and laboratory analyses were performed in five critical spots for MA registered in the territory of Vojvodina province. We established the following pathways for the spread of the MA viral infection to carnivora: the consumption of thermally unprocessed swine carcasses, the consumption of thermally unprocessed pork originating from butcher shops or from regular slaughter on private farms, the consumption of viscera from emergency slaughtered sheep, cohabitation and contact with infected swine, and vaccination using a live vaccine contaminated with the MA virus...|$|R
40|$|Eradication of <b>Aujeszky's</b> <b>disease</b> from a {{large-scale}} pig farm by the 'test-and-cull' eradication procedure {{based on the}} use of gene-deleted vaccines and serological monitoring using gE ELISA is described. <b>Aujeszky's</b> <b>disease</b> free status was successfully achieved on a farrow-to-finish type farm characterised by three difficulties interfering with the success of eradication: (i) weaned (30 -day-old) piglets remained in the farrowing house until 65 days of age; (ii) the farm did not use nursery rearing; (iii) fatteners were kept together with the breeding gilts. Thus, the immunisation programme had to be adjusted to the management technology used on the farm, and by regular serological monitoringit had to be periodically modified to make it suitable for attaining the goals. This meant that breeding animal candidates of a wide age range and kept in the same air space had to be provided with a continuously high-level immunity by regular vaccination sufficient even for rectifying potential human errors. The immunisation programme was designed by taking into consideration the disappearance of maternal immunity, and a strict vaccination programme was applied during the rearing of breeding gilts kept together with the fattening pigs. Frequent immunisation applied during the rearing of the own breeding animal replacements proved to be of decisive importance for the eradication of <b>Aujeszky's</b> <b>disease</b> from the entire herd.

The cDNA encoding N-terminus of pLF was cloned into a Lactobacillus-specific plasmid to produce L. pentosus pLF expressing transformants (pPG 612. 1 -pLFN/ L. pentosus). The antimicrobial activity of the recombinant pLF protein inhibited bacterial growth in vitro. The supernatant of pPG 612. 1 -pLF-N/L. pentosus had an inhibitory effect on Staphylococcus aureus strain CVCC 26003, Bacillus subtilis strain CVCC 63501, Escherichia coli strain CVCC 10141 and Salmonella enterica ssp. enterica Choleraesuis strain CVCC 79102, while it did not inhibit the growth of Lactobacillus casei strain ATCC 393. A mouse model was established to test the effectiveness of the orally administered probiotic L. pentosus recombinant strain in the gastrointestinal tract. Mice were immunised with an attenuated porcine <b>Aujeszky’s</b> <b>disease</b> virus (ADV) vaccine.

40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to analyse the {{prevalence}} of single-reactor (SR) pigs in Poland, to attempt an explanation for this phenomenon, and to assess whether the occurrence of SR pigs could create problems for a successful <b>Aujeszky’s</b> <b>disease</b> virus (ADV) eradication programme in Poland.
