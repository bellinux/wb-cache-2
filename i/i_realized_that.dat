5|$|Today {{those songs}} are {{classics}} but, at that time, {{they were considered}} cutting edge. Eventually <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{most of them are}} threaded by the songwriting tradition of our country. They are Argentine songs. The real avant-garde revolutionizes what it inherits. Almendra was heir to the best Argentine music, and combined its elements without prejudice.|$|E
5|$|<b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> for a {{long time}} I had been holding onto this whole dogma of nonracism almost like a religion... But in the course of that debate I began to feel there was a lot lacking in the proponents of the nonracist idea... they had this problem, you know, of superiority, and they tended to take us for granted and wanted us to accept things that were second-class. They could not see why we could not {{consider}} staying in that church, and I began to feel that our understanding of our own situation in this country was not coincidental with that of these liberal whites.|$|E
5|$|The Bulgarian monarch was {{satisfied}} with the results and considered that he had superiority over the Byzantine Empire to achieve his political ambitions— to assume the throne in Constantinople. Despite the success, however, Simeon <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{there was still a}} lot {{to do in order to}} prevail over the Empire for good. He needed his own political and ideological base and launched an ambitious construction programme in Preslav so that it could rival Constantinople. In addition, Simeon I took precautions to reduce the Byzantine influence over the Western Balkans by imposing his authority over the Principality of Serbia in return for recognizing Petar Gojniković as its ruler.|$|E
5000|$|... “My art is {{the result}} of my many years working in science and physics, {{encompassing}} a career focused on 3D measurement devices. ... Parleau is about realizations. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> when <b>I</b> try to control, I control less. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> every time <b>I</b> try to color inside the lines that the color leaks out. <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> understanding begins by admitting I don‘t understand. In physics, the uncertainty principle embodies the resistance to precision. The art begins formalized, boundary-delimited and planar, and then begins to quickly escape and deform and seek other dimensions.“ ...|$|R

5|$|I {{realized}} the point I {{was trying to}} push with these two programmed robots was the desire for them to try {{and figure out what}} the point of living was... It took these really irrational acts of love to sort of discover them against how they were built... <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> that's a perfect metaphor for real life. We all fall into our habits, our routines and our ruts, consciously or unconsciously to avoid living. To avoid having to do the messy part. To avoid having relationships with other people or dealing with the person next to us. That's why we can all get on our cell phones and not have to deal with one another. I thought, 'That's a perfect amplification of {{the whole point of the}} movie.' I wanted to run with science in a way that would sort of logically project that.|$|E
5|$|On March 27, the Russians {{received}} {{word about the}} earlier disastrous defeat at Wschowa. Peter <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{the chances of a}} combined attack on Charles were now minimal. He ordered Ogilvy to attempt an escape from the encirclement at Grodno and a retreat towards Brest-Litovsk. Ogilvy carried out the order on April 4 and managed to break out unseen with his reduced army, leaving 8,000 men behind at Grodno who had died of starvation and sickness. Another 9,000 men were lost during the retreat as the Swedes pursued the Russians as far as Polesia, where they finally gave up the chase. Mazepa met a similar defeat, as he sent 4,700 men in an attempt to save the Cossacks trapped inside Lyakhavichy. Instead these were annihilated in the battle of Kletsk on April 30, after which the garrison in Lyakhavichy surrendered to the Swedes on May 12 and the fortress was destroyed. In total, almost 10,000 Cossacks were killed, out of the initial 14,000 who actively participated in the campaign.|$|E
25|$|I didn't write any {{songs in}} Henderson, {{but it was}} there <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> {{experiences}} I had had, things I had seen and heard could be set down {{in a kind of}} music characteristic of my race. There I learned to appreciate the music of my people … then the blues were born, because from that day on, I started thinking about putting my own experience down in that particular kind of music.|$|E

25|$|During a refueling, Spaatz was drenched {{with fuel}} when {{turbulence}} caused the hose {{to pull out}} of the receptacle. Recalling the event in 1975, Eaker said:We went over the Rose Bowl. It was very bumpy, as you can appreciate, as we should have appreciated, up against those mountains in January, and the refueling plane and the Question Mark were torn apart. I was piloting the Question Mark and <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> General Spaatz had probably been drenched in high octane gasoline.|$|E
25|$|When I asked {{a friend}} who worked for Fat where they think the leak came from, they pinpointed it to one {{specific}} person from a specific magazine (again, not AP) who had been begging them to hear the record. Upon hearing this person's name, <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> same person had been emailing and IMing me incessantly {{for the past few}} weeks about trying to write for AP...Once I found out the label was holding him responsible for the leak, I promptly wrote him and let him know that AP doesn't use writers who leak records, so I would not need his services.|$|E
25|$|She {{was very}} {{beautiful}} girl, all my girls are beautiful. I went to London {{with her in}} 1933. Bucky (Buckminster Fuller) and I were there the night before she did it. I remember very well she said, 'Well that's {{the end of the}} vodka. There isn't any more.' Just like that you know. I wouldn't have thought of it much, except afterward <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> that's what she was talking about. Dorothy was very pretty, and she traveled in this false world. She didn't want to be second to anybody, and she must have thought she was slipping.|$|E

25|$|The 29th had dawned calm, {{but while}} we were still trying to persuade {{ourselves}} that the tragedy was over and the volcano had exhausted its bowels, at about 8 o'clock, we heard a crash and then I noticed that smoke was rising {{from the point of}} the island that looks towards east. The smoke spread very gradually as far as the crater of the volcano, while there were many whiffs issuing from points in the direction of another headland. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the island had opened in these places and fearing that, if a crater should open below the water, an explosion might follow, much more formidable than the preceding ones, I mounted a horse and retired permanently to the Sanctuary of Caysasay.|$|E
25|$|After my father's {{appointment}} by {{his homeland}} as state {{official in the}} customs house of Bugia for the Pisan merchants who thronged to it, he took charge; and in view of its future usefulness and convenience, had me in my boyhood come to him and there wanted me to devote myself to and be instructed {{in the study of}} calculation for some days. There, following my introduction, as a consequence of marvelous instruction in the art, to the nine digits of the Hindus, the knowledge of the art very much appealed to me before all others, and for it <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> all its aspects were studied in Egypt, Syria, Greece, Sicily, and Provence, with their varying methods; and at these places thereafter, while on business. I pursued my study in depth and learned the give-and-take of disputation. But all this even, and the algorism, as well as the art of Pythagoras, I considered as almost a mistake in respect to the method of the Hindus (Modus Indorum). Therefore, embracing more stringently that method of the Hindus, and taking stricter pains in its study, while adding certain things from my own understanding and inserting also certain things from the niceties of Euclid's geometric art. I have striven to compose this book in its entirety as understandably as I could, dividing it into fifteen chapters. Almost everything which I have introduced I have displayed with exact proof, in order that those further seeking this knowledge, with its pre-eminent method, might be instructed, and further, in order that the Latin people might not be discovered to be without it, as they have been up to now. If I have perchance omitted anything more or less proper or necessary, I beg indulgence, since there is no one who is blameless and utterly provident in all things. The nine Indian figures are: 9 8 7 6 5 4 3 2 1. With these nine figures, and with the sign 0... any number may be written.|$|E

500|$|In an interview, Khaled Hosseini explains, [...] "I {{was searching}} for English {{translations}} of poems about Kabul, {{for use in a}} scene where a character bemoans leaving his beloved city, when I found this particular verse. <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> I had found not only the right line for the scene, but also an evocative title in the phrase 'a thousand splendid suns,' which appears in the next-to-last stanza." ...|$|E
500|$|... {{was like}} a trip down memory lane, looking back at {{everything}} I've accomplished {{and all the things}} I once valued {{and all the things that}} were important to me.

And <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> a lot of things that last and the things that matter are none of those things." ...|$|E
500|$|Jazz drummer Jimmy Chamberlin was {{recommended}} {{by a friend}} of Corgan's. Chamberlin knew little of alternative music and immediately changed {{the sound of the}} nascent band. As Corgan recalled of the period, [...] "We were completely into the sad-rock, Cure kind of thing. It took about two or three practices before <b>I</b> <b>realized</b> <b>that</b> the power in his playing was something that enabled us to rock harder than we could ever have imagined."

5000|$|The artist stated that....."I <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> {{behind my}} artistic creation, behind the fascination for the naked body, there are twenty centuries of painting, {{primarily}} religious, twenty centuries of dead Christs, tortured martyrs, gory revolutions, massacres and shattered dreams ... <b>I</b> <b>realize</b> <b>that</b> history and maybe art history are engraved {{on the body}} and flesh of men....." ...|$|R
