5000|$|Phytophthora cambivora is a plant {{pathogen}} that causes <b>Ink</b> <b>disease</b> in European Chestnut trees (Castanea sativa). <b>Ink</b> <b>disease,</b> also caused by Phytophthora cinnamomi, {{is thought to}} have been present in Europe since the 18th century and causes chestnut trees to wilt and die, major epidemics occurred during the 19th and 20th centuries. P. cinnamomi and P. cambivora are now present throughout Europe and since the 1990s <b>Ink</b> <b>disease</b> has resurged, often causing high mortality of trees, particularly in Portugal, Italy and France.

5000|$|The Phytophthora {{group is}} a paraphyletic genus that causes {{diseases}} such as dieback, late blight in potatoes (the cause of the Irish Potato Famine of the 1840s that ravaged Ireland {{and other parts of}} Europe), sudden oak death, rhododendron root rot, and <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> in the European chestnut ...|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} {{reported}} to be pathogenic on grandiflora petunia (Petunia × atkinsiana). It causes root rot, shoot rot and shanking in tulips. It also infects blue daze (Evolvulus glomeratus), dusty miller (Senecio cineraria), Barberton daisy (Gerbera jamesonii), and garden verbena (Verbena × hybrida). Like its relative Phytophtora cambivora, it can cause <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> of chestnuts (Castanea sativa).|$|E
50|$|In {{temperate}} regions {{this plant}} is either grown under glass or outdoors with the winter protection of a mulch. The species germinates readily from seed. As plants generally deteriorate {{after the second}} season, they are best treated as biennial. Watering should be withheld during the dormant period. They are susceptible to fungal <b>ink</b> spot <b>disease</b> and the leaves are attractive to snails. They are often used as cut flowers, due to their unique appearance and lasting qualities.|$|R
40|$|The phyllosphere {{supports}} {{a large and}} complex bacterial community that varies both across plant species and geographical locations. Phyllosphere bacteria can have important effects on plant health. The sweet chestnut (Castanea sativa Mill.) is an economically important tree species affected worldwide by the fungal pathogens Cryphonectria parasitica and Phytophthora cinnamomi. We examined the culturable phyllosphere bacterial community of the sweet chestnut at two nearby locations in Central Spain in order to know its geographical variability and to explore its potential as source of biological control agents against these two pathogenic fungi. The bacterial diversity at strain level was high but it varied significantly between locations; however, phylotype richness and diversity were more comparable. The isolates were affiliated with the phyla Actinobacteria, Firmicutes and Proteobacteria. Most of them were members of recognized bacterial species, with a notable proportion of representative of the genera Dietzia and Lonsdalea, but {{a small fraction of}} the strains revealed the existence of several potential novel species or even genera. Antagonism tests showed the occurrence in the chestnut phyllosphere of bacterial strains potentially useful as biological control agents against the two pathogenic fungi, some of which belong to species never before described as fungal antagonists. Chestnut phyllosphere, therefore, contains a great diversity of culturable bacteria and may represent an untapped source of potential biocontrol agents against the fungi causing blight and <b>ink</b> <b>diseases</b> of this tree species...|$|R

Amplification and mismatch detection (AMD) analysis of DNA from relatives of haemophilia B patients permitted carrier diagnosis by direct identification of {{the presence or absence}} of the mutation in all cases, thus eliminating the need for the informative segregation of polymorphic markers. This extends diagnostic capability to virtually all haemophilia B families. AMD analysis permits {{detection of}} all sequence variations in genomic DNA and is therefore applicable to direct diagnosis of X- 1 <b>inked</b> and autosomal <b>diseases</b> and for identification of new polymorphisms for genetic mapping...|$|R
5000|$|<b>Ink</b> <b>disease</b> {{also appears}} {{in a number of}} other plants. The disease attacks the phloem tissue and the cambium of the roots and root collars about 10-20 cm above ground. Wet rot settles in as a result. It was named after the ink-black color of the tannic acid {{becoming}} (oxidized) after seeping out, but that symptom is not a characteristic of only that disease. The same ink-black color can appear following other types of decays and mechanical injuries that make liquids seep through; these liquids can also oxidize after contact with air. Moreover, with some phytophthoric diseases, no tannic acid is generated. With the <b>ink</b> <b>disease,</b> the leaves turn yellow and later fall off; the fruits remain small, and the nuts prematurely drop out of the burrs. These dry and remain on the trees throughout winter. In acute cases, root decay makes the trees dry out and wither away. It is caused by Phytophthora cambivora and Phytophthora cinnamomi.|$|E
5000|$|Melanconis modonia can infect trees through {{injuries}} and induce [...] "bark death". It was first reported in Hungary by Hausz in 1972. The damage {{is of little}} consequence in older or stronger trees, but it affects sapling graftings in nurseries. Coryneum perniciosum, {{one of the two}} conidium-like side forms of this fungus, occurs on all decayed, ligneous parts of a chestnut tree. The symptoms of infection on young smooth trunks {{is similar to that of}} the chestnut blight fungus Cryphonectria. For this reason, it has persistently been wrongly thought of as the pathogen for <b>ink</b> <b>disease.</b> With Melanconis, the bark sinks in and takes on brownish-red tones, with black lentil-like multicell conidium bodies and black cone-like stromas breaking through the bark. But unlike with Cryphonectria, there are no orange-colored fruiting bodies. Prevention primarily includes keeping the tree in good shape; some further protections against Cryphonectria also help prevent bark death caused by Melanconis. *Chestnut mosaic virus is probably transmitted by the oak aphid Myzocallis castanicola.|$|E

Nine sweet chestnuts of comparable age, growing under same environmental and site conditions, and belonging to three phytosanitary classes (healthy, infected but asymptomatic and symptomatic) were randomly selected. Their ectomycorrhizal community was monitored during two periods, with regard to species abundance, to verify whether the community composition can be useful as an <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> bioindicator. From the 216 samples, 29 ectomycorrhizal species were recorded, with abundances that changed with the health status of the tree. The results demonstrated that the mycorrhizal community composition was highly related to the <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> level, allowing the consideration of the use of this parameter as a tool for the quick detection and control of {{the early stages of the}} disease...|$|E
30|$|A {{wide range}} of {{applications}} use ultraviolet (UV) lamps as a light source. These applications, such as chemical <b>ink</b> curing, <b>disease</b> or virus inspection, and air/water purification, traditionally adapt mercury-based lamps that are not environmentally friendly. To replace these mercury-based units, nitride-based UV light-emitting diodes (UV-LEDs) have recently received considerable attention because of their light-weight, high-efficiency, and eco-friendly features [1 - 4]. However, currently, the traditional nitride-based UV-LEDs cannot attain extremely high efficiency. Several improvements, such as AlInGaN barriers, high-temperature grown AlN buffers, pattern sapphire substrates, and current blocking layers, involving wafer epitaxy and layer designs have been proposed [5 - 10]. Apart from wafer design and quality problems, the sapphire-based UV-LEDs {{are influenced by the}} poor thermal dissipation of substrates and low light extraction efficiency [11 - 13]. Vertical injection LEDs (V-LEDs) have been recently demonstrated {{as one of the most}} promising technologies for achieving superior brightness operation because of their excellent thermal dissipation [14 - 20]. In addition to thermal problems, to strengthen the light extraction efficiency, the surfaces of the V-LEDs are abraded to enable extra scattering capability [21 - 26]. Furthermore, the current V-LED metal-contact design affords extra absorption because of layouts and materials. In this study, a novel layout design combined with innovative fabrication processes facilitated placing p and n contact metals on the same side of the main LED lighting area; this effectively eliminated the aforementioned electrode absorption loss and maintained the advantages of vertical bonding architecture. In the following sections, novel thin-GaN-based ultraviolet light-emitting diodes (NTG-LEDs) that include such designs and were created through advanced processing techniques (such as wafer bonding, laser lift-off (LLO), dry etching, textured surface, and interconnection processes) are described.|$|R
40|$|Background and Aims. Balloon-assisted {{enteroscopy}} (BAE) is {{a well-established}} {{tool in the}} diagnosis and therapy of small bowel <b>diseases.</b> <b>Ink</b> tattooing of the small bowel is used to mark pathologic lesions or the depth of small bowel insertion. The {{purpose of this study}} was to determine the safety, the detection rate, and the clinical relevance of ink tattooing during BAE. Methods. We performed a retrospective analysis of all 81 patients who received an ink tattooing during BAE between 2010 and 2015. Results. In all patients, ink tattooing was performed with no complications. 26 patients received a capsule endoscopy after BAE. The tattoo could be detected via capsule endoscopy in 19 of these 26 patients. The tattoo of the previous BAE could be detected via opposite BAE in 2 of 11 patients. In 9 patients, ink tattooing influenced the choice of approach for reenteroscopy. In 7 patients, the tattoo was used for intraoperative localization and in 3 patients for intraoperative localization as well as for reenteroscopy. The intraoperative detection rate of the tattoo was 100 %. Conclusion. Ink tattooing of the small intestine is a safe endoscopic procedure to mark the depth of scope insertion or a pathologic lesion during balloon-assisted enteroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Head {{and neck}} {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (HNSCC) show diverse clinicopathological features and are mostly linked with poor outcome. In this study, we tested if {{the expression of}} tumor growth, cell cycle and basement membrane anchorage related biomarkers allow prognostic and clinicopathological stratification of HNSCC. Archived HNSCC samples from 226 patients included into tissue microarrays (TMA) were tested using immunohistochemistry. Histopathological evaluation and the analysis of immunostaining for EGFR, Ki 67, p 53, p 16 ink 4 and Collagen XVII proteins were carried out in digital whole slides. Statistical evaluation was carried out using Pearson's Chi-square test and Kaplan-Meier survival analysis. In the tested cohort, hypopharyngeal cancers had the least favorable, and glottic cancers had the most favorable prognosis. High Ki 67 positive tumor cell fractions were associated with significantly worse prognosis and elevated rate of lymph node metastasis. Both Ki 67 and EGFR expression correlated significantly with the tumor localization. Ki 67 index was {{the highest in the}} hypopharyngeal region and it proved to be the lowest in the glottic region. EGFR expression was the highest in the oral cavity and the lowest in the glottic region. The survival rate of patients with p 16 ink 4 -negative cancer was significantly lower than of those with p 16 <b>ink</b> 4 -positive <b>disease.</b> A significant inverse correlation was found between histological grade and the prognosis of HNSCC. Our data support that elevated Ki 67 positive proliferating cell fractions contribute to the unfavorable prognosis of hypopharyngeal cancers, while glottic cancers have the most favorable prognosis because of the lowest Ki 67 expression rate...|$|R
40|$|In {{the past}} few decades, {{economic}} interest in the cultivation of chestnuts for both timber and nut production has resurfaced in the Mediterranean area. However, chestnut cultivation has suffered in recent years from the spread of exotic pests, such as the gall wasp Dryocosmus kuriphilus, and from the resurgence of previously present diseases, most likely due to anomalous climate dynamics. This {{is the case with}} chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease,</b> caused by the soilborne pathogens Phytophthora cinnamomi and P. cambivora. Scientific and technical support in monitoring and management, that utilizes new forecasting approaches incorporating related environmental variables, is therefore essential. The main aim {{of this study was to}} develop a mathematical model assessing the potential for the establishment of chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> at a large scale. Towards this goal, fuzzy rule-based theory was applied to the environmental variables associated with host presence, pathogens' ecological niches and <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> symptoms expression. The effectiveness of the rule-based modelling outcomes, provided with uncertainty maps to facilitate their correct interpretation, was confirmed by detailed field data collected from a large chestnut-growing area where <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> has been increasing in recent years. The final model gave consistent predictions for disease presence.

40|$|The Japanese {{chestnut}} (Castanea crenata) carries {{resistance to}} Phytophthora cinnamomi, the destructive and widespread oomycete causing <b>ink</b> <b>disease.</b> The European chestnut (Castanea sativa), carrying {{little to no}} disease resistance, is currently threatened {{by the presence of}} the oomycete pathogen in forests, orchards and nurseries. Determining the genetic basis of P. cinnamomi resistance, for further selection of molecular markers and candidate genes, is a prominent issue for implementation of marker assisted selection in the breeding programs for resistance. In this study, the first interspecific genetic linkage map of C. sativa x C. crenata allowed the detection of QTLs for P. cinnamomi resistance. The genetic map was constructed using two independent, control-cross mapping populations. Chestnut populations were genotyped using 452 microsatellite and single nucleotide polymorphism molecular markers derived from the available chestnut transcriptomes. The consensus genetic map spans 498, 9 cM and contains 217 markers mapped with an average interval of 2. 3 cM. For QTL analyses, the progression rate of P. cinnamomi lesions in excised shoots inoculated was used as the phenotypic metric. Using non-parametric and composite interval mapping approaches, two QTLs were identified for <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> resistance, distributed in two linkage groups: E and K. The presence of QTLs located in linkage group E regarding P. cinnamomi resistance is consistent with a previous preliminary study developed in American x Chinese chestnut populations, suggesting the presence of common P. cinnamomi defense mechanisms across species.

Most Phytophthora species secrete elicitins, a group of unique highly conserved proteins that are able to enhance plant defence responses in a systemic acquired resistance manner against infection by several pathogens. A cluster of four elicitin genes was identified in P. cinnamomi. In previous works one of these elicitins, α- cinnamomin was shown to restrict the invasion of root cortical tissues by P. cinnamomi preventing vascular colonization in cork and holm oak. In the present work, roots of chestnut plantlets grown in vitro were allowed to absorb α-cinnamomin at 100 μg/ml for two days before being inoculated with P. cinnamomi. The effects of this elicitin on host-pathogen interaction were studied at histological and ultrastructural levels. P. cinnamomi was restricted to the outer cortex of 65 % of the roots pre-treated with α-cinnamomin. In these roots, the vascular cylinders were free of pathogen. On the contrary, the pathogen reached the vascular cylinder, penetrating the phloem and xylem vessels in all non-treated assayed roots. The signs of pathogen degradation in the cortical parenchyma, mainly in the intercellular spaces, and the increase of a physical barrier in epidermal and sub-epidermal cell wall-media lamella and intercellular spaces by impregnation with phenol-like compounds strongly suggest that α-cinnamomin induced in chestnut defence reactions against P. cinnamomi...|$|E

40|$|Final {{version of}} the chapter at: [URL] the 1970 s, natural {{resources}} the world over have been progressively re-evaluated {{in accordance with the}} principles of sustainable agriculture. The European chestnut, Castanea sativa Mill., a hardwood species belonging to the family Fagaceae, has not been unaffected by this process. It is an important resource {{in many parts of the}} world because of its economic and environmental role in many agroforestry systems, and in Europe it has been gaining in value as a source of timber and nut production and due to the contribution of chestnut groves to the landscape (Bounous, 2005). Like the American chestnut C. dentata, C. sativa has been plagued for more than a century by <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> and chestnut blight, caused by the fungi Phytophthora cinnamomi and Cryphonectria parasitica, respectively. A great deal of research on chestnut focuses on the development of vegetative propagation systems capable of satisfying the demand for elite genotypes that provide both high-quality timber and/or nuts and resistance to these diseases. Since chestnut is a difficult-to-root species, grafting is the most frequent conventional propagation technique, although methods for layering and cutting have recently been improved and are widely used in nurseries to propagate ink-disease-resistant Euro-Japanese hybrids. However, as an alternative to conventional vegetative propagation methods, efforts are being made to establish reliable in vitro regeneration systems that allow clonal propagation. The two major systems are based on embryogenesis or on micropropagation of axillary shoots.

The aim {{of this study was to}} examine which forest Phytophthora species are present in southern Sweden. Symptomatic trees were identified in five urban forest settings in Southern Skåne. Stem tissue and soil surrounding symptomatic trees were collected. Phytophthora isolates were cultured on artificial media and their DNA sequenced by sanger-­sequencing. The obtained sequences were compared with the known reference sequences using the basic local alignment search tool (BLAST) at NCBI. Five Phytophthora species were identified: P. cactorum, P. cambivora, P. gonapodyides, P. plurivora and P. syringae. The result includes the first findings of P. gonapodyides causing stem lesions on trees in Sweden. Confirmation of pathogenicity of P. gonapodyides in an inoculation trial using obtained P. gonapodyides isolates confirmed that they were able to infect healthy beech seedlings, resulting in stem lesions. Many common tree species in Southern Sweden are susceptible to the Phytophthora species found in this study. Trade with nursery seedlings is an important pathway of dispersal and establishment of Phytophthoras in natural environments. There is no efficient treatment and it is practically impossible to eradicate Phytophthora once it has become established in a site. If the identified Phytophthora species become widely established in Sweden, they may cause severe damages to forest ecosystems as well as for the Swedish forestry sector...|$|E
40|$|The most {{important}} oomycete forest pathogens comprise two genera: Pythium and the formidable genus Phytophthora, whose name appropriately means 'plant destroyer'. Pythium spp. cause seed and root rots and damping off diseases that thwart seedling establishment, {{and have been}} implicated in helping to drive forest diversity patterns through increased disease pressures on seedlings closest to their mother tree (Janzen, 1970; Connell, 1971). In contrast, Phytophthora spp. can cause disease at every life stage of forest trees, from root to crown, and from trunk cankers to foliar blights (Erwin and Ribeiro, 1996). They are remarkably flexible and effective pathogens with an unusual genetic architecture that may favour the rapid evolution of pathogenicity (Jiang et al., 2008; Raffaele et al., 2010; Seidl et al., 2011). Outbreaks of disease caused by Phytophthora spp. (especially when they have been introduced to new systems) have been documented with dramatic, and sometimes disastrous, effects since the mid 1800 s, when European and North American chestnuts (Castanea spp.) began dramatic declines from chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease,</b> a root rot caused {{in part by the}} extreme generalist Phytophthora cinnamomi Rands (Crandall et al., 1945; Anagnostakis, 1995). P. cinnamomi is notorious for the massive mortality it has caused in jarrah (Eucalyptus marginata Donn ex Sm.) forests in Western Australia, where it was first observed in the 1920 s (Podger, 1972). P. cinnamomi causes root disease in agricultural and forest systems worldwide with varying degrees of virulence, but as Phytophthora dieback it has been seen to kill 50 - 75 % of the species in sites in Western Australia, in some cases leaving every tree and much of the understorey dead (Weste, 2003). Shearer et al. (2004) estimate that of the 5710 described plant species in the South West Botanical Province of Western Australia, approximately 2300 species are susceptible, 800 of which are highly susceptible...|$|E
40|$|Sequence {{characterized}} amplified region (SCAR) markers {{are one of}} {{the most}} effective and accurate tools for microbial identification. In this study, we applied SCAR markers for the rapid and accurate detection of Phytophthora katsurae, the casual agent of chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> in Korea. In this study, we developed seven SCAR markers specific to P. katsurae using random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD), and assessed the potential of the SCAR markers to serve as tools for identifying P. katsurae. Seven primer pairs (SOPC 1 F/SOPC 1 R, SOPC 1 - 1 F/SOPC 1 - 1 R, SOPC 3 F/SOPC 3 R, SOPC 4 F/SOPC 4 R, SOPC 4 F/SOPC 4 - 1 R, SOPD 9 F/SOPD 9 R, and SOPD 10 F/SOPD 10 R) from a sequence derived from RAPD fragments were designed for the analysis of the SCAR markers. To evaluate the specificity and sensitivity of the SCAR markers, the genomic DNA of P. katsurae was serially diluted 10 -fold to final concentrations from 1 mg/mL to 1 pg/mL. The limit of detection using the SCAR markers ranged from 100 μg/mL to 100 ng/mL. To identify the limit for detecting P. katsurae zoospores, each suspension of zoospores was serially diluted 10 -fold to final concentrations from 10 × 105 to 10 × 101 zoospores/mL, and then extracted. The limit of detection by SCAR markers was approximately 10 × 101 zoospores/mL. PCR detection with SCAR markers was specific for P. katsurae, and did not produce any P. katsurae-specific PCR amplicons from 16 other Phytophthora species used as controls. This study shows that SCAR markers are a useful tool for the rapid and effective detection of P. katsurae.

40|$|Phytophthora cinnamomi is a soil-borne {{pathogen}} {{that causes}} crown and root rot of many horticultural, ornamental and forestry crops. It preferentially attacks 'feeder' roots. The geographical origin of P. cinnamomi is not clearly established. It was first described on Cinnamonum burmannii (Lauraceae) in Sumatra (ID) in 1922, but {{now has a}} nearly worldwide distribution, including most of Europe (CABI. 1991). The pathogen is found in tropical and subtropical countries and in the Mediterranean and some mild, temperate regions where it has almost certainly been introduced (EPPO/CABI, l 998). P. cinnamomi is the most widely distributed Phytophthora species, with over 1000 host species (Zentmeyer, 1983). The most significant food-crop losses due to P. cinnamomi root rot occur in avocado but the pathogen also attacks Ananas comosus, Castanea dentata and C. sativa, Cinchona spp., Chamaecyparis lawsoniana, Cinnamomum spp., conifers, Ericaceae (including Rhododendron spp.), Eucalyptus spp., especially E. marginata. Fagus spp., Juglans spp., Pinus spp., Prunus spp., Quercus spp. and many ornamental trees and shrubs, including Vaccinium macrocarpon. It has caused extensive damage to natural Eucalyptus Forest in Western Australia. The recorded host range includes most of the temperate fruit trees, {{but these are not}} relevant hosts in practice. In the EPPO region, the most significant hosts are nursery stock of ornamental and amenity trees and avocados, in the limited areas where they are grown. It has been reported to be the main causal agent of <b>ink</b> <b>disease</b> of C. sativa in southern France and has been indicated as a possible causal agent of oak decline in the Iberian Peninsula. Propagules are spread by soil movement, including wind-blow or debris, or by water flow and run-off in drainage/irrigation ditches. Control is complicated by the very wide host range {{as well as by the}} longevity (often many years) of propagules (mainly sporangia and encysted zoospores) in nonsterile moist soil and root debris at depths at which soil fumigation is not always effective (Munnecke, 1984). Symptomless plants are a major means of spreading the pathogen to disease-free areas and this is the main problem for intensive production systems in the nursery industry. The first line of control is therefore planting disease-free stock. Imported plants for planting should be kept well separated in nurseries and preferably grown in containers for several months until their phytosanitary status has been checked. Strict hygiene should be observed at all times...|$|E
40|$|Main goal {{of forest}} diseases’ {{management}} {{is to reduce}} economic, biological and aesthetic damages and biodiversity loss caused by plant parasites. The many strategies used can be grouped under two main actions, prevention (prophylaxis in some early writings) and therapy (treatment or cure). Prevention is limited primarily {{by the lack of}} knowledge of the organisms involved, including host plants. Mathematical models have been used to extend the understanding of plant disease epidemiology on a number of fronts, providing an opportunity for a more rational use of resources on expensive field trials and representing a step towards more sustainable control measures. From a curative point of view, current efforts by scientists have focused on developing diseases management (Pest Management = PM) concepts in order to balance the benefits of pesticides with the ecological concerns of their residues contaminating the environment. In this thesis, the two PM principles were applied from an innovative point of view on two case studies: ash dieback caused by Hymenoscyphus fraxineus, which can be considered the most serious disease for Fraxinus genus in Europe, and chestnut <b>ink</b> <b>disease,</b> caused by Phytophthora cambivora and P. cinnamomi. In {{the first part of the}} thesis, the two diseases are introduced, in order to permit the evaluation of similarities and differences (chapter I). Subsequently, from chapter II to chapter V, the experimental trials performed are described. In particular, in chapter II a study of the ecological niche of H. fraxineus, with the characterization of the environmental variables associated with naturally infected zones, is reported. This procedure was realized with Species Distribution Models (SDM), widely utilized in the ecological field and only recently applied to plant pathology. The presence of the pathogen was highly correlated to three summer predictors: abundant precipitation, high soil moisture and low air temperature, in comparison with the averages of the study area. The ensemble forecasting technique was then applied to obtain a prediction of the potential distribution of the pathogen at European scale, considering the distribution maps of Fraxinus excelsior and Fraxinus angustifolia, susceptible to the parasite. At last, an innovative method of network analysis permitted to identify the suitable areas that are not reachable by the pathogen with a natural spread. Chapter III reports a study conducted to evaluate six fungicides for their potential to control ash dieback. Initially, in vitro tests of the active ingredients against five different strains of the pathogen indicated thiabendazole, propiconazole and allicin as the most effective fungicides, with lower median lethal doses than procloraz. In contrast, copper sulphate and potassium phosphite were totally ineffective. Subsequently, the antifungal activities of the best three compounds were investigated in planta against H. fraxineus by trunk injection on European ashes inoculated with an indigenous strain. The test was preceded by preliminary trials to maximize the efficacy of injections; in the experimental conditions highest speed was reached with the addition of 1. 2...|$|E
