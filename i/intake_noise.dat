The 2.3-liter Accord 4-cylinder engine intake manifold has been redesigned to add more power and lower emissions. The individual cast-aluminum runners have revised dimensions to better take advantage of the different air-flow characteristics of the 2.3-liter engine. A larger plenum chamber reduces induction noise and the incorporation of Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) ports into the plenum, upstream of the throttle plates, eliminates the need for a separate fitting and port in each intake runner.|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} work, a {{downsized}} VVA Spark Ignition engine is numerically and experimentally studied. In particular, the following topics are considered: •In-cylinder turbulence and combustion processes; •Knock and cycle by cycle variation (CCV) phenomena; •Techniques aiming to mitigate knock occurrence and improve fuel economy such as EGR and water injection methods; •Intake system redesign {{to reduce the}} emitted gas-dynamic noise; •Engine calibration. A deep experimental campaign is carried out to characterize the engine behaviour. Indeed, engine system is investigated {{both in terms of}} the overall performance (torque, power, fuel consumption, air flow rate, boost pressure etc.) and of the <b>intake</b> gas-dynamic <b>noise</b> at full load operation. In addition, proper experimental analyses are peformed on the engine to characterize the CCV phenomenon and the knock occurrence. Measured data are post-processed to derive experimental parameters which syntetize CCV and knock levels, according to the engine operating conditions. A 1 D CFD model of the whole engine is realized in GT-PowerTM environment. Refined “in-house developed” sub-models capable to reproduce turbulence, combustion, CCVs and knock processes are introduced into 1 D code through user routines. First of all, the whole engine model is validated against the experimental data both in terms of overall performance parameters and ensemble averaged pressure cycles and <b>intake</b> gas-dynamic <b>noise</b> at part and full load operation. Cycle by cycle variation is reproduced through a proper correlation and consequently a representative faster than average in-cylinder pressure cycle is obtained. Then, the knock model, with reference to the latter pressure cycle, allows to evaluate a proper knock index and to identify the knock limited spark advance (KLSA), basing on the same threshold level adopted in experimental knock analysis. In this way, the knock model taking into account the CCV is validated at full load operation. Once validated, the original engine architecture is modified by virtually installing a “Low pressure” EGR system. 1 D simulations accounting for various EGR rates and mixture leaning are performed at full load points, showing improvements in the fuel economy with the same knock intensity of the base engine configuration. Water injection technique is also investigated by virtually mounting a water injector in the intake runners for each engine cylinder. In a similar way, 1 D analyses are carried out for various water/fuel and air-to-fuel ratios, highlightinig BSFC improvements at full load operation. Since the engine under study is characterized by higher <b>intake</b> gas-dynamic <b>noise</b> levels, a partial redesign of the intake system is properly identified and subsequently tested with 1 D and 3 D CFD simulations to numerically quantify the gains in terms of reduction in the gas-dynamic noise emitted at the intake mouth. Finally, a numerical methodology aiming to calibrate the considered engine at high load knock-limited and at part load operations is developed. First, it shows the capability to identify with satisfactory accuracy the experimentally advised engine calibration. In addition, it allows the comparison of different intake valve strategies, underlining, in certain engine operating conditions, the fuel consumption benefits of an early intake valve closure (EIVC) strategy with respect to a Full Lift one, due to a better combustion phasing and a reduced mixture over-fuelling. The developed automatic procedure presents the capability to realize a “virtual” engine calibration on completely theoretical basis and proves to be very helpful in reducing time and costs related to experimental activities at the test bench...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Automotive engine {{manufacturers}} are focusing increasingly {{their attention on}} noise generated by air intake systems. In particular {{in recent years the}} increased usage of plastics for air intake manifold (AIM) production, in place of metallic materials, made the NVH optimization more complicated. In this framework, it is very important not only the minimization of the noise generated via fluid propagation (orifice-noise from inlets) but also of the noise radiated via the coupled fluid-structure interaction. In this work acoustical performance of an AIM prototype has been experimentally and numerically investigated. From the experimental point of view, the acoustic analysis was performed by means of acoustic intensity measurements around the body. In order to minimize the noise contribution from all the other sources of an operating engine, the AIM was assembled on an engine head which was mounted on a dynamic flow test bench, where the intake valve-train was driven by an electrical motor. The <b>intake</b> orifice <b>noise</b> was differently treated, both leaving the orifice open and employing a dissipative muffler. Simulations through a coupled fluid-structure approach were performed. The normal modes of the structure were previously calculated on a fully-detailed FEM model and checked through accelerometric data; material properties could then be properly chosen. Measured data of the pressure pulsations at the inlet valves was used as excitation and applied to a coarsened acoustic Indirect-BEM model of the AIM coupled with a structural FEM one. Tuning of experimental and numerical acoustic data was useful for defining a practical analysis procedure for NVH design of plastic AIMs. 1...|$|R
40|$|The fluid dynamic {{processes}} occurring inside {{intake and}} exhaust systems of I. C. engines {{are one of the}} main noise sources in land transport vehicles. Therefore, it is considered by vehicle manufacturers as one of the factors determining the feasibility of a certain vehicle design. The generalized trend in achieving higher and higher levels of engine performances, together with social environmental concerns pushing for the introduction of increasingly severe restrictions to pollutant emissions, have led to the inclusion of different devices in the {{intake and exhaust}} systems, whose primary functions are related to emission abatement and performance enhancement (turbochargers, intercoolers and after-treatment devices). Therefore, the acoustic design of intake and exhaust systems has been affected, since these devices have a direct influence on the internal wave dynamics, and thus on <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>noise.</b> To predict the acoustic impact of an engine equipped with these devices it becomes mandatory the adoption of simplified non linear tools. In particular non linear 1 D and quasi- 3 D approaches can be exploited to determine the acoustic performance of devices which are usually subject to mean flow and and high amplitude pressure perturbation along with discontinuities in the temperature field...|$|R
40|$|Unlike exhaust noise, {{the intake}} system noise off an {{automobile}} cannot be measured {{because of the}} proximity of the engine at the point-of measurement. Besides, the intake side is associated with turbocharger (booster),intercooler, cooling fan, etc., which will make the measurement of the <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> erroneous. Therefore, in the present investigation, the source characteristics of the intake system have been expressed as functions of the engine's physical, operating and thermodynamic parameters. The pressure time history is first computed by means of the commercial software AVL-BOOST for different acoustic loads (induction pipe lengths), which are then used to determine source characteristics, Le.,p(s) and Z(S) (analogous to the open-circuit voltage and internal impedance of an electrical source), using an appropriate multi-load method. This investigation has been conducted for both naturally aspirated and turbocharged diesel engine. Using this methodology and the resultant empirical relations, one can analyze any compression-ignition (CI) engine configuration for the prediction of the un-muffled noise without having to carry out the rather cumbersome and time-consuming time-domain simulation of the intake side. The aim of the present study is to parameterize the source characteristics of an engine in terms of basic engine parameters, so that a first assessment of the un-muffled <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> can be made by means of the frequency-domain transfer matrix method before a detailed design is taken up...|$|E
30|$|<b>Intake</b> <b>noise</b> control {{begins with}} the air intake system design, the {{structure}} of the valve, cam curve shape, and many other factors, while at the same time, noise control is restrained by power performance and economic efficiency (Boutin and Becot 2015). At present, the actual application of active noise control technology remains in its infancy (Zhou et al. 2009). Therefore, passive noise control is currently the most commonly applied method in the <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> control, and its core principle is based in muffler design. Mofakhami et al. (2008) studied sound transmission through multilayered viscoelastic air filled cylinders. His result showed that using constant and frequency-dependent viscoelastic material, with high loss factor, leads to uniform noise reduction in the frequency domain. Miandoab et al. (2015) analyzed the nonlinear dynamics and chaotic behavior of nanoresonators with electrostatic forces on both sides, which indicated that the necessary condition for the creation of chaos in the resonator is intersection of the system steady state response with the homoclinic orbit. Ning et al. (2015) used a quasi-one-dimensional model based on the compressible Navier–Stokes equations and a finite volume method to investigate the transient motion of a fluid inside oscillating axisymmetric tubes. Li (2010) developed an objective function to optimize parameters (number and location) of resonator-like cavities, which is based on the tuned weighting coefficient and the acoustic potential energy. Unnikrishnan et al. (2010) presents a simplified modeling approach for numerical simulation of a coupled cavity-resonator system, which was validated by experimentation. It is shown that the resonator volume fraction required to significantly (more than 5  dB) suppress the cavity axial mode. Otherwise, the PZT piezoelectric plates (Li et al. 2013 a) and multiple PVDF beam arrays (Li et al. 2013 b) are used {{in the design of the}} muffler to achieve the purpose of energy collection and recycling.|$|E
40|$|For {{an engine}} running at a {{constant}} speed, both exhaust and intake processes are periodic in nature. This inspires the muffler designer {{to go for the}} much easier and faster frequency domain modeling. But analogous to electrical filter, as per Thevenin’s theorem, the acoustic filter or muffler requires prior knowledge of the load-independent source characteristics (acoustic pressure and internal impedance), corresponding to the open circuit voltage and internal impedance of an electrical source. Studies have shown that it is not feasible to evaluate these source characteristics making use of either the direct measurement method or the indirect evaluation method. Hence, prediction of the radiated exhaust or <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> has been subject to trial and error. Making use of the fact that pressure perturbation in a duct is a superposition of the forward moving wave and the reflected wave, a simple hybrid approach has been proposed making use of an interrelationship between progressive wave variables of the linear acoustic theory and Riemann variables of the method of characteristics. Neglecting the effect of nonlinearities, reflection of the forward moving wave has been duly incorporated at the exhaust valve. The reflection co-efficient of the system downstream of the exhaust valve has been calculated by means of the transfer matrix method at each of the several harmonics of the engine firing frequency. This simplified approach can predict exhaust noise with or without muffler for a naturally aspirated, single cylinder engine. However, this proves to be inadequate in predicting the exhaust noise of multi-cylinder engines. Thus, estimation of radiated noise has met only limited success in this approach. Strictly speaking, unique source characteristics do not exist for an IC engine because of the associated non-linearity of the time-varying source. Yet, a designer would like to know the un-muffled noise level in order to assess the required insertion loss of a suitable muffler. As far as the analysis and design of a muffler is concerned, the linear frequency-domain analysis by means of the transfer matrix approach is most convenient and time saving. Therefore, from a practical point of view, it is very desirable to be able to evaluate source characteristics, even if grossly approximate. If somehow it were possible to parameterize the source characteristics of an engine in terms of basic engine parameters, then {{it would be possible to}} evaluate the un-muffled noise before a design is taken up as a first approximation. This aspect has been investigated in detail in this work. A finite-volume CFD (one dimensional) model has been used in conjunction with the two-load or multi-load method to evaluate the source characteristics at a point just downstream of the exhaust manifold for the exhaust system, and upstream of the air filter (dirty side) in the case of the intake system. These source characteristics have been extracted from the pressure time history calculated at that point using the electro-acoustic analogy. Systematic parametric studies have yielded approximate empirical expressions for the source characteristics of an engine in terms of the basic engine parameters like engine RPM, capacity (swept volume or displacement), air-fuel ratio, and the number of cylinders. The effect of other parameters has been found to be relatively insignificant. Unlike exhaust noise, the intake system noise of an automobile cannot be measured because of the proximity of the engine at the point of measurement. Besides, the intake side is associated with turbocharger (booster), intercooler, cooling fan, etc., which will make the measurement of the <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> erroneous. From the noise radiation point of view, <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> used to be considered to be a minor source of noise as compared to the exhaust noise. Therefore, very little has been done or reported on prediction of the <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> as compared to the exhaust noise. But nowadays, with efficient exhaust mufflers, the un-muffled <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> has become a contributing factor to the passenger compartment noise level as a luxury decisive factor. Therefore, in this investigation both the intake and the exhaust side source characteristics have been found out for the compression ignition as well as the spark ignition engines. Besides, in the case of compression ignition engines, typical turbocharged as well as naturally aspirated engines have been considered. One of the inputs to the time-domain simulation is the intake valve and exhaust valve lift histories as functions of crank angle. It is very cumbersome and time-consuming to measure and feed these data into the program. Sometimes, this data is not available or cannot be determined easily. So, a generalized formula for the valve lift has been developed by observing the valve lift curves of various engines. The maximum exhaust valve lift has been expressed as a function of the swept volume of the cylinder. This formulation is not intended for designing a cam profile; it is for the purpose of determining approximate thermodynamic quantities to help a muffler designer for an initial estimation. It has also been observed during the investigation that from the acoustic point of view, sometimes it is better to open the exhaust valve a little earlier, but very slowly and smoothly, and keep it open for a longer time. Although the exact source characteristics for an automobile engine cannot be determined precisely, yet the values of source characteristics calculated using this methodology have been shown to be reasonably good for approximate prediction of the un-muffled noise as well as insertion loss of a given muffler. The resultant empirical expressions for the source characteristics enable the potential user to make use of the frequency-domain cum-transfer matrix approach throughout; the time consuming time-domain simulation of the engine exhaust source is no longer necessary. Predictions of the un-muffled sound pressure level of automotive engines have been corroborated against measured values as the well as the full scale time-domain predictions making use of a finite-volume software...|$|E

The lubricant pressure, engine noise and mass air flow changes were recorded under a steady state operating condition with an increased engine speed in which both the volume and temperature of the lubricant remained unchanged for each sets of test. The engine was driven by an electric motor at a wide-open throttle and a constant speed ranging from 500 to 3000 rpm with 500 rpm increment. The lubricant and cooling water were set at 32 °C (unheated) and 90 °C (heated) for each run. In general, {{the pressure of the}} lubricant was found to decrease for either increased engine speed or lubricant temperature. It was found that high lubricant viscosity produced high overall engine friction and resulted to a higher engine noise. Heated lubricant started off with a very low pressure with 0. 996 bar compared to unheated lubricant with 2. 497 bar in 500 rpm. Unheated engine lubricant recorded a peak noise of 107. 2 dB at 1500 rpm before it dropped momentarily before increased linearly beyond this speed.

40|$|International audienceThe {{air intake}} systems of {{internal}} combustion engines are comprised of ducts and air boxes (e. g. air cleaner).

Such a solution has an important drawbacks: (1) Dust can fill the pores, leading to loss of effectiveness; (2) The acoustic power radiated along the duct increases. The last issue is addressed here with measurements: the acoustic power radiated along the duct is compared to the acoustic power radiated by the nozzle, in different conditions (with or without porosity, homogeneous or discrete porosity, various airflow velocities).

Four high order finite element methods are used to solve the convected wave equation, and their performances are compared. The benefit of using the hierarchic Lobatto finite element method to solve this type of problem is demonstrated. A scheme which optimises the efficiency of the high order method is developed.

Breakthroughs have been achieved in the prediction and control of breakout noise from the elliptical and circular muffler shell as well as the end plates of typical mufflers. Diesel particulate filters and inlet air cleaners have also been modeled acoustically. Some of these recent advances are the subject of this review paper...|$|R

Mental performance and visual attention were measured by Trail-Making Test (TMT) and Colour-Word-Test (CWT) before/after an acute stress stimulus (noise, CW-Interference). TMT improved upon product intake. The CWT reaction time accelerated upon product intake in situations of CW-Congruence (overall) (p= 0. 014), CW-conflict (overall) (p= 0. 024), CW-conflict (with noise) (p= 0. 001), CW-Congruence (without noise) (p= 0. 004) and CW-conflict (without noise) (p= 0. 017). CWT-changes upon product <b>intake,</b> differentiated for <b>noise</b> and CW-interference, showed (i) a bisection of CW-interference-related impairment of the reaction time {{in the presence of}} noise from 27 ms to 13. 5 ms, (ii) a bisection of noise-related impairment of the reaction time in the presence of CW-conflict from 34 ms to 17 ms, (iii) an improvement of the impairment of the reaction time due to combined stress (noise plus CW-conflict) by 14. 5 ms from 66 ms to 51. 5 ms, (iv) despite of the improvement of the reaction time, no increase of the error rate. Safety blood parameters and the reporting of no adverse events argue for the product’s safety. These results may be relevant for persons solving cognitive tasks under conflict and/or noise (e. g. open-plan offices or car-driving) andsupport that the tested product alleviatesstress-induced impairment of executive functioning (working memory, cognitive flexibility, controlled behavioural inhibition) ...|$|R
40|$|Traffic is a {{major source}} of {{environmental}} noise in modern day's society. As a result, the development of new vehicles are subject to heavy governmental legislations. The major noise sources on common road vehicles are engine noise, transmission noise, tire noise and, at high speeds, wind noise. One way to reduce <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>noise</b> is to attach mufflers to the exhaust pipes. However, to develop prototypes for the evaluation of muffler performance is a costly and time-consuming process. As a consequence, in recent years so called virtual prototyping has emerged as an alternative. Current industrial simulation methodologies are often rather crude, normally only including one-dimensional mean flows and one-dimensional acoustic fields. Also, flow generated noise is rudimentary modeled or not included at all. Hence, improved methods are needed to fully benefit from the possibilities of virtual prototyping. This thesis is aimed at the development of simulation methodologies suitable both as industrial tools for the prediction of the acoustic performance of flow duct systems, as well as for analyzing the governing mechanisms of duct aeroacoustics. Special focus has been at investigating the possibilities to use frequency-domain linearized Navier-Stokes equations solvers, where the equations are solved either directly or as eigenvalue formulations. A frequency-domain linearized Navier-Stokes equations methodology has been developed to simulate sound propagation and acoustic scattering in flow duct systems. The performance of the method has been validated to experimental data and analytical solutions for several cases of in-duct area expansions and orifice plates at different flow speeds. Good agreement has generally been found, suggesting that the proposed methodology is suitable for analyzing internal aeroacoustics. QC 2011051...|$|R
40|$|Shorter product {{development}} cycles, densely packed engine compartments and intensified noiselegislation increase {{the need for}} accurate predictions of IC-engine air <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> at earlystages. The urgent focus on the increasing CO 2 emissions and the efficiency of IC-engines, aswell as new techniques such as homogeneous charge compression ignition (HCCI) mightworsen the noise situation. Nonlinear one-dimensional (1 D) gas dynamics time-domainsimulation software packages are used within the automotive industry to predict intake andexhaust orifice noise. The inherent limitation of 1 D plane wave propagation, however, limitsthis technique to sufficiently low frequencies where non-plane wave effects are small. Thereforethis type of method will first fail in large components such as air cleaners. Further limitations,that might not be important for simulation of engine performance but indeed for acoustics,include difficulties to apply frequency dependent boundary conditions and losses as well as toinclude effects of vibrating walls. The {{first part of this}} thesis treats two different strategies to combine nonlinear and linearmodelling of intake systems in order to improve the accuracy of the noise predictions. Paper Adescribes how a linear time-invariant one-port source model can be extracted using nonlineargas dynamics simulations. Predicted source data for a six-cylinder naturally aspirated engine isvalidated using experimental data obtained from engine test bench measurements. Paper Bpresents an experimental investigation on the influence of mean flow and filter paper on theacoustics of air intake systems. It also suggests how a linear source, extracted from nonlinearsimulations can be coupled to acoustic finite elements describing the intake system and toboundary elements describing the radiation to the surroundings. Simulations and measurementsare carried out for a large number of engine revolution speeds {{in order to make the}} firstsystematic validation of an entirely virtual <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> model that includes 3 D effects for awide engine speed range. In Paper C an initial study on a new technique for the use of two-portsin the time domain for automotive gas dynamics applications is presented. Tabulated frequencydomaintwo-port data representing an air cleaner unit on the impedance form is inverselytransformed to the time domain and used as FIR filters in nonlinear time-domain calculations. The second part of the thesis considers detailed modelling of sound propagation in capillarytubes. Thermoviscous boundary effects and interaction between sound waves and turbulencecan, for sufficiently narrow tubes, yield significant attenuation. Several components in the gasexchange system of IC-engines are based on arrays of narrow ducts and might haveunderestimated silencing capabilities. In particular the sound transmission properties of chargeair coolers (CAC) have so far gained interest from very few authors. In Paper D a detailedinvestigation of the acoustic properties of CACs is presented. As a result the first linearfrequency-domain model for CACs, which includes a complete treatment of losses in the narrowtubes and 3 D effects in the connecting tanks, is proposed. Interesting low frequency dampingmost likely due to interaction between sound and turbulence is observed in the experimentaldata. A new numerical model that describes this dissipative effect in narrow tubes is suggestedin Paper E. Validation is carried out using experimental data from the literature. Finally, inPaper F the CAC-model presented in Paper D is updated with the new model for interactionbetween turbulence and acoustic waves proposed in Paper E. The updated model is shown toyield improved predictions. QC 2010072...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Turbochargers {{have become}} common in {{passenger}} cars {{as well as}} commercial vehicles. They have an excellent mechanism to effectively increase fuel efficiency and engine power, but they unfortunately cause several noise problems. Its noise are mainly classified as structure-borne noises, generated from the vibration of rotating shaft modules (cartridges), and air-borne noises, from air flow inside turbochargers or their coupling ducts. In this study an attempt to reduce the pulsation noise generated from the compressor wheels, whose frequency {{is the same as}} the whine noise is presented. This attempt is based on using the compact high frequency side branch resonators to develop low <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> system. The design of such system, which is mainly based on the developed 1 D linear acoustic theory and theoretical investigations to use more than one resonator connected to the main duct in series and/or in parallel are introduced. An optimization strategy to choose the appropriate resonator axis offset is presented. In case of complex unsymmetrical geometry in real resonators, a 3 D finite element is used. The presented models are validated via comparison with the measured results at room temperatures. The validated models are used to improve the acoustic performance of the real resonators. Based on the developed models and the optimization results, the internal design of resonators improves its acoustic performance; the serial arrangements increase the damping at the same peak frequency while the parallel arrangements make it wider. The amount of extra damping added to the intake system depends on the resonators geometry and their axis offset which can be around 50 dB a...|$|E
40|$|The {{research}} {{presented in}} this thesis explores the prediction of noise propagation and radiation in turbofan engine intakes and bypass ducts, and the optimisation of noise attenuation by using acoustic liners. A commercial FE/IE code ACTRAN/TM is used within two shell programs; B-induct for bypass ducts and ANPRORAD for intake ducts. An automated liner impedance capability has been demonstrated by exploiting an optimisation suite, SOFT. Automated liner impedance optimisations to maximise the liner insertion loss have been performed for a uniform bypass duct with a multimodal noise source, by using B-induct within SOFT. Results show that, multi-segment liners are effective at low frequencies when few acoustic duct modes are present and less so at high frequencies when many modes are present. Other results show that, at high frequencies, having different liner impedances on {{the inner and outer}} walls could be more effective than axially segment liners. An automated liner impedance optimisation has also been performed for a realistic bypass duct, and an A-weighting has been considered. Far field noise levels predicted by using ANPRORAD analysis have been validated against measured data from rig and engine tests. The predicted results are in good agreement with the measured data when the noise source is calibrated using in-duct measured values. This demonstrates that ANPRORAD is a viable methodology for <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> predictions in industry. ANPRORAD has also been applied to investigate the effect of the intake geometry on low-frequency acoustic reflections in the intake, and integrated within SOFT to perform automated liner impedance optimisations to minimise acoustic reflections to the fan.

Turbocharging {{is used as a}} means to downsize petrol engines, thereby, producing more power for a lower engine size, when compared with a naturally aspirated engine. Due to the presence of a throttle valve in the intake system in petrol engines, flow is restricted at the outlet pipe of the compressor during low load engine operation. For example, during transient tip out tip in maneuvers. Hence, there is a chance of the turbocharger operating in near surge or surge conditions and, thus, generating surge noise. This Thesis describes an experimental and simulation method to predict and measure the turbocharger surge noise. Initially, experimental transient tip-in and tip-out maneuver was performed on a non turbocharged car with a petrol engine. The measured noise level in the intake manifold, at a low frequency of up to 1200 Hz, was analysed and was shown not to represent surge noise. Next, a one dimensional simulation method was applied to simulate the noise of the engine and this demonstrated an increase in the acoustic pressure level in the intake manifold during the tip in and tip out maneuver. However, a surge noise pattern was not observed in the analysis of acoustic pressure signals in the intake system using Short Time Fourier Transform (STFT). The simulation procedure was also used to inform the design of an experimental rig to recreate the surge noise under laboratory conditions. An experimental turbocharger noise rig, designed and built for this purpose, is explained in the Thesis. Important component parts likely {{to be involved in the}} surge noise generation such as the intake system, compressor, throttle body, compressor recirculation valve and measurement and control systems were integrated into the test rig. Background noise contributions from the electric motor, AC mains, supercharger pulley, throttle body, inverter fan, throttle body gearing and structural vibration of the supporting structure were identified from the analysed frequency components of the signals from surface microphone measurements taken at the intake system. This helped to clearly identify the surge noise frequency components (3250 Hz) in the STFT analysis. The fundamental mechanism of noise generation was identified using an analysis of the experimental results and a frequency calculation for vortex shedding and the radial acoustic resonances. One of the main conclusions of the Thesis is that the compressor recirculation valve (CRV) open or close position, the CRV delay time and the throttle position are major contributing factors to the cause of the surge noise. Another major conclusion is that the radial acoustic resonance may be a mechanism of surge noise generation. Finally, a passive solution to reduce the surge noise is proposed. A pipe with cross ribs is designed as a passive solution using the radial acoustic resonance calculation and the corresponding nodal patterns. This solution demonstrated a measured <b>intake</b> system <b>noise</b> reduction of up to 10 dB under compressor surge conditions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to seek a means of numerically {{simulating}} and analyzing the aerodynamic and acoustic behaviour of industrial gas turbine intake or exhaust systems. The method was developed in an effort to advance the current state of the art employed for the prediction of <b>intake</b> and exhaust <b>noise.</b> Current methods rely upon the summation of experimentally gathered insertion loss data for individual system components. This approach requires that physical testing of chosen components be undertaken which can be both costly and time consuming. The proposed numerical method is based upon a two stage finite volume solution of the two dimensional non linear Euler equations whereby an aerodynamic solution for the mean flow is first obtained followed by a solution for the acoustic field. The method has been found to be both accurate and easy to implement, furthermore being numerically based it eliminates the need for the costly and time consuming procurement and testing of physical prototypes. In this respect it is considered to advance the present state of the art. The two step Euler solver developed herein employs a multiblock finite volume formulation wherein the hyperbolic Euler equations are solved using a cell centred finite volume technique employing a second order central differencing method for spatial discretisation on a multiblock grid and with temporal integration being undertaken using an explicit time marching two stage second order Runge Kutta scheme. In the first step the mean flow is solved using the finite volume method to obtain a transient or pseudo steady state solution. This provides both the general aerodynamic characteristics of the system and a baseline steady state solution for the acoustic analysis. In the second step a perturbation representing an acoustic disturbance is introduced to the mean flow and the non linear Euler equations are again solved using the finite volume scheme. Spurious non physical numerical reflections at the domain boundaries are prevented by the application of the characteristic based non reflecting boundary conditions. The resulting unsteady pressure field is then post processed to generate the unsteady pressure disturbance due to the applied acoustic perturbation. The interaction of the acoustic disturbance can then be evaluated by examination of the pressure amplitudes and frequency spectra at any location within the domain. The scheme was applied to the study of the aerodynamic and acoustic characteristics of an industrial gas turbine emergency shutdown compressor bleed system. It was found to accurately predict the acoustic attenuation characteristics of the system, furthermore it was shown that it could also be usefully applied as a design tool and as an example of this a change of attenuation performance of the bleed system is demonstrated by a simple relocation of the baffle silencer within the system ducting. It is concluded that the method developed herein demonstrates that a numerical solution to predict the acoustic attenuation characteristics of an industrial gas turbine silencing system is possible and as such offers an improved means for undertaking the acoustic design of products for noise control in industrial gas turbine applications.

30|$|The resonance-type {{resistance}} silencer {{is based}} on the principle of the Helmholtz resonator (HR). It has the advantages of simple structure, high amount of noise elimination, and small pressure loss, among other attributes. It is widely used in automotive engine air <b>intake</b> <b>noise</b> control (Sohn and Park 2011). Arefi et al. (2014) was able to improve reverberation time in a conference room using HRs with defined dimensions, diffusers, and sound absorbers. Mao and Pietrzko (2010) carried out an experimental investigation of passive control of sound transmission through a double-glazed window by using an arrangement of HRs. It was shown that a considerable reduction of the transmitted sound pressure levels has been achieved around the mass-air-mass resonance frequency (50 – 120  Hz). Lee et al. (2013) studied the effect of leakage on the acoustic performance of reactive silencers, such as expansion chambers, HRs, and quarter-wave resonators. Sanada and Tanaka (2013) used two degree of freedom Helmholtz-based resonators with a flexible panel to extend the frequency range of resonant sound absorbers. Yasuda et al. (2013), based on the typical structure, designed a muffler with an interconnecting hole on the tail tube, which was proposed to improve its acoustic performance. Park (2013) introduced a micro-perforated panel of absorbers backed by HRs to improve sound absorption in the low-frequency region, where conventional micro-perforated panel absorbers cannot provide sufficient absorption. Singh and Rienstra (2014) presented a systematic derivation of a solution of the nonlinear HR equation, in order to obtain analytically expressions for impedances close to resonance, while including nonlinear effects. Atak et al. (2014) combined two concepts to design acoustic lenses that are based on HRs. It was shown that using HR-based sonic crystals leads to better acoustic lens designs, especially at the low frequencies, where the local resonances are pronounced. At present, research focuses primarily on designing or analyzing HR, which has a good effects on the air inlet system’s low-frequency noise elimination; however, a larger proportion of intake system noise is high-frequency, especially during rapid acceleration. In order to improve an automobile’s riding comfort, it is necessary to establish a method to suppress the engine’s air inlet high-frequency noise during rapid acceleration.|$|E
