This type of gas loss from a planet into space is known as planetary wind. Such a process over geologic time causes water-rich planets such as the Earth to evolve into planets like Venus. Additionally, planets with hotter lower atmospheres could accelerate the loss rate of hydrogen.|$|E

25|$|The {{upper part}} of the thermosphere, where the mean free path of the {{molecules}} exceeds the scale height, is called the exosphere. The lower boundary of the Uranian exosphere, the <b>exobase,</b> is located at a height of about 6,500km, or 1/4 of the planetary radius, above the surface. The exosphere is unusually extended, reaching as far as several Uranian radii from the planet. It is made mainly of hydrogen atoms and is often called the hydrogen corona of Uranus. The high temperature and relatively high pressure {{at the base of the}} thermosphere explain in part why Uranus's exosphere is so vast. The number density of atomic hydrogen in the corona falls slowly with the distance from the planet, remaining as high a few hundred atoms per cm3 at a few radii from Uranus. The effects of this bloated exosphere include a drag on small particles orbiting Uranus, causing a general depletion of dust in the Uranian rings. The infalling dust in turn contaminates the upper atmosphere of the planet.|$|E

The distribution of velocities of the O atoms {{is important for the}} morphology of the hot O coronas, and for the escape of O from Mars. The spectrum of the O atoms depends on the relative yields of the five energetically accessible channels in dissociative recombination, on the vibrational and rotational distribution of the O 2 +, and on the ion and electron temperatures. We combine here our calculations of the distribution of vibrational levels of O 2 + near the <b>exobases</b> of the earth, Venus and Mars, with measurements by Kella et al. (1997) of the yields of the combinations of electronic states of the product O atoms in dissociative recombination of O 2 + to estimate the spectrum of the O atoms.

Models of the vibrational distribution of O 2 + in the ionospheres of Earth, Venus and Mars are combined with the calculations of Guberman [1987, 1988] of the rate coefficients for the channels producing excited states of atomic oxygen in dissociative recombination of O 2 +(v) and measurements of the total rate of dissociative recombination to give the fractional yields of the channels O(3 P) + O(3 P), O(1 D) + O(3 P), O(1 S) + O(3 P), O(1 S) + O(1 D), and O(1 D) + O(1 D). These calculations also produce a distribution of the velocities of O atoms released at the <b>exobases.</b> The major source of error in the calculation involves the yield of the channel in which two ground state oxygen atoms are produced, which is computed as {{the difference between the}} sum of the rates of excited state production and the total dissociative recombination rate.

40|$|The {{distribution}} of energetic O produced in dissociative recombination of O 2 + at the <b>exobases</b> of the terrestrial planets {{is important in}} determining {{the structure of the}} outer hot O coronas and for the escape flux of O from Mars. Using recently measured values for the branching ratios of the energetically allowed channels in O 2 + dissociative recombination, along with models of the vibrational {{distribution of}} O 2 +, we compute the velocity distribution of hot O atoms produced at the <b>exobases</b> of Mars, Venus, and Earth. We take into account the effects of the ion and electron temperatures, the rotational energy of the ions, and the decrease of the dissociative recombination cross section with relative velocity of the ion and electron. We find that distinct peaks appear at the energies associated with the various channels in the Martian spectrum but that for Venus, the features are less distinct, and for Earth, the distribution appears as a single, but broad and asymmetrical peak. For Mars, we compute the fractions of atoms produced with speeds greater than the escape velocity for 16 O, 17 O, and 18 O of 0. 68, 0. 64, and 0. 58, respectively. Thus there is a small isotope effect inherent in the dissociative recombination mechanism that has not been taken into account in models of Martian atmospheric evolution or in estimates of the total inventory of oxygen that is implied by the observed lack of enhancement of the heavier isotopes relative to the terrestrial values...|$|R

The velocity distributions of the neutral fragments produced in dissociative recombination are determined by the internal energy states of the ion and the product fragments, and by the kinetic temperatures of the ions and electrons. We have computed the velocity distributions produced in O 2 +, NO+, N 2 +, and CO+ DR near the <b>exobases</b> of the terrestrial planets, and discuss the implications for the hot O coronas of the earth, Mars, and Venus, the hot N and C corona of Mars, the escape of oxygen and nitrogen from Mars, and the isotope differentiation that ensues...|$|R

We find that the fractions of 12 C atoms with velocities greater than the escape velocity are ∼ 0. 66 and ∼ 0. 62, and those for 13 C are ∼ 0. 47 and ∼ 0. 48 at the plasma temperatures characteristic of the <b>exobases</b> at low and high solar activities, respectively. The ratio of the escape fractions of 13 C and 12 C, which {{is a measure of}} the isotope effect inherent in the CO+ dissociative recombination mechanism, is thus in the range 0. 72 – 0. 77. Using model thermospheres and ionospheres for low solar activity from Viking, and for high solar activity from the Mars Thermospheric General Circulation Model, we have computed the global escape flux of C due to dissociative recombination of CO+ as (3 − 5) × 105 cm− 2 s− 1. This value is of the same order as current estimates for the escape flux of C in all forms due to sputtering by O+ pickup ions at the current epoch but may be much less than that due to sputtering at earlier times in the history of the planet...|$|R
50|$|At other times, red dwarfs emit {{gigantic}} flares {{that can}} double their brightness {{in a matter}} of minutes. Indeed, as more and more red dwarfs have been scrutinized for variability, more of them have been classified as flare stars to some degree or other. Such variation in brightness could be very damaging for life. Flares might also produce torrents of charged particles that could strip off sizable portions of the planet's atmosphere. Scientists who subscribe to the Rare Earth hypothesis doubt that red dwarfs could support life amid strong flaring. Tidal-locking would probably result in a relatively low planetary magnetic moment. Active red dwarfs that emit coronal mass ejections would bow back the magnetosphere until it contacted the planetary atmosphere. As a result, the atmosphere would undergo strong erosion, possibly leaving the planet uninhabitable.Otherwise, it is suggested that if the planet had a magnetic field, it would deflect the particles from the atmosphere (even the slow rotation of a tidally locked M-dwarf planet—it spins once for every time it orbits its star—would be enough to generate a magnetic field as long as part of the planet's interior remained molten). But actual mathematical models conclude that, even under the highest attainable dynamo-generated magnetic field strengths, exoplanets with masses like that of Earth lose a significant fraction of their atmospheres by the erosion of the <b>exobase's</b> atmosphere by CME bursts and XUV emissions (even those Earth-like planets closer than 0.8 AU—affecting also GK stars— probably lose their atmospheres).|$|R

P. Fanale et al. (1982). The amount of plasma energy deposited in the atmosphere is 20 % of the plasma flow energy due to corotation (J. A. Linker et al., 1988). It is found that plasma heating significantly inflates the upper atmosphere, increasing both the <b>exobase</b> altitude {{and the amount of}} surface covered by more than an exospheric column of gas.

Collisionless models illustrating the consequent structure are discussed, with the nonthermal population mimicked by a dual Maxwellian <b>exobase</b> kinetic distribution. In these models. a considerable fraction of the “hot ” atoms outside 2. ORv belongs to the quasi-satellite component, this fraction exceeding l/ 2 for 4. 0 Rv < r 6 lO. OR,. Quasi-satellites also raise the kinetic temperature near 2. ORv by N 150 K.

30|$|On {{the basis}} of their energy source, we can {{separate}} two main escape categories: thermal escape and non-thermal escape. For thermal escape, atoms at the <b>exobase</b> level have more or less a Maxwellian velocity distribution that is determined by the <b>exobase</b> temperature. Particles with velocities which are larger than the escape velocity of the planet can escape from the planet (e.g., Chamberlain, 1963). In extreme cases when the mean thermal energy of the major species at the <b>exobase</b> level (where the mean free path of the particles is comparable to the atmospheric scale height) exceeds their gravitational potential energy, thermal escape can be considered as “blow-off” (Öpik, 1963). Assuming hydrostatic equilibrium, Kulikov et al.
