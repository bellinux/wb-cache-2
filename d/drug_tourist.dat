40|$|Background The Dutch {{coffee shop}} policy was {{tightened}} in 2012. Two additional criteria that coffee shops must adhere {{to in order}} for them to be tolerated came into force: the private club and the residence criterion. Coffee shops were only permitted to give access to members and only residents of the Netherlands were permitted to become a member. This tightened policy sought to make coffee shops smaller and more controllable, to reduce the nuisance associated with coffee shops and to reduce the number of foreign visitors attracted by the coffee shops. Enforcement began in the southern provinces. The private club criterion was abolished at the end of 2012. Methods A sample of fourteen municipalities with coffee shops was drawn. Seven in the south were treated as an ‘experimental group’ and the others as ‘comparison group’. A baseline assessment and follow-ups at six and 18 months were performed. A combination of methods was applied: interviews with local experts, surveys with neighbourhood residents, coffee shop visitors and cannabis users, and ethnographic field work. Results Drugs tourism to coffee shops swiftly declined in 2012. The coffee shops also lost a large portion of their local customers, since users did not want to register as a member. The illegal market expanded. Neighbourhood residents experienced a greater amount of nuisance caused by dealer activities. After abolishment of the private club criterion, residents of the Netherlands largely returned to the coffee shops. <b>Drug</b> <b>tourists</b> still remained largely absent. Neighbourhood residents experienced more nuisance from coffee shops again. Illegal cannabis sale was tempered. No effect on cannabis use was found. Conclusion The quick and robust shifts in the users’ market in reaction to the policy changes illustrate the power of policy, but also the limitations caused by the dynamic and resilient nature of the Dutch cannabis supply market...|$|R
40|$|The United States {{has shaped}} the global {{response}} to drugs {{over the last}} century. Afghanistan, and its resultant massive opium production, is the greatest failure of the internationalization of the American-led war on drugs. Starting during the Progressive-era, the United States backed a prohibitionist stance toward certain drugs, including opium and its derivatives. While Afghanistan was creating its own opium policies after complete independence from Great Britain, the United States pushed a global anti-drug approach. Despite having minimal contact previously, the Americans and Afghans joined in a brief, but significant, opium alliance during the Second World War, with the United States secretly purchasing the bulk of Afghan opium. After the war, the United States publicly asked Afghanistan to end opium cultivation while suggesting in private that the Afghans should continue production. At the United Nations, the Americans sabotaged the Afghans' attempt to get legal international recognition as an opium exporter. The United States did respond to Afghanistan's destitute condition by supplying developmental aid that would have the unforeseen consequence of increasing poppy cultivation. Improved transportation networks also provided opportunities for Western youth to visit Afghanistan as <b>drug</b> <b>tourists</b> and couriers. During the 1970 s, the decade before the Soviet invasion, Washington's concern over Afghan opium reached {{the highest level of}} government. Despite new efforts to replace opium as a cash-producing plant, Afghan drug production steadily increased. With Afghanistan on the verge of transforming into a global producer of heroin, the United States fomented unrest in the nation by first funding and then backing known drug traffickers. Along with Soviet aggression, the American intelligence program led to chaotic conditions that were capitalized on by drug traffickers. After years of war in the 1980 s and 1990 s, Afghanistan gained the dubious title of the world's most prolific narco-state. After the post- 9 / 11 invasion, with American boots on the ground for over a decade, Afghanistan remained a major source for opium. As a result, Afghanistan was the most visible breakdown of the American global war against drugs...|$|R

40|$|The Joint Committee {{decided to}} {{undertake}} a study into the effects of crimes carried out in communities by gangs and held a number of public hearings in relation to this matter. In the course of its hearings on 18 th February 2015, the Committee was told of an approach adopted by the authorities in Portugal whereby possession of drugs was not dealt with through the Criminal Justice system but by civil/administrative sanctions which has had a very positive result for the communities concerned. As drug supply is {{the main source of}} income to these groups operating in cities and towns throughout Ireland, the Committee decided to send a delegation to Portugal to examine this approach in more detail. It should be noted that it is still an offence to take or possess drugs, but the offence is now treated in a similar way to a traffic offence. However, this approach only applies to possession of a quantity up to 10 day’s supply for personal use [Table 1]. Any person found in possession of drugs must report within 72 hours to a Commission for Addiction Dissuasion for a treatment programme tailored to the individuals needs in order to ensure the best possible result. Possession of more than this stated amount will result in the person falling outside this approach and it then becomes a criminal offence. The delegation was told that in order to break the cycle and allow drug addicts the opportunity to move away from a life of drugs ‘positive discrimination’ for gaining employment was introduced. This system offered employers tax breaks to employ recovering addicts and the State would pay the employee an amount equal to the minimum wage. The employer was required to release the employee for their treatment/counselling until their programme had concluded. The delegation was told that in many cases, these employees gained full time employment and did not go back to using drugs. The approach in relation to drugs has not resulted in an increase in drug taking nor has it resulted in Portugal becoming a destination for <b>drug</b> <b>tourists.</b> The number of HIV/AIDS cases has dropped dramatically...|$|R

40|$|Psychedelic White {{is one of}} {{the most}} innovative, refreshingly {{different}} analyses of race I have read in the last decade. " —Elizabeth Grosz, author of The Nick of Time: Politics, Evolution and the Untimely The village of Anjuna, located in the coastal Indian state of Goa, has been one of the premier destinations on the global rave scene for nearly two decades. The birthplace of Goa trance, the most psychedelic variety of electronic dance music, Anjuna first attracted adventurous Westerners in the 1970 s who were drawn there by its tropical beaches, tolerant locals, and readily available <b>drugs.</b> Today, rave <b>tourists</b> travel to Goa to take part in round-the-clock dance parties and lose themselves in the crowds, the music, and the drugs. But do they really escape where they come from and who they are? A rich and theoretically sophisticated ethnography, Psychedelic White explains how race plays out in Goa’s white counterculture and grapples with how to make sense of racism when it is not supposed to be there. Goa is a site of particularly revealing forms of interracial collision, and contrary to author Arun Saldanha’s expectations that the nature of rave would create an inclusive atmosphere, he repeatedly witnessed stark segregation between white and Indian tourists. He came to understand race in its creative dimension as a shifting and fuzzy assemblage of practices, environments, sounds, and substances—dance skills, sunlight, conversation, cannabis, and tea. In doing so, his work shows how the rave scene in Goa harbors conflicting tendencies regarding race. The complicated intersection of cultures and phenotypes, Saldanha asserts, helps to consolidate whiteness. Race emerges not through rigid boundaries but rather through what he terms viscosity, the degree to which bodies gather together for pleasure and self-transformation. Challenging the prevailing conception of racial difference as a purely social construction and offering building on the works of Gilles Deleuze and Flix Guattari, Psychedelic White presents nothing less than a new materialist approach to race...|$|R

Some of the abandoned buildings include the former headquarters for the Cuauhtémoc borough and have been invaded by squatters since the 1960s and 1970s. In the first decade of the 21st century, the borough neglected much of the repair and maintenance work in the area, forcing the Comité Vecinal de la Colonia Juárez (the neighborhood committee) and the Asociación de Comerciantes de la Zona Rosa (local business association) to take over former city services such as repairing sidewalks, changing lights, maintaining green areas and trash bins. Much of this is paid for with income from local parking meters.Since the 1990s, tourism has fallen in the area, mostly due to petty crime and “hooligans” [...] Crime problems have lowered hotel residency rates.

It suffered two thefts of religious images, one of Saint Charbel and the other called the “Virgen del Cobre” (Copper Virgin) in 2008.

Female prostitution is located mostly in three houses located on Dublin, Hamburgo and Chapultepec streets. Small scale drug trafficking is common, with merchandise hidden in telephone booths, garden areas and street vendor stalls. It is often advertised by people passing out flyers with the names of non-existent businesses in the State of Mexico.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{problems of}} space, solitude, and {{representation of the}} desert region of northern Mexico by examining the narrative works of six contemporary Mexican writers -Ricardo Elizondo, Gerardo Cornejo, Severino Salazar, Miguel Méndez, Jesús Gardea, and Daniel Sada. Relatos en la arena identifies a series of specific rhetorical devices in a corpus of texts produced {{as part of a}} new literary phenomenon known as Desert Literature (literatura del desierto) produced in the last three decades of the Twentieth Century. These authors propose the use of several narrative models such as Historical Novel, Latin American Boom, Regional Novel, Bildungsroman, etc., in order to expose differences and similarities in the construction and definition of desert region of north Mexico. Situated in the desert landscape, the four novels and two volumes of short stories propose the re-writing of a series of traditional discourses that have defined this arid territory. The first chapter is an introduction to the main topic of the desert and its multiple meanings throughout history. The second chapter examines Ricardo Elizondo´s Setenta veces siete and Gerardo Cornejo´s La sierra y el viento, and how these novels propose the Mexican desert as a place where progress and wealth are possible, contrary to canonical literary works that embrace most the traditional myths regarding the Mexican desert as a site for political and spiritual testing and self-scrutiny under extreme conditions of violence and poverty. The third chapter focuses on Severino Salazar´s Desiertos intactos and Miguel Méndez´s El sueño de Santa María de las Piedras, and how these works establish a particular dialogue with narrative models such as Historic and Regional Novel in order to question the ways by which the official discourse has represented specific events that occurred in the area of northern Mexico. Salazar presents a story, in which past and present appear closely linked by the actions of the main characters. On the other hand, Méndez proposes an ironic version a narrative called 2 ̆ 2 desert 2 ̆ 2 and its products -wetbacks, chicanos, <b>tourists,</b> <b>drug</b> dealers, politicians, philosophers, common citizens, etc. Méndez focuses on the arid territory as a complex experience that claims its own identity. The fourth and last chapter explores the topic of solitude as an essential condition of inhabitants of the arid territory of northern Mexico, as marked out in the narrative works of Jesús Gardea and Daniel Sada. The former establishes solitude as a result of lack of human contact, absence of reference, and a constant silence in his characters. The latter proposes solitude as a consequence of abandonment. These short stories present a series of events that reflect aspects of daily life of the desert dwellers and their contradictory condition of abandonment in the open space. The significance of this study lies on the fact that these novels and short stories mean not only a critical response to those works that have produced a traditional perception of the desert region of northern Mexico, but they also mean a crucial way to face problems such as National Space in contemporary Mexico. Desert Literature claims a particular place within the canonical literary works and it focuses on problems related to concepts of space in literary discourses...|$|R
