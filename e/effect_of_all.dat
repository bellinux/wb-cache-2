However, federal income tax receipts increased from 1980 to 1989, rising from $308.7 billion to $549 billion or an average annual rate of 8.2% (2.5% attributed to higher Social Security receipts), and federal outlays grew {{at an annual rate}} of 7.1%.|$|E
5|$|Most {{proteins}} {{consist of}} linear polymers built from series {{of up to}} 20 different L-α-amino acids. All proteinogenic amino acids possess common structural features, including an α-carbon to which an amino group, a carboxyl group, and a variable side chain are bonded. Only proline differs from this basic structure as it contains an unusual ring to the N-end amine group, which forces the CO–NH amide moiety into a fixed conformation. The side chains of the standard amino acids, detailed {{in the list of}} standard amino acids, have a great variety of chemical structures and properties; it is the combined <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> of the amino acid side chains in a protein that ultimately determines its three-dimensional structure and its chemical reactivity.|$|E

25|$|The {{causes of}} and {{responsibility}} for this exodus are highly controversial topics among commentators on the conflict and even historians who specialize in this era. Among the various possible causes, Efraim Karsh attributes the exodus mainly to Arab authorities' instructions to escape, whereas others argue that a policy of expulsion had been organized by the Yishuv authorities and implemented by Haganah. Others yet reject these two assumptions and see the exodus as the cumulative <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> the civil war's consequences.|$|E

Moreover, <b>all</b> types <b>of</b> MWCNTs induced an increase in apoptotic cells. Overall, these data indicated that the cytotoxic <b>effects</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> types <b>of</b> MWCNTs are mediated both from a decrease in the proliferation rate and from an increase of apoptotic cell death.

In a dilute aqueous solution, potassium bromide tastes sweet, at higher concentrations it tastes bitter, and tastes salty when the concentration is even higher. These effects are mainly due to {{the properties of the}} potassium ion—sodium bromide tastes salty at any concentration. In high concentration, potassium bromide strongly irritates the gastric mucous membrane, causing nausea and sometimes vomiting (a typical <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> soluble potassium salts).|$|E
25|$|Unemployment hit {{a low of}} 5.3% in 1988 after peaking at over 10% in 1982. Real GDP growth {{recovered}} throughout Reagan's term, averaging +3.5% per year, with a high of +7.3% in 1984. The {{average annual}} GDP growth during Reagan's presidency was the fifth highest since the Great Depression and the highest of any Republican president. Inflation decreased significantly, falling from 13.6% in 1980 to 4.1% by 1988, and 16 million new jobs were created. The net <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> Reagan-era tax bills resulted in a 1% decrease of government revenues (as a percentage of GDP), with the revenue-shrinking effects of the 1981 tax cut (-3% of GDP) and the revenue-gaining effects of the 1982 tax hike (~+1% of GDP), while subsequent bills were more revenue-neutral. However, tax revenue itself nominally increased massively by 103.1% from 1981 through 1989, {{largely as a result}} of more loopholes abolished than tax rates lowered.|$|E
500|$|Galaxys {{circulation}} {{had held}} relatively steady in the mid-1960s, ranging between 73,000 and 78,000, but the UPD acquisition {{coincided with a}} precipitous drop—from 75,300 for the year ended October 1968, circulation fell to 51,479 just one year later. [...] Difficulties with distribution also cut into income, and Arnold Abramson, UPD's owner, decided {{to cut costs and}} maximize profits. [...] Galaxy went bimonthly in August 1970, ending a two-year spell of monthly scheduling (though a couple of months had been missed). [...] The page count, which had been cut from 196 to 160 when UPD bought it, was increased again, and the price was raised from 60 cents to 75 cents. [...] A British edition began in May 1972, published by Tandem Books, which was owned by UPD. [...] The net <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these changes was a substantial increase in profitability. [...] Circulation in 1972 also rose by about 6,000 issues, though it is possible that this was solely due to the new British edition.|$|E

By the 1930s, “the surfaces of the main roads had all been improved and attention could then be given to widening and improving alignment.” Main roads now had tarmac surfaces in most instances although some sections of road, such as the Carrigrohane Road in Cork, were made from reinforced concrete. Road improvement schemes and road maintenance were effectively suspended during World War II due to the scarcity of tar and bitumen. After the war, roads that had deteriorated due to lack of maintenance during the war were restored and other improvements were made: “the <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> these measures was a marked improvement in both main and county roads.” ...|$|E
2500|$|However, lower-frequency {{dielectric}} heating, {{as described}} in the aforementioned patent, is (like induction heating) an electromagnetic heating effect, the result of the so-called near-field effects that exist in an electromagnetic cavity that is small compared with the wavelength of the electromagnetic field. This patent proposed radio frequency heating, at 10 to 20 megahertz (wavelength 15 to 30 meters). Heating from microwaves that have a wavelength that is small relative to the cavity (as in a modern microwave oven) is due to [...] "far-field" [...] effects that are due to classical electromagnetic radiation that describes freely propagating light and microwaves suitably far from their source. Nevertheless, the primary heating <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> types of electromagnetic fields at both radio and microwave frequencies occurs via the dielectric heating effect, as polarized molecules are affected by a rapidly alternating electric field.|$|E

2500|$|Renal {{impairment}} is {{a significant}} potential adverse <b>effect</b> <b>of</b> <b>all</b> ACE inhibitors that directly follows from their mechanism of action. Patients starting on an ACE inhibitor usually have a modest reduction in glomerular filtration rate (GFR) that stabilizes after several days. However, the decrease may be significant in conditions of decreased renal perfusion, such as renal artery stenosis, heart failure, polycystic kidney disease, or volume depletion. In these patients, maintenance of GFR depends on angiotensin-II-dependent efferent vasomotor tone. Therefore, renal function should be closely monitored over {{the first few days}} after initiation of treatment with ACE inhibitor in patients with decreased renal perfusion. A moderate reduction in renal function, no greater than 30% rise in serum creatinine, that is stabilized after a week of treatment is deemed acceptable as part of the therapeutic effect, providing the residual renal function is sufficient. This is especially a problem if the patient is concomitantly taking an NSAID and a diuretic. When the three drugs are taken together, [...] the risk of developing renal failure is significantly increased.|$|E
