When the goddess has had her fill she is returned to her temple by the priests. Tacitus adds that the goddess, the cart, and the cloth are then washed by slaves in a secluded lake.

500|$|AllMusic's Stephen Thomas Erlewine {{selected}} the track as an album pick, but {{stated that the}} honest songs on Unbroken, including [...] "Fix a Heart", [...] "Skyscraper" [...] and [...] "For the Love of a Daughter", were similar {{to the content of}} Lindsay Lohan's record A Little More Personal (Raw) (2005). He also criticized Lovato's voice, saying that she [...] "doesn't quite have the pipes to sing [...] without straining". In contrast, Joe DeAndrea of AbsolutePunk wrote, [...] "Lovato's vocals are unmatched – not only compared to her previous efforts, but the majority of vocalists in general. [...] The emotion throughout tracks like 'Lightweight' and 'Fix a Heart' show the true compassion within her voice as you can <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> heartache pouring out of the speakers". Jenny Chen of Neon Tommy called it [...] "one of the purest, rawest songs" [...] on the record.|$|E

About the song's theme, Sean Dooley of About.com commented, [...] "Swift takes no prisoners in her quest {{to make a}} former flame <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> wrath for doing her wrong." [...] In the first verse, Swift introduces relationship by stating she acknowledged {{the fact that her}} former boyfriend was more in love with himself than with her. The second verse has Swift plotting retaliation: [...] "There's no time for tears / I'm just sitting here planning my revenge / There's nothing stopping me / From goin' out with all of your best friends." [...] For the refrains, she speaks of igniting fire on photographs of her ex-boyfriend, concluding them with a musical punch line, [...] "As far as I'm concerned / You're just another picture to burn". Critics have found the song to a symbol of feminism.|$|E
500|$|... "Lucky" [...] {{received}} general acclaim {{from music}} critics. A {{review by the}} NME staff said that [...] "Lucky" [...] is [...] "perhaps Britney's finest moment. The ultimate mallrat, bittersweet teenage symphony." [...] They considered the song [...] Spears' version of [...] "Where Did It All Go Wrong?" [...] by English rock band Oasis, and went to describe it as [...] "a heart-rending tale of life {{at the top of}} the teen pop tree, transformed into an anthem for dramatic, moody 12-year-old girls everywhere by Max Martin's scary talent for teenybop lyrics." [...] However, it was noted that some of the lyrics [...] "sounds pretty heavy when you've just been dumped and Britney's Mickey Mouse Club-trained falsetto is reaching its peak." [...] David Veitch of Calgary Sun called [...] "Lucky" [...] a [...] "sweetly melodic mid-tempo song" [...] and regarding the lyrics commented, [...] "We <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> pain." [...] Billboard magazine contributor Chuck Taylor praised [...] "Lucky" [...] and featured the song on the Spolight column of his Singles Review section. Taylor stated that: [...] "its contagious melody, bang-in-your-brain hook, the empathetic theme of a girl who's the world biggest superstar and yet feels all alone (hmm...) will make it an easy sell to top 40 radio and to her grand legion of dedicated fans".|$|E

Hale also noted {{the introduction of the}} Darkhold, Coulson and May's interactions, and the added mystery to Mace's character as all things that make [...] "for good viewing and has me hooked for next week." [...] Vulture's Scott Meslow scored the episode three stars out of 5, feeling the season was lacking a [...] "truly compelling villain" [...] and saying the ghost effects look [...] "absolutely terrible". Meslow said the prison scenes had [...] "quippy dialogue" [...] and [...] "solid action scenes", but was more interested in the Mace/Simmons storyline. For Nerdist, Joseph McCabe said, [...] "When S.H.I.E.L.D. is at its best, it doesn’t offer viewers much to dissect. Because it’s all about its momentum, [...] is a textbook example: forty-two minutes of adrenaline without a single wasted moment." [...] He felt the episode had several satisfying character-based moments, especially the scenes between Coulson and May, and though McCabe felt Woods was not the most [...] "adept at staging fight sequences", he still praised the choreography of Johnson's action scenes.|$|E

500|$|Kathryn Bigelow's thriller Zero Dark Thirty marked Chastain's final film {{release of}} 2012. The film tells a partly fictionalized {{account of the}} decade-long manhunt for Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden after the September 11 attacks. Chastain was cast as Maya, an emotionally {{hardened}} CIA intelligence analyst who helped kill bin Laden. The difficult subject matter made it unpleasant for Chastain to film. She suffered from depression while working and once walked off the set in tears because {{she was unable to}} continue. Chastain was unable to meet the undercover agent on whom Maya was based and she relied on the screenwriter Mark Boal's research. Zero Dark Thirty received critical acclaim but was controversial for scenes of torture that were shown providing useful intelligence in the search for bin Laden. Peter Travers of Rolling Stone thought that Chastain played Maya [...] "like a gathering storm in an indelible, implosive performance that cuts so deep we can <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> nerve endings". Roger Ebert made note of Chastain's versatility, and favorably compared her ability and range to that of actress Meryl Streep. For her performance, Chastain won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress in a Drama and earned Academy, BAFTA and SAG nominations for Best Actress.|$|E
500|$|During the season, the {{producers}} worked with Glenn Hetrick of Optic Nerve Studios {{to help create}} Raina's Inhuman look, and introduce the Inhumans to the MCU. To get to the final look, the writers {{spent a lot of}} time discussing what her transformed look would entail, such as if she would have a nose, or a tail, with series writer Drew Greenberg eventually suggesting thorns. With the design idea in hand, Hetrick and his team began compiling potential designs for the character, looking to the Clive Barker film Nightbreed, specifically the character Shuna Sassi, because [...] "She's a creature covered in porcupine quills and that image is so strong — it creates such a striking silhouette". Since Hetrick and his team did not have source material to pull from in the comics, he wanted to [...] "make her feel like the first real Inhuman" [...] and give her face a level of symmetry. When creating the prosthetic makeup, which was done in two weeks, {{the producers}} wanted to still be able to see Negga's eyes, with Bell saying, [...] "Ruth Negga has amazingly expressive eyes and eyebrows. And she gets so much of who Raina is through the eyes. We wanted her to still be able to communicate, we still wanted you to <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> expressions through all of [...]" ...|$|E
500|$|Ranaut {{achieved}} success {{later in}} 2013 for her portrayal of Kaya, a shapeshifting mutant, in Rakesh Roshan's science fiction film Krrish 3, alongside Hrithik Roshan, Priyanka Chopra and Vivek Oberoi. When Rakesh Roshan first offered the role to her, she declined it due a disappointing prior association {{with him on}} Kites, in which Roshan had served as producer. Following Ranaut's rejection, other actresses also turned down the role. Roshan approached her again and after assuring her that the role {{would not be a}} minuscule one, Ranaut accepted the part. Critics thought that Krrish 3 was entertaining but lacking in originality, though Ranaut's performance garnered praise. The critic Sarita Tanwar of Daily News and Analysis said: [...] "Kangana Ranaut is delightful as an alien making the weird hair and clothes work for her. She even manages to make you <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> pain. Quite an accomplishment that!" [...] With global ticket sales of , the film {{emerged as one of the}} highest-grossing Bollywood films of all time, becoming Ranaut's most financially profitable venture. Also that year, Ranaut played the eponymous lead in the musical drama Rajjo. The film was a critical and commercial failure and Ranaut's portrayal of a nautch girl was largely criticised. Paloma Sharma of Rediff.com commented that [...] "Kangana Ranaut struggles with her Mumbaiyya dialogues and is not as graceful in the dance sequences as one would have expected." ...|$|E

500|$|Retrospective reviews on Impossible Princess—both from European and Australasian areas—have {{been much}} more positive, with AllMusic's Chris True {{labelling}} it a [...] "pretty damn good record", and openly criticised the critical reception around the album's early release, deeming it a [...] "shame". Nevertheless, he believed that [...] "Unlike Minogue's early work, this album sounds stronger and has a more natural <b>feel.</b> <b>Her</b> songwriting abilities {{have come a long}} way, and Impossible Princess actually flows together as an album." [...] Slant Magazine editor Sal Cinquemani awarded it four stars, and was impressed with the album's [...] "starkly personal and unified cord", saying it [...] "is the work of an artist willing to take risks, not a pop queen concerned with preserving her reign." [...] Cinquemani added it to the staff choices of their Vital Pop: 50 Essential Pop Albums lists. Awarding four stars, Nick Levine from British tabloid Digital Spy commended the mixture of genres and Minogue's input. Although he noticed the material's lack of commercial appeal, he concluded, [...] "Brave, revealing and rarely less than surprising, it's a key piece in the trickier-than-you-think jigsaw puzzle that is Kylie Minogue's recording career." [...] While reviewing her tenth album X (2007), Evan Sawdey from PopMatters commented [...] "For those who still have a copy of her Manic Street Preachers-assisted Impossible Princess, then you have one of the most crazed, damn-near perfect dance-pop albums ever created." ...|$|E

You pass away from the moment into the infinite, where there are no moments and where there’s no time. Here in an embodied state, the body, like all physical things, participates in entropy and all the other artifacts of time. There’s a thin but nevertheless impermeable membrane between the chronological and the timeless that has become much more real to me since my lover died a year ago. Even though I <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> soul, the absence of her body feels like an enormous barrier. The absence of the spoken word, the absence of the sound of her voice, or the touch of her skin. All the things that only can be done by souls with bodies on them... But you know the only time that I feel in contact with her, really, is when her spirit temporarily borrows someone else’s body to dance. Like the moment that you and I were dancing up in your apartment a few months ago. And suddenly she was in you and I could <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> there. You quit dancing the way you danced and started dancing the way she danced. And it was almost like a practical joke that she was playing in a way." ...|$|E

[...] The sculpture was designed to represent {{the spirit of the}} community. Bass interpreted this in the figure which he intended [...] "the love which Canberra people have for their city to be identified with her...I want them to be conscious of her first as an image from a distance...then comes the moment when they become personally involved with her... they <b>feel</b> <b>her</b> looking at them, reflecting their love for the place".|$|E

Another positive review came from Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone who complimented Madonna's camaraderie during the show saying, [...] "She hasn't reached so far onstage, musically or emotionally, since her 2001 Drowned World extravaganza."
