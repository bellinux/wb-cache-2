5|$|On the Taaienberg, Tiesj Benoot (Lotto–Soudal) led the peloton, with Boonen {{right behind}} him. A ten-rider group {{broke away from}} the peloton over the climb, with Benoot and Boonen joined by Roelandts, Cancellara, Boom, Vanmarcke, Daniel Oss (BMC) and three other Etixx–Quick-Step riders (Terpstra, Štybar and Trentin). On the next climb, the Boigneberg, Cancellara's rear {{derailleur}} failed and it took more than a minute for his team to bring him a replacement bike, putting <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way behind the other favourites. Shortly afterwards, the breakaway was caught by the chasing group; the combined group was then caught by another group that contained Sagan and Kwiatkowski to create a 20-man lead group, although Štybar soon suffered a puncture and fell out of the group. Cancellara, meanwhile, was in a group led by his teammates Yaroslav Popovych and Markel Irizar around two minutes behind.|$|E
5|$|The {{performance}} was given on 29 September to an invited audience including Sir Henry Wood {{and most of}} the professional musicians in London. Five months later, when Holst was in Greece, Boult introduced The Planets to the general public, at a concert in February 1919; Holst sent <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> letter full of suggestions, but failed to convince him that the suite should be played in full. The conductor believed that about half an hour of such radically new music was all the public could absorb at first hearing, and he gave only five of the seven movements on that occasion.|$|E
25|$|In {{the course}} of an amoebaean song exchange, Corydon and Amyntas praise the emperor, {{attributing}} godlike qualities to him and stating that he has brought fertility, prosperity and peace to the land and wish <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> reign.|$|E

25|$|Warrick was {{a member}} of the Democratic Party, working with the administrations of John F. Kennedy, Lyndon Johnson and Jimmy Carter on labor and {{education}} issues. Upon Carter's 1980 defeat, she sent <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> letter thanking him for his efforts. He replied, telling her that if he had hired her as a speechwriter, he would have been reelected. Warrick had generally liberal political views. In her first years at All My Children, Warrick was flustered by her character's conservative politics and support of U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War, which Warrick strongly opposed.|$|E
25|$|When he {{was still}} in the Academy of Theatre and Film Arts Stefan Valdobrev was {{assigned}} to compose the music for almost every one of the performances he played in. This is how he gained skills directly in practice. By the end of his acting education he had already written the scores for 10 stage performances. His work garnered attention, providing <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> list of commissions to the professional scene. He then enjoyed a long period of productive years, composing the music for more than 70 theatre plays and 20 feature and documentary films, receiving many plaudits, awards and nominations.|$|E
25|$|It is Nancy {{who first}} antagonizes him. Nancy's idea about living at {{different}} beaches {{for the rest}} of their lives is distasteful to him. He will not let her push him into even considering such a lifestyle. Nancy later tells him, much to his surprise, that she considered divorcing <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago because she believed he was having an affair. Charlie tells her he did not have such a liaison, and she believes him. Charlie was happy with the way his life with Nancy was and still is. Their disagreements over this matter are overshadowed by the appearance of the lizards.|$|E

500|$|An {{old friend}} of John Winchester, Ellen Harvelle is the wife of hunter William Anthony Harvelle {{and the mother of}} Jo Harvelle. She runs Harvelle's Roadhouse, a saloon and pub frequented by hunters of supernatural creatures. When Sam and Dean Winchester arrive there in the second season episode [...] "Everybody Loves a Clown", a wary Ellen holds them at gunpoint until she learns that they are John's sons. She gives them {{information}} regarding a dangerous hunter named Gordon Walker in [...] "Bloodlust", while Sam and Dean later explain to her in [...] "Simon Said" [...] about the demon Azazel's planned war against humanity. Her relationship with the brothers is strained in the episode [...] "No Exit", where she reveals that she believes her husband's death {{was the result of a}} mistake made by John Winchester while they were working together on a hunt. However, she admits to Sam in [...] "Hunted" [...] that her husband's death was not John's fault and that she had forgiven <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago. She also does not blame the brothers for Jo's decision to go off hunting by herself.|$|E

2500|$|Kiprusoff's {{future was}} a late-season storyline, {{and while the}} goaltender himself refused to confirm or deny {{speculation}} {{it would be his}} last season in the NHL, his final home game of the season was viewed by the fans as a celebration of his career. [...] The crowd chanted his name and gave <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> standing ovation following a 32-save performance in a 3–1 victory over the Anaheim Ducks.|$|E
2500|$|Admiral Zheng He {{and other}} unnamed people had {{received}} orders to escort the ambassadors back home. They carried imperial letters and many gifts for several kings. The King of Cochin received special treatment, {{because he had}} sent tribute since 1411 and later also sent ambassadors to request the patent of investiture and a seal. The Yongle Emperor granted him both requests, conferred to <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> inscription (allegedly composed by the emperor himself), and gave the title [...] "State Protecting Mountain" [...] to a hill in Cochin.|$|E
2500|$|After {{discovering}} a mutual interest in racing, McQueen and Great Escape co-star James Garner became good friends. Garner lived downhill from McQueen, who recalled: [...] "I {{could see that}} Jim was neat around his place. Flowers trimmed, no papers in the yard... grass always cut. So to piss him off, I'd start lobbing empty beer cans down the hill into his driveway. He'd have his drive all spic 'n' span {{when he left the}} house, then get home to find all these empty cans. Took <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time to figure out it was me." ...|$|E

2500|$|In an authortracker e-mail Victoria Holmes {{says that}} one of the main themes of Firestar's Quest is that [...] "two cats are {{genuinely}} torn following the warrior code and doing what they believe is right for themselves". In the book, Firestar is asked to find and rebuild SkyClan which described as Holmes [...] "will take <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way outside the warrior code and all that he believes in". A review commented that [...] "themes of faith and responsibility give it depth" [...] and also added that [...] "It's quite satisfying watching Firestar and Sandstorm assemble a ragtag group of cats into a true clan" [...] and compared to movies such as The Bad News Bears to Major League.|$|E
2500|$|Rachmaninoff also possessed {{an uncanny}} memory—one {{that would help}} put him in good stead {{when he had to}} learn the {{standard}} piano repertoire as a 45-year-old exile. He could hear a piece of music, even a symphony, then play it back the next day, the next year, or a decade after that. Siloti would give <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and demanding piece to learn, such as Brahms' Variations and Fugue on a Theme by Handel. Two days later Rachmaninoff would play it [...] "with complete artistic finish." [...] Alexander Goldenweiser said, [...] "Whatever composition was ever mentioned—piano, orchestral, operatic, or other—by a Classical or contemporary composer, if Rachmaninoff had at any time heard it, and most of all if he liked it, he played it {{as though it were a}} work he had studied thoroughly." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cash {{was last}} arrested in 1967 in Walker County, Georgia, after police found he was {{carrying}} a bag of prescription pills and was in a car accident. Cash attempted to bribe a local deputy, who turned the money down. The singer was jailed for the night in LaFayette, Georgia. Sheriff Ralph Jones released him after giving <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> talk, warning him about the danger of his behavior and wasted potential. Cash credited that experience with helping him turn around and save his life. He later returned to LaFayette to play a benefit concert; it attracted 12,000 people (the city population was less than 9,000 at the time) and raised $75,000 for the high school. Reflecting on his past in a 1997 interview, Cash noted: [...] "I was taking the pills for awhile, and then the pills started taking me." ...|$|E

2500|$|When McGready came to Logan County, {{he brought}} with <b>him</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> {{tradition}} {{known as the}} Scottish sacrament season, which was still being practiced regularly by Presbyterian congregations. [...] Begun after the tumultuous changes of the Scottish Reformation in the mid-seventeenth century, the sacrament season became a replacement for Catholic Corpus Christi festivals, {{and served as a}} response to fears that Protestant religion had lost its communal expression, making religion an increasingly privatized affair. [...] The sacrament season occurred over several days, in warm weather months. [...] It included outdoor preaching, large numbers of people often traveling long distances, long vigils of prayer, and often dramatic conversion experiences. [...] One of the largest of these observances occurred in Cambuslang, outside Glasgow, Scotland, in 1742, where upwards of 30,000 people came to hear the preaching of George Whitefield. [...] Sacrament observances such as Cambuslang, whose timing coincided with the Great Awakening in England, Ireland, and the American Colonies throughout the 1740s, had become associated with revivalism, and both clergy and lay people reflected the expectation that the communion season would bring “the most intense religious experiences, the most agonizing despair and the most ecstatic joy." ...|$|E
