The <b>kasugamycin</b> binding sites are present on top of helix 44 (h44), spanning the region between h24 and h28, which contacts the conserved nucleotides A794 and G926.

The effect of <b>Kasugamycin</b> differed widely, 102 transcripts were at least twofold more sensitive to <b>Kasugamycin</b> than average, and 137 transcripts were at least twofold more resistant, and there was a more than 100 -fold difference between the most resistant and the most sensitive transcript.

Notably, this was also true for the region - 3 to - 1 upstream of the start codon and the presence of an extended SD motif, which had been proposed to result in <b>Kasugamycin</b> resistance. Comparison of the translatome results with the database RegulonDB showed that the transcript with the highest resistance was leaderless, but no further leaderless transcripts were among the resistant transcripts.

This was not the case for other antibiotic resistance mutations (Tspr and Rifr), indicating that the high frequency of emergence of a mutation for high-level <b>kasugamycin</b> resistance in the genetic background of ksgA is not due simply to increased persistence of the ksgA strain. Comparative genome sequencing showed that a mutation in the speD gene encoding S-adenosylmethionine decarboxylase is responsible for the observed high-level <b>kasugamycin</b> resistance. ksgA speD double mutants showed a markedly reduced level of intracellular spermidine, underlying the mechanism of high-level resistance.

40|$|<b>Kasugamycin</b> ist ein Antibiotikum aus der Klasse der Aminoglycoside. Es inhibiert die Ausbildung des Translationsinitiationskomplexes an kanonischen mRNAs, indem es die Bindung der mRNA in der ribosomalen P-Stelle blockiert. Im Gegensatz dazu inhibiert es aber nicht die Initiation der Translation von so{{genannten}} „leaderless mRNAs“, die direkt mit einem 5 ´-terminalem Startcodon beginnen und somit keine zusätzlichen Startsignale für das Ribosom aufweisen. Vor kurzem wurde gezeigt, dass in E. coli in Anwesenheit von <b>Kasugamycin</b> Ribosomen gebildet werden, denen einige Proteine der 30 S Untereinheit fehlen. Zu den fehlenden Proteinen gehören unter anderem die essentiellen Proteine S 1 und S 2, und das Protein S 12. Da bekannt ist, dass <b>Kasugamycin</b> –im Gegensatz zu anderen Aminoglycosiden- keinen Einfluss auf die Fehlerrate hat und nicht zu einer Verschiebung des Leserahmens während der Translation führt, könnte das Fehlen von S 12, das die Translationsgenauigkeit des Ribosoms negativ beeinflusst, ein Hinweis darauf sein, dass die protein-defizienten Partiklen eine höhere Genauigkeit in der Translation aufweisen. Daher war das erste Ziel meiner Arbeit, diese Hypothese zu bestätigen. Mit Hilfe von „leaderless“ GFP-Konstrukten würde die Translationsgenauigkeit in vivo nach Zugabe von <b>Kasugamycin</b> bestimmt. Die Resultate deuten darauf hin, dass die Fehlerrate der ribosomalen Partikel im Vergleich zu vollständig assemblierten Ribosomen geringer ist. Vorangegangene Experimente haben gezeigt, dass die Behandlung von E. coli mit <b>Kasugamycin</b> die Translation vollständig hemmt. Interessanterweise haben wir im Laufe der oben genannten Studien beobachtet, dass nach längerer Inkubation mit dem Antibiotikum die Synthese von einigen Proteinen wieder beginnt. Da in E. coli keine leaderless mRNAs bekannt sind und die Synthese der Proteine resistent gegen <b>Kasugamycin</b> ist, war das zweite Ziel meiner Arbeit, dieses Phänomen näher zu untersuchen. Nach der Identifizierung der Proteine mittels 2 D-Gel-Analyse und Massenspektrometrie wurden die 5 ´-Enden der korrespondierenden mRNAs bestimmt. Die Studien haben gezeigt, dass diese mRNAs in Gegenwart von <b>Kasugamycin</b> durch einen alternativen Transkriptionsstart nahe am AUG Startcodon oder durch RNA-Degradierung „leaderless“ geworden sind. Weiters deuten die Ergebnisse darauf hin, dass eine RNA Interferase, MazF, an diesem Prozess beteiligt ist. Zusammengefaßt, weisen die Resultate meiner Arbeit auf eine noch nicht beschriebene Überlebensstrategie von Bakterien hin, die induziert wird, wenn die Translation gehemmt wird. Unter diesen Bedingungen könnte es zur Bildung von „leaderless“ mRNAs kommen, die selektiv von protein-defizienten Ribosomen translatiert werden können. Die Synthese dieser spezifischen Proteine könnte zum Überleben der Bakterien unter ungünstigen Bedingungen beitragen. aminoglycoside antibiotic <b>kasugamycin</b> inhibits translational initiation on canonical mRNAs, as it binds to the mRNA {{path in the}} ribosomal P-site {{and thus}} blocks the positioning of the mRNA and the initiator tRNA during translation initiation complex formation. In contrast, the antibiotic does not inhibit translation initiation on leaderless mRNAs, which contain a 5 ´-terminal start codon and therefore are devoid of ribosome recruitment signals present in the 5 ´-UTR. Recently, {{it has been shown}} that treatment of E. coli with <b>kasugamycin</b> results in the formation of ribosomes, which are deficient for several proteins from the 30 S subunit. These particles -termed 61 S particles, according to their sedimentation rate- lack the small ribosomal subunit proteins S 1 and S 2, which are essential for the translational of canonical mRNAs, and protein S 12. As S 12 has been shown to negatively influence the translational fidelity, and <b>kasugamycin,</b> unlike other aminoglycosides, does not induce frame shifting, misreading or read through, these data suggested that 61 S particles might exhibit a higher translational fidelity. Therefore, the first aim of the study was to test for this assumption. Employing a leaderless GFP-construct, in vivo studies revealed an increased translational accuracy of the 61 S particles, which might be attributed to the lack of the ribosomal protein S 12. The addition of <b>kasugamycin</b> blocks the translation of bulk mRNA, as indicated by pulse labeling experiments. However, prolonged <b>kasugamycin</b> treatment results in restored translation of specific proteins. Therefore, the second aim of the study was the identification of the respective proteins by 2 D gel analysis and subsequent mass spectrometry. Primer extension analysis of the corresponding mRNAs revealed that they were rendered leaderless upon <b>kasugamycin</b> treatment, either by alternative transcription or by a cleavage event closely upstream of the AUG start codon. Furthermore, the data suggested the possible implication of a known RNA interferase, MazF, which represents the toxin of a toxin-anti toxin module in E. coli. Overexpression of mazF resulted in the same cleavage in the leader region of the respective mRNAs, however, not in the coding region of these mRNAs. Taken together, these results may indicate a survival strategy for bacteria under conditions where translation is compromised, based on the formation of leaderless mRNAs, which are selectively translated by aberrant ribosomes deficient for some essential proteins. As the proteins synthesized in the presence of the antibiotic are primarily stress response proteins, the selective translation of this conditionally leaderless mRNA regulon might contribute to the viability of the cells under adverse conditions. ...|$|E

While <b>kasugamycin</b> protects A 794 and G 926, and causes enhanced reactivity of C 795, pactamycin protects G 693 and C 795. All four of these bases were previously shown to be protected by P-site tRNA or by edeine, another P-site inhibitor. Apramycin and neamine, which both induce miscoding and inhibit translocation, protect A 1408, G 1419 and G 1494, as was also found earlier for neomycin, gentamicin, kanamycin and paromomycin. A 1408 and G 1494 were previously shown to be protected by A-site tRNA. Surprisingly, myomycin fails to give strong protection of any bases in 16 S rRNA, in spite of having an apparently identical target site and mode of action to streptomycin, which protects several bases in the 915 region.

40|$|AbstractThe {{aminoglycoside}} <b>kasugamycin,</b> {{which has}} previously been shown to inhibit initiation of protein biosynthesis in vitro, also affects translational accuracy in vitro. This is deduced from the observation that the drug decreases the incorporation of histidine relative to alanine into the coat protein of phage MS 2, the gene of which is devoid of histidine codons. The read-through of the MS 2 coat cistron, due to frameshifts in vitro, is also suppressed by the antibiotic. In contrast, streptomycin enhances histidine incorporation and read-through in this system. The effects of <b>kasugamycin</b> take place at concentrations that do not inhibit coat protein biosynthesis. Kasugamycin-resistant mutants (ksgA) lacking dimethylation of two adjacent adenosines in 16 S ribosomal RNA, show an increased leakiness of nonsense and frameshift mutants (in the absence of antibiotic).

In order to find functional interactions that IF 1 may have with rRNA, we have isolated second-site suppressors of a cold-sensitive IF 1 mutant. Joining of the ribosomal subunit seems to be affected in the IF 1 mutant strain and the suppressive effect is a consequence of decreasing the available pool of mature 50 S subunits. The results serve as additional evidence that IF 1 is an RNA chaperone and that final maturation of the ribosome takes place during translation initiation. In this study we have also investigated the effect of a cold-sensitive mutant IF 1 or <b>kasugamycin</b> addition on gene expression using a 2 D gel electrophoresis technique. The effect is much more dramatic when cells are treated with <b>kasugamycin</b> compared to mutant IF 1. The ybgF gene is uniquely sensitive to the IF 1 mutation as well as the addition of <b>kasugamycin.</b> This effect on the native gene could be connected with some property of the TIR sequence of ybgF and supports the notion that <b>kasugamycin</b> addition and the IF 1 cold-sensitive mutation have a similar TIR-specific effect on mRNA translation. Finally we have isolated a suppressor of a temperature-sensitive mutation in ribosomal release factor 1 (RF 1) to shed more light on the translation termination process. The suppressor mutation is linked to an IS 10 insertion into the cysB gene and results in a Cys- phenotype. Our results suggest that suppression of the thermosensitive growth is a consequence of the mnm 5 s 2 U hypomodification of certain tRNA species. The ability of mnm 5 s 2 U hypomodified tRNA to induce frameshifting may be responsible for the suppression mechanism and it supports the hypothesis that modified nucleosides in the anticodon of tRNA act in part to prevent frameshifting by the ribosome.

Electroporation of Frankia strain EAN 1 pec chromosomal DNA into strain EuI 1 c generated several colonies that were resistant to lincomycin or <b>kasugamycin...</b>|$|E
40|$|<b>Kasugamycin</b> {{is a new}} aminoglycosidic antibiotic, {{effective}} against a variety of micro-organisms, including Piricularia oryzae and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1, 2). I t s m o d e of action seems {{to be similar to}} that of strep-tomycin in that it inhibits poly U-directed polyphenylalanine synthesis in bacterial ribo-somal systems (3). A hypothesis was recently presented that the aminoglycosidic antibiotics, such as strepto-mycin, kanamycin, neomycin and paromo-mycin, cause codon misreading which results in a disturbance of protein synthesis. This hypothesis is based on the finding that the aminoglycosides stimulate the incorporatio...|$|E

All patients were suffering from chronic infection with other urogenital diseases and majority of them had received various antibiotics in the past. <b>Kasugamycin</b> was administered in 21 paitent with chronic urinary tract infection due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Excellent, good and poor responses were obtained in 4, 11 and 6 cases, respectively, showing effectiveness to be 70. 1 % (15 cases). Side effects were minimal...|$|E

By {{contrast with the}} concomitant inhibition of macromolecular syntheses in cells deprived of an essential amino acid, RNA production was found to continue in drug-treated cells while protein synthesis was arrested. Such uncoupling process was also observed in bacteria subjected simultaneously to amino acid starvation and treatment with certain antibiotics (neomycin, gentamicin, spectinomycin and <b>kasugamycin)</b> but not with others (streptomycin and kanamycin). These results {{were related to the}} intracellular concentration of guanosine polyphosphates, ppGpp and pppGpp. They were discussed in terms of interaction of aminoglycosides with ribosomes.
