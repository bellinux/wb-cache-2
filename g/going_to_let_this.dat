5|$|Meanwhile, Andy Bernard (Ed Helms) {{uses the}} {{situation}} to host a sex education class {{in order to learn}} if his former girlfriend Erin Hannon (Ellie Kemper) has been having sex with her current boyfriend Gabe Lewis (Zach Woods). Distraught after realizing that they are having sex and after everyone mocks him, Andy throws a tantrum, hurling a box of pizza at the wall and storming out of the conference room. Gabe takes Andy to his cubicle and admonishes him for his behavior, revealing he is aware why Andy hosted the sex ed class. He explains to Andy that the only reason he asked Erin out was because Andy gave his blessing, which Andy reveals was just a result of his difficulty saying no to how politely Gabe asked him. Gabe tells Andy that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> whole situation slide this time and advises Andy to put Erin behind him.|$|E
2500|$|In Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States (1935), the Court also voted {{unanimously}} to declare the National Industrial Recovery Act (NIRA) unconstitutional {{on the grounds that}} it gave the president [...] "unfettered discretion" [...] to make whatever laws he thought were needed for economic recovery. Economics author John Steele Gordon writes that the National Recovery Administration (NRA) was [...] "the first iteration of Roosevelt's New Deal ... essentially a government-run cartel to fix prices and divide markets ... This was the most radical shift in the relation between government and the private economy in American history." [...] Speaking to aides of Roosevelt, Justice Louis Brandeis remarked that, [...] "This is the end of this business of centralization, and I want you to go back and tell the president that we're not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> government centralize everything." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I can't receive your fine," [...] replied Ross, [...] "and, besides, {{you took}} your chances when you shot that sheep. You lost out, and I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you off. <b>This</b> {{poaching}} must stop. You go right along with your guide." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "As you {{are new to}} {{our ways}} I am <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you rest <b>this</b> evening. We will sit about the fire and tell stories. Aunt is a master hand at that, and Saul has reminiscences of the war that are well worth hearing if we can only get him to tell them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, gentlemen," [...] the {{auctioneer}} said, [...] "surely {{you are not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> desirable piece of property go for seven fifty? She would be cheap at double the price. I have sold worse articles for three thousand." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Maybe not. But I reckon I'll ask, anyhow. You {{want me to}} join your I.W.W., and I'm asking questions. Labor strikes--standing up {{for your}} rights--is one thing, and burning wheat or {{slugging}} young farmers is another. Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> Dorn go?" ...|$|E
6000|$|He {{turned to}} greet this other Bostonian, who had hardly {{expressed}} his joy at {{meeting with his}} fellow-townsmen when the hostess rustled softly up, and said, with the irony more or less friendly, which everybody uses in speaking of Boston, or recognising the intellectual pre-eminence of its people, [...] "I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you keep <b>this</b> feast of reason all to your selves. I want you to leaven the whole lump," [...] {{and she began to}} disperse them, and to introduce them about right and left.|$|R
6000|$|Rosalie laughed. [...] "It's a magic ring I've loaned you, my dear," [...] said she, [...] "and {{as long as}} {{you wear}} it, you will be {{invisible}} to all eyes, those of Blueskins and Pinkies alike. I'm <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you wear <b>this</b> wonderful ring, for it will save you from being discovered by your enemies. If at any time you wish to be seen, take the ring from your finger; but {{as long as you}} wear it, no one can see you, not even Earth people." ...|$|R
5000|$|Tomlin joined League One club Yeovil Town {{on trial}} in June 2008. His trial was {{successful}} as he impressed enough to win a two-year contract from Russell Slade; Tomlin stated that [...] "this is my third chance at league football and I am not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> it slip <b>this</b> time." [...] He finished the 2008-09 season as the [...] "Glovers" [...] leading goalscorer with nine goals. Included in this tally was a goal against Premier League side Middlesbrough in a 5-1 defeat at the Riverside Stadium.|$|R

6000|$|... "That's {{the tragedy}} of life--as I always say!" [...] said Mrs. Dalloway. [...] "Beginning things and having to end them. Still, I'm not <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> end, if you're willing."

6000|$|... "She {{acted like}} a little man about it," [...] he {{reported}} to Ludlow. [...] "She'll do. When a girl can take a blow like that the way she does, she makes you wish that more fellows were girls. When I had my first picture refused, it laid me up.

50|$|I know Saddam's {{weapons are}} in Syria due to certain {{military}} deals {{that were made}} going {{as far back as}} the late 1980s that dealt with the event that either capitals were threatened with being overrun by an enemy nation. Not to mention I have discussed this in-depth with various contacts of mine who have confirmed what I already knew. At this point Saddam knew that the United States were eventually <b>going</b> <b>to</b> come for his weapons and the United States wasn't <b>going</b> <b>to</b> just <b>let</b> <b>this</b> go like they did in the original Gulf War. He knew that he had lied for this many years and wanted to maintain legitimacy with the pan Arab nationalists. He also has wanted since he took power to embarrass the West and this was the perfect opportunity to do so. After Saddam denied he had such weapons why would he use them or leave them readily available to be found? That would only legitimize President Bush, whom he has a personal grudge against. What we are witnessing now is many who opposed the war to begin with are rallying around Saddam saying we overthrew a sovereign leader based on a lie about WMD. This is exactly what Saddam wanted and predicted.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, Clarence, I am {{simply not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> you go in. You are sick enough as it is, {{and if you}} are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> that awful old man spend the whole evening here, and drain the life out of you! I will see him, and tell him"-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, mother." [...] Then, after a moment, she said, with a rush: [...] "Did {{you think}} I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him suppose we were piqued at his not coming? Did you suppose I was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> him patronize us, or {{think that we}} were in the least {{dependent}} on his favor or friendship?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'Now {{we shall}} see what you are made of,' he cried. And he held me off by the shoulders, and punched my ribs, and hustled me into his berth. 'Sit down, Ned. I am glad of the chance of having you with me. I'll put the {{finishing}} touch to you, my young officer, providing you're worth the trouble. And, first of all, get it well into your head {{that we are not}} <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> brute kill anybody this voyage. We'll stop her racket.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am this gentleman's representative," [...] he replied, {{indicating}} the Sausage Chappie with a {{motion of the}} hand. [...] "His jolly old personal representative. I act for him. And on his behalf I have a pretty ripe proposition to lay before you. Reflect, dear old bean," [...] he proceeded earnestly. [...] "Are you <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> chance slip? The opportunity of a lifetime which will not occur again. By Jove, you ought to rise up and embrace this bird. You ought to clasp the chappie to your bosom! He has thrown pies at you, hasn't he? Very well. You are a movie-magnate. Your whole fortune is founded on chappies who throw pies. You probably scour the world for chappies who throw pies. Yet, when one comes right to you without any fuss or trouble and demonstrates before your very eyes {{the fact that he}} is without a peer as a pie-propeller, you get the wind up and talk about having him arrested. Consider! (There's a bit of cherry just behind your left ear.) Be sensible. Why let your personal feeling stand in the way of doing yourself a bit of good? Give this chappie a job and give it him quick, or we go elsewhere. Did you ever see Fatty Arbuckle handle pastry with a surer touch? Has Charlie Chaplin got this fellow's speed and control. Absolutely not. I tell you, old friend, you're in danger of throwing away a good thing!" ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{whirling}} words {{expressed the}} {{feeling in my}} own mind. I had {{the same sense of}} being trifled with by these young people, who would not behave so conclusively toward each other as to justify our interference on the ground that they were in love, nor yet treat each other so indifferently as to relieve us of the strain of apprehension. I had lost all faith in accident by this time, and I was quite willing to leave them to their own devices; I was so desperate that I said I hoped they would get lost from us, as they had from me the night before, and never come back, but just keep on wandering round for ever. All sorts of vengeful thoughts went through my mind as I saw them leaning toward each other to say something, and then drawing apart to laugh in what seemed an indefinite comradery instead of an irrepressible passion. Did they think we were <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>let</b> <b>this</b> sort of thing go on? What did they suppose our nerves were made of? Had they no mercy, no consideration? It was quite like the selfishness of youth to wish to continue in that fool's paradise, but they would find out that middle age had its rights too. I felt capable of asking them bluntly what they meant by it. But when they docilely rejoined us {{at the end of the}} races, hurrying up with some joke about not letting me get lost this time, and Miss Gage put herself at my wife's side and Kendricks dropped into step with me, all I had been thinking seemed absurd. They were just two young people who were enjoying a holiday-time together, and we were in no wise culpable concerning them.|$|E

5000|$|ESPN's Mike Breen, {{who called}} the Finals for ABC, added: [...] "It's {{just another example of}} how he's just not going to let them lose.
