500|$|According to Anderson's account, {{the first}} of the stories that became Winesburg, Ohio ({{probably}} [...] "The Book of the Grotesque") was composed, {{on the spur of the}} moment, in the middle of the night, probably while he was staying on the third floor of a rooming house at [...] in Chicago: [...] "...it was a late fall night and raining...I was there naked in the bed and I sprang up. I went to my typewriter and began to write. It was there, under those circumstances, myself sitting near an open window, the rain occasionally blowing in and wetting my bare back, that I did my first writing...I wrote it, as I wrote them all, complete in the one sitting...The rest of the stories in the book came out of me on succeeding evenings, and sometimes during the day while <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> advertising office..." [...] Study of his manuscripts shows that, though it is probably true that most of the stories were written within a relatively short span of time in late 1915, like a number of facts in Anderson's retelling of his writing process (for instance, his claim that he had written the Winesburg, Ohio stories after his earlier books were already published), it is inaccurate to say that the final versions of the stories published in 1919 were exactly the same as the ones written whole four years earlier.|$|E

2500|$|Seventeen-year-old Florence married Cleo Owens, a 23-year-old farmer's {{son from}} Stone County, Missouri, on February 14, 1921. They soon {{had their first}} daughter, Violet, {{followed}} by a second daughter, Viola, and a son, Leroy. [...] The family migrated west with other Owens' relatives to Oroville, California, where they worked in the saw mills and on the farms of the Sacramento Valley. By 1931, Florence was pregnant with her sixth child when her husband Cleo died of tuberculosis. Florence then worked {{in the fields and}} in restaurants to support her six children. In 1933 Florence had another child, returned to Oklahoma for a time, and then was joined by her parents as they migrated to Shafter, California, north of Bakersfield. There Florence met Jim Hill, with whom she had three more children. During the 1930s the family worked as migrant farm workers following the crops in California and at times into Arizona. Florence later recalled periods when she picked 400–500 pounds of cotton from first daylight until after it was too dark to work. She said: [...] "I worked in hospitals. I tended bar. I cooked. <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fields. I done {{a little bit of everything}} to make a living for my kids." ...|$|E

We could go at night with no long ride to take after it was over.--The fourth of July came to seek us this year and we had but to step across the way to see a ball-game. We were at last in the center of our world.|$|E

The others asked for beer. I said I'd take ginger ale. The boys snickered, and I noticed the barkeeper favoured me with a strange, searching scrutiny. Nevertheless, he opened a bottle of ginger ale. Afterward, back in the alleys, in the pauses between games, the boys enlightened me. I had offended the barkeeper. A bottle of ginger ale cost the saloon ever so much more than a glass of steam beer; and it was up to me, if I wanted to hold my job, to drink beer. Besides, beer was food. I could work better on it. There was no food in ginger ale. After that, when I couldn't sneak out of it, I drank beer and wondered what men found in it that was so good. I was always aware that I was missing something.|$|E

60|$|My infatuation for the Oakland water-front {{was quite}} dead. I didn't like {{the looks of}} it, nor the life. I didn't care for the drinking, nor the {{vagrancy}} of it, and I wandered back to the Oakland Free Library and read the books with greater understanding. Then, too, my mother said I had sown my wild oats {{and it was time}} I settled down to a regular job. Also, the family needed the money. So I got a job at the jute mills--a ten-hour day at ten cents an hour. Despite my increase in strength and general efficiency, I was receiving no more than when <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cannery several years before. But, then, there was a promise of a rise to a dollar and a quarter a day after a few months. And here, so far as John Barleycorn is concerned, began a period of innocence. I did not know what it was to take a drink from month end to month end. Not yet eighteen years old, healthy and with labour-hardened but unhurt muscles, like any young animal I needed diversion, excitement, something beyond the books and the mechanical toil.|$|E
6000|$|I had not {{joined the}} Muscatine migration. Just before that {{happened}} (which I think was in 1853) I disappeared {{one night and}} fled to St. Louis. There <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> composing-room of the [...] "Evening News" [...] for a time, and then started on my travels to see the world. The world was New York City, {{and there was a}} little World's Fair there. It had just been opened where the great reservoir afterward was, and where the sumptuous public library is now being built--Fifth Avenue and Forty-second Street. I arrived in New York with two or three dollars in pocket change and a ten-dollar bank-bill concealed in the lining of my coat. I got work at villainous wages in the establishment of John A. Gray and Green in Cliff Street, and I found board in a sufficiently villainous mechanics' boarding-house in Duane Street. The firm paid my wages in wildcat money at its face value, and my week's wage merely sufficed to pay board and lodging. By and by I went to Philadelphia and worked there some months as a [...] "sub" [...] on the [...] "Inquirer" [...] and the [...] "Public Ledger." [...] Finally I made a flying trip to Washington to see the sights there, and in 1854 I went back to the Mississippi Valley, sitting upright in the smoking-car two or three days and nights. When I reached St. Louis I was exhausted. I went to bed on board a steamboat that was bound for Muscatine. I fell asleep at once, with my clothes on, and didn't wake again for thirty-six hours.|$|E
6000|$|I had {{now been}} {{no less than}} eight voyages in the Havre trade, without intermission. So regular had my {{occupation}} become, that I began to think I {{was a part of}} a liner myself. I liked the treatment, the food, the ships, and the officers. Whenever we got home, <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ship, at day's work, until paid off; after which, no more was seen of Ned {{until it was time to}} go on board to sail. When I got in, in the Normandy, it happened as usual, though I took a short swing only. Mr. Everdy, our old mate in the Erie, was working gangs of stevedores, riggers, &c., ashore; and when I went and reported myself to him, as ready for work in the Normandy again, he observed that her gang was full, but that, by going up-town next morning, to the screw-dock, I should find an excellent job on board a brig. The following day, accordingly, I took my dinner in a pail, and started off for the dock, as directed. On my way, I fell in with an old shipmate in the navy, a boatswain's-mate, of the name of Benson. This man asked me where I was bound with my pail, and I told him. [...] "What's the use," [...] says he, [...] "of dragging your soul out in these liners, when you have a man-of-war under your lee!" [...] Then he told me he meant to ship, and advised me to do the same. I drank with him two or three times, and felt half persuaded to enter; but, recollecting the brig, I left him, and pushed on to the dock. When I got there, it was so late that the vessel had got off the dock, and was already under way in the stream.|$|E

One day I quarrelled with him--it was just at the time I met you--and then, for the first time, I heard of your father's being alive. I went out to Africa to bring him back and Da Souza followed me in abject fear, for as my partner he lost half if your father's claim was good. I found your father infirm and only half sane. I did all I could for him whilst <b>I</b> <b>worked</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> interior, and meant to bring him back to England with me when I came, unfortunately he recovered a little and suddenly seized upon the idea of visiting England.
