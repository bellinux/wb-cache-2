5|$|Their {{experiment}} {{showed a}} statistically significant difference in the thickness of the stomach mucosa. The mucosa of rats fed raw or cooked potato modified with the GNA gene was thicker than that of rats <b>fed</b> <b>the</b> unmodified potato.

Pusztai's collaborator Stanley Ewen said that the cauliflower mosaic virus used as a promoter could likely be the cause of the observed changes.|$|E

40|$|This article investigates whether <b>the</b> Federal Reserve's (<b>Fed's)</b> private Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth forecasts, as {{reported}} in the Greenbook of the Fed, contain information about future real and excess stock returns.

40|$|ABSTRACT Ceratitis capitata (medfly) is a {{globally}} important horticultural pest {{that can}} be controlled using the sterile insect technique (SIT), but the success of SIT depends on the sexual performance of mass-reared males when released into the field. We added &# 8220;guarana&# 8221; (Paullinia cupana) powder (derived from an Amazonian fruit that {{is considered to be}} a stimulant with aphrodisiac effects, capable of improving human physical stamina) to the diets of adult male medflies to determine whether it increased their sexual performance. The basic diet of a protein extract + sucrose (1 : 3) was enriched with guarana powder (3 % on a volume basis). Experiments examining sexual competitiveness were performed using lab-reared males <b>fed</b> with <b>the</b> enriched diet vs. lab-reared males <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> basic diet (and lab-reared females <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> basic diet), as well as lab-reared males <b>fed</b> with <b>the</b> enriched diet vs. wild males <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> basic diet (and wild females <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> basic diet). The results of both experiments indicated that males maintained on diets enriched with guarana powder showed higher copulation successes than males <b>fed</b> only with <b>the</b> basic diet. Guarana powder therefore contributed to the greater mating success of lab-reared males (probably because of its stimulant properties), and may represent a new and viable option for increasing SIT effectiveness...|$|R

5|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Industrial Revolution, Northern England had plentiful coal and water power while the poor agriculture in the uplands meant that labour in the area was cheap. Mining and milling, which had been practiced on a small scale in the area for generations, began to grow and centralise. The boom in industrial textile manufacture is sometimes attributed to the damp climate and soft water making it easier to wash and work fibres, although the success of Northern fabric mills has no single clear source. Readily available coal and the discovery of large iron deposits in Cumbria and Cleveland allowed ironmaking and, with the invention of the Bessemer process, steelmaking to take root in the region. High quality steel in turn <b>fed</b> <b>the</b> shipyards that opened along the coasts, especially on Tyneside and at Barrow-in-Furness.|$|E
5|$|By September29, Georges had {{weakened}} to {{a tropical}} storm and completed a small clockwise loop over southern Mississippi. Subsequently, the storm began tracking west-northwestward at a faster pace. Around 1200UTC, Georges weakened to a tropical depression, and the NHC issued their final advisory on the system. At this time, the Hydrometeorological Prediction Center (HPC) initiated public advisories. The depression maintained a well-defined circulation as it tracked close to the Gulf of Mexico; however, the center of circulation remained inland. Large quantities of tropical moisture <b>fed</b> <b>the</b> storm, allowing it to produce torrential rainfall. By September30, the low-level circulation began to detach from the upper-level circulation. The HPC issued their final advisory on the depression early on October1 as it neared the Atlantic Ocean, and it fully dissipated several hours later.|$|E
5|$|Cool air, {{carried to}} the ground by {{thunderstorm}} downdraft, cuts off the inflow of the thunderstorm, destroying its updraft and causing its dissipation. Tornadoes, which form within stronger thunderstorms, grow until they reach their mature stage. This is when the rear flank downdraft of the thunderstorm, fed by rain-cooled air, begins to wrap around the tornado, cutting off the inflow of warm air which previously <b>fed</b> <b>the</b> tornado. When thunderstorms are able to organize into squall lines, a feature known as a rear inflow jet develops {{to the south of}} the mid-level circulation associated with its northern bookend vortex. This leads to an erosion of rain within the broad rain shield behind the squall line, and may lead to acceleration of the squall line itself.|$|E

5|$|Guinea pigs do not {{generally}} thrive when housed with other species. Housing of guinea pigs with other rodents such as gerbils and hamsters may increase instances of respiratory and other infections, and such rodents may act aggressively toward the guinea pig. Larger animals may regard guinea pigs as prey, though some (such as dogs) {{can be trained}} to accept them. Opinion is divided over the cohousing of guinea pigs and domestic rabbits. Some published sources say that guinea pigs and rabbits complement each other well when sharing a cage. However, as lagomorphs, rabbits have different nutritional requirements, so the two species cannot be <b>fed</b> <b>the</b> same food. Rabbits may also harbor diseases (such as respiratory infections from Bordetella and Pasteurella), to which guinea pigs are susceptible. Even the dwarf rabbit is much stronger than the guinea pig and may cause intentional or inadvertent injury.|$|E

40|$|The {{dynamics}} of N metabolism in mature horses were investigated {{when they were}} fed on a low-N diet or the same diet supplemented with sufficient urea or soyabean meal to meet their theoretical N requirements. There were no differences in DM, organic matter or neutral-detergent-fibre digestibilities for the three diets. N digestibilities and digestible-N intakes were similar for the urea- and soyabean-supplemented diets and very low for the low-N diet. For all three diets plasma urea was degraded in the digestive tract to NH which was utilized by the bacterial population as a N source. NH was absorbed from the large intestine into the blood and converted to urea. NH was also incorporated into plasma proteins. <b>The</b> horses <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> low-N diet degraded {{a greater proportion of}} endogenous urea in the digestive tract than did horses <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> urea- or soyabean-supplemented diets.

40|$|Thesis (Msc Food Sc (Food Science)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. An 84 -day {{study was}} {{conducted}} to find a suitable diet and feeding level for the culture of South African abalone (Haliotis midae) in Namibia. Two experimental diets, namely, a seaweed diet (SWD) Laminaria pallida (macrophytic algae) and a formulated diet (FD) (macro-algae), for use in abalone (Haliotis midae) feed development, were evaluated. The animals used in this study were juveniles (24. 33 ± 3. 14 mm shell length; 2. 72 ± 0. 83 g live weight, mean ± SE) and sub-adults (58. 07 ± 10. 33 mm shell length and 41. 96 ± 20. 61 g live weight, mean ± SE). The nutrient profile of the SWD and FD displayed no differences in the protein and carbohydrate levels. Crude protein levels ranged from 4. 91 to 17. 68 % (dry matter (DM) basis). The lipid levels in the FD (0. 25 %) were almost 0. 56 % lower than that in the SWD (0. 76 %). The feed conversion ratio (FCR) and protein efficiency ratio (PER) for the sub-adult abalone ranged from 2. 80 to 10. 90 and 0. 10 to 0. 40, respectively. <b>The</b> juvenile abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD yielded significantly lower (P 0. 05). The relative growth rate (RGR) of juvenile <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD was 25 % lower compared to those <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> SWD, while that of <b>the</b> sub-adult abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD was 29 % lower compared to <b>the</b> abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> SWD. From the daily growth rate (DGR) in terms of daily body weight (DGRBW) calculated after the 84 -day period, repeated-measures ANOVA (RANOVA) indicated no interaction between time period and diet. Although slightly lower, the DGRBW for <b>the</b> juvenile abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> SWD diet (0. 033 g/day) did not differ significantly from the DGRBW of abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD (0. 079 g/day). In contrast, sub-adult abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> SWD exhibited significantly higher DGRBW compared to those <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD. Although <b>the</b> abalone <b>fed</b> on <b>the</b> FD was slightly higher in nutritional content, there was no significantly difference (P > 0. 05) in the nutritional profile of the abalone soft body tissue <b>fed</b> on either <b>the</b> SWD or FD.
