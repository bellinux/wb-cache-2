5|$|Due to {{extremely}} {{cold winter}} temperatures, the falls freeze, creating a dramatic cascade of ice that can last {{well into the}} spring. If there is a rain shortage in the autumn, the falls may virtually <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> In the summer, especially in the rainy months of June and July, the flow can be surprisingly forceful.|$|E
5|$|Fish are {{captured}} by cornering them in shallow water, usually against the bank or under logs. They take advantage when {{bodies of water}} begin to <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> in the summer or early fall and gorge themselves on the resulting high concentrations of fish and tadpoles. They were surprisingly unsuccessful at seizing either live or dead fish under water.|$|E
5|$|The {{black stork}} breeds between April and May in the Northern Hemisphere, with eggs usually laid in late April. In {{southern}} Africa, breeding {{takes place in}} the months between September and March, possibly to take advantage of abundant water prey rendered easier to catch as the rivers <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> and recede—from April and May in Zimbabwe, Botswana and northern South Africa, and as late as July further south.|$|E

According to Broussard and Miller, Take-Two initially agreed, but then only offered $2.5million. Take-Two maintained that they offered $2.5million up front and another $2.5million on completion. Broussard rejected the counteroffer, and on May 6, 2009, suspended all development.|$|E
5|$|By {{the sixth}} or seventh day, all the skin lesions have become pustules. Between seven and ten days the pustules matured and reached their maximum size. The pustules were sharply raised, {{typically}} round, tense, and {{firm to the}} touch. The pustules were deeply embedded in the dermis, giving them {{the feel of a}} small bead in the skin. Fluid slowly leaked from the pustules, {{and by the end of}} the second week the pustules deflated, and started to <b>dry</b> <b>up,</b> forming crusts (or scabs). By day 16–20 scabs had formed over all the lesions, which have started to flake off, leaving depigmented scars.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{deals with the}} spatial and {{temporal}} variability of the climatic parameters and their consequence on the <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> of streams Bô and Débo and on the refill of the ground-water sheet in Soubré area. Methodology used is articulated around {{the study of the}} hydrological assessment according to Thornthwaite in the two catchments, the study of the seasonal and interannual variability of the climatic variables and the study of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> by the determination of the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> and the mobilized volumes as well as their evolution. The hydrological assessment reveals that evapotranspiration is very active in the area of Soubré and has particularly contributed to reduce water resources of the area. Indeed, on the totality of rainfall, only 5. 24 % joined the underground network to refill the groundwater. The evolution of the curves of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> reveals that, in Débo and Bô catchments, <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> lasts in general between 30 and 160 days. The coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> in the both watersheds knew a rise of 1983 to 1991. Since 1991 there has been a relative decline in these coefficients. Thus, the coefficients of <b>drying</b> <b>up</b> continued to increase in recent years inversely with volumes participating in the reduction of water resources in the area and affecting in a pejorative way the groundwater refill...|$|R
5|$|Each year in {{late summer}} {{thousands}} of black swans and ducks descend on the area as the inland waterways they inhabit <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Waterbirds such as pelicans, cormorants, oyster catchers and terns are common often year round. Egrets, ibis, herons and spoonbills feed on the seagrass and fairy wrens, chats, fantails and thornbills feed on insects and plants amongst the samphire. Each September stints and sandpipers arrive from the Northern Hemisphere in a spectacular display. With the abundance of birdlife the area attracts birds of prey with swamp harriers, collared sparrowhawks, black-shouldered kites, kestrels and little falcons are all seen in the skies over St Kilda.|$|E
5|$|Lake Manly and {{its sister}} lakes started to <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> about 10,000 {{years ago as}} the alpine glaciers that fed the rivers that filled the lakes {{disappeared}} and the region became increasingly arid. Fish that had migrated into the lake system from the Colorado River started to die off; the only survivors are the minnow-sized Death Valley pupfish and related species that adapted to living in springs. Ancient weak shorelines called strandlines from Lake Manly can easily be seen on a former island in the lake called Shoreline Butte.|$|E
5|$|Weather {{disasters}} {{and other natural}} occurrences are also sources of mortality. The West Indian manatee and Dugong face risks from hurricanes and cyclones, which are predicted to increase in the future. These storms may also damage seagrass populations. Exposure to brevetoxin from Karenia brevis during a red tide event are also sources of mortality; {{they may be able}} to be exposed to brevetoxin after a red tide has subsided, as it could settle on seagrasses. African manatees can become stranded during the dry season when rivers and lakes become too small or <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> completely.|$|E

5|$|After {{retiring}} from boxing, a decision forced on {{him by his}} ailing knee, Dyer focused on his theatre appearances. His voice though, was not as it once was, and he strained to reach the higher notes of his range and bookings began to <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Dyer then refocussed on boxing, but this time as a manager. In the 1920s he moved to London, where he set himself up as a physical culture expert and ran a small stable of fighters. The three fighters training under him were Bristolians George Rose and Reggie Hobbs and most notably Bert Kirby from Birmingham. Kirby {{went on to become}} the British flyweight champion when he took the title from Jackie Brown in 1930. Dyer also ran a gym for gentleman on the Strand, which was used by fighters such as Bantamweight champion Teddy Baldock and American Packey McFarland who Dyer faced when the two men were boxing instructors in the US Army. The gym was later demolished to make way for a new hotel and Dyer was forced to find a new location.|$|E
5|$|Dry land is also {{important}} as it provides opportunities for basking, nesting, and escaping from temperature extremes. Gaping allows evaporation of moisture from the mouth lining and has a cooling effect, and several species make use of shallow burrows on land to keep cool. Wallowing in mud can also help prevent them from overheating. Four species of crocodilians climb trees to bask in areas lacking a shoreline. The type of vegetation bordering the rivers and lakes inhabited by crocodilians is mostly humid tropical forest, with mangrove swamps in estuarine areas. These forests are of great importance to the crocodilians, creating suitable microhabitats where they can flourish. The roots of the trees absorb water when it rains, releasing it back slowly into the environment. When the forests are cleared {{to make way for}} agriculture, rivers tend to silt up, the water runs off rapidly, the water courses can <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> in the dry season and flooding can occur in the wet season. Destruction of forest habitat is probably a greater threat to crocodilians than is hunting.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to the main quest of defeating the Gym Leaders, there are side quests in which the player can aid NPCs by fulfilling tasks (usually obtaining items); other side quests involve catching legendary Pokémon. The most prominent subplot involves Team Aqua and Team Magma, crime syndicates who want to use Pokémon to alter the climate of Hoenn. In Ruby, the villains, Team Magma, {{want to use the}} legendary Pokémon Groudon to <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> the oceans of Hoenn and increase the region's landmass; in Sapphire, the Team Aqua are the villains and they try to use Groudon's counterpart, Kyogre, to increase the region's water levels. The player's father also introduces the player to Wally, a sickly young boy whom the player helps capture a Pokémon to be his companion as he moves away from the big city. Wally eventually overcomes his illness and becomes a successful Pokémon trainer, ultimately becoming the final challenger the player must face before the Elite Four.|$|E

5|$|Lakes may form in basins {{where there}} is {{sufficient}} precipitation or meltwater from glaciers above. They are usually shallow and saline, and wind blowing over their surface can cause stress, moving the water over nearby low-lying areas. When the lakes <b>dry</b> <b>up,</b> they leave a crust or hardpan behind. This area of deposited clay, silt or sand {{is known as a}} playa. The deserts of North America have more than one hundred playas, many of them relics of Lake Bonneville which covered parts of Utah, Nevada and Idaho during the last ice age when the climate was colder and wetter. These include the Great Salt Lake, Utah Lake, Sevier Lake and many dry lake beds. The smooth flat surfaces of playas have been used for attempted vehicle speed records at Black Rock Desert and Bonneville Speedway and the United States Air Force uses Rogers Dry Lake in the Mojave Desert as runways for aircraft and the space shuttle.|$|E
5|$|Loxton {{also played}} Australian rules football, and in 1942, {{he made his}} debut in the Victorian Football League (VFL)—the highest tier of {{competition}} at the time—playing for St Kilda. One of his teammates was Keith Miller, a future Invincibles colleague. Loxton played as both a forward and a defender, and the pair sometimes played together in attack. The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year, kicking 15 goals. Debuting in round six, he started his career brightly, kicking five and four goals {{in his first two}} matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively, helping his team to two victories. However, the goals and victories began to <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches. St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals.|$|E
5|$|Much of the Merced River basin is at high elevation, {{where an}} alpine climate prevails. The Sierra {{receives}} heavy snowfall in the winter, which melts {{in the spring}} and early summer causing annual flooding. By late autumn the river level has dropped considerably, and some smaller tributaries <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> altogether. Up to 85% of the flow above Happy Isles comes from melting snow. In the dry season, groundwater provides the only base flow to the river. In addition, the river is fed by dozens of high Sierra lakes, the largest of which include Merced Lake, Tenaya Lake, Ostrander Lake, the Chain Lakes, and May Lake. The foothills experience a drier Mediterranean climate, while the San Joaquin Valley floor is dry enough to be considered semi-desert.|$|E

5|$|The {{sycamore}} is {{susceptible to}} sooty bark disease, caused by the fungus Cryptostroma corticale. This causes wilting of the crown {{and the death of}} branches. Rectangular patches of bark become detached exposing thick layers of black fungal spores. The fungus may be present in the heartwood without symptoms for many years, working its way towards the bark following long, hot summers. The spores are hyper-allergenic and cause a condition called maple bark stripper’s disease, a hypersensitivity pneumonitis. Less serious is the fungus Rhytisma acerinum which often forms the disease known as tar spot, in which black spots with yellow margins form on the foliage. The leaves may fall prematurely but the vigour of the tree is little affected. Sycamore leaf spot, caused by the fungus Cristulariella depraedans, results in pale blotches on leaves which later <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> and fall. This disease can cause moderate leaf loss but trees are little affected in the long run.|$|E
5|$|While {{pursuing}} the thief, Spyro discovers a world once inhabited by the dragons, but long abandoned and forgotten. This world {{is under the}} iron-fisted reign of the Sorceress and her Rhynoc army. Spyro meets with Shiela the Kangaroo, Sergeant Byrd the Penguin, Bentley the Yeti, and Agent 9 the Monkey who help him on his quest. Shiela tells Spyro how when the dragons left the realm, the world's magic began to <b>dry</b> <b>up.</b> Spyro travels through each world in the forgotten realm, acquiring aid from the local inhabitants and rescuing the dragon eggs. It is revealed that the Sorceress is seeking not the baby dragons themselves, but merely their wings to concoct a spell that can grant her immortality. Once Bianca learns about this, she turns against the Sorceress and decides to help Spyro defeat her. Spyro fights and defeats the Sorceress, but she survives the battle and waits for him. After he defeats her again and retrieves the last dragon egg, Spyro returns all of the baby dragons to the Dragon Realms.|$|E
5|$|With {{the return}} of the Test players for the 1950–51 season, Davidson had to perform {{strongly}} when given opportunities in order to hold his position. He started his season productively by taking 7/49 in the first innings of the opening match against Queensland, including the wickets of Test players Ken Archer, Colin McCool and Don Tallon, but he expressed disappointment at his erratic line and length, frequently bowling full tosses and long hops. New South Wales won by an innings, and Davidson took four wickets in the return match, but results began to <b>dry</b> <b>up</b> thereafter. He had the opportunity to show his skills against Test opposition as New South Wales played England ahead of the Tests, but he went wicketless, and was dropped in December after the next match against Western Australia.
