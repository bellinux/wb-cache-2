5|$|The {{study of}} finitely {{generated}} abelian groups is quite mature, including the fundamental theorem of finitely generated abelian groups; and reflecting {{this state of}} affairs, many group-related notions, such as center and commutator, describe the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> given group is not abelian.|$|E
5|$|An {{individuals}} {{right to}} privacy is one area of digital forensics which is still largely undecided by courts. The US Electronic Communications Privacy Act places limitations {{on the ability of}} law enforcement or civil investigators to intercept and access evidence. The act makes a distinction between stored communication (e.g. email archives) and transmitted communication (such as VOIP). The latter, being considered more of a privacy invasion, is harder to obtain a warrant for. The ECPA also affects the ability of companies to investigate the computers and communications of their employees, an aspect that is still under debate as to the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> company can perform such monitoring.|$|E
5|$|In his Botanical Gardens and Botanical Literature in the Eighteenth Century (1961), Stearn {{provides}} {{some insight into}} his interpretation of botanical history: The progress of botany, as of other sciences, comes from the interaction of so many factors that undue emphasis on any one can give a very distorted impression of the whole, but certainly {{among the most important}} of these for any given period are the prevailing ideas and intellectual attitudes, the assumptions and stimuli of the time, for often upon them depends the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> particular study attracts an unbroken succession of men of industry and originality intent on building a system of knowledge and communicating it successfully to others of like mind.|$|E

5|$|The {{principles}} of risk parity may be applied differently by different financial managers, {{as they have}} different methods for categorizing assets into classes, different definitions of risk, different ways of allocating risk within asset classes, different methods for forecasting future risk and different ways of implementing exposure to risk. However, many risk parity funds evolve away from their original intentions, including passive management. The <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> risk parity portfolio is managed, is often the distinguishing characteristic between the various kinds of risk parity funds available today.|$|E
5|$|Because {{the balance}} of {{payments}} sums to zero, a current account surplus indicates a deficit in the asset accounts and vice versa. A current account surplus or deficit indicates the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> country is relying on foreign capital to finance its consumption and investments, and whether it is living beyond its means. For example, assuming a capital account balance of zero (thus no asset transfers available for financing), a current account deficit of £1 billion implies a financial account surplus (or net asset exports) of £1 billion. A net exporter of financial assets {{is known as a}} borrower, exchanging future payments for current consumption. Further, a net export of financial assets indicates growth in a country's debt. From this perspective, {{the balance of}} payments links a nation's income to its spending by indicating the degree to which current account imbalances are financed with domestic or foreign financial capital, which illuminates how a nation's wealth is shaped over time. A healthy balance of payments position is important for economic growth. If countries experiencing a growth in demand have trouble sustaining a healthy balance of payments, demand can slow, leading to: unused or excess supply, discouraged foreign investment, and less attractive exports which can further reinforce a negative cycle that intensifies payments imbalances.|$|E

25|$|The <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> {{language}} is valued {{also has an}} effect on language acquisition in bilingual children. Languages that are deemed more useful or more important will dominate the bilingual mental lexicon while the less valued ones will not be acquired as fully. Studies have shown that children showed slower receptive vocabulary development in what they termed the 'minority' language while the children showed monolingual-like development in the 'majority' language. This has been attributed to the lack of opportunities bilinguals had available for the acquisition and development of their 'minority' language.|$|E
25|$|Job {{satisfaction}} is often thought {{to reflect the}} <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> worker likes his or her job, or individual aspects or facets of jobs.

It has been linked to important job outcomes including attitudinal variables (e.g., job involvement, organizational commitment), absenteeism, turnover intentions, actual turnover, job performance, and tension. A meta-analyses found job satisfaction to be related to life satisfaction, happiness, positive affect, and the absence of negative affect.|$|E

The <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> gas can adsorb to a MOF's surface depends on the temperature and pressure of the gas. In general, adsorption increases with decreasing temperature and increasing pressure (until a maximum is reached, typically 20-30bar, after which the adsorption capacity decreases)., However, MOFs {{to be used for}} hydrogen storage in automotive fuel cells need to operate efficiently at ambient temperature and pressures between 1 and100 bar, as these are the values that are deemed safe for automotive applications.|$|E

25|$|In Western {{and some}} other societies, there are {{differences}} of opinion {{as to how much}} cleavage exposure is acceptable in public. In contemporary Western society, the <b>extent</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> <b>a</b> woman may expose her breasts depends on social and cultural context. Displaying cleavage or any part of female breast may be considered inappropriate or even prohibited by dress codes in some settings, such as workplaces, churches, and schools, while in some spaces showing as much cleavage as possible can be permissible or even encouraged. The exposure of nipples or areolae is almost always considered immodest and in some instances is viewed as lewd or indecent behavior. Art historian James Laver argued that the changing standards of revealing cleavage is more prominent in evening wear than in day wear in the Western world.|$|E
