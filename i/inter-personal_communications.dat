40|$|This project {{aimed to}} {{identify}} and explain the contextual factors associated with successful middle change leadership {{as a way of}} determining the value that such initiatives have to enable change to take place in a less confrontational and abstracted manner and whether such evidence could be leveraged to assist in improved and sustained success in similar settings. To achieve this the study explored the role of the educational middle manager as ‘change leader’ in successful organisational change {{and the role of the}} middle leaders relationships with their superiors, peers and subordinates. It has also examined the core capabilities and attributes of associated with creating an organisational climate conducive to successful change and those policies and practices employed to minimise the potential negative impact of change. The research employed two qualitative techniques. The first was a Delphi-style panel of middle leaders {{to identify and}} rank the sets of ‘attributes’ they perceived to be most associated with ‘successful’ change leadership. The second employed a success case method of semi-structured interview to explore in depth the core capabilities employed by ‘successful’ middle leaders in organisational change. The findings suggest <b>inter-personal</b> and intra-personal <b>communications</b> essential to leading and managing change which are seen as complementary change leadership activities. By developing strong operational and relational skills with particular focus on the ability to listen, observe, identify, and report; to form relationships and inspire trust; and to manifest a high degree of behavioural flexibility, middle leaders are better able to minimise the potential negative impact of change...|$|R

Sales promoters are deployed at strategic locations such as in front of malls, large self-service stores, departmental stores and traffic islands in the city. This paper attempts to analyze behavioral drivers which influence consumers’ leisure shopping behavior and measure customer value through empirical investigation in Mexico. The study reveals that sales promoters significantly stimulate interest among customers towards buying products and trigger shopping arousal.

The purpose of the research study was to investigate the significance of the communication barrier further. The two research questions the team focused on were: (1) Are the communication skills further developed by deaf and hard of hearing students at mainstream universities comparable to those of deaf and hard of hearing students at specialized universities? (2) How does attending a mainstream versus a specialized university prepare a deaf individual to communicate through written and oral communication skills? In the first portion of the study, the team distributed an original online survey to obtain demographic data, as well as a sample of written communication skills.

40|$|Abstract. Online {{spaces that}} enable public shared <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications</b> are of {{significant}} {{social and economic}} importance. This paper outlines a theoretical model and methodology, labeled cyber-archaeology, for researching the relationship between such spaces and the behaviors they contain. The methodology utilizes large-scale field studies into user behavior in online spaces to identify technology-associated user constraints to sustainable patterns of online large-scale shared social interactions. Empirical research was conducted to assess the validity of both the theoretical model and methodology. It {{was based on the}} analysis of 2. 65 million messages posted to 600 Usenet newsgroups over a six month period, and 478, 240 email messages sent to 487 email lists managed by Listserv software over a 5 -month period. Overall, our findings support a key aspect of the model, namely that individual ‘information overload ’ coping strategies have an observable impact on mass-interaction discourse dynamics. Further, {{that it is possible to}} demonstrate a link between technology type and information overload impacts through field studies of online behavior. Cyber-archaeology is discussed in terms of its ability to offer insight into aspects of CMC-tool usability, technology design, and to guide future empirical research...|$|E
40|$|In {{a series}} of pioneer {{contributions}} to electoral geography-the study of spatial patterns of voting-Cox has outlined the role of location variables in voting decisions. Previous studies have mostly used what McPhail (1971) terms the 'Areal Structural Approach', in which voting characteristics are correlated with {{a series of}} socio-economic and demographic variables relating to areal units. The occasional inclusion of spatial variables (such as distance from a coalfield: Roberts and Rummage, 1965) has suggested that location per se plays an active role in patterning the voter response surface, but in most cases areal differentiation has been the basic interest and location has been assigned a passive role in accounting for the observed patterns. Cox's major contribution has been to suggest and indicate how a voter's relative location within an electorate, and thus his location relative to the complex webs of <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications,</b> influences the information he receives and the de-cision he makes (Cox, 1969 a). Specifically, Cox (1971) suggests that three types of variable with spatial connotations affect the voting decision. The first are the social group variables, involving the tendency for all members of certain groups-whether socio-economic, demo-graphic, ethnic or merely some voluntary associa-tion-to vote the same way on most issues. Members of such groups usually live in relative spatial segrega-tion, especially within cities (Johnston, 1971 a); this results in most people in any part of a city voting the same way, but in the evolution of these votin...|$|E
40|$|This {{publication}} is {{an overview}} of a detailed study of coral distribution, diversity and affinities worldwide. The species distribution maps in www. coralsoftheworld. com are based on comprehensive global assessments of the world’s 150 coral ecoregions. Original surveys by the authors cover 4941 sites in 85 ecoregions worldwide. These are combined with a thorough summation of all biogeographic, taxonomic and related literature {{as well as an}} extensive review of museum and photographic collections worldwide and extensive <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications.</b> Species occurrences in ecoregions are recorded as confirmed, strongly predicted, uncertain or absent. These data are used to present global maps of diversity and affinity at species level. There are two templates of Indo-Pacific diversity and affinity: one dominated by the Coral Triangle and one created by poleward continental boundary currents. There is a high degree of uniformity within {{the main body of the}} Coral Triangle; diversity and affinities both decrease in all directions. The Sunda Shelf ecoregion now qualifies for inclusion in the Coral Triangle and the Java Sea ecoregion is borderline. There is very little Indo-Pacific provincialism. Two separate centres of diversity occur in the Indian Ocean: the subequatorial west, and the Red Sea. Most species of the far eastern Pacific occur in the central Pacific. The Caribbean dominates Atlantic distribution and affinities and also has high uniformity. Individual ecoregions have very varying data comprehensiveness. Distribution patterns that distinguish between geographic variation within a species and the geographic overlap of sister species support the concept of reticulate evolutio...|$|E

The system, aimed at using the capability of ESnet and Internet 2 for rapid data exchange, {{is based on the}} Virtual Room Videoconferencing System (VRVS) developed by Caltech. The VRVS system has been chosen by the Internet 2 Digital Video (I 2 -DV) Initiative as a preferred foundation for the development of advanced video, audio and multimedia collaborative applications by the Internet 2 community. Today, the system supports high-end, broadcast-quality interactivity, while enabling a wide variety of clients (Mbone, H. 323) to participate in the same conference by running different standard protocols in different contexts with different bandwidth connection limitations, has a fully Web-integrated user interface, developers and administrative APIs, a widely scalable video network topology based on both multicast domains and unicast tunnels, and demonstrated multiplatform support. This has led to its rapidly expanding production use for national and international scientific collaborations in more than 60 countries. We are also in the process of creating a 'testbed video network' and developing the necessary middleware to support a set of new and essential requirements for rapid data exchange, and a high level of interactivity in large-scale scientific collaborations. These include a set of tunable, scalable differentiated network services adapted to each of the data streams associated with a large number of collaborative sessions, policy-based and network state-based resource scheduling, authentication, and optional encryption to maintain confidentiality of <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications.</b> High performance testbed video networks will be established in ESnet and Internet 2 to test and tune the implementation, using a few target application-sets...|$|E
40|$|This thesis begins {{from the}} premise that public spheres are {{currently}} disappearing and losing their social role in the city; it focuses on traditional marketplaces in Seoul, Korea. Its aim is to explore the possibilities for re-designing traditional marketplaces, {{so that they can}} better serve not only their economic role but also become proper public spaces in the city. Although Korea has achieved an impressive economic, social and cultural developmental progress, traditional marketplaces have been lagging and declining, including Namdaemun market district. The prospective of current large-scale traditional market system faces challenges with the volatile consumer consumption patterns and less visitations to these markets. Besides, the 50 -years-old market buildings do not cope well in the busy market streets, which can barely handle problems brought by more stalls and a larger number of visitors. This thesis will start with a conceptual framework for comprehending the current situations, exploring the potential of traditional marketplaces in Seoul, and seeking architectural solutions to the absence of the 'public realm' With these solutions, It will be suggested some changes that are needed in the 'place' {{in order to meet the}} requirements of the present day trends and people's preferences. The thesis suggests that a new version of the traditional marketplace can be developed, that is combined with other programs, especially tourism spots, and that are better adapted to meeting modern requirements. It will focus on meeting social demands and fixing market problems, thereby reviving its own inherent competitive advantages as a space for commercial activities and <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications.</b> by Yu Jung Nam.

40|$|This paper show {{a process}} model for {{interpersonal}} activities concerning {{the reconstruction of}} R&D conceptual knowledge and have assessed its validity based on a case study. We applied the six-lenses model (Hayashi, 1999 : 2001 : 2004) to the knowledge reconstruction process in order to focusing on interaction personal perspective through <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications.</b> The six-lenses model consists six perspectives: subject, object, future, past, analog, and digital. Its process is based on interactions among the six perspectives and has three stages: (1) discussing the right position, by using questions such as “for what?” and “for who?,” (2) positively envisioning from a future perspective (2 -F) while identifying related known concepts and constructing concepts from a past perspective (2 -P), and (3) reconstructing the knowledge through practice from the future perspective based on the past consciousness (3 -F), while reconstructing the vision through practice from the past perspective based on future consciousness (3 -P). In addition, interactions between the subject and object perspectives and between the analog and digital perspectives occur in all stages. A case study of a particular on-going research team was tested our hypothetical model. Our observations and interview data indicate that the concepts of the research team’s members had developed through their knowledge reconstruction process. Based on this finding, we determined that our hypothetical model was partially valid. We also indicate four prior conditions {{that have to be}} met for the knowledge reconstruction process to work well: (1) members need to resolve personal issues based on a wealth of field experience and mature research competency, (2) members need to be in trusting relationships, (3) members need effective support of senior managers and advisers, and (4) members need high expectations from related teams.

40|$|Description of Intervention: PSI's LaSky program {{targeting}} MSM {{combines the}} distribution of informational and motivational materials to the target group with outreach activities, "edutainment" group sessions and <b>inter-personal</b> <b>communications</b> delivered by trained peer educators and opinion leaders. LaSky also supports an internet site with information, and a counseling telephone hotline. Methodology: The baseline survey in 2006 used time-location sampling; due to low response rates the follow-up in 2008 used respondent-driven sampling (RDS). Sample size was calculated for all the regions together. The baseline was a single-stage cluster sample, with locations where MSM congregate defined as clusters. The number of respondents to be selected was proportionate to cluster size. In every region the {{estimates of the number}} of MSM per cluster were calculated as a part of mapping exercise conducted prior to data collection. The follow-up in 2008 used the clusters defined in 2006 to select seeds (initial respondents). In large metropolitan centers (where the estimated number of total MSM in more than 20, 000) four recruitment waves were completed. In smaller locations the estimated number of MSM is below 10, 000, and three recruitment waves were completed. A total of 539 and 1113 interviews respectively were completed for the baseline and follow-up studies. Analyses consisted of logistic regression and anovas to examine trends over time, to ascertain which determinants are correlated with key behaviors, and to examine the association between program exposure and changes in health behaviors and determinants. Socio-demographic characteristics and geographic location were controlled for in the analyses. Main Findings The monitoring table highlights that: The share of respondents who report having relationships with a permanent partner has reached 82. 0 %, up from 68. 3 % two years ago (p value less than. 001). Yet the number of respondents reporting having casual partners has also increased (p value less than. 05), which suggests that MSM tend to maintain multiple sexual relationships at any given time. Condom use is far from being universal and varies by type of partner. In 2008, condom use at last sex with casual partners was 66. 8 %, and it was only 44. 1 % with permanent partners. The findings show a significant improvement in condom use among casual partners over time, but no change in condom use with permanent partners. The results of segmentation analysis indicate that the probability of MSM using condom during last contact with male partner increases with availability of free condoms. Almost 85 % of those practicing safe sex report having received condoms for free, the respective figure for non-users is 77 % (p value less than. 01). Thus, the availability of free condoms encourages MSM to use condoms. Self-efficacy to discuss condom use. MSM who are confident in their ability to discuss condom use with different types of partners are more likely to use condoms at last sex with a male partner. The respective means are 2. 86 for users and 2. 58 for non-users (p value less than. 001). Perception of condoms making sex less pleasant. Predictably, respondents who disagree with the statement "condoms make sex less pleasant" are more likely to use condoms than those who subscribe to this notion (45 % vs. 30. 2 %, respectively, p value less than. 001). The results of evaluation analysis reveal that PSI program exposure is associated with: An increase in condom use with casual partners as well as commercial partners (p value less than. 05). A greater likelihood of being tested for STIs (p value less than. 05). Increased confidence to negotiate condom use with different types of partners, being better informed about the requirement for HIV test being accompanied by pre-and post-test counseling, and knowing that it is not possible to tell by looking if a person has an STI (p value less than. 05). A higher perception of being at risk for HIV (p value less than. 05). There was no effect on the perception that condoms make sex less pleasant...|$|E
