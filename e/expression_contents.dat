40|$|Aim. In this study, we {{aimed to}} {{investigate}} the effects of febuxostat, a novel inhibitor of xanthine oxidase (XO), on renal damage in streptozotocin- (STZ-) induced diabetic rats. Methods. Diabetes was induced by the intraperitoneal injection of STZ in male Sprague-Dawley rats. Sham-injected rats served as controls. The control and diabetic rats were treated with and without febuxostat for 8 weeks, respectively. Fasting blood and 24 -h urine samples were collected every 4 weeks. Rat livers were extracted for detecting gene <b>expression,</b> <b>content,</b> and bioactivity of XO. Results. Diabetic rats showed significantly increased serum uric acid (SUA), serum creatinine (SCr), and urea nitrogen (BUN) levels. Daily urinary albumin (UAE), uric acid (UUA), and creatinine (UCr) excretion were also significantly increased in these rats. In diabetic rats, at week 8, febuxostat decreased SUA by 18. 9 %, while UAA was increased by 52. 0 %. However, UCr and urinary urea nitrogen (UUN) levels remained unchanged, while SCr and BUN levels decreased by > 30 % in these rats. Although hepatic gene <b>expression,</b> <b>content,</b> and activity of XO increased significantly in diabetic rats, febuxostat only slightly decreased its content. Conclusions. Febuxostat significantly attenuated renal damage in STZ-induced diabetic rats in addition to exerting hypouricemic effect...|$|R

The proposed method eliminates the requirement of a registered neutral image of the same subject whose expression is to be recognized. Thereby, provides a way for application of difference-image methods in expression recognition to any unknown subject.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of endurance training status and sex differences on skeletal muscle Na+,K+-pump mRNA <b>expression,</b> <b>content</b> and activity. Methods: Forty-five endurance-trained males (ETM), 11 recreationally active males (RAM), and nine recreationally active females (RAF) underwent a vastus lateralis muscle biopsy. Muscle was analysed for Na+,K+-pump α 1, α 2, α 3, β 1, β 2 and β 3 isoform mRNA expression (real-time reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction), content ([3 H]-ouabain-binding site) and maximal activity (3 - O-methylfluorescein phosphatase, 3 - O-MFPase). Results: ETM demonstrated lower α 1, α 3, β 2 and β 3 mRNA expression by 74 %, 62 %, 70 % and 82 %, respectively, than RAM (P < 0. 04). In contrast, [3 H]-ouabain binding and 3 - O-MFPase activity were each higher in ETM than in RAM, by 16 % (P < 0. 03). RAM demonstrated a 230 % and 364 % higher α 3 and β 3 mRNA expression than RAF, respectively (P < 0. 05), but no significant sex differences were found for α 1, α 2, β 1 or β 2 mRNA, [3 H]-ouabain binding or 3 - O-MFPase activity. No significant correlation was found between years of endurance training and either [3 H]-ouabain binding or 3 - O-MFPase activity. Significant but weak correlations {{were found between the}} number of training hours per week and 3 - O-MFPase activity (r = 0. 31, P < 0. 02) and between incremental exercise O 2 (peak) and both [3 H]-ouabain binding (r = 0. 33, P < 0. 01) and 3 - O-MFPase activity (r = 0. 28, P < 0. 03).

Methods Within {{the context of a}} case-control study designed to address surgical risk of sporadic Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease in Nordic European countries (EUROSURGYCJD Project), a strategy was adopted to categorise reported surgical procedures in terms of potential risk of Creutzfeldt-Jakob Disease acquisition.

50|$|Hjelmslev's sign {{model is}} a {{development}} of Saussure's bilateral sign model. Saussure considered a sign as having two sides, signifier and signified. Hjelmslev's famously renamed signifier and signified as respectively <b>expression</b> plane and <b>content</b> plane, and also distinguished between form and substance. The combinations of the four would distinguish between form of <b>content,</b> form of <b>expression,</b> substance of <b>content,</b> and substance of expression. In Hjelmslev's analysis, a sign is a function between two forms, the content form and the expression form, {{and this is the}} starting point of linguistic analysis. However, every sign function is also manifested by two substances: the content substance and the <b>expression</b> substance. The <b>content</b> substance is the psychical and conceptual manifestation of the sign. The expression substance is the physical substance wherein a sign is manifested. This substance can be sound, as is the case for most known languages, but it can be any material support whatsoever, for instance, hand movements, as is the case for sign languages, or distinctive marks on a suitable medium as in the many different writing systems of the world.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Tensism is {{the view}} that tense {{is not merely a}} {{property}} of language and the mind (narrowly individuated), but of the world itself. Perspectivalism extends this idea to all perspectival properties be they person (e. g. first person vs. second) or locational (e. g. here vs there). One challenge that perspectivalism faces is the problem of expressing the contents of the beliefs and utterances of persons that are in other perspectival positions. One proposed solution to this problem is to allow for semantic theories that "realign" the <b>expression</b> of <b>contents</b> so that the contents expressed by persons in other perspectival positions can be re-expressed from one's own perspectival position. In this paper I argue that a similar semantic realignment strategy could be deployed in helping perspectivalists generally (and presentists in particular) come to grips with a puzzle raised by the Special Theory of Relativity. In short, the strategy is to realign the <b>expression</b> of <b>contents</b> in another inertial frame so that they are expressed from within your inertial frame. As we will see, the strategy is not puzzle free...|$|R

Proteins of MUC 5 AC and &# 946;-catenin, Cyclin D 1, NF-&# 954;B p 65 were detected by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), reverse transcription (RT) -PCR and western blotting assays.
