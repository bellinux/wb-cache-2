In 1635 a state letter monopoly formally came into being and the public institution of the Post Office was created. It was used to raise revenues to sponsor state activities including war. The King's proclamation dated at Bagshot on 31 July 1635 which established the letter-office required Witherings to [...] "settle a running post or two to run day and night between Edinburgh and Scotland and the City of London, to go thither and come back in six days".

Witherings opened the first post office at Bishopsgate Street in October 1635. The King charged Witherings with building six [...] "Great Roads" [...] to aid in the delivery of the post, of which the Great West Road was one. Postmasters on each road were required to provide horses for the mail at 2½d a mile and a conveyance tariff was fixed. Postage was paid on receipt of the letter by the addressee.
