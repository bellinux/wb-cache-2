5|$|When the First World War {{began in}} 1914, both of Gardiner's {{brothers}} enlisted and were sent overseas. Gardiner's father John also enlisted, but he died May 30, 1916 {{before he was}} sent overseas. Both his brothers returned home after the war ended; while Alex was unharmed, John {{had been involved in}} a poison gas attack, and was seriously ill. To help provide for the family Gardiner began working for the J.H. Ashdown Hardware Company at the age of twelve. In December 1928 John began to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> {{as a result of his}} poison gas attack in the war, and died December 13. Edith had planned to get married on December 31, but wanted to delay the marriage because of John's death, though her family convinced her to continue with the original plan. Gardiner married Myrtle Brooks August 6, 1927 at Grace United Church in Winnipeg. Their first son, Robert Roy, was born May 20, 1929. They also had a girl on May 7, 1931, but she died the same day.|$|E

5000|$|Even though Domestic Medicine was {{groundbreaking}} in many areas, {{many of its}} theories {{were still}} grounded in humorism. Buchan was a strong advocate for letting nature take its course and resetting the patient to the natural set point. Like {{a large number of}} physicians at the time, Buchan was also a strong proponent of bloodletting and purging as cures. The belief was that if the body could eject the infections, it would return to its natural point. Buchan also advocated for careful tracking of the non-naturals (air, meat and drink, sleeping and watching, exercise and quiet, evacuations and obstructions, and passions). Too much of one would result in an imbalance and make a person more likely to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Buchan {{experienced}} wider exposure than Tissot because Buchan addressed new areas, such as industrial diseases. The {{writing of}} Domestic Medicine took place near {{the start of}} the industrial revolution and resounded with the industrial workers. Generally, these industrial diseases and cures suffered from secondhand observations rather than more stringent clinical observation; however, they held the promise of health and garnered general support. Domestic Medicine also {{was one of the first}} texts to not only discuss potential cures to diseases, but also to strongly emphasize prevention. In fact, the first third of the text is dedicated how to prevent a number of diseases. Buchan also emphasized a strict regimen of hygiene and cleanliness that extended into morality. Buchan argued that immoral people were much more likely to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness.</b>|$|E

50|$|When science becomes {{religion}} and the scientists become priests the humankind starts a new age of totalitarianism of science. The reality of the Almighty God, Creator and Redeemer, is no more recognized by post-modern man, who now adopt the performativity and lucrativity as a new dogma of scientific religion. Predestination is no more a Christian dogma but a concept of biotechnology. The scientist can see, as a small-great-god, who is predestined by the genetic code to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness,</b> like a cancer. Therefore the scientist became the one who can choose life or death for a new life under formation.88There are many risks on see the science as a religion. Or to put the science as criteria of truth, specially this kind of science that has on post-modern thinking its epistemological base. The practice of get patents of living being its one {{of these kinds of}} risks. When an economical group has the patent of a soy bean, than the farmers cannot produce soy without pay royalties to the company that has the patent rights. So poor people at south countries will have their free access to seeds for planting not allowed, in consequence they will not have food for their countries.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} representations about smoking and practices related to patient smoking among staff {{of a large}} public psychiatric hospital. A survey was performed using a specially designed questionnaire. The return rate was 72. 4 % (n = 155). A large proportion of staff {{recognized the importance of}} both smoking status and mental health for patient's well-being (46. 9 %), and believed that smoking cessation was possible for psychiatric patients (58. 6 %). However, the role of the psychiatric hospital was perceived as providing information (85. 3 %) and helping to diminish cigarette consumption (51 %), rather than proposing smoking cessation (29. 5 %). Staff daily practice included reminding patients of smoking restrictions (43. 9 %), managing cigarettes (46. 5 %), and nicotine replacement therapy (24. 3 %). A principal component analysis of tobacco-related practices revealed two main factors (59. 8 % of variance) : basic hospital actions (factor 1) and more specialized interventions (factor 2), which were significantly associated with higher worries about personally developing smoke-related illnesses (Spearman r = 0. 38, P < 0. 0001). Compared with non-smokers, smokers reported higher perceived vulnerability to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> due to tobacco and a higher level of worry about this. The discussion highlights the need to redefine roles and expectancies of mental health staff, and improve training and collaboration with experts, in order to improve efficiency concerning tobacco issues...|$|E
40|$|Case: Ms. B, a 70 -year {{old woman}} {{diagnosed}} with Stage IV (T 3 N 3 M 1 b) non-small cell lung cancer, {{has experienced a}} decline in her Palliative Performance Score to 40 %, and most recently developed deep venous thrombosis. Prior to her diagnosis of lung cancer, she met with her attorney and completed an advance directive, formally designating her brother as her healthcare surrogate, and indicating in writing she wanted no CPR should she <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> for which {{there would be no}} improvement and an ever worsening status. At the time of completing her advance directive, she hoped to live a long and healthy life, and couldnâ€™t picture the experience of a terminal illness, so she didnâ€™t indicate any further wishes. Now, however, after meeting with her oncologist and the primary care physician, she realizes that state-of-the art therapies have failed to improve her health, and understands her survival is limited to probably less than 6 months. She has elected community-based hospice care, and wants to make some additional specific choices regarding the medical aspects of her own end-of-life care. In response, her physician (who has determined she is capable of making her own decisions) asks her if she has heard of POLST.

40|$|Rapid {{scientific}} advances, such {{as those}} in biomarker technology, have made {{a significant impact on the}} ethics and practice of occupational health. Biomarkers are extensively used in occupational health practice. In the pre-employment stage, preventive or predictive testing can be performed. Preventive testing aims to avert accidents that may occur if a medically unfit worker undertakes a job that he is unable to perform. For safety sensitive jobs, routine testing of a worker's functional capacity in the actual job would suffice in most cases. However, a recently quotes application of a test is the screening for mutations of the cardiac myosin-heavy chain and troponin genes among asymptomatic persons with a family history of sudden death from hypertrophic obstructive cardiomyopathy. Predictive testing hopes to forecast the risk of a worker developing an illness. The aims may vary. One aim may be to exclude a susceptible worker from working in a hazardous environment. Another aim may be to avoid employment of a worker who is likely to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> which could lead to higher employer health care costs. A pertinent question to consider is whether the test undertaken is to benefit the individual or to fulfil some administrative or financial need. Among exposed workers, screening may be conducted for biomarkers of exposure or effect. As the aim is to prevent the onset of clinical illness, the physician must take responsibility for initiating requests for screening. The appropriate response to the effect of technical and societal advances on ethics is the updating of ethical guidelines by the profession. However, in the context of unvalidated biomarkers being used for screening, it may be necessary to require a regulatory body to ensure that the tests are accurate and effective, and that they are not used to discriminate against individuals...|$|E

40|$|The era {{prior to}} 1990 {{was a time}} of careful {{observation}} of disease presentation, course, outcomes and meticulous pathology studies. These mainly single-centre studies introduced new life-saving therapies for drugs still used effectively today. In the 1970 â€“ 1980 s, cyclophosphamide (CyP) added to glucocorticosteroids (GCS) was shown to be life-saving. The trade-off was often severe adverse events. Some forms of vasculitis were found not as ominous as thought initially. Some could be treated with safer drugs [e. g. methotrexate (MTX) ]. However, whether mild or severe, patients were not cured. From 1990 to the present large collaborative networks have provided studies were not possible heretofore. Randomized controlled trials captured and manipulated vast amounts of data, banked biological specimens and shared these resources and intellectual capital, moving the field forward at an extraordinary pace. We now know that even for severe forms of granulomatosis and polyangiitis [granulomatosis with polyangiitis (GPA), Wegener's granulomatosus (WG) ], microscopic polyangiitis (MPA) and Churgâ€“Strauss syndrome (CSS), we do not need to use CyP for extended periods. We have learned recently that rituximab is as effective as CyP for severe WG and MPA. We should never again see the permanent toxicities born from years of chronic CyP use. However, short courses of CyP remain useful and can be life-saving. Step-down therapy from CyP is now a standard of care, perhaps to be replaced by rituximab in the future. If one accepts the premise that there are few cures at present for idiopathic large- and small-vessel vasculitis, we will serve our patients well if we can determine the most effective initial therapy that leads to a maintenance strategy for remission with least risk. Ultimately, we wish to identify causes of vasculitis so they {{can be used as a}} wedge to secure cures. Unmet needs and strategies are as follows: (1) to increase the numbers of vasculitis-trained physicians; (2) to define riskâ€“benefit formulae for chronic maintenance therapy versus discontinuation of treatment after remission; (3) to define riskâ€“ and costâ€“benefit formulae for laboratory monitoring; (4) large-scale studies with longer follow-up that explore inhibition of interleukin- 5 in CSS; (5) to explore the value of anti-interferon-Î³ for GCA, Takayasu's and other granulomatous vasculitides; and (6) identification of aetiological factors: cures will probably be linked to knowledge of the antigen driving the disease, plus vulnerabilities of the patient that prepare them to <b>develop</b> <b>an</b> <b>illness</b> phenotype. Improved outcomes using anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive agents do not rule out infection as a driver for autoimmunity. Techniques that can facilitate pathogen discovery have never been more sophisticated...|$|E
