40|$|Article first {{published}} online: 17 FEB 2014 A base index involving Striga damage, number of emerged Striga plantsand ears per plant is used <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>for</b> maize (Zea mays L.) grainyield under Striga infestation. There are contradictory {{reports on the}} reliabilityof number of emerged Striga plants <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>for</b> Striga resistance. The objective {{of this study was}} to confirm reliability of thesecondary traits <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>for</b> improved grain yield under Striga infestation. Ten Striga-resistant extra-early cultivars were evaluated for 3 years under artificial Striga-infested and Striga-free environments inNigeria. Analysis of variance combined across years and locationsshowed significant mean squares for genotype, year, location and theirinteractions for most traits. Sequential path analysis identified ear aspectas the only trait with significant direct effect on yield under artificialStriga infestation, while GGE biplot confirmed ear aspect, ears per plantand Striga damage as the most reliable traits. Ear aspect should beincluded in the base index <b>for</b> <b>selecting</b> <b>for</b> improved grain yield ofextra-early maize under Striga infestation, while the number of emergedStriga plants should be excluded.

According to Cecil, the Director's Cut came about thanks to a group of Broken Sword fans, who started an online petition begging him to bring the series to the Wii and DS. The game starts a day before the Parisian cafe explosion in the original game, filling in some of Nicole Collard's back-story. Dave Gibbons, with whom Revolution worked previously on their 1994 cult classic adventure Beneath a Steel Sky, worked on visual references for the game; He also produced a comic book to accompany the game's DS release. In the Director's Cut, Hazel Ellerby returns to voice Nicole Collard in the new sections, playing Nico again {{for the first time since}} the original game's release.
