40|$|Objective To {{explore the}} {{clinical}} and pathological features of congenital hepatic fibrosis with Caroli’s disease. Methods The clinical characteristics of 6 patients with congenital hepatic fibrosis and Caroli’s disease were analyzed,and the histological features of hepatic tissue were observed by using hematoxylin and eosin staining and histochemical staining. Results The {{mean age of}} the 6 patients was 7. 8 years,and the sex ratio(male to female) was 2 : 4. The main clinical manifestations were hematemesis(5 / 6),hypodynamia(5 / 6) and hepatosplenomegaly(5 / 6). Three of the 6 patients were complicated with portal hypertension, 2 cases complicated with <b>diffuse</b> <b>parenchyma</b> lesion in the double kidneys,and 1 case showed abnormal hepatic function. The main histological features were fibrosis of periportal area,epithelial tissue proliferation of interfibrous bile ducts,capsular ectasia of intrahepatic bile ducts,cholestasis and inflammatory infiltration. Pseudolobule formation in hepatic tissue may observed,but most of the hepatic plates arranged still in order. Conclusions Congenital hepatic fibrosis with Caroli’s disease is presented in adolescent. The diagnosis of the disease is mainly based on periportal fibrosis and capsular ectasia of intrahepatic bile ducts combined with clinical data...|$|E
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for secondary xylem of 14 species of four genera of Calyceraceae; root wood is studied for acaulescent perennials and one annual. The wood anatomy of most species of Calycera has character states {{identical to those}} seen in wood of most Asteraceae (including phylads of Asteraceae thought to be basic in that family). Goodeniaceae have two features (tracheids, <b>diffuse</b> <b>parenchyma)</b> more primitive than corresponding conditions in Asteraceae and CaIyceraceae according to traditional criteria. Diversity in wood anatomy within Calyceraceae is explainable in terms of adaptation to particular ecological conditions. Although woods of the family as a whole are xeromorphic, most Calycera species show few adaptations to extreme xeromorphy. The highest degree of wood xeromorphy occurs in species of relatively high elevation or high latitude. The presence of pseudoscalariform pitting, with transitions to helical-banded secondary xylem vessels, very much like those of primary xylem, in Boopis graminea and Nastanthus spp., coupled with absence of Iibriform fibers (replaced by axial parenchyma) are probably related to expansion and contraction of the wood in response to fluctuation in moisture availability...|$|E
40|$|Anatomical  and Physical Properties of Mindi Wood (Melia azedarach Linn) from Community Forest in Yogyakarta Information about mindi wood {{characteristics}} is {{very limited}} while utilisation of this wood on our society is very extensive. Better knowledge on anatomical and physical wood properties of mindi wood optimizes its utilization. Therefore, this study aims to identify anatomical (macroscopic and microscopic) and physical (moisture content, specific gravity and dimensional changes) wood properties of mindi taken from community forests around Yogyakarta. The macroscopic structural characteristics results showed that annual ring appeared clearly at transversal surface, having single vessel, vasicentric and <b>diffuse</b> <b>parenchyma,</b> rough texture, straight fiber direction, and no resin canal. Cell proportion of wood showed that fibers occupy more than 44 %, followed by vessel (20 %), parenchyma (19 %) and rays (15 %). Wood fiber dimension showed fiber length of 0. 83 mm, fiber diameter of 14. 57 µ, and cell wall thickness of 2. 50 µ. Physical wood properties showed that mindi has 31 % moisture content and 0. 416 of basic specific gravity. Wood shrinkage from green to kilndry on longitudinal was 3. 94 %, tangensial 5. 74 %, and radial 2. 60 %, with T/R ratio 2. 38. Based on T/R ratio value, mindi wood is not recommended for wood construction due to its low dimensional stability. Furthermore, mindi wood also has high longitudinal wood shrinkage and low specific gravity indicating juvenility...|$|E

40|$|Aim: Interstitial lung {{diseases}} are {{a group of}} diseases which have similar radiological and clinical findings and characterized with <b>diffuse</b> <b>parenchyma</b> infiltration. Surgical lung biopsy is performed for many years due to difficulties in definitive diagnosis of the diseases. However, risk of surgery related mortality and morbidity, developments in minimal invasive and radiological examinations are led us to review the role of surgical biopsy for interstitial lung diseases. In this study the patients with suspect of interstitial lung disease were evaluated in terms of the diagnostic value and the risk of surgical lung biopsy. Material and Method: The patients who underwent surgical lung biopsies for interstitial lung diseases were evaluated in this retrospective clinical study. Forty-five consecutive patients (17 female, 28 male; aged between 20 - 78 years, mean age was 50. 45) were referred to our clinic for histopathological diagnosis. The surgical approach was wedge resection of the suspected lung parenchyma under general anesthesia on lateral decubitus position. Surgical biopsies were done via video assisted thoracoscopic surgery in 31 patients and via thoracotomy in 14 patients. Clinical outcomes were compared according to the risks and diagnostic value of the surgical biopsies (patient’s characteristics, surgical methods, number of the specimens and change in treatment). Results: A total of 47 surgical lung biopsies were performed on 45 patients with suspected interstitial lung diseases. Definitive diagnosis was obtained in 82 % (n= 37) of the patients. Most common diagnosis was idiopathic interstitial pneumonia (40 %; n= 18). Pathological diagnosis could not be achieved in 18 % of the cases. Operation related mortality was 4. 4 % (n= 2) and morbidity was 18 % (n= 8). Diagnostic value of single field lung biopsy was 77 %, while the ratio was 94 % in 2 fields lung biopsies (p= 0. 169). Morbidity was significantly higher in advanced age (mean 66. 8 years) (p= 0. 002). The surgical procedures, VATS and thoracotomy, were compared in operation time, hospitalization, complication rates, and diagnostic value. VATS was superior in mean hospitalization (6. 1 days vs. 3. 7 days) and operation time (75 min vs. 45 min) (p= 0. 005). There was no difference in complication rate and diagnostic value of the surgical methods. Discussion: Surgical lung biopsy has an important role in differential diagnosis of interstitial lung diseases. Both thoracotomy and VATS are very safe and effective methods for lung biopsy because of low mortality and morbidity rates and high diagnostic value. However VATS is superior to thoracotomy with shorter hospitalization and operation time. Advanced age and need for mechanical ventilation should be considered as the major risk factors for surgical biopsy candidates...|$|E
40|$|Fossil {{angiosperm}} {{wood from}} Upper Cretaceous sediments of Livingston Island and James Ross Island {{in the northern}} Antarctic Peninsula region is identified as having the combination of anatomical characters most similar to modern Cunoniaceae. The material is characterised by predominantly solitary vessels, opposite to scalariform intervessel pitting, scalariform perforation plates, heterocellular multiseriate and homocellular uniseriate rays, <b>diffuse</b> axial <b>parenchyma.</b> Anatomically, the specimens conform most closely to the fossil organ genus Weinmannioxylon Petriella which has been placed within the Cunoniaceae. The presence of Weinmannioxylon in Late Cretaceous sediments suggests that taxa within or stem taxa to the Cunoniaceae {{might have been a}} notable component of the forest vegetation that covered the Antarctic Peninsula during the Late Mesozoic and may therefore represent the earliest record of this family...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work is the {{description}} of the wood anatomy of Blepharocalyx salicifolius (H. B. K.) Berg (Myrtaceae). There were collected 6 samples of wood, three from Serra do Sudeste and the others from Campos de Cima da Serra - RS. The wood microtechnique followed the standard procedures used in the Wood Anatomy Laboratory of the Federal University of Paraná. For the maceration of wood sticks, the Jeffrey method was used. The wood anatomy agrees, in general lines, with the typical standard of this family, congregating a large number of narrow and solitary vessels, with simple perforation plates, besides <b>diffuse</b> apotracheal <b>parenchyma,</b> heterogeneous rays and bordered pit fibres.

40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} features are reported for mature wood and bark of {{two species of}} Kadsura and five species of Schisandra. Newly reported for the family are predominance of simple perforation plates (all species); presence of pit membrane remnants in vessels of first-formed secondary xylem; two to three series of pits per facet on tracheids; <b>diffuse</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> (Kadsura); multiseri- ate rays more than three cells wide at the widest point (all species); ethereal oil cells in axial xylem; and certain details of comparative bark anatomy. Differences in wood anatomy between Illiciaceae and Schisandraceae are nearly all differences of degree. These differences relate to the shrubby to arboreal habit in Illicium {{as opposed to the}} scandent habits in Schisandraceae. Larger pits on tracheids, wider and shorter vessel elements, and a high figure for conductive area per mm 2 of transection are features related to the scandent habit of Schisandraceae; opposing character states in Illicium relate to the self-supporting nature of growth forms in that genus...|$|R
30|$|It {{is noted}} that, {{including}} the type species Brachyoxylon notabile Hollick et Jeffrey, many Brachyoxylon species (e.g., B. trautii (Barale) Philippe, B. liebermanii Philippe, B. avramii Iamandei et Iamandei, B. dobrogiacum Iamandei et Iamandei, B. semibiseriatum (Pant et Singh) Kurzawe et Merlotti, and B. serrae Philippe et al.) {{are characterized by}} having tangential tracheid pitting and/or traumatic resin ducts (Table 1). Nevertheless, neither tangential tracheid pitting nor traumatic resin ducts are observed in Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. Being different from the new species from China, Brachyoxylon currumilii from the Lower–Middle Jurassic of Argentina bears scanty and <b>diffuse</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> (Bodnar et al. 2013). Another Argentina species, Brachyoxylon baqueroensis differs from the new species by having distinct annual rings, triseriate radial pits, and a higher number of cross-field pits (Vera and Césari 2015). Generally, Brachyoxylon zhejiangense sp. nov. {{seems to be more}} comparable to B. woodworthianum Torrey (mid-Cretaceous, North America) in ray height, obscure annual rings, and the absence of tangential tracheid pitting and parenchyma; however, original description of B. woodworthianum shows that it has traumatic resin canals and abietan pitting in traumatic ray cells (Torrey 1923).|$|R

30|$|Our {{case report}} is {{extremely}} unusual given {{the presence of}} lung and thyroid metastases at diagnosis. However, cases with concomitant oncocytomas and renal-cell cancers have been reported (Licht et al. 1993; Dechet et al. 1999), especially if there are <b>diffuse</b> nodules involving <b>parenchyma</b> in the same or contralateral kidney, {{as in the case}} described. We acknowledge that the histological analysis of thyroid metastasis only described the compatibility with renal origin without confirming the oncocytic nature, and no histological confirmation of the nodules in the contralateral kidney was available. Furthermore, histological diagnosis of oncocytoma may be difficult, and cases of chromophobe renal-cell cancer described as metastatic oncocytomas have been reported. Both oncocytomas and chromophobe renal-cell cancer derive from the intercalating cells of distal renal tubules, and their similar histologic features make it difficult to distinguish them, thus leading to possible misdiagnosis (Chao et al. 2002; Van der Kwast and Perez-Ordonez 2007).|$|R
40|$|One of {{the iconic}} fossils of the John Day Fossil Beds National Monument, Oregon, USA, is the Hancock Tree—a permineralized {{standing}} tree stump about 0. 5 m {{in diameter and}} 2. 5 m in height, embedded in a lahar of the Clarno Formation of middle Eocene age. We examined the wood anatomy of this stump, together with other permineralized woods and leaf impressions from the same stratigraphic level, to {{gain an understanding of}} the vegetation intercepted by the lahar. Wood of the Hancock Tree is characterized by narrow and numerous vessels, exclusively scalariform perforation plates, exclusively uniseriate rays, and <b>diffuse</b> axial <b>parenchyma.</b> These features and the type of vessel-ray parenchyma indicate affinities with the Hamamelidaceae, with closest similarity to the Exbucklandoideae, which is today native to Southeast and East Asia. The Hancock Tree is but one of at least 48 trees entombed in the same mudflow; 14 others have anatomy similar to the Hancock Tree; 20 have anatomy similar to Platanoxylon haydenii (Platanaceae), two resemble Scottoxylon eocenicum (probably in order Urticales). The latter two wood types occur in the nearby Clarno Nut Beds. Two others are distinct types of dicots, one with features seen in the Juglandaceae, the other of unknown affinities, and the rest are very poorly preserved and of unknown affinity. Leaf impressions in and immediately below the layer containing the trees include the extinct genera Macginitiea and Platimeliphyllum (Platanaceae), and Trochodendroides (Saxifragales) ...|$|R
40|$|Qualitative and {{quantitative}} data are presented for wood of all species of Fouquieriaceae, the samples selected {{so as to}} cover important variables with respect to organography and age. Wood contains fibertracheids (plus a few vasicentric tracheids). <b>Diffuse</b> axial <b>parenchyma</b> is mostly grouped as diffuse-in-aggregates or diffuse clusters (new term), with transitions to pervasive axial parenchyma in some species. Rays are Heterogeneous Type II. These wood features are relatively unspecialized and are consistent with placement {{of the family in}} Ericales s. 1. as defined in recent DNA-based cladograms. Xeromorphic wood in nonsucculent species occurs only in Fouquieria shrevei; the lateral branches of F. columnaris also have xeromorphic wood. If the preceding two instances and proliferated parenchyma of the three succulent species (F. columnaris, F. fasciculata, and F. purpusii) are excluded from quantitative studies, wood of Fouquieriaceae is rather mesomorphic, despite the habitats occupied by the family. This paradox is explained by the very sensitive drought deciduousness. Also, the succulent species produce water-storage parenchyma by means of expansion of rays and axial parenchyma bands. Details of these two types of meristems, as well as three other types of meristems within wood (not including vascular cambium) and four bark meristems (other than phellogen) are described; five of these meristems are newly reported for the family. Wood data permit recognition of both the three succulent and eight nonsucculent species within a single genus, in agreement with Henrickson (1972), but few wood features offer species characters. Most wood features, including the abundant reaction wood, are closely related to habit, organography, and ecology...|$|R
40|$|Objective: In cardiac {{magnetic}} resonance imaging (CMR), incidental pathological findings are frequently found outside the investigated cardiovascular system. Some of these findings might have clinical implications. The {{aim of this study}} was to determine the prevalence of incidental extracardiac findings (ECF) in CMR and their clinical significance. Methods: A total of 4165 CMR reports from 2009 - 2012 were retrospectively reviewed for ECF. Two hundred-twenty reports with ECF were found. For each case, we obtained information on sex, age of the patient, reported ECF and radiologist recommendation. Follow-up data were analyzed by reviewing available electronic medical records. ECF was considered clinically significant if there was an associated diagnosis, additional treatment or further investigations in the clinical follow-up data. Results: In total, 356 ECF were recorded in 220 (5. 3 %) CMR reports. Sixty (23. 7 %) of the 253 ECF with follow-up data available were clinically significant. The most prevalent ECF were pleural effusions (n= 54), kidney cysts (n= 54), <b>diffuse</b> lung <b>parenchyma</b> changes (n= 33) and liver cysts (n= 29). Adrenal pathology (n= 3, 100 % significant), renal masses (n= 3, 100 %) and pulmonary masses (n= 5, 62. 5 %) were the most clinically significant ECF. Although prevalence of these ECF was low, they were significant particularly frequently. When radiologist recommendations for further investigation were present in the report, the frequency of clinically significant ECF was higher compared to reports with no further investigation recommended (p< 0. 001). Conclusion: In this study, ECF in CMR were reported not very commonly (5. 3 %). A substantial part of ECF was clinically significant, changing patient diagnosis or management, with an overall prevalence of 1. 3 %...|$|R

40|$|Gliomas form a {{heterogeneous}} group of {{tumors of the}} central nervous system (CNS) and are traditionally classified based on histologic type and malignancy grade. Most gliomas, the diffuse gliomas, show extensive infiltration in the CNS <b>parenchyma.</b> <b>Diffuse</b> gliomas can be further typed as astrocytic, oligodendroglial, or rare mixed oligodendroglial-astrocytic of World Health Organization (WHO) grade II (low grade), III (anaplastic), or IV (glioblastoma). Other gliomas generally have a more circumscribed growth pattern, with pilocytic astrocytomas (WHO grade I) and ependymal tumors (WHO grade I, II, or III) as the most frequent representatives. This chapter provides an overview of the histology of all glial neoplasms listed in the WHO 2016 classification, including the less frequent "nondiffuse" gliomas and mixed neuronal-glial tumors. For multiple decades the histologic diagnosis of these tumors formed a useful basis for assessment of prognosis and therapeutic management. However, it is now fully clear that information on the molecular underpinnings often allows for a more robust classification of (glial) neoplasms. Indeed, in the WHO 2016 classification, histologic and molecular findings are integrated in the definition of several gliomas. As such, this chapter and Chapter 6 are highly interrelated and neither should be considered in isolation...|$|R
40|$|One {{thousand}} {{six hundred}} and ninety-five inhabitants of 3 rural villages on Ukerewe Island, Lake Victoria, Tanzania, were examined by clinical, parasitological, ultrasonographic and [...] in part [...] serological means to evaluate Schistosoma (S.) mansoni-related morbidity on a community level. Villagers frequently complained of typical colitis symptoms (abdominal pain 80. 1 %, bloody stools 43. 1 %, diarrhoea 35. 1 %); haematemesis, {{on the other}} hand, was rare (and reports doubtful in most cases). 16. 9 % of the population had been given praziquantel previously. Overall S. mansoni prevalence was 86. 3 %, with a median egg output of 176 eggs per gram (e. p. g.) and maximum output of 17, 984 e. p. g. Children and adolescents were infected more severely than adults, men more severely than women. Pretreated individuals excreted significantly fewer ova (median 124 vs 192 e. p. g., P < 0. 001). Hepatomegaly (determined by ultrasonography) was present in 35 %, splenomegaly in 80 %. Organomegaly {{was significantly related to}} egg output. Pretreated persons had lower rates of splenomegaly and left lobe hepatomegaly. Low-degree periportal fibrosis was common, while severe grades of fibrosis (MANAGIL score II and III) were present in about 6 %. About 10 % had other abnormalities on liver sonography (irregular parenchymal texture and/or shape); these person passed significantly more S. mansoni ova than others. Clear sonographic signs of portal hypertension were seen in 2. 1 %. Serum procollagen-IV-peptide and gamma-glutamyl-transferase levels were increased in persons with severe periportal fibrosis, irregular liver texture of portofugal collateral vessels. Thus, S. mansoni infection {{in the western part of}} Ukerewe Island is frequent and often severe, leading to a high prevalence of gastrointestinal symptoms. Hepatosplenic involvement does occur, although symptomatic cases of portal hypertension were not identified beyond doubt. The overall level of schistosomal morbidity is thus considered intermediate. Serum procollagen-IV-peptide may be a promising marker of schistosomal liver disease. Our data suggest that S. mansoni infection may also be related to <b>diffuse</b> liver <b>parenchyma</b> alterations in this area...|$|R
40|$|The {{pathogenesis}} of neuromyelitis optica (NMO) involves binding of IgG autoantibodies (NMO-IgG) to aquaporin- 4 (AQP 4) on astrocytes in {{the central}} nervous system (CNS). We studied the in vivo processing in mice of a recombinant monoclonal human NMO-IgG that binds strongly to mouse AQP 4. Following intravenous administration, serum [NMO-IgG] decreased with t 1 / 2 ∼ 18 hours in wildtype mice and ∼ 41 hours in AQP 4 knockout mice. NMO-IgG was localized to AQP 4 -expressing cell membranes in kidney (collecting duct), skeletal muscle, trachea (epithelial cells) and stomach (parietal cells). NMO-IgG was seen on astrocytes in the area postrema in brain, but not elsewhere in brain, spinal cord, optic nerve or retina. Intravenously administered NMO-IgG was also seen in brain following mechanical disruption of the blood-brain barrier. Selective cellular localization was not found for control (non-NMO) IgG, or for NMO-IgG in AQP 4 knockout mice. NMO-IgG injected directly into brain <b>parenchyma</b> <b>diffused</b> over an area of ∼ 5 mm 2 over 24 hours and targeted astrocyte foot-processes. Our data establish NMO-IgG pharmacokinetics and tissue distribution in mice. The rapid access of serum NMO-IgG to AQP 4 in peripheral organs but not the CNS indicates that restricted antibody access cannot account for the absence of NMO pathology in peripheral organs...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To define {{timing and}} methods for a {{balanced}} follow-up of testicular microlithiasis (TM) in pediatric age. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We retrospectively reviewed medical records of 21 pediatric asymptomatic patients (42 testicular units) diagnosed with TM and without associated risk factors. Microliths were found bilaterally on ultrasonography in all the patients. Distribution of microliths (focal or <b>diffuse)</b> inside the <b>parenchyma</b> was evaluated {{as well as its}} eventual variation over time. Every six months, each patient underwent clinical and ultrasonography evaluation, as well as serum chemistry markers (α-fetoprotein and β-human chorionic gonadotropin) measurement to detect potential malignancy. In the interval between the follow-ups, parents and/or patients themselves were asked to control eventual enlargement of the gonads or scrotal swelling. Testicular biopsy was not performed in any of our subjects. RESULTS: Of 21 patients, 6 had unilateral undescended testis, 4 varicocele, and 1 patent processusvaginalis with scrotal swelling while 10 patients did not show associated anomalies. The distribution pattern of microliths on ultrasonography remained unchanged in all follow-ups in every patient, showing a predominance of diffuse pattern in the undescended testis series. Tumor markers remained within normal limits. In no subject, we observed a shift toward a malignant condition. CONCLUSION: In the pediatric population with an incidentally diagnosed TM and without any associated risk factor, a slight follow-up is suggested, consisting of clinical evaluation every 6 months, without any justifiable recommendation to perform a testis biopsy and a measurement of serum tumor markers...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{investigate}} the biological effects of galactic rays on astronaut cerebral functions after space flight, mice were exposed to different heavy ions (HZE) in whole-body conditions at doses comparable to the galactic flux: 12 C, 16 O and 20 Ne (95 MeV/u, at 42 – 76 mGy). Animals were also exposed to 42 mGy of 60 Co radiation for comparison with HZE. The neuroimmune response, evaluated by interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) measurement, showed that this cytokine was produced 3 h after irradiation by 16 O or 60 Co. In contrast, neither 12 C (56. 7 mGy) nor 20 Ne (76 mGy) induced IL- 1 production. However, immunohistochemical staining of 12 C-irradiated mouse brain tissue showed 2 months later a marked inflammatory reaction in the hippocampus and a <b>diffuse</b> response in <b>parenchyma.</b> Sleep studies were realized before and after exposure to 42 mGy of 16 O and 76 mGy of 20 Ne: only the 20 Ne radiation displayed a small effect. A slight decrease in paradoxical sleep, corresponding {{to a reduction in}} the number of episodes of paradoxical sleep, was manifested between 8 and 22 days after exposure. Exposure to 12 C and 16 O induced no changes either in cellularity of spleen or thymus, or in caspase 3 activity (as much as four months after irradiation). Taken together, these data indicate that the CNS could be sensitive to heavy ions and that responses to HZE impact depend on the nature of the particle, the dose threshold and the time delay to develop biological processes. Differences in responses to different HZE highlight the complex biological phenomena to which astronauts are submitted during space flight...|$|R
