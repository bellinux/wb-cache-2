50|$|The {{absence of}} <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulses</b> to {{facilitate}} interlace was defended {{at the start}} of the BBC service on the grounds that it only caused a lack of interlace with field synchronizing separators of the integrator type, and that there were, even at that time, numerous other circuits which gave completely accurate interlace without <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulses.</b> The question was raised again from time to time, but a series of tests, conducted during 1952 in cooperation with the British Radio Equipment Manufacturers' Association, confirmed that there was no general need for <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulses.</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract-In this paper, {{regional}} P-wave upper mantle {{structure is}} investigated using slant-stack velocity analysis of short-period earthquake data recorded at station MAJO (Matsushiro, Japan). Shallow earthquakes from 1980 - 1986 within 35 ° of MAJO {{are used to}} construct a common receiver gather. Processing of the wavefie 1 d data includes focal depth and static time corrections, as well as deterministic deconvolution, in order to <b>equalize</b> <b>pulse</b> shapes and align wavelets on the first arrivals. The processed wavefield data are slant stacked and iteratively downward continued to obtain a regional upper mantle velocity model. The model includes a low velocity rone between 107 and 220 km. Beneath the L VZ, the velocity increases smoothly down to the discontinuity at 40 I km. In the transition zone, the velocity model again increases linearly, although there is some suggestion of further complexity in the downward continued wavefield data. At {{the base of the}} transition zone, a second velocity discontinuity occurs at 660 km, with a linear velocity gradient below. In addition to slant-stack analysis, travel times and synthetic seismograms are computed and compared with the processed and unprocessed wavefield data. Key words: Slant-stack velocity analysis, upper mantIe structure...|$|R
50|$|For analog NTSC {{there are}} a total of 525 {{scanning}} lines of which originally 483 lines were visible (241.5 visible lines + 21 lines of vertical blanking per field) and later 480 (240 complete lines per field). quad video recording systems, the math suggests 15 transverse head passes, each consisting of 16 lines of video, are required to complete one field. A full frame consists of two fields. One field contains the odd-numbered lines and the other contains the even ones. By convention an NTSC video frame is considered to start with an even field followed by an odd field. The disparity of the line numbering compared to other systems is solved by defining the line numbering to start five equalizing pulses (or 2 and a half lines) earlier than on all other systems (including Systems A and E {{even though they had}} no equalizing pulses) on the first <b>equalizing</b> <b>pulse</b> following an active line or half line. This has the effect of placing a half line of video {{at the end of the}} even (first) field and the beginning of the odd (second field). Thus the line numbers correspond to the real lines of the video frame. On all other systems, the field was considered to start with the falling edge of the first field pulse which gave the confusing position that the odd field (first) had a half a line of video occupying the latter half of a whole line and ended with a whole line of video but half a scanning line (and vice versa for the even field). The NTSC convention solved this confusion.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a digital controller for AC voltage regulation of a bidirectional high-frequency link (BHFL) inverter using Deadbeat control. The proposed controller consists of inner current loop, outer voltage loop and a feed-forward controller, which imposes a gain scheduling effect {{according to the}} reference signal to compensate the steady-state error of the system. The main property of the proposed controller is that the current- and the voltage-loop controllers have the same structure, and use the same sampling period. This simplifies the design and implementation processes. To improve the overall performance of the system, additional disturbance decoupling networks are employed. This {{takes into account the}} model discretization effect. Therefore, accurate disturbance decoupling can be achieved, and the system robustness towards load variations is increased. To avoid transformer saturation due to low frequency voltage envelopes, an <b>equalized</b> <b>pulse</b> width modulation (PWM) technique has been introduced. The proposed controller has been realized using the DS 1104 digital signal processor (DSP) from dSPACE. Its performances have been tested on a one kVA prototype inverter. Experimental results showed that the proposed controller has very fast dynamic and good steady-state responses even under highly nonlinear loads...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a {{comparative study of}} two equalizers, the adaptive linear and the neural equalizer for indoor optical wireless (OW) links. Three modulation schemes representative {{of a range of}} modulation techniques widely adopted in indoor OW systems are chosen to investigate the effectiveness of the proposed equalizers. It is shown that on-off keying (OOK) modulation technique is least affected by the multipath induced intersymbol interference (ISI), while the pulse position modulation (PPM) scheme is the most severely affected. In case of highly diffused channel, the <b>equalized</b> digital <b>pulse</b> interval modulation (DPIM) outperforms the equalized PPM and {{there is little or no}} gain in using PPM compared to OOK.

40|$|High {{data rate}} clock {{recovery}} {{is a key}} technology for realizing future ultrafast optical time division multiplexed (OTDM) network. In this thesis study, an electric-optic type phase locked loop clock recovery circuit is developed which {{has the potential to}} operate at very high speed. Residue jitter free operation up to 80 Gb/s has been demonstrated which is in good agreement with the phase noise analysis included in this work. ^ The characteristics of the actively mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied in depth in this thesis work. A time domain circulating pulse model has been proposed to study the pulse width optimization problem as well as the output amplitude equalization problem associated with rational harmonic mode-locking. By proposing a cascaded modulator as the cavity loss modulator, amplitude <b>equalized</b> <b>pulse</b> train operating at 80 Gb/s has been obtained, which represents the highest order of rational harmonic mode-locking with amplitude equalized output ever reported so far. The dispersion effect on the detuning characteristics of the mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied. An analytic formula is derived which is capable of predicting the saturation effects associated with large frequency detunings. The analytic results obtained are well supported by both the numerical and the experimental investigations. By using the self-biased LiNbO 3 modulator as an artificial intensity dependent loss element, nearly 20 dB suppression of the relaxation oscillation noise peak has been demonstrated. Based on the linearized rate equation approach, a theory for the laser AM noise suppression has been developed. The jitter problem for harmonic mode-locked fiber lasers is also studied in the frequency domain. It is shown in this work that the super-mode noise contributes significantly to the timing jitter of the produced pulse train which explains the recent experimental observations well. Finally, as a connection between the clock recovery technique and the mode-locked fiber lasers, we extend the regenerative type mode-locking technique from the traditional harmonic region to the current rational harmonic region. In addition, {{with the help of a}} novel external repetition rate doubler based on the polarization maintaining fiber loop mirror, a highly stable pulse train operating at 80 Gb/s has been obtained. ...|$|R

Circuit techniques for excess-phase cancellation and for setting the corner-frequency of the filter and equalizer are also described.

The 20 -MHz sixth-order Bessel filter and second-order equalizer operate from 5 V, and generate only 0. 24 % (- 52 dB) of total harmonic distortion when processing 2 -VP-P differential output signals.
