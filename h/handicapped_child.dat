At trial, prosecutors said Gilbert used a large kitchen knife in an assault in Greenfield, Massachusetts in January or February 1988. Prosecutors said she tried twice to murder a person by poison in November 1995. Prosecutors said that Gilbert tried to poison a patient at the VA hospital on Jan. 28, 1996, and that she caused a medical emergency by removing a patient's breathing tube at the VA hospital on Jan. 30, 1994. Prosecutors said that Gilbert abandoned a patient undergoing cardiac arrest on Nov. 9, 1995, and then asked another nurse to accompany her on a check of patients. Prosecutors said she waited until her colleague independently spotted the patient's difficulty before raising an alarm. Gilbert forced an untrained colleague to use cardiac defibrillation paddles on a patient during a medical emergency on Nov. 17, 1995, by refusing to use the equipment herself. Prosecutors said Gilbert threatened the life of at least one person verbally and physically in July 1996.

2500|$|Arguing {{on behalf}} of the United States in support of the respondents, Elliot Schulder focused largely on matters of {{statutory}} interpretation rather than specific outcomes for Amy. When pressed by the justices regarding the educational standards required, he contended that the district court opinion went too far: [...] "the emphasis is not on potential or shortfall from potential, but on the making available to handicapped children the same opportunities that are available to non-handicapped children to benefit from the regular educational program that the state or local school authorities provide." [...] The justices brought up an issue Kuntz, for the petitioner, touched on: [...] "what's this court supposed to do? Independently make its own judgment or ... all I'm allowed to do is to decide whether the school acted arbitrarily?" [...] Essentially, should the court rule on whether aspects of the individual education program allow a <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> to reach their full potential or is the approval of an individual education program sufficient to satisfy the act. Schulder argues a middle ground: [...] "We don't think the court has to measure potential, but we do believe that the court has to make an independent determination whether, in this particular case, for example, the plan as developed provides the child in question access to the same educational opportunity available to non-handicapped children." ...|$|E

Orwell left Paris in December 1929 and returned to England, going straight home to his parents' house in Southwold. Later he acted as a private tutor to a <b>handicapped</b> <b>child</b> there and also undertook further tramping expeditions, culminating in a stint working in the Kent hop fields in August and September 1931.

For purposes of the study, the term <b>handicapped</b> referred to <b>children</b> that were emotionally disturbed, learning disabled, mentally retarded, and/or physically handicapped. The population for the study included all Extension Agents-Youth of the Indiana Cooperative Extension Service in each of the 92 Indiana counties. Where more than one Extension Agent-Youth was employed in a county, only one response was requested as the needed information concerned the total county 4 -H program being offered. A questionnaire, developed from a review of selected literature, was used as the method to gather data from the study group. The survey instrument was submitted to a group of 20 doctoral students and three professors of Educational Administration and Supervision for recommendations, subsequently revised and mailed to the study population. Counties where 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> have been developed were identified. Extension Agents-Youth working the counties where 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> existed were asked questions regarding (1) the number of <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> being served in the county, (2) how the 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> were organized and presented, and (3) the percent of impact the development of a 4 -H program for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> had on the total county 4 -H program in the specific areas of (a) personnel and staffing, (b) facilities, (c) materials and supplies, (d) finance, (e) time allocation and (f) the overall expenditure of the program. In addition, Extension AgentsYouth were asked questions regarding specific perceptions of the 4 -H program for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> in relation to the total 4 -H program being offered in the county. Data received from the questionnaire were compiled and used to provide an account of the involvement of <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> in 4 -H programs in Indiana. Responses from the different Extension Agents-Youth in the 92 counties where 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> existed were analyzed, summarized, and reported in table and narrative form. The findings and conclusions of the study support the following recommendations: 1. Additional research in the study of increased 4 -H programming for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> is greatly needed. 2. Formal programs and in-service training designed to provide proper and adequate training for leaders of 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> should be increased. 3. Extension Agents-Youth and leaders of 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> should become more familiar with current laws affecting educational programming for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children.</b> 4. Additional guidelines for organizing, developing, and implementing 4 -H programs for <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> should be considered by Extension personnel. 5. Documentation regarding the number of <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> participating in 4 -H programs should be more thoroughly recorded by Extension personnel and reported to the State Extension Office. 6. Since the life blood of 4 -H programs for the handicapped is the volunteer leader, efforts should be increased to recruit highly motivated, sincere individuals with a keen interest in working with special children. 7.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{relationship}} between achievement motivation and academic achievement with externalizing (i. e., aggressive, acting-out) and Internalizing (i. e., Immature withdrawal) emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children.</b> Furthermore, the mean difference in academic achievement of externalizers and Internalizers was examined. Analysis of variance, regression analysis, and t-test procedures were employed to analyze the data. Eighty-two subjects, in grades two through six, currently enrolled In special education programs for emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children,</b> participated in this study. The Child Behavior Checklist-Teacher's Report Form (TRF), and the resultant Child Behavior Profile (CBP) were used to differentiate between externalizing and internalizing emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children.</b> Furthermore, the TRF yielded information on school performance and adaptive functioning. The Thematic Apperception Test of Need for Achievement (TAT), and the Wide Range Achievement Test-Revised (WRAT-R) were administered by the researcher to gather data on achievement motivation and academic achievement, respectively. In general, the children in this study showed little or no motivation for achievement. An analysis of variance, comparing externalizers and internalizers in achievement motivation was not significant. A regression analysis, controlling for Intelligence, showed no difference in achievement motivation between externalizers and internalizers. Knowledge of group membership (i. e., externalizing or internalizing) added little to the explained variance of academic achievement. After controlling for intelligence and achievement motivation, externalizers and internalizers showed no difference in mean academic achievement. On the basis of teacher ratings of adaptive functioning skills considered necessary for success In the classroom, more than 75 % of emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> were rated in the clinical range. More than two-thirds of the children were rated below average in school performance. T-tests revealed no difference between externalizers and internalizers in adaptive functioning skills or school performance. ConclusionsBased on the results of this study, the following conclusions were drawn:Emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> are generally lacking in motivation for achievement. Externalizing emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children,</b> and Internalizing emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> do not differ in motivation for achievement. Achievement motivation and academic achievement are not significantly related with emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children.</b> Externalizing emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children,</b> and internalizing emotionally and behaviorally <b>handicapped</b> <b>children</b> show no difference in mean academic achievement. 5.
