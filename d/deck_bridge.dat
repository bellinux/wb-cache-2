5|$|The {{son of a}} {{distinguished}} Norwegian family, Sverdrup emigrated to the United States in 1914. After serving with the US Army in World War I, he {{earned a degree in}} civil engineering at the University of Minnesota in 1921. He worked for a time for the Missouri State Highway Department before founding Sverdrup & Parcel, a civil engineering firm specializing in bridge construction, with John Ira Parcel, his former University of Minnesota engineering professor. His firm was involved in the construction of a number of important bridges, including the Washington Bridge and Amelia Earhart Bridge over the Missouri River and the Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge</b> over the Lake of the Ozarks.|$|E
5|$|In August 1922, Tosa {{was moved}} to Kure, still incomplete. Fifty {{thousand}} people turned out to watch as the battleship was towed out of the harbor by five tugboats. The barbettes for the 406mm (16inch) guns were in place, but no turrets or weapons had been mounted, so {{the holes in the}} main deck were covered with a mesh-like material. Her hull was finished, and a superstructure <b>deck,</b> <b>bridge</b> deck and conning tower had been fitted, along with a light signal mast directly aft of the second barbette. The conning tower had to be outfitted as a bridge, as there was no other suitable location; compared with those of similar ships, it was much smaller, as it only contained two levels and bridge wings. An exhaust pipe resembling an extremely small funnel was fitted so that heat could be supplied within the ship.|$|E

40|$|Recent {{earthquakes}} {{have highlighted}} the seismic vulnerability of bridges due to excessive movements {{at the joints}} (in simply supported <b>deck</b> <b>bridges)</b> or concentration of seismic forces in a few piers (in multi-span continuous <b>deck</b> <b>bridges).</b> Steel-based seismic restrainers and viscous shock transmitters are used to limit the joint openings in simply supported <b>deck</b> <b>bridges</b> or to redistribute the seismic force among all piers in continuous <b>deck</b> <b>bridges,</b> respectively. Currently used devices, however, have some limitations such as large dimensions, no energy dissipation, possible large residual displacements, bad control of the force transmitted to the substructure (steel restrainers), large dimensions, difficulty of installation in existing structures, need of maintenance, and sensitivity to the earthquake characteristics (viscous shock transmitters). Shape memory alloys (SMAs) with superelastic behavior show the potential to overcome the limitations involved in the current technologies. In this article, a multi-performance seismic device based on superelastic SMA wires is proposed for the seismic retrofit of multi-span simply supported and continuous <b>deck</b> <b>bridges.</b> The effectiveness of the SMA devices is assessed {{through a number of}} nonlinear time-history analyses on two bridge structures representative of existing Italian highway bridges. Results are compared to the seismic response of the bridges in the as-built configuration...|$|R

2500|$|In 2012-13 four bridges near Rangiriri between Auckland and Hamilton were {{replaced}}. The bridges {{were all}} over 100 years old with steel spans and timber piers, and were replaced by modern low-maintenance concrete ballast <b>deck</b> <b>bridges.</b> Bridges 479, 480, 481 & 482 were replaced, with lengths of , , [...] and [...] respectively.|$|R
500|$|The {{extension}} {{would look}} {{similar to the}} original section of the turnpike, but would use air-entrained concrete poured onto stone. Transverse joints on the pavement were spaced at [...] intervals rather than the [...] ones on the original portion. Because it traversed through less mountainous terrain, the extension did not require as much earthwork as the original section. It required the construction of large bridges, including those that cross the Susquehanna River and the Swatara Creek. To save money, the Susquehanna River Bridge was constructed with a -raised concrete median and no shoulders. This extension of the turnpike would use the same style of overpasses as the original section; the steel <b>deck</b> <b>bridge</b> was also introduced. With {{the construction of the}} Philadelphia extension, the Carlisle interchange was closed and the Middlesex interchange with US 11 was realigned to allow for the new extension; it was renamed to the Carlisle interchange.|$|E
500|$|Initially {{the young}} firm struggled, with no {{contracts}} for major jobs lined {{up after the}} Hermann bridge, and by early 1929 it faced insolvency. However neither Sverdrup nor Parcel wished to let well-trained employees go, something which became an informal company policy over the years. A $17,000 fee for the design and supervision {{of the construction of}} the 7th Street Trafficway Bridge in Kansas City, Kansas, and then a [...] $32,000 one for the Fairfax Bridge over the Missouri River helped Sverdrup & Parcel weather the worst of the Great Depression. The subsequent New Deal involved a major program of public works. Sverdrup & Parcel applied to the Public Works Administration for the design commissions for the Washington Bridge over the Missouri River at Washington, Missouri and the Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge</b> over the Lake of the Ozarks in Camden County, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel was awarded both contracts, valued at $42,000 and $43,000 respectively. During 1934, it was awarded the contract for what is now known as the Amelia Earhart Bridge over the Missouri River between Atchison, Kansas and Buchanan County, Missouri. Sverdrup & Parcel was now becoming involved in projects further afield. A project to generate electricity from tidal power at Passamaquoddy Bay brought Sverdrup into contact with Captain Hugh J. (Pat) Casey of the US Army Corps of Engineers, the chief engineer on the project. The project folded when federal funding was withdrawn in 1936, but Sverdrup and Casey became friends. In 1940, Sverdrup was appointed to the board of inquiry that investigated the collapse of the Tacoma Narrows Bridge.|$|E

40|$|Five {{localized}} {{punching shear}} failures occurred on important precast <b>deck</b> panel <b>bridges</b> in southwest Florida. This {{was attributed to}} the use of compressible fiberboard for supporting the precast panels. This paper describes the in-depth investigation undertaken to understand the cause of failure and the subsequent development of a deterioration model for identifying at-risk <b>deck</b> panel <b>bridges.</b> This was based on a comprehensive review of historical inspection records, bridge plans, special reports, on-site forensic investigation of bridges being replaced and interviews with inspectors. The qualitative deterioration model identified 13 stages leading to failure and was successfully used to prioritize the planned replacement of 85 precast <b>deck</b> panel <b>bridges</b> over ten years. The validity of the model was proven by subsequent punching shear failures of two more precast panel <b>deck</b> <b>bridges,</b> both included in the top ten at-risk bridge list. ...|$|R

2500|$|The Tibetan saint and bridge-builder Thangtong Gyalpo {{originated}} {{the use of}} iron chains in {{his version}} of simple suspension bridges. In 1433, Gyalpo built eight bridges in eastern Bhutan. The last surviving chain-linked bridge of Gyalpo's was the Thangtong Gyalpo Bridge in Duksum en route to Trashi Yangtse, which was finally washed away in 2004. Gyalpo's iron chain bridges {{did not include a}} suspended <b>deck</b> <b>bridge</b> which is the standard on [...] all modern suspension bridges today. Instead, both the railing and the walking layer of Gyalpo's bridges used wires. The stress points that carried the screed were reinforced by the iron chains. Before the use of iron chains it is thought that Gyalpo used ropes from twisted willows or yak skins. He may have also used tightly bound cloth.|$|E
50|$|The Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge</b> {{was one of}} {{the most}} similar bridges to the I-35W Mississippi River bridge in the nation and the most {{identical}} in Missouri. However, it was in much better condition than the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge. It was of the Deck-truss construction for Vehicular traffic. The Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge</b> had a longer main span than the I-35W Mississippi River Bridge (462 feet vs. 458 feet). The I-35W Mississippi River bridge spanned both sides of the Mississippi River in contrast to the Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge.</b> Its daily traffic was about 8,000 cars daily versus 140,000 cars daily. Due to this, the Hurricane <b>Deck</b> <b>Bridge</b> had a weaker steel construction than the I-35W Bridge steel construction.|$|E
