The three major mechanisms for such an <b>imbalance</b> are enumerated in Virchow's triad: alterations in normal blood flow, injury to the blood vessel wall, and alterations in the constitution of blood (hypercoagulability). Most cases of cerebral venous sinus thrombosis are due to hypercoagulability.|$|E

5|$|Dana discovers Em {{was killed}} by Lester Majak, an aging local celebrity. Majak was a {{physical}} trainer who was convinced his fitness regime would extend his life. When he began to notice his growing frailty, he researched a legend of immortality from India. A particular creek near Wausau met the requirements for the legend, and Majak murdered Em near it in a ritual to extend his life. However, Em's recent pregnancy provided additional life force and caused an <b>imbalance</b> that resulted in Revival Day. The <b>imbalance</b> is still affecting the river, and will grow to threaten all life on Earth. To restore balance, Em must give birth before she reunites with her soul and permanently dies. As she delivers her daughter, the remaining revivers merge with their souls as well.|$|E

40|$|In {{this short}} paper, I {{attempt to provide}} a {{synthesis}} of the debate, evidence and prospects for <b>imbalances</b> within the euro area. By <b>imbalances</b> I mean current account <b>imbalances</b> and their associated capital flows. Our organizers, in asking {{me to talk about}} <b>imbalances,</b> were astute enough not to specify whether they meant current account <b>imbalances,</b> fiscal <b>imbalances,</b> or competitive <b>imbalances.</b> 1 Obviously, current accounts, budget balances and unit labor costs are “three sides of the same coin. ” They are connected to one another and to other variables as part of the general equilibrium system that is the European economy. While there is no rigid link among them (experience has taught us, for example, to guard against any mechanical notion of twin deficits), one cannot really talk about one without talking about the others. That said, every paper needs a focus. My focus here is on current account <b>imbalances</b> and capital flows. Similarly, {{it is not possible to}} meaningfully discuss <b>imbalances</b> within the euro area in isolation from <b>imbalances</b> between the euro area and the rest of the world. For the countries of the euro-area periphery, the two stories are, admittedly, basically the same: members of the periphery have run persistent deficits against both the rest of euroland and the rest of the world...|$|R

5|$|Each {{particle}} {{of matter}} has a corresponding antimatter particle {{with the opposite}} electrical charge. Thus, the positron is a positively charged antielectron and the antiproton is a negatively charged equivalent of a proton. When a matter and corresponding antimatter particle meet, they annihilate each other. Because of this, along with an <b>imbalance</b> {{between the number of}} matter and antimatter particles, the latter are rare in the universe. The first causes of this <b>imbalance</b> are not yet fully understood, although theories of baryogenesis may offer an explanation. As a result, no antimatter atoms have been discovered in nature. However, in 1996 the antimatter counterpart of the hydrogen atom (antihydrogen) was synthesized at the CERN laboratory in Geneva.|$|E
5|$|Reports {{suggest that}} <b>imbalance</b> of brain metal {{homeostasis}} {{may be a}} cause of PrPSc-associated neurotoxicity, though the underlying mechanisms are difficult to explain based on existing information. Proposed hypotheses include a functional role for PrPC in metal metabolism, and loss of this function due to aggregation to the disease-associated PrPSc form {{as the cause of}} brain metal <b>imbalance.</b> Other views suggest gain of toxic function by PrPSc due to sequestration of PrPC-associated metals within the aggregates, resulting in the generation of redox-active PrPSc complexes. The physiological implications of some PrPC-metal interactions are known, while others are still unclear. The pathological implications of PrPC-metal interaction include metal-induced oxidative damage, and in some instances conversion of PrPC to a PrPSc-like form.|$|E

Finally, price volatility is related positively to lagged small trader <b>imbalances,</b> and negatively to lagged variability of speculator <b>imbalances.</b> Our {{findings are consistent}} with the view that speculators have limited risk-bearing capacity, and are short-term focused, with trades that are, in general, not destabilizing...|$|R

This work reviews and analyses several contrasting contributions on a series of issues regarding global <b>imbalances,</b> namely their nature, their underlying forces, their past evolution and their expected developments.

40|$|The Support Vector Machine (SVM), a known discriminative {{classifier}} is {{ineffective in}} dealing with <b>imbalanced</b> classification problems where the training examples of target class are outnumbered by non-target class examples. Though cost-SVM (cSVM) has been proposed to tackle the <b>imbalanced</b> datasets by assigning different cost functions to different classes, the performance is less than satisfactory due to its limited ability to enforce cost-sensitivity. In this research, a generative classifier, Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM) is studied which can learn {{the distribution of the}} <b>imbalanced</b> data to improve the discriminative power between <b>imbalanced</b> classes. By fusing this knowledge into cSVM, a model fusion approach, termed CSG (cSVM+GMM), is proposed to tackle the <b>imbalanced</b> classification problem.

5|$|Indonesia is {{the largest}} {{aviation}} market in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN). However, Indonesia {{is not yet a}} full member of the ASEAN open sky agreement, which plans to lift regional flying restrictions throughout Southeast Asia on member country airlines by the end of 2015 or early 2016. Indonesia is considering opening up only five of its international airports under this policy; they are Jakarta, Medan, Bali, Surabaya and Makassar. To date, Indonesia has agreed to open access to Jakarta, yet, Indonesia remains opposed to opening up its secondary cities. Currently Indonesia adopt limitations for foreign airlines to operate in Indonesia. This rather protectionist stance was meant to protect Indonesian aviation business against competitors, particularly from Singapore and Malaysia. Basically, this stance is stemmed from a systematic <b>imbalance</b> between ASEAN nations; as a large nation, Indonesia is able to offer hundreds of access points, while other fellow ASEAN members may offer far less points of access. Singapore for example has only one point of access, while Malaysia may offer two or three access points. This systematic <b>imbalance</b> for exchange of traffic rights has led Indonesian carriers to lobby their government to refrain from entering into multilateral agreement on ASEAN Single Aviation Market.|$|E

40|$|This paper makes three points. The {{first is}} that {{external}} <b>imbalances</b> between Member States are relevant {{for the performance of}} a monetary union when the latter is not backed by a strong political commitment and a solid political framework. Eurozone policymakers have ignored these inter-member <b>imbalances</b> and have instead concentrated on union-wide <b>imbalances,</b> so much so that statistical data on the former phenomenon still remain largely incomplete. There are signs that a correction is in the making, which we hope will lead to a comprehensive quantitative knowledge of intra-EMU <b>imbalances.</b> The second objective of the paper is to design specific policies aimed at reducing inter-member external disequilibria, for example by fixing targets on current-account <b>imbalances</b> symmetrically applied to both deficit and surplus countries. The contrast between the keen attention of the EZ policymakers on national fiscal <b>imbalances</b> and the belated and lukewarm attention given to external <b>imbalances</b> is striking. The third aim of the paper is to propose a more flexible monetary policy aimed at controlling the distribution of liquidity among Member States, resulting from inter-member external <b>imbalances.</b> Our proposal is that National Central Banks should add a risk premium cost to official interest rates on banks that accumulate “excessive” borrowings or deposits to compensate, respectively, for outflows and inflows of the monetary base due to the effect of external <b>imbalances.</b> JEL classification: E 42, E 52, E 5...|$|R
