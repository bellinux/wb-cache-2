60|$|Steps shuffled {{along the}} corridor. I looked up sharply. She set a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> There fell a knock, and old Busio stood before us.|$|E
60|$|The girl put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> {{to impress}} silence, {{and the man}} nodded; they sat as still as mice whilst the two {{children}} went on talking.|$|E
60|$|Half an {{hour later}} the {{mistress}} of the zenana came in. Rabda rose and put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and left the room, accompanied by the woman.|$|E
60|$|She {{looks at}} a door on {{the left of the}} hall, and puts a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b>|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> as {{the door}} again opened. The old woman entered, {{carrying}} some clothes.|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> with {{whatever}} warning intention, {{and followed her}} husband into {{the presence of the}} actor, and almost into his arms, so rapturous was the meeting between them.|$|R
60|$|Alice {{opens the}} door, and sees Amy {{standing}} there with her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> just as they stood in all the five plays. Ginevra could not have posed her better.|$|E
60|$|Curtis came to {{the door}} again and tapped. She put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and so he stood silent, looking in at her. His eyes called her and she rose and tiptoed to the door.|$|E
6000|$|There she was, {{seated at}} the bedside, smiling quietly and lifting her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips!</b> As {{certainly}} as I saw the familiar objects in the room, and the prostrate figure on the bed, I saw--Madame Fontaine! ...|$|E
60|$|As {{she lay on}} {{her back}} she tried twice <b>to</b> raise <b>her</b> arm. The third time she got two thin <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and blew a kiss out of the black pit <b>to</b> Billy Jackson. <b>Her</b> arm fell back limply.|$|R
6000|$|Florida noiselessly {{opened the}} door, and met the servant {{with a tray}} of coffee. She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> and motioned <b>her</b> not <b>to</b> enter, asking in a whisper: [...] "What time is it, Nina? I forgot to wind my watch." ...|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> {{and smiled}} {{with the air}} of a lady benefactress; then, with a few words of {{official}} sympathy, she encouraged him to get well, and flitted to the next bed, where she bestowed a jacqueminot rosebud on a Chinaman dying of cancer.|$|R
60|$|She put a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{with a quick}} {{peremptory}} {{gesture to}} Dion, then she recrossed the studio with a firm step and the curtains of the inner door fell back behind her with a swish.|$|E
6000|$|Safely {{inside the}} door she turned, and with a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> a roguish light in her eyes, she said: [...] "I {{want to tell you}} something. I can't wait any longer. Enid's Choice ran to the {{capacity}} of the house last week." ...|$|E
6000|$|... [She {{stops and}} buts her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> for JOY is coming [...] towards them, as the tea-bell sounds. She is {{followed}} by DICK [...] and MISS BEECH with the Eau de Cologne. The COLONEL and MRS. [...] HOPE are also coming back, discussing still each other's point [...] of view.] ...|$|E
6000|$|When Mr. Prince {{returned}} an hour later, he found Carry {{sitting on a}} low stool at Mrs. Starbottle's feet. Her head was in her stepmother's lap, and she had sobbed herself to sleep. Mrs. Starbottle put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> [...] "I told you she would come. God bless you, Jack! and good night." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later she saw him wading, and {{directly}} afterwards he stood upon the sands opposite <b>to</b> <b>her.</b> He waved his hand. She put <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and threw him a kiss. He pretended not to notice, and started off toward the village, and her low laugh came floating {{to him in a}} momentary lull of the wind.|$|R
60|$|There she {{had passed}} the night and {{a portion of the}} ensuing day, visited only by Cypros, who, when Eva would have inquired the cause of all this mysterious cruelty and startling {{contrast}} to the dispositions which had preceded it, only shook her head and pressed <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> <b>to</b> signify the impossibility of her conversing with her captive.|$|R
6000|$|She {{could not}} speak, and her wild and frightened air might well give him great alarm. She {{pointed to the}} nursery, and put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> and he, beckoning to her to follow him, went downstairs, and turning into the drawing-room, said, as he sank down upon the sofa, 'Now, Phyllis, what has happened?' ...|$|E
60|$|His hand {{struck the}} window heavily, {{and she looked}} up and saw him. She nodded, and put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> as a sign that he must be cautious. She had often, in the long ago, seen her mother signing thus to an {{imaginary}} face at the window--the face of the man who never came.|$|E
60|$|The key {{turned in}} the lock beneath the gentle {{pressure}} of her fingers, the bolt slipped quietly back and she pushed the door ajar. Within, Billy Byrne turned inquiring eyes {{in the direction of}} the opening door, and as he saw who it was who entered surprise showed upon his face; but he spoke no word for the girl held a silencing <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b>|$|E
6000|$|The Second Lady: [...] "I am so {{glad you}} {{happened}} to ask me. It has all been so dreadfully sudden, and I am quite bewildered. Let me think {{if there is anything}} more!" [...] As she stands with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip,</b> the first lady makes a movement as if about to speak, but does not say anything. [...] "No, there is nothing more, I believe." ...|$|R
60|$|She put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> quickly <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{and threw}} a world of unutterable and enigmatical meaning into her mischievous face.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yassir. When I comed {{here from}} Caroliny de Mistis done tole me not ter let er soul in hyah. One day erbout three mont's ergo, dis yer lady come en she des wheedled me ter let her in. She was de quality, Marse Dave, and I was des' afeard not ter. I declar' I hatter. Hush," [...] said Lindy, putting <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> [...] "dar's de Mistis!" ...|$|R
60|$|Putting her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> {{she cast}} {{a quick glance}} at the absorbed figure on the veranda and stepped before the desk. She fitted the key to the drawer and opened it rapidly but noiselessly. There lay the envelope, and among other ticketed papers a small roll of greenbacks--such as her father often kept there. It was HIS money; she did not scruple to take it with the envelope. Handing the latter to the Chinaman, who made it {{instantly}} disappear up his sleeve like a conjurer's act, she signed him to follow her into the hall.|$|E
60|$|She {{pressed her}} <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> for they {{had arrived at}} the tent of Tancred. The young Emir, drying his {{streaming}} eyes, entered first, and then came back and ushered in Eva. They stood together by the couch of Tancred. The expression of distress, of suffering, of extreme tension, which had not marred, but which, at least, had mingled with the spiritual character of his countenance the previous day, had disappeared. If it were death, it was at least beautiful. Softness and repose suffused his features, and his brow {{looked as if it had}} been the temple of an immortal spirit.|$|E
60|$|After coming {{regularly}} {{every night}} for a week she bade the young knight follow her, holding her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> in sign that caution must be observed. Passing through several passages, he was at length led into a room where a lady of some forty years of age, surrounded by several slaves and younger women, was sitting. Cuthbert felt no scruple in making a deep obeisance to her; the respect shown to women {{in the days of}} chivalry was very great, and Cuthbert, in bowing almost to the ground before the lady who was really his mistress, did not feel that he was humiliating himself.|$|E
60|$|Her {{eyes widened}} with {{surprise}} {{when she saw}} who the visitor was, and she put a <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip</b> and pointed <b>to</b> the sleeper. And, as we have to record another of {{the long list of}} Steve's failures to propose we may say here, in excuse, that this reception took {{a great deal of the}} edge off the dashing resolution which had been his up to that moment. It made him feel self-conscious from the start.|$|R
6000|$|... "Hush, papa! There {{is no need}} {{to bring}} blushes on the cheeks of my dear ones, Martin Lambert!" [...] said the mother, putting <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> husband's <b>lips.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; Mrs Roper is respectable, Mr Eames; {{but there}} are some here that--Hush-sh-sh!" [...] And the old lady put <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> up <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips.</b> The door opened and Mrs Lupex swam into the room.|$|R
6000|$|When Katharine rose, with a {{profound}} sigh, to resume her duties, Ralph went with her, {{and neither of}} them formulated any guess, on their way downstairs, as to who this anonymous lady might prove to be. Perhaps the fantastic notion {{that she was a}} little black hunchback provided with a steel knife, which she would plunge into Katharine's heart, appeared to Ralph more probable than another, and he pushed first into the dining-room to avert the blow. Then he exclaimed [...] "Cassandra!" [...] with such heartiness at the sight of Cassandra Otway standing by the dining-room table that she put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and begged him to be quiet.|$|E
6000|$|She went a {{few paces}} past the corner, came in sight of the run {{containing}} the giant chicks and stopped again. [...] "Ah!" [...] she said, {{and shook her head}} slowly at the sight of them. They were at that time about the height of emus, but of course much thicker in the body--a larger thing altogether. They were all hens and five all told, now that the two cockerels had killed each other. She hesitated at their drooping attitudes. [...] "Poor dears!" [...] she said, and put down her bundle; [...] "they've got no water. And they've 'ad no food these twenty-four hours! And such appetites, too, as they 'ave!" [...] She put a lean <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and communed with herself.|$|E
60|$|Cynthia, {{trying to}} read {{in front of the}} fire, was all in a tremble {{at the sound of the}} high-pitched little voices she had grown to love, and she longed to go out and kiss them, every one. Her nature, however, shrank from any act which might appear {{dramatic}} or sensational. She could not resist going to the window and smiling at them, though they appeared but dimly--little dancing figures in a mist. And when they shouted, the more she shook her head and put her <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> in reproof and vanished from their sight. Then they trooped sadly on to school, resolved to make matters as disagreeable as possible for poor Miss Bruce, who had not offended in any way.|$|E
60|$|Catriona set <b>her</b> <b>fingers</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips</b> and whistled once, with an {{exceeding}} clear, strong, mounting note, as full as a ploughman's. A {{while we}} stood silent: and I was about <b>to</b> ask <b>her</b> <b>to</b> repeat the same, when I {{heard the sound}} of some one bursting through the bushes below on the braeside. I pointed in that direction with a smile, and presently Neil leaped into the garden. His eyes burned, and he had a black knife (as they call it on the Highland side) naked in his hand; but, seeing me beside his mistress, stood like a man struck.|$|R
6000|$|... "A note, mademoiselle, from Mademoiselle d'Etamps--and mademoiselle," [...] {{and she put}} <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> mysteriously <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lips,</b> [...] "it is a new lackey {{has brought}} it. I told him to come again in ten minutes for an answer; for I thought it better he should not come in {{to be looked at}} by Francois and Jules." ...|$|R
6000|$|Beranger, in {{his dark}} closet, comforted himself with the shrewd {{suspicion}} {{that his father was}} so employed as not to be expected at home till supper-time, and that his mother's wrath was by no means likely to be so enduring as <b>to</b> lead <b>her</b> <b>to</b> make complaints of the prisoners; and when he heard a trampling of horses in the court, he anticipated a speedy release and summons to show himself to the visitors. He waited long, however, before he heard the pattering of little feet; then a stool scraped along the floor, the button of his door was undone, the stool pushed back, and as he emerged, Eustacie stood before him with <b>her</b> <b>finger</b> <b>to</b> <b>her</b> <b>lip.</b> 'CHUT, Beranger! It is my father and uncle, and Narcisse, and, oh! so many gens d'armes. They are come to summon M. le Baron to go with them to disperse the preche by the Bac de l'Oie. And oh, Beranger, is he not there?' ...|$|R
