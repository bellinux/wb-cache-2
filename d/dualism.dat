In the 20th century, its major defenders have been Karl Popper and John Carew Eccles. It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.|$|E

5|$|<b>Dualism</b> {{is a set}} {{of views}} about the {{relationship}} between mind and matter (or body). It begins with the claim that mental phenomena are, in some respects, non-physical. One of the earliest known formulations of mind–body <b>dualism</b> was expressed in the eastern Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy (c. 650 BCE), which divided the world into purusha (mind/spirit) and prakriti (material substance). Specifically, the Yoga Sutra of Patanjali presents an analytical approach {{to the nature of the}} mind.|$|E

This paper {{considers}} a number of <b>dualisms</b> in the way we conceive of and describe time, and how these <b>dualisms</b> function in the relationship between music analysis and music perception. Using the opening of the second movement from Webern's Symphony as a case study, McTaggart's tensed/un-tensed distinction will be considered, as will the static/dynamic conceptions of Newtonian/Einsteinian time. Various analytical methods will be placed relative to these <b>dualisms...</b>|$|R
5000|$|Haraway {{highlights}} the problematic use and justification of Western traditions like patriarchy, colonialism, essentialism, and naturalism (among others). These traditions in turn {{allow for the}} problematic formations of taxonomies (and identifications of the Other) and what Haraway explains as [...] "antagonistic dualisms" [...] that order Western discourse. These <b>dualisms,</b> Haraway states, [...] "have all been systematic to the logics and practices of domination of women, people of color, nature, workers, animals... all those constituted as others." [...] She highlights specific problematic <b>dualisms</b> of self/other, culture/nature, male/female, civilized/primitive, right/wrong, truth/illusion, total/partial, God/man (among others). She explains that these <b>dualisms</b> are in competition with one another, creating paradoxical relations of domination (especially between the One and the Other). However, high-tech culture provides a challenge to these antagonistic <b>dualisms.</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{writings}} of Wassily Kandinsky and Paul Klee, Bauhaus theorists and pioneers of nonrepresentational art, are {{the framework for}} a discussion of contemporary issues in computational design. Kandinsky and Klee wrote of the many misguided <b>dualisms</b> in the art theory and pedagogy of their time. They sought to reconcile the seemingly mutually exclusive issues associated with abstraction in art. Some of these <b>dualisms,</b> and new ones, arise today in discussions of computational design. How and whether these <b>dualisms</b> can be reconciled in computational design are considered here. ...|$|R
5|$|René Descartes {{proposed}} {{the theory of}} <b>dualism</b> to tackle {{the issue of the}} brain's relation to the mind. He suggested that the pineal gland was where the mind interacted with the body after recording the brain mechanisms responsible for circulating cerebrospinal fluid. This <b>dualism</b> likely provided impetus for later anatomists to further explore the relationship between the anatomical and functional aspects of brain anatomy.|$|E
5|$|<b>Dualism</b> and monism {{are the two}} central {{schools of}} thought on the mind–body problem, {{although}} nuanced views have arisen that do not fit {{one or the other}} category neatly. <b>Dualism</b> is seen even in the Eastern tradition, in the Sankhya and Yoga schools of Hindu philosophy, and Plato, but its entry into Western philosophy was thanks to René Descartes in the 17th century. Substance dualists like Descartes argue that the mind is an independently existing substance, whereas property dualists maintain that the mind is a group of independent properties that emerge from and cannot be reduced to the brain, but {{that it is not a}} distinct substance.|$|E
5|$|During {{his time}} at Harvard, Whitehead {{produced}} his most important philosophical contributions. In 1925, he wrote Science and the Modern World, which was immediately hailed {{as an alternative to}} the Cartesian <b>dualism</b> that plagued popular science. Lectures from 1927–28, were published in 1929 as a book named Process and Reality, which has been compared (both in importance and difficulty) to Kant's Critique of Pure Reason.|$|E
50|$|Standpoint feminists {{have been}} {{concerned}} with these <b>dualisms</b> for two related reasons. First, <b>dualisms</b> usually imply a hierarchical relationship between the terms, elevating one and devaluing the other. He also said that when we suggest that decisions should be made rationally, not emotionally, for example, we are showing that reason holds a higher value in our culture than does emotion. Also, related to this issue is the concern that these <b>dualisms</b> often become gendered in our culture. In this process, men are associated with one extreme and women with the other. In the case of reason and emotion, women are identified with emotion. Because our culture values emotion less than reason, women suffer from this association. Feminist critics are usually concerned {{with the fact that}} <b>dualisms</b> force false dichotomies (partition of a whole) onto women and men, failing to see that life is less either/or than both/and, as Relational Dialectics Theory holds.|$|R

5|$|If {{consciousness}} (the mind) {{can exist}} independently of physical reality (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. <b>Dualism</b> must therefore explain how consciousness affects physical reality. One {{possible explanation is}} that of a miracle, proposed by Arnold Geulincx and Nicolas Malebranche, where all mind–body interactions require the direct intervention of God.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishad {{describes}} four {{kinds of}} sannyasins (Hindu monks), their eating habits and lifestyle. Yoga is {{the path of}} spiritual liberation for all four. Of these, the Paramahamsa monks are discussed in this text at greater length, and described as loners who are patient with everyone, free from <b>dualism</b> in their thoughts, and who meditate on their soul and the Brahman.|$|E
5|$|The Upanishadic age was {{characterized}} by a pluralism of worldviews. While some Upanishads have been deemed 'monistic', others, including the Katha Upanishad, are dualistic. The Maitri {{is one of the}} Upanishads that inclines more toward <b>dualism,</b> thus grounding classical Samkhya and Yoga schools of Hinduism, in contrast to the non-dualistic Upanishads at the foundation of its Vedanta school. They contain a plurality of ideas.|$|E
40|$|Taking the Critique of Judgement for {{an answer}} to the problem raised by the kantian <b>dualisms,</b> I offer a reading of this work {{according}} to which in the part devoted to the teleological judgement Kant practices a Hegelian way of resolution, whereas, in the “critique of the aesthetic judgement”, he thinks the relation between the opposites of such <b>dualisms</b> in a new way that opens up the possibility of a dialectical thought rid of the absolutness of the Hegelian reason...|$|R

He could not accept any theory of two nations, however worded, because it would make of those neither French nor English second-class citizens.|$|E
5|$|Another {{important}} {{argument in}} favor of <b>dualism</b> is that the mental and the physical seem to have quite different, and perhaps irreconcilable, properties. Mental events have a subjective quality, whereas physical events do not. So, for example, one can reasonably ask what a burnt finger feels like, or what a blue sky looks like, or what nice music sounds like to a person. But it is meaningless, or at least odd, to ask what a surge in the uptake of glutamate in the dorsolateral portion of the hippocampus feels like.|$|E

He was {{initiated}} into sanyasa (asceticism) {{after which he}} earned the name Madhvacharya (or Anandatirtha). Later, he disagreed with the views of his guru and began to travel India. He successfully debated with many scholars and philosophers during this time and won over Naraharitirtha, a minister in Kalinga, who would later become Madhvacharya's first notable disciple. Unlike Adi Shankaracharya (788–820) who preached Advaita philosophy (monism) and Ramanujacharya who propounded Vishishtadvaita philosophy (qualified monism), Madhvacharya taught the Dvaita philosophy (<b>dualism).</b>|$|E
40|$|How {{wildlife}} is defined, {{and which}} wildlife is accorded protection, emerges from competing constructions {{of nature and}} culture. Few species of Australian wildlife have as ambiguous an identity as dingoes. This paper identifies three <b>dualisms</b> that characterise discourses relating to Australian dingoes Canis lupus dingo. They are at once classified as both a pest and protected species, perceived to be feral and native, and most recently categorised as either pure or hybrid. It is argued that these <b>dualisms</b> are underpinned by {{different versions of the}} nature-culture dichotomy. Portrayals and perceptions of dingoes around Australia are explored to reveal how different aspects of the <b>dualisms</b> identified are drawn upon within different contexts. Illustrations of the contradictory constructions of dingoes highlight the need to critically deconstruct discourses relating to wildlife, particularly when they inform actions. As such, this paper demonstrates the important contribution a discourse-sensitive approach can make to understanding human perceptions of wildlife.

5|$|One {{can solve}} these problems, {{according}} to Fodor, with functionalism, a hypothesis {{which was designed}} to overcome the failings of both <b>dualism</b> and reductionism. What is important is the function of a mental state regardless of the physical substrate which implements it. The foundation for this view lies in the principle of the multiple realizability of the mental. Under this view, for example, I and a computer can both instantiate ("realize") the same functional state though we are made of completely different material stuff (see graphic at right). On this basis functionalism can be classified as a form of token materialism.|$|E
5|$|Phenomenalism is {{the theory}} that {{representations}} (or sense data) of external objects are all that exist. Such a view was briefly adopted by Bertrand Russell {{and many of the}} logical positivists during the early 20th century. A third possibility is to accept the existence of a basic substance that is neither physical nor mental. The mental and physical would then both be properties of this neutral substance. Such a position was adopted by Baruch Spinoza and was popularized by Ernst Mach in the 19th century. This neutral monism, as it is called, resembles property <b>dualism.</b>|$|E

5|$|Philosophy of {{psychology}} {{is a relatively}} young field, because psychology only became a discipline of its own in the late 1800s. In particular, neurophilosophy has just recently become its own field with the works of Paul Churchland and Patricia Churchland. Philosophy of mind, by contrast, has been a well-established discipline since before psychology was a field of study at all. It is concerned with questions about {{the very nature of}} mind, the qualities of experience, and particular issues like the debate between <b>dualism</b> and monism. Another related field is philosophy of language.|$|E
5|$|Shaktism's {{focus on}} the Divine Feminine does not imply a {{rejection}} of masculine. It rejects male-female, soul-body, transcendent-immanent <b>dualism,</b> considering nature as divine. Devi {{is considered to be}} the cosmos itself – she is the embodiment of energy, matter and soul, the motivating force behind all action and existence in the material universe. Yet in Shaktism, states C. MacKenzie Brown, the masculine and the feminine are aspects of the divine, transcendent reality. In Hindu iconography, the cosmic dynamic of masculine-feminine interdependence and equivalence, is expressed in the half-Shakti, half-Shiva deity known as Ardhanari.|$|E
5|$|Substance <b>Dualism</b> is {{a common}} feature of several {{orthodox}} Hindu schools including the Sāṅkhya, Nyāya, Yoga and Dvaita Vedanta. In these schools a clear difference is drawn between matter and a non-material soul, which is eternal and undergoes samsara, a cycle of death and rebirth. The Nyāya school argued that qualities such as cognition and desire are inherent qualities which are not possessed by anything solely material, and therefore by process of elimination must belong to a non-material self, the atman. Many of these schools see their spiritual goal as moksha, liberation from the cycle of reincarnation.|$|E
