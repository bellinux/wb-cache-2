The building energy audit is defined as a process to evaluate where the energy used in the building structure and to identify the opportunities of reduce energy consumptions. In this paper, it is a first time detailed study of energy audit for me. In this research, the object is to find is it necessary to improve the ventilation systems.

The major mission in this thesis is that to make a basic energy audit which is include the heat losses from the building and the heat supply in the building. The major heat losses are transmission losses, ventilation losses, heat losses from hot tap water and infiltration losses. In this project the first three types of heat losses could be find out by some useful methods but the infiltration losses is hard to measure.

40|$|District heating is {{an energy}} {{efficient}} way of providing space heating. The city of Gothenburg {{owns and operates}} a district heating network and heat plants through the company Göteborg Energi. The city of Gothenburg has set out environmental targets {{for the city and}} one of the targets are explored in this thesis. The target states that by 2030 the district heat generation should be free from fossil fuel usage. The goal of this target is in this thesis interpreted as achieving a fossil CO 2 <b>free</b> district <b>heat</b> generation. The CO 2 emissions from waste and excess heat are outside the system boundary. Several scenarios for 2030 are studied, each constructed to explore a possible future. An investment model is run for each scenario. This is done in order to evaluate the robustness and cost efficiency of the studied technologies in a future fossil CO 2 <b>free</b> district <b>heating</b> system. The investments are evaluated from a socio-economic perspective. From the scenario studies it is shown that a fossil CO 2 <b>free</b> district <b>heating</b> system is achievable. It is also shown that large scale thermal storage can be utilized to lower system costs through load shifting seasonal and daily demand variations. Thermal storage can be used to incorporate large amounts of solar heating panels into the system. Furthermore it is shown that care must be taken during the planning of the future district heating system in order to avoid overexposure to the price of fuel. Fossil <b>free</b> <b>heating</b> originate from a few primary energy sources. The price of biomass and/or electricity can heavily influence system costs if alternative technologies are not available to counteract high prices. An increased variability in electricity price can be efficiently utilized through use of heat pumps and CHP technologies.

From the specific radiative intensity they derive , the monochromatic vector flux density of radiation at each point in a region of space, which is equal to the time averaged monochromatic Poynting vector at that point (Mihalas 1978 on pages 9-11).

40|$|<b>Free</b> {{molecular}} <b>heating</b> (FMH) {{is caused}} by the transfer of energy during collisions between the upper atmosphere molecules and a space vehicle. The dispersed <b>free</b> molecular <b>heating</b> on a surface is an important constraint for space vehicle thermal analyses since it can be a significant source of heating. To reduce FMH to a spacecraft, the parking orbit is often designed to a higher altitude at the expense of payload capability. Dispersed FMH is a function of both space vehicle velocity and atmospheric density, however, the space vehicle velocity variations are insignificant when compared to the atmospheric density variations. The density of the upper atmosphere molecules is a function of altitude, but also varies with other environmental factors, such as solar activity, geomagnetic activity, location, and time. A method has been developed to predict three sigma maximum dispersed density for up to 15 years into the future. This method uses a state-of-the-art atmospheric density code, MSIS 86, along with 50 years of solar data, NASA and NOAA solar activity predictions for the next 15 years, and an Aerospace Corporation correlation to account for density code inaccuracies to generate dispersed maximum density ratios denoted as 'K-factors'. The calculated K-factors can be used on a mission unique basis to calculate dispersed density, and hence dispersed <b>free</b> molecular <b>heating</b> rates. These more accurate K-factors can allow lower parking orbit altitudes, resulting in increased payload capability...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} work an experimental-numerical {{approach}} {{is used to}} study the thermo-mechanical behaviour of NiTi wire for defining what parameters {{are the most important}} in actuator designing. Tests were carried out heating, by an electrical current, a wire having a diameter of 150 Pm, under constant stresses of 200 MPa. Data concerning strain, applied current and voltage are acquired during the tests by PC while wire temperature is recorded by thermographic system. The numerical code integrates the ordinary differential equation describing the volumetric wire heating and cooling transients assuming that the electrical power is the only external heating source. Temperature distribution in the wire is considered uniform and its change in time depends on wire specific heat, latent heat of the Martensitic-Austenitic transformation, <b>free</b> convection <b>heat</b> exchange coefficient and total emissivity of the surface wire. Comparisons between experimental and numerical results, obtained under different operating conditions, indicate that the wire heating rate mainly depends on the applied electrical power, latent heat of the Martensitic-Austenitic transformation, <b>free</b> convection <b>heat</b> exchange coefficient. In the case of the cooling transient, the capability to decrease the wire temperature to reach the ambient value is strongly effected, once the <b>free</b> convection <b>heat</b> exchange coefficient is defined, by the shape of the curve representing the Austenitic-Martensitic transformation. Simulations of the wire behaviour point out that the time necessary to obtain the maximum strain can be reduce to few ms if current of 10 A is used. Moreover, the strain dependence on time can be tailored by choosing the suitable heating transient...|$|R
