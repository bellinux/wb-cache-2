5|$|During World War II, {{the trophy}} {{was held by}} 1938 winners Italy. Ottorino Barassi, the Italian {{vice-president}} of FIFA and president of FIGC, secretly transported the trophy from a bank in Rome and hid it in a shoe-box under his bed to prevent Adolf Hitler and the Nazis from taking it. The 1958 FIFA World Cup in Sweden {{marked the beginning of}} a tradition regarding the trophy. As Brazilian captain Hilderaldo Bellini heard photographer requests for a better view of the Jules Rimet Trophy, he lifted <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> air. Every Cup-winning captain ever since has repeated the gesture.|$|E
5|$|Szilard was {{appointed}} as assistant to von Laue at the Institute for Theoretical Physics in 1924. In 1927 {{he finished his}} habilitation and became a Privatdozent (private lecturer) in physics. For his habilitation lecture, he produced a second paper on Maxwell's Demon, Über die Entropieverminderung in einem thermodynamischen System bei Eingriffen intelligenter Wesen (On the reduction of entropy in a thermodynamic system by the intervention of intelligent beings), that had actually been written soon after the first. This introduced the thought experiment now called the Szilard engine and became important {{in the history of}} attempts to understand Maxwell's demon. The paper is also the first equation of negative entropy and information. As such, it established Szilard as {{one of the founders of}} information theory, but he did not publish it until 1929, and did not pursue it further. Claude E. Shannon, who took <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 1950s, acknowledged Szilard's paper as his starting point.|$|E
5|$|Rose and Pete {{drive to}} the wedding together, and the car that had been meant to kill Pete appears and nearly collides with their car. They join the other guests, {{including}} Jackie who has brought the infant Rose with her. Rose is {{surprised to find that}} Jackie and Pete argue frequently. A young Mickey runs in to warn the guests about the Reapers, who think it is a joke until a Reaper appears above and attacks them. The Doctor runs to the church and directs everyone inside, noting that the age of the church will protect them against the Reapers. The Doctor explains to Rose that her actions have caused a paradox that normally the Time Lords would have prevented. Without them, the Reapers are sterilising the wound in time by consuming everyone within it. The Doctor further warns Rose not to touch her infant self, as it could cause further damage to time and allow the Reapers into the church. Feeling that his TARDIS key is still warm, the Doctor sets <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> middle of the church and the TARDIS slowly begins materialising around it.|$|E

25|$|By around 1884, Tasmanian goal umpires {{had begun}} to wave white flags to {{communicate}} with each other about the scoring of goals or behinds.

25|$|The Ravitch {{technique}} is an invasive surgery that {{was introduced in}} 1949 and developed in the 1950s. It involves creating an incision along the chest through which the cartilage is removed and the sternum detached. A small bar is inserted underneath the sternum to hold <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> desired position. The bar is left implanted until the cartilage grows back, typically about six months. The bar is subsequently removed in a simple out-patient procedure; this {{technique is}} thus a two-stage procedure.|$|E

When the sail is first being lifted, it often helps to push the back of the board {{slightly}} underwater, and setting the front of the boom onto the board (near the footstraps). The buoyancy of the board will then push the boom upward, helping to lift the sail out of the water.|$|E

25|$|After his consulship, Marcus Lucullus became {{governor}} (proconsul) of {{the important}} province of Macedonia.

For these achievements, he was awarded a triumph which he held in 71 BC. Part of the booty from this campaign was a colossal statue of Apollo that Marcus Lucullus took from a temple on an island near Apollonia.

25|$|In week 13, the Lions {{traveled}} to Cincinnati, Ohio for a non-conference contest with the Cincinnati Bengals.

Cincinnati then took the lead and didn't give it back when Chad Ochocinco caught a 36-yard TD. The Bengals closed out the first half with a 44-yard field goal by Shayne Graham. In the second half the Bengals scored 2 more field goals, from 39 and 23 yards respectively. The Lions scored the game's final points late in the 4th quarter with a 2-yard run by Kevin Smith.

Opener Javed Omar, captain Habibul Bashar and Aftab Ahmed all made half-centuries as it was touch and go as to whether England would wrap <b>it</b> <b>up</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> two days. When the seventh wicket fell at 245 in the last over of normal play, it allowed England to claim the extra half-hour. But only one more wicket fell as Bangladesh restored some pride.
