5|$|The Second World War brought renewed prosperity, despite {{extensive}} {{bombing of}} cities by the Luftwaffe. <b>It</b> <b>saw</b> {{the invention of}} radar by Robert Watson-Watt, which was invaluable in the Battle of Britain, as was the leadership at RAF Fighter Command of Air Chief Marshal Hugh Dowding.|$|E

60|$|Bradley Headstone caught hold of {{a pillar}} behind him. If Mr Milvey knew an ashy face when he <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> he <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> then.|$|R

60|$|She {{had been}} {{listening}} before she knocked! I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her white face, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her trembling hands, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in her look at Laura.|$|R

After the Korean War, it was {{reactivated}} as a brigade, and was returned to the United States where <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> action in Operation Just Cause and Operation Golden Pheasant. The 2nd Brigade was sent to quell civil unrest resulting from the 1992 Los Angeles Riots. The brigade was finally deactivated in 1993.|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{tell you}} I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself," [...] said a fat man, {{with a bunch}} of newly-purchased leeks in his hand. [...] "I was in Santa Maria Novella, and <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself. The woman started up and threw out her arms, and cried out and said she saw a big bull with fiery horns coming down on the church to crush <b>it.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> myself." ...|$|R
60|$|And then <b>it</b> {{was they}} <b>saw</b> <b>it.</b> Nettie, the younger Miss Bunting, <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> first. She pointed, she says, {{before she could}} find words to speak. Then they all <b>saw</b> <b>it!</b> Miss Glendower, I believe, was {{the person who was}} last to see it. At any rate it would have been like her if she had been.|$|R

5|$|Current historiography {{developed}} in the 20th century; led by authors such as Joseph Vogt, <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> in slavery the conditions {{for the development of}} elites. Conversely, the theory also demonstrates an opportunity for slaves to join the elite. Finally, Vogt estimates that modern society, founded on humanist values, has surpassed this level of development.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{its time}} of development, Arena is {{in certain areas}} a {{relatively}} modern browser; because it functioned as a testbed, <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> the implementation of new technologies long before they became mainstream, e.g. CSS. Arena implemented many elements of the HTML3 and HTML3.2 specification including math elements that were deprecated in HTML4, HTML tables, and experimental style sheets.|$|E
5|$|From 1749 to the 1760s, Fort Chambray {{was built}} on the island of Gozo. It was {{intended}} to be a new fortified city like Valletta, and eventually to replace the Cittadella as the island's capital. This was unsuccessful, and eventually only the fort was built. <b>It</b> <b>saw</b> some action during the French occupation of 1798, but its importance eventually diminished. It was converted into a hospital in the 19th century. In the 1990s, the interior of the fort began to be redeveloped, but the outer bastions and some barracks remain intact.|$|E
5|$|Hays {{died before}} {{he could see the}} GTP through to completion.

60|$|I was there, and I <b>saw</b> <b>it,</b> too; <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> all, {{just as he}} {{pictures}} it. And I see it yetthe little battle-ax, the dainty plumed cap, {{the white}} armorall in the soft June afternoon; I see it just {{as if it were}} yesterday. And I rode with the staffthe personal staffthe staff of Joan of Arc.|$|R

5|$|Hifz-ur Rahman {{was laid}} up in Constantinople. She was refit at the Imperial Arsenal in 18911894, but was {{nevertheless}} in poor condition by {{the outbreak of}} the Greco-Turkish War in February 1897, {{like the rest of the}} ancient Ottoman ironclad fleet. As a result, the fleet was kept safely behind the Dardanelles forts and <b>it</b> <b>saw</b> no action. The ship remained in service for another decade until she was decommissioned in 1909; she was sold in November that year to ship breakers and thereafter dismantled.|$|E
5|$|Oil {{reserves}} {{discovered in}} the later 20th century in the seas both east and west of Shetland have provided a much-needed alternative {{source of income for}} the islands.

A Japanese release was planned to follow the North American release by a few months, but was ultimately cancelled.|$|E
60|$|I mean {{to speak}} of {{only one of these}} many world-renowned buildings, the Taj Mahal, the most celebrated {{construction}} in the earth. I had read a great deal too much about <b>it.</b> I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the daytime, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> in the moonlight, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> near at hand, I <b>saw</b> <b>it</b> from a distance; and I knew all the time, that of its kind it was the wonder of THE world, with no competitor now and no possible future competitor; and yet, it was not MY Taj. My Taj had been built by excitable literary people; it was solidly lodged in my head, and I could not blast it out.|$|R
