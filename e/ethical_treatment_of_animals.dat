Even though people's opinion may differ {{in regards to the}} world's largest animal rights organization PETA (People for the <b>Ethical</b> <b>Treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>Animal)</b> (Kulkarni, 2009), the organization asks a relevant question: “ If your cat tasted like chicken would you eat her?” As I work within the contemporary art jewellery field, it is through the body, jewellery, and the conscious act of wearing it, that I would like to encourage consumers to reflect on their personal meat consumption and to connect the packaged meat to the animal it comes from: what is it that we are eating? Where does it come from? Through this essay and my work/practice, I aim to critically reflect on the different existing values between animals in our society and to inspire more conscious and well informed decisions concerning meat. This essay is a research project prior to my practical exam work at the Jewellery + Corpus Master program at Konstfack and will serve as a basis for my artistic exam work. Against this background, I look at relevant literature and case studies representative of the field of contemporary art jewellery, in order to research/address the following question in this essay: -          Is it possible to discuss complex questions within society though the media of contemporary art jewellery?  Within the field, opinions differ between art historians as well as makers; it seems that the framework of contemporary art jewellery provides the medium, on one side, with great potential to speak of issues within society, although, on the other side, the same frame work commonly hinders the medium’s ability {{to reach out to the}} general public, in order to generate a wider discussion. ...|$|R

30|$|Experimental animal {{models have}} been created and refined for over 80  years to {{investigate}} the development, management, and <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> sepsis [1], and have contributed to many important advances {{in our understanding of}} sepsis pathophysiology [2]. Recognizing the ethical implications <b>of</b> using <b>animals</b> in research, the “ 3 Rs”—Replacement, Refinement, and Reduction—form the guiding principles for ethical standards when conducting animal research [3]. These guidelines exclude death as an endpoint, and suggest the use of surrogate markers of death to establish humane endpoints where possible. Surrogate markers of death involve using criteria related to pain, suffering, and/or illness, such as clinically relevant scoring systems that semi-quantitatively assess the physical appearance and/or behavior <b>of</b> an <b>animal</b> [4 – 6], in order to gauge the time at which animals should be humanely euthanized [7]. These decisions must be carefully balanced with minimizing premature termination <b>of</b> <b>animal</b> studies, which may lead to incomplete observations and may necessitate use <b>of</b> even more <b>animals</b> [7, 8]. Improvements are necessary to achieve more <b>ethical</b> and humane <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> <b>animals</b> in research related to critical care medicine [7, 9, 10], and specifically for experimental sepsis research [10], where clear endpoint markers have not been established for the gold standard sepsis model of cecal ligation and puncture (CLP).|$|R
40|$|There is {{consistency}} in the location of biologically active points (BAP) in humans and animals, so it is as-sumed that the morphological changes after acupuncture in experimental animals are identical to changes in humans. Most often the experiments are made on rats, using various methods of fixing to ensure immo-bility during the impact in biologically active points. The {{aim of this study}} is to develop a method for im-mobilization <b>of</b> experimental <b>animals,</b> meeting the requirements of our experiments, in order to demon-strate the morphological changes that occur after acupuncture and to define the optimal conditions for its application. The fixing of the experimental rats can be made with available materials or a special clamp. The used spac-ers for the experimental rats are basically two types- using a transparent tube and not using a transparent tube. On some animals prior anesthesia is made. After repeated application of a fixative developed by us we reached the following conclusions: 1. The fixing with a transparent tube without the use of anesthesia cre-ates optimal conditions for experiments with needle-pricking of a rat. 2. For immobilization <b>of</b> experimen-tal <b>animals</b> without the use of a tube, prior general anesthetic is required in order to avoid straining of the skeletal muscles and trauma on the psyche <b>of</b> the <b>animal.</b> Today’s trend is to create minimum traumatic conditions for animal fixation without the use of pre-anes-thesia.

40|$|Post-colonial {{attitudes to}} nature {{in many parts}} of Australia and {{elsewhere}} have ensured the human/ native animal divide has remained strong among institutions charged with managing the way society interacts with the natural environment. Rules have taken over principles, and conservation (decisions about too many and too few), not welfare, has become the dominant discourse. Anthropocentric institutionalism has replaced moral geography and ethical understanding {{when it comes to the}} connection between native animals and communities. While some of the blame for this situation results from power wielding institutional regulators, a failure to define and articulate a coherent ethical underpinning to animal welfare that is not anthropocentric has contributed to this situation more broadly. This has ensured that in an increasingly urbanised society, the psycho-emotional distance between humans and native animals, if anything, is increased locking-in a range of societal fears, encouraging vested interests, and enabling animal cruelty. There is a discussion to be had about the way geographic space is configured that includes animals and humans that has serious implications for issues of community fragmentation and its associated problems in a globalising world. This relational view about humans and native animals also has implications for animal welfare, where the discourse has been to maintain the separation, focus on ‘rights’, and differing anthropocentric views about distress. We argue such approaches miss the ‘intrinsic’ characteristics and mutual benefits that a co-habitation model built on respect can bring. In this paper we discuss three interrelated engagement aspects with respect to the way we view the human/ native animal divide from an ethical perspective. First, we are concerned to address limitations in animal welfare discourse to ensure it is not suppressed by anthropocentric arguments and the conservation agenda. We articulate a relational ethic predicated on mutual understanding and respect as a framework for achieving this. Second, there are implications for the design and occupation of community space to ensure fragmentation pressures are minimised. There is evidence around the world where human/ nature connections in urban living are being ‘re-invented’. Third, because they are places of learning, are autonomous with a hoped for concern for the public good and the well-being of humans and non-humans, and may have access to large areas of land, we can identify an engagement role for universities in meaningfully contributing to strengthening nonhuman engagement in communities. While some universities see their ethical contribution to the public good in relation to native animals in ‘funding-conditional’ terms, or in tinkering with animals for human benefit, at least one, which we report on in this paper, sees it has a responsibility to the <b>ethical</b> <b>treatment</b> <b>of</b> the native <b>animals</b> that are a characteristic feature of its campus...|$|R
