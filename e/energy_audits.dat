25|$|One of {{the primary}} ways to improve energy {{conservation}} in buildings is to use an energy audit. An energy audit is an inspection and analysis of energy use and flows for energy conservation in a building, process or system {{to reduce the amount}} of energy input into the system without negatively affecting the output(s). This is normally accomplished by trained professionals and can be part of some of the national programs discussed above. In addition, recent development of smartphone apps enable homeowners to complete relatively sophisticated <b>energy</b> <b>audits</b> themselves.|$|E

Specifically within the United States, over-illumination is responsible for approximately two {{million barrels of oil}} per day in energy wasted. This is based upon U.S. consumption of equivalent of [...] of petroleum. It is further noted in the same U.S. Department of Energy source that over 30% of all primary energy is consumed by commercial, industrial and residential sectors. <b>Energy</b> <b>audits</b> of existing buildings demonstrate that the lighting component of residential, commercial and industrial uses consumes about 20–40% of those land uses, variable with region and land use. (Residential use lighting consumes only 10–30% of the energy bill while commercial buildings' major use is lighting.) Thus lighting energy accounts for about four or five million barrels of oil (equivalent) per day. Again energy audit data demonstrates that about 30–60% of energy consumed in lighting is unneeded or gratuitous.|$|E
