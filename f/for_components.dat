25|$|Often, {{through-hole}} and surface-mount construction must {{be combined}} {{in a single}} assembly because some required components are available only in surface-mount packages, while others are available only in through-hole packages. Another reason to use both methods is that through-hole mounting can provide needed strength <b>for</b> <b>components</b> likely to endure physical stress, while components {{that are expected to}} go untouched will take up less space using surface-mount techniques.|$|E

25|$|As with SOFCs, MCFC {{disadvantages}} include slow start-up {{times because}} of their high operating temperature. This makes MCFC systems not suitable for mobile applications, and this technology {{will most likely be}} used for stationary fuel cell purposes. The main challenge of MCFC technology is the cells' short life span. The high-temperature and carbonate electrolyte lead to corrosion of the anode and cathode. These factors accelerate the degradation of MCFC components, decreasing the durability and cell life. Researchers are addressing this problem by exploring corrosion-resistant materials <b>for</b> <b>components</b> as well as fuel cell designs that may increase cell life without decreasing performance.|$|E
25|$|There {{are eight}} types of XP (XP-A through XP-G), plus a variant type (XP-V), all {{categorized}} {{based on the}} genetic cause. XP {{can be caused by}} mutations in any of these genes: DDB2, ERCC2, ERCC3, ERCC4, ERCC5, XPA, XPC. These genes are all involved in the NER repair pathway that repairs damaged DNA. The variant form, XP-V, is caused by mutations in the POLH gene, which unlike the rest does not code <b>for</b> <b>components</b> of the NER pathway but produces a DNA polymerase that allows accurate translesion synthesis of DNA damage resulting from UV radiation; its mutation leads to an overall increase in UV-dependent mutation, which ultimately causes the symptoms of XP.|$|E

25|$|Most modern {{oscilloscopes}} {{have several}} inputs for voltages, {{and thus can}} be used to plot one varying voltage versus another. This is especially useful for graphing I-V curves (current versus voltage characteristics) <b>for</b> <b>components</b> such as diodes, as well Lissajous patterns. Lissajous figures are an example of how an oscilloscope {{can be used to}} track phase differences between multiple input signals. This is very frequently used in broadcast engineering to plot the left and right stereophonic channels, to ensure that the stereo generator is calibrated properly. Historically, stable Lissajous figures were used to show that two sine waves had a relatively simple frequency relationship, a numerically-small ratio. They also indicated phase difference between two sine waves of the same frequency.|$|E
25|$|A logical {{scheme is}} to produce {{resistors}} {{in a range of}} values which increase in a geometric progression, so that each value is greater than its predecessor by a fixed multiplier or percentage, chosen to match the tolerance of the range. For example, for a tolerance of ±20% it makes sense to have each resistor about 1.5 times its predecessor, covering a decade in 6 values. In practice the factor used is 1.4678, giving values of 1.47, 2.15, 3.16, 4.64, 6.81, 10 for the 1–10-decade (a decade is a range increasing by a factor of 10; 0.1–1 and 10–100 are other examples); these are rounded in practice to 1.5, 2.2, 3.3, 4.7, 6.8, 10; followed, by 15, 22, 33, … and preceded by … 0.47, 0.68, 1. This scheme has been adopted as the E48 series of the IEC 60063 preferred number values. There are also E12, E24, E48, E96 and E192 series <b>for</b> <b>components</b> of progressively finer resolution, with 12, 24, 96, and 192 different values within each decade. The actual values used are in the IEC 60063 lists of preferred numbers.|$|E
25|$|Materials {{for wind}} turbine parts {{other than the}} rotor blades (including the rotor hub, gearbox, frame, and tower) are largely {{composed}} of steel. Modern turbines uses a couple of tonnes of copper for generators, cables and such. Smaller wind turbines have begun incorporating more aluminum based alloys into these components {{in an effort to}} make the turbines more lightweight and efficient, and may continue to be used increasingly if fatigue and strength properties can be improved. Prestressed concrete has been increasingly used for the material of the tower, but still, requires much reinforcing steel to meet the strength requirement of the turbine. Additionally, step-up gearboxes are being increasingly replaced with variable speed generators, increasing the demand for magnetic materials in wind turbines., In particular, this would require an increased supply of the rare earth metal neodymium. Reliance on rare earth minerals <b>for</b> <b>components</b> has risked expense and price volatility as China has been main producer of rare earth minerals (96% in 2009) and had been reducing its export quotas of these materials. In recent years, however, other producers have increased production of rare earth minerals and China has removed its reduced export quota on rare earths leading to an increased supply and decreased cost of rare earth minerals, increasing the viability of the implementation of variable speed generators in wind turbines on a large scale.|$|E

A New Jersey fashion designer that Hsu had listed as a co-investor, said he had never heard of Hsu.

500|$|No.30 Communications Unit was {{headquartered}} at Iwakuni, {{along with}} the rest of No.91 Wing's components except No.77 Squadron, which was based on the Korean peninsula. It was initially commanded, unofficially, by Flight Lieutenant (later Air Commodore) Dave Hitchens. According to Hitchens, [...] "Having commanded the communications flight in No. 77 Squadron, I assumed control but had no formal authority to do so, but nobody told me to stop." [...] The transport aircraft included the personal Dakota of the BCOF commander, Lieutenant General Sir Horace Robertson, operating under his direction. [...] During November 1950, the unit received another four Dakotas from No.38 Squadron (of No.90 (Composite) Wing in Malaya), giving it a total strength of eight Dakotas and two Austers. It supported all Australian forces in Korea. One of its key functions was medical evacuation, but it was also responsible for supply drops, search and rescue, reconnaissance, and mail delivery, as well as transporting cargo, troops, and VIPs. Unlike No.77 Squadron, it was not tasked by the US Fifth Air Force but instead operated under Australian control, exercised through BCOF headquarters in Japan. In December 1950 the unit undertook [...] "Operation Haggis", the delivery of [...] of haggis to the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders based in Suwon, Korea. The same month, a United States Air Force Mustang taking off from Suwon smashed into the cockpit of one of the Dakotas; none of the Australian crew was injured but the aircraft had to be written off and stripped <b>for</b> <b>components</b> by No.491 Squadron.|$|E
