5|$|Full-featured USB3.1 Type-C cables are {{electronically}} marked cables {{that contain}} {{a full set}} of wires and a chip with an ID function based on the configuration <b>data</b> <b>channel</b> and vendor-defined messages (VDMs) from the USB Power Delivery 2.0 specification. USB Type-C devices also support power currents of 1.5A and 3.0A over the 5V power bus in addition to baseline 900mA; devices can either negotiate increased USB current through the configuration line or they can support the full Power Delivery specification using both BMC-coded configuration line and legacy BFSK-coded VBUS line.|$|E
5|$|The Power Delivery Specification defines six fixed power {{profiles}} for {{the power}} sources. PD-aware devices implement a flexible power management scheme by interfacing with the power source through a bidirectional <b>data</b> <b>channel</b> and requesting {{a certain level of}} electrical power, variable up to 5A and 20V depending on supported profile. The power configuration protocol uses a 24MHz BFSK-coded transmission channel on the VBUS line.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a simple technique {{to design a}} phase-modulated residual carrier communications link for optimum performance. The emphasis is on two <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> which are operated simultaneously with a ranging signal. The <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> employ PCM/PM and PCM/PSK/PM modulation schemes for high and low <b>data</b> rate <b>channels,</b> respectively. The technique proposed here selects the optimum (1) subcarrier frequency to minimize the interference between the two <b>data</b> <b>channels,</b> and (2) modulation indices for optimum {{balance of power between}} the two telemetry <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> and the coherent turn around ranging channel. The selected set of optimum modulation indices will allow for the specified bit error rate (BER) degradations in the two <b>data</b> <b>channels.</b> Although this technique is proposed to optimize the performance degradation for two <b>data</b> <b>channels,</b> generalizations can be made for more than two <b>data</b> <b>channels...</b>|$|R
30|$|Another trend we {{can observe}} from Figure  11 {{is that the}} {{throughput}} increases significantly with the lifting number of <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> and the average energy consumption decrease monotonically. Further, {{with the increase of}} the number of <b>data</b> <b>channels,</b> the system will approach the ideal case of zero propagation delay and achieve better throughput and energy efficiency. For example, when the number of <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> is 4, the throughput gap between the actual system and the ideal system is 1.1 kbps. When the number of <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> increases to 32, this gap is reduced to 0.2 kbps. This result suggests that the impact of long propagation delays can be alleviated by increasing the number of <b>data</b> <b>channels.</b>|$|R

Power Delivery protocols have been updated to facilitate Type-C features such as cable ID function, Alternate Mode negotiation, increased VBUS currents, and VCONN-powered accessories.|$|E
25|$|RDRAM was a {{proprietary}} technology that competed against DDR. Its relatively high price and disappointing performance (resulting from high latencies and a narrow 16-bit <b>data</b> <b>channel</b> versus DDR's 64 bit channel) {{caused it to}} lose the race to succeed SDR DRAM.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{medium access control}} (MAC) {{protocol}} for single-hop WDM star-coupler networks, in which the number of stations {{is larger than the}} number of channels and the stations have arbitrary distances to the star coupler. The proposed protocol has one control channel for reserving the slots of <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> and several <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> which are used to transmit tra#c. This paper also suggests a scheme that accomplishes load balancing among <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> for arbitrary traffic patterns between stations. Since this load balancing scheme diminishes an influence that tra#c patterns have on the performance of the proposed MAC protocol, the proposed system is appropriate for systems which have asymmetric tra#c intensity between stations. Throughput and mean message delay of the MAC protocol are analyzed using a discrete time Markov process and a D/G/ 1 queue with batch arrivals. The numerical results show that the performance is improved as the message length increases, the maximum round-trip propagation delay decreases, and the number of <b>data</b> <b>channels</b> increases...|$|R
