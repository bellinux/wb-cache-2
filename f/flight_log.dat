5|$|During World War II, {{service members}} {{continued}} the hoax, with Burdell's name appearing on various fronts. For example, he was {{listed on the}} flight crew of a B-17 bomber, flying twelve missions over Europe with the 8th Air Force in England, until a Georgia Tech graduate became the new operations officer, recognized {{the name on the}} <b>flight</b> <b>log,</b> and ended the charade.|$|E
5|$|MacLachlan {{travelled}} {{to flight}} schools across America. In November {{he flew to}} Orlando, Florida and across to Galveston, Texas near Palm Beach. The lecturing tour took him to Los Angeles California {{at the end of}} 1942. By January 1943 he had also visited Arizona and Texas. His <b>flight</b> <b>log</b> had expanded throughout this period to include a variety of types. Using his privileged position he flew the Curtiss P-40 Warhawk, Lockheed P-38 Lightning and Republic P-47 Thunderbolt. Through flying MacLachlan felt the urge to participate in combat operations again but he enjoyed American hospitality immensely. In February he flew at an aerobatic show in Mesa, Arizona. On 18 February 1943 MacLachlan had a close call. While flying from Fort Stockton to El Paso, he force-landed in the desert when he ran out of fuel. According to a legend, MacLachaln used a local pipeline to fill the tanks. While in America he undertook several public relations tours and met movie stars such as Orson Wells and Joan Fontaine when he visited Hollywood for autographed photo-shoots.|$|E

25|$|He {{was posted}} to Fliegerkompagnie 1 (Flik 1) at Czernowitz, {{commanded}} by Hauptmann Otto Jindra, in July 1915; von Brumowski was thus initially assigned as an aerial observer on the Russian Front.

Tereshkova also maintained a <b>flight</b> <b>log</b> and took photographs of the horizon, which were later used to identify aerosol layers within the atmosphere.|$|E

25|$|ARJ21-700 AC104 of Commercial Aircraft Corporation of China, Ltd. (COMAC) {{returned}} to China safely on April 28, 2014 after successfully completing natural icing flight testing in North America. This {{was the first}} time a turbofan-powered regional jet independently developed by China had flown abroad to carry out flight tests in special weather conditions. In the meantime, the fleet of ARJ21-700 test aircraft has achieved a global <b>flight</b> <b>log</b> of more than 30,000km across Asia, America, Europe, and the Pacific and Atlantic oceans. This success of the ARJ21-700 in natural icing flight testing has cleared another obstacle toward airworthiness certification, and proven access and feasibility for China’s civil aircraft to carry out flight testing abroad.|$|E
25|$|The {{technical}} log {{for the flight}} indicated that the co-pilot was pilot flying (PF) for the flight. The CVR and ATC recordings also indicate that the co-pilot was PF during the flight. Furthermore, injuries sustained by the co-pilot to his right hand are consistent with his having been handling the aircraft {{at the time of}} impact. As no autopilot or flight director (FD) was fitted, the PF was under a high workload throughout the flight. This was especially so as three approaches were made in poor weather to below minima with two go-arounds. Normally the PF handles both flight and engine controls in a coordinated manner to achieve the required flight path; the PNF carries out other tasks including monitoring the aircraft's flight path, radio communications and keeping the <b>flight</b> <b>log.</b> The CVR indicates that the commander (PNF) took control of the power levers during final approach, this action being acknowledged by the PF. This was significant, as both power levers were subsequently retarded below Flight Idle – an action which would have been unexpected by the PF.|$|E
25|$|Metallurgist Terry Heaslip of the Canadian company Accident Investigation and Research Inc. {{examined}} the aircraft {{skin from the}} tail and found signs of overheating, specifically that the skin had been repeatedly flexed, through a phenomenon known as flutter. This caused investigators to further scrutinize {{the tail of the}} aircraft. Furthermore, the investigation team found that the Auxiliary Power Unit (APU), which was in the tail, generated heat which melted certain plastic parts, indicating that the APU was operating during the flight even though it normally would not be. The mechanic who had inspected the aircraft {{on the day of the}} accident flight told the investigators that one of the aircraft's two main generators had failed and that he was not able to repair the faulty generator. The investigators discovered that the pilots had noted in the <b>flight</b> <b>log</b> that they operated the APU during the flight, since two power sources are required for flight. They also discovered that the front APU mount was broken, which allowed it to vibrate excessively.|$|E

2500|$|The project coordinators (including book {{publisher}} and publicist George P. Putnam) interviewed Earhart {{and asked her}} to accompany pilot Wilmer Stultz and copilot/mechanic Louis Gordon on the flight, nominally as a passenger, but with the added duty of keeping the <b>flight</b> <b>log.</b> The team departed from Trepassey Harbor, Newfoundland, in a Fokker F.VIIb/3m on June 17, 1928, landing at Pwll near Burry Port, South Wales, exactly 20 hours and 40 minutes later. There is a commemorative blue plaque at the site. Since most of the flight was on instruments and Earhart had no training for this type of flying, she did not pilot the aircraft. When interviewed after landing, she said, [...] "Stultz did all the flying—had to. I was just baggage, like a sack of potatoes." [...] She added, [...] "... maybe someday I'll try it alone." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>Flight</b> <b>logs</b> {{released}} in September 2004 {{in response to}} a lawsuit (see below) showed that Bush, who had been flying in the F-102A Delta Dagger, a single-seater interceptor, for most of his career, flew nine times in T-33 trainers in February and March 1972 – nearly twice as many times as he had flown in T-33s in the prior 18 months. The logs also show that on March 12 and April 10 of 1972, Bush took two passes to land his F-102 fighter. [...] Although White House officials could not explain the changes in the <b>flight</b> <b>logs</b> in these final flights, Air Force experts said there could be any of a number of reasons for the change in Bush's flight pattern. Retired Major General Paul A. Weaver, a former head of the Air National Guard, said Bush could have just been practicing landing skills. [...] "It doesn't mean anything to have multiple approaches," [...] Weaver said.|$|R
