By using B100, these generators were able to essentially eliminate the byproducts that result in smog, ozone, and sulfur emissions. The use of these generators in residential areas around schools, hospitals, and the general public result in substantial reductions in poisonous carbon monoxide and particulate matter.|$|E
25|$|London Mayor Sadiq Khan {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} the scheme on 17 February 2017 after London achieved record air pollution levels in January 2017, and the city was put on very <b>high</b> <b>pollution</b> alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles. The Mayor also announced plans to expand the London ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) beyond Central London a year earlier than planned in 2019. Motor vehicles that do not meet the emissions criteria would be charged from £12.50 upwards a day to enter central London. Drivers would not pay both the ULEZ and the new £10 T-charge, and the latter will not apply to taxis.|$|E
25|$|In February 2017, London Mayor Sadiq Khan {{announced}} {{the introduction of}} a new £10 toxicity charge, known as T-charge to be introduced from 23 October 2017, after London achieved record air pollution levels in January 2017, and the city was put on very <b>high</b> <b>pollution</b> alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles. The T-charge is to be levied to drive within Central London on top of the £11.50 congestion charge. The Mayor also announced plans to expand the ultra low emission zone (ULEZ) in 2019 beyond Central London, one year ahead of schedule, levying a £12 charge a day for polluting vehicles to enter central London.

500|$|A new {{toxicity}} charge, {{known as}} T-charge was introduced from 23 October 2017.

The charge typically applies to diesel and petrol vehicles registered before 2006, and the levy is expected to affect up to 10,000 vehicles. London Mayor Sadiq Khan announced the introduction of the scheme in February 2017 after London achieved record air pollution levels the previous month, and the city was put on very <b>high</b> <b>pollution</b> alert for the first time ever, as cold and stationary weather failed to clear toxic pollutants emitted mainly by diesel vehicles.|$|E

40|$|Multivariate {{statistical}} method including cluster analysis (CA) {{was used to}} assess temporal and spatial variations in the water quality of Euphrates River, Iraq, for a period 2008 - 2009 using 16 parameters at 11 sampling sites. Hierarchical CA grouped the 8 months into three periods (I, II and III) and classified the 11 sampling sites into two groups (I and II) based on similarities of water quality characteristics. The temporal pattern shows that April has <b>higher</b> <b>pollution</b> level relative to the other months. Spatially, sampling site 7 (S 7) has lower pollution level while the other sampling sites have <b>higher</b> <b>pollution</b> level. Thus, this study shows usefulness of cluster analysis method for analyzing and interpreting of surface water dataset to assess the temporal and spatial variations in the water quality parameters and the optimization of regional water quality sampling network...|$|R

40|$|The {{environmental}} impact was studied due to water consumption and pollution loading from white shrimp culture at various shrimp farm scales. Field observation and in-depth interviews {{were carried out}} in 19 selected shrimp farms. The 38 water samples and 19 sediment samples from the shrimp farms from January–October, 2013 were analyzed and determined for their pollution loading from the wastewater and sediment discharged from the culture ponds. The results showed that for the same production, small-scale farms generated the <b>highest</b> <b>pollution</b> loading in wastewater and sediment, with respective values of per tonne production of 21. 95  kg total Kjeldahl nitrogen and 1. 12  kg total Kjeldahl nitrogen, 18. 36  g Pb and 3. 63  g Pb and 31. 30  g As and 1. 94  g As. However, for any-sized farm, the average total suspended solids and ammonia nitrogen of effluent from harvesting could not pass the Thai Effluent Standard for Coastal Aquaculture. In large-scale farms, the <b>highest</b> <b>pollution</b> loading per tonne production in wastewater discharged was 12. 55  g Cu, while the <b>highest</b> <b>pollution</b> loadings per tonne production from the sediment generated were 20. 98  kg organic matter, 0. 079  g Cd and 26. 65  g Cu. The large-scale farms used the highest proportion of refilled water (45. 90 %) and generated the highest amount of effluent during culture (39. 26 %). Only large-scale farms could manage their own control of water use to reduce {{environmental impact}}s. These results will be used further to determine the sustainability of shrimp farms at various scales...|$|R

50|$|Marketable {{allowances}} are {{a regulatory}} approach that allows companies {{to buy and}} sell pollution rights. This type of regulation uses market forces to ensure that pollution is reduced in the least costly manner to the polluter.

These companies would then sell their allowances to other companies for whom such reductions would be more expensive.|$|R
40|$|In {{a dynamic}} {{model of a}} risk-neutral {{competitive}} firm which can lower its pollution emissions per unit of output by building up abatement capital stock, we {{examine the effect of}} a <b>higher</b> <b>pollution</b> tax rate on abatement investment both under full certainty and when the timing or the size of the tax increase is uncertain. We show that a <b>higher</b> <b>pollution</b> tax encourages abatement investment if it does not exceed a certain threshold rate - a "Laffer-curve" phenomenon. When the size of the tax increase is uncertain, {{at the time of the}} tax increase the abatement investment path may shift upward or downward depending on whether the actual tax rate is higher or lower than the firm's expected rate. But, when the time of the tax increase is uncertain, the abatement investment path always jumps upward. Further, the ad hoc practice of raising the discount rate to account for the uncertainty leads to underinvestment in abatement capital. We show how the size of this underinvestment bias varies with the future tax increase. Finally, we show that a credible threat to accelerate the tax increase can induce the firm to undertake more abatement investment...|$|R
