In 1917, following the United States' entry into World War I, {{he went to work}} with the National Research Council.

Brusca also quoted Riina as declaring that the children of informants were legitimate targets.

25|$|Smallholders’ lump is {{produced}} by smallholders who collect rubber from trees far from the nearest factory. Many Indonesian smallholders, who farm paddies in remote areas, tap dispersed trees {{on their way to}} work in the paddy fields and collect the latex (or the coagulated latex) on their way home. As it is often impossible to preserve the latex sufficiently to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> a factory that processes latex in time for it to be used to make high quality products, and as the latex would anyway have coagulated by the time it reached the factory, the smallholder will coagulate it by any means available, in any container available. Some smallholders use small containers, buckets etc., but often the latex is coagulated in holes in the ground, which are usually lined with plastic sheeting. Acidic materials and fermented fruit juices are used to coagulate the latex— a form of assisted biological coagulation. Little care is taken to exclude twigs, leaves, and even bark from the lumps that are formed, which may also include tree lace.|$|E
25|$|Lutyens {{campaigned for}} its fixing, {{but was not}} able to <b>get</b> <b>it</b> <b>to</b> be changed. Lutyens wanted to make a long {{inclined}} grade all the way to Viceroy's House with retaining walls on either side. While this would give a view of the house from further back, it would also cut through the square between the secretariat buildings. The committee with Lutyens and Baker established in January 1914 said the grade was to be no steeper than 1 in 25, though it eventually was changed to 1 in 22, a steeper gradient which made it more difficult to see the Viceroy's palace. While Lutyens knew about the gradient, and the possibility that the Viceroy's palace would be obscured by the road, it is thought that Lutyens did not fully realize how little {{the front of the house}} would be visible. In 1916 the Imperial Delhi committee dismissed Lutyens's proposal to alter the gradient. Lutyens thought Baker was more concerned with making money and pleasing the government, rather than making a good architectural design.|$|E

[...] However, he was busy starring in The Sound and the Fury, and they could not negotiate his release from Twentieth-Century Fox.

[...] It {{was one of the first}} scenes cut during editing: the original version was over three hours, Lee was less interested in the story's romance, and Thompson found a kissing scene to be inappropriate. The scene was included in marketing materials and the film trailer. Thompson and Doran also cut out a scene depicting Willoughby as remorseful when Marianne is sick.

500|$|While the Windows and Xbox 360 {{versions}} of The Orange Box were developed {{and published by}} Valve, {{the development of the}} PlayStation 3 port was outsourced to Electronic Arts.

[...] "We'd stop if we thought we were just going through the motions... I think that has a lot to do with the songs – if they were inferior, then maybe we would have got tired of it all.
