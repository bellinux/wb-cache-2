5|$|Further {{neurological}} examinations {{are crucial}} in {{the differential diagnosis}} of AD and other diseases. Interviews with family members are also utilised <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> of the disease. Caregivers can supply important information on the daily living abilities, {{as well as on}} the decrease, over time, of the person's mental function. A caregiver's viewpoint is particularly important, since a person with AD is commonly unaware of his own deficits. Many times, families also have difficulties in the detection of initial dementia symptoms and may not communicate accurate information to a physician.|$|E
5|$|In {{the opinion}} of the Moscow Helsinki Group {{chairwoman}} Lyudmila Alexeyeva, the attribution of a mental illness to a prominent figure who came out with a political declaration or action is the most significant factor <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> of psychiatry during the 1960–1980s. The practice of forced confinement of political dissidents in psychiatric facilities in the former USSR and Eastern Europe destroyed the credibility of psychiatric practice in these countries. When psychiatric profession is discredited {{in one part of the}} world, psychiatry is discredited throughout the world. Psychiatry lost its professional basis entirely with its abuse to stifle dissidence in the former USSR and in the so-called euthanasia program in Nazi Germany. There is little doubt that the capacity for using psychiatry to enforce social norms and even political interests is immense. Now psychiatry is vulnerable because many of its notions have been questioned, and the sustainable pattern of mental life, of boundaries of mental norm and abnormality has been lost, director of the Moscow Research Institute for Psychiatry Valery Krasnov says, adding that psychiatrists have to seek new reference points to make clinical assessments and new reference points to justify old therapeutical interventions.|$|E
5|$|Nigel {{also served}} as a royal justice under Henry II. Although his {{relations}} with the government had improved, his relations with the monks of his cathedral chapter, which had never been good, continued to be marked by quarrels. In 1156, the English Pope Adrian IV threatened to suspend Nigel from office unless the bishop restored all the lands that had belonged to the church when Nigel became bishop. The restitution was hampered by the absence of the king from England, and the dispute dragged on until finally it was resolved by Nigel pledging in front of Theobald of Bec, Archbishop of Canterbury, to restore the lands. By 1158, Nigel had managed to restore enough possessions that Adrian relaxed the conditions. Even this did not end the quarrels with the monks, as Nigel then named a married clerk as sacrist of Ely, an action which was condemned by Thomas Becket, the new Archbishop of Canterbury. Nigel did manage to secure a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> of knight's fees due from the diocese, from the 60fees that were due under Henry I, to 40 in 1166.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: To {{determine}} the responsiveness of the domain climbing up and going down stairs of the Functional Evaluation Scale for Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy (FES-DMD-D 3) in a one-year follow-up study. Method: The study included 26 patients with DMD. Effect Size (ES) and Standardized Response Mean (SRM) described the scale&# 8217;s responsiveness. Results: For climbing up stairs, ES showed that responsiveness was low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 26; 0. 35; 0. 13; 0. 17), low to moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> six-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 58; 0. 48; 0. 33), moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 70; 0. 68), and high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 -month <b>assessment</b> (0. 88). SRM showed that responsiveness was low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 29; 0. 38; 0. 18; and 0. 19), low to moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> six-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 59; 0. 51; 0. 36), moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 74 and 0. 70), and high <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 -month <b>assessment</b> (0. 89). For going down stairs, ES showed that responsiveness was low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three- and six-month assessments (0. 16; 0. 25; 0. 09; 0. 08 and 0. 48; 0. 35; 0. 18, respectively), low to moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine-month <b>assessments</b> (0. 59; 0. 44), and moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 -month <b>assessment</b> (0. 71). SRM showed that responsiveness was low <b>in</b> <b>the</b> three- and six-month assessments (0. 25; 0. 35; 0. 12; 0. 09 and 0. 47; 0. 38; 0. 21, respectively), low to moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> nine-month <b>assessment</b> (0. 62; 0. 49), and moderate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> 12 -month <b>assessment</b> (0. 74). Conclusion: Climbing up stairs should be assessed at intervals of nine months or longer, when responsiveness is moderate to high. Going down stairs should be assessed annually because moderate responsiveness {{was observed in}} this period...|$|R
5|$|The {{fighting}} {{had been}} costly for both sides. Australian casualties included nine killed and 28 wounded, while one howitzer and two mortars had been damaged. North Vietnamese casualties included 52 dead, who lay strewn around the perimeter, while 23 small arms and seven crew-served weapons {{had also been}} captured by the Australians. While Radio Hanoi quickly announced a major North Vietnamese victory there was {{little doubt that the}} Australians had convincingly repulsed the attack, even if they had come close to suffering a military and political catastrophe, with the task force headquarters itself nearly being destroyed. The initial delays during the fly-in had left the defenders spread haphazardly and, had the North Vietnamese assaulted without the preparatory fire that ultimately alerted the Australians, the result may have been different. Equally, the fortunes of war had resulted in the Australian guns being laid {{in the direction of the}} main North Vietnamese assault, and the firepower they afforded had probably been decisive. The occupation of FSB Coral was one of the first such operations conducted by 1 ATF and many of the deficiencies evident had been due to this inexperience. Command and control had been insufficient and in hindsight the lack of co-ordination in setting up the defence could have been avoided with the appointment of a local defence commander. The absence of proper aerial reconnaissance prior to insertion had also resulted in units and their supporting elements landing on unsuitable ground in full view of the North Vietnamese, while the delay in the insertion of the second battalion denied them enough time to establish their positions before night fell. Failures <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>assessment</b> and timely distribution of intelligence were also identified.|$|E
