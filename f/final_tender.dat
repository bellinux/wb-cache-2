In addition to putting to sea for routine training, she also did so to serve as standby ship for the Apollo 13 recovery mission. In May, Benjamin Stoddert conducted a very successful nuclear submarine detection and tracking exercise with Epperson (DD-719), Knox (DE-1052), and Sargo (SSN-583).

The purpose of CD is to provide the public client with a flexible procedure to enable a discussion concerning {{all aspects of the}} contract with several contenders - to identify and define the means best suited to meeting its objectives - in an intervening stage between the tender announcement and the submission of <b>final</b> <b>tenders.</b> The discussions during the drafting of the CD procedure pivoted around transparent trust based collaboration, preserving fair competition and providing stimulus for innovation. This paper presents the first results of an evaluation study of 15 CD projects (partly still ongoing) in the realm of construction. The findings indicate that clients as well as contenders struggle with a number of practical issues related to the organisation of the dialogue. Furthermore, both struggle with the dynamics of risk avoidance pushing them towards detailing and high transaction costs. The research indicates that {{the competitive}} dialogue is an ambivalent procedure: both parties involved in the procedure balance between the wish to cooperate and the sensed need of keeping information to themselves because of competition. Nevertheless both see the potential of the CD procedure. Further research is needed to find out how the two principles of cooperation and competition during the CD procedure are related...|$|R

40|$|Reliable {{prediction}} of <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums of building projects from the cost plan has posed challenges for construction industry practitioners in New Zealand, especially Quantity Surveyors. No {{matter how much}} care and effort is put into the preparation of design stage elemental cost plans, significant deviations are usually observed between these cost plans and the <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sum. The major reason for this deviation is the risk inherent in both design and construction. This study is a literature-based theoretical exploration and part of an on-going doctoral research aimed at assessing the impacts of risk on the variability between design stage elemental cost plan and <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sum. This paper first provides {{a review of the}} risk elements inherent in preparing the design stage elemental cost plan by demonstrating the theoretical context. Also, it develops a methodology for assessing risk impacts on the variability between the design stage elements cost plan and <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sum.

40|$|One {{aspect of}} client {{expenditure}} management that requires attention is the accuracy in design stage elemental cost planning {{which is a}} major concern for construction clients and practitioners in New Zealand. Several researches indicated that pre-tender estimating accuracies are significantly affected by the level of risk information available to the estimators. Proper risk analysis could offer at least a partial solution by reducing the variances between design stage elemental cost plans and <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums (contract sums) of construction projects. This study investigates the accuracy in design stage elemental cost planning with a view to identifying risk factors influencing the accuracy. Project data were obtained through interviews and thematic analysis identified the risk factors. Analysis of documents obtained from the archives of study participants (consultant quantity surveyors) complemented the responses from the interviews. Findings revealed deviations of elemental cost plans from <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums in the region of - 14 % and + 13 %. These results confirmed a significant disparity between elemental cost plans and <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums. It is conjectured in this study that the identified risk factors were responsible for the deviations observed. With this information, Quantity Surveyors are able to accurately forecast <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums of building projects from the cost plans through proper risk identification and subsequent further analysis, thus increasing accuracy...|$|E
40|$|Accurate {{prediction}} of <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums (contract sums) of building projects depends on reliable projections of baseline cost plans {{developed at the}} design development stage. However, {{no matter how much}} care and effort is put into the preparation of design stage elemental cost plans, deviations are usually observed between these cost plans and the <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sum. This makes accurate predictions challenging for construction practitioners in New Zealand. The major attributable factors for the observed variability are inherent risks in the design stage elemental cost plan development. Whilst this is recognised, this study evaluates the reliability of elemental cost plans in traditional building procurement. The study seeks to answer the question: is elemental cost plan a reliable budgetary tool for construction projects? The study was undertaken based on 20 completed building projects from which secondary data were collected within the New Zealand construction industry. Data analysis was carried out using document analysis and percentage deviation of <b>final</b> <b>tender</b> sums from the cost plans. Further analyses were carried out using root mean square and relative mean absolute deviation methods of analyses. The results showed that the budgetary reliability of elemental cost plans varied depending on project types. Whilst a deviation of - 3. 67 % and + 3. 95 % was obtained on the residential projects analysed, the deviation on educational projects was between - 3. 98 % and + 12. 15 %. Commercial projects attracted - 14. 22 % and + 16. 33 % while in the case of refurbishment projects, a deviation of - 10. 07 % and + 30. 14 % was obtained. These findings suggest that the larger or more complex a project is, the less reliable it is to use elemental cost plans to guarantee cost certainty...|$|E

40|$|The {{manual process}} of {{tendering}} which is mostly {{practiced in the}} third world countries such as in Sri Lanka, is identified as a challenge an organization undergoes when procuring goods and services. It is an inevitable process which is tedious and time consuming to many managerial bodies. Tendering bodies in organizations that go through tenders manually embark on decisions using their own discretion and thus yielding improper decisions due to lack of transparency and biasness involved in the selection. In terms of this research, an investigation was carried out on a Sri Lankan state bank.

40|$|Some {{contractor}} selection methods {{currently in}} existence are criticized as incomplete and biased, and lacking consideration {{in terms of}} the contractor's ability to achieve simultaneously, time, cost, quality and safety standards. This research examines an alternative contractor selection model called the analytical hierarchy process (AHP), which will help construction clients to identify contractors with the best potential to deliver satisfactory outcomes in a final contractor selection process which is not based simply on the lowest bid. The AHP comprises three parts: hierarchic structure, prioritization procedure, and calculation of results. This model is tested by a hypothetical scenario where three contractor candidates are evaluated. The criteria used for contractor selection in the model have been identified, and the significance of each criterion has been arrived at by conducting a questionnaire survey in public organizations in Hong Kong. Comparisons are made by ranking the aggregate scores of each candidate with regard to their performance against each of the criteria, and the candidate associated with the highest scores is the best contractor on this occasion.

40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} some of the most {{significant}} and least understood aspects of the life of London publisher Henry Colburn (c. 1784 - 1855). Its purposes are to correct the misinformation currently in circulation, to introduce new information, and to reassess Colburn‘s reputation and accomplishments in light of this evidence. The thesis first examines the errors and limitations of previous appraisals of Colburn and how various primary sources can be used to correct and augment them. It next considers Colburn‘s early years before surveying his periodical publications and his controversial publicity methods. The thesis briefly recounts Colburn‘s involvement with the ‘silver-fork’ school of fiction and then examines in greater depth his relationships with writer Benjamin Disraeli and one-time business partner Richard Bentley. Colburn‘s two marriages are also studied as the focus of the thesis moves onto the latter half of his career, his retirement, and his death.

It {{is no longer}} possible to cut the deck neatly between citizenship and civic duty, on the one side, and consumption, and self interest, on the other [...] . Consumption, if not anti-citizenship, seems at best a hollow consolation for the absence of a real political autonomy (Scammell, 2000). She tenders the intriguing idea that, when transnational corporations (TNC) flouted their ability to escape state regulation, they inadvertently highlighted their own responsibility for good and bad (now called the corporate social responsibility movement). Scammell also suggests that the phenomenon of TNC social responsibility has triggered the politicization of consumption, meaning that groups concerned with environmental, social justice, rights, labour and gender issues have become political participants in the marketplace, something they did not do before! There is a fledgling movement toward seeing the consumer as a concerned citizen, being a citizen first and a consumer second- and that movement is what this conference is about!

Much education sums itself in making men economize their words, and understand them. Nor is it possible to estimate the harm which has been done, in matters of higher speculation and conduct, by loose verbiage, though we may guess at it by observing the dislike which people show to having anything about their religion said to them in simple words, because then they understand it. Thus congregations meet weekly to invoke the influence of a Spirit of Life and Truth; yet if any part of that character were intelligibly expressed to them by the formulas of the service, they would be offended. Suppose, for instance, in the closing benediction, the clergyman were to give vital significance to the vague word [...] "Holy," [...] and were to say, [...] "the fellowship of the Helpful and Honest Ghost be with you, and remain with you always," [...] what would be the horror of many, first at the irreverence of so intelligible an expression; and secondly, at the discomfortable occurrence of the suspicion that while throughout the commercial dealings of the week they had denied the propriety of Help, and possibility of Honesty, the Person whose company they had been now asking to be blessed with could have no fellowship with cruel people or knaves.|$|R
