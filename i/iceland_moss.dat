From these taxa 24 species are new to Iceland. Up to now, including our own data, on the basis of available sources 174 taxa have been reported for <b>Iceland.</b> In the <b>mosses</b> Racomitrium heterostichum and Racomitrium fasciculare an Assulina muscorum — Centropyxis globulosa-association has been recorded...|$|R

With an increase of temperature gas solubilities are reduced, and due to additionally increased microbial activities higher gas emission rates for both CO 2 and CH 4 were observed. Experimental alterations of temperature and photosynthetically active radiation (PAR) also drastically effect daytime carbon dioxide emission rates {{as a result of}} changes in microbial and plant physiology. The impact of ebullition on gas emission rates was indicated by continuous measurements of gas concentrations in the headspace of Icelandic and Swedish cores using two different experimental setups. For methane, up to View the MathML source 23 of the total emission from cores from both sites is released by ebullition. Total gas emission rate measurements in this study were similar for both experimental setups, and revealed gas effluxes comparable with field measurements for Scottish and Icelandic peat...|$|R

50|$|It {{is assumed}} that the Icelandic {{tradition}} of baking flatbread {{goes back to the}} settlement of Iceland in the 9th century. Historically, fjallagrös (<b>Iceland</b> <b>moss,</b> Cetraria islandica) was sometimes used as a supplement {{because of a lack of}} grain on the island.|$|E
50|$|It can be {{extracted}} by digesting <b>Iceland</b> <b>moss</b> in a cold, weak solution of {{carbonate of soda}} for some time, and then boiling. By this process the lichenin is dissolved and on cooling separates as a colorless jelly. Iodine imparts no color to it.|$|E
5000|$|Lichenin, {{also known}} as lichenan or moss starch, is a complex glucan {{occurring}} in certain species of lichens.

50|$|In {{the past}} <b>Iceland</b> <b>moss</b> (Cetraria islandica) was an {{important}} human food in northern Europe, and was cooked as a bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad.

50|$|The {{issue of}} a lack of grain was {{overcome}} in different ways {{in different parts of the}} country. In some areas, grain was made to go further using Dulse (Palmaria palmata; söl), <b>Iceland</b> <b>Moss</b> (Cetraria islandica; IS: fjallagrös) or Irish Moss (Chondrus crispus; fjörugrös) in compotes and breads, or by flattening the dough so thin that the bread became almost transparent. In the SE region (Skaftafellssýslur), locals knew how to use the lyme grass (Leymus arenarius) (melkorn; sometimes called the Icelandic grain) for centuries, where it was used in compotes, bread, pancakes, etc. These grain substitutes gave the bread a distinctive character. Dulse breads and biscuits can be made by mixing Dulse, rye, and Icelandic Moss in equal proportions.|$|E
5000|$|The bark {{component}} {{was usually}} from deciduous trees like elm, ash, aspen, rowan or birch, but scots pine and <b>Iceland</b> <b>moss</b> (sometimes named [...] "bread moss" [...] in Norwegian) are mentioned in historic sources. The inner bark {{is the only}} part of a tree trunk that is actually edible, the remaining bark and wood is made up of cellulose which animals, including humans, cannot digest. The dried and ground inner bark was added in proportions like 1/4th to 1/3rd [...] "bark flour" [...] to the remaining grain flour. Erik Pontoppidan, the Bishop of Bergen, Norway, in the mid 18th century, recommended using elm, as it helped the often crumbly bark bread hold together better.|$|E
50|$|The {{west coast}} has wide beaches and high dunes with Leymus grass and sea-buckthorn. Behind the dunes, there is heath with {{stretches}} of Calluna heather, <b>Iceland</b> <b>moss,</b> Cladonia, crowberry, bilberry, blueberry, cranberry and orchids including the unique Dactylorhiza majalis subsp. calcifugiens. This {{is the result}} of huge sand drifts in the 15th to 19th centuries which covered much formerly fertile land. The sand drifting affected the whole west coast of Jutland, and various other parts of Denmark as well like Tisvilde on Zealand for example. Since Thy is exposed to winds from both the north and the west, even from the North Atlantic, the sand drift went the furthest inland in this area, as far as 18 km. Parts of the sandy stretches have been turned into conifer woods. A line of lakes, believed to have been caused by the sand drifts blocking the outflow to the sea, mark the border between the western, sparsely populated sandy area and the eastern, fertile farmland.|$|E
50|$|In {{the past}} <b>Iceland</b> <b>moss</b> (Cetraria islandica) was an {{important}} human food in northern Europe and Scandinavia, and was cooked in many different ways, such as bread, porridge, pudding, soup, or salad. Wila (Bryoria fremontii) {{was an important}} food in parts of North America, where it was usually pitcooked. It is even featured in a Secwepemc story. Reindeer lichen (Cladina spp.) is a staple food of reindeer and caribou in the Arctic. Northern peoples in North America and Siberia traditionally eat the partially digested lichen after they remove it from the rumen of caribou that have been killed. It is often called 'stomach icecream'. Rock tripe (Umbilicaria spp. and Lasalia spp.) is a lichen that has frequently been used as an emergency food in North America. One species of Umbilicaria, Iwa-take (U. esculenta), is used {{in a variety of}} traditional Korean and Japanese foods. It is quite expensive, and is collected off the sides of cliffs. In India, and other centers of curry powder production, garam masala sauce contains certain lichens used as bulking agents.|$|E
50|$|Nordic food {{culture in}} the south and east of the region {{comprises}} a tradition of baking softer rye breads. In Denmark and especially in Sweden, the soft rye bread is sweeter; in Finland, a drier sour rye bread type is traditional. Iceland has for the past hundred years imported grain to make bread, as grain is not cultivated on the island. Due to the lack of grain, local ingredients such as Dulse or <b>Iceland</b> <b>Moss</b> were sometimes used to partly replace the grain. Soft sweet rye bread has also been baked for centuries in Iceland (i.e. the rye bread baked in hot springs) - the difference is that the rye has been imported from the other Nordic countries. People in the northern regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland have a tradition of baking thin flat, crispy breads using barley. Since Medieval times, bread was only baked {{once or twice a year}} and stored in dry chambers. In central Sweden and central Finland, there is a belt where a tradition of baking thin rye bread has developed. A paradox is that amongst people in the northern sub-alpine regions of Norway, Sweden and Finland and amongst the Sámi people, bread has been baked on a weekly basis and eaten as soft bread cakes. In all Nordic countries, dried fish has been used as a bread substitute, being served buttered. Today, international bread types are mixed with the old ones, and bread is used both in food innovations such as yoghurt with bread and fastfood bread and in new meal settings.|$|E

40|$|The lichen Cetraria islandica or <b>Iceland</b> <b>Moss</b> is {{commonly}} consumed as tea, food ingredients (e. g. in soup or bread) and herbal medicines. C. islandica, which has two chemotypes, {{can be difficult}} to distinguish from the sister species Cetraria ericetorum. They are collectively referred to as the Cetraria islandica species complex. This study aimed to use an UPLC-QToF-MS chemical profiling together with DNA barcoding to distinguish species and chemotypes of the C. islandica species complex. Our results show that the two chemotypes of C. islandica are clearly distinguishable from each other and from C. ericetorum by the chemometric approach. The RPB 2 barcode was able to differentiate C. islandica from C. ericetorum with a barcode gap, but the widely used nrITS barcode failed. Neither of them could discriminate chemotypes of C. islandica. In conclusion, this integrative approach involving chemical profiling and DNA barcoding could be applied for authentication of <b>Iceland</b> <b>Moss</b> materials...|$|E

Please click on the hyperlink in Additional Links fieldCetraria islandica (<b>Iceland</b> <b>moss)</b> {{has been used for}} centuries in folk medicine in many countries against a number of conditions, including inflammatory conditions, mainly as an aqueous extract. C. islandica contains many compounds, such as polysaccharides and secondary metabolites, some of which have established biological activity. However, very little is known about their effect on the immune system. Human monocyte-derived immature dendritic cells were cultured with an aqueous extract from C. islandica quantified with regard to the polysaccharides lichenan and isolichenan and secondary metabolites protolichesterinic and fumarprotocetraric acids. The purified compounds were also tested individually. Their effect on the maturation of the dendritic cells was assessed by measuring secretion of IL- 10 and IL- 12 p 40 and expression of surface molecules. In addition, the effect of the aqueous extract on antigen-induced arthritis in rats was investigated. The aqueous extract caused upregulated secretion of both IL- 10 and IL- 12 p 40, with IL- 10 secretion being more prominent. Lichenan had similar effects, whereas isolichenan and the secondary metabolites were inactive, suggesting that the effect observed by the aqueous extract was mainly mediated by lichenan. Significantly less arthritis was observed for rats treated by the aqueous extract, administered subcutaneously, compared with rats treated with saline alone. These results suggest that the aqueous extract of C. islandica has anti-inflammatory effect, possibly by changing the cytokine secretion bias from IL- 12 p 40 towards IL- 10...|$|E
