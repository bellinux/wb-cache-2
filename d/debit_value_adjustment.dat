40|$|This thesis {{studies the}} problem of {{computing}} adjustments for bilateral counterparty risk for a standard Credit Default Swap (CDS) in a three-factor first passage time default risk model. Extending the existing literature that gives analytical expression for the transition probability density function for two-dimensional Brownian motions absorbed at the boundaries in the positive quadrant, a method to obtain a semi-analytical expression for the transition probability density function of a three-dimensional Brownian motion absorbed at first exit time from the positive octant is developed. This is done by separating the problem into a radial and an angular part, of which the latter depends only on the correlation matrix. The solution to the angular part is obtained through the finite element method. These mathematical results are then used to provide semi-analytical expressions for bilateral Credit <b>Value</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (CVA) and <b>Debit</b> <b>Value</b> <b>Adjustments</b> (DVA) of a credit default swap. An example of market data is analysed in detail and it is shown that these <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> can be non-negligible. An approximation commonly used by practitioners for the computation of bilateral <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> {{is to use the}} sum of the unilateral ones as a proxy. The framework developed here allows for an analysis on the precision of this approximation to be performed {{in the case of the}} credit default swap, when wrong-way risk is present. Finally, {{the problem of}} valuing partially collateralised CDSs is studied and analytical or semi-analytical solutions are developed for computing the potential shortfall caused by the risky nature of the collateral.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of {{positive}} fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on dividend policy. If fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> are transitory in nature and managers are able to assess their implications for future earnings, fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> in net income is expected to have no distribution consequences. However, positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> may lead to higher dividends when management incorrectly assesses their persistence. This can have a procyclical impact because higher dividends increase leverage, and thus risk. We use a Russian setting that mandates fair value accounting for financial instruments and requires disclosure of unrealised fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> in income. We find no empirical support for the concern that dividends increase in response to positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b> Rather, there is a negative relationship between positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> and dividend changes, which holds after controlling for dividend policy determinants and any endogenous nature of the revaluation decision. We discuss several possible explanations for this finding...|$|R

40|$|Theoretical thesis. Bibliography: pages 62 - 67. Chapter 1. Introduction [...] Chapter 2. Theoretical {{framework}} [...] Chapter 3. Literature {{review and}} hypothesis development [...] Chapter 4. Research design [...] Chapter 5. Results [...] Chapter 6. Conclusion. This study examines {{the effect of}} fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on firms' dividend distributions under two alternate dividend law settings, i. e. profit-test-based dividend law and net-assets-test based dividend law. This is important because both firms' dividend policy and fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> have an association with reported earnings. The study {{contributes to the literature}} by combining two variables, namely dividend law and fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments,</b> to examine firms' dividend policy. Specifically, this thesis hypothesises that, (1) positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> have no distribution consequences under profit-test-based dividend law; and (2) that such adjustments are distributed under net-assets-test-based dividend law. The study uses Fama and Babiak's (1968) variation of Lintner's (1956) model and a sample of 185 ASX-listed financial sector firms with 1, 496 firm-year observations to test the two hypotheses. The sample period of nine financial years from 2005 − 06 to 2013 − 14 enables an analysis in both dividend law settings because Australia changed from profit-test-based dividend law to net-assets-test-based dividend law in July 2010. Under the profit-test-based dividend law, contrary to the expectations, the results show that positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> are distributed. Managers' inability to differentiate between persistent and transitory fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> amid non-consideration of transitory nature of fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments,</b> while setting dividend policy, provide some explanation of the results. Under the net-assets-test-based dividend law, the study expects, but did not find any effect of positive fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on firms' dividend payouts. Firms' preference to pursue conservative dividend policy and to attach dividend payouts with permanent earnings, provide some explanation of the findings. The results show that the statutory detachment of earnings and dividends under net-assets-test-based dividend law has not affected the conventional link between these two variables.

40|$|We {{examine the}} impact of upward fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> on {{dividend}} policies in Russia, where corporate governance is weak. We discuss the case of the utility company Unified Energy System (UES), which abolished its dividends (including mandatory preferred dividends) after reporting a record profit resulting from fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b> In a large sample of Russian firms, we find a negative relationship between upward fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> and dividend changes. We suggest that fair <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> may introduce noise and inhibit decision making because users may have difficulties in assessing the distribution relevance of the income components. In low investor protection countries, where outsiders generally lack the power to press corporate insiders to distribute cash, this may be seized upon by corporate insiders to adjust dividends downwards.

40|$|In the Basel III accords in 2013, it {{was stated}} that {{financial}} institutions should charge Credit <b>Value</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (CVA) to their counterparties for (previously under-regulated) Over-The-Counter (OTC) trades. This CVA {{can be used}} to hedge a possible default of the counterparty. One important ingredient of CVA is the calculation of the future exposure of the portfolio on which CVA has been charged. This future exposure is also used to determine more recent <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> like Debt <b>Value</b> <b>Adjustment</b> (DVA) and Capital <b>Value</b> <b>Adjustments</b> (KVA), and can be calculated from a future distribution of the portfolio value. This distribution {{can also be used to}} compute quantiles which are so-called “worst case” scenarios, and are therefore relevant for risk management. Computing the distribution of future portfolio values requires simulating the future states of the risk factors, and then evaluating the portfolio in all these future states. As the number of risk drivers in a typically traded portfolio is high, computing exposure for portfolios is a numerical challenge. In this thesis we look into multiple numerical techniques for the computation of exposures of realistic derivative portfolios. One of the key contributions of this thesis is the Finite Difference Monte Carlo (FDMC) method for an efficient computation of future exposure...|$|R

(2015, § 8) for details on the calibration of affine LIBOR models. An interpolating function is subsequently chosen and the dynamics of the short rate process are derived. Afterwards, the computation of the <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> is a straightforward application of the VA BSDE in (37).|$|R

Uncollateralized trades should then be considered not as derivatives but as new primary assets in the investor's economy. Different choices of the risk-neutral measure correspond to different completions of the market, based on the risk appetite of the investor, leading to different levels of <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b> We recover, in limiting cases, results well known in the literature.

30|$|Figure  6 {{depicts the}} sample {{path of the}} VA process using the first interpolating {{function}} (left panels) for the five different CSA specifications (top to bottom), while the other figures show {{the differences in the}} VA due to the different interpolating functions. The differences in the VA are one order of magnitude smaller than the differences in prices, however, the VA itself is an order of magnitude smaller than the basis swap price. Reflecting the situation for the prices, the largest discrepancies between VAs using the first and the other two interpolating functions occur around the curved section of the manifold. However, the discrepancies in the VA in the flat sections of the manifold are more pronounced than the corresponding discrepancies in prices. The reason is that the interpolation affects <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> both via the basis swap price and via the short rate used for discounting, and its effect is propagated in different segments through the backward regression. This becomes clear when one looks at the differences between prices and <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> stemming from using the second and third interpolating functions; although the difference in prices is flat zero, the difference in <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> is far from zero.|$|R

30|$|This {{methodology}} {{allows us}} to compute option prices and <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> consistently since we only have to calibrate the discrete-tenor affine LIBOR model, while {{the dynamics of the}} short rate process, which is essential in the computation of the VA, follows from the interpolation. In particular, we do not need to introduce and calibrate (or estimate) an “exogenous” model for the short rate, as is done in other approaches. The interpolating function thus plays a crucial role in our methodology, since this is the only “free‘” ingredient once the affine LIBOR model has been calibrated. At the same time, it introduces an element of model risk, through the different possible choices of interpolating functions. In the sequel, we are going to examine the impact of different interpolating functions on the <b>value</b> <b>adjustments.</b>|$|R

30|$|We {{consider}} {{the class of}} affine LIBOR models with multiple curves, which is an analytically tractable class of discrete tenor models that easily accommodates positive or negative interest rates and positive spreads. By introducing an interpolating function, we extend the affine LIBOR models to a continuous tenor and derive expressions for the instantaneous forward rate and the short rate. We show that the continuous tenor model is arbitrage-free, that the analytical tractability is retained under the spot martingale measure, and that under mild conditions an interpolating function can be found such that the extended model fits any initial forward curve. This allows us to compute <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> (i.e. XVAs) consistently, by solving the corresponding ‘pre-default’ BSDE. As an application, we compute the price and <b>value</b> <b>adjustments</b> for a basis swap, and study the model risk associated to different interpolating functions.|$|R
