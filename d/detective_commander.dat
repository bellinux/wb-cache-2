25|$|Seedman {{established}} himself as a detective during the 1960s. As the <b>detective</b> <b>commander</b> for Brooklyn, he once oversaw an investigation of a shooting death, in which over 2,000 people were interviewed, that turned out to have been a freak accident. He investigated many prominent crimes during that era, including the Borough Park Tobacco robbery and the Kitty Genovese murder. As the chief of detective he reformed that branch by assigning detectives to specialize in certain areas of crime rather than just investigating whatever cases came their way when they were on shift. His tenure as chief of detectives of the city was short but memorable, marked by the Knapp Commission's corruption investigations which briefly cost him his job, several mob hits and terror attacks carried out by the Black Liberation Army (BLA). When his superior officers hindered his investigation into the murder of an officer at a Harlem mosque out of fear of a race riot, Seedman resigned his position and retired from the force, although he did not say that had been the reason for another 40 years.|$|E

5000|$|The fourth film, Live Free or Die Hard (titled Die Hard 4.0 in {{releases}} outside North America), {{which takes}} place on Independence Day, takes place 13 years later. McClane is assigned to take hacker Matt Farrell (Justin Long) into FBI custody.

Although McClane's NYPD file, accessed by Thomas Gabriel, notes he has been a Lieutenant since 1987, it also states he currently holds the rank of Detective. Terrorists led by Thomas Gabriel (Timothy Olyphant), are conducting a fire sale to bidders, taking out the nation's infrastructure: power plants, traffic lights, transportation, and financial markets.|$|R
25|$|During 2007, a {{television}} pilot for an American version of Life on Mars was filmed by 20th Century Fox Television's, David E. Kelley. Actor Colm Meaney was cast as Hunt, the precinct Captain of a Los Angeles Police Department squad. Meaney {{had not seen}} the British series but bought the DVD sets at an airport after filming had been completed. The 2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike delayed the start of the series until 2008. By then, the ABC network wanted the pilot to be reshot without Kelley's involvement. Meaney was not hired to play Hunt again; instead, Harvey Keitel assumed the role. The setting of the series was moved to New York City, and Hunt was changed to a police lieutenant, the typical rank of a NYPD <b>detective</b> squad's <b>commander.</b>|$|R
50|$|This was the era {{in which}} the squad's close ties with the {{criminal}} fraternity, which {{had always been a}} necessary part of its strategy, were being exposed to public criticism. A number of scandals involving bribery and corruption were revealed, and on 7 July 1977, the squad's <b>commander,</b> <b>Detective</b> Chief Superintendent Kenneth Drury, was convicted on five counts of corruption and imprisoned for eight years. Twelve other officers were also convicted and many more resigned. These and other scandals led to a massive internal investigation by the Dorset Constabulary into the Metropolitan Police Service and the City of London Police, codenamed Operation Countryman.|$|R
5000|$|Eventually Licalsi was {{investigated}} and Kelly {{allowed her to}} destroy evidence that would have pointed to her involvement in the murder. After Licalsi confessed to killing Marino (and his bodyguard) she was tried and sentenced {{to two years in}} jail for manslaughter. It became evident to Kelly that he had no future in the job as Internal affairs came after him for his role in trying to help Licalsi and his testimony on her behalf. IAB couldn't find any hard evidence to end his career with, but Captain Haverill, an opponent of the 15th's <b>detective</b> squad <b>commander,</b> Lieutenant Arthur Fancy, had provoked Kelly into an act of insubordination and had demoted him to radio dispatch work until IAB could [...] "find" [...] the means to end his career. Kelly refused to accept this and resigned from the force. He was last heard to be acting as a bodyguard and security expert, and was not able to attend Andy Sipowicz's wedding because he was working in India. Lieutenant Fancy was not pleased to see Kelly's career end via Captain Haverill and would later force Haverill's retirement with an incriminating tape recording.|$|R

5000|$|Administrative {{positions}} do {{not exactly}} tally with ranks among Inspector level and junior officers, admin positions (from PC to Station Commander or even Deputy Chief of a sub-Bureau), are various and flexible, {{it depends on}} each individual's qualifications and multiple skills, performance efficiency and effectiveness, years of service, personality and communication ability, potential leadership. Loyal and qualified officers with no misconduct record, are eligible to get rank promotion at every four-year of service (only applicable from Sgt 1st class to Insp 1st class). Which means for example, for a normal PC holding a non-commissioned position during his/her entire police career, with the increasing years of service, the highest rank he/she may attain is either Insp 3rd class (for high school and below qualification holders), or Insp 1st class (for university graduated certificate holders). Alternatively, young officers who are holding university degree(regardless of disciplines and majors), usually {{after three years of}} service, once his/her overall performance and ability meet operation needs, recommended by his/her team leader or a higher ccommanding officer, may have chance to get promoted (as sub-unit <b>commander,</b> <b>detective</b> supervisor....|$|R
40|$|This report summarises what {{is known}} about the extent and nature of armed robbery nationally, {{highlighting}} the very welcome reductions in the number of these crimes in 1994 and 1995. It goes on to examine the policing strategies in two very different forces - the Metropolitan Police and South Yorkshire Police - showing how the police response can be tailored to the particular environment and local circumstances. The value of proactive police work and the use of informants is clearly demonstrated in the Metropolitan Police, while the speed and quality of response to incidents was important in South Yorkshire.

40|$|Globalization {{presents}} an important opportunity for police and justice officials {{around the world}} to cooperate with one another to bring offenders of serious transnational organized crime to justice. Numerous trends and developments are emerging in Europe—especially in the cross-border Meuse–Rhine Euregion, where the three countries of Belgium, The Netherlands, and Germany meet. Indeed, the police and justice officials of the Meuse–Rhine Euregion are acknowledged as the “pioneers” of routine cross-border police and judicial cooperation, and due to various factors, their work is arguably among the most long-standing, advanced, and intense in the world. Despite an expanding legal framework, however, operational problems still arise in practice. Therefore, one question becomes: how may international police and judicial cooperation in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The Meuse–Rhine Euregion frames this multi-site case study, which uses the Organizational Behavior (OB) approach to examine the state-of-the-art. Specifically, the analysis of scholarly literature, international law, and in-depth personal interviews with 44 English-speaking police <b>detectives,</b> senior police <b>commanders,</b> prosecutors, and examining magistrates from 21 organizations across the three countries in this Euregion provides the data to answer this study’s four main research questions, namely: (1) What is the status quo with respect to international police and judicial cooperation aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; (2) How does the process of international police and judicial cooperation aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion operate in practice, according to police and justice officials?; (3) What variables affect (facilitate/impede) international police and judicial cooperation aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, according to police and justice officials?; and (4) How can international police and judicial cooperation aimed at combating serious transnational organized crime in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion be improved? The findings of this study may help improve international police and judicial cooperation in the Meuse–Rhine Euregion, and inspire similar cooperative efforts around the world...|$|R
