5|$|Bhikshatana {{is often}} {{accompanied}} by women and bhuta-gana (goblin attendants of Shiva). One of the attendants placed {{to the left of}} Bhikshatana should carry a large bowl used for storing the food alms of Shiva. The women, often seven in number, are variously pictured as enamoured of Shiva, eager to <b>embrace</b> <b>him,</b> blessing him, or serving him food in his begging bowl with a ladle. The clothes of some of these women are slipping from their loins, symbolising their lust. The woman giving Bhikshatana alms is also interpreted as Annapurna, the goddess of grain. Various gods, celestial beings, and sages bow to him with folded hands. In some scenes, the sages are depicted as angry and trying to beat Bhikshatana, alluding to the Deodar Forest legend.|$|E

25|$|Romanian historiography adopted Hunyadi {{and gives}} him a place of {{importance}} {{in the history of}} Romania too. Although, Romanian national consciousness did not <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> to the extent that Hungarian national conscience did. John Hunyadi, a Hungarian hero, was subordinated to the ideology of National Communism in the era of Ceaușescu and transmuted into a hero of Romania.|$|E
25|$|In {{the waiting}} room, Prince Faisal talked to Kuwaiti representatives {{who were also}} waiting to meet King Faisal. When the Prince went to <b>embrace</b> <b>him,</b> King Faisal leaned to kiss his nephew in {{accordance}} with Saudi custom. At that instant, Prince Faisal took out a pistol and shot him. The first shot hit King Faisal's chin and the second one went through his ear. A bodyguard hit Prince Faisal with a sheathed sword. Oil minister Zaki Yamani yelled repeatedly not to kill the Prince.|$|E
25|$|Livingstone {{was known}} {{through a large}} part of Africa for {{treating}} the natives with respect, and the tribes that he visited returned his respect with faith and loyalty. He could never permanently convert the tribesmen to Christianity, however. Among other reasons, Sechele, by then the leader of the African tribe, did not like the way that Livingstone could not demand rain of his God like his rainmakers, who said that they could. After long hesitation from Livingstone, he baptised Sechele and had the church completely <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b> Sechele was now a part of the church, but he continued to act according to his African culture, which went against Livingstone's teachings.|$|E

25|$|In his twenty-fourth year, Muthukutty {{was struck}} by illness and {{suffered}} for a year. His mother took her sick son to the temple at Thiruchendur, during a festival there. He went into the sea and disappeared. The parents searched for his body for one day. According to legend, on the third day, Lord Vishnu appeared on the sea-shore. On seeing him, Muthukutty's mother mistook him for her son and tried to <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b> He {{told her that he}} was no longer her son, but the son of Supreme Lord Narayana. Then he started walking towards Detchanam. This place became a holy place for the devotees of Ayyavazhi and they erected a temple there named Avatharappathi. This event is celebrated during the festival of Ayya Vaikundar Avataram.|$|E
500|$|During her audition, Kathy sings as Scottish amateur singer Susan Boyle {{who gained}} {{worldwide}} attention for her {{performance of the}} song [...] "I Dreamed a Dream" [...] from the musical Les Misérables on the reality show Britain's Got Talent. Kathy's performance (sung by operatic soprano Lisette Oropesa) gets Liz and Jack teared up, similar to Boyle's performance on Britain's Got Talent. It is revealed that Dot Com once portrayed the character Boris Alexeyevich Trigorin in Anton Chekhov's play The Seagull. When Kenneth refuses to <b>embrace</b> <b>him,</b> Jack asks him [...] "Et tu, Kenneth?", prompting Kenneth to explain in Latin why he will not embrace Jack due to his bedbugs.|$|E
500|$|A {{few members}} of Cho's family, those who {{remained}} in South Korea, had concerns about his behavior during his early childhood. Cho's relatives {{thought that he was}} selectively mute or mentally ill. According to Cho's uncle, Cho [...] "didn't say much and did not mix with other children." [...] Cho's maternal great-aunt described Cho as [...] "cold" [...] and a cause of family concern from as young as eight years old. According to his great-aunt, who met him twice, Cho was extremely shy and [...] "just would not talk at all." [...] He was otherwise considered [...] "well-behaved," [...] readily obeying verbal commands and cues. The great-aunt said she knew something was wrong after the family's departure for the United States because she heard frequent updates about Cho's older sister but little news about Cho. During an ABC News Nightline interview on August 30, 2007, Cho's grandfather reported his concerns about Cho's behavior during childhood. According to Cho's grandfather, Cho never looked up to him to make eye contact, never called him grandfather, and never moved to <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

500|$|Davis {{appreciated}} Hammond's {{closeness to}} the SG-1 team and {{his willingness to}} compromise. At {{the beginning of the}} series, Hammond does not accept the alien warrior Teal'c but comes to trust and respect him after realizing Teal'c's devotion to the Stargate Program. Despite his admiration for Dr. Daniel Jackson's enthusiasm in the beginning, Hammond has a hard time understanding Daniel's unorthodox and non-military approach to problems until Hammond comes to realize the importance of a civilian viewpoint to SG-1's mission. When the alien Jonas Quinn joins SG-1 in season 6, Davis compared Hammond's response to Jonas to his reaction to Teal'c in season 1. Although Hammond does not blame Jonas for Daniel's death in [...] "Meridian", [...] "the situation does make it difficult for [...] to totally take the young man under his wing and <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> like family as he has the rest of SG-1". Davis named the NID as Hammond's only source of frustration, since they regularly outflank Hammond and SG-1. Hammond's only option is to call the President for support, but most cases end with SG-1 or Hammond breaking the rules to assure the survival of humanity, so [...] "Hammond will do whatever he must to get things done".|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b> He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because I heard he is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
500|$|Monteux's later London {{performances}} {{were not only}} with the LSO. In 1960 he conducted Beecham's Royal Philharmonic Orchestra performing [...] "feats of wizardry" [...] in works by Beethoven, Debussy and Hindemith. The LSO offered him the post of principal conductor in 1961, when he was eighty-six; he accepted, on condition that he had a contract for twenty-five years, with an option of renewal. His large and varied repertoire was displayed in his LSO concerts. In addition to the French repertoire with which, to his occasional irritation, he was generally associated, he programmed Mozart, Beethoven, Brahms and Wagner, as well as later composers including Granados, Schoenberg, Scriabin, Shostakovich, Sibelius, Richard Strauss and Vaughan Williams. With the LSO, Monteux gave a fiftieth anniversary performance of The Rite of Spring at the Royal Albert Hall {{in the presence of the}} composer. Although the recording of the occasion reveals some lapses of ensemble and slack rhythms, it was an intense and emotional concert, and Monteux climbed up to Stravinsky's box to <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> at the end. Players believed that in his few years in charge he transformed the LSO; Neville Marriner felt that he [...] "made them feel like an international orchestra... He gave them extended horizons and some of his achievements with the orchestra, both at home and abroad, gave them quite a different constitution." ...|$|E

2500|$|After {{recording}} the final out, Orosco threw his glove {{high in the}} air and immediately dropped to his knees while catcher Gary Carter ran out to the mound to <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> {{with the rest of the}} team following. A famous photo of the celebration was taken by Mets photographer George Kalinsky. For many years, this was the final scene shown during the ending credits of the syndicated Major League Baseball news show This Week in Baseball, and was replaced in 1992 by the final out of the division-clinching victory by the Atlanta Braves in 1991. [...] And then, the song: [...] "Success" [...] by The Weather Girls was played.|$|E
2500|$|Writing for AllMusic, critic Bruce Eder {{assessed}} Cohen's overall {{career in}} popular music by asserting that [...] " [...] {{one of the}} most fascinating and enigmatic... singer-songwriters of the late '60s... Second only to Bob Dylan (and perhaps Paul Simon), he commands the attention of critics and younger musicians more firmly than any other musical figure from the 1960s who continued to work in the 21st century." [...] The Academy of American Poets commented more broadly, stating that [...] "Cohen's successful blending of poetry, fiction, and music is made most clear in Stranger Music: Selected Poems and Songs, published in 1993... while it may seem to some that Leonard Cohen departed from the literary in pursuit of the musical, his fans continue to <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> as a Renaissance man who straddles the elusive artistic borderlines." ...|$|E
2500|$|Henry Morton Stanley {{had been}} sent to find him by the New York Herald {{newspaper}} in 1869. He found Livingstone in the town of Ujiji on the shores of Lake Tanganyika on 10 November 1871, greeting him with the now famous words [...] "Dr. Livingstone, I presume?" [...] Livingstone responded, [...] "Yes", and then [...] "I feel thankful that I am here to welcome you." [...] These famous words may have been a fabrication, as Stanley later tore out the pages of this encounter in his diary. Even Livingstone's account of this encounter does not mention these words. However, the phrase appears in a New York Herald editorial dated 10 August 1872, and the Encyclopædia Britannica and the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography both quote it without questioning its veracity. The words are famous because of their perceived humor, Livingstone being the only other white person for hundreds of miles. Stanley's book suggests that it was really because of embarrassment, because he did not dare to <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E

2500|$|The couplet {{brings the}} sonnet {{together}} in a happy light. Throughout the sonnet we're learning about the poet's dark confessions to finding his ideal love and realizing the only love that he needs the most is of the young mans. Jane Roessner notices how the line [...] "then give me welcome, next my heaven the best" [...] is [...] "the poet's need of pity from the young man and how his long confession important for {{its effect on the}} young man, calculated to move him to a certain response." [...] Line 13 is the poet begging the young man to forgive him and to <b>embrace</b> <b>him.</b> The phrase in line 13 [...] "next my heaven the best" [...] is the poet confessing to the young man that his love is like his heaven. He is the closest thing to the divine. Radley and Redding state that the poet is saying, [...] "your love is next of the divine (ideal), grant me a welcome sanctuary in your person." [...] The couplet is the most powerful part of the sonnet because now he is saying that the love the young man provides is great next to this divine being.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{beginning}} of the video, Gabe gets his picture taken in the photobooth, and when he's grabbing it, a picture of Sabi appears to be stuck in the slit. Both picture's feelings read [...] "Incomplete". Then Gabe makes his goal of the night to find the girl in the picture. While this is happening, Victoria Asher is seen dragging different people into the bathroom, these people including twins and a girl, hence her feeling being [...] "kinky". Gabe goes around the club (his [...] "world" [...] girl I've been all over the world looking for you) trying to find Sabi and stumbling upon different people who <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> in hugs or handshakes. Sabi is seen dancing around the club when her part of the song comes on. Nate Novarro instead of dancing, orders a burger through Vicky-T's iPad; his feeling being [...] "munchy". During the first two thirds of the video, all drinks seem to be taken away from Ryland Blackinton, hence why on his picture he's feeling [...] "thirsty". When Gabe finally finds Sabi, they give each other a look of sheer happiness, before they both enter the photobooth. The lights go off, and at the moment they go back on, Gabe and Sabi seem to be kissing. They take a new picture together, and it reads [...] "Complete", thus ending the video.|$|E
2500|$|The ACNA has {{established}} friendly ecumenical {{relationships with the}} Roman Catholic Church. The RCC was represented by Bishop Kevin Vann at their inaugural Provincial Assembly, in Bedford, Texas, on 22 June 2009. In October 2009, ACNA's leadership reacted to the Roman Catholic Church's proposed creation of personal ordinariates for disaffected traditionalist Anglicans by stating that although they believe that this provision will not be utilized by {{the great majority of}} its laity and clergy, they will happily bless those who are drawn to participate in this proposal. The ACNA expressed his support for the RCC in her opposition to the HHS mandate, with Archbishop Robert Duncan being one of the signatories of the statement of the Christian Associates of Southwest Pennsylvania, representing 26 Christian denominations, on 13 April 2012. Archbishop Duncan and Bishop Ray Sutton were also invited to the weekly private audience by Pope Benedict XVI, which took place in Rome, on 28 November 2012, whom they meet and greet afterwards on behalf of the ACNA and the Fellowship of Confessing Anglicans. The ACNA Provincial Assembly, which reunited more than 900 participants, and their College of Bishops conclave, which elected Foley Beach as the second Archbishop of the province, took place at the Roman Catholic Benedictine St. Vincent Archabbey Basilica, in Latrobe, Pennsylvania, from 19–21 June 2014, due to the kind permission of Archabbot Douglas Robert Nowicki, a personal friend of Archbishop Duncan. Archbishop Wilton Daniel Gregory of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Atlanta offered Foley Beach an African-made crozier, which he used at his investiture ceremony, that took place at the Church of the Apostles, in Atlanta, Georgia, at 9 October 2014. Former Archbishop Gregory Venables of the Anglican Church of the Southern Cone of America read at the ceremony a message by his personal friend Pope Francis, who sent Archbishop Foley Beach his [...] "personal greetings and congratulations as he leads his church in the very important job of revival" [...] and asked Archbishop Venables to <b>embrace</b> <b>him</b> on his behalf.|$|E
