40|$|Transportation absorbs about 70 % of oil {{consumption}} in EU countries. The fuels that burn {{in the field}} of transport are composed of 96 % of oil. Energy efficiency of road and air traffic must also be improved. But transport environmental impacts reductions should be made necessarily through a transfer of traffic from the car, lorries and aircraft to train, ship, and non motorized two-wheelers into the EU cities. In fact the former are large producers of greenhouse gases, while the latter are more environmentally friendly means of transport in climate. Reaching an annual increase of 1 % of the modal split in favour of more sustainable means of transport on the environment must be set as a goal ecologic. Legal, infrastructure and tariff measures have to be proposed, in addition to technical measures (reduction of traffic, growth in the energy efficiency of vehicles, reduction of ravelled distances, improved logistics, etc.). Legal measures refer to possible law limits in terms on fuel consumption and CO 2 emissions due to traffic set by the EU.

40|$|This paper {{takes a look}} {{at various}} {{tradeoffs}} that are at stake in the goal for reduced ship emissions and may impact the cost-effectiveness of the maritime logistics chain and presents some models {{that can be used to}} evaluate these tradeoffs. The reason for investigating such tradeoffs is that measures to reduce such emissions may possibly have ramifications as regards the logistical supply chain, and vice-versa. The broad spectrum of measures that are involved in the drive to reduce emissions generally depends on the type of emissions that are studied. In this paper we focus on operational measures that have a direct link to logistical operations, and investigate related tradeoffs. The focus is mainly on CO 2 and SO 2 emissions. Measures such as reduction of speed, change of number of ships in the fleet, and possibly others, will generally entail changes (positive or negative) in overall emissions, but also in other logistics and cost-effectiveness attributes such as in-transit inventory and other costs. Industry circles have also voiced the concern that low-sulphur fuel in SECAs (these are the so-called ‘sulphur emissions control areas ’ that exist in some parts of the world- for instance the Baltic and the North Sea) may make maritime transport (and in particular short-sea shipping) more expensive and induce shippers to use land-based alternatives (mainly road), even though shifting cargo from land to sea is an important policy goal. A reverse shift of cargo from sea to land might ultimately increase the overall level of CO 2 emissions along the <b>intermodal</b> <b>chain.</b> Models to investigate such problems are developed and some examples are presented...|$|E
40|$|Key {{performance}} indicator-driven connection {{management at}} airports with public transportation services Integrated traffic management across {{a range of}} shareholders within a widespread network requires a definition of KPIs to assess intermodal performance. Their purpose is to monitor and analyze the technical performance of individual modules of a transportation network, e. g. an airport. Actions recommended to optimize operations and to maintain operation during disruptions are ideally based on an understanding of the system-wide impact of the action and for the entire <b>intermodal</b> <b>chain</b> of the journey from door to door. With all the numerous possible parameters and indicators which can be monitored within a complex transportation network, not every indicator is necessarily a key indicator. We show which indicators can depict a situation consisting of a system status and a system forecast, which allow interstakeholder optimization and which serve as an enabler for a Mobility as a Service (MaaS) concept. Examples of intermodal-oriented KPIs include the Amount of useable travel time, the Boarding Score and the Connectivity Matrix. Useable travel times are defined as the longest, continuous travel and waiting times which can be used for productivity or relaxation. The Boarding Score accounts for reaching a connection on time, e. g. catching the desired flight after travelling to the airport by train. The Connectivity Matrix dynamically expands the Minimum Connecting Time MCT (which is known from airports and is important for booking systems), allowing forecast values to be offered based on the demanded connecting journeys instead of on average spreadsheet values. With the deployment of the new key performance indicator set a tool is given to visualize situational awareness at an airport. This includes nowcasting as well as forecasting awareness which is required to assess different options of intervention. The method of calculation of the KPI set is enriched by a concept of visualization using virtual reality options to maintain usability within distributed management teams.

Increasingly congested motorways, rising oil prices and concerns about environment and climate change require the optimization of transport systems and transport processes. The best solution should be the intermodal transport, in which the most efficient transport options are used for the different legs of transport. This thesis examines the problem of defining innovative strategies and procedures for the sustainable development of intermodal freight transport in Europe. In particular, the role of maritime transport and railway transport in the <b>intermodal</b> <b>chain</b> are examined in depth, as these modes are recognized to be environmentally friendly and energy efficient. Maritime transport is the only mode that has kept pace with the fast growth in road transport, but it is necessary to promote the full exploitation of it by involving short sea shipping as an integrated service in the intermodal door-to-door supply chain and by improving port accessibility. The role of Motorways of the Sea services as part of the Trans-European Transport Network is is taken into account: a picture of the European policy and a state of the art of the Italian Motorways of the Sea system are reported. Afterwards, the focus shifts from line to node problems: the role of intermodal railway terminals in the transport chain is discussed. In particular, the last mile process is taken into account, as it is crucial in order to exploit the full capacity of an intermodal terminal. The difference between the present last mile planning models of Bologna Interporto and Verona Quadrante Europa is described and discussed. Finally, a new approach to railway intermodal terminal planning and management is introduced, by describing the case of "Terminal Gate" at Verona Quadrante Europa. Some proposals to favour the integrate management of "Terminal Gate" and the allocation of its capacity are drawn up. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{design and}} {{management}} of global supply chains are nowadays {{one of the most}} active research topics in global logistics and intermodal logistic has developed into a significant sector of the transport logistics in its own right while very little is known about costs in the <b>intermodal</b> <b>chain</b> or appropriate calculation methods. In realistic, the transport volume increase gloriously in the past 30 years in EU and the cost of transporation covers the majority part of the entire supply chain. So it is necessary for us to build a model to aid in the calculation of transportation cost and mode selection between different transportation choices. As the concept of supply chain management {{is becoming more and more}} important in addressing an organization's environmental impacts, increasingly environmental and social aspects are being incorporated into supply chain management. Customers are not only influenced by the costs, speeds and reliabilities of supply chain, but also by the perceived environmental impact of each activity. Considering all of these, the integration of transportation models and environmental impacts has become an interesting and crucial domian for exporation. Most of the models of the integration of production and transportation are presented for reducing the transportation costs and choosing the route more economic in the assurence of delivery time. In the paper "Creating a Green Supply Chain"(Khoo et al., Greener Management International, vol. 35, pp. 71 - 88, 2002), the author propose a model of green supply chain by integrating the concerns of transport pollution, maketing costs, time to market, recycling of scrap metal and energy conservation. Besides, there is little work until nowadays taking all kinds of transportation into account In our study, we build a model integrating the conflicting factors such as cost, on-time service and risk and the environmental impacts within the framework of intermodal logistics to aid the decision of the most effective transportation mode choice or mix between freight, rail, boat and airways. This model is attributed to integrat a set of constraits of each transport company. So a supplier would be able to calculate with the model we offered and make his decision of the most effective transportation mode choice or mix according to his own object: minimisation of the transporation cost, the transport duration or the environmental impacts. Simulation and modelling tools are introduced to aid in the decision making process of distance selections and choices of transporation...|$|E

An increased use of short sea shipping can balance the European transport system and contribute to a better environmental situation. Accordingly, The European Commission proposes a shift of transported volumes from road to rail and short sea shipping. One alternative that has been discussed is a greater focus on intermodal solutions. <b>Intermodal</b> transport <b>chains</b> involve several modes and a multitude of actors. The transport industry is fragmented and each transport mode has developed its own terminology and performance models. This is a difficulty when trying to analyze and improve the performance of <b>intermodal</b> transport <b>chains.</b> A development of a joint performance model is therefore necessary. The focus of this work has been method development. Although logistics is a discipline with an explicit systems approach, the methodology and tools from systems engineering has not been commonly adopted. This research has therefore applied systems engineering methods to logistics in order to clarify the requirement structure forming the base {{for the design of}} ships aimed for short sea shipping service. Knowledge about each segment of the chain is vital for meeting customers requirements and internal goals of productivity.
