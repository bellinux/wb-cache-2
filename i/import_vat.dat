5000|$|The Freak Emporium ceased {{trading in}} late November 2007, citing {{the problem of}} VAT free imports from the Channel Islands as the {{principal}} reason. Although no longer trading, the site remains online today as an archive and information resource for collectable and underground music. After giving evidence to the All Parliamentary Shops Committee in 2005, Allen became a pioneering tax campaigner in the era prior {{to the formation of}} UK Uncut and campaigned against retailers that were using an EU <b>import</b> <b>VAT</b> relief to obtain what he argued was a damaging and unfair advantage. He claimed that The Channel Island VAT free import fulfilment industry was devastating UK music retail and other UK retail sectors. [...] In 2010, along with a number of retailers from various industries, Allen formed Retailers Against VAT Avoidance Schemes (RAVAS) and created the website www.vatloophole.co.uk [...] RAVAS successfully campaigned for the ending of the Channel Islands LVCR industry and after a landmark court hearing which took place on 13 - 15 March 2012 in London [...] LVCR was no longer applicable to Channel Island mail order goods destined for the UK. The Judgement is now regarded as an important precedent clarifying the application of discretionary powers by EU member states.|$|E
40|$|In {{the context}} of Value Added Tax (VAT) on consumption, the {{importance}} of VAT deduction is increasing particularly by cross-border trade with goods and services. That is to say, the mechanism of deduction may prevent the foreign trade from VAT caused trade barriers. In this work, the conventional concept of trade barriers is initially clarified as governmental discrimination of economic sales from abroad. For VAT purposes, this concept takes a supplementation. The discrimination in terms of VAT can be proven {{on the basis of}} the so-called destination principle. According to this principle, it is solely admitted taxes to be imposed in that country in which supplied goods or services are consumed. Therefore, this principle is also called country of consumption principle. If goods or service have arrived at the country of destination and are burdened by the country of origin with VAT, this country should provide for deduction or refund of the levied VAT. Thus, the concept of trade barriers is to be supplemented by discrimination of economic sales to foreign countries. Hence, the country of origin has to award the unlimited right to deduct input VAT and the performance of this right in order to prevent trade barriers. Additionally, it is generally not allowed to levy higher taxes on the “imported” sale in the country of destination for the reason that the sale is originated from abroad. Subsequently, it is discovered certain restrictions of the VAT deduction concerning cross-border transactions of goods and services between EU member states and Turkey from the viewpoint of VAT law in the EU. Residents in Turkey as supplier or receiver of taxable sales can claim VAT deduction only in accordance to Directive 86 / 560 /EEC. This Directive concedes essential (political) scope for limitations of VAT deduction (refund), e. g. “of reciprocity” or the appointment of a tax representative, to the member states. Furthermore, the VAT refund is unavoidable excluded by the Directive, if the taxable person from Turkey supplies particular sales of insurances and financial products or incur some expenditures determined by the respective EU member state. Pursuant to Turkish VAT law, it can be stated that there are shortcomings of VAT deduction detrimental to EU residents with regard to the cross-border trade. If EU taxable persons receive goods or services from Turkey, which are subject to VAT, a VAT deduction, on a regular basis, is not permitted. Moreover, taxable persons from EU, who imports goods to Turkey, are basically obliged to pay <b>import</b> <b>VAT.</b> The deduction of this tax requires that the taxable person owes VAT due to other taxable sales in Turkey. The <b>import</b> <b>VAT</b> could be deducted from this VAT debt. But it is rarely the case that there is that kind of VAT debt. Finally, EU taxable persons supplying taxable cross-border sales in Turkey are not eligible to VAT deduction, to the extent that the input VAT on purchases exceeds the VAT debt on the cross-border sales...|$|E
40|$|Given the {{inadequacy}} of the revenue base {{to cope with the}} targeted level of economic activities due to the ever-increasing demands of the populace, governments of developing countries (including Ghana) often engage in deficit financing. There is now a consensus among interested parties on the need to address the problem effectively. An appraisal of the budgetary process in Ghana shows that annual expenditure proposals are always anchored on projected revenue, thus the accuracy of revenue projection is a necessary condition for devising an appropriate framework for fiscal deficit management in Ghana. This study, therefore, analyses the revenue collection of the Customs, Excise and Preventive Service (CEPS) for the period 2008 - 2012 to devise a reasonably accurate projection for the individual tax components. This will assist in the design of an appropriate expenditure profile as a means of averting any future fiscal deficit in the country. The data were sourced from the Research and Monitoring Department of CEPS and was analyzed using time series analysis. Overall, the study reports a satisfactory level of revenue performance of the three tax heads; Import Duty, <b>Import</b> <b>VAT</b> and Petroleum Tax. The study concludes that the current revenue profile of CEPS is sustainable with prospect for significant improvement in subsequent years. The accuracy measures were employed on the various tax inputs and their mean percentage errors, mean absolute deviation and mean squared deviations were compared to decide on which method will be the pest model for revenue projection. As regard to the results obtained the growth curve model will be the preferred method in forecasting revenues in the Customs Excise and Preventive Service in Ghana...|$|E

The detection of price outliers has been proven useful in a-posteriori controls conducted by EU customs services on relatively recent transactions. The price outlier detection procedure, when applied to appropriate trade datasets, produces outliers-free data on which reliable estimates can be calculated for the market prices of the traded products: these estimates are called “fair prices”. These estimates can be used as a support to the determination of the customs value at the moment of the customs formalities or for post-clearance checks.

This topic is very important because the current government is implementing the VAT system for supplies related to goods and services, which are sold and <b>imported</b> into Kosovo. <b>VAT</b> tax is the biggest potential source for increasing revenue in the Kosovo budget. As a result there is a need to change the law related to this tax. The main goal of this project was to assess possible changes to the VAT system, and provide suggestions how to ensure a positive impact on the Kosovo budget. In order to accomplish this goal six questions were raised. To gain potential answers, an extensive survey was conducted. There were distributed 100 questionnaires to businesses and other 100 questionnaires to individual consumers. 61 completed questionnaire from businesses and 50 completed questionnaires from individual customers were received back. An interesting finding are different identified advantages of VAT implementation from businesses and from individual taxpayers. Those questionnaires were analyzed with SPSS and MS Excel. For this project, government data was collected from different ministries and from Kosovo Customs. In addition, a comparative method, comparing the tax system of Kosovo with countries in the region, tax rates, and their participation in the general revenue budget was used...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} value-added taxes (VATs) on international trade. Destination-based VATs are commonly thought to encourage exports, since exports are exempt from tax while imports are taxed. Economic theory implies that exchange rate adjustment prevents destination-based VATs from affecting exports and imports, since exchange rate appreciation completely undoes the effects of introducing a VAT. Indeed, this proposition is so well accepted among economists {{that it has not}} been subjected to serious prior testing. Evidence from 136 countries in 2000 indicates instead that reliance on VATs is associated with fewer exports and <b>imports.</b> Countries using <b>VATs</b> have one-third fewer exports than do countries not using VATs, and 10 percent greater VAT revenue is associated with two percent fewer exports. A similar pattern appears in an unbalanced panel of 168 countries from 1950 - 2000, in which VAT use is associated with 12 percent fewer exports. These patterns persist with the inclusion of income and geographic controls, and while the effect of VATs on exports is stronger among low-income countries than it is among high-income countries, there is a significant negative effect of VATs on exports even among high-income countries. The behavior of American multinational firms in 1999 is consistent: ten percent greater local VAT collections are associated with 5 percent fewer exports by local American-owned affiliates. Two features of VAT implementation may account for these effects: VATs tend to be imposed at higher rates on traded goods than on nontraded goods, and exporters often receive only incomplete VAT rebates...|$|R

FIFA (Federation Internationale de Football Association), confirmed that SAFA may have the right to serve as a host for the 2010 FIFA World Cup, but in order to qualify 17 guarantees were to be given by South African government to FIFA which is a general requirement for all host cities. These guarantees will be provided by various government departments focusing on the financial environment, safety and security, intellectual property and marketing rights, transport and telecommunications as well as custom duties, other taxes and duties and levies by the Minister of Finance. The government of The Republic of South Africa issued several guarantees that they would comply with to meet certain requirements set out by FIFA for World Cup hosts (Wilson, 2008 : 1). These include, inter alia, the provision of taxation relief for qualifying individuals and entities. Trevor Manuel, former Minister of Finance, included certain provisions in the RLAA, to give effect to FIFA’s requirements. The RLAA created a tax-free bubble around the FIFA-designated sites so that profits on consumable and semi-durable goods sold within these areas will not be subject to Income tax; nor will VAT be levied. Tax relief will be given on specific goods and services for qualifying taxpayers, as defined in the Income Tax Act 58 / 1962 ("The Income Tax Act"), (Wilson, 2008 : 1).
