40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to present actual {{calculation}} approaches and design aspects of <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams.</b> The analytical calculation of design relevant stresses in the membrane of <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> is too vague. Therefore, finite element analyses are {{needed to get the}} stresses of the multi-ply composite material with cover layers of rubber. Because of the rubber layers the <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> are sometimes called rubber dams. In the end of the actual investigations, there should be a design concept for <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> accordant to the Eurocode-concept. Stress concentration factors, gained of finite element calculations, lead to the relevant stresses. Reduction factors for the different material behaviours are determined independent of numerous calculations...|$|R
40|$|The {{writer is}} {{encouraged}} {{that more and}} more <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> are being built in the world for a wider variety of purposes. Both Vietnam and Bangladesh recently saw their first <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams.</b> In addition, higher dams are also possible. The writer wishes to point out that apart from the dam 2 ̆ 7 s capability for flood mitigation there are other notable advantages. <b>Inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> may be installed in extremely cold climates. Steel gates may be "frozen" (gate jamming) under such temperatures, whereas <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> are still operable. Another problem associated with "frozen" steel gates is the flooding upstream caused by ice formation at the steel gates. Broadwater Dam, Missouri River, Montana (Bridgestone 1982, 1997) is an example of such an application in a cold climate...|$|R
40|$|In {{general the}} {{coefficient}} of discharge for various types of measuring structures constructed in an open channel can be found from a standard formula. These structures such as a broad-crested weir, sharp-crested weir and circular-crested weir have a constant shape under all overflow conditions; therefore {{the relationship between the}} head and discharge over the structures can be found. In the case of <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> this relationship is more complex than traditional measuring structures because the dimensions of <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> may be varied due to internal pressure, overflow head and downstream water head. In this study {{the coefficient of}} discharge for <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> was determined from the experimental data under different overflow heads and internal pressures for an air inflated dam...|$|R
2500|$|Waverly {{was caught}} {{somewhat}} {{unprepared for the}} river's height, causing officials to scramble; the river crested locally at [...] on June 10, with a second crest of 13.73ft experienced on June 15. More than 2500 people were evacuated. [...] Much of the town was inundated with many homes and businesses experiencing flood damage. [...] In the flood's aftermath 151 homes were reported to be flood - impacted, with 69 of the properties eventually being bought out by the city.

40|$|The {{history of}} the use of <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> has been a long one in Hong Kong. The first three <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> were {{constructed}} in the sixties {{as an integral part of}} the Plover Cove Water Supply Scheme. Up to December 1996, a total of 16 <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> had been constructed. The use of rubber as a construction material has been subject to much skepticism. There are many reasons for this and one of them is clearly the problem of durability. Despite the many problems, rubber dams have been successfully implemented in Hong Kong. Most of the rubber dams in Hong Kong had been constructed by the Agriculture and Fisheries Department, Hong Kong Government, for the replacement of polluted agricultural weirs which were still in use. A rubber <b>dam</b> is <b>inflatable</b> and deflatable; when it is inflated, it serves as an agricultural weir (low-level dam) and when it is deflated it functions as a flood mitigation device. This note reviews the problems associated with the application of the technology in Hong Kong. Some countermeasures are suggested. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

50|$|To date, DC Water has {{significantly}} reduced CSOs by eliminating approximately 40 {{percent of the}} overflows through a $140 million construction and mitigation program. This investment included <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> to catch and store overflows during rain storms; tide gates to keep river water from flowing into the sewer system; sewer separation to eliminate CSO outfalls; and pumping station construction and rehabilitation to increase flow capacity.|$|R
40|$|The Hong Kong {{government}} {{has embarked on}} a project titled Domolition and Realignment of Agricultural Weirs in which polluted wries located in major streams are being replaced by <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams.</b> The dams are capable of being deflated authomatically prior to a flood. This characteristic is advantageous since Hong Kong is subject to flooding during severe rainstorms. The ease of inflation and deflation allows the dams to be routinely cleaned of the deposited silt and accumulated debris. Thus, they are of great benefit in the abatement of pollution...|$|R
50|$|The Salt River {{bed in the}} Phoenix {{metropolitan}} area is often either dry or flowing to a trickle, with the river's water being entirely diverted to agricultural and other uses upriver. Since Tempe Town Lake uses artificial structures and the natural riverbed to form the lake, the <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> confining the lake must be lowered in periods of high runoff to permit {{the passage of the}} Salt River itself. The lake has released water on multiple occasions as the river levels rise normally due to heavy rain or winter snow run off.|$|R

50|$|<b>Inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> can {{be filled}} with water, air or both. They are low {{pressure}} - typically 4 to 10 psi. The present trend suggests an increased use of air-filled membranes {{because they can be}} deflated or inflated more rapidly, and they are little affected by freezing conditions. Characteristic dimensions cover typically lengths of about 100 m with specially-made membranes up to 200-m wide, dam heights usually less than 5-m but some special designs might be up to 10-m high. The membrane is usually deflated for large overflows. It is however common practice to allow small spillages over the inflated dam. During overflows greater than 20% over-topping, vibrations might result from fluid-structure interactions, and the instabilities might damage or destroy the rubber membrane. Several failures were experienced (e.g. CHANSON 1996). In practice, a deflector (i.e. fin) is installed on the downstream face of the rubber dam to project the nappe away from the membrane, hence preventing rubber membrane vibrations.|$|R

40|$|Rubber dams are {{flexible}} hydraulic structures {{consisting of}} a rubberized fabric dam body, a concrete foundation, a control room housing mechanical and electrical equipment and an inlet/outlet piping system. These dams have become popular because of the following advantages: long span and adaptable to different side slopes; short construction period; easy maintenance and repair; low project life cycle cost; earthquake resistant; adaptable to adverse conditions; and environmentally friendly. To increase their competitiveness for a larger share in the international market, manufacturers, in cooperation with research and development institutions, are developing new types of high performance rubber dams {{to meet the needs}} of more demanding application conditions. New rubber dam types that are drawing interest are as follows: rubber dams with inspection gallery; rubber dams with different deflation modes; <b>inflatable</b> <b>dams</b> with steel plate; innovative fish-way; rubber dams with flood mitigation and safety; dams with increasing water storage capacity and power output; dams that reduce sediment problems; dams with irrigation and water supply; dams with ground water recharge; dams with navigation; and dams with water environment improvement...|$|R

50|$|The City of Marysville Upground Reservoir project, {{located in}} the City of Marysville,Ohio, had a total budget of $24,000,000. The Marysville (Ohio) Upground Reservoir Project {{consisted}} of four contracts providing a complete system to capture water from Mill Creek, pump it to the new reservoir and ultimately deliver the water to the Marysville Water Plant. One of the four contracts encompassed {{the construction of a}} dam, intake structure and a pump station building, in addition to the installation of an <b>inflatable</b> <b>dam</b> purchased under a separate contract between the city and dam manufacturer. Depending on the flow rates and water levels in Mill Creek, the pump station is able to provide 26 million gallons of water daily to the reservoir.|$|E
5000|$|At {{approximately}} 9:45 pm MST on July 20, 2010, {{one section}} of the <b>inflatable</b> <b>dam</b> on the west end burst, thus releasing water up to [...] into the normally dry Salt River bed. The lake began draining immediately. Emergency workers rushed to clear the area and the lake's outdoor warning sirens started wailing, both within minutes. By the next morning the lake had lost about three fourths of its normal water. The dam breach left some areas of the lake with three feet of water or less; the average lake depth is about 16 ft. Most of the 10,000 fish in the lake were swept downstream, but those that remained were expected to die within five days; fishing was not expected to resume until a year after the lake refilled.|$|E
50|$|<b>Inflatable</b> rubber <b>dams</b> are {{cylindrical}} rubber fabrics placed across channels, {{streams and}} weir or dam crests {{to raise the}} upstream water level when inflated. The membrane is a multi-layer fabric made of synthetic fibre (usually nylon) and rubberised on one or both sides. The fabric is quite flexible and yet exhibits good wear-resistance characteristics. A layer of stainless steel mesh or ceramic chips can be embedded in the surface layer to reduce or prevent vandal damage.|$|R
