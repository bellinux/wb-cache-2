5000|$|An {{exhibition}} of nine artists, [...] "9" [...] (1992), held at MAMY, {{served as the}} spring-board for several projects in the following years, leading {{to the creation of}} the Armenian Center for Contemporary Experimental Art (ACCEA). Veranian has created a number of installation art pieces including a <b>glass</b> <b>balloon.</b> With an expanded group of artists, an exhibition entitled Cuckoo Clacked (1992), and Identification (1993) were held at MAMY. Church (1994), devoted to the artist's grandfather Stepan Hovhannes, who was a priest in the Armenian Apostolic Church in Athens, consisted of dust, steam heating pipes and graffiti on the floor. This installation has been exhibited at MAMY. Corpus Hermeticum (1995) included green glass vintage wine jugs with hand print engravings inside, and graffiti on the floor. Zeazea Beazea, Sibyl, Metamorphoses (1996) was a collection of perfumery accessories and jars of cream, women's jewelry, jewelry boxes, combs, etc.- a drama of an aging beautiful woman. B2 Stealth Bomber, Buried Cities (1996) was a triangular shape on the concrete floor with a striped track. Later he displayed a smaller installation work, called Why Not, the Violet Silk Petticoats (1996) which consisted of а yarn for the knitting.|$|E
40|$|One of the {{measures}} to increase road traffic safety in Croatia is the introduction of obligatory use of daily lights on vehicles in road traffic during driving, regardless of the visibility {{and the time of}} day. The paper describes the new original technical and technological procedure of analysing automotive light bulbs in order to find the traces of glass particles of the broken <b>glass</b> <b>balloon</b> in the marginal cases of action of small inertia forces generated as result of a traffic accident. Investigations of light bulbs in traffic accidents had been rarely done before; therefore the subject of this scientific research is the analysis of the light bulb filament used in automobiles to light the road ahead and to give light signals, i. e. all the light signalling devices on the automobile using the new technical and technological procedure by means of SEM/EDX method. The scientific research has improved the investigation procedure in analysing the light bulbs on automobiles in determining whether at the moment of the traffic accident the regulatory lights were switched on. In determining the responsibility of participants for causing the traffic accident, such a fact may sometimes be of crucial significance. KEY WORDS: traffic accident, light bulb, technical and technological procedure, lights in traffic, microscope, molten glass particle...|$|E
40|$|Editors note: What {{looks like}} a fertilized egg, flows like water, is stuffed with cat-alysts and exotic {{nanostructures}} and may have the potential of making the current retail gasoline infrastructure compat-ible with hydrogen-based vehicles of the future – not to mention also contributing to arenas such as nuclear proliferation and global warming? Take another look again at the photo on the cover. The microscopic perme-able <b>glass</b> <b>balloon</b> whose shell has been partially removed to reveal its palla-dium contents {{will give you a}} sense of what’s in store for the future, if the SRNL researchers are right. ACerS is honored to be the first to publish information on this startling and promising discovery and the captivating, never-before-seen photos of these glass microspheres in action. The Savannah River National Lab has devel-oped a novel class of materials for a variety of potentially new and exciting applications. This unique mate-rial is called porous wall, hollow glass microspheres. It consists of tiny glass microballoons that are smaller than the diameter of a human hair. The distinguishing characteristic of the SRNL glass microspheres is the interconnected porosity of their thin outer walls that can be pro-duced on a scale of 100 Å to 3, 000 Å. The porosity in these one-of-a-kind microspheres results in unique and desirable properties. For example, one can use these open chan-nels to fill the microballons with absorbents as well as other materials...|$|E
40|$|A {{repeated}} thermomechanical treatment (RTMT) {{was adopted}} {{to control the}} microstructure of a glass-balloon-dispersed aluminum alloy (AC 3 A) composite. The RTMT, which involves the repetition of a multi-step process and followed by heat treatment, was applied to a cast plate of the composite. The composite was successfully worked into a rod or sheet by either swaging or flat rolling. The porous <b>glass</b> <b>balloons</b> were deformed or cracked so that the composite could be worked easily. The swaged material exhibited higher tensile strength, Young's modulus, and elongation {{as compared to the}} cast material. The composite materials also exhibited excellent energy absorption properties...|$|R
50|$|A snifter (also called brandy snifter, cognac <b>glass,</b> or <b>balloon)</b> {{is a type}} of stemware, a short-stemmed glass whose vessel has a wide {{bottom and}} a {{relatively}} narrow top. It is mostly used to serve aged brown spirits such as bourbon, brandy, and whisky.|$|R
5000|$|In Spain, a {{variation}} on the drink called Gin-Tonic has become popular. This differs from a traditional gin and tonic as it is served in <b>balloon</b> <b>glass</b> [...] or coupe glass with plenty of ice and a garnish tailored to the flavours of the gin. The drink could be fruit-based but the use of herbs and vegetables, reflecting the gin's botanicals, is increasingly popular. The <b>balloon</b> <b>glass</b> is used because the aromas of the drink can gather at its opening for the drinker to more easily appreciate.|$|R
6000|$|The {{fine dust}} {{blown out of}} Krakatoa was found, under the microscope, to consist of {{excessively}} thin, transparent plates or irregular specks of pumice--which inconceivably minute fragments were caused by enormous steam pressure in the interior and the sudden expansion of the masses blown out into the atmosphere. Of this glassy dust, that which was blown into the regions beyond the clouds must have been much finer even than that which was examined. These glass fragments were said by Dr Flugel to contain either innumerable air-bubbles or minute needle-like crystals, or both. Small though these vesicles were when ejected from the volcano, they would become still smaller by bursting when they suddenly reached a much lower pressure of atmosphere at a great height. Some of them, however, owing to tenacity of material and other causes, might have failed to burst and would remain floating in the upper air as perfect microscopic <b>glass</b> <b>balloons.</b> Thus the dust was a mass of particles of every conceivable shape, and so fine that no watches, boxes, or instruments were tight enough to exclude from their interior even {{that portion of the}} dust which was heavy enough to remain on earth! ...|$|R
50|$|Glasses and mugs {{of various}} types are an {{important}} part of tableware, as beverages are important parts of a meal. Vessels to hold alcoholic beverages such as wine, whether red, white, sparkling tend to be quite specialised in form, with for example Port wine glasses, beer <b>glasses,</b> brandy <b>balloons,</b> aperitif and liqueur glasses all having a different shapes. Water glasses, juice glasses and hot chocolate mugs are also differentiated. Their appearance as part of the tableware depends on the meal and the style of table arrangement.|$|R

The {{bodies in the}} gondola were badly maimed; Fedoseenko's skull had disintegrated, probably after impacting a tempered <b>glass</b> porthole. The <b>balloon</b> envelope fell 4 kilometres from the gondola and its fabric was quickly looted by local villagers.|$|R
40|$|Prosthetic restorations {{that have}} been tried in the patient's mouth are {{potential}} sources of infection. In order to avoid cross-infection, protocols for infection control should be established in dental office and laboratory. This study evaluated the antimicrobial efficacy of disinfectants on full metal crowns contaminated with microorganisms. Full crowns cast in a Ni-Cr alloy were assigned to one control group (n= 6) and 5 experimental groups (n= 18). The crowns were placed in flat-bottom <b>glass</b> <b>balloons</b> and were autoclaved. A microbial suspension of each type of strain - S. aureus, P. aeruginosa, S. mutans, E. faecalis and C. albicans- was aseptically added to each experimental group, the crowns being allowed for contamination during 30 min. The contaminated specimens were placed into recipients with the chemical disinfectants (1 % and 2 % sodium hypochlorite and 2 % glutaraldehyde) for 5, 10 and 15 min. Thereafter, the crowns were placed into tubes containing different broths and incubated at 35 ºC. The control specimens were contaminated, immersed in distilled water for 20 min and cultured in Thioglycollate broth at 35 ºC. Microbial growth assay was performed by qualitative visual examination after 48 h, 7 and 12 days. Microbial growth was noticed only in the control group. In the experimental groups, turbidity of the broths was not observed, regardless of the strains and immersion intervals, thus indicating absence of microbial growth. In conclusion, all chemical disinfectants were effective in preventing microbial growth onto full metal crowns...|$|R
5000|$|Masson´s {{mannequin}} attracted great {{attention because}} he had squeezed its head into a bird cage covered with red fish made of celluloid. It was gagged with a ribbon made of velvet, with a pansy placed at its mouth. Underneath, red paprika caught in traps {{grew out of a}} ground of coarse salt grains. The paprika pointed upwards to the mannequin's genitalia, like many tiny erections. Marcel Duchamp dressed his mannequin in a man's felt hat, shirt, tie and jacket; a red bulb blinked in the breast pocket, and {{the lower part of the}} mannequin was naked - [...] "Rose Selavy (Duchamp's alter ego) in one of her provocative and androgynous moods". Yves Tanguy draped it with phallus-like spindles, Man Ray arranged his figure with big tears and decorated its head with pitch pipes and <b>glass</b> <b>balloons.</b> Wolfgang Paalen used mushrooms and moss to give his mannequin an overgrown look, and added a giant vampire-like bat; Óscar Domínguez placed an enormous siphon at the side of his mannequin. Out of the siphon an abundant jet of drapery was fired out. At the feet of his [...] "Black Widow", Max Ernst set a man with a lion head, lying on the floor and sprinkled with paint. He intended to place a glowing bulb in her underwear, exposed by her pulled-up skirt, but Breton prevented this. Only at second glance were the visitors able to realise that they were looking at [...] "artificial" [...] women.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. S) - Wichita State University, College of Engineering, Dept. of Mechanical EngineeringCarbon {{nanomaterials}} {{have recently}} been discovered which possess many unique physical properties. Multiple {{attempts have been made}} to integrate these materials into new technologies, including carbon nanocomposites with the goal of vastly improving the performance of these products. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of carbon nanofibers (CNF), multi-walled carbon nanotubes (MWNT), and buckminsterfullerene’s (buckyballs) into Cytec’s Corfil 625 - 1, an existing one-part potting compound. The goal was to improve the compressive strength of the material while maintaining the lap shear strength and keeping the density under that of a commercially available two-part potting compound, 3 M’s EC- 3500. The use of surfactants from BYK-Chemie led to an improvement in compressive strength of 45 % when 5 wt% CNF was added. Carboxylic acid functionalization also showed improvement, however, CNF could not be added at a wt% as high as with the surfactant and a compressive strength enhancement of 11. 5 % was obtained. It was determined from SEM micrographs that preliminary mixing methods were breaking the <b>glass</b> <b>balloons</b> that were present in the 625 - 1 as provided by Cytec. As a result, the material was obtained without the microballoons and curing agent and new mixing methods were developed. The new compound allowed for greater flexibility in the mixing process, including higher shear and heating. It was also necessary to investigate the use of glass microballoons in order to replace what was not provided by Cytec. The use of S 15 glass microballoons from 3 M allowed for production of a potting compound similar to that of the 625 - 1 originally provided by Cytec. S 38 HS microballoons produced a one-part compound that was similar to the goal compound EC- 3500. Sonication for 5 hours produced better results than the hand mixing that was initially performed, increasing the compressive strength of the potting compound by 21. 7 % when 1 wt% functionalized CNF was added to the compound. MWNT of various sizes were investigated, with the smallest diameter nanotube (8 nm) providing the best improvement. A three roll mill was utilized as a new mixing method that would reduce complications and allow for the process to be scaled up producing larger batches of carbon nanocomposite. The number of times the material was run through the mill was an important parameter and a 30. 9 % improvement was acquired when the composite went through 7 times...|$|R
40|$|A warhead {{requires}} {{the most suitable}} HE (High explosives). It is necessary to determine the optimal casing and HE in the development stage of the warhead by repetition {{of a series of}} process design, trial production, and testing. Accuracy of the simulation (Hydro-code) results also requires a practically usable level. However, we have asked for the JWL (Jones-Wilkins-Lee) parameters numerically by using KHT (Kihara-Hikita-Tanaka) code, since we have not experimental instruments like a streak camera and these experiments spend great deal of time and cost. For this reason, the simulation result was different from the experiment one slightly. Recently, we can ask for the JWL parameters experimentally, using the image converter camera of Kumamoto University by the joint research activities. We hope that the accuracy of these simulations might be raised by these studies. As sample explosives, PBX (Plastics bonded explosives) which used RDX or HMX, and Comp. C- 4 were chosen. Further, new explosive of which detonation velocity was decreased by adding GMB (<b>Glass</b> micro <b>balloon)</b> to Comp. C- 4 was made. These explosives were studied by KHT code and experiment, and JWL parameters were also gotten. As the result we could get several information, so it would be reported in this paper. 1...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{investigations}} {{have assumed that}} embryos lack the capacity of physiological thermoregulation until they are large enough for their own metabolic heat production to influence nest temperatures. Contrary to intuition, reptile embryos may be capable of physiological thermoregulation. In our experiments, egg-sized objects (dead or infertile eggs, water-filled <b>balloons,</b> <b>glass</b> jars) cooled down more rapidly than they heated up, whereas live snake eggs heated more rapidly than they cooled. In a nest with diel thermal fluctuations, that hysteresis could increase the embryo’s effective incubation temperature. The mechanisms for controlling rates of thermal exchange are unclear, but may involve facultative adjustment of blood flow. Heart rates of snake embryos were higher during cooling than during heating, the opposite pattern to that seen in adult reptiles. Our data challenge the view of reptile eggs as thermally passive, and suggest that embryos of reptile species with large eggs can influence their own rates of heating and cooling...|$|R

They were heated at 1000 °C for about one {{second in the}} small electric rotary furnace and then the hollow <b>glass</b> microspheres (Silas <b>Balloon)</b> were separated from them by pouring into water. Chemical analysis were conducted on these hollow glass microspheres composing of volcanic glass. The volcanic glasses of eighteen species have the following chemical compositions; Ig. loss 0. 1 ~ 0. 61, SiO_ 2 74. 42 ~ 78. 32, Al_ 2 O_ 3 12. 20 ~ 14. 06, Fe_ 2 O_ 3 0. 60 ~ 1. 63, CaO 0. 44 ~ 3. 42, MgO 0. 29 ~ 1. 61, Na_ 2 O 2. 84 ~ 4. 10, K_ 2 O 2. 82 ~ 5. 09 %.

50|$|Hornig’s art {{considers}} {{the built environment}} and incorporates everyday architectural elements like doors, walls, and windows, as well as industrial materials such as concrete. These appear in both sculpture and site-specific installations. One 2002 sculptural work, Balcony, installed a full stucco balcony - complete with a drying towel - floating above {{the floor in a}} gallery. In a 2005 Lisbon exhibition, Hornig created a “stone” wall out of newspaper and glue, extending along and reflecting in a glass gallery wall of windows. One major site-specific work is the Glass Façade Project, or Das Glasfassaden-Projekt, which in 2005 provided a large installation for an elementary school building at Pfeuferstraße 1, in Munich’s Sendling district. The project features silkscreen printed with transparent colors on safety <b>glass.</b> Brightly colored <b>balloons,</b> bookshelves, and seemingly billowing white sheets appear on the façade of the urban school. The silkscreened images are visible from inside the glass façade and outside of it. In certain works that incorporate architectural elements, she simplifies and omits details like door handles and adjusts an item’s scale in order to transform a recognizable object into a sculpture.|$|R
50|$|As {{the group}} studies for their history final, Abed (Danny Pudi) reveals he is {{actually}} studying the group’s history. Abed believes the group was destined to meet, and had crossed paths before meeting at Greendale. Abed explains in 2008, the group had several coincidental meetings between its members. Annie (Alison Brie) and Troy (Donald Glover) had attended the same high school; Annie {{had a crush on}} Troy, but he didn’t even seem to notice. Troy reveals he actually did notice, as it was her words that made Troy fake an injury so he wouldn’t {{have to deal with the}} pressures of being recruited for college football. At a party, Troy was deemed “most likely to succeed,” enraging Annie, who was also addicted to prescription drugs at the time. She screamed at Troy that he wouldn’t amount to anything, then charged through a glass door (the broken <b>glass</b> popped two <b>balloons,</b> inspiring Magnitude's catch phrase). Abed and Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) had both been at the mall one day. Shirley was buying lingerie for a romantic date with her husband, Andre (Malcolm-Jamal Warner), while Abed had been standing outside a movie theater to warn moviegoers to not see Star Wars Episode I. Abed accosts two little boys who attempt to go see the movie (who happen to be Shirley’s children), causing Abed to get a restraining order from the theater and attend therapy sessions. As Abed is heading to meet the therapist, he spots Annie stealing the doctor’s prescription pad, and warns the doctor and presumably leads to Annie getting caught. Shirley is forced to leave her husband on a date to pick up her kids, the same restaurant where Jeff (Joel McHale) and his client, a stripper, are also eating. Jeff had successfully defended her in a case, where Britta (Gillian Jacobs) had been staging a rally to support the case. The stripper tells Jeff she was talking to a married man, implied to be Andre. Having just received news that he is to be disbarred due to a lack of a college degree, Jeff encourages her to pursue him.|$|R
