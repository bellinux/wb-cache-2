5|$|A highly active predator, {{the river}} otter has adapted to hunting in water, and eats aquatic and semiaquatic animals. The {{vulnerability}} and seasonal availability of prey animals mainly governs its food habits and prey choices. This availability {{is influenced by}} the following factors: <b>detectability</b> and mobility of the prey, habitat availability for the various prey species, environmental factors, such as water depth and temperature, and seasonal changes in prey supply and distribution in correspondence with otter foraging habitat.|$|E
5|$|As intended, {{it would}} have functioned as a stealth helicopter, {{incorporating}} {{a number of different}} techniques and technologies in order to reduce its radar cross-section (RCS) along with other areas of visibility and <b>detectability.</b> The exterior surfaces of the RAH-66 were faceted and covered with both radar-absorbent material (RAM) coatings and infrared-suppressant paint; {{as a result of these}} combined measures, the Comanche's RCS was claimed to have been 360 times smaller than that of the AH-64 Apache attack helicopter. The acoustic signature of the rotorcraft was also reported to be noticeably lower than comparative helicopters; this reduction had been partially achieved through the adoption of an all-composite five-blade main rotor and pioneering canted tail rotor assembly.|$|E
5|$|The Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk was {{the first}} {{operational}} aircraft designed to use stealth technology to minimize its radar cross-section; it began operations in secrecy in 1983. Its low <b>detectability</b> was traded-off against performance in other areas, including reduced thrust and only subsonic speed. The aircraft's faceted shape reduced the reflection of radar back to the receiver, {{at the expense of}} making the aircraft aerodynamically unstable, requiring a fly-by-wire flight system to maintain controlled flight. The infrared signatures of stealth aircraft can be reduced by designing exhaust nozzles to mix the hot gases with cool ambient air, by placing the nozzles above the wing to conceal them from ground-based observers, and by avoiding the use of afterburners, as with the Northrop Grumman B-2 Spirit bomber.|$|E
25|$|The enzyme {{horseradish}} peroxidase (HRP), {{found in the}} plant, is used extensively in molecular biology and biochemistry primarily {{for its ability to}} amplify a weak signal and increase <b>detectability</b> of a target molecule. HRP has been used in decades of research to visualize under microscopy and assess non-quantitatively the permeability of capillaries, particularly those of the brain.|$|E
25|$|By {{having a}} single source of information, pilot {{workload}} should {{be reduced by}} removing the possibility of conflicting data {{and the need for}} cross-checking, improving situational awareness and increasing systems automation. In practice the AIS should allow the Eurofighter to identify targets at distances in excess of 150nm and acquire and auto-prioritise them at over 100nm. In addition the AIS offers the ability to automatically control emissions from the aircraft, so called EMCON (from EMissions CONtrol). This should aid in limiting the <b>detectability</b> of the Typhoon by opposing aircraft further reducing pilot workload.|$|E
25|$|Conservation – As {{with the}} {{intraspecific}} relationship, the interspecific O–A relationship implies that species {{will not only}} be at risk of extinction due to low abundance, but because species with low abundance are expected to have restricted distributions, they are at risk of local catastrophe leading to global extinction. This may be confounded by the difficulty in surveying locally rare species due to both their low <b>detectability,</b> and restricted distribution (see above). Finally, because rare species are expected to have restricted distributions, conservation programmes aimed at prioritizing sites for multi-species conservation will include fewer habitats for rare species than common species.|$|E
25|$|The {{production}} of recombinant monoclonal antibodies involves repertoire cloning or phage display/yeast display technologies. Recombinant antibody engineering involves antibody production {{by the use}} of viruses or yeast, rather than mice. These techniques rely on rapid cloning of immunoglobulin gene segments to create libraries of antibodies with slightly different amino acid sequences from which antibodies with desired specificities can be selected. The phage antibody libraries are a variant of phage antigen libraries. These techniques can be used to enhance the specificity with which antibodies recognize antigens, their stability in various environmental conditions, their therapeutic efficacy and their <b>detectability</b> in diagnostic applications. Fermentation chambers have been used for large scale antibody production.|$|E
25|$|It was an {{all-composite}} construction aircraft, {{based on}} the commercial single-engine, low-wing Windecker Eagle. The YE-5A, delivered in 1973, was used in tests relating to the radar <b>detectability</b> (commonly known as 'stealth') of composite aircraft. A single YE-5A (serial number 73-1653) was built. The YE-5A composite airframe benefited from the U.S. Army project and was shown {{to be difficult to}} detect using radar; however other components, including the metal engine, could be seen on radar. The YE-5A was destroyed in a crash during a classified project in 1985, and was replaced by a modified conventional civilian model Windecker Eagle (N4196G), to complete the project. This aircraft is disassembled and in storage in the United States Army Aviation Museum at Fort Rucker, Alabama.|$|E
25|$|After her resurrection, Psylocke {{was shown}} to be immune to all forms of psionic {{manipulations}} such as mind-reading, mind-control or mental attacks, and attempts of telepathic communication. This {{is a result of}} her brother Jamie's manipulation of the quantum strings that comprise her body. She is also immune or at least highly resistant to other psionic-based powers like the Savage Land Mutate Vertigo's disorientation power, or Nocturne's mind possessing abilities. Due to Jamie's alterations, Psylocke is also immune to any physical and mental alteration by beings who can radically restructure reality, such as Proteus. She can, however, still be killed in more traditional manners, such as being stabbed or shot. She is also at least partially resistant to magical manipulation. Somehow these various immunities also affect her <b>detectability</b> from higher order technological equipment. For example, all sensor-arrays of the Exiles Crystal Palace are not able to detect her—as if she does not even exist. Beside this immunity, she is able to use her telekinesis to modify her own molecular structure to render herself invisible to at least the naked eye.|$|E
25|$|A woman {{experiencing}} uterine blood {{not part}} of normal menstruation was classified as a zavah {{in the days of}} the Temple in Jerusalem and remained in a state of ritual impurity for 7 days prior to immersion. Today, the law of zavah remains in effect in Orthodox Judaism, in two respects. Due to extreme conditions in Roman Palestine in the time of the Amoraim, women's periods became irregular, and women became unable to determine whether or not their discharges were regular (niddah) or irregular (zavah). As a result, women adapted a stringency combining the niddah and zavah periods, refraining from intercourse and physical contact with their husbands for seven days of the zavah period following menstruation, for a total of approximately 12 days per month, which Orthodox women continue to observe today. The laws of zavah are also applied, as in Biblical times, to uterine blood discharges outside regular menstruation. Such circumstances are often interpreted leniently, however, and rabbinic stratagems have been devised to lessen their severity. Women experiencing irregularities (droplets) are sometimes advised to wear coloured underwear to mitigate the <b>detectability</b> of evidence of zavah status and hence a need to determine that a woman is a zavah.|$|E
500|$|Very {{little is}} known of Pallas's surface features. Hubble images from 2007, with a {{resolution}} around [...] per pixel, show pixel-to-pixel variation, but Pallas's albedo of 0.12 placed such features {{at the lower end}} of <b>detectability.</b> There is little variability between lightcurves obtained through visible-light and infrared filters, but there are significant deviations in the ultraviolet, suggesting large surface or compositional features near 285° (75° west longitude). Pallas's rotation appears to be prograde.|$|E
500|$|In a {{simplified}} picture, every photon spends some {{time as a}} combination of a virtual electron plus its antiparticle, the virtual positron, which rapidly annihilate each other shortly thereafter. The combination of the energy variation needed to create these particles, and the time during which they exist, fall under the threshold of <b>detectability</b> expressed by the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, ΔE·Δt≥ħ. In effect, the energy needed to create these virtual particles, ΔE, can be [...] "borrowed" [...] from the vacuum for a period of time, Δt, so that their product is no more than the reduced Planck constant, [...] Thus, for a virtual electron, Δt is at most [...]|$|E
2500|$|In 2017, {{sophisticated}} and painstaking research by NOAA scientist Jessica L. Crance and other NOAA scientists {{was able to}} definitively attribute gunshots to North Pacific right whales, and found that among the animals sampled gunshots were heard ~50 times more frequently than upcalls. Because gunshots to be used much more and {{are less likely to}} be mistaken for a humpback call, this should improve the <b>detectability</b> of right whales in the North Pacific using passive acoustic monitoring, and improve the ability to locate individual whales from ships as well.|$|E
2500|$|Physicist Robert L. Park {{has found}} it {{suspicious}} that a phenomenon should only ever appear at the limits of <b>detectability</b> of questionable statistical techniques. He cites this feature as one of Irving Langmuir's indicators of pathological science. Park pointed out that if mind really could influence matter, {{it would be easy}} for parapsychologists to measure such a phenomenon by using the alleged psychokinetic power to deflect a microbalance, which would not require any dubious statistics. [...] "he reason, of course, is that the microbalance stubbornly refuses to budge." [...] He has suggested that the reason statistical studies are so popular in parapsychology is that they introduce opportunities for uncertainty and error, which are used to support the experimenter's biases.|$|E
2500|$|If an {{electron}} is forbidden from simultaneously occupying positive-energy and negative-energy eigenstates, then the feature known as Zitterbewegung, which {{arises from the}} interference of positive-energy and negative-energy states, {{would have to be}} considered to be an unphysical prediction of time-dependent Dirac theory. [...] This conclusion may be inferred from the explanation of hole theory given in the preceding paragraph. Recent results have been published in Nature [...] in which the Zitterbewegung feature was simulated in a trapped-ion experiment. This experiment impacts the hole interpretation if one infers that the physics-laboratory experiment is not merely a check on the mathematical correctness of a Dirac-equation solution but the measurement of a real effect whose <b>detectability</b> in electron physics is still beyond reach.|$|E
2500|$|Second to <b>detectability,</b> as a {{priority}} was rejecting noise [...] and background. It is especially difficult for biowarfare agents, which are the greatest WMD challenge to detect by remote sensing rather than laboratory analysis of a sample. Methods may need to depend on signal enhancement, by clandestine dispersion of reagents {{in the area of}} interest, which variously could emit or absorb particular spectra. Fluorescent reactions are well known in the laboratory; could they be done remotely and secretly? Other approaches could pump the sample with an appropriately tuned laser, perhaps at several wavelengths. The participants stressed that the need to miniaturize sensors, which might enter the area in question using unmanned sensors, including miniaturized aerial, surface, and even subsurface vehicles.|$|E
2500|$|In 2009, {{computer}} simulations {{showed that a}} planet {{might have been able}} to form near the inner edge of Alpha Centauri B's habitable zone, which extends from 0.5 to 0.9 AU from the star. Certain special assumptions, such as considering that Alpha Centauri A and B may have initially formed with a wider separation and later moved closer to each other (as might be possible if they formed in a dense star cluster) would permit an accretion-friendly environment farther from the star. Bodies around A would be able to orbit at slightly farther distances due to A's stronger gravity. In addition, the lack of any brown dwarfs or gas giants in close orbits around A or B make the likelihood of terrestrial planets greater than otherwise. Theoretical studies on the <b>detectability</b> via radial velocity analysis have shown that a dedicated campaign of high-cadence observations with a 1-meter class telescope can reliably detect a hypothetical planet of [...] in the habitable zone of B within three years.|$|E
2500|$|To ensure {{survivability}} to {{and effectiveness}} against a target, the LRASM {{is equipped with}} a BAE Systems-designed seeker and guidance system, integrating jam-resistant GPS/INS, passive RF and threat warning receiver, an imaging infrared (IIR infrared homing) seeker with automatic scene/target matching recognition, a data-link, and passive Electronic Support Measure (ESM) and radar warning receiver sensors. [...] Artificial intelligence software combines these features to locate enemy ships and avoid neutral shipping in crowded areas. [...] Automatic dissemination of emissions data is classified, located, and identified for path of attack; the data-link allows other assets to feed the missile a real-time electronic picture of the enemy battlespace. [...] Multiple missiles can work together to share data to coordinate an attack in a swarm. [...] Aside from short, low-power data-link transmissions, the LRASM does not emit signals, which combined with the low-RCS JASSM airframe and low IR signature reduces <b>detectability.</b> [...] Unlike previous radar-only seeker-equipped missiles that went on to hit other vessels if diverted or decoyed, the multi-mode seeker ensures the correct target is hit in a specific area of the ship. [...] An LRASM can find its own target autonomously by using its active radar homing to locate ships in an area, then using passive measures once on terminal approach. [...] Like the JASSM, the LRASM is capable of hitting land targets.|$|E

50|$|Teller's initial {{research}} studies {{were focused on}} the spatial and temporal properties of a phenomenon first described by Professor Gerald Westheimer and {{sometimes referred to as}} the “Westheimer effect” or the “Westheimer function.” In this phenomenon, which Teller termed “spatial sensitization,” the <b>detectability</b> of a test light is first decreased and then increased by adding light to successively larger surrounding or annular regions. Westheimer proposed that the increase in <b>detectability</b> with surround illumination might represent the manifestation of lateral inhibition within the retina, and this possibility motivated Teller's interest in the phenomenon.|$|E
