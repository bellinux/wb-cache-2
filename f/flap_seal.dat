5000|$|Joseph Shuttleworth {{suggested}} a hydraulic tube; water pressure {{rather than a}} partial atmospheric vacuum, would propel the train. In mountainous areas where plentiful water was available, a pumping station would be unnecessary: the water would be used directly. Instead of the <b>flap</b> to <b>seal</b> the slot in the tube, a continuous shaped sealing rope, made of cloth impregnated with india-rubber would be within the pipe. Guides on the piston would lift it into position and the water pressure would hold it in place behind the train.

25|$|Each Okazaki {{fragment}} is {{preceded by}} an RNA primer, which is {{displaced by the}} procession of the next Okazaki fragment during synthesis. RNase H recognizes the DNA:RNA hybrids that are created {{by the use of}} RNA primers and is responsible for removing these from the replicated strand, leaving behind a primer:template junction. DNA polymerase α, recognizes these sites and elongates the breaks left by primer removal. In eukaryotic cells, a small amount of the DNA segment immediately upstream of the RNA primer is also displaced, creating a flap structure. This flap is then cleaved by endonucleases. At the replication fork, the gap in DNA after removal of the <b>flap</b> is <b>sealed</b> by DNA ligase I, which repairs the nicks that are left between the 3'-OH and 5'phosphate of the newly synthesized strand. Owing to the relatively short nature of the eukaryotic Okazaki fragment, DNA replication synthesis occurring discontinuously on the lagging strand is less efficient and more time consuming than leading-strand synthesis. DNA synthesis is complete once all RNA primers are removed and nicks are repaired.|$|R

40|$|The free-to-roll {{technique}} {{is used as}} a tool for predicting areas of uncommanded lateral motions. Recently, the NASA/Navy/Air Force Abrupt Wing Stall Program extended the use of this technique to the transonic speed regime. Using this technique, this paper evaluates various wing configurations on the pre-production F/A- 18 E aircraft and the Joint Strike Fighter (F- 35) aircraft. The configurations investigated include leading and trailing edge flap deflections, fences, leading edge <b>flap</b> gap <b>seals,</b> and vortex generators. These tests were conducted in the NASA Langley 16 -Foot Transonic Tunnel. The analysis used a modification of a figure-of-merit developed during the Abrupt Wing Stall Program to discern configuration effects. The results showed how the figure-of-merit can be used to schedule wing flap deflections to avoid areas of uncommanded lateral motion. The analysis also used both static and dynamic wind tunnel data to provide insight into the uncommanded lateral behavior. The dynamic data was extracted from the time history data using parameter identification techniques. In general, modifications to the pre-production F/A- 18 E resulted in shifts in angle-of-attack where uncommanded lateral activity occurred. Sealing the gap between the inboard and outboard leading-edge flaps on the Navy version of the F- 35 eliminated uncommanded lateral activity or delayed the activity to a higher angleof-attack.

The test campaign was conducted in the open-jet test section of the NASA Langley 14 - by 22 -foot Subsonic Tunnel on an 18 %-scale, semi-span Gulfstream airframe model incorporating a trailing edge flap and main landing gear. Unsteady surface pressure measurements were obtained {{from a series of}} sensors positioned along the two flap edges, and far field acoustic measurements were obtained using a 97 -microphone phased array that viewed the pressure side of the airframe. The DAMAS array deconvolution method was employed to determine the locations and strengths of relevant noise sources {{in the vicinity of the}} flap edges and the landing gear. A Coherent Output Power (COP) spectral method was used to couple the unsteady surface pressures measured along the flap edges with the phased array output. The results indicate that outboard flap edge noise is dominated by the <b>flap</b> bulb <b>seal</b> cavity with very strong COP coherence over an approximate model-scale frequency range of 1 to 5 kHz observed between the array output and those unsteady pressure sensors nearest the aft end of the cavity. An examination of experimental COP spectra for the inboard flap proved inconclusive, most likely due to a combination of coherence loss caused by decorrelation of acoustic waves propagating through the thick wind tunnel shear layer and contamination of the spectra by tunnel background noise at lower frequencies. Directivity measurements obtained from integration of DAMAS pressure-squared values over defined geometric zones around the model show that the baseline flap and landing gear are only moderately directional as a function of polar emission angle...|$|R

40|$|Poor {{thermal shock}} and {{resistance}} to crack propagation have had a negative influence on the acceptance of ceramics for components in air breathing engine applications. In comparison with their metallic counterparts, they are less predictable and there is limited historical in-use data available. They have therefore been considered primarily for non-load bearing applications such as <b>flaps</b> and <b>seals,</b> flame holders and covers. A fibrous monolith, ceramic hybrid between a Si 3 N 4 core with a weak BN interface has been evaluated for non-load bearing applications in air breathing engines where {{a high degree of}} thermal shock resistance is required. The fibrous monolith architecture confines damage to local regions and although the overall strength is typically reduced, the macroscopic damage tolerance and thermal shock resistance is improved over monolithic S 3 N 4 of similar compositions. Two different architectural scales with a cell size of 150 µm and 30 µm were investigated. Both architectures showed a similar response with no loss in strength when quenched from below 800 °C and no loss in modulus when quenched from 1000 °C into water. Cyclic thermal shock from 600 °C showed no change in modulus but at 1000 °C a gradual drop in the modulus was observed. Microstructural assessment of the Si 3 N 4 core and BN phases showed microcracking of the BN phase following thermal shock but no discernable changes in the Si 3 N 4 phase. The thermal shock resistance of the FM Si 3 N 4 / BN structure is improved over monolithic Si 3 N 4 due to the ability of the weak BN interface to preferentially microcrack and accommodate strain. Improved thermal shock resistance has been demonstrated in water quench tests as well as in a gas burner rig test where heating rates and temperatures more representative of those observed in engine applications have been investigated.
