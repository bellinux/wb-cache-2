While this was acceptable for posters, by the 1950s hot metal typesetting machines had become the main system for printing general-purpose body text, and for this system Akzidenz-Grotesk was unavailable until around 1958-9, when it was first sold on Linotype and then in 1960 on <b>Intertype</b> systems. Much printing around this time of body text accordingly used Monotype Grotesque as a lookalike.|$|E

2500|$|In the United States, Caslons {{became almost}} a genre, {{modified}} expanded with new styles such as bold, condensed, inline or with modifications such as shortened descenders to fit American common line, or lining figures. Many foundries cut (or, in many cases, pirated) their own versions. By the 1920s, American Type Founders offered a large range of styles, some numbered rather than named. (Bookman Old Style is {{a descendant of}} one of these American Caslon revivals. A series of modifications has given most modern Bookman digitisations a somewhat exaggerated appearance with extremely high x-height very unlike the original Caslon.) The hot metal typesetting companies Linotype, Monotype, <b>Intertype</b> and Ludlow, which sold machines that cast type under the control of a keyboard, brought out their own Caslon releases.|$|E

40|$|Antigenic {{characterization}} {{of human and}} animal rotaviruses by the plaque reduction neutralization assay has shown the existence of naturally occurring <b>intertypes.</b> Antiserum to M 37, a rotavirus strain isolated from an asymptomatic neonate, neutralizes both Wa and ST 3 strains, which are classified as serotype 1 and serotype 4 human rotaviruses, respectively. Likewise, antiserum to SB- 1 A, a porcine rotavirus, neutralizes rotavirus strains belonging to serotype 4 or 5. Plaque reduction neutralization assay of reassortant rotaviruses produced in vitro from these <b>intertypes</b> indicates that these viruses share one antigenically related outer capsid protein, VP 3, with one serotype and another antigenically related outer capsid protein, VP 7, with the other serotype. Thus, M 37 is related to ST 3 {{on the basis of}} its fourth-gene product, VP 3, and to Wa {{on the basis of its}} ninth-gene product, VP 7, whereas SB- 1 A is related to Gottfried (serotype 4 porcine rotavirus) via VP 7 and to OSU (serotype 5 porcine rotavirus) via VP 3. RNA-RNA hybridization studies revealed a high degree of homology between the VP 3 or VP 7 gene segments responsible for shared serotype specificity. Thus, the fourth gene segments of M 37 and ST 3 were highly homologous, while M 37 and Wa had homology between their ninth gene segments. SB- 1 A and Gottfried were homologous not only with respect to the ninth gene but had complete homology in all other genes except the fourth gene. The fourth gene of SB- 1 A was highly homologous with the fourth gene of OSU. These observations suggested that SB- 1 A was a naturally occurring reassortant between Gottfried-like and OSU-like porcine rotavirus strains. Our observations also suggested that <b>intertypes</b> may result from genetic reassortment in nature...|$|R

50|$|Despite initial {{liquidity}} problems, <b>Intertype</b> {{was quite}} successful in later years, producing mixer machines, high speed machines, {{and the first}} photo-type compositor. In 1957, <b>Intertype</b> merged with Harris-Seybold, a manufacturer of presses and paper cutters, to become Harris-Intertype Corporation. After the merger, the Harris-Intertype Fotosetter was introduced. It was the first photo-typesetting machine and was based upon the standard <b>Intertype</b> machine, replacing the brass type matrices with small film negatives and instead of casting, used these to expose photographic paper.|$|E

Most of the original patents for the Linotype had expired and so the basic works of the <b>Intertype</b> were essentially the same, though incorporating at least 51 improvement patents. The standard <b>Intertype</b> could cast type up to thirty points and they also offered a [...] "Composing Stick Attachment" [...] that allowed their caster {{to be used to}} cast headlines up to 60 points.|$|E
