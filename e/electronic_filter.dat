5|$|The {{elements}} of a passive linear electrical network consist of inductors, capacitors and resistors which have the properties of inductance, elastance (inverse capacitance) and resistance, respectively. The mechanical counterparts of these properties are, respectively, mass, stiffness and damping. In most <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> designs, only inductor and capacitor elements {{are used in the}} body of the filter (although the filter may be terminated with resistors at the input and output). Resistances are not present in a theoretical filter composed of ideal components and only arise in practical designs as unwanted parasitic elements. Likewise, a mechanical filter would ideally consist only of components with the properties of mass and stiffness, but in reality some damping is present as well.|$|E

25|$|This {{can also}} {{be viewed as a}} high-pass <b>electronic</b> <b>filter.</b> It is a filter with a single zero at DC (i.e., where angular {{frequency}} nbsp&radians) and gain. The high-pass characteristics of a differentiating amplifier (i.e., the low-frequency zero) can lead to stability challenges when the circuit is used in an analog servo loop (e.g., in a PID controller with a significant derivative gain). In particular, as a root locus analysis would show, increasing feedback gain will drive a closed-loop pole toward marginal stability at the DC zero introduced by the differentiator.|$|E
25|$|Polypropylene film {{capacitors}} {{meet the}} criteria for stability Class 1 capacitors, and have low electrical losses and nearly linear behavior over a very wide temperature and frequency range. They are used for oscillators and resonant circuits; for <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> applications with high quality factor (Q) such as high-pass filters, low-pass filters and band-pass filters {{as well as for}} tuning circuits; for audio crossovers in loudspeakers; in sample and hold A/D converters and in peak voltage detectors. Tight capacitance tolerances are required for timing applications in signal lights or pulse width generators to control the speed of motors, PP film capacitors are also well-suited because of their very low leakage current.|$|E
500|$|Wilhelm Cauer (24 June 1900 – 22 April 1945) was a German {{mathematician}} and scientist. He is most {{noted for}} his work on the analysis and synthesis of electrical filters and his work {{marked the beginning of the}} field of network synthesis. [...] Prior to his work, <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> design used techniques which accurately predicted filter behaviour only under unrealistic conditions. This required a certain amount of experience on the part of the designer to choose suitable sections to include in the design. Cauer placed the field on a firm mathematical footing, providing tools that could produce exact solutions to a given specification for the design of an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter.</b>|$|E

50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>filters</b> were {{originally}} entirely passive consisting of resistance, inductance and capacitance. Active technology makes design easier and opens up new possibilities in filter specifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>electronic</b> <b>filters</b> are linear filters, {{regardless}} of {{other aspects of}} their design. See the article on linear filters for details on their design and analysis.|$|R
500|$|Ladder {{topology}} can {{be extended}} without limit and is much used in filter designs. [...] There are many variations on ladder topology, {{some of which are}} discussed in the <b>Electronic</b> <b>filter</b> topology and Composite image filter articles.|$|E
500|$|Some of the {{impedance}} {{terms and}} section terms {{used in this}} article are pictured in the diagram below. Image theory defines quantities in terms of an infinite cascade of two-port sections, {{and in the case of}} the filters being discussed, an infinite ladder network of L-sections. [...] Here [...] "L" [...] should not be confused with the inductance L – in <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> topology, [...] "L" [...] refers to the specific filter shape which resembles inverted letter [...] "L".|$|E
500|$|Prototype {{filters are}} <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> designs {{that are used}} as a {{template}} to produce a modified filter design for a particular application. [...] They are an example of [...] a nondimensionalised design from which the desired filter can be scaled or transformed. They are most often seen in regard to electronic filters and especially linear analogue passive filters. [...] However, in principle, the method {{can be applied to}} any kind of linear filter or signal processing, including mechanical, acoustic and optical filters.|$|E

50|$|Twenty five patents {{were issued}} by the U.S. Patent Office to Bode for his inventions. The patents covered areas such as data {{transmission}} networks, <b>electronic</b> <b>filters,</b> amplifiers, averaging mechanisms, data smoothing networks and artillery computers.|$|R
500|$|A {{mechanical}} filter is {{a signal}} processing filter usually used {{in place of}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> at radio frequencies. [...] Its purpose {{is the same as}} that of a normal electronic filter: to pass a range of signal frequencies, but to block others. [...] The filter acts on mechanical vibrations which are the analogue of the electrical signal. [...] At the input and output of the filter, transducers convert the electrical signal into, and then back from, these mechanical vibrations.|$|E
500|$|Constant k filters, also k-type filters, are {{a type of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> {{designed}} {{using the}} image method. [...] They are the original and simplest filters produced by this methodology and consist of a ladder network of identical sections of passive components. Historically, {{they are the first}} filters that could approach the ideal filter frequency response to within any prescribed limit {{with the addition of a}} sufficient number of sections. However, they are rarely considered for a modern design, the principles behind them having been superseded by other methodologies which are more accurate in their prediction of filter response.|$|E
500|$|A {{waveguide}} filter is an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> that {{is constructed}} with waveguide technology. [...] Waveguides are hollow metal tubes inside which an electromagnetic wave may be transmitted. [...] Filters are devices used to allow signals at some frequencies to pass (the passband), {{while others are}} rejected (the stopband). [...] Filters are a basic component of electronic engineering designs and have numerous applications. [...] These include selection of signals and limitation of noise. [...] Waveguide filters are most useful in the microwave band of frequencies, where they are a convenient size and have low loss. [...] Examples of microwave filter use are found in satellite communications, telephone networks, and television broadcasting.|$|E

50|$|A {{first order}} RL circuit {{is one of}} the {{simplest}} analogue infinite impulse response <b>electronic</b> <b>filters.</b> It consists of a resistor and an inductor, either in series driven by a voltage source or in parallel driven by a current source.|$|R
50|$|<b>Electronic</b> <b>filters</b> are {{particularly}} important in subtractive synthesis, being designed to pass some frequency regions through unattenuated while significantly attenuating ("subtracting") others. The low-pass filter is most frequently used, but band-pass filters, band-reject filters and high-pass filters are also sometimes available.|$|R
500|$|... m-derived filters or m-type {{filters are}} {{a type of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> {{designed}} using the image method. They were invented by Otto Zobel in the early 1920s. This filter type was originally intended for use with telephone multiplexing and was an improvement on the existing constant k type filter. The main problem being addressed was the need to achieve a better match of the filter into the terminating impedances. In general, all filters designed by the image method fail to give an exact match, but the m-type filter is a big improvement with suitable choice of the parameter m. The m-type filter section has a further advantage in {{that there is a}} rapid transition from the cut-off frequency of the pass band to a pole of attenuation just inside the stop band. Despite these advantages, there is a drawback with m-type filters; at frequencies past the pole of attenuation, the response starts to rise again, and m-types have poor stop band rejection. For this reason, filters designed using m-type sections are often designed as composite filters with a mixture of k-type and m-type sections and different values of m at different points to get the optimum performance from both types.|$|E
500|$|A {{distributed}} element filter is an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> {{in which}} capacitance, inductance and resistance (the {{elements of the}} circuit) are not localised in discrete capacitors, inductors and resistors {{as they are in}} conventional filters. Its purpose is to allow a range of signal frequencies to pass, but to block others. Conventional filters are constructed from inductors and capacitors, and the circuits so built are described by the lumped element model, which considers each element to be [...] "lumped together" [...] at one place. That model is conceptually simple, but it becomes increasingly unreliable as the frequency of the signal increases, or equivalently as the wavelength decreases. The distributed element model applies at all frequencies, and is used in transmission line theory; many distributed element components are made of short lengths of transmission line. In the distributed view of circuits, the elements are distributed along the length of conductors and are inextricably mixed together. The filter design is usually concerned only with inductance and capacitance, but because of this mixing of elements they cannot be treated as separate [...] "lumped" [...] capacitors and inductors. There is no precise frequency above which distributed element filters must be used but they are especially associated with the microwave band (wavelength less than one metre).|$|E
2500|$|This circuit can {{be viewed}} as a {{low-pass}} <b>electronic</b> <b>filter,</b> one with a single pole at DC (i.e., where [...] ) and with gain.|$|E
50|$|Grinbergs and his {{collaborators}} wrote many papers {{on the design of}} electrical circuits and <b>electronic</b> <b>filters,</b> stemming from his radio work. He earned the State Prize of the Latvian SSR in 1980 for his research on nonlinear electronic circuit theory.|$|R

5|$|The most {{important}} uses of yttrium are LEDs and phosphors, particularly the red phosphors in television set {{cathode ray tube}} (CRT) displays. Yttrium is also used {{in the production of}} electrodes, electrolytes, <b>electronic</b> <b>filters,</b> lasers, superconductors, various medical applications, and tracing various materials to enhance their properties.|$|R
2500|$|Because of the {{alternating}} {{nature of}} the input AC sine wave, the process of rectification alone produces a DC current that, though unidirectional, consists of pulses of current. [...] Many applications of rectifiers, such as power supplies for radio, television and computer equipment, require a steady constant DC current (as would be produced by a battery). [...] In these applications {{the output of the}} rectifier is smoothed by an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter,</b> which may be a capacitor, choke, or set of capacitors, chokes and resistors, possibly followed by a voltage regulator to produce a steady current.|$|E
2500|$|A {{high-pass filter}} (HPF) is an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> that passes signals with a {{frequency}} {{higher than a}} certain cutoff frequency and attenuates signals with frequencies lower than the cutoff frequency. The amount of attenuation for each frequency depends on the filter design. [...] A high-pass filter is usually modeled as a linear time-invariant system. It is sometimes called a low-cut filter or bass-cut filter. High-pass filters have many uses, such as blocking DC from circuitry sensitive to non-zero average voltages or radio frequency devices. They {{can also be used}} in conjunction with a low-pass filter to produce a bandpass filter.|$|E
2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A passive {{crossover}} is an electronic circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. Passive crossover circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, {{passive crossover}}s have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil [...] An active crossover is an <b>electronic</b> <b>filter</b> circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E
50|$|Distributed element {{filters are}} {{constructed}} out of components made from {{small pieces of}} transmission line or other distributed elements. There are structures in distributed element filters that directly correspond to the lumped elements of <b>electronic</b> <b>filters,</b> and others that are unique to this class of technology.|$|R
50|$|The oldest {{forms of}} <b>electronic</b> <b>filters</b> are passive analog linear filters, {{constructed}} using only resistors and capacitors or resistors and inductors. These {{are known as}} RC and RL single-pole filters respectively.More complex multipole LC filters have also existed for many years, and their operation is well understood.|$|R
