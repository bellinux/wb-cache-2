2500|$|The Viet Cong bodies {{sparked the}} first of what would be many controversies that came from the battle. Following what was {{standard}} procedure, Col Hathaway gave orders for the 15 VC KIA to be buried [...] "before they became a health hazard." [...] Major Donald Potter, 1-46 Inf's executive officer, issued instructions that the bodies be buried in an eroded section near the resupply LZ. For reasons that never become clear, five of the bodies were transported instead to the base trash dump. By the time this was noticed, it was past 1200 and the bodies were beginning to bloat in the heat. Rather than move the bodies again, Maj Potter instructed the commander of Company D to [...] "go on and burn them <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> trash dump." [...] Burning the bodies of enemy combatants is considered a war crime, but Potter did not seem to realize this.|$|E
2500|$|On February 15, 2012, Korine {{contacted}} rapper Riff Raff about {{appearing in}} an upcoming film of his which {{would turn out to}} be Spring Breakers. Once the trailer was released there was speculation that the character Alien was based around Riff Raff. According to Franco, his character is based on the underground rap artist Dangeruss, who has a cameo in the film. [...] "Of course Harmony and I looked at some of Riff Raff's videos as inspiration, but he was one of a number of people we looked at. I would say the biggest influence on the role was this local Florida rapper named Dangeruss. He's fairly unknown, but he was <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> place, living the life, and he became the biggest model for me, and he's in the movie." [...] After much back and forth between both camps about the issue, during July 2013 Riff Raff announced he was suing the creators of Spring Breakers for $10 million for [...] "sampling" [...] his life without his permission or a proper producer credit.|$|E
6000|$|... "Critics," [...] I continued. [...] "But--say--if the Major can use {{a fairly}} good {{salesman}} and book-keeper <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> store, let me know, will you?" ...|$|E

50|$|Hood credits God with {{cleaning}} up both him and Harvey from drug addictions {{born out of}} their use in occult rituals:"Praise God, through a supernatural manifestation of the Holy Spirit, God's power came <b>down</b> right <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> room, saved me, delivered me {{right there on the}} spot...".|$|R
6000|$|Does he {{want you}} <b>down</b> <b>there</b> [...] <b>In</b> <b>the</b> Nether Glooms where The hours {{may be a}} {{dragging}} load upon him, [...] As he hears the axle grind [...] Round and round [...] Of <b>the</b> great world, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> blind [...] Still profound Of the night-time?

6000|$|... "I don't know," [...] said Alton gravely. [...] "I {{should like}} to. You see, we want roads and mills, and an office <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you took}} the road to Crystal Spring. It's just <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley, not more than a mile. You'd have been there now if you hadn't turned off at the woods." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to go}} in," [...] whined Reddy Fox. [...] "It's {{nice and}} warm out here, and I {{feel a lot better}} than when I am curled up way <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark." ...|$|E
25|$|Blanche {{was ordered}} from the yards of Thomas Calhoun and John Nowlan, of Bursledon on 9 August 1782 and laid <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> July <b>the</b> {{following}} year. She was launched on 10 July 1786 {{and proceeded to}} Portsmouth where she was coppered in August. She was then laid up for some time, before commissioning in January 1789. Work to fit her for sea had been completed by 25 April that year.|$|R
60|$|It {{was falling}} outward, it fell, {{and on the}} top of it {{appeared}} two great savages waving broad spears. I lifted the pistol, and the bullet that had been meant for Marie's brain scattered that of the first of them, and the bullet which had been meant for my heart pierced that of the second. They both went <b>down</b> dead, <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> doorway.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh! let us thank God, Who, {{after all}} these black months of travel and of danger, has thus brought us {{together}} again," [...] and, kneeling <b>down</b> <b>there</b> together <b>in</b> <b>the</b> guest-hall of the lord of Death, they gave thanks earnestly. Then, moving to {{the centre of the}} chamber where they thought that none would hear them, they began to speak in low voices and in English.|$|R
6000|$|The {{chairman}} looked puzzled, then replied: [...] "If {{my friend}} {{will come up}} here instead of hiding <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark I {{have no doubt that}} Dr. Therne will be able to satisfy his curiosity." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "They'll come back," [...] {{replied the}} other. [...] "It only puts the deal {{off a few}} hours. They'll return, trailin' the whole camp after them. What can I do? My horse is <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> herd." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah'll tell yo' where there's another just as good," [...] replied Unc' Billy. [...] "Yo' see {{the top of}} that ol' chestnut-tree way <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> holler? Well, yo' try that. Ah'm sure yo' {{will like}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|At {{that awful}} moment Kea's words came back {{distinctly}} to my mind. [...] "The second ledge {{that you see}} <b>down</b> below <b>there,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark glow, is the Floor of the Hawaiians: as far as that, only natives may penetrate. If a white man's foot ever treads that floor, Pélé will surely claim him for her victim. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> twinkling of an eye, like a feather <b>in</b> <b>the</b> flame, Pélé will shrivel him in her wrath to ashes." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{reached the}} museum and found it brilliantly lit, but empty except for the cheerful company of the two mummies who also {{appeared}} to regard me with gleaming but doubtful eyes. So I sat <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> front of <b>the</b> fire, not even daring to smoke lest tobacco should complicate Taduki.|$|R
60|$|Jumper {{forgot that}} Whitey {{was only a}} chance visitor from the Far North {{and that it was}} only once in a great while that he came <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> while up <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Far North where he belonged nearly {{everybody}} was dressed in white.|$|R
6000|$|... "At twelve o'clock to-morrow, then," [...] he said. [...] "I wouldn't hurry away now, if I were you. Sit down in {{your old}} place, {{and see if}} there isn't a thread of gold <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> valley." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You {{have the}} whole world at your {{doorstep}} here," [...] said John Meredith, with a long breath. [...] "What a view--what an outlook! At times I feel stifled <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Glen. You can breathe up here." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Steadfast, [...] "it is {{too near}} the road while these savage fellows are about.

6000|$|... "That's all right," [...] he {{said very}} slowly. [...] "Well, I {{wanted to kill}} you, but I don't know that I've a great deal against you now. You and the boys did what you could for me, {{and it was a}} man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> city who held me to it. Oh, yes, he's sitting <b>down</b> <b>there</b> raking <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dollars, and don't care two cents that the man he sent up to make them is dying here. The thing's not square, anyway." ...|$|R
60|$|At {{the sound}} she sprang {{from her bed}} and went to <b>the</b> window. Yes, <b>there,</b> <b>down</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{far corner of the}} yard, without lights or noise, and {{treading}} cautiously, she saw Niaz and his men filing quietly <b>in</b> through <b>the</b> dim gloom, and bringing with them a number of boxes.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I do {{not think}} a woman becomes less of a woman because she dresses and works like a man,' said Edwards. 'You women here, I mean you {{scientific}} women, wear white clothing like the men, twist up your hair <b>in</b> <b>the</b> simplest fashion, go about your work as though {{there was only one}} sex <b>in</b> <b>the</b> world. You are just as much women, even if you are not so feminine, as the fine ladies <b>down</b> below <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> plains who dress for excitement and display, whose only thoughts are of lovers, who exaggerate every difference.... Indeed we love you more.' ...|$|R
60|$|Grace {{directed}} {{the man to}} set her <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midst, and immediately went up to her lover.

6000|$|... "See {{those three}} men <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> village, Byrne?" [...] asked the Frenchman. [...] "They're no more {{aboriginal}} headhunters than I am--they're Japs, man. There {{must be something}} wrong with our trailing, for it's as certain as fate itself that Japs are not head-hunters." ...|$|E
60|$|The four {{who were}} going north {{went down to the}} low tube level. It was nearly the last train. The station was half deserted, half rowdy, several fellows were drunk, {{shouting}} and crowing. <b>Down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> bowels of London, after midnight, everything seemed horrible and unnatural.|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't get it," [...] Cox said, {{shaking his}} head. [...] "I just {{absolutely}} don't get it. Harris, {{is this the}} beginning of the end? Is everything going to start cracking around us? It gives me a hell of a strange feeling to see those people <b>down</b> <b>there,</b> basking away <b>in</b> <b>the</b> sun, just sitting and basking." ...|$|R
2500|$|At {{the end of}} McCormick's tour, Chief of Naval Operations Robert B. Carney {{looked for}} a {{successor}} who would be better at {{standing up to the}} British staff at SACLANT headquarters. [...] "I had felt a great deal of concern about the handling of the United States interests <b>down</b> <b>there</b> and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic, vis-à-vis the British...I had felt that the United States viewpoint had been handled rather naively in some previous instances and that it was imperative that we put somebody <b>down</b> <b>there</b> who could take care of these interests." [...] Carney selected Admiral Jerauld Wright, who relieved McCormick on April 12, 1954.|$|R
60|$|You are still--as {{when first}} I saw, as when I last {{addressed}} you--in the venerable city which I must {{always think of}} as my home. And I have come so far; and the sights and thoughts of my youth pursue me; and I see like a vision the youth of my father, and of his father, and the whole stream of lives flowing <b>down</b> <b>there</b> far <b>in</b> <b>the</b> north, {{with the sound of}} laughter and tears, to cast me out <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end, as by a sudden freshet, on these ultimate islands. And I admire and bow my head before the romance of destiny.|$|R
60|$|She {{stood in}} her white dress, wondering, <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> barge. The lean man sitting near to her watched {{her as if she}} were a strange being, as if she lit up his face. His eyes smiled on her, boldly, and yet with {{exceeding}} admiration underneath.|$|E
60|$|This was done; {{but when}} they {{returned}} {{to the edge of the}} forest all agreed that they should lie <b>down</b> <b>there</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shade until the sun had lost its power, for their position being almost on the equator the heat out on the sand was unbearable.|$|E
6000|$|The plain seemed {{lonely and}} desolate of life, so far below was it. All action {{was lost in}} the mist of immensity--men's stature that of the most minute insects.

60|$|He {{pointed out}} of doors and assured me that <b>down</b> <b>there</b> somewhere <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{blackness}} I'd find the river. I started for the river, got lost <b>in</b> <b>the</b> dark, fell into two or three drifts, gave it up, and returned half-frozen {{to the top of}} the boilers. When I had thawed out, I was thirstier than ever. Around me the hoboes were moaning, groaning, sobbing, sighing, gasping, panting, rolling and tossing and floundering heavily in their torment. We were so many lost souls toasting on a griddle <b>in</b> hell, and <b>the</b> engineer, Satan Incarnate, gave us the sole alternative of freezing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> outer cold. The Swede sat up and anathematized passionately <b>the</b> wanderlust <b>in</b> man that sent him tramping and suffering hardships such as that.|$|R
6000|$|... "Ha! ha! Aralia {{was only}} {{the name of a}} bit of fossil kind of a stick that Merrifield had us <b>down</b> <b>there</b> to find <b>in</b> <b>the</b> fossil forest. I'm sure I saw no forest, only bits of mud and stuff! But he found a bit, sure enough, and was ready to break his heart when he had to leave his bag behind him on the rock. Aralia a young lady! That's a good one." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, Baas, I lost my {{way for the}} fog {{was very}} thick <b>down</b> <b>there.</b> But <b>in</b> <b>the</b> end I found them all right, by my nose, Baas, for those man-eating people smell strong and I got the wind {{of one of their}} sentries. It was easy to pass him <b>in</b> <b>the</b> mist, Baas, so easy that I was tempted to cut his throat as I went, but I didn't for fear lest he should make a noise. No, I walked on right into the middle of them, which was easy too, for they were all asleep, wrapped up in blankets. They hadn't any fires perhaps because they didn't want them to be seen, or perhaps because it is so hot down in that low land, I don't know which.|$|R
