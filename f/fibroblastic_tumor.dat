To determine paracrine factors involved in the epidermal hyperpigmentation, we have studied the expression of cytokines in lesional and nonlesional dermatofibroma skin at the transcriptional and protein levels using reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction and immunohistochemistry, respectively. The number of tyrosinase immuno-positive melanocytes in the pigmented dermatofibroma epidermis is significantly increased (2 -fold) compared with nonlesional normal epidermis. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction analysis of mRNAs encoding stem cell factor and hepatocyte growth factor demonstrated {{that there is an}} accentuated expression of stem cell factor and hepatocyte growth factor transcripts in the lesional dermatofibroma dermis compared with the nonlesional dermis, although there is no difference in their expression between the lesional and nonlesional epidermis. In contrast, mRNA transcripts encoding endothelin- 1, growth-related oncogene α, and basic fibroblast growth factor are not increased in lesional epidermis or in dermis relative to nonlesional skin. In parallel, immunohistochemical analysis using antibodies to stem cell factor and hepatocyte growth factor reveal a marked immunostaining in growing <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumor</b> cells in the dermatofibroma lesions with no detectable staining in the nonlesional dermis, but there is no difference in their immunostaining between the lesional and nonlesional epidermis.

40|$|Abstract. Two dogs {{each had}} a fibrous tumor of {{the central nervous system}}. One tumor {{involved}} the spinal cord and ventral nerve root, and the other involved the midbrain and posterior brain stem. Both tumors had spindle-shaped cells arranged in rhythmic patterns. There was perivascular tumor cell infiltration in the adjacent parenchyma. The tumor cells strongly resembled fibroblasts and seemed to produce collagen. Because both tumors were near nerve roots and because their histological appearances were characteristic of nerve sheath tumors they were classified as central neurofibromas. Collagen producing tumors in the central nervous system mostly are confined to neoplasms of the meninges and associated structures [7, 231. True fibromas of the brain and spinal cord are rare. A recent review of the literature lists only 13 such cases in man, [13] and the existence of such tumors in animals is doubtful [7, 151.

The etiology of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma remains elusive. This investigation was undertaken to determine if human herpes simplex virus- 8 and Epstein–Barr virus are possible etiologic viruses and {{to determine if they}} have any association with the age of the patient and/or the proliferative state of the lesion. Materials and methods Formalin fixed, routinely processed, and paraffin embedded surgical specimens of 15 angiofibromas were submitted to PCR for EBV and HHV- 8, while in situ hybridization was also employed for EBV. Immunohistochemical analysis for ki- 67 was performed using MIB immunostaining. Results None of the tumors were positive for HHV- 8. The PCR technique produced a false positive reaction in five cases, with all cases non-reactive with EBV-ISH. The age of the patients did not show correlation with the Ki- 67 labeling index.

40|$|Abstract: Soft tissue {{tumors in}} very young {{children}} pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. Vascular tumors are the most prevalent soft tissue neoplasms in the neonatal period. They are generally benign tumors, but may exhibit aggressive behaviour and cause life-threatening complications. <b>Fibroblastic</b> <b>tumors</b> of intermediate prognosis, more prevalent in {{very young children}} (especially infantile fibrosarcoma), are locally aggressive. Since metastases are unusual in this group of tumors, complete surgical resection is generally curative. However, these tumors often present a therapeutic challenge because of the location which makes complete surgical resection difficult. Among the malignant soft tissue tumors, rhabdomyosarcoma is most frequent. It is an aggressive high-grade tumor, with local invasiveness and a propensity to metastasize. These tumors respond to chemotherapy and radiotherapy. Neonates with rhabdomyosarcoma {{seem to have a}} worse prognosis than in older age groups. This may be a result of inappropriate dosing of chemotherapeutic agents and decreased use of radiation therapy among other factors...|$|R

40|$|Here, {{we propose}} {{a new model}} for {{understanding}} the Warburg effect in tumor metabolism. Our hypothesis is that epithelial cancer cells induce the Warburg effect (aerobic glycolysis) in neighboring stromal fibroblasts. These cancer-associated fibroblasts, then undergo myo-fibroblastic differentiation, and secrete lactate and pyruvate (energy metabolites resulting from aerobic glycolysis). Epithelial cancer cells could then take up these energy-rich metabolites and use them in the mitochondrial TCA cycle, thereby promoting efficient energy production (ATP generation via oxidative phosphorylation), resulting in a higher proliferative capacity. In this alternative model of tumorigenesis, the epithelial cancer cells instruct the normal stroma to transform into a wound-healing stroma, providing the necessary energy-rich micro-environment for facilitating tumor growth and angiogenesis. In essence, the <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumor</b> stroma would directly feed the epithelial cancer cells, in a type of host-parasite relationship. We have termed this new idea the “Reverse Warburg Effect. ” In this scenario, the epithelial tumor cells “corrupt” the normal stroma, {{turning it into a}} factory for the production of energyrich metabolites. This alternative model is still consistent with Warburg’s original observation that tumors show a metabolic shift towards aerobic glycolysis. In support of this idea, unbiased proteomic analysis and transcriptional profiling of a new model of cancer-associated fibroblasts [caveolin- 1 (Cav- 1) deficient stromal cells], shows the upregulation of both (1) myo-fibroblast markers and (2) glycolytic enzymes, under normoxic conditions. We validated the expression of these proteins in the fibroblastic stroma of human breast cancer tissues that lack stromal Cav- 1. Importantly, a loss of stromal Cav- 1 in human breast cancers is associated with tumor recurrence, metastasis, and poor clinical outcome. Thus, an absence of stromal Cav- 1 may be a biomarker for the “Reverse Warburg Effect,” explaining its powerful predictive value...|$|E
40|$|Recently, we {{proposed}} a new mechanism for understanding the Warburg effect in cancer metabolism. In this new paradigm, cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, and extrude lactate to “feed” adjacent cancer cells, which then drives mitochondrial biogenesis and oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in cancer cells. Thus, there is vectorial transport of energy-rich substrates from the <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumor</b> stroma to anabolic cancer cells. A prediction of this hypothesis is that cancer-associated fibroblasts should express MCT 4, a mono-carboxylate transporter that has been implicated in lactate efflux from glycolytic muscle fibers and astrocytes in the brain. To address this issue, we co-cultured MCF 7 breast cancer cells with normal fibroblasts. Interestingly, our results directly show that breast cancer cells specifically induce the expression of MCT 4 in cancer-associated fibroblasts; MCF 7 cells alone and fibroblasts alone, both failed to express MCT 4. We also show that the expression of MCT 4 in cancer-associated fibroblasts is due to oxidative stress, and can be prevented by pre-treatment with the anti-oxidant N-acetyl-cysteine. In contrast to our results with MCT 4, we see that MCT 1, a transporter involved in lactate uptake, is specifically upregulated in MCF 7 breast cancer cells when co-cultured with fibroblasts. Virtually identical results were also obtained with primary human breast cancer samples. In human breast cancers, MCT 4 selectively labels the tumor stroma, e. g., the cancer-associated fibroblast compartment. Conversely, MCT 1 was selectively expressed in the epithelial cancer cells within the same tumors. Functionally, we show that overexpression of MCT 4 in fibroblasts protects both MCF 7 cancer cells and fibroblasts against cell death, under co-culture conditions. Thus, we provide the first evidence {{for the existence of}} a stromal-epithelial lactate shuttle in human tumors, analogous to the lactate shuttles that are essential for the normal physiological function of muscle tissue and brain. These data are consistent with the “reverse Warburg effect,” which states that cancer-associated fibroblasts undergo aerobic glycolysis, thereby producing lactate, which is utilized as a metabolic substrate by adjacent cancer cells. In this model, “energy transfer” or “metabolic-coupling” between the tumor stroma and epithelial cancer cells “fuels” tumor growth and metastasis, via oxidative mitochondrial metabolism in anabolic cancer cells. Most importantly, our current findings provide a new rationale and novel strategy for anti-cancer therapies, by employing MCT inhibitors...|$|E
40|$|To analyze {{regulation}} of the human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) long terminal repeat (LTR), cell lines were generated from LTR-tax x LTR-beta-galactosidase (beta-Gal) doubly transgenic mouse <b>fibroblastic</b> <b>tumors.</b> The HTLV-I LTR directs expression of both the tax and lacZ genes, and Tax up-modulates both promoters in primary cells. However, once cells were transformed by tax, beta-Gal but not tax expression was suppressed. Supertransformation of these cells with v-src suppressed both beta-Gal and tax expression. This suppression was reversed by treatment with the tyrosine kinase inhibitor herbimycin A or protein kinase A inhibitor H 8. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays demonstrated augmented binding in the R but not U 3 region. This binding was competitively inhibited by a high-affinity CREB oligodeoxynucleotide and super-shifted with a specific CREB antibody. Treatment of cells with the cyclic AMP analog dibutyryl cyclic AMP also transiently increased the R region binding dramatically. In vitro DNase I footprint analysis identified a protein-binding sequence in the R region which corresponded with suppression. However, this target sequence lacked a conventional CREB-binding site. A 70. 5 -kDa DNA-binding protein was partially purified by affinity chromatography, along with a 49 -kDa protein which reacted with CREB-specific sera. These data demonstrate that HTLV-I LTR suppression is associated with CREB factor binding in the R region, probably by direct interaction with a 70. 5 -kDa protein, and provide a novel mechanism for maintenance of viral latency...|$|R

An immunohistochemical study indicated myofibroblastic differentiation of a malignant neoplasm. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, there are only few reported cases of malignant transformation in hemosiderotic fibrohistiocytic lipomatous tumors...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} of the CD 10 antigen, formerly designated as common acute lymphoblastic leukemia antigen and recently identified as neutral endopeptidase, was examined immunohistochemically in 26 benign and in 55 malignant mesenchymal tumors. CD 10 expression was found in 4 of 4 leiomyomas, 7 of 10 leiomyosarcomas, 1 of 6 rhabdomyosarcomas, 2 of 2 Triton tumors, 1 of 2 aggressive fibromatoses, 1 of 3 fibrosarcomas, 1 of 4 synovial sarcomas, 1 of 1 giant cell tumors of tendon sheath, 4 of 4 malignant fibrous histiocytomas, 3 of 3 Ewing's sarcomas, and 2 of 3 osteosarcomas. Furthermore, CD 10 was expressed consistently in the myoepithelial compartment of 12 fibroadenomas and, in 7 of these cases, in a minor stromal cell population, probably of (myo-) <b>fibroblastic</b> origin. <b>Tumors</b> of adipose tissue (4 lipomas, 5 liposarcomas), tumors of autonomic ganglia (2 ganglioneuromas, 1 ganglioneuroblastoma, 2 neuroblastomas), tumors of peripheral nerves with purely schwannian differentiation (7 malignant schwannomas), and tumors of disputed origin were consistently CD 10 -negative, however, as were single cases of fibroma and chondrosarcoma. These findings indicate that the {{expression of}} CD 10 is a frequent but not obligatory feature in some mesenchymal tumors. Therefore CD 10 is of value in the differential diagnosis of mesenchymal tumors...|$|R
40|$|A <b>fibroblastic</b> skin <b>tumor</b> with a myxoid matrix is {{reported}} that cannot be easily classified {{as one of}} the well-known entities of fibrous/fibrohistiocytic and myxoid skin tumors. A 27 -year-old white woman presented with a reddish, dome-shaped cutaneous nodule 8 mm in diameter on the left popliteal fossa that had developed spontaneously within the preceding 2 years. There was no sign of recurrence 30 months after excision. Light microscopic examination showed a well-circumscribed tumor confined to the upper dermis and consisting of stellate and spindle-shaped cells arranged loosely in a fascicular pattern resembling tissue cultures of fibroblasts. There were almost no collagen bundles between tumor cells, and Mowry 2 ̆ 7 s staining showed large amounts of glycosaminoglycans. Immunohistochemical studies of the tumor cells showed reactivity only to vimentin, whereas markers of histiocytes, dermal dendrocytes, and neurogenic and myogenic differentiation were negative. By electron microscopy, the majority of tumor cells contained elliptical nuclei, but some tumor cells had conspicuous multisegmented nuclei with several large and small nuclear segments connected by thin nuclear bridges (labyrinth nuclei). Single fibrils were found within the interstitium; collagen fibers were rare. Histological and ultrastructural examinations identified tumor cells as fibroblasts. High cellularity distinguishes this tumor from cutaneous myxoma. We conclude that this lesion represents a newly recognized <b>tumor</b> of <b>fibroblastic</b> origin. The name cutaneous myxoid fibroblastoma is proposed...|$|R
