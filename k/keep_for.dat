5|$|Henry II visited York Castle {{four times}} during his reign. The royal {{chambers}} {{at the time}} were inside the <b>keep</b> <b>for</b> safety, and Henry paid £15 for repairs to the keep. During his 1175 visit, Henry used the castle as the base for receiving the homage of William the Lion of Scotland. Castle mills were built close by to support the garrison, and the military order of the Knights Templar was granted ownership of the mills in the mid-12th century. The mills proved to be vulnerable to the flooding of the two rivers and had to be repeatedly repaired.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia, Maeser was {{commissioned}} by the church to develop pamphlets on basic church principles. After living there a few weeks, Maeser was called {{to serve as a}} missionary by the LDS Church to the German-speaking community of Philadelphia. Maeser spent some time in Virginia as part of his mission, where he earned <b>keep</b> <b>for</b> himself and his family by giving music lessons. Among Maeser's music students were the daughters of former United States President John Tyler. Maeser returned with Anna to Philadelphia, where he was called by the church to serve as conference president. Maeser and his family left Philadelphia in June 1860 and traveled across the country to Salt Lake City in Patriarch John Smith's company. Maeser arrived in Utah Territory on September 1, 1860.|$|E

5|$|The {{castle and}} {{surrounding}} lands were {{bought by the}} Seymour-Conway family in 1754. By the late-18th century only the north wall of the bailey survived and the roof and upper floors of the keep had badly decayed, and Francis Seymour-Conway, the 2nd Marquess of Hertford, proposed destroying the building in 1805. He was prevented from doing so by the government, {{on the grounds that}} the keep formed a valuable landmark for ships approaching from Holland, wishing to avoid the nearby sandbanks. Francis' son, also called Francis, undertook conservation efforts in 1831, installing a new, relatively flat, lead roof and a replacement upper floor. Francis furnished the top of the <b>keep</b> <b>for</b> use as an apartment by guests. By the 1840s, however, all of the surrounding bailey wall and mural towers had almost vanished, having been quarried for stone, and the foundations could only just be seen.|$|E

5|$|The late 12th-century defences at Framlingham Castle have invoked {{much debate}} by scholars. One interpretation, put forward for example by {{historian}} R. Allen Brown, {{is that they}} were relatively advanced for their time and represented a change in contemporary thinking about military defence. Framlingham has no <b>keep,</b> <b>for</b> example – this had been a very popular feature in previous Anglo-Norman castles, but this castle breaks with the tradition, relying on the curtain wall and mural towers instead. The pattern of ground-level arrowslits at Framlingham were similarly innovative for their time, enabling interlocking and flanking fire against attackers. The design of Framlingham's defences is similar in many ways to Henry II's innovative work at Dover and Orford.|$|E

5000|$|Traditional fish {{smoking in}} Africa is {{essentially}} a drying process to preserve {{the fish in the}} absence of refrigeration. Contrary to fish smoking in temperate climates the fish is not salted and small fish is not gutted. The fish is first cooked over a high fire and then smoke-dried in one to five days (and nights) over a low fire. The smoking time depends on fish size and market demand, sometimes the market wants [...] "fresh-dried" [...] fish, while [...] "hard-dried" [...] fish with a longer storage life is produced for the off season and for distant markets. Fresh-dried fish <b>keeps</b> <b>for</b> up to a week, while hard-dried fish <b>keeps</b> <b>for</b> several months.|$|R

Butter made from fresh or cultured unpasteurized cream is called raw cream butter.
