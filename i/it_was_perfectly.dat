The sail was used only when {{the wall of the}} boilers was cleaned. However, there were still many skeptics, and in 1836, scientific writer Dionysius Lardner declared that: As the project of making the voyage directly from New York to Liverpool, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> chimerical, and they might as well talk of making the voyage from New York to the moon.|$|E
25|$|The Court {{said that}} the {{statutory}} language incorporates all the refinements associated with the language, is a shorthand description of the worker's legal rights. The Court explained that if the petitioner's logic was used, {{there would be no}} stopping point because all contracts would have to spell out every intricacy of every term in the contract. Contracts would thus become massive, and yet there would be no real benefit from the increase in mass. The Court decided that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> reasonable for the union to use terms of art in a contract.|$|E

25|$|Milwaukee's {{founding}} fathers {{had a vision}} for the city: they knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> situated as a port city, a center for collecting and distributing produce. Many of the new immigrants who were pouring into the new state of Wisconsin {{during the middle of the}} 19th century were wheat farmers. By 1860, Wisconsin was the second ranked wheat-growing state in the country and Milwaukee shipped more wheat than any place in the world. Railroads were needed to transport all this grain from the wheat fields of Wisconsin to Milwaukee's harbor. Improvements in railways at the time made this possible.|$|E

Critics also praised Carell's cameo, with many arguing that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> executed.

500|$|Despite all {{the glowing}} reviews, FreeSpace 2 sold poorly. The April 2000 issue of PC Gamer stated that only 26,983 copies {{had been sold}} {{in the first six}} months of its release. These figures were {{acknowledged}} as disappointing, and described as awful by Kulas. [...] He, however, stated that as the team had stayed within budget by sticking to schedule, Volition should at least be breaking even with the estimated final sales of the game. In NowGamer's interview with Jim Boone, a producer at Volition, he stated that this could have been due to joysticks' being sold poorly because they were [...] "going out of fashion" [...] because more modern first-person shooters, such as Quake, were [...] "very much about the mouse and [...] keyboard". He went further on to state [...] "Before that, when we did Descent for example, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> common for people to have joysticks – we sold a lot of copies of Descent. It was around that time [...] the more modern FPS with mouse and keyboard came out, as opposed to just keyboard like Wolfenstein [...] or something.".|$|E

2500|$|Justice Stevens concurred separately, {{on similar}} grounds as Justice Brennan did.

2500|$|Like {{most modern}} {{programming}} languages and unlike earlier Lisps such as Maclisp, Scheme is lexically scoped: all possible variable bindings {{in a program}} unit can be analyzed by reading {{the text of the}} program unit without consideration of the contexts in which it may be called. This contrasts with dynamic scoping which was characteristic of early Lisp dialects, because of the processing costs associated with the primitive textual substitution methods used to implement lexical scoping algorithms in compilers and interpreters of the day. [...] In those Lisps, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> possible for a reference to a free variable inside a procedure to refer to quite distinct bindings external to the procedure, depending on the context of the call.|$|E
2500|$|The cargo {{included}} 4,200,000 {{rounds of}} Remington [...]303 rifle/machine-gun cartridges, 1,250 cases of empty [...] fragmentation shell casings and eighteen cases of percussion fuses, {{all of which}} were listed on the ship's two-page manifest, filed with US Customs after she departed New York on 1 May. However, these munitions were classed as small arms ammunition, were non-explosive in bulk, and were clearly marked as such. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> legal under American shipping regulations for the liner to carry these; experts agreed they were not to blame for the second explosion. Allegations the ship was carrying more controversial cargo, such as fine aluminium powder, concealed as cheese on her cargo manifests, or guncotton (pyroxylene) disguised as casks of beef, have never been proven. [...] In the 1960s, American diver John Light did several dives on the wreck, trying to prove the existence of contraband explosives in Lusitania 's cargo hold, ignited by the torpedo. Light claimed to have found a large hole on Lusitania 's port side, opposite of where the torpedo had struck, though later expeditions disproved his findings. Recent expeditions to the wreck have shown that her cargo holds remain intact and show no evidence of an internal explosion.|$|E

2500|$|Jim Sullivan, {{the local}} Official IRA commander, {{feared that the}} troops would launch a bigger raid and {{instructed}} his men to move weapons out of the area. At about 6pm, Provisional IRA volunteers attacked the troops with improvised hand grenades. A number of soldiers suffered leg injuries. As more troops arrived, [...] "the Officials realized {{that they would have}} to fight" [...] and Sullivan ordered his men to confront the troops. An Official IRA source later said, [...] "The way we looked at it, we were not going to put up our hands and let them take the weaponry. We didn't want the confrontation, but we couldn't surrender". One source said that 60–70 Official IRA volunteers were involved, while another said 80–90. Each was armed with a rifle and at least one revolver. They exchanged fire with the troops and attacked them with grenades. Hundreds of local youths also pelted the troops with stones and petrol bombs. Journalist Simon Winchester later wrote:To anyone who experienced the battle, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> obvious that hundreds and hundreds of bullets were being fired by both sides – and yet the Army had the gall, when asked by reporters later in the weekend, to say that its soldiers fired only 15 shots in sum. The official figures were to be published later: soldiers in the Falls that weekend fired no less than 1,457 rounds.|$|E

However, [...] "Mr. Thomas vetoed [...] when I brought the slate in, and said that he didn't want him around Washington.

Thomas said that he wasn't particularly impressed with the person I was suggesting and said {{it seemed to him that}} I'd do better if I put someone like [...] in." [...] Queried as to his change of heart, Thomas initially denied ever having vetoed Curts, then, when pressed by an incredulous Carney, [...] "finally said he couldn't understand why he had done it, except that somebody must have told him something." [...] Carney immediately nominated Curts for his third star.|$|E
2500|$|Hegel {{made the}} {{distinction}} between civil society and state in his Elements of the Philosophy of Right. In this work, civil society (Hegel used the term [...] "bürgerliche Gesellschaft" [...] though it is now referred to as Zivilgesellschaft in German to emphasize a more inclusive community) was a stage in the dialectical relationship that occurs between Hegel's perceived opposites, the macro-community {{of the state and}} the micro-community of the family. Broadly speaking, the term was split, like Hegel's followers, to the political left and right. On the left, it became the foundation for Karl Marx's civil society as an economic base; to the right, it became a description for all non-state (and the state is the peak of the objective spirit) aspects of society, including culture, society and politics. This liberal distinction between political society and civil society was followed by Alexis de Tocqueville. In fact, Hegel's distinctions as to what he meant by civil society are often unclear. For example, while it seems to be the case that he felt that a civil-society such as the German society in which he lived was an inevitable movement of the dialectic, he made way for the crushing of other types of [...] "lesser" [...] and not fully realized types of civil society, as these societies were not fully conscious or aware, as it were, as to the lack of progress in their societies. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>perfectly</b> legitimate in the eyes of Hegel for a conqueror, such as Napoleon, to come along and destroy that which was not fully realized.|$|E
