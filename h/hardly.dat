5|$|Wind power <b>hardly</b> ever suffers major {{technical}} failures, since {{failures of}} individual wind turbines have <b>hardly</b> {{any effect on}} overall power, so that the distributed wind power is reliable and predictable, whereas conventional generators, while far less variable, can suffer major unpredictable outages.|$|E

5|$|All battleships are top {{heavy and}} tend to settle upside down when they sink. Arkansas settled upside down, but a 1989 diver's sketch of the wreck shows <b>hardly</b> any of the {{starboard}} side of the hull, making it look like the ship is lying on her side. Most of the starboard side is present, but severely compacted.|$|E
5|$|Dhumavati <b>hardly</b> has an {{independent}} existence outside the Mahavidya group. There is no historical mention of {{her before she}} is included among the Mahavidyas. As a goddess of poverty, frustration, and despair, Daniélou associates Dhumavati with Nirriti, the goddess of disease and misery, and Alakshmi, the goddess of misfortune and poverty. Kinsley adds another goddess to the list: Jyestha.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hardly</b> any Zoroastrian {{family was}} able to avoid {{conversion}} to Islam when employed by the Abbasids. Because of their harshness towards unbelievers, and due to their lavish patronage of Persian Muslims, the Abbasids proved to be deadly foes of Zoroastrianism.|$|E

5|$|Makriyannis, {{having been}} ignored by history, and <b>hardly</b> {{mentioned}} by chroniclers of the War of Independence, had {{renewed interest in}} the revolution by offering a significant personal testimony to historical research. Despite this, after the initial interest in the newly published Memoirs, they were <b>hardly</b> cited for almost 40 years. One could say that Makriyannis was forgotten, {{not only as a}} fighter, but also as the author of a text written in Demotic Greek; a text that, besides reproducing the heroic atmosphere of the War of Independence, is also a treasure-house of linguistic knowledge concerning the common Greek tongue of the time.|$|E
5|$|Mr. Ramanujan's {{methods were}} so terse and novel and his {{presentation}} so lacking in clearness and precision, that the ordinary , unaccustomed to such intellectual gymnastics, could <b>hardly</b> follow him.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the war, Prinz Eugen was {{assigned}} to the 1st Battleship Division of Austro-Hungarian Navy. During World War I, the battleship saw limited service due to the Otranto Barrage which prohibited Austro-Hungarian battleships from leaving the Adriatic sea. As a result, she <b>hardly</b> ever left Pola.|$|E

5|$|Several {{parts of}} Debian are {{translated}} into languages other than American English, including package descriptions, configuration messages, documentation and the website.

5|$|The four-horned {{antelope}} is diurnal (active mainly during the day), though it mainly rests or ruminates in dense undergrowth at noon. Though solitary by nature, the {{four-horned antelope}} may form loose {{groups of three}} to five. Groups consist {{of one or more}} adults, sometimes accompanied by juveniles. Males and females <b>hardly</b> interact, except in the mating season.|$|E
5|$|The {{inflorescence}} is <b>hardly</b> in proportion. Male raceme, 30 inches long, {{of which}} 20 are {{occupied by the}} flowers; upper part and flowers clothed with short rusty pubescence.

5|$|The {{song was}} {{featured}} in the 1998 teen film Can't <b>Hardly</b> Wait, during {{a scene in which}} the police break up a house party. The song was also included in the music video game Guitar Hero World Tour, along with an in-game representation of Travis Barker, who becomes available to play upon completing the song in the drum career.|$|E
5|$|There was <b>hardly</b> {{a design}} element {{on the ceiling}} that was not {{subsequently}} imitated: the fictive architecture, the muscular anatomy, the foreshortening, the dynamic motion, the luminous colouration, the haunting expressions of the figures in the lunettes, the abundance of putti.|$|E
